( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Severe Allergic Reactions : Anaphylaxis , urticaria , angioedema , and generalized rash have been reported in patients treated with formulations of mupirocin , including mupirocin cream .
( 5 . 1 ) • • Eye Irritation : Avoid contact with eyes .
( 5 . 2 ) • • Local Irritation : Discontinue in the event of sensitization or severe local irritation .
( 5 . 3 ) • • Clostridium difficile - Associated Diarrhea ( CDAD ) : If diarrhea occurs , evaluate patients for CDAD .
( 5 . 4 ) • • Potential for Microbial Overgrowth : Prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible microorganisms , including fungi .
( 5 . 5 ) • • Risk Associated with Mucosal Use : PIRNUO cream is not formulated for use on mucosal surfaces .
A separate formulation , BACTROBAN nasal ointment , is available for intranasal use .
( 5 . 6 ) 5 . 1 Severe Allergic Reactions Systemic allergic reactions , including anaphylaxis , urticaria , angioedema , and generalized rash , have been reported in patients treated with formulations of mupirocin , including mupirocin cream [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 2 Eye Irritation Avoid contact with the eyes .
In case of accidental contact , rinse well with water .
5 . 3 Local Irritation In the event of a sensitization or severe local irritation from PIRNUO cream , usage should be discontinued , and appropriate alternative therapy for the infection instituted .
5 . 4 Clostridium difficile - Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin - producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibacterial treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
5 . 5 Potential for Microbial Overgrowth As with other antibacterial products , prolonged use of PIRNUO cream may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible microorganisms , including fungi [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
5 . 6 Risk Associated with Mucosal Use PIRNUO cream is not formulated for use on mucosal surfaces .
A separate formulation , BACTROBAN ( mupirocin ) nasal ointment , is available for intranasal use .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In 2 randomized , double - blind , double - dummy trials , 339 subjects were treated with topical mupirocin cream plus oral placebo .
Adverse reactions occurred in 28 ( 8 . 3 % ) subjects .
The following adverse reactions were reported by at least 1 % of subjects in connection with the use of mupirocin cream in clinical trials : headache ( 1 . 7 % ) , rash ( 1 . 1 % ) , and nausea ( 1 . 1 % ) .
Other adverse reactions which occurred in less than 1 % of subjects were : abdominal pain , burning at application site , cellulitis , dermatitis , dizziness , pruritus , secondary wound infection , and ulcerative stomatitis .
In a supportive trial in the treatment of secondarily infected eczema , 82 subjects were treated with mupirocin cream .
The incidence of adverse reactions was as follows : nausea ( 4 . 9 % ) , headache and burning at application site ( 3 . 6 % each ) , pruritus ( 2 . 4 % ) , and 1 report each of abdominal pain , bleeding secondary to eczema , pain secondary to eczema , hives , dry skin , and rash .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials , the following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of mupirocin cream .
Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , estimates of frequency cannot be made .
These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness , frequency of reporting , or potential causal relationship to mupirocin cream .
Immune System Disorders Systemic allergic reactions , including anaphylaxis , urticaria , angioedema , and generalized rash [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient human data to establish whether there is a drug - associated risk with mupirocin cream in pregnant women .
Systemic absorption of mupirocin through intact human skin is minimal following topical administration of mupirocin cream [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No developmental toxicity was observed in rats or rabbits treated with mupirocin subcutaneously during organogenesis at doses of 160 or 40 mg per kg per day , respectively ( 22 and 11 times the human topical dose based on calculations of dose divided by the entire body surface area ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
The estimated background risk in the U . S . general population of major birth defects is 2 % to 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 % to 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
Data Animal Data : Developmental toxicity studies have been performed with mupirocin administered subcutaneously to rats and rabbits at doses up to 160 mg per kg per day during organogenesis .
This dose is 22 and 43 times , respectively , the human topical dose ( approximately 60 mg mupirocin per day ) based on calculations of dose divided by the entire body surface area .
Maternal toxicity was observed ( body weight loss / decreased body weight gain and reduced feeding ) in both species with no evidence of developmental toxicity in rats .
In rabbits , excessive maternal toxicity at the high dose precluded the evaluation of fetal outcomes .
There was no developmental toxicity in rabbits at 40 mg per kg per day , 11 times the human topical dose based on calculations of dose divided by the entire body surface area .
Mupirocin administered subcutaneously to rats in a pre - and postnatal development study ( dosed during late gestation through lactation ) was associated with reduced offspring viability in the early postnatal period at a dose of 106 . 7 mg per kg , in the presence of injection site irritation and / or subcutaneous hemorrhaging .
This dose is 14 times the human topical dose based on calculations of dose divided by the entire body surface area .
The no - observed adverse effect level in this study was 44 . 2 mg per kg per day , which is 6 times the human topical dose .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether mupirocin is present in human milk , has effects on the breastfed child , or has effects on milk production .
However , breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to the drug due to the minimal systemic absorption of mupirocin in humans following topical administration of mupirocin cream [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for PIRNUO cream and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from PIRNUO cream or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations To minimize oral exposure of the drug to children , a breast and / or nipple being treated with PIRNUO cream should be thoroughly washed prior to breastfeeding .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of mupirocin cream have been established in the age - groups of 3 months to 16 years .
Use of PIRNUO cream in these age - groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled trials of mupirocin cream in adults with additional data from 93 pediatric subjects studied as part of the pivotal trials in adults [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In 2 adequate and well - controlled trials , 30 subjects older than 65 years were treated with mupirocin cream .
No overall difference in the efficacy or safety of mupirocin cream was observed in this patient population when compared with that observed in younger patients .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Mupirocin is an RNA synthetase inhibitor antibacterial [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic absorption of mupirocin through intact human skin is minimal .
The systemic absorption of mupirocin was studied following application of mupirocin cream 3 times daily for 5 days to various skin lesions greater than 10 cm in length or 100 cm2 in area in 16 adults ( aged 29 to 60 years ) and 10 children ( aged 3 to 12 years ) .
Some systemic absorption was observed as evidenced by the detection of the metabolite , monic acid , in urine .
Data from this trial indicated more frequent occurrence of percutaneous absorption in children ( 90 % of subjects ) compared with adults ( 44 % of subjects ) ; however , the observed urinary concentrations in children ( 0 . 07 to 1 . 3 mcg per mL [ 1 pediatric subject had no detectable level ] ) are within the observed range ( 0 . 08 to 10 . 03 mcg per mL [ 9 adults had no detectable level ] ) in the adult population .
In general , the degree of percutaneous absorption following multiple dosing appears to be minimal in adults and children .
The effect of the concurrent application of mupirocin cream with other topical products has not been studied [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Elimination In a trial conducted in 7 healthy adult male subjects , the elimination half - life after intravenous administration of mupirocin was 20 to 40 minutes for mupirocin and 30 to 80 minutes for monic acid .
Metabolism : Following intravenous or oral administration , mupirocin is rapidly metabolized .
The principal metabolite , monic acid , demonstrates no antibacterial activity .
Excretion : Monic acid is predominantly eliminated by renal excretion .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mupirocin is an RNA synthetase inhibitor antibacterial produced by fermentation using the organism Pseudomonas fluorescens .
Mechanism of Action Mupirocin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly and specifically binding to bacterial isoleucyl - transfer RNA ( tRNA ) synthetase .
Mupirocin is bactericidal at concentrations achieved by topical administration .
Mupirocin is highly protein bound ( greater than 97 % ) and the effect of wound secretions on the minimum inhibitory concentrations ( MICs ) of mupirocin has not been determined .
Resistance When mupirocin resistance occurs , it results from the production of a modified isoleucyl - tRNA synthetase , or the acquisition of , by genetic transfer , a plasmid mediating a new isoleucyl - tRNA synthetase .
High - level plasmid - mediated resistance ( MIC ≥ 512 mcg / mL ) has been reported in increasing numbers of isolates of S . aureus and with higher frequency in coagulase - negative staphylococci .
Mupirocin resistance occurs with greater frequency in methicillin - resistant than methicillin - susceptible staphylococci .
Cross Resistance Due to its mode of action , mupirocin does not demonstrate cross resistance with other classes of antimicrobial agents .
Antimicrobial Activity Mupirocin has been shown to be active against susceptible isolates of S . aureus and S . pyogenes , both in vitro and in clinical trials [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
The following in vitro data are available , but their clinical significance is unknown .
Mupirocin is active against most isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis .
Susceptibility Test Methods High - level mupirocin resistance ( ≥ 512 mcg / mL ) may be determined using standard disk diffusion or broth microdilution tests . 1 , 2 Because of the occurrence of mupirocin resistance in methicillin - resistant S . aureus ( MRSA ) , it is appropriate to test MRSA populations for mupirocin susceptibility prior to the use of mupirocin using a standardized method .
3 , 4 , 5 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of mupirocin calcium have not been conducted .
Results of the following studies performed with mupirocin calcium or mupirocin sodium in vitro and in vivo did not indicate a potential for genotoxicity : rat primary hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis , sediment analysis for DNA strand breaks , Salmonella reversion test ( Ames ) , Escherichia coli mutation assay , metaphase analysis of human lymphocytes , mouse lymphoma assay , and bone marrow micronuclei assay in mice .
In a fertility / reproductive performance study ( with dosing through lactation ) , mupirocin administered subcutaneously to male and female rats at doses up to 100 mg per kg per day which is 14 times the human topical dose ( approximately 60 mg mupirocin per day ) based on calculations of dose divided by the entire body surface area , did not result in impaired fertility or impaired reproductive performance attributable to mupirocin .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of topical mupirocin cream for the treatment of secondarily infected traumatic skin lesions ( e . g . , lacerations , sutured wounds , and abrasions not more than 10 cm in length or 100 cm2 in total area ) was compared with that of oral cephalexin in 2 randomized , double - blind , double - dummy clinical trials .
Clinical efficacy rates at follow - up in the per - protocol populations ( adults and pediatric subjects included ) were 96 . 1 % for mupirocin cream ( n = 231 ) and 93 . 1 % for oral cephalexin ( n = 219 ) .
Pathogen eradication rates at follow - up in the per - protocol populations were 100 % for both mupirocin cream and oral cephalexin .
Pediatrics There were 93 pediatric subjects aged 2 weeks to 16 years enrolled per protocol in the secondarily infected skin lesion trials , although only 3 were younger than 2 years of age in the population treated with mupirocin cream .
Subjects were randomized to either 10 days of topical mupirocin cream 3 times daily or 10 days of oral cephalexin ( 250 mg 4 times daily for subjects greater than 40 kg or 25 mg per kg per day oral suspension in 4 divided doses for subjects less than or equal to 40 kg ) .
Clinical efficacy at follow - up ( 7 to 12 days post - therapy ) in the per - protocol populations was 97 . 7 % ( 43 of 44 ) for mupirocin cream and 93 . 9 % ( 46 of 49 ) for cephalexin .
