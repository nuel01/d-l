Effective dose equivalents ( EDE ) were calculated in accordance with ICRP 53 ( Ann .
ICRP 18 ( 1 - 4 ) , 1988 ) and gave values of 8 . 61 × 10 - 3 mSV / MBq and 1 . 12 × 10 - 2 mSV / MBq after exercise and rest , respectively .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The structural formula for tetrofosmin is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] When Tetrofosmin is reconstituted with Tc99m pertechnetate , a complex of Tc99m Tetrofosmin is formed and is the active ingredient of the reconstituted product .
When administered intravenously , Tc99m Tetrofosmin shows rapid myocardial uptake and its distribution follows a linear relationship with coronary blood flow .
Tc99m Tetrofosmin is a lipophilic agent that is taken up by the mitochondria of myocardial cells by passive diffusion and appears to accumulate in viable myocardial tissue .
CONTRAINDICATIONS There are no known contraindications for this preparation .
DOSE AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION Depending on the protocol for rest / stress imaging , doses of 10 to 30 mCi ( 370 to 1110 MBq ) are given intravenously PREPARATION • Snap off the plastic lid and place in appropriate lead shielding .
Wipe the septum with 70 % isopropyl alcohol and allow it to dry .
• Using a 10 mL syringe , dilute up to 360 mCi of Tc99m with saline and add to vial .
The total volume should be between 6 mL - 12 mL and the Tc99m concentration should not exceed 30 mCi / mL ( 360 mCi / 12 mL ) .
• After adding the Tc99m , insert a 0 . 22 µm filtered vent needle and , using a separate syringe , withdraw 3 mL of gas from the vial , allowing sterile filtered air into the vial .
Remove vent needle and syringe .
• Mix gently and invert several times for 10 seconds .
• Let stand for 15 minutes at room temperature as the complexes form .
• Inspect vial through a lead glass shield for particulate matter .
Do not use if the solution is not clear .
• Store at 2 ° - 8 ° C ( 36 ° - 46 ° F ) and use within 12 hours after mixing .
Radiochemical purity should be at least 90 % prior to administration • QC info : Solvent – Ethyl Acetate , Strip – Whatman CHR % Tag = top counts / total counts X 100 % STORAGE The preparation should be stored in the refrigerator at 2 - 8 ( C ( 36 - 46 ( F ) and protected from light .
