( 2 ) 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Cream , 0 . 05 % .
Each gram of Clobetasol propionate cream USP , 0 . 05 % ( emollient ) contains 0 . 5 mg of clobetasol propionate in a white to off - white cream base .
Cream : 0 . 05 % ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None None ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the HPA axis doses as low as 2 grams per day .
( 5 . 1 ) • Cushing ' s syndrome , hyperglycemia , and glucosuria can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids .
( 5 . 1 ) • Systemic absorption may require periodic evaluation for HPA axis suppression .
Modify use if HPA axis suppression develops .
( 5 . 1 ) • Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids .
( 5 . 1 , 8 . 4 ) • Local adverse reactions with topical corticosteroids may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids , including clobetasol propionate .
These reactions include : folliculitis , acneiform eruptions , hypertrichosis , hypopigmentation , perioral dermatitis , allergic contact dermatitis , secondary infection , striae and miliaria .
( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Effects on the Endocrine System Clobetasol propionate is a highly potent topical corticosteroid that has been shown to suppress the HPA axis at doses as low as 2 grams per day .
Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency .
This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid .
Because of the potential for systemic absorption , use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression .
In a study including 12 subjects ages 18 years and older with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis involving at least 30 % body surface area ( BSA ) , adrenal suppression was identified in 3 out of 12 subjects ( 25 % ) following 1 week of treatment .
Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids , use over large surface areas , use over prolonged periods , use under occlusion , use on an altered skin barrier , and use in patients with liver failure .
An ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression .
If HPA axis suppression is documented , an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug , to reduce the frequency of application , or to substitute a less potent steroid .
Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids .
Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids .
Cushing ’ s syndrome , hyperglycemia , and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids .
Use of more than one corticosteroid - containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic corticosteroid exposure .
Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from use of topical corticosteroids .
[ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] 5 . 2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use , prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids .
Reactions may include atrophy , striae , telangiectasias , burning , itching , irritation , dryness , folliculitis , acneiform eruptions , hypopigmentation , hypertrichosis , perioral dermatitis , allergic contact dermatitis , secondary infection , and miliaria .
Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible .
Clobetasol propionate is not recommended in patients with acne vulgaris , rosacea or perioral dermatitis .
5 . 3 Allergic Contact Dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation .
Clinical diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be confirmed with patch testing .
If irritation develops , Clobetasol propionate cream , 0 . 05 % ( emollient ) should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted .
5 . 4 Concomitant Skin Infections If concomitant skin infections are present or develop , an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used .
If a favorable response does not occur promptly , use of Clobetasol propionate cream , 0 . 05 % ( emollient ) should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS • The most common adverse reaction is burning / stinging ( incidence 5 % ) ; common adverse reactions ( incidence < 2 % ) are pruritis , irritation , erythema , folliculitis , cracking and fissuring of the skin , numbness of the fingers , tenderness in the elbow , skin atrophy , and telangiectasia .

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Teligent Pharma , Inc . at 1 - 856 - 697 - 1441 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
In controlled trials with clobetasol propionate formulations , the following adverse reactions have been reported : burning / stinging , pruritis , irritation , erythema , folliculitis , cracking and fissuring of the skin , numbness of the fingers , tenderness in the elbow , skin atrophy , and telangiectasia .
The incidence of local adverse reactions reported in the trials with Clobetasol propionate cream , 0 . 05 % ( emollient ) was less than 2 % of patients treated with the exception of burning / stinging which occurred in 5 % of treated patients .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Therefore , Clobetasol propionate cream , 0 . 05 % ( emollient ) should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels .
Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application to laboratory animals .
Clobetasol propionate has not been tested for teratogenicity by this route ; however , it is absorbed percutaneously , and when administered subcutaneously it was a significant teratogen in both the rabbit and mouse .
Clobetasol propionate has greater teratogenic potential than steroids that are less potent .
Teratogenicity studies in mice using the subcutaneous route resulted in fetotoxicity at the highest dose tested ( 1 mg / kg ) and teratogenicity at all dose levels tested down to 0 . 03 mg / kg .
These doses are approximately 0 . 33 and 0 . 01 times , respectively , the human topical dose of Clobetasol propionate cream , 0 . 05 % ( emollient ) .
Abnormalities seen included cleft palate and skeletal abnormalities .
In rabbits , clobetasol propionate was teratogenic at doses of 3 and 10 mcg / kg .
These doses are approximately 0 . 001 and 0 . 003 times , respectively , the human topical dose of Clobetasol propionate cream , 0 . 05 % ( emollient ) .
Abnormalities seen included cleft palate , cranioschisis , and other skeletal abnormalities .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth , interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production , or cause other untoward effects .
It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when Clobetasol propionate cream , 0 . 05 % ( emollient ) is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Clobetasol propionate cream , 0 . 05 % ( emollient ) in pediatric patients have not been established and its use in pediatric patients under 12 years of age is not recommended .
In a study including 12 subjects ages 18 years and older with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis involving at least 30 % body surface area ( BSA ) , adrenal suppression was identified in 3 out of 12 subjects ( 25 % ) following 1 week of treatment .
Four - week HPA axis suppression studies with Clobetasol propionate cream , 0 . 05 % ( emollient ) in pediatric subjects have not been conducted .
Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass , pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression and Cushing ' s syndrome when they are treated with topical corticosteroids .
They are therefore also at greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency during or after withdrawal of treatment .
Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children .
HPA axis suppression , Cushing ' s syndrome , linear growth retardation , delayed weight gain , and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids .
Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include low plasma cortisol levels and absence of response to ACTH stimulation .
Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles , headaches , and bilateral papilledema .
The use of Clobetasol propionate cream , 0 . 05 % ( emollient ) for 4 consecutive weeks has not been studied in pediatric patients under 16 years of age .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Clobetasol propionate cream , 0 . 05 % ( emollient ) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious .
10 OVERDOSAGE Topically applied Clobetasol propionate cream , 0 . 05 % ( emollient ) can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to produce systemic effects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION Clobetasol propionate cream USP , 0 . 05 % ( emollient ) contains the active compound clobetasol propionate , a synthetic corticosteroid , for topical use .
Clobetasol , an analog of prednisolone , has a high degree of glucocorticoid activity and a slight degree of mineralocorticoid activity .
Chemically , clobetasol propionate is ( 11β , 16β ) - 21 - chloro - 9 - fluoro - 11 - hydroxy - 16 - methyl - 17 - ( 1 - oxopropoxy ) - pregna - 1 , 4 - diene - 3 , 20 - dione , and it has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Clobetasol propionate has the molecular formula C25H32ClFO5 and a molecular weight of 467 .
It is a white to cream - colored crystalline powder insoluble in water .
Each gram of Clobetasol propionate cream USP , 0 . 05 % ( emollient ) contains 0 . 5 mg of clobetasol propionate in a white to off - white cream base consisting of cetostearyl alcohol , isopropyl myristate , propylene glycol , cetomacrogol 1000 , dimethicone 350 , citric acid , sodium citrate , purified water , and imidurea as a preservative .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Like other topical corticosteroids , clobetasol propionate has anti - inflammatory , antipruritic , and vasoconstrictive properties .
The mechanism of the anti - inflammatory activity of the topical steroids , in general , is unclear .
However , corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins , collectively called lipocortins .
It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor , arachidonic acid .
Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Clobetasol propionate cream , 0 . 05 % ( emollient ) is in the super - high range of potency as demonstrated in a vasoconstrictor study in healthy subjects when compared with other topical corticosteroids .
However , similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors , including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier .
Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin .
Inflammation and / or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long - term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of clobetasol propionate .
Mutagenesis Clobetasol propionate was nonmutagenic in three different test systems : the Ames test , the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene conversion assay , and the E . Coli B WP2 fluctuation test .
Impairment of Fertility Studies in the rat following oral administration at dosage levels up to 50 mg / kg per day revealed no significant effect on the males .
The females exhibited an increase in the number of resorbed embryos and a decrease in the number of living fetuses at the highest dose .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES In a controlled clinical trial involving patients with moderate to severe plaque - type psoriasis , Clobetasol propionate cream , 0 . 05 % ( emollient ) was applied to 5 % to 10 % of body surface area .
In this trial , there were no clobetasol - treated patients with clinically significant decreases in morning cortisol levels after 4 weeks of treatment ; however , morning cortisol levels may not identify patients with adrenal dysfunction .
