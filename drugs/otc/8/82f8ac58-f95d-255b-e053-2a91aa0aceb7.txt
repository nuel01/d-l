6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Allergic reactions and other idiosyncrasies have rarely been reported .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 1 PregnancyPregnancy Category B It has been shown that fluoride crosses the placenta of rats , but only 0 . 01 % of the amount administered is incorporated in fetal tissues .
Animal studies ( rats , mice , rabbits ) have shown that fluoride is not a teratogen .
Maternal exposure to 12 . 2 mg fluoride / kg of body weight ( rats ) or 13 . 1 mg / kg of body weight ( rabbits ) did not affect the litter size or fetal weight and did not increase the frequency of skeletal or visceral malformations .
There are no adequate or well controlled clinical studies in pregnant women .
However , epidemiological studies conducted in areas with high levels of naturally fluoridated water showed no increase in birth defects .
Heavy exposure to fluoride during in utero development may result in skeletal fluorosis which becomes evident in childhood .
8 . 3 Nursing MothersIt is not known if fluoride is excreted in human milk .
However , many drugs are excreted in milk , and caution should be exercised when products containing fluoride are administered to a nursing woman .
Reduced milk production was reported in farm - raised fox when the animals were fed a diet containing a high concentration of fluoride ( 98 - 137 mg / kg of body weight ) .
No adverse effects on parturition , lactation , or offspring were seen in rats administered fluoride up to 5 mg / kg of body weight .
8 . 4 Pediatric UseThe use of Fluoridex toothpaste in children age 6 - 16 as a caries preventive is supported by pioneering clinical studies with 1 . 1 % sodium fluoride gels in mouth trays in students age 11 - 14 years conducted by Englander , et al . 2 - 4 Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years have not been established .
Prescribing physicians and dentists should consider total fluoride exposure ( dental care plus food , water , and other sources ) when prescribing the product for use in children .
Please refer to the CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS sections .
8 . 5 Geriatric UseSubjects referenced in clinical studies of 1 . 1 % ( w / v ) sodium fluoride , included 15 percent age 65 and over , with 1 percent age 75 and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger clients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in clients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly clients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
10 OVERDOSAGE Accidental ingestion of large amounts of fluoride may result in acute burning in the mouth and sore tongue .
Nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea may occur soon after ingestion ( within 30 minutes ) and are accompanied by salivation , hematemesis , and epigastric cramping abdominal pain .
These symptoms may persist for 24 hours .
If less than 5 mg fluoride / kg body weight ( i . e . , less than 2 . 3 mg fluoride / lb body weight ) have been ingested , give calcium ( e . g . , milk ) orally to relieve gastrointestinal symptoms and observe for a few hours .
If more than 5 mg fluoride / kg body weight ( i . e . , more than 2 . 3 mg fluoride / lb body weight ) have been ingested , induce vomiting , give orally soluble calcium ( e . g . , milk , 5 % calcium gluconate or calcium lactate solution ) and immediately seek medical assistance .
For accidental ingestion of more than 15 mg fluoride / kg of body weight ( i . e . , more than 6 . 9 mg fluoride / lb body weight ) , induce vomiting and admit immediately to a hospital facility .

Enhanced Whitening Mint : Each gram contains 5 mg of fluoride ion in a neutral pH base , consisting of Cellulose Gum , D & C Yellow No . 10 , FD & C Blue No . 1 , Flavor , Glycerin , Mica ( and ) Titanium Dioxide , Poloxamer 234 , Silica , Sodium Laurel Sulfate , Sodium Saccharin , Sorbitol , Water , Xylitol .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY A treatment dose ( a thin ribbon ) of Fluoridex 5000 ppm sodium fluoride toothpaste contains 2 . 5 mg fluoride .
A 4 oz .
tube contains 566 mg fluoride .
Frequent topical applications to the teeth with preparations having a relatively high fluoride content increase tooth resistance to acid dissolution and enhance penetration of the fluoride ion into tooth enamel .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a study conducted in rodents , no carcinogenesis was found in male and female mice and female rats treated with fluoride at dose levels ranging from 4 . 1 to 9 . 1 mg / kg of body weight .
Equivocal evidence of carcinogenesis was reported in male rats treated with 2 . 5 and 4 . 1 mg / kg of body weight .
In a second study , no cParcinogenesis was observed in rats , males or females , treated with fluoride up to 11 . 3 mg / kg of body weight .
Epidemiological data provide no credible evidence for an association between fluoride , either naturally occurring or added to drinking water , and risk of human cancer .
Fluoride ion is not mutagenic in standard bacterial systems .
It has been shown that fluoride ion has potential to induce chromosome aberrations in cultured human and rodent cells at doses much higher than those to which humans are exposed .
In vivo data are conflicting .
Some studies report chromosome damage in rodents , while other studies using similar protocols report negative results .
Potential adverse reproductive effects of fluoride exposure in humans have not been adequately evaluated .
Adverse effects on reproduction were reported for rats , mice , fox , and cattle exposed to 100 ppm or greater concentrations of fluoride in their diet or drinking water .
Other studies conducted in rats demonstrated that lower concentrations of fluoride ( 5 mg / kg of body w eight ) did not result in impaired fertility and reproductive capabilities .
