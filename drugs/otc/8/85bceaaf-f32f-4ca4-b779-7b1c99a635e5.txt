( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Bradycardia and Sinus Arrest : Consider decreasing or stopping dexmedetomidine HCl infusion ; decreasing or stopping other medications that depress sinus node function ; administering anticholinergic agents ( e . g . , glycopyrrolate , atropine ) ; and / or administering pressor agents .
( 5 . 1 ) • • Hypotension : Consider decreasing or stopping dexmedetomidine HCl infusion ; increasing rate of intravenous fluid administration ; elevating lower extremities , and / or administering pressor agents .
( 5 . 2 ) • • Transient Hypertension : Observed primarily during administration of loading dose .
Consider reducing loading infusion rate .
( 5 . 3 ) • • Arousability : Patients can become aroused / alert with stimulation ; this alone should not be considered as lack of efficacy .
( 5 . 4 ) • • Prolonged exposure to dexmedetomidine beyond 24 hours may be associated with tolerance and tachyphylaxis and a dose - related increase in adverse events .
( 5 . 6 ) 5 . 1 Bradycardia and Sinus Arrest Bradycardia and sinus arrest have been reported following administration of dexmedetomidine HCl to young , healthy adult volunteers with high vagal tone or following rapid intravenous or bolus administration of dexmedetomidine HCl .
Bradycardia has also been reported in association with intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine HCl .
Some of these cases have resulted in fatalities .
Dexmedetomidine HCl decreases sympathetic nervous system activity and has the potential to augment bradycardia induced by vagal stimuli .
Elderly patients and patients with advanced heart block , severe ventricular dysfunction , hypovolemia , diabetes mellitus , and / or chronic hypertension are at increased risk of bradycardia following administration of dexmedetomidine HCl .
Closely monitor heart rate and other hemodynamic parameters during administration of dexmedetomidine HCl .
In patients who develop bradycardia , consider decreasing or stopping the dexmedetomidine HCl infusion ; decreasing or stopping other medications that depress the sinus node function ; administering anticholinergic agents ( e . g . , glycopyrrolate , atropine ) to modify vagal tone ; and / or administering pressor agents .
In patients with significant cardiovascular dysfunction , more advanced resuscitative measures may be required .
5 . 2 Hypotension Hypotension has been reported in association with intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine HCl .
Some of these cases have resulted in fatalities .
Elderly patients [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] and patients with advanced heart block , severe ventricular dysfunction , hypovolemia , diabetes mellitus , and / or chronic hypertension are at increased risk of hypotension following administration of dexmedetomidine HCl .
Closely monitor blood pressure and other hemodynamic parameters during administration of dexmedetomidine HCl .
If hypotension occurs , consider decreasing or stopping the dexmedetomidine HCl infusion ; increasing the rate of intravenous fluid administration ; elevating the lower extremities ; and / or administering pressor agents .
5 . 3 Transient Hypertension Transient hypertension has been observed primarily during administration of the dexmedetomideine HCl loading dose and is likely due to the initial peripheral vasoconstrictive effects of dexmedetomidine .
If treatment of the transient hypertension is necessary , consider reducing the loading infusion rate .
5 . 4 Arousability Some patients receiving dexmedetomidine HCl have been observed to be arousable and alert when stimulated .
This alone should not be considered as evidence of lack of efficacy in the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms .
5 . 5 Withdrawal Adverse Reactions Intensive Care Unit Sedation With administration up to 7 days , regardless of dose , 12 ( 5 % ) dexmedetomidine HCl adult subjects experienced at least 1 event related to withdrawal within the first 24 hours after discontinuing study drug and 7 ( 3 % ) dexmedetomidine HCl adult subjects experienced at least 1 event 24 to 48 hours after end of study drug .
The most common events were nausea , vomiting , and agitation .
In adult subjects , tachycardia and hypertension requiring intervention in the 48 hours following study drug discontinuation occurred at frequencies of < 5 % .
If tachycardia and / or hypertension occurs after discontinuation of dexmedetomidine HCl supportive therapy is indicated .
Procedural Sedation In adult subjects , withdrawal symptoms were not seen after discontinuation of infusions of dexmedetomidine HCl less than 6 hours in duration .
5 . 6 Tolerance and Tachyphylaxis Use of dexmedetomidine HCl beyond 24 hours has been associated with tolerance ( reduction in response after longer duration ; a higher dosage of dexmedetomidine HCl is required to produce the same effect that was obtained at a lower dosage ) ; tachyphylaxis ( a sudden decrease in response ) ; and a dosage - related increase in adverse reactions .
Administration duration should not exceed 24 hours [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .

( 2 . 5 , 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Drugs that Can Potentiate the Sedating Effects of Dexmedetomidine HCl Anesthetics ( e . g . , isoflurane , sevoflurane , propofol ) , sedatives / hypnotics ( e . g . , midazolam ) , and opioids ( e . g . , alfentanil ) can potentiate the sedating effects of dexmedetomidine HCl .
Consider reducing the dosage of dexmedetomidine HCl or the co - administered drug .
7 . 2 Drugs without Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Dexmedetomidine HCl Dexmedetomidine HCl had no clinically meaningful effect on the magnitude of neuromuscular blockade associated with rocuronium [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
In clinical trials where other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents were co - administered with dexmedetomidine HCl an additive hypotensive or bradycardic effect was not observed .
Nonetheless , close monitoring of hemodynamic parameters ( e . g . , blood pressure , heart rate ) is recommended if other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents are co - administered with dexmedetomidine HCl .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies conducted with dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in pregnant women to inform any drug - associated risks .
A published in vitro human placenta study reported placental transfer of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride .
Rats subcutaneously administered dexmedetomidine HCl during organogenesis showed pregnancy loss and reduced live pups at doses equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) .
Reduced fetal weights were observed in rats administered subcutaneously dexmedetomidine HCl at a dose that is less than one - half of the MRHD during gestation and lactation .
In this study , elevated fetal and embryocidal toxicity and delayed motor development were observed in second generation offspring .
No fetal malformations were observed in animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of dexmedetomidine HCl during organogenesis in rats and rabbits at doses approximately equal to and one - half the MRHD , respectively [ see Data ] .
The background risk in the indicated population is unknown .
However , the background risk in the U . S . general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 to 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
Data Animal Data Teratogenic effects were not observed in rats following subcutaneous administration of dexmedetomidine HCl during the period of fetal organogenesis ( from gestation day 5 to 16 ) with doses up to 200 mcg / kg ( representing a dose approximately equal to the MRHD based on body surface area ) or in rabbits following intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine HCl during the period of fetal organogenesis ( from gestation day 6 to 18 ) with doses up to 96 mcg / kg ( representing approximately half the human exposure at the MRHD based on plasma area under the time - curve comparison ) .
However , fetal toxicity , as evidenced by increased post - implantation losses and reduced live pups , was observed in rats at a subcutaneous dose of 200 mcg / kg .
The no - effect dose in rats was 20 mcg / kg ( representing a dose less than the MRHD based on a body surface area comparison ) .
In another reproductive toxicity study when dexmedetomidine HCl was administered subcutaneously to pregnant rats at 8 mcg / kg and 32 mcg / kg ( representing a dose less than the MRHD based on a body surface area comparison ) from gestation day 16 through weaning , lower offspring weights were observed .
Additionally , when offspring of the 32 mcg / kg group were allowed to mate , elevated fetal and embryocidal toxicity and delayed motor development was observed in second generation offspring .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride in human milk , the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant , or the effects of the drug on milk production .
Radio - labeled dexmedetomidine administered subcutaneously to lactating female rats was excreted in milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for dexmedetomidine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from dexmedetomidine hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations A lactating woman may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk for 10 hours ( approximately 5 half - lives ) after receivingdexmedetomidine hydrochloride in order to minimize potential drug exposure to a breastfed infant .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine HCl have not been established for Procedural or ICU Sedation in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Intensive Care Unit Sedation A total of 729 patients in the clinical studies were 65 years of age and over .
A total of 200 patients were 75 years of age and over .
In patients greater than 65 years of age , a higher incidence of bradycardia and hypotension was observed following administration of dexmedetomidine HCl [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) ] .
Therefore a dose reduction may be considered in patients over 65 years of age [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Procedural Sedation A total of 131 patients in the procedural sedation clinical studies were 65 years of age and over .
A total of 47 patients were 75 years of age and over .
Hypotension occurred in a higher incidence in dexmedetomidine HCl - treated patients 65 years or older ( 72 % ) and 75 years or older ( 74 % ) as compared to patients less than 65 years ( 47 % ) .
In patients greater than 65 years of age , reduce the loading infusion dosage for initiation of procedural sedation and consider reducing the maintenance infusion dosage for maintenance of procedural sedation [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Since dexmedetomidine HCl clearance decreases with increasing severity of hepatic impairment , consider dosage reduction in patients with hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9 . 3 Dependence The dependence potential of dexmedetomidine HCl has not been studied in humans .
However , since studies in rodents and primates have demonstrated that dexmedetomidine HCl exhibits pharmacologic actions similar to those of clonidine , it is possible that dexmedetomidine HCl may produce a clonidine - like withdrawal syndrome upon abrupt discontinuation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage of dexmedetomidine HCl can cause the adverse reactions generally associated with dexmedetomidine HCl administration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
However , these reactions may be more severe .
Heart block ( e . g . , first degree atrioventricular block , second degree heart block ) has been reported following overdosage with dexmedetomidine HCl .
Cardiac arrest has been reported following loading bolus administration of undiluted Dexmedetomidine HCl Injection .
Dexmedetomidine HCl Injection must be diluted prior to administration [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Management of overdosage should include general supportive measures to sustain the patient through any period of toxicity that may occur .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Dexmedetomidine HCl is a central alpha - 2 adrenergic agonist with sedative properties .
Alpha2 selectivity was observed in animals following slow intravenous infusion of low and medium doses ( 10 mcg / kg to 300 mcg / kg ) .
Both alpha1 and alpha2 activity was observed following slow intravenous infusion of high doses ( greater than or equal to 1000 mcg / kg ) or with rapid intravenous administration .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In a study in 10 healthy volunteers , respiratory rate and oxygen saturation remained within normal limits and there was no evidence of respiratory depression when dexmedetomidine HCl was administered by intravenous infusion at dosages between 0 . 2 mcg / kg / hour and 0 . 7 mcg / kg / hour .
In a study of 10 healthy adult volunteers , administration of dexmedetomidine HCl for 45 minutes at a plasma concentration of 1 ng / mL resulted in no clinically meaningful increases in the magnitude of neuromuscular blockade associated with rocuronium administration .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous administration , dexmedetomidine exhibited the following pharmacokinetic parameters : a rapid distribution phase with a distribution half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of approximately 6 minutes ; a terminal elimination half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of approximately 2 hours ; and steady - state volume of distribution ( Vss ) of approximately 118 liters .
Clearance was estimated to be approximately 39 L / hour .
The mean body weight associated with this clearance estimate was 72 kg .
Dexmedetomidine exhibits linear pharmacokinetics in the dosage range of 0 . 2 to 0 . 7 mcg / kg / hr when administered by intravenous infusion for up to 24 hours .
Table 8 shows the main pharmacokinetic parameters when dexmedetomidine HCl was infused ( after appropriate loading doses ) at maintenance infusion rates of 0 . 17 mcg / kg / hr ( target plasma concentration of 0 . 3 ng / mL ) for 12 and 24 hours , 0 . 33 mcg / kg / hr ( target plasma concentration of 0 . 6 ng / mL ) for 24 hours , and 0 . 70 mcg / kg / hr ( target plasma concentration of 1 . 25 ng / mL ) for 24 hours .

# Mean Css = Average steady - state concentration of dexmedetomidine HCl .
The mean Css was calculated based on post - dose sampling from 2 . 5 to 9 hours samples for 12 hour infusion and post - dose sampling from 2 . 5 to 18 hours for 24 hour infusions .
The loading doses for each of the above indicated groups were 0 . 5 , 0 . 5 , 1 and 2 . 2 mcg / kg , respectively .
Dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetic parameters after dexmedetomidine HCl maintenance doses of 0 . 2 to 1 . 4 mcg / kg / hr for > 24 hours were similar to the PK parameters after dexmedetomidine HCL maintenance dosing for < 24 hours in other studies .
The values for clearance ( CL ) , volume of distribution ( V ) , and t1 / 2 were 39 . 4 L / hr , 152 L , and 2 . 67 hours , respectively .
Distribution The steady - state volume of distribution ( Vss ) of dexmedetomidine was approximately 118 liters .
Dexmedetomidine protein binding was assessed in the plasma of normal healthy male and female subjects .
The average protein binding was 94 % and was constant across the different plasma concentrations tested .
Elimination The distribution half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of dexmedetomidine is approximately 6 minutes , the terminal elimination half - life ( t1 / 2 ) is approximately 2 hours , and clearance is estimated to be approximately 39 L / hour .
Metabolism : Dexmedetomidine undergoes almost complete biotransformation with very little unchanged dexmedetomidine excreted in urine and feces .
Biotransformation involves both direct glucuronidation as well as cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism .
The major metabolic pathways of dexmedetomidine are : direct N - glucuronidation to inactive metabolites ; aliphatic hydroxylation ( mediated primarily by CYP2A6 ) of dexmedetomidine to generate 3 - hydroxy - dexmedetomidine , the glucuronide of 3 - hydroxy - dexmedetomidine , and 3 - carboxy - dexmedetomidine ; and N - methylation of dexmedetomidine to generate 3 - hydroxy N - methyl - dexmedetomidine , 3 - carboxy N - methyl - dexmedetomidine , and dexmedetomidine - N - methyl O - glucuronide .
Excretion : A mass balance study demonstrated that after nine days an average of 95 % of the radioactivity , following intravenous administration of radiolabeled dexmedetomidine , was recovered in the urine and 4 % in the feces .
No unchanged dexmedetomidine was detected in the urine .
Approximately 85 % of the radioactivity recovered in the urine was excreted within 24 hours after the infusion .
Fractionation of the radioactivity excreted in urine demonstrated that products of N - glucuronidation accounted for approximately 34 % of the cumulative urinary excretion .
In addition , aliphatic hydroxylation of parent drug to form 3 - hydroxy - dexmedetomidine , the glucuronide of 3 - hydroxy - dexmedetomidine , and 3 - carboxylic acid - dexmedetomidine together represented approximately 14 % of the dose in urine .
N - methylation of dexmedetomidine to form 3 - hydroxy N - methyl dexmedetomidine , 3 - carboxy N - methyl dexmedetomidine , and N - methyl O - glucuronide dexmedetomidine accounted for approximately 18 % of the dose in urine .
The N - Methyl metabolite itself was a minor circulating component and was undetected in urine .
Approximately 28 % of the urinary metabolites have not been identified .
Specific Populations Age : Geriatric Population : The pharmacokinetic profile of dexmedetomidine HCl was not altered by age .
There were no differences in the pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine HCl in young ( 18 to 40 years ) , middle age ( 41 to 65 years ) , and elderly ( greater than 65 years ) subjects .
Sex : There was no observed difference in dexmedetomidine HCl pharmacokinetics in male and female subjects .
Protein binding was similar in males and females .
Hepatic Impairment : In subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A , B , or C ) , clearance values for dexmedetomidine HCl were lower than in healthy subjects .
The mean clearance values for patients with mild , moderate , and severe hepatic impairment were 74 % , 64 % and 53 % of those observed in the normal healthy subjects , respectively .
Mean clearances for free drug were 59 % , 51 % and 32 % of those observed in the normal healthy subjects , respectively [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
The fraction of dexmedetomidine HCl that was bound to plasma proteins was significantly decreased in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function .
Renal Impairment : Dexmedetomidine HCl pharmacokinetics ( Cmax , Tmax , AUC , t1 / 2 , CL , and Vss ) were not significantly different in subjects with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance : less than 30 mL / minute ) compared to subjects with normal renal function .
Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies : In vitro studies in human liver microsomes demonstrated no evidence of cytochrome P450 mediated drug interactions that are likely to be of clinical relevance .
No pharmacokinetic interactions between dexmedetomidine HCl and isoflurane , propofol , alfentanil and midazolam have been demonstrated [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Proteins : Dexmedetomidine is highly bound to plasma proteins .
The potential for protein binding displacement of dexmedetomidine by other drugs highly bound to proteins ( i . e . , fentanyl , ketorolac , theophylline , digoxin and lidocaine ) was explored in vitro , and negligible changes in the plasma protein binding of dexmedetomidine were observed .
The potential for protein binding displacement of other drugs highly bound to proteins ( i . e . , phenytoin , warfarin , ibuprofen , propranolol , theophylline and digoxin ) by dexmedetomidine was explored invitro and none of these compounds appeared to be significantly displaced by dexmedetomidine .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Animal carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with dexmedetomidine .
Mutagenesis Dexmedetomidine was not mutagenic in vitro , in either the bacterial reverse mutation assay ( E . coli and Salmonellatyphimurium ) or the mammalian cell forward mutation assay ( mouse lymphoma ) .
Dexmedetomidine was clastogenic in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test with , but not without , rat S9 metabolic activation .
In contrast , dexmedetomidine was not clastogenic in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test with or without human S9 metabolic activation .
Although dexmedetomidine was clastogenic in an in vivo mouse micronucleus test in NMRI mice , there was no evidence of clastogenicity in CD - 1 mice .
Impairment of Fertility Fertility in male or female rats was not affected after daily subcutaneous injections of dexmedetomidine HCl at doses up to 54 mcg / kg ( less than the maximum recommended human intravenous dose on a mcg / m2 basis ) administered from 10 weeks prior to mating in males , and 3 weeks prior to mating and during mating in females .
13 . 2 Animal Pharmacology and / or Toxicology There were no differences in the adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) - stimulated cortisol response in dogs following a single dose of dexmedetomidine compared to saline control .
However , after continuous subcutaneous infusions of dexmedetomidine at 3 mcg / kg / hour and 10 mcg / kg / hour for one week in dogs ( exposures estimated to be within the clinical range ) , the ACTH - stimulated cortisol response was diminished by approximately 27 % and 40 % , respectively , compared to saline - treated control animals indicating a dose - dependent adrenal suppression .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine HCl have been evaluated in four randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled multicenter clinical trials in 1185 adult patients .
14 . 1 Intensive Care Unit Sedation Two randomized , double - blind , parallel - group , placebo - controlled multicenter clinical trials included 754 adult patients being treated in a surgical intensive care unit .
All patients were initially intubated and received mechanical ventilation .
These trials evaluated the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine HCl by comparing the amount of rescue medication ( midazolam in one trial and propofol in the second ) required to achieve a specified level of sedation ( using the standardized Ramsay Sedation Scale ) between dexmedetomidine HCl and placebo from onset of treatment to extubation or to a total treatment duration of 24 hours .
The Ramsay Level of Sedation Scale is displayed in Table 9 .
Table 9 : Ramsay Level of Sedation Scale Clinical Score Level of Sedation Achieved 6 Asleep , no response 5 Asleep , sluggish response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus 4 Asleep , but with brisk response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus 3 Patient responds to commands 2 Patient cooperative , oriented , and tranquil 1 Patient anxious , agitated , or restless In the first study , 175 adult patients were randomized to receive placebo and 178 to receive dexmedetomidine HCl by intravenous infusion at a dose of 0 . 4 mcg / kg / hr ( with allowed adjustment between 0 . 2 and 0 . 7 mcg / kg / hr ) following an initial loading infusion of one mcg / kg intravenous over 10 minutes .
The study drug infusion rate was adjusted to maintain a Ramsay sedation score of ≥ 3 .
Patients were allowed to receive “ rescue ” midazolam as needed to augment the study drug infusion .
In addition , morphine sulfate was administered for pain as needed .
The primary outcome measure for this study was the total amount of rescue medication ( midazolam ) needed to maintain sedation as specified while intubated .
Patients randomized to placebo received significantly more midazolam than patients randomized to dexmedetomidine HCl ( see Table 10 ) .
A second prospective primary analysis assessed the sedative effects of dexmedetomidine HCl by comparing the percentage of patients who achieved a Ramsay sedation score of ≥ 3 during intubation without the use of additional rescue medication .
A significantly greater percentage of patients in the dexmedetomidine HCl group maintained a Ramsay sedation score of ≥ 3 without receiving any midazolam rescue compared to the placebo group ( see Table 10 ) .

A prospective secondary analysis assessed the dose of morphine sulfate administered to patients in the dexmedetomidine HCl and placebo groups .
On average , dexmedetomidine HCl - treated patients received less morphine sulfate for pain than placebo - treated patients ( 0 . 47 versus 0 . 83 mg / h ) .
In addition , 44 % ( 79 of 178 patients ) of dexmedetomidine HCl patients received no morphine sulfate for pain versus 19 % ( 33 of 175 patients ) in the placebo group .
In a second study , 198 adult patients were randomized to receive placebo and 203 to receive dexmedetomidine HCl by intravenous infusion at a dose of 0 . 4 mcg / kg / hr ( with allowed adjustment between 0 . 2 and 0 . 7 mcg / kg / hr ) following an initial loading infusion of one mcg / kg intravenous over 10 minutes .
The study drug infusion was adjusted to maintain a Ramsay sedation score of ≥ 3 .

In addition , morphine sulfate was administered as needed for pain .
The primary outcome measure for this study was the total amount of rescue medication ( propofol ) needed to maintain sedation as specified while intubated .
Patients randomized to placebo received significantly more propofol than patients randomized to dexmedetomidine HCl ( see Table 11 ) .
A significantly greater percentage of patients in the dexmedetomidine HCl group compared to the placebo group maintained a Ramsay sedation score of ≥ 3 without receiving any propofol rescue ( see Table 11 ) .

A prospective secondary analysis assessed the dose of morphine sulfate administered to patients in the dexmedetomidine HCl and placebo groups .
On average , dexmedetomidine HCl - treated patients received less morphine sulfate for pain than placebo - treated patients ( 0 . 43 versus 0 . 89 mg / h ) .
In addition , 41 % ( 83 of 203 patients ) of dexmedetomidine HCl patients received no morphine sulfate for pain versus 15 % ( 30 of 198 patients ) in the placebo group .
In a controlled clinical trial , dexmedetomidine HCl was compared to midazolam for ICU sedation exceeding 24 hours duration .
Dexmedetomidine HCl was not shown to be superior to midazolam for the primary efficacy endpoint , the percent of time patients were adequately sedated ( 81 % versus 81 % ) .
In addition , administration of dexmedetomidine HCl for longer than 24 hours was associated with tolerance , tachyphylaxis , and a dose - related increase in adverse events [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
14 . 2 Procedural Sedation The safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine HCl for sedation of non - intubated patients prior to and / or during surgical and other procedures were evaluated in two randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled multicenter clinical trials : • • Study 1 evaluated the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine HCl in patients having a variety of elective surgeries / procedures performed under monitored anesthesia care .
• • Study 2 evaluated dexmedetomidine HCl in patients undergoing awake fiberoptic intubation prior to a surgical or diagnostic procedure .
In Study 1 , the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine HCl were evaluated by comparing the percent of patients not requiring rescue midazolam to achieve a specified level of sedation using the standardized Observer ’ s Assessment of Alertness / Sedation Scale ( see Table 12 ) .

Patients were allowed to receive rescue midazolam as needed to achieve and / or maintain an Observer ’ s Assessment of Alertness / Sedation Scale less than or equal to 4 .
After achieving the desired level of sedation , a local or regional anesthetic block was performed .
Demographic characteristics were similar between the dexmedetomidine HCl and placebo groups .
Efficacy results showed that dexmedetomidine HCl groups were more effective than the placebo group when used to sedate non - intubated patients requiring monitored anesthesia care during surgical and other procedures ( see Table 13 ) .
In Study 2 , the sedative properties of dexmedetomidine HCl were evaluated by comparing the percent of patients requiring rescue midazolam to achieve or maintain a specified level of sedation using the Ramsay Sedation Scale score more than or equal to 2 ( see Table 9 ) .
Patients were randomized to receive : • • A loading infusion of dexmedetomidine HCl 1 mcg / kg over 10 minutes followed by a fixed maintenance infusion of 0 . 7 mcg / kg / hour , or • • A placebo ( normal saline ) given over 10 minutes followed by a placebo infusion .
After achieving the desired level of sedation , topicalization of the airway occurred .
Patients were allowed to receive rescue midazolam as needed to achieve and / or maintain a Ramsay Sedation Scale more than or equal to 2 .
Demographic characteristics were similar between the dexmedetomidine HCl and comparator groups .
For efficacy results see Table 13 .
