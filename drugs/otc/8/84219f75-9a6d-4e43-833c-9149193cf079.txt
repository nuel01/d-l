6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The data described below represent 2530 patients ( 1251 received MOTEGRITY 2 mg once daily and 1279 received placebo ) with CIC from 6 double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trials of 12 weeks to 24 weeks in duration .
In these trials overall , patients were primarily female ( 76 % ) and white ( 76 % ) .
The mean age was 47 years ( range 17 to 95 years ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Common Adverse Reactions Table 2 below summarizes the incidence ( % ) of common adverse reactions occurring in at least 2 % of patients with CIC receiving either 2 mg of MOTEGRITY once daily or placebo and at an incidence greater than in the placebo group from the six double - blind placebo - controlled trials described above .
Table 2 : Common Adverse Reactions [ 1 ] in Double - Blind Placebo - Controlled Trials of CIC of at least 12 Weeks DurationAdverse Reaction MOTEGRITY 2 mg Once Daily N = 1251 [ 2 ] % Placebo N = 1279 % Headache 19 9 Abdominal pain [ 3 ] 16 11 Nausea 14 7 Diarrhea 13 5 Abdominal distension 5 4 Dizziness 4 2 Vomiting 3 2 Flatulence 3 2 Fatigue 2 1 [ 1 ] Reported in ≥ 2 % of patients receiving MOTEGRITY and a rate higher than patients receiving placebo .
[ 2 ] Includes 93 patients who started on MOTEGRITY 1 mg and increased to MOTEGRITY 2 mg .
[ 3 ] Includes abdominal pain , upper abdominal pain , lower abdominal pain , abdominal tenderness , abdominal discomfort , and epigastric discomfort .
Less Common Adverse Reactions Less common adverse reactions occurring in < 2 % of patients receiving MOTEGRITY 2 mg once daily include : Gastrointestinal disorders : abnormal gastrointestinal sounds Metabolism and nutrition disorders : decreased appetite Nervous system disorders : migraine Renal and urinary disorders : pollakiuria Diarrhea Of the patients who reported diarrhea , 70 % ( 110 out of 157 ) reported it in the first week of treatment .
Diarrhea typically resolved within a few days in 73 % ( 80 out of 110 ) of those patients .
Severe diarrhea was reported in 1 . 8 % of patients treated with MOTEGRITY 2 mg compared to 1 % of patients in the placebo group , and had a similar onset and duration as diarrhea overall .
Headache Of the patients who reported headache , 66 % ( 157 out of 237 ) treated with MOTEGRITY 2 mg once daily reported onset in the first 2 days of treatment .
Symptoms typically resolved within a few days in 65 % ( 102 out of 157 ) of those patients .
Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation In the 6 clinical trials described above , 5 % of patients treated with 2 mg of MOTEGRITY once daily discontinued due to adverse reactions , compared to 3 % of patients in the placebo group .
The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea ( 2 % MOTEGRITY , 1 % placebo ) , headache ( 1 % MOTEGRITY , 1 % placebo ) , diarrhea ( 1 % MOTEGRITY , < 1 % placebo ) , or abdominal pain ( 1 % MOTEGRITY , 1 % placebo ) .
Adverse Reactions of Special Interest Adverse reactions of special interest were evaluated in a pool of 28 completed clinical trials ( 19 double - blind and 9 open - label ) for MOTEGRITY at doses including 0 . 5 mg , 1 mg , 2 mg , or 4 mg per day in adult patients with CIC ( the recommended dosage of MOTEGRITY for CIC is 2 mg once daily ) .
The total exposure in the double - blind trials was 565 patient - years in the MOTEGRITY group , 384 patient - years in the placebo group , and 2769 patient - years in the double - blind and open - label clinical trials .
Cardiovascular Safety Analysis In an evaluation by an independent adjudication committee of all potential major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE ) , defined as cardiovascular death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , and nonfatal stroke , the standardized incidence rate ( IR ) per 1000 patient - years for MACE for MOTEGRITY was compared with the IR for placebo .
In the double - blind trials , the IR for MACE was 3 . 5 ( 2 patients out of 3366 ; 1 patient on 2 mg and 1 patient on 4 mg ) in the MOTEGRITY group and 5 . 2 ( 2 patients out of 2019 ) in the placebo group .
When combining the double - blind and open - label trials , the IR for MACE was 3 . 3 ( 9 patients out of 4472 , doses ranging between 0 . 5 to 4 mg ) for MOTEGRITY .
Suicidal Ideation and Behavior In the double - blind trials , one patient reported a suicide attempt 7 days after the end of treatment with MOTEGRITY 2 mg once daily ; none were reported in patients on placebo .
In the open - label trials , two patients reported a suicide attempt and another patient reported suicidal ideation .
Completed suicide was reported in two patients , previously treated with MOTEGRITY 2 mg or 4 mg ; both discontinued MOTEGRITY for at least one month prior to the event .
Observational Cardiovascular Cohort Study The overall cardiovascular safety of MOTEGRITY was assessed using European healthcare databases in a population - based , retrospective , observational , cohort study of adults with constipation .
New users of MOTEGRITY ( N = 5715 ) were matched to new users of polyethylene glycol 3350 ( PEG ) ( N = 29 , 372 ) to estimate the standardized incidence rate ratio ( SIRR ) for MACE , pooled across four data sources .
The 95 % confidence interval for the pooled estimate of the SIRR did not demonstrate an increased MACE risk and excluded a pre - specified safety margin of a three - fold risk of MACE during prucalopride use relative to PEG use .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of prucalopride .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Hypersensitivity reactions : dyspnea , rash , pruritus , urticaria , and facial edema [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Psychiatric disorders : Suicide , suicide attempts , suicidal ideation , self - injurious ideation , depression , anxiety , insomnia , nightmares , and visual hallucinations [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to MOTEGRITY during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by contacting MotherToBaby Pregnancy Studies conducted by the Organization of Teratology Information Specialists ( OTIS ) at 1 - 877 - 311 - 8972 or visiting https : / / mothertobaby . org / pregnancy - studies / .
Risk Summary Available data from case reports with prucalopride use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify any drug - associated risks of miscarriage , major birth defects , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , no adverse developmental effects were observed with prucalopride administration during the period of organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to approximately 390 times and 780 times , respectively , the recommended human dose of 2 mg / day ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In oral embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits , prucalopride was administered to pregnant animals at doses of 5 , 20 , and 80 mg / kg / day throughout the period of organogenesis .
No adverse embryofetal developmental effects were observed in either rats or rabbits up to the highest oral dose of 80 mg / kg / day ( about 390 times and 780 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg / day , respectively , based on body surface area ) .
In an oral pre - and post - natal development study in rats , prucalopride was administered at doses of 5 , 20 , and 80 mg / kg / day .
At the 80 - mg / kg dose ( about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg / day , based on body surface area ) , a slight decrease in overall survival rate of pups after 7 days was observed , which could be due to maternal toxicity observed at this dose .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Prucalopride is present in breast milk ( see Data ) .
There are no data on the effects of prucalopride on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for MOTEGRITY and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from MOTEGRITY or from the underlying maternal condition .
Data In an open - label study in 8 healthy lactating women in the weaning stage , plasma and milk samples were collected at predose ( day 1 and 4 ) , and then 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , and 24 hours ( day 4 ) after a 2 - mg dose of prucalopride was administered once daily for 4 days .
Prucalopride is excreted in breast milk with a milk to plasma AUC ratio of 2 . 65 : 1 ; the average amount passed to the infant was estimated to be 1 . 74 mcg / kg / day , which is about 6 % of the maternal dose , adjusted for body weight .
The prucalopride concentration detected in breast milk during weaning may not reflect the prucalopride concentration in breast milk during full milk production .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of MOTEGRITY have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 2484 patients treated with MOTEGRITY 1 mg or 2 mg once daily in 6 controlled trials of at least 12 - week duration in patients with CIC , 15 % were 65 years of age and over , and 5 % were 75 years of age and over [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients .
In an additional 4 - week double - blind , placebo - controlled dose escalation study in 89 elderly nursing home residents with CIC ( PRU - USA - 26 , NCT00627692 ) , no unanticipated safety issues were identified .
Elderly subjects had higher prucalopride exposure compared to younger subjects .
However , the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride appeared to be related to decreased renal function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Adjust the dosage in elderly patients based on renal function [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance at least 30 mL / min , as determined from a 24 - hour urine collection in the clinical trial ) .
MOTEGRITY is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of adverse reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
A decreased dosage is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance less than 30 mL / min , as determined from a 24 - hour urine collection in the clinical trial ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Avoid MOTEGRITY in patients with end - stage renal disease requiring dialysis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE An overdose may result in appearance of symptoms from an exaggeration of the known pharmacodynamic effects of prucalopride and includes headache , nausea , and diarrhea .
Specific treatment is not available for MOTEGRITY overdose .
Should an overdose occur , treat symptomatically and institute supportive measures , as required .
Extensive fluid loss from diarrhea or vomiting may require correction of electrolyte disturbances .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Prucalopride , a selective serotonin type 4 ( 5 - HT4 ) receptor agonist , is a gastrointestinal ( GI ) prokinetic agent that stimulates colonic peristalsis ( high - amplitude propagating contractions [ HAPCs ] ) , which increases bowel motility .
Prucalopride was devoid of effects mediated via 5 - HT2A , 5 - HT2B , 5 - HT3 , motilin or CCK - A receptors in vitro at concentrations exceeding 5 - HT4 receptor affinity by 150 - fold or greater .
In isolated GI tissues from various animal species , prucalopride facilitated acetylcholine release to enhance the amplitude of contractions and stimulate peristalsis .
In rats and dogs , prucalopride stimulated gastrointestinal motility with contractions starting from the proximal colon to the anal sphincter .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics High Amplitude Propagating Contractions Following a single 2 - mg dose of prucalopride in patients with CIC , prucalopride increased the number of high amplitude propagating contractions ( HAPCs ) during the first 12 hours as compared with an osmotic laxative treatment .
In addition , prucalopride 4 mg once daily ( 2 times the maximum human recommended dose of 2 mg ) for 7 days increased the amplitude of HAPCs in healthy subjects without affecting colonic phasic activity as compared with placebo .
Colonic Transit Time An integrated analysis of 3 randomized , placebo - controlled , dose - finding studies in 280 patients with CIC showed that after once daily treatment with 2 mg of prucalopride , the mean colonic transit time was reduced by 12 hours from a baseline of 65 hours for prucalopride 2 mg , compared to an increase of 0 . 5 hours from a baseline of 66 hours in the placebo group .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 5 times the maximum approved recommended dose , MOTEGRITY does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride has been evaluated in healthy subjects and is dose - proportional within and beyond the therapeutic range ( tested up to 20 mg , 10 times the maximum approved recommended dose ) .
Prucalopride administered once daily displays time - independent kinetics during prolonged treatment .
With once daily administration of 2 mg prucalopride , pharmacokinetic steady - state is attained within 3 to 4 days , and steady - state plasma concentrations fluctuate between trough and peak values of 2 . 5 and 7 ng / mL , respectively , with mean plasma AUC0 - 24 h of 109 ng ∙ h / mL .
The accumulation ratio after once daily dosing ranged from 1 . 9 to 2 . 3 .
The terminal half - life is approximately 1 day .
Pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with CIC are similar to those seen in healthy subjects .
Absorption Following a single oral dose of 2 mg prucalopride in healthy subjects , peak plasma concentrations are observed within 2 to 3 hours after administration .
The absolute oral bioavailability is > 90 % .
Effect of Food Concomitant intake with a high - fat meal ( 1000 kcal total , 500 kcal from fat ) does not influence the oral bioavailability of prucalopride [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Distribution Prucalopride has a steady - state volume of distribution ( Vss ) of 567 liters after intravenous administration .
The plasma protein binding of prucalopride is approximately 30 % .
Elimination Renal excretion is the main route of elimination of prucalopride .
Non - renal elimination contributes up to about 35 % of the total .
The plasma clearance of prucalopride averages 317 mL / min .
Metabolism Prucalopride is a substrate of CYP3A4 , in vitro .
In an oral dose study with radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects , prucalopride made up 92 to 94 % of the total radioactivity in plasma .
There are 7 different known minor metabolites , the most abundant metabolite ( O - desmethyl prucalopride acid ) represents 0 to 1 . 7 % of the total plasma exposure .
Excretion Following oral administration of radiolabeled prucalopride in healthy subjects , 60 to 65 % of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in urine and about 5 % in feces .
On average , 84 . 2 % of administered radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 13 . 3 % of the dose was recovered in feces .
Seven metabolites were recovered in urine and feces , with the most abundant metabolite ( O - desmethyl prucalopride acid ) accounting for 3 . 2 % and 3 . 1 % of the dose in urine and feces , respectively .
None of the other metabolites accounted for more than 3 % of the dose .
Renal elimination of prucalopride involves both passive filtration and active secretion .
Use in Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetic analysis of a combined study population of 1343 subjects indicated that there were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of prucalopride based on age ( 17 - 95 years ) , sex , race ( 89 % white , 7 % black , 4 % other ) , or body weight ( 37 - 161 kg ) , after accounting for the effect of renal function .
Geriatric Patients After once daily dosing of 1 mg , peak plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) and AUC of prucalopride in geriatric subjects were 26 % to 28 % higher than in younger adult subjects .
The effect of age appeared to be related to decreased renal function in the elderly .
Additionally , a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that age was not a significant covariate , after accounting for the effect of renal function [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Patients with Renal Impairment After a single 2 - mg oral dose , the mean AUC0 - inf of prucalopride increased 1 . 23 - fold in subjects with mild renal impairment ( creatinine clearance 60 to ≤ 89 mL / min ) , 1 . 4 - fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance 30 to ≤ 59 mL / min ) , and 2 . 38 - fold in subjects with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance 15 to ≤ 29 mL / min ) , compared to subjects with normal renal function .
The pharmacokinetics of prucalopride in patients with end - stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis is not fully known [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment After a single oral dose of 2 mg , Cmax and AUC of prucalopride were on average 10 to 20 % higher in subjects with moderate ( Child - Pugh B ) and severe ( Child - Pugh C ) hepatic impairment than in subjects with normal hepatic function .
This effect is not considered to be clinically significant .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Prucalopride on Other Drugs Erythromycin Co - administration of oral erythromycin ( 500 mg four times daily ) with prucalopride increased the erythromycin mean Cmax by 40 % and mean AUC0 - 24 h by 28 % .
The mechanism for this interaction is not clear .
The increased exposure to erythromycin is unlikely to be clinically significant .
Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics ( no more than a 10 % change in AUC ) of the following drugs were observed when co - administered with prucalopride : warfarin , digoxin , paroxetine , or oral contraceptives ( ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone ) .
Effect of Other Drugs on Prucalopride Ketoconazole Ketoconazole ( 200 mg twice daily ) , a strong CYP3A inhibitor and inhibitor of P - gp and BCRP , increased the Cmax and AUC of prucalopride by approximately 40 % .
This effect is unlikely to be clinically significant .
Other Drugs No clinically significant differences in prucalopride pharmacokinetics ( no more than a 10 % change in AUC ) were observed when co - administered with erythromycin , probenecid , cimetidine , or paroxetine .
In Vitro Studies Based on in vitro study results , the potential for prucalopride to inhibit CYP enzymes ( 1A2 , 2A6 , 2B6 , 2C8 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 2E1 , and 3A4 ) and transporters ( P - gp , BCRP , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OAT1 , OAT3 , OCT1 , OCT2 , MATE1 , MATE2 - K , BSEP , and MRP2 transporters ) or induce CYP enzymes ( 1A2 , 2B6 , and 3A4 ) is low at the clinical concentration .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 2 - year carcinogenicity study in mice , prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 10 , 20 , and 80 mg / kg .
An increased incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas was observed in female mice at 80 mg / kg / day .
The finding is considered rodent - specific .
No significant neoplastic changes were seen in male mice dosed up to 80 mg / kg / day and in female mice dosed up to 20 mg / kg / day ( exposure ratio of 219 and 24 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female mice , respectively , based on AUC ) .
In a 2 - year carcinogenicity study in rats , prucalopride was given by daily oral gavage at doses of 5 , 20 , and 80 mg / kg in males and 5 , 10 , and 40 mg / kg in females .
In male and female rats there was a significant increase in the incidences of benign tumors , including hepatocellular adenomas , thyroid follicular adenomas , and mammary gland fibroadenomas .
An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas , pancreas islet cell adenomas , and adrenal gland benign pheochromocytomas was also seen in male rats .
The increases in neoplastic changes occurred primarily at the high dose of 80 mg / kg / day in male rats and 40 mg / kg / day in female rats ( exposure ratios 556 times ( males ) and 495 times ( females ) the human dosage of 2 mg per day , based on AUC ) .
There was no significant increase in tumor incidence at doses up to 20 mg / kg / day in male rats and up to 10 mg / kg / day in female rats ( exposure ratios of 63 and 40 times the human dosage of 2 mg per day in male and female rats , respectively , based on AUC ) .
In a 12 - month carcinogenicity study in neonatal mice , prucalopride was administered by oral gavage at total dosages of 75 , 150 , and 300 mg / kg given across 2 doses on day 8 of age ( one - third of total dosage ) and day 15 of age ( two - thirds of total dosage ) .
Prucalopride was not tumorigenic at doses up to 300 mg / kg ( > 1600 times the human exposure at 2 mg per day , based on AUC ) .
Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the increase in tumor incidence in rodents related to stimulation of prolactin in endocrine tissues was associated with dopamine D2 antagonist activity .
The hepatic and thyroid tumors were due to induction of enzymes in liver and subsequent disruption of thyroid homeostasis .
Mutagenesis Prucalopride was tested in a battery of assays , including the Ames bacterial mutation assay in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , mouse lymphoma assay , chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes , micronucleus test in mice , Vitotox test , and in vitro Unscheduled DNA Synthesis ( UDS ) studies .
Prucalopride tested positive in the Ames bacterial mutation assay in the S . typhimurium TA100 strain , at concentrations ≥ 500 mcg / plate , both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation .
Prucalopride was negative in other assays evaluating mutagenesis , including in vitro mammalian - based assays ( e . g . , mouse lymphoma assay , chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes ) and in vivo tests ( e . g . , micronucleus test in mice , a UDS test , a gene mutation assay in Big Blue transgenic rats , and a 32 P - postlabeling study in target tissues identified in the carcinogenicity studies , including liver , mammary gland , thyroid , and adrenal tissues ) .
Based on the weight of evidence , prucalopride does not appear to have a mutagenic potential .
Impairment of Fertility In an oral fertility and early embryonic development study performed in rats at doses of 5 , 20 , and 80 mg / kg / day , there was no evidence of adverse effects on fertility at doses up to 20 mg / kg .
At the highest dose of 80 mg / kg ( about 390 times the recommended human dose of 2 mg / day , based on body surface area ) , an increase in pre - coital interval , pseudo - pregnancies , and pre - implantation loss were seen .
These effects could be secondary to increased prolactin secretion with prucalopride treatment .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology In safety pharmacology studies , no relevant effects were observed in any of the cardiovascular studies at concentrations at least 50 times the human therapeutic Cmax .
Prucalopride had no effect on potassium current in hERG - transfected HEK cells at concentrations up to 1 micromolar ( 50 times the human therapeutic Cmax ) .
At concentrations ≥ 3 micromolar , concentration - dependent inhibition of the current was observed ( IC50 = 22 micromolar ; 1100 times the human therapeutic Cmax ) .
In studies in pigs , minor and transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure were noted upon first exposure to prucalopride , at plasma levels at least 10 times the human therapeutic Cmax .
In repeated - dose toxicology studies in male rats , increases in heart weight ( up to 9 % ) were observed at doses of 20 mg / kg / day or higher ( at least 75 times the human therapeutic AUC ) .
Cardiac histology revealed an increase in focal infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells in the heart at a dose of 80 mg / kg / day ( at least 785 times the human therapeutic AUC ) .
In dogs , no changes in heart rate , blood pressure , electrocardiogram parameters , heart weight , or cardiac histology were observed at any dose tested ( the highest dose of 30 mg / kg / day was 572 times the human therapeutic AUC ) .
In vitro studies demonstrated no effect of prucalopride on either contractile responses in human , canine , and porcine coronary arteries at concentrations up to 10 micromolar ( 500 times the human clinical Cmax ) or on platelet aggregation at concentrations up to 200 nanomolar ( 10 times the human clinical Cmax ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of MOTEGRITY for the treatment of CIC was evaluated in six double - blind , placebo - controlled , randomized , multicenter clinical trials in 2484 adult patients ( Studies 1 to 6 ; see Table 3 ) .
Studies 1 through 5 were 12 - week treatment duration and Study 6 included 24 weeks of treatment .
Patients less than 65 years were dosed with MOTEGRITY 2 mg once daily .
In Studies 2 and 6 , the geriatric patients started on MOTEGRITY 1 mg once daily and , if necessary , the dose was increased to 2 mg after 2 or 4 weeks of treatment in the event of insufficient response at 1 mg ; of these patients 81 % increased to 2 mg .
