1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fenoldopam injection is a dopaminergic agonist indicated : • • In adult patients for short term management of severe hypertension when rapid and reversible reduction of blood pressure is clinically indicated , including for malignant hypertension with deteriorating end - organ function ( 1 . 1 ) .
• • In pediatric patients for short - term reduction in blood pressure ( 1 . 2 ) .
1 . 1 Adult Patients Fenoldopam is indicated for in - hospital , short - term ( up to 48 hours ) management of severe hypertension when rapid , but quickly reversible , emergency reduction of blood pressure is clinically indicated , including malignant hypertension with deteriorating end - organ function .
Transition to oral therapy with another agent can begin at any time after blood pressure is stable during fenoldopam infusion .
1 . 2 Pediatric Patients Fenoldopam is indicated for in - hospital , short - term ( up to 4 hours ) reduction in blood pressure [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • • Adults : Initiate dosing at 0 . 01 to 0 . 3 mcg / kg / min by continuous infusion .
Dosing can be increased in increments of 0 . 05 to 0 . 1 mcg / kg / minute every 15 minutes or longer until target blood pressure is reached ( 2 . 1 ) .
• • Dilute prior to administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 ) .
• • Pediatrics : Initiate dosing at 0 . 2 mcg / kg / minute by continuous infusion and titrate dose by 0 . 3 to 0 . 5 mcg / kg / min every 20 - 30 minutes to a maximum dose of 0 . 8 mcg / kg / minute ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 ) .
2 . 1 Recommended Dosage Adult Patients Initiate dosing at 0 . 01 to 0 . 3 mcg / kg / min as a continuous intravenous infusion .
Dosing may be increased in increments of 0 . 05 to 0 . 1 mcg / kg / minute every 15 minutes or longer , until target blood pressure is reached [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] ; the maximal infusion rate reported in clinical studies was 1 . 6 mcg / kg / minute .
Doses lower than 0 . 1 mcg / kg / min and slow up - titration have been associated with less reflex tachycardia .
Maintenance infusions may be continued for up to 48 hours .
Oral antihypertensive agents can be added during fenoldopam infusion or after discontinuation .
Pediatric Patients Initiate dosing at 0 . 2 mcg / kg / minute and titrate dose by 0 . 3 to 0 . 5 mcg / kg / min every 20 - 30 minutes to a maximum dose of 0 . 8 mcg / kg / minute .
Higher doses generally produced no further decreases in Mean Arterial Pressure ( MAP ) but did worsen tachycardia .
2 . 2 Preparation and Administration Dilute contents of vials with 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection or 5 % Dextrose in Water before infusion .
Each vial is for single use only .
Discard diluted solution if not being administered to a patient after 4 hours at room temperature or 24 hours at refrigerated temperature .
Inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
If particulate matter or cloudiness is observed , discard the drug .

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Fenoldopam causes a dose - related tachycardia , particularly with infusion rates above 0 . 1 mcg / kg / min ( 5 . 1 ) .
• • Hypokalemia : Monitor potassium levels ( 5 . 2 ) .
• • Increased intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma or intraocular hypertension ( 5 . 3 ) .
• • Contains sodium metabisulfite , a sulfite that may cause allergic - type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms in susceptible patients ( 5 . 4 ) .
5 . 1 Tachycardia Fenoldopam causes a dose - related tachycardia , particularly with infusion rates above 0 . 1 mcg / kg / min in adults and > 0 . 8 mcg / kg / min in pediatric patients .
Tachycardia in adults may diminish with continued therapy at doses of fenoldopam of < 0 . 1 mcg / kg / min .
5 . 2 Hypokalemia Hypokalemia has been observed after less than 6 hours of fenoldopam infusion .
Hypokalemia reflects a pressure natriuresis with enhanced potassium - sodium exchange or a direct drug effect .
Monitor serum potassium levels .
5 . 3 Increased Intraocular Pressure In a clinical study of 12 patients with open - angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension ( mean baseline intraocular pressure was 29 . 2 mm Hg with a range of 22 to 33 mm Hg ) , infusion of fenoldopam at escalating doses ranging from 0 . 05 to 0 . 5 mcg / kg / min over a 3 . 5 hour period caused a dose - dependent increase in intraocular pressure ( IOP ) .
At the peak effect , the intraocular pressure was raised by a mean of 6 . 5 mm Hg ( range - 2 to + 8 . 5 mm Hg , corrected for placebo effect ) .
Upon discontinuation of the fenoldopam infusion , the IOP returned to baseline values within 2 hours .
5 . 4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite Contains sodium metabisulfite , a sulfite that may cause allergic - type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life - threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people .
The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low .
Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in non - asthmatic people .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common events ( occurring in more than 5 % of patients ) reported associated with use are headache , cutaneous dilation ( flushing ) , nausea , and hypotension ( 6 . 1 ) .
To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Pfizer Inc . at 1 - 800 - 438 - 1985 , or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The most common reactions associated with fenoldopam use are headache , cutaneous dilation ( flushing ) , nausea , and hypotension , each reported in more than 5 % of patients .
Adverse reactions occurring more than once in any dosing group ( once if potentially important or plausibly drug - related ) in the fixed - dose constant - infusion studies are presented in Table 3 .
There was no clear dose relationship , except possibly for headache , nausea , flushing .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Voluntary reports of adverse reactions temporally associated with CORLOPAM that have been received since market introduction include the following : Cardiac Disorders — Cardiogenic shock Vascular Disorders — Hypotension Gastrointestinal Disorders — Abdominal distension Investigations — Electrocardiogram ST segment depression , oxygen saturation decreased 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Beta - blockers : Avoid concomitant use ( 7 . 1 ) .
7 . 1 Beta - Blockers Avoid concomitant use of fenoldopam with beta - blockers .
If the drugs are used together , blood pressure should be monitored frequently because hypotension could result from beta - blocker inhibition of the sympathetic reflex response to fenoldopam .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient data regarding CORLOPAM use in pregnancy to evaluate for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal studies , there was no evidence of teratogenicity or fetotoxicity when fenoldopam was orally administered to rats and rabbits during organogenesis ( see Data ) .
There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with severe hypertension ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk Severe hypertension can result in maternal stroke , pulmonary edema , myocardial ischemia or death of the mother or fetus .
Data Animal Data Oral reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses of 12 . 5 to 200 mg / kg / day and 6 . 25 to 25 mg / kg / day , respectively , administered during the period of organogenesis .
Studies have revealed maternal toxicity at the highest doses tested but no evidence of harm to the fetus due to fenoldopam .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of fenoldopam in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Fenoldopam is present in rat milk .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
Because of the potential for severe adverse reactions in the breastfed infant , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with CORLOPAM .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of fenoldopam have been established in the age groups age < 1 month ( at least 2 kg or full term ) to 12 years old requiring blood pressure reduction [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
The adverse event profile in pediatric patients is similar to that seen in adults .
The pharmacokinetics of fenoldopam are independent of age when corrected for body weight .
The long - term effects of fenoldopam on growth and development have not been studied .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of fenoldopam did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should start at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
10 OVERDOSAGE The most likely reaction in a fenoldopam overdose would be excessive hypotension which should be treated with drug discontinuation and appropriate supportive measures .
11 DESCRIPTION CORLOPAM ( Fenoldopam Mesylate Injection , USP ) is a dopamine D1 - like receptor agonist .
The product is formulated as a solution to be diluted for intravenous infusion .
Chemically it is 6 - chloro - 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 - tetrahydro - 1 - ( 4 - hydroxyphenyl ) - [ 1 H ] - 3 - benzazepine - 7 , 8 - diol methanesulfonate with the following structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] fenoldopam mesylate Fenoldopam mesylate is a white to off - white powder with a molecular weight of 401 . 87 and a molecular formula of C16H16ClNO3 • CH3SO3H .
It is sparingly soluble in water , ethanol and methanol , and is soluble in propylene glycol .
Each 1 mL contains , in sterile aqueous solution , citric acid 3 . 44 mg ; fenoldopam mesylate equivalent to fenoldopam 10 mg ; propylene glycol 518 mg ; sodium citrate dihydrate 0 . 61 mg ; sodium metabisulfite 1 mg .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Fenoldopam is a rapid - acting vasodilator .
It is an agonist for D1 - like dopamine receptors and binds with moderate affinity to α2 - adrenoceptors .
It has no significant affinity for D2 - like receptors , α1 and β - adrenoceptors , 5HT1 and 5HT2 receptors , or muscarinic receptors .
Fenoldopam is a racemic mixture with the R - isomer responsible for the biological activity .
The R - isomer has approximately 250 - fold higher affinity for D1 - like receptors than does the S - isomer .
In non - clinical studies , fenoldopam had no agonist effect on presynaptic D2 - like dopamine receptors , or α - or β - adrenoceptors , nor did it affect angiotensin - converting enzyme activity .
Fenoldopam may increase norepinephrine plasma concentration .
In animals , fenoldopam has vasodilating effects in coronary , renal , mesenteric and peripheral arteries .
All vascular beds , however , do not respond uniformly to fenoldopam .
Vasodilating effects have been demonstrated in renal efferent and afferent arterioles .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Mild to Moderate Hypertension In a randomized double - blind , placebo - controlled , 5 - group study in 32 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension ( diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 119 mm Hg ) , and a mean baseline pressure of about 154 / 98 mm Hg , and heart rate of about 75 bpm , fixed - rate IV infusions of fenoldopam produced dose - related reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures .
Infusions were maintained at a fixed rate for 48 hours .
Table 4 shows the results of the study .
The onset of response was rapid at all infusion rates , with the 15 - minute response representing 50 to 100 % of the 1 hour response in all groups .
There was some suggestion of partial tolerance at 48 hours in the 2 higher dose infusions , but a substantial effect persisted through 48 hours .
When infusions were stopped , blood pressure gradually returned to pretreatment values with no evidence of rebound .
This study suggests that there is no greater response to 0 . 8 mcg / kg / min than to 0 . 4 mcg / kg / min .

Infusion rates could be doubled after one hour if clinically indicated .
There were dose - related , rapid - onset , decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures and increases in heart rate ( Table 5 ) .

The response rate was 79 % ( 92 / 117 ) in the fenoldopam group and 77 % ( 90 / 119 ) in the nitroprusside group .
Response required a decline in supine diastolic blood pressure to less than 110 mmHg if the baseline were between 120 and 150 mmHg , inclusive , or by ≥ 40 mmHg if the baseline were ≥ 150 mmHg .
Patients were titrated to the desired effect .
For fenoldopam , the dose ranged from 0 . 1 to 1 . 5 mcg / kg / min ; for nitroprusside , the dose ranged from 1 to 8 mcg / kg / min .
As in the study in mild to moderate hypertensives , most of the effect seen at 1 hour is present at 15 minutes .
The additional effect seen after 1 hour occurs in all groups and may not be drug - related ( there was no placebo group for evaluation ) .
Hypertension in Pediatric Patients In a randomized , multi - center , double - blind , placebo - controlled , dose - ranging study , pediatric patients were randomized in equal proportions to 1 of 5 treatment groups : 0 . 05 , 0 . 2 , 0 . 8 , or 3 . 2 mcg / kg / min fenoldopam or placebo .
Fenoldopam or placebo was administered as a blinded continuous IV infusion for 30 minutes .
Following this , open - label titration of fenoldopam was given to induce hypotension or normotension ( defined as MAP , between 50 and 80 mmHg for patients > 1 month of age and MAP between 40 and 70 mmHg for patients ≤ 1 month ) .
Seventy - seven pediatric patients ( up to 12 years of age – Tanner Stages 1 and 2 ) were treated for at least two hours .
Of these , 2 were < 1 month of age , 25 were between 1 month of age and 1 year of age , 7 were between 1 and 2 years of age , and 43 were between 2 and 12 years of age .
Of the 77 patients enrolled in the trial , 58 were enrolled in association with surgery , and 19 were treated in an ICU setting .
The lowest dosage at which decreases in MAP were seen during blinded administration was 0 . 2 mcg / kg / min .
The dose at which the maximum effect was seen was 0 . 8 mcg / kg / min .
Doses higher than 0 . 8 mcg / kg / min generally produced no further decreases in MAP but did worsen tachycardia ( Table 6 ) .
Changes in blood pressure and heart rate occurred as early as 5 minutes after starting infusion .
Doses as high as 4 mcg / kg / min were administered during the open - label period .
The effects increased with time for 15 to 25 minutes , and an effect could still be detected after an average of 4 hours of infusion .
When the infusion was discontinued , blood pressure and heart rates approached baseline values during the following 30 minutes .

12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Adult Patients Fenoldopam , administered as a constant infusion at dosages of 0 . 01 to 1 . 6 mcg / kg / min , produced steady - state plasma concentrations that were proportional to infusion rates .
The elimination half - life was about 5 minutes in mild to moderate hypertensives , with little difference between the R ( active ) and S isomers .
Steady state concentrations are attained in about 20 minutes ( 4 half - lives ) .
The steady state plasma concentrations of fenoldopam , at comparable infusion rates , were similar in normotensive patients and in patients with mild to moderate hypertension or hypertensive emergencies .
The pharmacokinetics of fenoldopam were not influenced by age , gender , or race in adult patients with a hypertensive emergency .
There have been no formal drug - drug interaction studies using intravenous fenoldopam .
Clearance of parent ( active ) fenoldopam is not altered in adult patients with end - stage renal disease on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) and is not altered in adult patients with severe hepatic failure .
The effects of hemodialysis on the pharmacokinetics of fenoldopam have not been evaluated .
Pediatric Patients In children , aged 1 month to 12 years old , steady - state fenoldopam plasma concentrations were proportional to dose ( 0 . 05 mcg / kg / min to 3 . 2 mcg / kg / min ) .
The elimination half - life and clearance were 3 to 5 minutes and 3 L / h / kg , respectively .
In radiolabeled studies in rats , no more than 0 . 005 % of fenoldopam crossed the blood - brain barrier .
Excretion and Metabolism Radiolabeled studies show that about 90 % of infused fenoldopam is eliminated in urine , 10 % in feces .
Elimination is largely by conjugation , without participation of cytochrome P - 450 enzymes .
The principal routes of conjugation are methylation , glucuronidation , and sulfation .
Only 4 % of the administered dose is excreted unchanged .
Animal data indicate that the metabolites are inactive .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a 24 - month study , mice treated orally with fenoldopam at 12 . 5 , 25 , or 50 mg / kg / day , reduced to 25 mg / kg / day on day 209 of study , showed no increase above controls in the incidence of neoplasms .
Female mice in the highest dose group had an increased incidence and degree of severity of a fibro - osseous lesion of the sternum compared with control or low - dose animals .
Compared to controls , female mice in the middle - and upper - dose groups had a higher incidence and degree of severity of chronic nephritis .
These pathologic lesions were not seen in male mice treated with fenoldopam .
In a 24 - month study , rats treated orally with fenoldopam at 5 , 10 or 20 mg / kg / day , with the mid - and high - dose groups increased to 15 or 25 mg / kg / day , respectively , on day 372 of the study , showed no increase above controls in the incidence or type of neoplasms .
Compared with the controls , rats in the mid - and high - dose groups had a higher incidence of hyperplasia of collecting duct epithelium at the tip of the renal papilla .
Fenoldopam did not induce bacterial gene mutation in the Ames test or mammalian gene mutation in the Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell assay .
In the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay with CHO cells , fenoldopam was associated with statistically significant and dose - dependent increases in chromosomal aberrations , and in the proportion of aberrant metaphases .
However , no chromosomal damage was seen in the in vivo mice micronucleus or bone marrow assays .
Oral fertility and general reproduction performance studies in male and female rats at 12 . 5 , 37 . 5 or 75 mg / kg / day revealed no impairment of fertility or reproduction performance due to fenoldopam .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Unusual toxicologic findings ( arterial lesions in the rat ) with fenoldopam are summarized below .
These findings have not been observed in mice or dogs .
No evidence of a similar lesion in humans has been observed .
Arterial lesions characterized by medial necrosis and hemorrhage have been seen in renal and splanchnic arteries of rats given fenoldopam mesylate by continuous intravenous infusion at doses of 1 to 100 mcg / kg / min for 24 hours .
The incidence of these lesions is dose related .
Arterial lesions morphologically identical to those observed with fenoldopam have been reported in rats infused with dopamine .
Data suggest that the mechanism for this injury involves activation of D1 - like dopaminergic receptors .
Such lesions have not been seen in dogs given doses up to 100 mcg / kg / min by continuous intravenous infusion for 24 hours , nor were they seen in dogs infused at the same dose for 6 hours daily for 24 days .
The clinical significance of this finding is not known .
Oral administration of fenoldopam doses of 10 to 15 mg / kg / day or 20 to 25 mg / kg / day to rats for 24 months induced a higher incidence of polyarteritis nodosa compared to controls .
