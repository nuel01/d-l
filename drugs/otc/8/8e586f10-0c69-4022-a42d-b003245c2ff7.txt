DESCRIPTION 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation , USP is a sterile nonpyrogenic , isotonic solution in a single dose ARTHROMATIC plastic container for use as an arthroscopic irrigating solution .
Each liter contains 9 g Sodium Chloride , USP ( NaCl ) in Water for Injection .
pH 5 . 5 ( 4 . 5 to 7 . 0 ) .
Milliequivalents per liter : Sodium - 154 , Chloride - 154 .
Osmolarity 308 mOsmol / L ( calc . )
.
No antimicrobial agent has been added .
The ARTHROMATIC plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinyl chloride ( PL 146 Plastic ) .
The amount of water that can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period , e . g . , di - 2 - ethylhexylphthalate ( DEHP ) , up to 5 parts per million .
However , the safety of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation , USP is useful as an irrigating fluid for body joints because the solution is isotonic , and provides a transparent fluid medium with optical properties suitable for good visualization of the interior joint surface during endoscopic examination .
During arthroscopic surgical procedures , the solution acts as a lavage for removing blood , tissue fragments , and bone fragments .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation , USP is indicated for use as an arthroscopic irrigating fluid with endoscopic instruments during arthroscopic procedures requiring distension and irrigation of the knee , shoulder , elbow , or other bone joints .
CONTRAINDICATIONS None known .
WARNINGS Not for injection .
Because fluids used to irrigate joints may be absorbed into the general circulation , solutions containing sodium ion should be used with great care in patients with congestive heart failure , severe renal insufficiency , and in clinical states in which there exists edema with sodium retention .
The contents of an opened container should be used promptly to minimize the possibility of bacterial growth or pyrogen formation .
Discard the unused portion of irrigating solution since no antimicrobial agent has been added .
PRECAUTIONS Because some of the fluid used to irrigate joints may be absorbed , caution must be exercised in the volume of irrigating fluid used especially with solutions containing the sodium ion in patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Do not administer unless the solution is clear and the seal is intact .
ADVERSE REACTIONS None known .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The volume of solution needed will vary with the nature and duration of the arthroscopic procedure .
If desired , warm in overpouch to near body temperature in a water bath or oven heated to not more than 45º C . Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit .
HOW SUPPLIED 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation , USP in ARTHROMATIC Plastic Container is available as follows : 2B7477 3000 mL NDC 0338 - 0047 - 27 2B7479 5000 mL NDC 0338 - 0047 - 29 Exposure of pharmaceutical products to heat should be minimized .
Avoid excessive heat .
It is recommended the product be stored at room temperature ( 25º C ) ; brief exposure up to 40º C does not adversely affect the product .
DIRECTIONS FOR USE Tear overwrap down side at slit and remove solution container .
Visually inspect the container .
If the outlet port protector is damaged , detached , or not present , discard container as solution path sterility may be impaired .
Some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed .
This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety .
The opacity will diminish gradually .
Check for minute leaks by squeezing bag firmly .
If leaks are found , discard solution as sterility may be impaired .
Use Aseptic Technique .
