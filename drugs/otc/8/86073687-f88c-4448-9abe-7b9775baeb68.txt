EZALLOR Sprinkle capsules : 5 mg , 10 mg , 20 mg , and 40 mg ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS EZALLOR Sprinkle is contraindicated in the following conditions : • Patients with a known hypersensitivity to any component of this product .
Hypersensitivity reactions including rash , pruritus , urticaria , and angioedema have been reported with rosuvastatin [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
• Patients with active liver disease , which may include unexplained persistent elevations of hepatic transaminase levels [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
• Pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .
• Lactation .
Limited data indicate that rosuvastatin is present in human milk .
Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants , women who require EZALLOR Sprinkle treatment should not breastfeed their infants [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 2 ) ] .
• Known hypersensitivity to product components ( 4 ) • Active liver disease , which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels ( 4 ) • Pregnancy ( 4 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) • Lactation ( 4 , 8 . 2 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Skeletal muscle effects ( e . g . , myopathy and rhabdomyolysis ) : Risks increase with use of 40 mg dose , advanced age ( ≥ 65 ) , hypothyroidism , renal impairment , and combination use with cyclosporine , darolutamide , regorafenib , certain anti - viral medicines or their combinations .
Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported .
Advise patients to promptly report to their physician unexplained and / or persistent muscle pain , tenderness , or weakness and discontinue EZALLOR Sprinkle if signs or symptoms appear .
( 5 . 1 , 7 . 4 , 7 . 5 , 7 . 7 , 7 . 8 ) • Immune - Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy ( IMNM ) : There have been rare reports of immune - mediated necrotizing myopathy ( IMNM ) , an autoimmune myopathy , associated with statin use .
IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase , which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment ; positive anti - HMG CoA reductase antibody ; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy ; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents .
( 5 . 2 ) • Liver enzyme abnormalities : Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur .
Perform liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Skeletal Muscle Effects Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors , including rosuvastatin .
These risks can occur at any dose level , but are increased at the highest dose ( 40 mg ) .
EZALLOR Sprinkle should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy ( e . g . , age ≥ 65 years , inadequately treated hypothyroidism , renal impairment ) .
The risk of myopathy during treatment with EZALLOR Sprinkle may be increased with concurrent administration of gemfibrozil , some other lipid - lowering therapies ( other fibrates or niacin ) , cyclosporine , darolutamide , regorafenib , atazanavir / ritonavir , lopinavir / ritonavir , simeprevir or combination of sofosbuvir / velpatasvir / voxilaprevir , dasabuvir / ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , elbasvir / grazoprevir , sofosbuvir / velpatasvir , glecaprevir / pibrentasvir , all combinations with ledipasvir ( including ledipasvir / sofosbuvir ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Cases of myopathy , including rhabdomyolysis , have been reported with HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors , including rosuvastatin , coadministered with colchicine , and caution should be exercised when prescribing EZALLOR Sprinkle with colchicine [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 9 ) ] .
EZALLOR Sprinkle therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated creatine kinase levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected .
EZALLOR Sprinkle therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient with an acute , serious condition suggestive of myopathy or predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis ( e . g . , sepsis , hypotension , dehydration , major surgery , trauma , severe metabolic , endocrine , and electrolyte disorders , or uncontrolled seizures ) .
All patients should be advised to promptly report to their physician unexplained muscle pain , tenderness , or weakness , particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing EZALLOR Sprinkle .
5 . 2 Immune - Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports of immune - mediated necrotizing myopathy ( IMNM ) , an autoimmune myopathy , associated with statin use .
IMNM is characterized by : proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase , which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment ; positive anti - HMG CoA reductase antibody ; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy ; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents .
Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary .
Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required .
Consider risk of IMNM carefully prior to initiation of a different statin .
If therapy is initiated with a different statin , monitor for signs and symptoms of IMNM .
5 . 3 Liver Enzyme Abnormalities It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be performed before the initiation of EZALLOR Sprinkle , and if signs or symptoms of liver injury occur .
Increases in serum transaminases [ AST ( SGOT ) or ALT ( SGPT ) ] have been reported with HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors , including rosuvastatin .
In most cases , the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy .
There were two cases of jaundice , for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined , which resolved after discontinuation of therapy .
There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials .
In a pooled analysis of placebo - controlled trials , increases in serum transaminases to > 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 1 . 1 % of patients taking rosuvastatin versus 0 . 5 % of patients treated with placebo .
There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non - fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins , including rosuvastatin .
If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and / or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with EZALLOR Sprinkle , promptly interrupt therapy .
If an alternate etiology is not found , do not restart EZALLOR Sprinkle .
EZALLOR Sprinkle should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and / or have a history of chronic liver disease [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Active liver disease , which may include unexplained persistent transaminase elevations , is a contraindication to the use of EZALLOR Sprinkle [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
5 . 4 Concomitant Coumarin Anticoagulants Caution should be exercised when anticoagulants are given in conjunction with EZALLOR Sprinkle because of its potentiation of the effect of coumarin - type anticoagulants in prolonging the prothrombin time / INR .
In patients taking coumarin anticoagulants and EZALLOR Sprinkle concomitantly , INR should be determined before starting EZALLOR Sprinkle and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significant alteration of INR occurs [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 6 ) ] .
5 . 5 Proteinuria and Hematuria In the rosuvastatin clinical trial program , dipstick - positive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were observed among rosuvastatin treated patients .
These findings were more frequent in patients taking rosuvastatin 40 mg , when compared to lower doses of rosuvastatin or comparator HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors , though it was generally transient and was not associated with worsening renal function .
Although the clinical significance of this finding is unknown , a dose reduction should be considered for patients on EZALLOR Sprinkle therapy with unexplained persistent proteinuria and / or hematuria during routine urinalysis testing .
5 . 6 Endocrine Effects Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors , including rosuvastatin .
Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin , in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Although clinical studies have shown that rosuvastatin alone does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve , caution should be exercised if EZALLOR Sprinkle is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones such as ketoconazole , spironolactone , and cimetidine .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label : • Rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria and acute renal failure and myopathy ( including myositis ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Liver enzyme abnormalities [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] Most frequent adverse reactions ( rate > 2 % ) are headache , myalgia , abdominal pain , asthenia , and nausea .

In a clinical trial , 17 , 802 participants were treated with rosuvastatin 20 mg ( n = 8 , 901 ) or placebo ( n = 8 , 901 ) for a mean duration of 2 years .
A higher percentage of rosuvastatin - treated patients versus placebo - treated patients , 6 . 6 % and 6 . 2 % , respectively , discontinued study medication due to an adverse event , irrespective of treatment causality .
Myalgia was the most common adverse reaction that led to treatment discontinuation .
There was a significantly higher frequency of diabetes mellitus reported in patients taking rosuvastatin ( 2 . 8 % ) versus patients taking placebo ( 2 . 3 % ) .
Mean HbA1c was significantly increased by 0 . 1 % in rosuvastatin - treated patients compared to placebo - treated patients .
The number of patients with a HbA1c > 6 . 5 % at the end of the trial was significantly higher in rosuvastatin - treated versus placebo - treated patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2 % of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 3 .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of rosuvastatin : arthralgia , fatal and non - fatal hepatic failure , hepatitis , jaundice , thrombocytopenia , depression , sleep disorders ( including insomnia and nightmares ) , peripheral neuropathy , interstitial lung disease and gynecomastia .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
There have been rare reports of immune - mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment ( e . g . , memory loss , forgetfulness , amnesia , memory impairment , and confusion ) associated with statin use .
These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins .
The reports are generally nonserious , and reversible upon statin discontinuation , with variable times to symptom onset ( 1 day to years ) and symptom resolution ( median of 3 weeks ) .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Combination of sofosbuvir / velpatasvir / voxilaprevir or ledipasvir / sofosbuvir : Combination increases rosuvastatin exposure .
Use with EZALLOR Sprinkle is not recommended .
( 2 . 3 , 5 . 1 , 7 . 3 , 12 . 3 ) • Cyclosporine and darolutamide : Combination increases rosuvastatin exposure .
Limit EZALLOR Sprinkle dose to 5 mg once daily .

( 2 . 3 , 5 . 1 , 7 . 3 , 12 . 3 ) • Regorafenib : Combination increases rosuvastatin exposure .
Limit EZALLOR Sprinkle dose to 10 mg once daily .
( 2 . 3 , 5 . 1 , 7 . 5 ) • Coumarin anticoagulants : Combination prolongs INR .
Achieve stable INR prior to starting EZALLOR Sprinkle .
Monitor INR frequently until stable upon initiation or alteration of EZALLOR Sprinkle therapy .
( 5 . 4 , 7 . 6 ) • Concomitant lipid - lowering therapies : Use with fibrates or lipid - modifying doses ( ≥ 1 g / day ) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects .
Caution should be used when prescribing with EZALLOR Sprinkle .
( 5 . 1 , 7 . 7 , 7 . 8 ) 7 . 1 Cyclosporine Cyclosporine increased rosuvastatin exposure and may result in increased risk of myopathy .
Therefore , in patients taking cyclosporine , the dose of EZALLOR Sprinkle should not exceed 5 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Gemfibrozil Gemfibrozil significantly increased rosuvastatin exposure .
Due to an observed increased risk of myopathy / rhabdomyolysis , combination therapy with EZALLOR Sprinkle and gemfibrozil should be avoided .
If used together , the dose of EZALLOR Sprinkle should not exceed 10 mg once daily [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 3 Anti - viral Medications Coadministration of rosuvastatin with certain anti - viral drugs has differing effects on rosuvastatin exposure and may increase risk of myopathy .
The combination of sofosbuvir / velpatasvir / voxilaprevir which are anti - Hepatitis C virus ( anti - HCV ) drugs , increases rosuvastatin exposure .
Similarly , the combination of ledipasvir / sofosbuvir may significantly increase rosuvastatin exposure .
For these combinations of anti - HCV drugs , concomitant use with EZALLOR Sprinkleis not recommended .
Simeprevir and combinations of dasabuvir / ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , elbasvir / grazoprevir , sofosbuvir / velpatasvir and glecaprevir / pibrentasvir which are anti - HCV drugs , increase rosuvastatin exposure .
Combinations of atazanavir / ritonavir and lopinavir / ritonavir , which are anti - HIV - 1 drugs , increase rosuvastatin exposure [ see Table 4 – Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
For these anti - viral drugs , the dose of EZALLOR Sprinkleshould not exceed 10 mg once daily .
The combinations of fosamprenavir / ritonavir or tipranavir / ritonavir , which are anti - HIV - 1 drugs , produce little or no change in rosuvastatin exposure .
No dose adjustment is needed for concomitant use with these combinations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 4 Darolutamide Darolutamide increased rosuvastatin exposure more than 5 fold .
Therefore , in patients taking darolutamide , the dose of EZALLOR Sprinkle should not exceed 5 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 5 Regorafenib Regorafenib increased rosuvastatin exposure and may increase the risk of myopathy .
If used together , the dose of EZALLOR Sprinkle should not exceed 10 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) .
7 . 6 Coumarin Anticoagulants Rosuvastatin significantly increased INR in patients receiving coumarin anticoagulants .
Therefore , caution should be exercised when coumarin anticoagulants are given in conjunction with EZALLOR Sprinkle .
In patients taking coumarin anticoagulants and EZALLOR Sprinkle concomitantly , INR should be determined before starting EZALLOR Sprinkle and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significant alteration of INR occurs [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 7 Niacin The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when EZALLOR Sprinkle is used in combination with lipid - modifying doses ( ≥ 1 g / day ) of niacin ; caution should be used when prescribing with EZALLOR Sprinkle [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
7 . 8 Fenofibrate When rosuvastatin was coadministered with fenofibrate , no clinically significant increase in the AUC of rosuvastatin or fenofibrate was observed .
Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concomitant use of fenofibrates , caution should be used when prescribing fenofibrates with EZALLOR Sprinkle [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 9 Colchicine Cases of myopathy , including rhabdomyolysis , have been reported with HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors , including rosuvastatin , coadministered with colchicine , and caution should be exercised when prescribing EZALLOR Sprinkle with colchicine [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Females of reproductive potential : Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with EZALLOR Sprinkle ( 8 . 3 ) • Severe renal impairment ( not on hemodialysis ) : Starting dose is 5 mg , not to exceed 10 mg .
( 2 . 4 , 5 . 1 , 8 . 6 ) • Asian population : Consider 5 mg starting dose .
( 2 . 2 , 8 . 8 ) Pediatric use information for patients 7 to 17 years of age is approved for AstraZeneca ’ s CRESTOR ( rosuvastatin calcium ) tablets .
However , due to AstraZeneca ’ s marketing exclusivity rights , this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary EZALLOR Sprinkle is contraindicated for use in pregnant women since safety in pregnant women has not been established and there is no apparent benefit to therapy with EZALLOR Sprinkle during pregnancy .
Because HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol , EZALLOR Sprinkle may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women .
EZALLOR Sprinkle should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Limited published data on the use of rosuvastatin are insufficient to determine a drug - associated risk of major congenital malformations or miscarriage .
In animal reproduction studies , there were no adverse developmental effects with oral administration of rosuvastatin during organogenesis at systemic exposures equivalent to a maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 40 mg / day in rats or rabbits ( based on AUC and body surface area , respectively ) .
In rats and rabbits , decreased pup / fetal survival occurred at 12 times and equivalent , respectively , to the MRHD of 40 mg / day [ see Data ] .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data Limited published data on rosuvastatin have not shown an increased risk of major congenital malformations or miscarriage .
Rare reports of congenital anomalies have been received following intrauterine exposure to other statins .
In a review of approximately 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to simvastatin or lovastatin , the incidences of congenital anomalies , spontaneous abortions , and fetal deaths / stillbirths did not exceed what would be expected in the general population .
The number of cases is adequate to exclude a ≥ 3 to 4 - fold increase in congenital anomalies over the background incidence .
In 89 % of the prospectively followed pregnancies , drug treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified .
Animal Data Rosuvastatin crosses the placenta in rats and rabbits and is found in fetal tissue and amniotic fluid at 3 % and 20 % , respectively , of the maternal plasma concentration following a single 25 mg / kg oral gavage dose on gestation day 16 in rats .
A higher fetal tissue distribution ( 25 % maternal plasma concentration ) was observed in rabbits after a single oral gavage dose of 1 mg / kg on gestation day 18 .
Rosuvastatin administration did not indicate a teratogenic effect in rats at ≤ 25 mg / kg / day or in rabbits ≤ 3 mg / kg / day ( doses equivalent to the MRHD of 40 mg / day based on AUC and body surface area , respectively ) .
In female rats given 5 , 15 and 50 mg / kg / day before mating and continuing through to gestation day 7 resulted in decreased fetal body weight ( female pups ) and delayed ossification at 50 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the human exposure at the MRHD dose of 40 mg / day based on AUC ) .
In pregnant rats given 2 , 10 and 50 mg / kg / day of rosuvastatin from gestation day 7 through lactation day 21 ( weaning ) , decreased pup survival occurred at 50 mg / kg / day ( dose equivalent to 12 times the MRHD of 40 mg / day based body surface area ) .
In pregnant rabbits given 0 . 3 , 1 , and 3 mg / kg / day of rosuvastatin from gestation day 6 to day 18 , decreased fetal viability and maternal mortality was observed at 3 mg / kg / day ( dose equivalent to the MRHD of 40 mg / day based on body surface area ) .

11 DESCRIPTION Rosuvastatin calcium is a synthetic lipid - lowering agent for oral administration .
The chemical name for rosuvastatin calcium is bis [ ( E ) - 7 - [ 4 - ( 4 - fluorophenyl ) - 6 - isopropyl - 2 - [ methyl ( methylsulfonyl ) amino ] pyrimidin - 5 - yl ] - ( 3 R , 5 S ) - 3 , 5 - dihydroxyhept - 6 - enoic acid ] calcium salt with the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The molecular formula for rosuvastatin calcium is ( C22H27FN3O6S ) 2 · Ca and the molecular weight is 1 , 001 . 14 .
Rosuvastatin calcium is off - white to light yellow amorphous powder that is slightly soluble in water and methanol , and insoluble in ethanol .
Rosuvastatin calcium is a hydrophilic compound with a partition coefficient ( octanol / water ) of 0 . 13 at pH of 7 .
Each rosuvastatin capsule for oral administration contains 5 mg , 10 mg , 20 mg , or 40 mg of rosuvastatin ( present as 5 . 198 mg , 10 . 395 mg , 20 . 790 mg , or 41 . 580 mg of rosuvastatin calcium ) in the form of granules with the following inactive ingredients : microcrystalline cellulose , crospovidone , mannitol , magnesium oxide , ferric oxide , sodium citrate , hypromellose , polyethylene glycol 4000 , and silicon dioxide .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Rosuvastatin is a selective and competitive inhibitor of HMG - CoA reductase , the rate - limiting enzyme that converts 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl coenzyme A to mevalonate , a precursor of cholesterol .
In vivo studies in animals , and in vitro studies in cultured animal and human cells have shown rosuvastatin to have a high uptake into , and selectivity for , action in the liver , the target organ for cholesterol lowering .
In in vivo and in vitro studies , rosuvastatin produces its lipid - modifying effects in two ways .
First , it increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell - surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL .
Second , rosuvastatin inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL , which reduces the total number of VLDL and LDL particles .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Rosuvastatin dose dependently reduces elevated LDL - cholesterol and reduces total cholesterol and triglycerides and increases HDL - cholesterol [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
A therapeutic response to rosuvastatin is evident within 1 week of commencing therapy and 90 % of maximum response is usually achieved in 2 weeks .
The maximum response is usually achieved by 4 weeks and is maintained after that .
Individualization of drug dosage should be based on the therapeutic response [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In clinical pharmacology studies in man , peak plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were reached 3 to 5 hours following oral dosing .
Both Cmax and AUC increased in approximate proportion to rosuvastatin dose .
The absolute bioavailability of rosuvastatin is approximately 20 % .
Administration of rosuvastatin with food did not affect the AUC of rosuvastatin .
The AUC of rosuvastatin does not differ following evening or morning drug administration .
Distribution Mean volume of distribution at steady - state of rosuvastatin is approximately 134 liters .
Rosuvastatin is 88 % bound to plasma proteins , mostly albumin .
This binding is reversible and independent of plasma concentrations .
Elimination Rosuvastatin is primarily eliminated by excretion in the feces .
The elimination half - life of rosuvastatin is approximately 19 hours .
Metabolism Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolized ; approximately 10 % of a radiolabeled dose is recovered as metabolite .
The major metabolite is N - desmethyl rosuvastatin , which is formed principally by cytochrome P450 \ 2C9 , and in vitro studies have demonstrated that N - desmethyl rosuvastatin has approximately one - sixth to one - half the HMG - CoA reductase inhibitory activity of the parent compound .
Overall , greater than 90 % of active plasma HMG - CoA reductase inhibitory activity is accounted for by the parent compound .
Excretion Following oral administration , rosuvastatin and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the feces ( 90 % ) .
After an intravenous dose , approximately 28 % of total body clearance was via the renal route , and 72 % by the hepatic route .
Specific Populations Racial or Ethnic Groups A population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics among Caucasian , Hispanic , and Black or Afro - Caribbean groups .
However , pharmacokinetic studies , including one conducted in the US , have demonstrated an approximate 2 - fold elevation in median exposure ( AUC and Cmax ) in Asian subjects when compared with a Caucasian control group .
Male and Female Patients There were no differences in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin between men and women .
Geriatric Patients There were no differences in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin between the nonelderly and elderly populations ( age ≥ 65 years ) .
Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr ≥ 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) had no influence on plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin .
However , plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin increased to a clinically significant extent ( about 3 - fold ) in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) not receiving hemodialysis compared with healthy subjects ( CLcr > 80 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) .
Hemodialysis Steady - state plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin in patients on chronic hemodialysis were approximately 50 % greater compared with healthy volunteer subjects with normal renal function .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcohol liver disease , plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were modestly increased .
In patients with Child - Pugh A disease , Cmax and AUC were increased by 60 % and 5 % , respectively , as compared with patients with normal liver function .
In patients with Child - Pugh B disease , Cmax and AUC were increased 100 % and 21 % , respectively , compared with patients with normal liver function .
Drug Interaction Studies Rosuvastatin clearance is not dependent on metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4 to a clinically significant extent .
Rosuvastatin is a substrate for certain transporter proteins including the hepatic uptake organic anion - transporting polyproteins ( OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 ) and efflux transporter breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) .
Concomitant administration of rosuvastatin with medications that are inhibitors of these transporter proteins ( e . g . , cyclosporine , certain HIV protease inhibitors ) may result in increased rosuvastatin plasma concentrations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 , 7 . 3 ) ] .

Higher plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin have been reported in very small groups of patients ( n = 3 to 5 ) who have two reduced function alleles of the gene that encodes OATP1B1 ( SLCO1B1 521 T > C ) .
The frequency of this genotype ( i . e . , SLCO1B1 521 C / C ) is generally lower than 5 % in most racial / ethnic groups .
The impact of this polymorphism on efficacy and / or safety of rosuvastatin has not been clearly established .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a 104 - week carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 2 , 20 , 60 , or 80 mg / kg / day by oral gavage , the incidence of uterine stromal polyps was significantly increased in females at 80 mg / kg / day at systemic exposure 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC .
Increased incidence of polyps was not seen at lower doses .
In a 107 - week carcinogenicity study in mice given 10 , 60 or 200 mg / kg / day by oral gavage , an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenoma / carcinoma was observed at 200 mg / kg / day at systemic exposures 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC .
An increased incidence of hepatocellular tumors was not seen at lower doses .
Rosuvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , the mouse lymphoma assay , and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells .
Rosuvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test .
In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 5 , 15 , 50 mg / kg / day , males were treated for 9 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating and throughout mating until gestation day 7 .
No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 50 mg / kg / day ( systemic exposures up to 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC ) .
In testicles of dogs treated with rosuvastatin at 30 mg / kg / day for one month , spermatidic giant cells were seen .
Spermatidic giant cells were observed in monkeys after 6 - month treatment at 30 mg / kg / day in addition to vacuolation of seminiferous tubular epithelium .
Exposures in the dog were 20 times and in the monkey 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on body surface area .
Similar findings have been seen with other drugs in this class .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Central Nervous System Toxicity CNS vascular lesions , characterized by perivascular hemorrhages , edema , and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces , have been observed in dogs treated with several other members of this drug class .
A chemically similar drug in this class produced dose - dependent optic nerve degeneration ( Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers ) in dogs , at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose .
Edema , hemorrhage , and partial necrosis in the interstitium of the choroid plexus was observed in a female dog sacrificed moribund at day 24 at 90 mg / kg / day by oral gavage ( systemic exposures 100 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC ) .

In the overall population , the mean LDL - C reduction from baseline was 22 % .
About one - third of the patients benefited from increasing their dose from 20 mg to 40 mg with further LDL lowering of greater than 6 % .
In the 27 patients with at least a 15 % reduction in LDL - C , the mean LDL - C reduction was 30 % ( median 28 % reduction ) .
Among 13 patients with an LDL - C reduction of < 15 % , 3 had no change or an increase in LDL - C .
Reductions in LDL - C of 15 % or greater were observed in 3 of 5 patients with known receptor negative status .
