( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Never share a HUMALOG KwikPen , cartridge , reusable pen compatible with Lilly 3 mL cartridges , or syringe between patients , even if the needle is changed .
( 5 . 1 ) • Hyper - or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen : Carry out under close medical supervision and increase frequency of blood glucose monitoring .
( 5 . 2 ) • Hypoglycemia : May be life - threatening .
Monitor blood glucose and increase monitoring frequency with changes to insulin dosage , use of glucose lowering medications , meal pattern , physical activity ; in patients with renal or hepatic impairment ; and in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness .
( 5 . 3 , 7 , 8 . 6 , 8 . 7 ) • Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors : Accidental mix - ups between insulin products can occur .
Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection .
Do not transfer HUMALOG U - 200 from the HUMALOG KwikPen to a syringe as overdosage and severe hypoglycemia can result .
( 5 . 4 ) • Hypersensitivity Reactions : May be life - threatening .
Discontinue HUMALOG , monitor and treat if indicated .
( 5 . 5 ) • Hypokalemia : May be life - threatening .
Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated .
( 5 . 6 ) • Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) : Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure ; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs .
( 5 . 7 ) • Hyperglycemia and Ketoacidosis Due to Insulin Pump Device Malfunction : Monitor glucose and administer HUMALOG U - 100 by subcutaneous injection if pump malfunction occurs .
( 5 . 8 ) 5 . 1 Never Share a HUMALOG KwikPen , Cartridge , Reusable Pen Compatible with Lilly 3 mL Cartridges 1 , or Syringe Between Patients HUMALOG KwikPens , cartridges , and reusable pens compatible with Lilly 3 mL cartridges must never be shared between patients , even if the needle is changed .
Patients using HUMALOG vials must never share needles or syringes with another person .
Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood - borne pathogens .
5 . 2 Hyper - or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in insulin strength , manufacturer , type , or method of administration may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] or hyperglycemia .
These changes should be made cautiously and under close medical supervision and the frequency of blood glucose monitoring should be increased .
5 . 3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins , including HUMALOG .
Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures , may be life - threatening , or cause death .
Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time ; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important ( e . g . , driving or operating other machinery ) .
Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual .
Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes , in patients with diabetic nerve disease , in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system ( e . g . , beta - blockers ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia .
Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and , in general , is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal .
As with all insulin preparations , the glucose lowering effect time course of HUMALOG may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions , including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern ( e . g . , macronutrient content or timing of meals ) , changes in level of physical activity , or changes to co - administered medication [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 , 8 . 7 ) ] .
Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia .
Self - monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia .
In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia , increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended .
5 . 4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix - ups between basal insulin products and other insulins , particularly rapid - acting insulins , have been reported .
To avoid medication errors between HUMALOG and other insulins , instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection .
Do not transfer HUMALOG U - 200 from the HUMALOG KwikPen to a syringe .
The markings on the insulin syringe will not measure the dose correctly and can result in overdosage and severe hypoglycemia [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe , life - threatening , generalized allergy , including anaphylaxis , can occur with insulin products , including HUMALOG .
If hypersensitivity reactions occur , discontinue HUMALOG ; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
HUMALOG is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to HUMALOG or any of its excipients [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
5 . 6 Hypokalemia All insulin products , including HUMALOG , cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space , possibly leading to hypokalemia .
Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis , ventricular arrhythmia , and death .
Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated ( e . g . , patients using potassium - lowering medications , patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations ) .
5 . 7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR - gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) , which are peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor ( PPAR ) - gamma agonists , can cause dose - related fluid retention , particularly when used in combination with insulin .
Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure .
Patients treated with insulin , including HUMALOG , and a PPAR - gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure .
If heart failure develops , it should be managed according to current standards of care , and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR - gamma agonist must be considered .
5 . 8 Hyperglycemia and Ketoacidosis Due to Insulin Pump Device Malfunction Malfunction of the insulin pump or insulin infusion set or insulin degradation can rapidly lead to hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis .
Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis is necessary .
Interim subcutaneous injections with HUMALOG may be required .
Patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure [ see How Supplied / Storage and Handling ( 16 . 2 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 . 7 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions associated with HUMALOG include hypoglycemia , allergic reactions , injection site reactions , lipodystrophy , pruritus , and rash .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1 - 800 - LillyRx ( 1 - 800 - 545 - 5979 ) or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
Observed with HUMALOG U - 100 The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere : • Hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
• Hypokalemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs , the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared with those rates reported in another clinical trial , and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice .
The frequencies of Treatment - Emergent Adverse Events during HUMALOG clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below .
Table 1 : Treatment - Emergent Adverse Events in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( adverse events with frequency ≥ 5 % ) Events , n ( % ) Lispro ( n = 81 ) Regular human insulin ( n = 86 ) Flu syndrome 28 ( 34 . 6 ) 28 ( 32 . 6 ) Pharyngitis 27 ( 33 . 3 ) 29 ( 33 . 7 ) Rhinitis 20 ( 24 . 7 ) 25 ( 29 . 1 ) Headache 24 ( 29 . 6 ) 19 ( 22 . 1 ) Pain 16 ( 19 . 8 ) 14 ( 16 . 3 ) Cough increased 14 ( 17 . 3 ) 15 ( 17 . 4 ) Infection 11 ( 13 . 6 ) 18 ( 20 . 9 ) Nausea 5 ( 6 . 2 ) 13 ( 15 . 1 ) Accidental injury 7 ( 8 . 6 ) 10 ( 11 . 6 ) Surgical procedure 5 ( 6 . 2 ) 12 ( 14 . 0 ) Fever 5 ( 6 . 2 ) 10 ( 11 . 6 ) Abdominal pain 6 ( 7 . 4 ) 7 ( 8 . 1 ) Asthenia 6 ( 7 . 4 ) 7 ( 8 . 1 ) Bronchitis 6 ( 7 . 4 ) 6 ( 7 . 0 ) Diarrhea 7 ( 8 . 6 ) 5 ( 5 . 8 ) Dysmenorrhea 5 ( 6 . 2 ) 6 ( 7 . 0 ) Myalgia 6 ( 7 . 4 ) 5 ( 5 . 8 ) Urinary tract infection 5 ( 6 . 2 ) 4 ( 4 . 7 ) Table 2 : Treatment - Emergent Adverse Events in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( adverse events with frequency ≥ 5 % ) Events , n ( % ) Lispro ( n = 714 ) Regular human insulin ( n = 709 ) Headache 83 ( 11 . 6 ) 66 ( 9 . 3 ) Pain 77 ( 10 . 8 ) 71 ( 10 . 0 ) Infection 72 ( 10 . 1 ) 54 ( 7 . 6 ) Pharyngitis 47 ( 6 . 6 ) 58 ( 8 . 2 ) Rhinitis 58 ( 8 . 1 ) 47 ( 6 . 6 ) Flu syndrome 44 ( 6 . 2 ) 58 ( 8 . 2 ) Surgical procedure 53 ( 7 . 4 ) 48 ( 6 . 8 ) Insulin initiation and intensification of glucose control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory , reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder , worsening of diabetic retinopathy , and acute painful peripheral neuropathy .
However , long - term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy .
Lipodystrophy Long - term use of insulin , including HUMALOG , can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections or infusion .
Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy ( thickening of adipose tissue ) and lipoatrophy ( thinning of adipose tissue ) , and may affect insulin absorption .
Rotate insulin injection or infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Weight gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy , including HUMALOG , and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria .
Peripheral Edema Insulin , including HUMALOG , may cause sodium retention and edema , particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy .
Adverse Reactions with Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion ( CSII ) — HUMALOG U - 100 In a 12 - week , randomized , crossover study in adult patients with type 1 diabetes ( n = 39 ) , the rates of catheter occlusions and infusion site reactions were similar for HUMALOG U - 100 and regular human insulin treated patients ( see Table 3 ) .
Table 3 : Catheter Occlusions and Infusion Site Reactions HUMALOG U - 100 ( n = 38 ) Regular human insulin ( n = 39 ) Catheter occlusions / month 0 . 09 0 . 10 Infusion site reactions 2 . 6 % ( 1 / 38 ) 2 . 6 % ( 1 / 39 ) In a randomized , 16 - week , open - label , parallel design study of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes , adverse event reports related to infusion - site reactions were similar for insulin lispro and insulin aspart ( 21 % of 100 patients versus 17 % of 198 patients , respectively ) .
In both groups , the most frequently reported infusion site adverse events were infusion site erythema and infusion site reaction .
Allergic Reactions Local Allergy — As with any insulin therapy , patients taking HUMALOG may experience redness , swelling , or itching at the site of the injection .
These minor reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks , but in some occasions , may require discontinuation of HUMALOG .
In some instances , these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin , such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique .
Systemic Allergy — Severe , life - threatening , generalized allergy , including anaphylaxis , may occur with any insulin , including HUMALOG .
Generalized allergy to insulin may cause whole body rash ( including pruritus ) , dyspnea , wheezing , hypotension , tachycardia , or diaphoresis .
In controlled clinical trials , pruritus ( with or without rash ) was seen in 17 patients receiving regular human insulin ( n = 2969 ) and 30 patients receiving HUMALOG ( n = 2944 ) .
Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with injected metacresol , which is an excipient in HUMALOG [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Antibody Production In large clinical trials with patients with type 1 ( n = 509 ) and type 2 ( n = 262 ) diabetes mellitus , anti - insulin antibody ( insulin lispro - specific antibodies , insulin - specific antibodies , cross - reactive antibodies ) formation was evaluated in patients receiving both regular human insulin and HUMALOG ( including patients previously treated with human insulin and naive patients ) .
As expected , the largest increase in the antibody levels occurred in patients new to insulin therapy .
The antibody levels peaked by 12 months and declined over the remaining years of the study .
These antibodies do not appear to cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate an increase in insulin dose .
There was no statistically significant relationship between the change in the total daily insulin dose and the change in percent antibody binding for any of the antibody types .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience HUMALOG U - 100 The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of HUMALOG .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Medication errors in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for HUMALOG have been identified during postapproval use [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 . 4 ) ] .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Drugs that Affect Glucose Metabolism : Adjustment of insulin dosage may be needed .
( 7 . 1 , 7 . 2 , 7 . 3 ) • Anti - Adrenergic Drugs ( e . g . , beta - blockers , clonidine , guanethidine , and reserpine ) : Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent .
( 5 . 3 , 7 . 4 ) 7 . 1 Drugs That May Increase the Risk of Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia associated with HUMALOG use may be increased when co - administered with antidiabetic agents , salicylates , sulfonamide antibiotics , monoamine oxidase inhibitors , fluoxetine , pramlintide , disopyramide , fibrates , propoxyphene , pentoxifylline , ACE inhibitors , angiotensin II receptor blocking agents , and somatostatin analogs ( e . g . , octreotide ) .
Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when HUMALOG is co - administered with these drugs .
7 . 2 Drugs That May Decrease the Blood Glucose Lowering Effect of HUMALOG The glucose lowering effect of HUMALOG may be decreased when co - administered with corticosteroids , isoniazid , niacin , estrogens , oral contraceptives , phenothiazines , danazol , diuretics , sympathomimetic agents ( e . g . , epinephrine , albuterol , terbutaline ) , somatropin , atypical antipsychotics , glucagon , protease inhibitors , and thyroid hormones .
Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when HUMALOG is co - administered with these drugs .
7 . 3 Drugs That May Increase or Decrease the Blood Glucose Lowering Effect of HUMALOG The glucose lowering effect of HUMALOG may be increased or decreased with co - administered with beta - blockers , clonidine , lithium salts , and alcohol .
Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia , which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia .
Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when HUMALOG is co - administered with these drugs .
7 . 4 Drugs That May Blunt Signs and Symptoms of Hypoglycemia The signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] may be blunted when beta - blockers , clonidine , guanethidine , and reserpine are co - administered with HUMALOG .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatrics : Not studied in children with type 2 diabetes or in children with type 1 diabetes < 3 years of age .
( 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B . All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects , loss , or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure .
This background risk is increased in pregnancies complicated by hyperglycemia and may be decreased with good metabolic control .
It is essential for patients with diabetes or history of gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control before conception and throughout pregnancy .
In patients with diabetes or gestational diabetes insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester , generally increase during the second and third trimesters , and rapidly decline after delivery .
Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential in these patients .
Therefore , female patients should be advised to tell their physicians if they intend to become , or if they become pregnant while taking HUMALOG .
Although there are limited clinical studies of the use of HUMALOG in pregnancy , published studies with human insulins suggest that optimizing overall glycemic control , including postprandial control , before conception and during pregnancy improves fetal outcome .
In a combined fertility and embryo - fetal development study , female rats were given subcutaneous insulin lispro injections of 5 and 20 units / kg / day ( 0 . 8 and 3 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit / kg / day , based on units / body surface area , respectively ) from 2 weeks prior to cohabitation through Gestation Day 19 .
There were no adverse effects on female fertility , implantation , or fetal viability and morphology .
However , fetal growth retardation was produced at the 20 units / kg / day - dose as indicated by decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of fetal runts / litter .
In an embryo - fetal development study in pregnant rabbits , insulin lispro doses of 0 . 1 , 0 . 25 , and 0 . 75 unit / kg / day ( 0 . 03 , 0 . 08 , and 0 . 24 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit / kg / day , based on units / body surface area , respectively ) were injected subcutaneously on Gestation days 7 through 19 .
There were no adverse effects on fetal viability , weight , and morphology at any dose .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is unknown whether insulin lispro is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when HUMALOG is administered to a nursing woman .
Use of HUMALOG is compatible with breastfeeding , but women with diabetes who are lactating may require adjustments of their insulin doses .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use HUMALOG is approved for use in children for subcutaneous daily injections [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Only the U - 100 formulation of HUMALOG is approved for use in children by continuous subcutaneous infusion in insulin pumps .
HUMALOG has not been studied in pediatric patients younger than 3 years of age .
HUMALOG has not been studied in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes .
As in adults , the dosage of HUMALOG must be individualized in pediatric patients based on metabolic needs and results of frequent monitoring of blood glucose .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects ( n = 2834 ) in eight clinical studies of HUMALOG , twelve percent ( n = 338 ) were 65 years of age or over .
The majority of these had type 2 diabetes .
HbA 1 c values and hypoglycemia rates did not differ by age .
Pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic studies to assess the effect of age on the onset of HUMALOG action have not been performed .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent HUMALOG dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent HUMALOG dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Excess insulin administration may cause hypoglycemia and hypokalemia .
Mild episodes of hypoglycemia usually can be treated with oral glucose .
Adjustments in drug dosage , meal patterns , or exercise may be needed .
More severe episodes with coma , seizure , or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular / subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose .
Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery .
Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately .
11 DESCRIPTION HUMALOG ® ( insulin lispro injection ) is a rapid - acting human insulin analog used to lower blood glucose .
Insulin lispro is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non - pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli .
Insulin lispro differs from human insulin in that the amino acid proline at position B28 is replaced by lysine and the lysine in position B29 is replaced by proline .
Chemically , it is Lys ( B28 ) , Pro ( B29 ) human insulin analog and has the empirical formula C 257 H 383 N 65 O 77 S 6 and a molecular weight of 5808 , both identical to that of human insulin .
HUMALOG has the following primary structure : HUMALOG is a sterile , aqueous , clear , and colorless solution .
Each milliliter of HUMALOG U - 100 contains insulin lispro 100 units , 16 mg glycerin , 1 . 88 mg dibasic sodium phosphate , 3 . 15 mg Metacresol , zinc oxide content adjusted to provide 0 . 0197 mg zinc ion , trace amounts of phenol , and Water for Injection .
Insulin lispro has a pH of 7 . 0 to 7 . 8 .
The pH is adjusted by addition of aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid 10 % and / or sodium hydroxide 10 % .
Each milliliter of HUMALOG U - 200 contains insulin lispro 200 units , 16 mg glycerin , 5 mg tromethamine , 3 . 15 mg Metacresol , zinc oxide content adjusted to provide 0 . 046 mg zinc ion , trace amounts of phenol , and Water for Injection .
Insulin lispro has a pH of 7 . 0 to 7 . 8 .
The pH is adjusted by addition of aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid 10 % and / or sodium hydroxide 10 % .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Regulation of glucose metabolism is the primary activity of insulins and insulin analogs , including insulin lispro .
Insulins lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and fat , and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production .
Insulins inhibit lipolysis and proteolysis , and enhance protein synthesis .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics HUMALOG has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis .
One unit of HUMALOG has the same glucose - lowering effect as one unit of regular human insulin .
Studies in normal volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that HUMALOG has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of activity than regular human insulin when given subcutaneously .
The time course of action of insulin and insulin analogs , such as HUMALOG , may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same individual .
The parameters of HUMALOG activity ( time of onset , peak time , and duration ) as designated in Figure 1 should be considered only as general guidelines .
The rate of insulin absorption , and consequently the onset of activity are known to be affected by the site of injection , exercise , and other variables [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
a Baseline insulin concentration was maintained by infusion of 0 . 2 mU / min / kg human insulin .
Intravenous Administration of HUMALOG U - 100 — The glucose lowering effect of intravenously administered HUMALOG was tested in 21 patients with type 1 diabetes .
For the study , the patients ' usual doses of insulin were held and blood glucose concentrations were allowed to reach a stable range of 200 to 260 mg / dL during a one to three hours run - in phase .
The run - in phase was followed by a 6 - hour assessment phase .
During the assessment phase , patients received intravenous HUMALOG at an initial infusion rate of 0 . 5 units / hour .
The infusion rate of HUMALOG could be adjusted at regular timed intervals to achieve and maintain blood glucose concentrations between 100 to 160 mg / dL .
The mean blood glucose levels during the assessment phase for patients on HUMALOG therapy are summarized below in Table 4 .
All patients achieved the targeted glucose range at some point during the 6 - hour assessment phase .
At the endpoint , blood glucose was within the target range ( 100 to 160 mg / dL ) for 17 of 20 patients treated with HUMALOG .
The average time ( ± SE ) required to attain near normoglycemia was 129 ± 14 minutes for HUMALOG .
Table 4 : Mean Blood Glucose Concentrations ( mg / dL ) During Intravenous Infusions of HUMALOG U - 100 a Results shown as mean ± SD Time from Start of Infusion ( minutes ) Mean Blood Glucose ( mg / dL ) Intravenous a 0 224 ± 16 30 205 ± 21 60 195 ± 20 120 165 ± 26 180 140 ± 26 240 123 ± 20 300 120 ± 27 360 122 ± 25 The pharmacodynamics of a single 20 unit dose of HUMALOG U - 200 administered subcutaneously were compared to the pharmacodynamics of a single 20 unit dose of HUMALOG U - 100 administered subcutaneously in a euglycemic clamp study enrolling healthy subjects .
In this study , the overall , maximum , and time to maximum glucose lowering effect were similar between HUMALOG U - 200 and HUMALOG U - 100 .
The mean area under the glucose infusion rate curves ( measure of overall pharmacodynamic effect ) were 125 g and 126 g for HUMALOG U - 200 and HUMALOG U - 100 , respectively .
The maximum glucose infusion rate was 534 mg / min and 559 mg / min and the corresponding median time ( min , max ) to maximum effect were 2 . 8 h ( 0 . 5 h – 6 . 3 h ) and 2 . 4 h ( 0 . 5 h – 4 . 7 h ) for HUMALOG U - 200 and HUMALOG U - 100 , respectively .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Bioavailability — Studies in healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that HUMALOG is absorbed more quickly than regular human insulin .
In healthy volunteers given subcutaneous doses of HUMALOG ranging from 0 . 1 to 0 . 4 unit / kg , peak serum levels were seen 30 to 90 minutes after dosing .
When healthy volunteers received equivalent doses of regular human insulin , peak insulin levels occurred between 50 to 120 minutes after dosing .
Similar results were seen in patients with type 1 diabetes ( see Figure 2 ) .
a Baseline insulin concentration was maintained by infusion of 0 . 2 mU / min / kg human insulin .
HUMALOG U - 100 was absorbed at a consistently faster rate than regular human insulin in healthy male volunteers given 0 . 2 unit / kg at abdominal , deltoid , or femoral subcutaneous sites .
After HUMALOG was administered in the abdomen , serum drug levels were higher and the duration of action was slightly shorter than after deltoid or thigh administration .
Bioavailability of HUMALOG is similar to that of regular human insulin .
The absolute bioavailability after subcutaneous injection ranges from 55 % to 77 % with doses between 0 . 1 to 0 . 2 unit / kg , inclusive .
The results of a study in healthy subjects demonstrated that HUMALOG U - 200 is bioequivalent to HUMALOG U - 100 following administration of a single 20 unit dose .
The mean observed area under the serum insulin concentration - time curve from time zero to infinity was 2360 pmol hr / L and 2390 pmol hr / L for HUMALOG U - 200 and HUMALOG U - 100 , respectively .
The corresponding mean peak serum insulin concentration was 795 pmol / L and 909 pmol / L for HUMALOG U - 200 and HUMALOG U - 100 , respectively .
The median time to maximum concentration was 1 . 0 hour for both formulations .
Distribution — When administered intravenously as bolus injections of 0 . 1 and 0 . 2 U / kg dose in two separate groups of healthy subjects , the mean volume of distribution of HUMALOG appeared to decrease with increase in dose ( 1 . 55 and 0 . 72 L / kg , respectively ) in contrast to that of regular human insulin for which , the volume of distribution was comparable across the two dose groups ( 1 . 37 and 1 . 12 L / kg for 0 . 1 and 0 . 2 U / kg dose , respectively ) .
Metabolism — Human metabolism studies have not been conducted .
However , animal studies indicate that the metabolism of HUMALOG is identical to that of regular human insulin .
Elimination — After subcutaneous administration of HUMALOG , the t 1 / 2 is shorter than that of regular human insulin ( 1 versus 1 . 5 hours , respectively ) .
When administered intravenously , HUMALOG and regular human insulin demonstrated similar dose - dependent clearance , with a mean clearance of 21 . 0 mL / min / kg and 21 . 4 mL / min / kg , respectively ( 0 . 1 unit / kg dose ) , and 9 . 6 mL / min / kg and 9 . 4 mL / min / kg , respectively ( 0 . 2 unit / kg dose ) .
Accordingly , HUMALOG demonstrated a mean t 1 / 2 of 0 . 85 hours ( 51 minutes ) and 0 . 92 hours ( 55 minutes ) , respectively for 0 . 1 unit / kg and 0 . 2 unit / kg doses , and regular human insulin mean t 1 / 2 was 0 . 79 hours ( 47 minutes ) and 1 . 28 hours ( 77 minutes ) , respectively for 0 . 1 unit / kg and 0 . 2 unit / kg doses .
Specific Populations The effects of age , gender , race , obesity , pregnancy , or smoking on the pharmacokinetics of HUMALOG have not been studied .
Renal Impairment — Type 2 diabetic patients with varying degree of renal impairment showed no difference in pharmacokinetics of regular insulin and HUMALOG .
However , the sensitivity of the patients to insulin did change , with an increased response to insulin as the renal function declined .
Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with renal impairment .
Careful glucose monitoring and dose adjustments of insulin , including HUMALOG , may be necessary in patients with renal dysfunction .
Hepatic Impairment — Type 2 diabetic patients with impaired hepatic function showed no effect on the pharmacokinetics of HUMALOG as compared to patients with no hepatic dysfunction .
However , some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with liver failure .
Careful glucose monitoring and dose adjustments of insulin , including HUMALOG , may be necessary in patients with hepatic dysfunction .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Standard 2 - year carcinogenicity studies in animals have not been performed .
In Fischer 344 rats , a 12 - month repeat - dose toxicity study was conducted with insulin lispro at subcutaneous doses of 20 and 200 units / kg / day ( approximately 3 and 32 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit / kg / day , based on units / body surface area ) .
Insulin lispro did not produce important target organ toxicity including mammary tumors at any dose .
Insulin lispro was not mutagenic in the following genetic toxicity assays : bacterial mutation , unscheduled DNA synthesis , mouse lymphoma , chromosomal aberration and micronucleus assays .
Male fertility was not compromised when male rats given subcutaneous insulin lispro injections of 5 and 20 units / kg / day ( 0 . 8 and 3 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit / kg / day , based on units / body surface area ) for 6 months were mated with untreated female rats .
In a combined fertility , perinatal , and postnatal study in male and female rats given 1 , 5 , and 20 units / kg / day subcutaneously ( 0 . 16 , 0 . 8 , and 3 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit / kg / day , based on units / body surface area ) , mating and fertility were not adversely affected in either gender at any dose .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology In standard biological assays in fasted rabbits , 0 . 2 unit / kg of insulin lispro injected subcutaneously had the same glucose - lowering effect and had a more rapid onset of action as 0 . 2 unit / kg of regular human insulin .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of HUMALOG U - 100 were studied in children , adolescent , and adult patients with type 1 diabetes ( n = 789 ) and adult patients with type 2 diabetes ( n = 722 ) .
14 . 1 Type 1 Diabetes – Adults and Adolescents A 12 - month , randomized , parallel , open - label , active - controlled study was conducted in patients with type 1 diabetes to assess the safety and efficacy of HUMALOG ( n = 81 ) compared with Humulin ® R [ insulin human injection ( 100 units per mL ) ] ( n = 86 ) .
HUMALOG was administered by subcutaneous injection immediately prior to meals and Humulin R was administered 30 to 45 minutes before meals .
Humulin ® U [ ULTRALENTE ® human insulin ( rDNA origin ) extended zinc suspension ] was administered once or twice daily as the basal insulin .
There was a 2 - to 4 - week run - in period with Humulin R and Humulin U before randomization .
Most patients were Caucasian ( 97 % ) .
Forty - seven percent of the patients were male .
The mean age was 31 years ( range 12 to 70 years ) .
Glycemic control , the total daily doses of HUMALOG and Humulin R , and the incidence of severe hypoglycemia ( as determined by the number of events that were not self - treated ) were similar in the two treatment groups .
There were no episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis in either treatment group .
Table 5 : Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus – Adults and Adolescents a Values are Mean ± SD b Severe hypoglycemia refers to hypoglycemia for which patients were not able to self - treat .

HUMALOG was administered by subcutaneous injection immediately before meals and Humulin R was administered 30 to 45 minutes before meals .
Humulin ® N [ NPH human insulin ( rDNA origin ) isophane suspension ] or Humulin U was administered once or twice daily as the basal insulin .
All patients participated in a 2 - to 4 - week run - in period with Humulin R and Humulin N or Humulin U . Most of the patients were Caucasian ( 88 % ) , and the numbers of men and women in each group were approximately equal .
The mean age was 58 . 6 years ( range 23 . 8 to 85 years ) .
The average body mass index ( BMI ) was 28 . 2 kg / m 2 .
During the study , the majority of patients used Humulin N ( 84 % ) compared with Humulin U ( 16 % ) as their basal insulin .
The reductions from baseline in HbA 1 c and the incidence of severe hypoglycemia ( as determined by the number of events that were not self - treated ) were similar between the two treatments from the combined groups ( see Table 6 ) .
Table 6 : Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus — Adults a Values are Mean ± SD b Severe hypoglycemia refers to hypoglycemia for which patients were not able to self - treat .

One study involved 39 patients , ages 19 to 58 years , treated for 24 weeks with HUMALOG or regular human insulin .
After 12 weeks of treatment , the mean HbA 1 c values decreased from 7 . 8 % to 7 . 2 % in the HUMALOG - treated patients and from 7 . 8 % to 7 . 5 % in the regular human insulin - treated patients .
Another study involved 60 patients ( mean age 39 , range 15 to 58 years ) treated for 24 weeks with either HUMALOG or buffered regular human insulin .
After 12 weeks of treatment , the mean HbA 1 c values decreased from 7 . 7 % to 7 . 4 % in the HUMALOG - treated patients and remained unchanged from 7 . 7 % in the buffered regular human insulin - treated patients .
Rates of hypoglycemia were comparable between treatment groups in both studies .
14 . 5 Type 1 Diabetes – Pediatric Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion A randomized , 16 - week , open - label , parallel design , study of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes ( n = 298 ) aged 4 to 18 years compared two subcutaneous infusion regimens administered via an external insulin pump : insulin aspart ( n = 198 ) or HUMALOG U - 100 ( n = 100 ) .
These two treatments resulted in comparable changes from baseline in HbA 1 c and comparable rates of hypoglycemia after 16 weeks of treatment ( see Table 8 ) .
Infusion site reactions were similar between groups .

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA - approved patient labeling ( Patient Information and Instructions for Use ) .
17 . 1 Never Share a HUMALOG KwikPen , Cartridge , Reusable Pen Compatible with Lilly 3 mL Cartridges , or Syringe Between Patients Advise patients that they must never share a HUMALOG KwikPen , cartridge , or reusable pen compatible with Lilly 3 mL cartridges with another person , even if the needle is changed .
Advise patients using HUMALOG vials not to share needles or syringes with another person .
Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood - borne pathogens .
17 . 2 Hypoglycemia Instruct patients on self - management procedures including glucose monitoring , proper injection technique , and management of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia , especially at initiation of HUMALOG therapy .
Instruct patients on handling of special situations such as intercurrent conditions ( illness , stress , or emotional disturbances ) , an inadequate or skipped insulin dose , inadvertent administration of an increased insulin dose , inadequate food intake , and skipped meals .
Instruct patients on the management of hypoglycemia .
Inform patients that their ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia .
Advise patients who have frequent hypoglycemia or reduced or absent warning signs of hypoglycemia to use caution when driving or operating machinery [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
17 . 3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Advise patients that hypersensitivity reactions have occurred with HUMALOG .
Inform patients on the symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
17 . 4 Medication Errors Instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix - ups between insulin products .
Inform patients that HUMALOG U - 200 contains 2 times as much insulin in 1 mL as HUMALOG U - 100 .
Inform patients that the HUMALOG U - 200 KwikPen dose window shows the number of units of HUMALOG U - 200 to be injected and that no dose conversion is required .
Instruct patients to NOT transfer HUMALOG U - 200 from the HUMALOG KwikPen to a syringe .
The markings on the syringe will not measure the dose correctly and this can result in overdosage and severe hypoglycemia .
17 . 5 Administration Instruction for HUMALOG U - 200 Instruct patients to NOT mix HUMALOG U - 200 with any other insulin .
17 . 6 Women of Reproductive Potential Advise females of reproductive potential with diabetes to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or are contemplating pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
17 . 7 Instructions For Patients Using Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Pumps Patients using external pump infusion therapy should be trained appropriately .
The following insulin pumps have been tested in HUMALOG clinical trials conducted by Eli Lilly and Company .
• Disetronic ® H - Tron ® plus V100 , D - Tron ® and D - Tronplus ® with Disetronic Rapid infusion sets 2 • MiniMed ® Models 506 , 507 and 508 and Polyfin ® infusion sets 3 HUMALOG is recommended for use in pump systems suitable for insulin infusion such as MiniMed , Disetronic , and other equivalent pumps .
Before using HUMALOG in a pump system , read the pump label to make sure the pump is indicated for continuous delivery of fast - acting insulin .
HUMALOG is recommended for use in any reservoir and infusion sets that are compatible with insulin and the specific pump .
Please see recommended reservoir and infusion sets in the pump manual .
Do not use HUMALOG U - 200 in an external insulin pump .
To avoid insulin degradation , infusion set occlusion , and loss of the preservative ( metacresol ) , insulin in the reservoir should be replaced at least every 7 days ; infusion sets and infusion set insertion sites should be changed at least every 3 days .
Insulin exposed to temperatures higher than 98 . 6 ° F ( 37 ° C ) should be discarded .
The temperature of the insulin may exceed ambient temperature when the pump housing , cover , tubing or sport case is exposed to sunlight or radiant heat .
Infusion sites that are erythematous , pruritic , or thickened should be reported to the healthcare professional , and a new site selected because continued infusion may increase the skin reaction or alter the absorption of HUMALOG .
Pump or infusion set malfunctions or insulin degradation can lead to rapid hyperglycemia and ketosis .
This is especially pertinent for rapid acting insulin analogs that are more rapidly absorbed through skin and have a shorter duration of action .
Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis is necessary .
Problems include pump malfunction , infusion set occlusion , leakage , disconnection or kinking , and degraded insulin .
Less commonly , hypoglycemia from pump malfunction may occur .
If these problems cannot be promptly corrected , patients should resume therapy with subcutaneous insulin injection and contact their healthcare professionals [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and How Supplied / Storage and Handling ( 16 . 2 ) ] .
