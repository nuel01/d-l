Promethazine hydrochloride is a racemic compound ; the molecular formula is C17H20N2S • HCl and its molecular weight is 320 . 89 .
Promethazine hydrochloride , a phenothiazine derivative , is chemically designated as 10 - [ 2 - ( Dimethylamino ) propyl ] phenothiazine monohydrochloride .
Its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Promethazine hydrochloride occurs as a white to faint yellow , practically odorless , crystalline powder which slowly oxidizes and turns blue on prolonged exposure to air .
It is freely soluble in water and soluble in alcohol .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivative which differs structurally from the antipsychotic phenothiazines by the presence of a branched side chain and no ring substitution .
It is thought that this configuration is responsible for its relative lack ( 1 / 10 that of chlorpromazine ) of dopaminergic Central Nervous System ( CNS ) action .
Promethazine is an H1 receptor blocking agent .
In addition to its antihistaminic action , it provides clinically useful sedative and antiemetic effects .
In therapeutic dosage , promethazine produces no significant effects on the cardiovascular system .
Promethazine is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract .
Clinical effects are apparent within 20 minutes after oral administration and generally last four to six hours , although they may persist as long as 12 hours .
Promethazine is metabolized by the liver to a variety of compounds ; the sulfoxides of promethazine and N - demethylpromethazine are the predominant metabolites appearing in the urine .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Promethazine is useful for : Perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis .
Vasomotor rhinitis .
Allergic conjunctivitis due to inhalant allergens and foods .
Mild , uncomplicated allergic skin manifestations of urticaria and angioedema .
Amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma .
Dermographism .
Anaphylactic reactions , as adjunctive therapy to epinephrine and other standard measures , after the acute manifestations have been controlled .
Preoperative , postoperative , or obstetric sedation .
Prevention and control of nausea and vomiting associated with certain types of anesthesia and surgery .
Therapy adjunctive to meperidine or other analgesics for control of postoperative pain .
Sedation in both children and adults , as well as relief of apprehension and production of light sleep from which the patient can be easily aroused .
Active and prophylactic treatment of motion sickness .
Antiemetic therapy in postoperative patients .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Promethazine products are contraindicated for use in pediatric patients less than two years of age .
Promethazine is contraindicated in individuals known to be hypersensitive or to have had an idiosyncratic reaction to promethazine or to other phenothiazines .
Antihistamines are contraindicated for use in the treatment of lower respiratory tract symptoms , including asthma .
WARNINGS PROMETHAZINE SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS LESS THAN 2 YEARS OF AGE BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR FATAL RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION .
POSTMARKETING CASES OF RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION , INCLUDING FATALITIES , HAVE BEEN REPORTED WITH USE OF PROMETHAZINE IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS LESS THAN 2 YEARS OF AGE .
A WIDE RANGE OF WEIGHT - BASED DOSES OF PROMETHAZINE HAVE RESULTED IN RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION IN THESE PATIENTS .
CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN ADMINISTERING PROMETHAZINE TO PEDIATRIC PATIENTS 2 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER .
IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE LOWEST EFFECTIVE DOSE OF PROMETHAZINE BE USED IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS 2 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER AND CONCOMITANT ADMINISTRATION OF OTHER DRUGS WITH RESPIRATORY DEPRESSANT EFFECTS BE AVOIDED .
Promethazine may cause marked drowsiness .
Ambulatory patients should be cautioned against such activities as driving or operating dangerous machinery until it is known that they do not become drowsy or dizzy from promethazine therapy .
The sedative action of promethazine hydrochloride is additive to the sedative effects of CNS depressants ; therefore , agents such as alcohol , narcotic analgesics , sedatives , hypnotics and tranquilizers should either be eliminated or given in reduced dosage in the presence of promethazine hydrochloride .
When given concomitantly with promethazine hydrochloride , the dose of barbiturates should be reduced by at least one - half , and the dose of analgesic depressants , such as morphine or meperidine , should be reduced by one - quarter to one - half .
Promethazine may lower seizure threshold .
This should be taken into consideration when administering to persons with known seizure disorders , or when giving in combination with narcotics or local anesthetics which may also affect seizure threshold .
Sedative drugs or CNS depressants should be avoided in patients with a history of sleep apnea .
Antihistamines should be used with caution in patients with narrow - angle glaucoma , stenosing peptic ulcer , pyloroduodenal obstruction and urinary bladder obstruction due to symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy and narrowing of the bladder neck .
Administration of promethazine has been associated with reported cholestatic jaundice .
Use in Pediatric Patients PROMETHAZINE PRODUCTS ARE CONTRAINDICATED FOR USE IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS LESS THAN TWO YEARS OF AGE .
CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED WHEN ADMINISTERING PROMETHAZINE PRODUCTS TO PEDIATRIC PATIENTS 2 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR FATAL RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION .
RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AND APNEA , SOMETIMES ASSOCIATED WITH DEATH , ARE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH PROMETHAZINE PRODUCTS AND ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO INDIVIDUALIZED WEIGHT - BASED DOSING , WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE PERMIT SAFE ADMINISTRATION .
CONCOMITANT ADMINISTRATION OF PROMETHAZINE PRODUCTS WITH OTHER RESPIRATORY DEPRESSANTS HAS AN ASSOCIATION WITH RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION , AND SOMETIMES DEATH , IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS .
ANTIEMETICS ARE NOT RECOMMENDED FOR TREATMENT OF UNCOMPLICATED VOMITING IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS , AND THEIR USE SHOULD BE LIMITED TO PROLONGED VOMITING OF KNOWN ETIOLOGY .
THE EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS WHICH CAN OCCUR SECONDARY TO PROMETHAZINE PRODUCTS ADMINISTRATION MAY BE CONFUSED WITH THE CNS SIGNS OF UNDIAGNOSED PRIMARY DISEASE , e . g . , ENCEPHALOPATHY OR REYE ' S SYNDROME .
THE USE OF PROMETHAZINE PRODUCTS SHOULD BE AVOIDED IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WHOSE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS MAY SUGGEST REYE ' S SYNDROME OR OTHER HEPATIC DISEASES .
Excessively large dosages of antihistamines , including Promethazine products , in pediatric patients may cause sudden death ( see OVERDOSAGE ) .
Hallucinations and convulsions have occurred with therapeutic doses and overdoses of Promethazine in pediatric patients .
In pediatric patients who are acutely ill associated with dehydration , there is an increased susceptibility to dystonias with the use of promethazine HCl .
PRECAUTIONS General Promethazine should be used cautiously in persons with cardiovascular disease or with impairment of liver function .
Information for Patients Promethazine may cause marked drowsiness or may impair the mental and / or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks , such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery .
Ambulatory patients should be told to avoid engaging in such activities until it is known that they do not become drowsy or dizzy from promethazine therapy .
Children should be supervised to avoid potential harm in bike riding or in other hazardous activities .
The concomitant use of alcohol or other CNS depressants , including narcotic analgesics , sedatives , hypnotics and tranquilizers , may have an additive effect and should be avoided or their dosage reduced .
Patients should be advised to report any involuntary muscle movements or unusual sensitivity to sunlight .
Drug Interactions The sedative action of promethazine is additive to the sedative effects of other CNS depressants , including alcohol , narcotic analgesics , sedatives , hypnotics , tricyclic antidepressants and tranquilizers ; therefore , these agents should be avoided or administered in reduced dosage to patients receiving promethazine .
Drug / Laboratory Test Interactions The following laboratory tests may be affected in patients who are receiving therapy with promethazine hydrochloride : Pregnancy Tests Diagnostic pregnancy tests based on immunological reactions between HCG and anti - HCG may result in false - negative or false - positive interpretations .
Glucose Tolerance Test An increase in blood glucose has been reported in patients receiving promethazine .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term animal studies have not been performed to assess the carcinogenic potential of promethazine , nor are there other animal or human data concerning the carcinogenicity , mutagenicity or impairment of fertility with this drug .
Promethazine was nonmutagenic in the Salmonella test system of Ames .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects — Pregnancy Category C Teratogenic effects have not been demonstrated in rat - feeding studies at doses of 6 . 25 and 12 . 5 mg / kg of promethazine .
These doses are from approximately 2 . 1 to 4 . 2 times the maximum recommended total daily dose of promethazine for a 50 - kg subject , depending upon the indication for which the drug is prescribed .
Specific studies to test the action of the drug on parturition , lactation and development of the animal neonate were not done , but a general preliminary study in rats indicated no effect on these parameters .
Although antihistamines , including promethazine , have been found to produce fetal mortality in rodents , the pharmacological effects of histamine in the rodent do not parallel those in man .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of promethazine in pregnant women .
Promethazine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Nonteratogenic Effects Promethazine taken within two weeks of delivery may inhibit platelet aggregation in the newborn .
Labor and Delivery Promethazine , in appropriate dosage form , may be used alone or as an adjunct to narcotic analgesics during labor and delivery ( See " INDICATIONS AND USAGE " and " DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION " ) .
See also " Nonteratogenic Effects " .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether promethazine is excreted in human milk .
Caution should be exercised when promethazine is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use PROMETHAZINE PRODUCTS ARE CONTRAINDICATED FOR USE IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS LESS THAN TWO YEARS OF AGE ( see WARNINGS - Black Box Warning and Use in Pediatric Patients ) .
Promethazine products should be used with caution in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older ( see WARNINGS - Use in Pediatric Patients ) .
Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Promethazine formulations did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over - sedation in the elderly ; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of Promethazine products and observed closely .
ADVERSE REACTIONS CNS – Sedation , sleepiness , occasional blurred vision , dryness of mouth , dizziness ; rarely confusion , disorientation and extrapyramidal symptoms such as oculogyric crisis , torticollis and tongue protrusion ( usually in association with parenteral injection or excessive dosage ) .
Cardiovascular – Increased or decreased blood pressure .
Dermatologic – Rash , rarely photosensitivity .
Hematologic – Rarely leukopenia , thrombocytopenia ; agranulocytosis ( 1 case ) .
Gastrointestinal – Nausea and vomiting .
OVERDOSAGE Signs and symptoms of overdosage with promethazine range from mild depression of the CNS and cardiovascular system to profound hypotension , respiratory depression and unconsciousness .
Stimulation may be evident , especially in children and geriatric patients .
Convulsions may rarely occur .
A paradoxical reaction has been reported in children receiving single doses of 75 mg to 125 mg orally , characterized by hyperexcitability and nightmares .
Atropine - like signs and symptoms – dry mouth , fixed dilated pupils , flushing , as well as gastrointestinal symptoms , may occur .
Treatment The treatment of overdosage with promethazine is essentially symptomatic and supportive .
Only in cases of extreme overdosage or individual sensitivity do vital signs including respiration , pulse , blood pressure , temperature and EKG need to be monitored .
Activated charcoal orally or by lavage may be given , or sodium or magnesium sulfate orally as a cathartic .
Attention should be given to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation .
Diazepam may be used to control convulsions .
Acidosis and electrolyte losses should be corrected .
Note that any of the depressant effects of promethazine are not reversed by naloxone .
Avoid analeptics which may cause convulsions .
Severe hypotension usually responds to the administration of norepinephrine or phenylephrine .
EPINEPHRINE SHOULD NOT BE USED since its use in patients with partial adrenergic blockade may further lower the blood pressure .
Limited experience with dialysis indicates that it is not helpful .
