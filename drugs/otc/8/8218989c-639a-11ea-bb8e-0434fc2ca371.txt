6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of YONDELIS .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Vascular disorders : capillary leak syndrome 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • CYP3A inhibitors : Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A inhibitors ( 7 . 1 ) • CYP3A inducers : Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A inducers ( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Effect of Cytochrome CYP3A Inhibitors Coadministration of YONDELIS with ketoconazole , a strong CYP3A inhibitor , increased systemic exposure of trabectedin by 66 % .
Avoid using strong CYP3A inhibitors ( e . g . , oral ketoconazole , itraconazole , posaconazole , voriconazole , clarithromycin , telithromycin , indinavir , lopinavir , ritonavir , boceprevir , nelfinavir , saquinavir , telaprevir , nefazodone , conivaptan ) in patients taking YONDELIS .
If a strong CYP3A inhibitor for short - term use ( i . e . , less than 14 days ) must be used , administer the strong CYP3A inhibitor 1 week after the YONDELIS infusion , and discontinue it the day prior to the next YONDELIS infusion [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Effect of Cytochrome CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of YONDELIS with rifampin , a strong CYP3A inducer , decreased systemic exposure of trabectedin by 31 % .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed ( 8 . 2 ) • Hepatic Impairment : Do not administer YONDELIS to patients with severe hepatic impairment ( 8 . 6 , 12 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action , trabectedin can cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data with the use of YONDELIS during pregnancy .
Animal reproductive and developmental studies at relevant doses have not been conducted with trabectedin ; however , placental transfer of trabectedin was demonstrated in pregnant rats .
Advise pregnant woman of the potential risk to a fetus .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown ; however , the background risk in the U . S . general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 to 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of trabectedin in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from YONDELIS in breastfed infants , advise a nursing woman to discontinue nursing during treatment with YONDELIS .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating YONDELIS [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for 2 months after the last dose of YONDELIS [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Males YONDELIS may damage spermatozoa , resulting in possible genetic and fetal abnormalities .
Advise males with a female sexual partner of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for 5 months after the last dose of YONDELIS [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility YONDELIS may result in decreased fertility in males and females [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Safety ( n = 61 ) and efficacy ( n = 58 ) were assessed across five open - label studies ( NCT00006463 , NCT01453283 , NCT00005625 , NCT00070109 , and ET - B - 023 - 00 ) in pediatric patients ( aged 2 to < 17 years ) with pediatric histotypes of sarcoma ( predominantly rhabdomyosarcoma , osteosarcoma , Ewing sarcoma , and non - rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma ) .
No new safety signals were observed in pediatric patients across these studies .
Pharmacokinetic parameters in 17 pediatric patients ( aged 3 to 17 years ) were within the range of values previously observed in adults given the same dose per body surface area .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of YONDELIS did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment The mean trabectedin exposure was ( 97 % ) higher in patients with moderate ( bilirubin levels greater than 1 . 5 to 3 times the upper limit of normal , and AST and ALT less than 8 times the upper limit of normal ) hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal ( total bilirubin ≤ the upper limit of normal , and AST and ALT ≤ the upper limit of normal ) liver function .
Reduce YONDELIS dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Do not administer YONDELIS to patients with severe hepatic impairment ( bilirubin levels above 3 times the upper limit of normal , and any AST and ALT ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild [ creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) 60 – 89 mL / min ] or moderate ( CLcr of 30 – 59 mL / min ) renal impairment .
The pharmacokinetics of trabectedin has not been evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) or end stage renal disease [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no specific antidote for YONDELIS .
Hemodialysis is not expected to enhance the elimination of YONDELIS because trabectedin is highly bound to plasma proteins ( 97 % ) and not significantly renally excreted .

Each single - dose vial contains 1 mg of trabectedin , 27 . 2 mg potassium dihydrogen phosphate , 400 mg sucrose , and phosphoric acid and potassium hydroxide ( for pH adjustment to 3 . 6 – 4 . 2 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Trabectedin is an alkylating drug that binds guanine residues in the minor groove of DNA , forming adducts and resulting in a bending of the DNA helix towards the major groove .
Adduct formation triggers a cascade of events that can affect the subsequent activity of DNA binding proteins , including some transcription factors , and DNA repair pathways , resulting in perturbation of the cell cycle and eventual cell death .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of trabectedin on the QT / QTc interval was evaluated in 75 patients who received placebo on day 1 and trabectedin ( 1 . 3 mg / m2 ) as a 3 - hour intravenous infusion on day 2 .
No patients in the study showed a QTc interval exceeding 500 msec or more than 60 msec increase from baseline , and no large changes in the mean QTc interval ( i . e . , > 20 msec ) were observed .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of trabectedin is characterized by a rapid decline phase at the end of the infusion and slower exponential phases .
Population pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that the pharmacokinetics of trabectedin is dose - proportional ( over the dose range of 0 . 024 to 1 . 8 mg / m2 ) and exposure is time - independent .
No accumulation of trabectedin in plasma is observed upon repeated administrations every 3 weeks .
Distribution Binding of trabectedin to human plasma proteins was approximately 97 % , independent of trabectedin concentrations ranging from 10 ng / mL to 100 ng / mL .
Steady state volume of distribution of trabectedin exceeds 5000 L . Elimination The estimated mean ( % coefficient of variation ) clearance of trabectedin is 31 . 5 L / hr ( 50 % ) and the terminal elimination half - life is approximately 175 hours .
Metabolism CYP3A is the predominant CYP enzyme responsible for the hepatic metabolism of trabectedin .
Trabectedin was extensively metabolized with negligible unchanged drug in urine and feces following administration of trabectedin to humans .
Excretion In patients with solid tumors , following a 3 - hour or a 24 - hour intravenous infusion of 14 C - labeled trabectedin , 64 % of the total administered radioactive dose was recovered in 24 days , with 58 % in feces and 6 % in urine .
Specific Populations The following population characteristics are not associated with a clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of trabectedin : sex , age ( 19 to 83 years ) , body weight ( 36 to 148 kg ) , body surface area ( 0 . 9 to 2 . 8 m2 ) , mild hepatic impairment , or mild to moderate renal impairment .
The effects of severe hepatic impairment , severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease on trabectedin exposure are unknown .
Hepatic Impairment The geometric mean dose normalized trabectedin exposure ( AUC ) increased by 97 % ( 90 % CI : 20 % , 222 % ) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( bilirubin levels greater than 1 . 5 times to 3 times the upper limit of normal and AST and ALT less than 8 times the upper limit of normal ) following administration of a single YONDELIS dose of 0 . 58 mg / m2 or 0 . 9 mg / m2 compared to patients with normal liver function following administration of a single YONDELIS dose of 1 . 3 mg / m2 [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Drug Interactions Effect of Strong CYP3A Inhibitors on Trabectedin Coadministration of multiple doses of ketoconazole ( 200 mg twice daily for 7 . 5 days ) with a single dose of YONDELIS ( 0 . 58 mg / m2 ) on day 1 increased trabectedin dose - normalized AUC by 66 % and Cmax by 22 % compared to a single YONDELIS dose ( 1 . 3 mg / m2 ) given alone .
Effect of Strong CYP3A Inducers on Trabectedin Coadministration of multiple doses of rifampin ( 600 mg daily for 6 days ) with a single YONDELIS dose ( 1 . 3 mg / m2 ) on day 6 decreased trabectedin AUC by 31 % and Cmax by 21 % compared to a single YONDELIS dose ( 1 . 3 mg / m2 ) given alone .
Effect of Trabectedin on CYP Enzymes In vitro , trabectedin has limited inhibition or induction potential of major CYP enzymes ( CYP1A2 , 2A6 , 2B6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 2E1 , and 3A4 ) .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Trabectedin is genotoxic in both in vitro and in vivo studies .
Long - term carcinogenicity studies have not been performed .
Fertility studies with trabectedin were not performed .
In male rats there were limited histopathological signs of hemorrhage and degeneration in the testes following repeated administration of trabectedin at doses approximately 0 . 2 times the 1 . 5 mg / m2 human dose based on body surface area .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The clinical efficacy and safety of YONDELIS in patients with metastatic or recurrent leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma were demonstrated in Trial ET743 - SAR - 3007 ( NCT01343277 ) , a randomized ( 2 : 1 ) , open - label , active - controlled trial comparing treatment with YONDELIS 1 . 5 mg / m2 as a 24 - hour continuous intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks to dacarbazine 1000 mg / m2 intravenous infusion ( 20 to 120 minutes ) once every 3 weeks .
Treatment continued in both arms until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity ; all patients in the YONDELIS arm were required to receive dexamethasone 20 mg intravenous injection prior to each YONDELIS infusion .
Patients were required to have unresectable , locally advanced or metastatic leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma ( dedifferentiated , myxoid round cell , or pleomorphic ) and previous treatment with an anthracycline - and ifosfamide - containing regimen or an anthracycline - containing regimen and one additional cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen .
Randomization was stratified by subtype of soft tissue sarcoma ( leiomyosarcoma vs . liposarcoma ) , ECOG performance status ( 0 vs . 1 ) , and number of prior chemotherapy regimens ( 1 vs . ≥ 2 ) .
The efficacy outcome measures were investigator - assessed progression - free survival ( PFS ) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST v1 . 1 ) , overall survival ( OS ) , objective response rate ( ORR ) , and duration of response ( DOR ) .
Patients in the dacarbazine arm were not offered YONDELIS at the time of disease progression .
A total of 518 patients were randomized , 345 to the YONDELIS arm and 173 patients to the dacarbazine arm .
The median patient age was 56 years ( range : 17 to 81 ) ; 30 % were male ; 76 % White , 12 % Black , and 4 % Asian ; 73 % had leiomyosarcomas and 27 % liposarcomas ; 49 % had an ECOG PS of 0 ; and 89 % received ≥ 2 prior chemotherapy regimens .
The most common ( ≥ 20 % ) pre - study chemotherapeutic agents administered were doxorubicin ( 90 % ) , gemcitabine ( 81 % ) , docetaxel ( 74 % ) , and ifosfamide ( 59 % ) .
Approximately 10 % of patients had received pazopanib .
Trial ET743 - SAR - 3007 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS .
An exploratory analysis of independent radiology committee - determined PFS , in a subgroup consisting of approximately 60 % of the total population , provided similar results to the investigator - determined PFS .
Efficacy results from Trial ET743 - SAR - 3007 are presented in the table below .
