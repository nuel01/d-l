5 . 2 Fish Allergy Omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters capsules contain ethyl esters of omega - 3 fatty acids ( EPA and DHA ) obtained from the oil of several fish sources .
It is not known whether patients with allergies to fish and / or shellfish , are at increased risk of an allergic reaction to omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters capsules .
Omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters capsules should be used with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to fish and / or shellfish .
5 . 3 Recurrent Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) or Flutter In a double - blind , placebo - controlled trial of 663 subjects with symptomatic paroxysmal AF ( n = 542 ) or persistent AF ( n = 121 ) , recurrent AF or flutter was observed in subjects randomized to omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters who received 8 grams per day for 7 days and 4 grams per day thereafter for 23 weeks at a higher rate relative to placebo .
Subjects in this trial had median baseline triglycerides of 127 mg per dL , had no substantial structural heart disease , were taking no anti - arrhythmic therapy ( rate control permitted ) , and were in normal sinus rhythm at baseline .
At 24 weeks , in the paroxysmal AF stratum , there were 129 ( 47 % ) first recurrent symptomatic AF or flutter events on placebo and 141 ( 53 % ) on omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters ( primary endpoint , HR 1 . 19 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 93 , 1 . 35 ) .
In the persistent AF stratum , there were 19 ( 35 % ) events on placebo and 34 ( 52 % ) events on omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters ( HR 1 . 63 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 91 , 2 . 18 ) .
For both strata combined , the HR was 1 . 25 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 00 , 1 . 40 .
Although the clinical significance of these results is uncertain , there is a possible association between omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters and more frequent recurrences of symptomatic atrial fibrillation or flutter in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation , particularly within the first 2 to 3 months of initiating therapy .
Omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters capsules are not indicated for the treatment of AF or flutter .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Adverse reactions reported in at least 3 % of subjects treated with omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters capsules and at a greater rate than placebo based on pooled data across 23 clinical trials are listed in Table 1 .
Table 1 .

The following events have been reported : anaphylactic reaction , hemorrhagic diathesis , urticaria .
7 . 1 Anticoagulants or Other Drugs Affecting Coagulation Some trials with omega - 3 - acids demonstrated prolongation of bleeding time .
The prolongation of bleeding time reported in these trials has not exceeded normal limits and did not produce clinically significant bleeding episodes .
Clinical trials have not been done to thoroughly examine the effect of omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters and concomitant anticoagulants .
Patients receiving treatment with omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters and an anticoagulant or other drug affecting coagulation ( e . g . , anti - platelet agents ) should be monitored periodically .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C : There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
It is unknown whether omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters capsules can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity .
Omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters capsules should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the patient justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Animal Data : Omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters have been shown to have an embryocidal effect in pregnant rats when given in doses resulting in exposures 7 times the recommended human dose of 4 grams per day based on a body surface area comparison .
In female rats given oral gavage doses of 100 , 600 , and 2 , 000 mg per kg per day beginning 2 weeks prior to mating and continuing through gestation and lactation , no adverse effects were observed in the high - dose group ( 5 times human systemic exposure following an oral dose of 4 grams per day based on body surface area comparison ) .
In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 1 , 000 , 3 , 000 , and 6 , 000 mg per kg per day from gestation day 6 through 15 , no adverse effects were observed ( 14 times human systemic exposure following an oral dose of 4 grams per day based on a body surface area comparison ) .
In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 100 , 600 , and 2 , 000 mg per kg per day from gestation day 14 through lactation day 21 , no adverse effects were seen at 2 , 000 mg per kg per day ( 5 times the human systemic exposure following an oral dose of 4 grams per day based on a body surface area comparison ) .
However , decreased live births ( 20 % reduction ) and decreased survival to postnatal day 4 ( 40 % reduction ) were observed in a dose - ranging study using higher doses of 3 , 000 mg per kg per day ( 7 times the human systemic exposure following an oral dose of 4 grams per day based on a body surface area comparison ) .
In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 375 , 750 , and 1 , 500 mg per kg per day from gestation day 7 through 19 , no findings were observed in the fetuses in groups given 375 mg / kg / day ( 2 times human systemic exposure following an oral dose of 4 grams per day based on a body surface area comparison ) .
However , at higher doses , evidence of maternal toxicity was observed ( 4 times human systemic exposure following an oral dose of 4 grams per day based on a body surface area comparison ) .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Studies with omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters have demonstrated excretion in human milk .
The effect of this excretion on the infant of a nursing mother is unknown ; caution should be exercised when omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters capsules are administered to a nursing mother .
An animal study in lactating rats given oral gavage 14 C - ethyl EPA demonstrated that drug levels were 6 to 14 times higher in milk than in plasma .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use A limited number of subjects older than 65 years were enrolled in the clinical trials of omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters capsules .
Safety and efficacy findings in subjects older than 60 years did not appear to differ from those of subjects younger than 60 years .
Omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters capsules do not have any known drug abuse or withdrawal effects .
Omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters capsules , USP , a lipid - regulating agent , are supplied as a liquid - filled gel capsule for oral administration .
Each 1 - gram capsule of omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters capsules , USP contains at least 900 mg of the ethyl esters of omega - 3 fatty acids sourced from fish oils .
These are predominantly a combination of ethyl esters of eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA - approximately 465 mg ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA - approximately 375 mg ) .
The molecular formula of EPA ethyl ester is C22H34O2 , and the molecular weight of EPA ethyl ester is 330 . 51 .
The structural formula of EPA ethyl ester is : [ EPA - structure ] The molecular formula of DHA ethyl ester is C24H36O2 , and the molecular weight of DHA ethyl ester is 356 . 55 .
The structural formula of DHA ethyl ester is : [ DHA - structure ] Omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters capsules , USP also contain the following inactive ingredients : 4 mg α - tocopherol ( in a carrier of soybean oil ) , and gelatin , glycerin , purified water , and white ink ( components of the capsule shell ) .

12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters is not completely understood .
Potential mechanisms of action include inhibition of acyl - CoA : 1 , 2 - diacylglycerol acyltransferase , increased mitochondrial and peroxisomal β - oxidation in the liver , decreased lipogenesis in the liver , and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity .
Omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters may reduce the synthesis of triglycerides in the liver because EPA and DHA are poor substrates for the enzymes responsible for TG synthesis , and EPA and DHA inhibit esterification of other fatty acids .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In healthy volunteers and in subjects with hypertriglyceridemia , EPA and DHA were absorbed when administered as ethyl esters orally .
Omega - 3 - acids administered as ethyl esters induced significant , dose - dependent increases in serum phospholipid EPA content , though increases in DHA content were less marked and not dose - dependent when administered as ethyl esters .
Specific Populations : Age : Uptake of EPA and DHA into serum phospholipids in subjects treated with omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters was independent of age ( younger than 49 years versus 49 years and older ) .
Male and Female Patients : Females tended to have more uptake of EPA into serum phospholipids than males .
The clinical significance of this is unknown .
Pediatric Patients : Pharmacokinetics of omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters have not been studied .
Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment .
Drug Interaction Studies : Simvastatin : In a 14 - day trial of 24 healthy adult subjects , daily coadministration of simvastatin 80 mg with omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters 4 grams did not affect the extent ( AUC ) or rate ( Cmax ) of exposure to simvastatin or the major active metabolite , beta - hydroxy simvastatin at steady state .
Atorvastatin : In a 14 - day trial of 50 healthy adult subjects , daily coadministration of atorvastatin 80 mg with omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters 4 grams did not affect AUC or Cmax of exposure to atorvastatin , 2 - hydroxyatorvastatin , or 4 - hydroxyatorvastatin at steady state .
Rosuvastatin : In a 14 - day trial of 48 healthy adult subjects , daily coadministration of rosuvastatin 40 mg with omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters 4 grams did not affect AUC or Cmax of exposure to rosuvastatin at steady state .
In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that clinically significant cytochrome P450 - mediated inhibition by EPA / DHA combinations are not expected in humans .
13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a rat carcinogenicity study with oral gavage doses of 100 , 600 , and 2 , 000 mg per kg per day , males were treated with omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters for 101 weeks and females for 89 weeks without an increased incidence of tumors ( up to 5 times human systemic exposures following an oral dose of 4 grams per day based on a body surface area comparison ) .
Standard lifetime carcinogenicity bioassays were not conducted in mice .

In a rat fertility study with oral gavage doses of 100 , 600 , and 2 , 000 mg per kg per day , males were treated for 10 weeks prior to mating and females were treated for 2 weeks prior to and throughout mating , gestation , and lactation .
No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 2 , 000 mg / kg / day ( 5 times human systemic exposure following an oral dose of 4 grams / day based on a body surface area comparison ) .
14 . 1 Severe Hypertriglyceridemia The effects of omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters 4 grams per day were assessed in 2 randomized , placebo - controlled , double - blind , parallel - group trials of 84 adult subjects ( 42 on omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters , 42 on placebo ) with very high triglyceride levels .
Subjects whose baseline triglyceride levels were between 500 and 2 , 000 mg per dL were enrolled in these 2 trials of 6 and 16 weeks ' duration .
The median triglyceride and LDL - C levels in these subjects were 792 mg per dL and 100 mg per dL , respectively .
Median high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL - C ) level was 23 . 0 mg per dL .
The changes in the major lipoprotein lipid parameters for the groups receiving omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters or placebo are shown in Table 2 .
Table 2 .
Median Baseline and Percent Change from Baseline in Lipid Parameters in Subjects With Severe Hypertriglyceridemia ( ≥ 500 mg / dL ) Parameter Omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters n = 42 Placebo n = 42 Difference BL % Change BL % Change TG 816 - 44 . 9 788 + 6 . 7 - 51 . 6 Non - HDL - C 271 - 13 . 8 292 - 3 . 6 - 10 . 2 TC 296 - 9 . 7 314 - 1 . 7 - 8 . 0 VLDL - C 175 - 41 . 7 175 - 0 . 9 - 40 . 8 HDL - C 22 + 9 . 1 24 0 . 0 + 9 . 1 LDL - C 89 + 44 . 5 108 - 4 . 8 + 49 . 3 BL = Baseline ( mg per dL ) ; % Change = Median Percent Change from Baseline ; Difference = omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters Median % Change - Placebo Median % Change .
VLDL - C = Very - low density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) cholesterol .
Omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters 4 grams per day reduced median TG , VLDL - C , and non - HDL - C levels and increased median HDL - C from baseline relative to placebo .
Treatment with omega - 3 - acid ethyl esters to reduce very high TG levels may result in elevations in LDL - C and non - HDL - C in some individuals .
Patients should be monitored to ensure that the LDL - C level does not increase excessively .
