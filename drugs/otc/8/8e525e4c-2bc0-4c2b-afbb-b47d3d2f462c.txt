NONELECTROLYTE IRRIGATING FLUID FOR TRANSURETHRAL SURGICAL PROCEDURES .
For Urologic Irrigation Only ; Not For Injection By Usual Parenteral Routes Flexible Irrigation Container Rx only DESCRIPTION 1 . 5 % Glycine Irrigation , USP is a sterile , nonpyrogenic , hypotonic , aqueous solution of glycine intended only for urologic irrigation during transurethral surgical procedures .
Each 100 mL contains 1 . 5 g of glycine in water for injection .
The solution is nonelectrolytic , hypotonic and has an osmolarity of 200 mOsmol / liter ( calc . )
; pH 6 . 0 ( 4 . 5 to 6 . 5 ) .
The solution contains no bacteriostat , antimicrobial agent or added buffer and is intended only for use as a single - dose irrigation .
When smaller volumes are required , the unused portion should be discarded .
1 . 5 % Glycine Irrigation is a urologic nonelectrolyte irrigant .
Glycine , USP is chemically designated aminoacetic acid ( C2H5NO2 ) , a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water .
It has the following structural formula : NH2CH2COOH Water for Injection , USP is chemically designated H20 .
The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinylchloride .
Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly .
The semi - rigid container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyolefin .
It is a copolymer of ethylene and propylene .
The container requires no vapor barrier to maintain the proper drug concentration .
The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinylchloride .
Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts ; however , biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials .
Exposure to temperatures above 25 ° C / 77 ° F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content .
Higher temperatures lead to greater losses .
It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Glycine is an amino acid and a nonelectrolyte .
A solution of glycine in water is therefore nonconductive and suitable for urologic irrigation during electrosurgical procedures .
A 1 . 5 % concentration of glycine in water ( 200 mOsmol / liter calc . )
is sufficient to minimize the risk of intravascular hemolysis which can occur from absorption of plain water through open prostatic veins during transurethral resection ( TUR ) .
It is hypotonic in relation to the extracellular fluid ( 280 mOsmol / liter ) .
Any solution absorbed intravascularly during transurethral prostatic or bladder surgery , although variable in amount depending primarily on the extent of surgery , will be excreted by the kidney .
Studies have shown that the absorption of glycine does not cause significant hemolysis ( increase of free hemoglobin ) or release significant amounts of free ammonia in the blood .
Glycine is rapidly degraded in the liver by glycine oxidase .
Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70 % of total body weight .
Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters ( 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production ) .
Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms .
Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium ( Na + ) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1 . 5 % Glycine Irrigation , USP is indicated for use as irrigating fluid during transurethral prostatic resection and other transurethral surgical procedures .
CONTRAINDICATIONS NOT FOR INJECTION BY USUAL PARENTERAL ROUTES .
Do not use in patients with anuria .
WARNINGS FOR UROLOGIC IRRIGATION ONLY .
Solutions for urologic irrigation must be used with caution in patients with severe cardiopulmonary or renal dysfunction .
Irrigating fluids used during transurethral prostatectomy have been demonstrated to enter the systemic circulation in relatively large volumes .
Thus , glycine irrigating solution must be regarded as a systemic drug .
Absorption of large amounts of fluids containing glycine may significantly alter cardiopulmonary and renal dynamics .
Do not heat container over 66 ° C ( 150 ° F ) .
PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular status , especially of the patient with cardiac disease , should be carefully observed before and during transurethral resection of the prostate when using glycine irrigating solution , because the quantity of fluid absorbed into the systemic circulation by opened prostatic veins may produce significant expansion of the extracellular fluid and lead to fulminating congestive heart failure .
Shift of sodium free intracellular fluid into the extracellular compartment following systemic absorption of solution may lower serum sodium concentration and aggravate pre - existing hyponatremia .
Care should be exercised if impaired liver function is known or suspected .
Under such conditions , ammonia resulting from metabolism of glycine may accumulate in the blood .
Aseptic technique is essential with the use of sterile solutions for irrigation .
The administration set should be attached promptly .
Unused portions should be discarded and a fresh container of appropriate size used for the start - up of each cycle or repeat procedure .
Do not administer unless solution is clear , seal is intact and container is undamaged .
Discard unused portion .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Studies with Glycine Irrigation , USP have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , mutagenic potential , or effects on fertility .
Nursing Mothers : Caution should be exercised when Glycine Irrigation , USP is administered to a nursing woman .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects .
Pregnancy Category C . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Glycine Irrigation , USP .
It is also not known whether Glycine Irrigation , USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Glycine Irrigation , USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Pediatric Use : The safety and effectiveness of Glycine Irrigation have not been established .
Its limited use in pediatric patients has been inadequate to fully define proper dosage and limitations for use .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions may result from intravascular absorption of glycine .
Large intravenous doses of glycine are known to cause salivation , nausea and lightheadedness .
Other consequences of absorption of urologic irrigating solutions include fluid and electrolyte disturbances such as acidosis , electrolyte loss , marked diuresis , urinary retention , edema , dryness of mouth , thirst , dehydration , coma from hyponatremia , secondary hyponatremia due to fluid overload , and hyperammonemia with resultant coma and / or encephalopathy ; cardiovascular disorders such as hypotension , tachycardia , angina - like pains ; pulmonary disorders such as pulmonary congestion ; and other general reactions such as blurred vision , convulsions , nausea , vomiting , rhinitis , chills , vertigo , backache , transient blindness and urticaria .
Allergic reactions from glycine are unknown or exceedingly rare .
Should any adverse reaction occur , discontinue the irrigant , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of overhydration or solute overload , re - evaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective measures .
See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 1 . 5 % Glycine Irrigation , USP should be administered only by transurethral instillation with appropriate urologic instrumentation .
A disposable irrigation set should be used .
The total volume of solution used for irrigation is solely at the discretion of the surgeon .
Height of container ( s ) above the operating table in excess of 60 cm ( approx .
2 ft . ) has been reported to increase intravascular absorption of the irrigating fluid .

Consult with pharmacist , if available .
When introducing additives , use aseptic technique , mix thoroughly and do not store .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution container permits .
