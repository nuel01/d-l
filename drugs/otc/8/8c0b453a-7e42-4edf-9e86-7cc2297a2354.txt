DESCRIPTION Fluorouracil cream , 0 . 5 % , contains fluorouracil for topical dermatologic use .
Chemically , fluorouracil is 5 - fluoro - 2 , 4 ( 1 H , 3 H ) - pyrimidinedione .
The molecular formula is C4H3FN2O2 .
Fluorouracil has a molecular weight of 130 . 08 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Fluorouracil cream contains 0 . 5 % fluorouracil , with 0 . 35 % being incorporated into a patented porous microsphere ( Microsponge ® ) composed of methyl methacrylate / glycol dimethacrylate crosspolymer and dimethicone .
The cream formulation contains the following other inactive ingredients : Carbomer Homopolymer Type C , glycerin , methyl gluceth - 20 , methylparaben , octyl hydroxy stearate , polyethylene glycol 400 , polysorbate 80 , propylene glycol , propylparaben , purified water , sorbitan monooleate , stearic acid , and trolamine .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY There is evidence that the metabolism of fluorouracil in the anabolic pathway blocks the methylation reaction of deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid .
In this manner , fluorouracil interferes with the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) and to a lesser extent inhibits the formation of ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) .
Since DNA and RNA are essential for cell division and growth , the effect of fluorouracil may be to create a thymine deficiency that provokes unbalanced growth and death of the cell .
The effects of DNA and RNA deprivation are most marked on those cells that grow more rapidly and take up fluorouracil at a more rapid rate .
The contribution to efficacy or safety of individual components of the vehicle has not been established .
Pharmacokinetics A multiple - dose , randomized , open - label , parallel study was performed in 21 patients with actinic keratoses .
Twenty patients had pharmacokinetic samples collected : 10 patients treated with fluorouracil cream , 0 . 5 % and 10 treated with Efudex ® 5 % Cream .
Patients were treated for a maximum of 28 days with fluorouracil cream , 0 . 5 % , 1 g once daily in the morning ; or Efudex ® 5 % Cream , 1 g twice daily , in the morning and evening .
Steady - state plasma concentrations and the amounts of fluorouracil in urine resulting from the topical application of either product were measured .
Three patients who received fluorouracil cream , 0 . 5 % and nine patients who received Efudex ® 5 % Cream had measurable plasma fluorouracil levels ; however , only one patient receiving fluorouracil cream , 0 . 5 % and six patients receiving Efudex ® 5 % Cream had a sufficient number of data points to calculate mean pharmacokinetic parameters .

Cumulative urinary excretion of fluorouracil was low for fluorouracil cream , 0 . 5 % and for Efudex ® , corresponding to 0 . 055 % and 0 . 24 % of the applied doses , respectively .
Clinical Trials Under the experimental conditions of the topical safety studies , fluorouracil cream 0 . 5 % was not observed to cause contact sensitization .
However , approximately 95 % of subjects in the active arms of the Phase 3 clinical studies experienced facial irritation .
Irritation is likely and sensitization is unlikely based on the results of the topical safety and Phase 3 studies .
Two Phase 3 identically designed , multicenter , vehicle - controlled , double - blind studies were conducted to evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of fluorouracil cream , 0 . 5 % .
Patients with five or more actinic keratoses ( AKs ) on the face or anterior bald scalp were randomly allocated to active or vehicle treatment in a 2 : 1 ratio .
Patients were randomly allocated to treatment durations of 1 , 2 , or 4 weeks in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio .
They applied the study cream once daily to the entire face / anterior bald scalp .
Each patient ' s clinical response was evaluated 4 weeks after the patient ' s last scheduled application of study cream .
No additional post - treatment follow - up efficacy or safety assessments were performed beyond 4 weeks after the last scheduled application .
The following graphs show the percentage of patients in whom 100 % of treated lesions cleared , and the percentage of patients in whom 75 % or more of treated lesions cleared .
Treatment with fluorouracil cream , 0 . 5 % for 1 , 2 , or 4 weeks is compared to treatment with vehicle cream .
Outcomes from 1 , 2 , and 4 weeks of treatment with vehicle cream are pooled because duration of treatment with vehicle had no substantive effect on clearance .
Results from the two Phase 3 studies are shown separately .
Although all treatment regimens of fluorouracil cream , 0 . 5 % studied demonstrated efficacy over vehicle for the treatment of actinic keratosis , continuing treatment up to 4 weeks as tolerated results in further lesion reduction and clearing .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Clinical efficacy and safety in the treatment of AKs on the ears and other sun - exposed areas were not evaluated in the studies .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fluorouracil cream , 0 . 5 % is indicated for the topical treatment of multiple actinic or solar keratoses of the face and anterior scalp .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Fluorouracil may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Fluorouracil is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus .
No adequate and well - controlled studies have been conducted in pregnant women with either topical or parenteral forms of fluorouracil .
One birth defect ( ventricular septal defect ) and cases of miscarriage have been reported when fluorouracil was applied to mucous membrane areas .
Multiple birth defects have been reported in the fetus of a patient treated with intravenous fluorouracil .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with fluorouracil cream , 0 . 5 % .
Fluorouracil , the active ingredient , has been shown to be teratogenic in mice , rats , and hamsters when administered parenterally at doses greater than or equal to 10 , 15 , and 33 mg / kg / day , respectively , [ 4 X , 11 X and 20 X , respectively , the Maximum Recommended Human Dose ( MRHD ) based on body surface area ( BSA ) ] .
Fluorouracil was administered during the period of organogenesis for each species .
Embryolethal effects occurred in monkeys at parenteral doses greater than 40 mg / kg / day ( 65 X the MRHD based on BSA ) administered during the period of organogenesis .
Fluorouracil cream , 0 . 5 % should not be used in patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) enzyme deficiency .
A large percentage of fluorouracil is catabolized by the DPD enzyme .
DPD enzyme deficiency can result in shunting of fluorouracil to the anabolic pathway , leading to cytotoxic activity and potential toxicities .
Fluorouracil cream , 0 . 5 % is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its components .
WARNINGS The potential for a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to fluorouracil exists .
Patch testing to prove hypersensitivity may be inconclusive .
Patients should discontinue therapy with fluorouracil cream , 0 . 5 % if symptoms of DPD enzyme deficiency develop .
Rarely , unexpected systemic toxicity ( e . g . , stomatitis , diarrhea , neutropenia , neurotoxicity ) associated with parenteral administration of fluorouracil has been attributed to deficiency of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase " DPD " activity .
One case of life - threatening systemic toxicity has been reported with the topical use of 5 % fluorouracil in a patient with a complete absence of DPD enzyme activity .
Symptoms included severe abdominal pain , bloody diarrhea , vomiting , fever , and chills .
Physical examination revealed stomatitis , erythematous skin rash , neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , inflammation of the esophagus , stomach , and small bowel .
Although this case was observed with 5 % fluorouracil cream , it is unknown whether patients with profound DPD enzyme deficiency would develop systemic toxicity with lower concentrations of topically applied fluorouracil .
Applications to mucous membranes should be avoided due to the possibility of local inflammation and ulceration .
PRECAUTIONS General There is a possibility of increased absorption through ulcerated or inflamed skin .

Laboratory Tests To rule out the presence of a frank neoplasm , a biopsy may be considered for those areas failing to respond to treatment or recurring after treatment .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , and Impairment of Fertility Adequate long - term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted with fluorouracil .
Studies with the active ingredient of fluorouracil cream , 0 . 5 % , fluorouracil , have shown positive effects in in vitro and in vivo tests for mutagenicity and on impairment of fertility in in vivo animal studies .
Fluorouracil produced morphological transformation of cells in in vitro cell transformation assays .
Morphological transformation was also produced in an in vitro assay by a metabolite of fluorouracil , and the transformed cells produced malignant tumors when injected into immunosuppressed syngeneic mice .
Fluorouracil has been shown to exert mutagenic activity in yeast cells , Bacillus subtilis , and Drosophila assays .
In addition , fluorouracil has produced chromosome damage at concentrations of 1 . 0 and 2 . 0 mcg / mL in an in vitro hamster fibroblast assay , was positive in a microwell mouse lymphoma assay , and was positive in in vivo micronucleus assays in rats and mice following intraperitoneal administration .
Some patients receiving cumulative doses of 0 . 24 to 1 . 0 g of fluorouracil parenterally have shown an increase in numerical and structural chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes .
Fluorouracil has been shown to impair fertility after parenteral administration in rats .
Fluorouracil administered at intraperitoneal doses of 125 and 250 mg / kg has been shown to induce chromosomal aberrations and changes in chromosome organization of spermatogonia in rats .
In mice , single - dose intravenous and intraperitoneal injections of fluorouracil have been reported to kill differentiated spermatogonia and spermatocytes at a dose of 500 mg / kg and produce abnormalities in spermatids at 50 mg / kg .
Pediatric Use Actinic keratosis is not a condition seen within the pediatric population , except in association with rare genetic diseases .
Fluorouracil cream , 0 . 5 % should not be used in children .
The safety and effectiveness of fluorouracil cream , 0 . 5 % have not been established in patients less than 18 years old .
Geriatric Use No significant differences in safety and efficacy measures were demonstrated in patients age 65 and older compared to all other patients .
Pregnancy See CONTRAINDICATIONS Nursing Mothers It is not known whether fluorouracil is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from fluorouracil , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
