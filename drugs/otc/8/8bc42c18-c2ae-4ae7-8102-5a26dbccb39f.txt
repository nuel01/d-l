WARNING : FETAL TOXICITY See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning .
When pregnancy is detected , discontinue losartan potassium as soon as possible .
Drugs that act directly on the renin - angiotensin system can cause injury and death to the developing fetus .
( 5 . 1 ) 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Losartan potassium tablets are an angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB ) indicated for : • • Treatment of hypertension , to lower blood pressure in adults and children greater than 6 years old .
Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events , primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions .
( 1 . 1 ) • • Reduction of the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy .
There is evidence that this benefit does not apply to Black patients .
( 1 . 2 ) • • Treatment of diabetic nephropathy with an elevated serum creatinine and proteinuria in patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of hypertension .
( 1 . 3 ) 1 . 1 Hypertension Losartan potassium tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older , to lower blood pressure .
Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular ( CV ) events , primarily strokes and myocardial infarction .
These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including losartan .
Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management , including , as appropriate , lipid control , diabetes management , antithrombotic therapy , smoking cessation , exercise , and limited sodium intake .
Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals .
For specific advice on goals and management , see published guidelines , such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program ’ s Joint National Committee on Prevention , Detection , Evaluation , and Treatment of High Blood Pressure ( JNC ) .
Numerous antihypertensive drugs , from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action , have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality , and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction , and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs , that is largely responsible for those benefits .
The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke , but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly .
Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk , and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures , so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit .
Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk , so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension ( for example , patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia ) , and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal .
Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects ( as monotherapy ) in Black patients , and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects ( e . g . , on angina , heart failure , or diabetic kidney disease ) .
These considerations may guide selection of therapy .
Losartan potassium tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents .
1 . 2 Hypertensive Patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Losartan potassium tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy , but there is evidence that this benefit does not apply to Black patients [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
1 . 3 Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients Losartan potassium tablets are indicated for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy with an elevated serum creatinine and proteinuria ( urinary albumin to creatinine ratio ≥ 300 mg / g ) in patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of hypertension .
In this population , losartan potassium tablets reduces the rate of progression of nephropathy as measured by the occurrence of doubling of serum creatinine or end stage renal disease ( need for dialysis or renal transplantation ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .

( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Hypotension : Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of losartan potassium .
( 5 . 2 ) • • Monitor renal function and potassium in susceptible patients .
( 5 . 3 , 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Fetal Toxicity Use of drugs that act on the renin - angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death .
Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations .
Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia , anuria , hypotension , renal failure , and death .
When pregnancy is detected , discontinue losartan potassium as soon as possible [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 2 Hypotension in Volume - or Salt - Depleted Patients In patients with an activated renin - angiotensin system , such as volume - or salt - depleted patients ( e . g . , those being treated with high doses of diuretics ) , symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiation of treatment with losartan potassium .
Correct volume or salt depletion prior to administration of losartan potassium [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 3 Renal Function Deterioration Changes in renal function including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin - angiotensin system and by diuretics .
Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin - angiotensin system ( e . g . , patients with renal artery stenosis , chronic kidney disease , severe congestive heart failure , or volume depletion ) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on losartan potassium .
Monitor renal function periodically in these patients .
Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on losartan potassium [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
5 . 4 Hyperkalemia Monitor serum potassium periodically and treat appropriately .
Dosage reduction or discontinuation of losartan potassium may be required [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Concomitant use of other drugs that may increase serum potassium may lead to hyperkalemia [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 2 % and greater than placebo ) are : dizziness , upper respiratory infection , nasal congestion , and back pain .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Rising Health , LLC at 1 - 833 - 395 - 6928 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Hypertension Losartan potassium has been evaluated for safety in more than 3300 adult patients treated for essential hypertension and 4058 patients / subjects overall .
Over 1200 patients were treated for over 6 months and more than 800 for over one year .
Treatment with losartan potassium was well - tolerated with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to that of placebo .
In controlled clinical trials , discontinuation of therapy for adverse events occurred in 2 . 3 % of patients treated with losartan potassium and 3 . 7 % of patients given placebo .
In 4 clinical trials involving over 1000 patients on various doses ( 10 to 150 mg ) of losartan potassium and over 300 patients given placebo , the adverse events that occurred in ≥ 2 % of patients treated with losartan potassium and more commonly than placebo were : dizziness ( 3 % vs . 2 % ) , upper respiratory infection ( 8 % vs . 7 % ) , nasal congestion ( 2 % vs . 1 % ) , and back pain ( 2 % vs . 1 % ) .
The following less common adverse reactions have been reported : Blood and lymphatic system disorders : Anemia .
Psychiatric disorders : Depression .
Nervous system disorders : Somnolence , headache , sleep disorders , paresthesia , migraine .
Ear and labyrinth disorders : Vertigo , tinnitus .
Cardiac disorders : Palpitations , syncope , atrial fibrillation , CVA .
Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders : Dyspnea .
Gastrointestinal disorders : Abdominal pain , constipation , nausea , vomiting .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Urticaria , pruritus , rash , photosensitivity .
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : Myalgia , arthralgia .
Reproductive system and breast disorders : Impotence .
General disorders and administration site conditions : Edema .
Cough Persistent dry cough ( with an incidence of a few percent ) has been associated with ACE - inhibitor use and in practice can be a cause of discontinuation of ACE - inhibitor therapy .
Two prospective , parallel - group , double - blind , randomized , controlled trials were conducted to assess the effects of losartan on the incidence of cough in hypertensive patients who had experienced cough while receiving ACE - inhibitor therapy .
Patients who had typical ACE - inhibitor cough when challenged with lisinopril , whose cough disappeared on placebo , were randomized to losartan 50 mg , lisinopril 20 mg , or either placebo ( one study , n = 97 ) or 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide ( n = 135 ) .
The double - blind treatment period lasted up to 8 weeks .
The incidence of cough is shown in Table 1 below .
Table 1 : * Demographics = ( 89 % Caucasian , 64 % female ) † Demographics = ( 90 % Caucasian , 51 % female ) Study 1 * HCTZ Losartan Lisinopril Cough 25 % 17 % 69 % Study 2 † Placebo Losartan Lisinopril Cough 35 % 29 % 62 % These studies demonstrate that the incidence of cough associated with losartan therapy , in a population that all had cough associated with ACE - inhibitor therapy , is similar to that associated with hydrochlorothiazide or placebo therapy .
Cases of cough , including positive re - challenges , have been reported with the use of losartan in postmarketing experience .
Hypertensive Patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy In the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint ( LIFE ) study , adverse reactions with losartan potassium were similar to those reported previously for patients with hypertension .
Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients In the Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonist Losartan ( RENAAL ) study involving 1513 patients treated with losartan potassium or placebo , the overall incidences of reported adverse events were similar for the two groups .
Discontinuations of losartan potassium because of side effects were similar to placebo ( 19 % for losartan potassium , 24 % for placebo ) .
The adverse events , regardless of drug relationship , reported with an incidence of ≥ 4 % of patients treated with losartan potassium and occurring with ≥ 2 % difference in the losartan group vs . placebo on a background of conventional antihypertensive therapy , were asthenia / fatigue , chest pain , hypotension , orthostatic hypotension , diarrhea , anemia , hyperkalemia , hypoglycemia , back pain , muscular weakness , and urinary tract infection .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in postmarketing experience with losartan potassium .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure : Digestive : Hepatitis .
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : Malaise .
Hematologic : Thrombocytopenia .
Hypersensitivity : Angioedema , including swelling of the larynx and glottis , causing airway obstruction and / or swelling of the face , lips , pharynx , and / or tongue has been reported rarely in patients treated with losartan ; some of these patients previously experienced angioedema with other drugs including ACE inhibitors .
Vasculitis , including Henoch - Schönlein purpura , has been reported .
Anaphylactic reactions have been reported .
Metabolic and Nutrition : Hyponatremia .
Musculoskeletal : Rhabdomyolysis .
Nervous system disorders : Dysgeusia .
Skin : Erythroderma .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • • Agents increasing serum potassium : Risk of hyperkalemia .
( 7 . 1 ) • • Lithium : Risk of lithium toxicity .
( 7 . 2 ) • • NSAIDs : Increased risk of renal impairment and reduced diuretic , natriuretic , and antihypertensive effects .
( 7 . 3 ) • • Dual inhibition of the renin - angiotensin system : Increased risk of renal impairment , hypotension , syncope , and hyperkalemia .
( 7 . 4 ) 7 . 1 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium Coadministration of losartan with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia .
Monitor serum potassium in such patients .
7 . 2 Lithium Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists .
Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use .
7 . 3 Non - Steroidal Anti - Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) Including Selective Cyclooxygenase - 2 Inhibitors ( COX - 2 Inhibitors ) In patients who are elderly , volume - depleted ( including those on diuretic therapy ) , or with compromised renal function , coadministration of NSAIDs , including selective COX - 2 inhibitors , with angiotensin II receptor antagonists ( including losartan ) may result in deterioration of renal function , including possible acute renal failure .
These effects are usually reversible .
Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving losartan and NSAID therapy .
The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists , including losartan , may be attenuated by NSAIDs , including selective COX - 2 inhibitors .
7 . 4 Dual Blockade of the Renin - Angiotensin System ( RAS ) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers , ACE inhibitors , or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension , syncope , hyperkalemia , and changes in renal function ( including acute renal failure ) compared to monotherapy .
The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes ( VA NEPHRON - D ) trial enrolled 1448 patients with type 2 diabetes , elevated urinary - albumin - to - creatinine ratio , and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR 30 to 89 . 9 mL / min ) , randomized them to lisinopril or placebo on a background of losartan therapy and followed them for a median of 2 . 2 years .
Patients receiving the combination of losartan and lisinopril did not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy for the combined endpoint of decline in GFR , end stage renal disease , or death , but experienced an increased incidence of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury compared with the monotherapy group .
In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly .
In general , avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors .
Closely monitor blood pressure , renal function , and electrolytes in patients on losartan potassium and other agents that affect the RAS .
Do not coadminister aliskiren with losartan potassium in patients with diabetes .
Avoid use of aliskiren with losartan potassium in patients with renal impairment ( GFR < 60 mL / min ) .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Losartan potassium is not recommended in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age or in pediatric patients with glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 .
( 2 . 1 , 8 . 4 ) • • Hepatic Impairment : Recommended starting dose 25 mg once daily .
( 2 . 4 , 8 . 8 , 12 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin - angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death .
Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations .
Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia , anuria , hypotension , renal failure , and death .
When pregnancy is detected , discontinue losartan as soon as possible .
These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy .
Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin - angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents .
Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus .
In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin - angiotensin system for a particular patient , apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus .
Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra - amniotic environment .
If oligohydramnios is observed , discontinue losartan potassium , unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother .
Fetal testing may be appropriate , based on the week of pregnancy .
Patients and physicians should be aware , however , that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury .
Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to losartan potassium for hypotension , oliguria , and hyperkalemia [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Losartan potassium has been shown to produce adverse effects in rat fetuses and neonates , including decreased body weight , delayed physical and behavioral development , mortality and renal toxicity .
With the exception of neonatal weight gain ( which was affected at doses as low as 10 mg / kg / day ) , doses associated with these effects exceeded 25 mg / kg / day ( approximately three times the maximum recommended human dose of 100 mg on a mg / m2 basis ) .
These findings are attributed to drug exposure in late gestation and during lactation .
Significant levels of losartan and its active metabolite were shown to be present in rat fetal plasma during late gestation and in rat milk .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether losartan is excreted in human milk , but significant levels of losartan and its active metabolite were shown to be present in rat milk .
Because of the potential for adverse effects on the nursing infant , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to losartan potassium : If oliguria or hypotension occurs , direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion .
Exchange transfusion or dialysis may be required as means of reversing hypotension and / or substituting for disordered renal function .
Antihypertensive effects of losartan potassium have been established in hypertensive pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years .
Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients under the age of 6 or in pediatric patients with glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients receiving losartan potassium in controlled clinical studies for hypertension , 391 patients ( 19 % ) were 65 years and over , while 37 patients ( 2 % ) were 75 years and over .
In a controlled clinical study for renal protection in type 2 diabetic patients with proteinuria , 248 patients ( 33 % ) were 65 years and over .
In a controlled clinical study for the reduction in the combined risk of cardiovascular death , stroke and myocardial infarction in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy , 2857 patients ( 62 % ) were 65 years and over , while 808 patients ( 18 % ) were 75 years and over .
No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
8 . 6 Race In the LIFE study , Black patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy treated with atenolol were at lower risk of experiencing the primary composite endpoint compared with Black patients treated with losartan potassium ( both cotreated with hydrochlorothiazide in the majority of patients ) .
The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of stroke , myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death , analyzed using an intention - to - treat ( ITT ) approach .
In the subgroup of Black patients ( n = 533 , 6 % of the LIFE study patients ) , there were 29 primary endpoints among 263 patients on atenolol ( 11 % , 26 per 1000 patient - years ) and 46 primary endpoints among 270 patients ( 17 % , 42 per 1000 patient - years ) on losartan potassium .
This finding could not be explained on the basis of differences in the populations other than race or on any imbalances between treatment groups .
In addition , blood pressure reductions in both treatment groups were consistent between Black and non - Black patients .
Given the difficulty in interpreting subset differences in large trials , it cannot be known whether the observed difference is the result of chance .
However , the LIFE study provides no evidence that the benefits of losartan potassium on reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy apply to Black patients [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment Patients with renal insufficiency have elevated plasma concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite compared to subjects with normal renal function .
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment unless a patient with renal impairment is also volume depleted [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 8 Hepatic Impairment The recommended starting dose of losartan potassium is 25 mg in patients with mild - to - moderate hepatic impairment .
Following oral administration in patients with mild - to - moderate hepatic impairment , plasma concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite were , respectively , 5 times and 1 . 7 times those seen in healthy volunteers .
Losartan potassium has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Significant lethality was observed in mice and rats after oral administration of 1000 mg / kg and 2000 mg / kg , respectively , about 44 and 170 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis .
Limited data are available in regard to overdosage in humans .
The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension and tachycardia ; bradycardia could occur from parasympathetic ( vagal ) stimulation .
If symptomatic hypotension should occur , supportive treatment should be instituted .
Neither losartan nor its active metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis .
11 DESCRIPTION Losartan potassium tablets are an angiotensin II receptor blocker acting on the AT1 receptor subtype .
Losartan potassium , a non - peptide molecule , is chemically described as 2 - butyl - 4 - chloro - 1 - [ p - ( o - 1 H - tetrazol - 5 - ylphenyl ) benzyl ] imidazole - 5 - methanol monopotassium salt .
Its molecular formula is C22H22ClKN6O , and its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Losartan potassium USP is a white to off - white powder with a molecular weight of 461 . 01 .
It is freely soluble in water , soluble in alcohols , and slightly soluble in common organic solvents , such as acetonitrile and methyl ethyl ketone .
Oxidation of the 5 - hydroxymethyl group on the imidazole ring results in the active metabolite of losartan .
Losartan potassium is available as tablets for oral administration containing either 25 mg , 50 mg or 100 mg of losartan potassium and the following inactive ingredients : microcrystalline cellulose , lactose monohydrate , pregelatinized starch ( maize ) , low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose , magnesium stearate , hydroxypropyl cellulose , hypromellose 6 cP , titanium dioxide , FD & C blue # 2 / indigo carmine aluminum lake , D & C yellow # 10 aluminum lake , and purified water .
Losartan potassium tablets USP , 25 mg , 50 mg and 100 mg contain potassium in the following amounts : 2 . 12 mg ( 0 . 054 mEq ) , 4 . 24 mg ( 0 . 108 mEq ) and 8 . 48 mg ( 0 . 216 mEq ) , respectively .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Angiotensin II [ formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE , kininase II ) ] is a potent vasoconstrictor , the primary vasoactive hormone of the renin - angiotensin system , and an important component in the pathophysiology of hypertension .
It also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex .
Losartan and its principal active metabolite block the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone - secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor found in many tissues , ( e . g . , vascular smooth muscle , adrenal gland ) .
There is also an AT2 receptor found in many tissues but it is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis .
Neither losartan nor its principal active metabolite exhibits any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor , and both have much greater affinity ( about 1000 - fold ) for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor .
In vitro binding studies indicate that losartan is a reversible , competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor .
The active metabolite is 10 to 40 times more potent by weight than losartan and appears to be a reversible , non - competitive inhibitor of the AT1 receptor .
Neither losartan nor its active metabolite inhibits ACE ( kininase II , the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degrades bradykinin ) , nor do they bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Losartan inhibits the pressor effect of angiotensin II ( as well as angiotensin I ) infusions .
A dose of 100 mg inhibits the pressor effect by about 85 % at peak with 25 to 40 % inhibition persisting for 24 hours .
Removal of the negative feedback of angiotensin II causes a doubling to tripling in plasma renin activity and consequent rise in angiotensin II plasma concentration in hypertensive patients .
Losartan does not affect the response to bradykinin , whereas ACE inhibitors increase the response to bradykinin .
Aldosterone plasma concentrations fall following losartan administration .
In spite of the effect of losartan on aldosterone secretion , very little effect on serum potassium was observed .
The effect of losartan is substantially present within one week but in some studies the maximal effect occurred in 3 to 6 weeks .
In long - term follow - up studies ( without placebo control ) the effect of losartan appeared to be maintained for up to a year .
There is no apparent rebound effect after abrupt withdrawal of losartan .
There was essentially no change in average heart rate in losartan - treated patients in controlled trials .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption : Following oral administration , losartan is well absorbed and undergoes substantial first - pass metabolism .
The systemic bioavailability of losartan is approximately 33 % .
Mean peak concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite are reached in 1 hour and in 3 to 4 hours , respectively .
While maximum plasma concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite are approximately equal , the AUC ( area under the curve ) of the metabolite is about 4 times as great as that of losartan .
A meal slows absorption of losartan and decreases its Cmax but has only minor effects on losartan AUC or on the AUC of the metabolite ( ~ 10 % decrease ) .
The pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite are linear with oral losartan doses up to 200 mg and do not change over time .
Distribution : The volume of distribution of losartan and the active metabolite is about 34 liters and 12 liters , respectively .
Both losartan and its active metabolite are highly bound to plasma proteins , primarily albumin , with plasma free fractions of 1 . 3 % and 0 . 2 % , respectively .
Plasma protein binding is constant over the concentration range achieved with recommended doses .
Studies in rats indicate that losartan crosses the blood - brain barrier poorly , if at all .
Metabolism : Losartan is an orally active agent that undergoes substantial first - pass metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes .
It is converted , in part , to an active carboxylic acid metabolite that is responsible for most of the angiotensin II receptor antagonism that follows losartan treatment .
About 14 % of an orally - administered dose of losartan is converted to the active metabolite .
In addition to the active carboxylic acid metabolite , several inactive metabolites are formed .
In vitro studies indicate that cytochrome P450 2C9 and 3A4 are involved in the biotransformation of losartan to its metabolites .
Elimination : Total plasma clearance of losartan and the active metabolite is about 600 mL / min and 50 mL / min , respectively , with renal clearance of about 75 mL / min and 25 mL / min , respectively .
The terminal half - life of losartan is about 2 hours and of the metabolite is about 6 to 9 hours .
After single doses of losartan administered orally , about 4 % of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine and about 6 % is excreted in urine as active metabolite .
Biliary excretion contributes to the elimination of losartan and its metabolites .
Following oral 14 C - labeled losartan , about 35 % of radioactivity is recovered in the urine and about 60 % in the feces .
Following an intravenous dose of 14 C - labeled losartan , about 45 % of radioactivity is recovered in the urine and 50 % in the feces .
Neither losartan nor its metabolite accumulates in plasma upon repeated once - daily dosing .
Special Populations Pediatric : Pharmacokinetic parameters after multiple doses of losartan ( average dose 0 . 7 mg / kg , range 0 . 36 to 0 . 97 mg / kg ) as a tablet to 25 hypertensive patients aged 6 to 16 years are shown in Table 4 below .
Pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite were generally similar across the studied age groups and similar to historical pharmacokinetic data in adults .
The principal pharmacokinetic parameters in adults and children are shown in the table below .
Table 2 : Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Hypertensive Adults and Children Age 6 to 16 Following Multiple Dosing * Mean ± standard deviation † Harmonic mean and standard deviation ‡ Median Adults given 50 mg once daily for 7 days N = 12 Age 6 to 16 given 0 . 7 mg / kg once daily for 7 days N = 25 Parent Active Metabolite Parent Active Metabolite AUC0 - 24 ( ng • hr / mL ) * 442 ± 173 1685 ± 452 368 ± 169 1866 ± 1076 CMAX ( ng / mL ) * 224 ± 82 212 ± 73 141 ± 88 222 ± 127 T1 / 2 ( h ) † 2 . 1 ± 0 . 70 7 . 4 ± 2 . 4 2 . 3 ± 0 . 8 5 . 6 ± 1 . 2 TPEAK ( h ) ‡ 0 . 9 3 . 5 2 . 0 4 . 1 CLREN ( mL / min ) * 56 ± 23 20 ± 3 53 ± 33 17 ± 8 The bioavailability of the suspension formulation was compared with losartan tablets in healthy adults .
The suspension and tablet are similar in their bioavailability with respect to both losartan and the active metabolite [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Geriatric and Gender : Losartan pharmacokinetics have been investigated in the elderly ( 65 to 75 years ) and in both genders .
Plasma concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite are similar in elderly and young hypertensives .
Plasma concentrations of losartan were about twice as high in female hypertensives as male hypertensives , but concentrations of the active metabolite were similar in males and females .
No dosage adjustment is necessary [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Race : Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Renal Insufficiency : Following oral administration , plasma concentrations and AUCs of losartan and its active metabolite are increased by 50 to 90 % in patients with mild ( creatinine clearance of 50 to 74 mL / min ) or moderate ( creatinine clearance 30 to 49 mL / min ) renal insufficiency .
In this study , renal clearance was reduced by 55 to 85 % for both losartan and its active metabolite in patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency .
Neither losartan nor its active metabolite can be removed by hemodialysis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Hepatic Insufficiency : Following oral administration in patients with mild to moderate alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver , plasma concentrations of losartan and its active metabolite were , respectively , 5 - times and about 1 . 7 - times those in young male volunteers .
Compared to normal subjects the total plasma clearance of losartan in patients with hepatic insufficiency was about 50 % lower and the oral bioavailability was about doubled .
Use a starting dose of 25 mg for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
Losartan potassium has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 8 ) ] .
Drug Interactions No clinically significant drug interactions have been found in studies of losartan potassium with hydrochlorothiazide , digoxin , warfarin , cimetidine and phenobarbital .
However , rifampin has been shown to decrease the AUC of losartan and its active metabolite by 30 % and 40 % , respectively .
Fluconazole , an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C9 , decreased the AUC of the active metabolite by approximately 40 % , but increased the AUC of losartan by approximately 70 % following multiple doses .
Conversion of losartan to its active metabolite after intravenous administration is not affected by ketoconazole , an inhibitor of P450 3A4 .
The AUC of active metabolite following oral losartan was not affected by erythromycin , an inhibitor of P450 3A4 , but the AUC of losartan was increased by 30 % .
The pharmacodynamic consequences of concomitant use of losartan and inhibitors of P450 2C9 have not been examined .
Subjects who do not metabolize losartan to active metabolite have been shown to have a specific , rare defect in cytochrome P450 2C9 .
These data suggest that the conversion of losartan to its active metabolite is mediated primarily by P450 2C9 and not P450 3A4 .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Losartan potassium was not carcinogenic when administered at maximally tolerated dosages to rats and mice for 105 and 92 weeks , respectively .
Female rats given the highest dose ( 270 mg / kg / day ) had a slightly higher incidence of pancreatic acinar adenoma .
The maximally tolerated dosages ( 270 mg / kg / day in rats , 200 mg / kg / day in mice ) provided systemic exposures for losartan and its pharmacologically active metabolite that were approximately 160 and 90 times ( rats ) and 30 and 15 times ( mice ) the exposure of a 50 kg human given 100 mg per day .
Losartan potassium was negative in the microbial mutagenesis and V - 79 mammalian cell mutagenesis assays and in the in vitro alkaline elution and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal aberration assays .
In addition , the active metabolite showed no evidence of genotoxicity in the microbial mutagenesis , in vitro alkaline elution , and in vitro chromosomal aberration assays .
Fertility and reproductive performance were not affected in studies with male rats given oral doses of losartan potassium up to approximately 150 mg / kg / day .
The administration of toxic dosage levels in females ( 300 / 200 mg / kg / day ) was associated with a significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) decrease in the number of corpora lutea / female , implants / female , and live fetuses / female at C - section .
At 100 mg / kg / day only a decrease in the number of corpora lutea / female was observed .
The relationship of these findings to drug - treatment is uncertain since there was no effect at these dosage levels on implants / pregnant female , percent post - implantation loss , or live animals / litter at parturition .
In nonpregnant rats dosed at 135 mg / kg / day for 7 days , systemic exposure ( AUCs ) for losartan and its active metabolite were approximately 66 and 26 times the exposure achieved in man at the maximum recommended human daily dosage ( 100 mg ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Hypertension Adult Hypertension The antihypertensive effects of losartan potassium were demonstrated principally in 4 placebo - controlled , 6 - to 12 - week trials of dosages from 10 to 150 mg per day in patients with baseline diastolic blood pressures of 95 to 115 .
The studies allowed comparisons of two doses ( 50 to 100 mg / day ) as once - daily or twice - daily regimens , comparisons of peak and trough effects , and comparisons of response by gender , age , and race .
Three additional studies examined the antihypertensive effects of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide in combination .
The 4 studies of losartan monotherapy included a total of 1075 patients randomized to several doses of losartan and 334 to placebo .
The 10 and 25 mg doses produced some effect at peak ( 6 hours after dosing ) but small and inconsistent trough ( 24 hour ) responses .
Doses of 50 , 100 and 150 mg once daily gave statistically significant systolic / diastolic mean decreases in blood pressure , compared to placebo in the range of 5 . 5 to 10 . 5 / 3 . 5 to 7 . 5 mmHg , with the 150 mg dose giving no greater effect than 50 to 100 mg .
Twice - daily dosing at 50 to 100 mg / day gave consistently larger trough responses than once - daily dosing at the same total dose .
Peak ( 6 hour ) effects were uniformly , but moderately , larger than trough effects , with the trough - to - peak ratio for systolic and diastolic responses 50 to 95 % and 60 to 90 % , respectively .
Addition of a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide ( 12 . 5 mg ) to losartan 50 mg once daily resulted in placebo - adjusted blood pressure reductions of 15 . 5 / 9 . 2 mmHg .
Analysis of age , gender , and race subgroups of patients showed that men and women , and patients over and under 65 , had generally similar responses .
Losartan potassium was effective in reducing blood pressure regardless of race , although the effect was somewhat less in Black patients ( usually a low - renin population ) .
Pediatric Hypertension The antihypertensive effect of losartan was studied in one trial enrolling 177 hypertensive pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years old .
Children who weighed < 50 kg received 2 . 5 , 25 or 50 mg of losartan daily and patients who weighed ≥ 50 kg received 5 , 50 or 100 mg of losartan daily .
Children in the lowest dose group were given losartan in a suspension formulation [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
The majority of the children had hypertension associated with renal and urogenital disease .
The sitting diastolic blood pressure ( SiDBP ) on entry into the study was higher than the 95 th percentile level for the patient ’ s age , gender , and height .
At the end of three weeks , losartan reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure , measured at trough , in a dose - dependent manner .
Overall , the two higher doses ( 25 to 50 mg in patients < 50 kg ; 50 to 100 mg in patients ≥ 50 kg ) reduced diastolic blood pressure by 5 to 6 mmHg more than the lowest dose used ( 2 . 5 mg in patients < 50 kg ; 5 mg in patients ≥ 50 kg ) .
The lowest dose , corresponding to an average daily dose of 0 . 07 mg / kg , did not appear to offer consistent antihypertensive efficacy .
When patients were randomized to continue losartan at the two higher doses or to placebo after 3 weeks of therapy , trough diastolic blood pressure rose in patients on placebo between 5 and 7 mmHg more than patients randomized to continuing losartan .
When the low dose of losartan was randomly withdrawn , the rise in trough diastolic blood pressure was the same in patients receiving placebo and in those continuing losartan , again suggesting that the lowest dose did not have significant antihypertensive efficacy .
Overall , no significant differences in the overall antihypertensive effect of losartan were detected when the patients were analyzed according to age ( < , ≥ 12 years old ) or gender .
While blood pressure was reduced in all racial subgroups examined , too few non - White patients were enrolled to compare the dose - response of losartan in the non - White subgroup .
14 . 2 Hypertensive Patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy The LIFE study was a multinational , double - blind study comparing losartan potassium and atenolol in 9193 hypertensive patients with ECG - documented left ventricular hypertrophy .
Patients with myocardial infarction or stroke within six months prior to randomization were excluded .
Patients were randomized to receive once daily losartan potassium 50 mg or atenolol 50 mg .
If goal blood pressure ( < 140 / 90 mmHg ) was not reached , hydrochlorothiazide ( 12 . 5 mg ) was added first and , if needed , the dose of losartan potassium or atenolol was then increased to 100 mg once daily .
If necessary , other antihypertensive treatments ( e . g . , increase in dose of hydrochlorothiazide therapy to 25 mg or addition of other diuretic therapy , calcium - channel blockers , alpha - blockers , or centrally acting agents , but not ACE inhibitors , angiotensin II antagonists , or beta - blockers ) were added to the treatment regimen to reach the goal blood pressure .
Of the randomized patients , 4963 ( 54 % ) were female and 533 ( 6 % ) were Black .
The mean age was 67 with 5704 ( 62 % ) age ≥ 65 .
At baseline , 1195 ( 13 % ) had diabetes , 1326 ( 14 % ) had isolated systolic hypertension , 1469 ( 16 % ) had coronary heart disease , and 728 ( 8 % ) had cerebrovascular disease .
Baseline mean blood pressure was 174 / 98 mmHg in both treatment groups .
The mean length of follow - up was 4 . 8 years .
At the end of study or at the last visit before a primary endpoint , 77 % of the group treated with losartan potassium and 73 % of the group treated with atenolol were still taking study medication .
Of the patients still taking study medication , the mean doses of losartan potassium and atenolol were both about 80 mg / day , and 15 % were taking atenolol or losartan as monotherapy , while 77 % were also receiving hydrochlorothiazide ( at a mean dose of 20 mg / day in each group ) .
Blood pressure reduction measured at trough was similar for both treatment groups but blood pressure was not measured at any other time of the day .
At the end of study or at the last visit before a primary endpoint , the mean blood pressures were 144 . 1 / 81 . 3 mmHg for the group treated with losartan potassium and 145 . 4 / 80 . 9 mmHg for the group treated with atenolol ; the difference in systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) of 1 . 3 mmHg was significant ( p < 0 . 001 ) , while the difference of 0 . 4 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) was not significant ( p = 0 . 098 ) .
The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of cardiovascular death , nonfatal stroke , or nonfatal myocardial infarction .
Patients with nonfatal events remained in the trial , so that there was also an examination of the first event of each type even if it was not the first event ( e . g . , a stroke following an initial myocardial infarction would be counted in the analysis of stroke ) .
Treatment with losartan potassium resulted in a 13 % reduction ( p = 0 . 021 ) in risk of the primary endpoint compared to the atenolol group ( see Figure 1 and Table 3 ) ; this difference was primarily the result of an effect on fatal and nonfatal stroke .
Treatment with losartan potassium reduced the risk of stroke by 25 % relative to atenolol ( p = 0 . 001 ) ( see Figure 2 and Table 3 ) .

Table 3 shows the results for the primary composite endpoint and the individual endpoints .
The primary endpoint was the first occurrence of stroke , myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death , analyzed using an ITT approach .
The table shows the number of events for each component in two different ways .
The Components of Primary Endpoint ( as a first event ) counts only the events that define the primary endpoint , while the Secondary Endpoints count all first events of a particular type , whether or not they were preceded by a different type of event .

Although not measured directly , the difference between losartan potassium and placebo is compelling because there is evidence that atenolol is itself effective ( vs . placebo ) in reducing cardiovascular events , including stroke , in hypertensive patients .
Other clinical endpoints of the LIFE study were : total mortality , hospitalization for heart failure or angina pectoris , coronary or peripheral revascularization procedures , and resuscitated cardiac arrest .
There were no significant differences in the rates of these endpoints between the losartan potassium and atenolol groups .
For the primary endpoint and stroke , the effects of losartan potassium in patient subgroups defined by age , gender , race and presence or absence of isolated systolic hypertension ( ISH ) , diabetes , and history of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) are shown in Figure 3 below .
Subgroup analyses can be difficult to interpret and it is not known whether these represent true differences or chance effects .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 3 Nephropathy in Type 2 Diabetic Patients The RENAAL study was a randomized , placebo - controlled , double - blind , multicenter study conducted worldwide in 1513 patients with type 2 diabetes with nephropathy ( defined as serum creatinine 1 . 3 to 3 . 0 mg / dL in females or males ≤ 60 kg and 1 . 5 to 3 . 0 mg / dL in males > 60 kg and proteinuria [ urinary albumin to creatinine ratio ≥ 300 mg / g ] ) .
Patients were randomized to receive losartan potassium 50 mg once daily or placebo on a background of conventional antihypertensive therapy excluding ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists .
After one month , investigators were instructed to titrate study drug to 100 mg once daily if the trough blood pressure goal ( 140 / 90 mmHg ) was not achieved .
Overall , 72 % of patients received the 100 mg daily dose more than 50 % of the time they were on study drug .
Because the study was designed to achieve equal blood pressure control in both groups , other antihypertensive agents ( diuretics , calcium - channel blockers , alpha - or beta - blockers , and centrally acting agents ) could be added as needed in both groups .
Patients were followed for a mean duration of 3 . 4 years .
The study population was diverse with regard to race ( Asian 16 . 7 % , Black 15 . 2 % , Hispanic 18 . 3 % , White 48 . 6 % ) .
Overall , 63 . 2 % of the patients were men , and 66 . 4 % were under the age of 65 years .
Almost all of the patients ( 96 . 6 % ) had a history of hypertension , and the patients entered the trial with a mean serum creatinine of 1 . 9 mg / dL and mean proteinuria ( urinary albumin / creatinine ) of 1808 mg / g at baseline .
The primary endpoint of the study was the time to first occurrence of any one of the following events : doubling of serum creatinine , end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) ( need for dialysis or transplantation ) , or death .
Treatment with losartan potassium resulted in a 16 % risk reduction in this endpoint ( see Figure 4 and Table 4 ) .
Treatment with losartan potassium also reduced the occurrence of sustained doubling of serum creatinine by 25 % and ESRD by 29 % as separate endpoints , but had no effect on overall mortality ( see Table 4 ) .
The mean baseline blood pressures were 152 / 82 mmHg for losartan potassium plus conventional antihypertensive therapy and 153 / 82 mmHg for placebo plus conventional antihypertensive therapy .
At the end of the study , the mean blood pressures were 143 / 76 mmHg for the group treated with losartan potassium and 146 / 77 mmHg for the group treated with placebo .

Compared with placebo , losartan potassium significantly reduced proteinuria by an average of 34 % , an effect that was evident within 3 months of starting therapy , and significantly reduced the rate of decline in glomerular filtration rate during the study by 13 % , as measured by the reciprocal of the serum creatinine concentration .
There was no significant difference in the incidence of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality .
The favorable effects of losartan potassium were seen in patients also taking other anti - hypertensive medications ( angiotensin II receptor antagonists and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors were not allowed ) , oral hypoglycemic agents and lipid - lowering agents .
For the primary endpoint and ESRD , the effects of losartan potassium in patient subgroups defined by age , gender and race are shown in Table 5 below .
Subgroup analyses can be difficult to interpret and it is not known whether these represent true differences or chance effects .

What is the most important information I should know about losartan potassium tablets ?
• • Losartan potassium tablets can cause harm or death to an unborn baby .
• • Talk to your doctor about other ways to lower your blood pressure if you plan to become pregnant .
• • If you get pregnant while taking losartan potassium tablets , tell your doctor right away .
What are losartan potassium tablets ?
Losartan potassium tablets is a prescription medicine called an angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) .
It is used : • • alone or with other blood pressure medicines to lower high blood pressure ( hypertension ) .
• • to lower the chance of stroke in patients with high blood pressure and a heart problem called left ventricular hypertrophy .
Losartan potassium tablets may not help Black patients with this problem .
• • to slow the worsening of diabetic kidney disease ( nephropathy ) in patients with type 2 diabetes who have or had high blood pressure .
Losartan potassium tablets have not been studied in children less than 6 years old or in children with certain kidney problems .
High Blood Pressure ( hypertension ) .
Blood pressure is the force in your blood vessels when your heart beats and when your heart rests .
You have high blood pressure when the force is too much .
Losartan potassium tablets can help your blood vessels relax so your blood pressure is lower .
Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ( LVH ) is an enlargement of the walls of the left chamber of the heart ( the heart ’ s main pumping chamber ) .
LVH can happen from several things .
High blood pressure is the most common cause of LVH .
Type 2 Diabetes with Nephropathy .
Type 2 diabetes is a type of diabetes that happens mainly in adults .
If you have diabetic nephropathy it means that your kidneys do not work properly because of damage from the diabetes .
Who should not take losartan potassium tablets ?
• • Do not take losartan potassium tablets if you are allergic to any of the ingredients in losartan potassium tablets .
