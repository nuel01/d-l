Rx Only DESCRIPTION The product is a clear , colorless solution containing Citric Acid USP 640 mg / 5 mL , and Hydrous Sodium Citrate USP 490 mg / 5 mL .
It also contains Methylparaben NF and Propylparaben NF as preservatives .
These concentrations yield 1 mEq of sodium , equivalent to 1 mEq of bicarbonate per mL of solution .
ACTION Oral citrate solution is used as a systemic and urinary alkalinizer .
Less than 5 % of the citrate is excreted in the urine unchanged , since citrate oxidation is to a great extent complete .
INDICATIONS ORACIT ® is indicated for the treatment of metabolic acidosis .
This solution is also useful in conditions where long term maintenance of alkaline urine is needed ( e . g . uric acid and cystine calculi of the urinary tract ) .
ORACIT ® is also effective in treatment for acidosis of certain renal tubular disorders .
CONTRAINDICATIONS ORACIT ® is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment , oliguria or azotemia , untreated Addison ' s disease , adynamia episodica hereditaria , acute dehydration , heat cramp , anuria , severe myocardial damage , and hyperkalemia .
PRECAUTIONS The citrate solution should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function to avoid hypernatremia or alkalosis in the presence of hypocalcemia .
Periodic determinations of serum electrolyte levels ( especially bicarbonate levels ) should be done in patients with renal disease to avoid cardiac failure , hypertension , peripheral and pulmonary edema , and toxemia of pregnancy .
The solution should be diluted with water and preferably taken after meals to avoid saline laxative effects .
