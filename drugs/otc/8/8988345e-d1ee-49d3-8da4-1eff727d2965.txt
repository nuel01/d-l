1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release , a CNS stimulant , is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
( 1 ) • Children ( ages 6 to 12 ) : Efficacy was established in one 3 - week outpatient , controlled trial and one analogue classroom , controlled trial in children with ADHD .
( 14 ) • Adolescents ( ages 13 to 17 ) : Efficacy was established in one 4 - week controlled trial in adolescents with ADHD .
( 14 ) • Adults : Efficacy was established in one 4 - week controlled trial in adults with ADHD .
( 14 ) 1 . 1 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
The efficacy of Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release in the treatment of ADHD was established on the basis of two controlled trials in children aged 6 to 12 , one controlled trial in adolescents aged 13 to 17 , and one controlled trial in adults who met DSM - IV ® criteria for ADHD [ see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14 ) ] .
A diagnosis of ADHD ( DSM - IV ® ) implies the presence of hyperactive - impulsive or inattentive symptoms that caused impairment and were present before age 7 years .
The symptoms must cause clinically significant impairment , e . g . , in social , academic , or occupational functioning , and be present in two or more settings , e . g . , school ( or work ) and at home .
The symptoms must not be better accounted for by another mental disorder .
For the Inattentive Type , at least six of the following symptoms must have persisted for at least 6 months : lack of attention to details / careless mistakes ; lack of sustained attention ; poor listener ; failure to follow through on tasks ; poor organization ; avoids tasks requiring sustained mental effort ; loses things ; easily distracted ; forgetful .
For the Hyperactive - Impulsive Type , at least six of the following symptoms must have persisted for at least 6 months : fidgeting / squirming ; leaving seat ; inappropriate running / climbing ; difficulty with quiet activities ; " on the go ; " excessive talking ; blurting answers ; ca n't wait turn ; intrusive .
The Combined Type requires both inattentive and hyperactive - impulsive criteria to be met .
Special Diagnostic Considerations Specific etiology of this syndrome is unknown , and there is no single diagnostic test .
Adequate diagnosis requires the use not only of medical but of special psychological , educational , and social resources .
Learning may or may not be impaired .
The diagnosis must be based upon a complete history and evaluation of the patient and not solely on the presence of the required number of DSM - IV ® characteristics .
Need for Comprehensive Treatment Program Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release is indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for ADHD that may include other measures ( psychological , educational , social ) for patients with this syndrome .
Drug treatment may not be indicated for all patients with this syndrome .
Stimulants are not intended for use in the patient who exhibits symptoms secondary to environmental factors and / or other primary psychiatric disorders , including psychosis .
Appropriate educational placement is essential and psychosocial intervention is often helpful .
When remedial measures alone are insufficient , the decision to prescribe stimulant medication will depend upon the physician ' s assessment of the chronicity and severity of the child ' s symptoms .
Long - Term Use The effectiveness of Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release for long - term use , i . e . , for more than 3 weeks in children and 4 weeks in adolescents and adults , has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials .
Therefore , the physician who elects to use Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release for extended periods should periodically re - evaluate the long - term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient .

Hypersensitivity reactions such as angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients treated with other amphetamine products [ see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 . 2 ) ] • Glaucoma • Agitated states • History of drug abuse • Patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) , or within 14 days of stopping MAOIs ( including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue ) , because of an increased risk of hypertensive crisis [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 6 ) and DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7 . 1 ) ] • Advanced arteriosclerosis ( 4 ) • Symptomatic cardiovascular disease ( 4 ) • Moderate to severe hypertension ( 4 ) • Hyperthyroidism ( 4 ) • Known hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to amphetamine ( 4 ) • Glaucoma ( 4 ) • Agitated states ( 4 ) • History of drug abuse ( 4 ) • During or within 14 days following the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) ( 4 , 7 . 1 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Serious Cardiovascular Reactions : Sudden death has been reported with usual doses of CNS stimulants in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems ; sudden death , stroke , and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking CNS stimulants at usual doses .
Stimulant drugs should not be used in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities , cardiomyopathy , serious heart rhythm abnormalities , coronary artery disease , or other serious heart problems .
( 5 . 1 ) • Increase in Blood Pressure : Monitor blood pressure and pulse at appropriate intervals .
Use with caution in patients for whom blood pressure increases may be problematic .
( 5 . 2 ) • Psychiatric Adverse Events : Stimulants may cause treatment - emergent psychotic or manic symptoms in patients with no prior history , or exacerbation of symptoms in patients with pre - existing psychosis .
Evaluate for bipolar disorder prior to stimulant use .
Monitor for aggressive behavior .
( 5 . 3 ) • Long - Term Suppression of Growth : Monitor height and weight at appropriate intervals .
( 5 . 4 ) • Seizures : May lower the convulsive threshold .
Discontinue in the presence of seizures .
( 5 . 5 ) • Peripheral Vasculopathy , including Raynaud ’ s phenomenon : Stimulants used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy , including Raynaud ’ s phenomenon .
Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants .
( 5 . 6 ) • Serotonin Syndrome : Increased risk when coadministered with serotonergic agents ( e . g . , SSRIs , SNRIs , triptans ) , but also during overdosage situations .
If it occurs , discontinue Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release and initiate supportive treatment ( 4 , 5 . 7 , 10 ) .
• Visual Disturbance : Difficulties with accommodation and blurring of vision have been reported with stimulant treatment .
( 5 . 8 ) • Tics : May exacerbate tics .
Evaluate for tics and Tourette ’ s syndrome prior to stimulant administration .
( 5 . 9 ) 5 . 1 Potential for Abuse and Dependence CNS stimulants , including Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release capsules , other amphetamine - containing products , and methylphenidate , have a high potential for abuse and dependence .
Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing , and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy [ see Boxed Warning , Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 . 2 , 9 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 2 Serious Cardiovascular Events Sudden Death and Pre - existing Structural Cardiac Abnormalities or Other Serious Heart Problems Children and Adolescents Sudden death has been reported in association with CNS stimulant treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems .
Although some serious heart problems alone carry an increased risk of sudden death , stimulant products generally should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities , cardiomyopathy , serious heart rhythm abnormalities , or other serious cardiac problems that may place them at increased vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant drug [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ] .
Adults Sudden deaths , stroke , and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking stimulant drugs at usual doses for ADHD .
Although the role of stimulants in these adult cases is also unknown , adults have a greater likelihood than children of having serious structural cardiac abnormalities , cardiomyopathy , serious heart rhythm abnormalities , coronary artery disease , or other serious cardiac problems .
Adults with such abnormalities should also generally not be treated with stimulant drugs [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ] .
Hypertension and Other Cardiovascular Conditions Stimulant medications cause a modest increase in average blood pressure ( about 2 to 4 mmHg ) and average heart rate ( about 3 to 6 bpm ) , and individuals may have larger increases .
While the mean changes alone would not be expected to have short - term consequences , all patients should be monitored for larger changes in heart rate and blood pressure .
Caution is indicated in treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure or heart rate , e . g . , those with pre - existing hypertension , heart failure , recent myocardial infarction , or ventricular arrhythmia [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) and ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 ) ] .
Assessing Cardiovascular Status in Patients being Treated with Stimulant Medications Children , adolescents , or adults who are being considered for treatment with stimulant medications should have a careful history ( including assessment for a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia ) and physical exam to assess for the presence of cardiac disease , and should receive further cardiac evaluation if findings suggest such disease ( e . g . electrocardiogram and echocardiogram ) .
Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain , unexplained syncope , or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during stimulant treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation .
5 . 3 Psychiatric Adverse Events Pre - Existing Adverse Events Administration of stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with pre - existing psychotic disorder .
Bipolar Illness Particular care should be taken in using stimulants to treat ADHD patients with comorbid bipolar disorder because of concern for possible induction of mixed / manic episode in such patients .
Prior to initiating treatment with a stimulant , patients with comorbid depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder ; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history , including a family history of suicide , bipolar disorder , and depression .
Emergence of New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms Treatment - emergent psychotic or manic symptoms , e . g . , hallucinations , delusional thinking , or mania in children and adolescents without prior history of psychotic illness or mania can be caused by stimulants at usual doses .
If such symptoms occur , consideration should be given to a possible causal role of the stimulant , and discontinuation of treatment may be appropriate .
In a pooled analysis of multiple short - term , placebo - controlled studies , such symptoms occurred in about 0 . 1 % ( 4 patients with events out of 3482 exposed to methylphenidate or amphetamine for several weeks at usualdoses ) of stimulant - treated patients compared to 0 in placebo - treated patients .
Aggression Aggressive behavior or hostility is often observed in children and adolescents with ADHD , and has been reported in clinical trials and the postmarketing experience of some medications indicated for the treatment of ADHD .
Although there is no systematic evidence that stimulants cause aggressive behavior or hostility , patients beginning treatment for ADHD should be monitored for the appearance of or worsening of aggressive behavior or hostility .
5 . 4 Long - Term Suppression of Growth Monitor growth in children during treatment with stimulants .
Patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted .
Careful follow - up of weight and height in children ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non - medication treatment groups over 14 months , as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate - treated and non - medication treated children over 36 months ( to the ages of 10 to 13 years ) , suggests that consistently medicated children ( i . e . , treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year ) have a temporary slowing in growth rate ( on average , a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2 . 7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years ) , without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development .
In a controlled trial of Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release in adolescents , mean weight change from baseline within the initial 4 weeks of therapy was – 1 . 1 lbs .
and – 2 . 8 lbs . , respectively , for patients receiving 10 mg and 20 mg Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release .
Higher doses were associated with greater weight loss within the initial 4 weeks of treatment .
Chronic use of amphetamines can be expected to cause a similar suppression of growth .
5 . 5 Seizures There is some clinical evidence that stimulants may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with prior history of seizures , in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in the absence of seizures , and very rarely , in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures .
In the presence of seizures , Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release should be discontinued .
5 . 6 Peripheral Vasculopathy , including Raynaud ’ s Phenomenon Stimulants , includingDextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release , usedto treatADHDareassociatedwithperipheralvasculopathy , includingRaynaud ’ sphenomenon .

Furtherclinicalevaluation ( e . g . , rheumatologyreferral ) may beappropriateforcertainpatients .
5 . 7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome , a potentially life - threatening reaction , may occur when amphetamines are used in combination with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems such as MAOIs , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) , triptans , tricyclic antidepressants , fentanyl , lithium , tramadol , tryptophan , buspirone , and St . John ’ s Wort [ see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Amphetamines and amphetamine derivatives are known to be metabolized , to some degree , by cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ) and display minor inhibition of CYP2D6 metabolism [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction exists with the co - administration of CYP2D6 inhibitors which may increase the risk with increased exposure to Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release .
In these situations , consider an alternative non - serotonergic drug or an alternative drug that does not inhibit CYP2D6 [ see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes ( e . g . , agitation , hallucinations , delirium , and coma ) , autonomic instability ( e . g . , tachycardia , labile blood pressure , dizziness , diaphoresis , flushing , hyperthermia ) , neuromuscular symptoms ( e . g . , tremor , rigidity , myoclonus , hyperreflexia , incoordination ) , seizures , and / or gastrointestinal symptoms ( e . g . , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ) .
Concomitant use of Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release with MAOI drugs is contraindicated [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ] .
Discontinue treatment with Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if symptoms of serotonin syndrome occur , and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment .
Concomitant use of Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release with other serotonergic drugs or CYP2D6 inhibitors should be used only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk .
If clinically warranted , consider initiating Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release with lower doses , monitoring patients for the emergence of serotonin syndrome during drug initiation or titration , and informing patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome .
5 . 8 Visual Disturbance Difficulties with accommodation and blurring of vision have been reported with stimulant treatment .
5 . 9 Tics Amphetamines have been reported to exacerbate motor and phonic tics and Tourette ’ s syndrome .
Therefore , clinical evaluation for tics and Tourette ’ s syndrome in patients and their families should precede use of stimulant medications .
5 . 10 Prescribing and Dispensing The least amount of amphetamine feasible should be prescribed or dispensed at one time in order to minimize the possibility of overdosage .
Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release should be used with caution in patients who use other sympathomimetic drugs .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
• Children ( ages 6 to 12 ) : Most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 5 % and with a higher incidence than on placebo ) were loss of appetite , insomnia , abdominal pain , emotional lability , vomiting , nervousness , nausea , and fever .
( 6 . 1 ) • Adolescents ( ages 13 to 17 ) : Most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 5 % and with a higher incidence than on placebo ) were loss of appetite , insomnia , abdominal pain , weight loss , and nervousness .
( 6 . 1 ) • Adults : Most common adverse reactions ≥ 5 % and with a higher incidence than on placebo were dry mouth , loss of appetite , insomnia , headache , weight loss , nausea , anxiety , agitation , dizziness , tachycardia , diarrhea , asthenia , and urinary tract infections .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience The premarketing development program for Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release included exposures in a total of 1315 participants in clinical trials ( 635 pediatric patients , 350 adolescent patients , 248 adult patients , and 82 healthy adult subjects ) .
Of these , 635 patients ( ages 6 to 12 ) were evaluated in two controlled clinical studies , one open - label clinical study , and two single - dose clinical pharmacology studies ( N = 40 ) .
Safety data on all patients are included in the discussion that follows .
Adverse reactions were assessed by collecting adverse reactions , results of physical examinations , vital signs , weights , laboratory analyses , and ECGs .
Adverse reactions during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing .
Consequently , it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse reactions without first grouping similar types of reactions into a smaller number of standardized event categories .
In the tables and listings that follow , COSTART terminology has been used to classify reported adverse reactions .
The stated frequencies of adverse reactions represent the proportion of individuals who experienced , at least once , a treatment - emergent adverse event of the type listed .
Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment In two placebo - controlled studies of up to 5 weeks duration among children with ADHD , 2 . 4 % ( 10 / 425 ) of Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release - treated patients discontinued due to adverse reactions ( including 3 patients with loss of appetite , one of whom also reported insomnia ) compared to 2 . 7 % ( 7 / 259 ) receiving placebo .
The most frequent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release in controlled and uncontrolled , multiple - dose clinical trials of children ( N = 595 ) were anorexia ( loss of appetite ) ( 2 . 9 % ) , insomnia ( 1 . 5 % ) , weight loss ( 1 . 2 % ) , emotional lability ( 1 % ) , and depression ( 0 . 7 % ) .
Over half of these patients were exposed to Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release for 12 months or more .
In a separate placebo - controlled 4 - week study in adolescents with ADHD , five patients ( 2 . 1 % ) discontinued treatment due to adverse events among Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release - treated patients ( N = 233 ) compared to none who received placebo ( N = 54 ) .

( 8 . 1 ) • Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychostimulants at 1 - 866 - 961 - 2388 or visiting online at https : / / womensmentalhealth . org / clinical - and - research - programs / pregnancyregistry / othermedications / .
Risk Summary Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports on use of prescription amphetamine in pregnant women have not identified a drug - associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage ( see Data ) .
Adverse pregnancy outcomes , including premature delivery and low birth weight , have been seen in infants born to mothers taking amphetamines during pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
No apparent effects on morphological development were observed in embryo - fetal development studies , with oral administration of amphetamine to rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 2 and 12 times , respectively , the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 20 mg / day given to adolescents , on a mg / m2 basis .
However , in a pre - and post - natal development study , amphetamine ( d - to l - ratio of 3 : 1 ) administered orally to pregnant rats during gestation and lactation caused a decrease in pup survival and a decrease in pup body weight that correlated with a delay in developmental landmarks at clinically relevant doses of amphetamine .
In addition , adverse effects on reproductive performance were observed in pups whose mothers were treated with amphetamine .
Long - term neurochemical and behavioral effects have also been reported in animal developmental studies using clinically relevant doses of amphetamine ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Fetal / Neonatal Adverse Reactions Amphetamines , such as Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release , cause vasoconstriction and thereby may decrease placental perfusion .
In addition , amphetamines can stimulate uterine contractions , increasing the risk of premature delivery .
Infants born to mothers taking amphetamines during pregnancy have an increased risk of premature delivery and low birth weight .
Monitor infants born to mothers taking amphetamines for symptoms of withdrawal such as feeding difficulties , irritability , agitation , and excessive drowsiness .
Data Animal Data Amphetamine ( d - to l - enantiomer ratio of 3 : 1 ) had no apparent effects on embryofetal morphological development or survival when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout the period of organogenesis at doses of up to 6 and 16 mg / kg / day , respectively .
These doses are approximately 2 and 12 times , respectively , the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 20 mg / day given to adolescents , on a mg / m2 basis .
Fetal malformations and death have been reported in mice following parenteral administration of d - amphetamine doses of 50 mg / kg / day ( approximately 10 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg / m2 basis ) or greater to pregnant animals .
Administration of these doses was also associated with severe maternal toxicity .
A study was conducted in which pregnant rats received daily oral doses of amphetamine ( d - toll - enantiomer ratio of 3 : 1 ) , of 2 , 6 , and 10 mg / kg from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20 .
These doses are approximately 0 . 8 , 2 , and 4 times the MRHDof 20 mg / day given to adolescents , on a mg / m2 basis .
All doses caused hyperactivity and decreased weight gain in the dams .
A decrease in pup survival was seen at all doses .
A decrease in pup body weight was seen at 6 and 10 mg / kg which correlated with delays in developmental landmarks , such as preputial separation and vaginal opening .
Increased pup locomotor activity was seen at 10 mg / kg on day 22 postpartum but not at 5 weeks postweaning .
When pups were tested for reproductive performance at maturation , gestational weight gain , number of implantations , and number of delivered pups were decreased in the group whose mothers had been given 10 mg / kg .
A number of studies from the literature in rodents indicate that prenatal or early postnatal exposure to amphetamine ( d - or d , l - ) , at doses similar to those used clinically , can result in long - term neurochemical and behavioral alterations .
Reported behavioral effects include learning and memory deficits , altered locomotor activity , and changes in sexual function .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Based on limited case reports in published literature , amphetamine ( d - or d , l - ) is present in human milk , at relative infant doses of 2 % to 13 . 8 % of the maternal weight - adjusted dosage and a milk / plasma ratio ranging between 1 . 9 and 7 . 5 .
There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed infant .
Long - term neurodevelopmental effects on infants from amphetamine exposure are unknown .
It is possible that large dosages of amphetamine might interfere with milk production , especially in women whose lactation is not well established .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants , advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release is indicated for use in children 6 years of age and older .

Long - term effects of amphetamines in children have not been well established .
Long - Term Growth Suppression Growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants , including Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release , and pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Juvenile rats treated with mixed amphetamine salts early in the postnatal period through sexual maturation demonstrated transient changes in motor activity .
Learning and memory was impaired at approximately 6 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) given to children on a mg / m2 basis .
No recovery was seen following a drug free period .
A delay in sexual maturation was observed at a dose approximately 6 times the MRHD given to children on a mg / m2 basis , although there was no effect on fertility .
In a juvenile developmental study , rats received daily oral doses of amphetamine ( d to l enantiomer ratio of 3 : 1 ) of 2 , 6 , or 20 mg / kg on days 7 to 13 of age ; from day 14 to approximately day 60 of age these doses were given b . i . d . for total daily doses of 4 , 12 , or 40 mg / kg .
The latter doses are approximately 0 . 6 , 2 , and 6 times the MRHD of 30 mg / day given to children on a mg / m2 basis .
Post dosing hyperactivity was seen at all doses ; motor activity measured prior to the daily dose was decreased during the dosing period but the decreased motor activity was largely absent after an 18 day drug - free recovery period .
Performance in the Morris water maze test for learning and memory was impaired at the 40 mg / kg dose , and sporadically at the lower doses , when measured prior to the daily dose during the treatment period ; no recovery was seen after a 19 day drug - free period .
A delay in the developmental milestones of vaginal opening and preputial separation was seen at 40 mg / kg but there was no effect on fertility .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release has not been studied in the geriatric population .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Due to reduced clearance of amphetamines in patients with severe renal impairment ( GFR 15 to < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) , the recommended dose should be reduced .
Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release is not recommended in patients with ESRD ( GFR < 15 ml / min / 1 . 73m2 ) [ see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 5 ) , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Amphetamines are non - catecholamine sympathomimetic amines with CNS stimulant activity .
The mode of therapeutic action in ADHD is not known .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Amphetamines block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic studies of Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release have been conducted in healthy adult and pediatric ( children aged 6 to 12 yrs ) subjects , and adolescent ( 13 to 17 yrs ) and children with ADHD .
Both Dextroamphetamine sulfate , dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , amphetamine sulfate ( immediate - release ) tablets and Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release capsules contain d - amphetamine and l - amphetamine salts in the ratio of 3 : 1 .
Following administration of Dextroamphetamine sulfate , dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , amphetamine sulfate ( immediate - release ) , the peak plasma concentrations occurred in about 3 hours for both d - amphetamine and l - amphetamine .
The time to reach maximum plasma concentration ( Tmax ) for Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release is about 7 hours , which is about 4 hours longer compared to Dextroamphetamine sulfate , dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , amphetamine sulfate ( immediate - release ) .
This is consistent with the extended - release nature of the product .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] A single dose of Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , A single dose of Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release 20 mg capsules provided comparable plasma concentration profiles of both d - amphetamine and l - amphetamine to Dextroamphetamine sulfate , dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , amphetamine sulfate ( immediate - release ) 10 mg twice daily administered 4 hours apart .
The mean elimination half - life for d - amphetamine is 10 hours in adults ; 11 hours in adolescents aged 13 to 17 years and weighing less than or equal to 75 kg / 165 lbs ; and 9 hours in children aged 6 to 12 years .
For the l - amphetamine , the mean elimination half - life in adults is 13 hours ; 13 to 14 hours in adolescents ; and 11 hours in children aged 6 to 12 years .
On a mg / kg body weight basis , children have a higher clearance than adolescents or adults ( see Special Populations below ) .
Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release demonstrates linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 20 to 60 mg in adults and adolescents weighing greater than 75 kg / 165 lbs , over the dose range of 10 to 40 mg in adolescents weighing less than or equal to 75 kg / 165 lbs , and 5 to 30 mg in children aged 6 to 12 years .
There is no unexpected accumulation at steady state in children .
Food does not affect the extent of absorption of d - amphetamine and l - amphetamine , but prolongs Tmax by 2 . 5 hours ( from 5 . 2 hrs at fasted state to 7 . 7 hrs after a high - fat meal ) for d - amphetamine and 2 . 7 hours ( from 5 . 6 hrs at fasted state to 8 . 3 hrs after a high fat meal ) for l - amphetamine after administration of Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release 30 mg .
Opening the capsule and sprinkling the contents on applesauce results in comparable absorption to the intact capsule taken in the fasted state .
Equal doses of Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release strengths are bioequivalent .
Metabolism and Excretion Amphetamine is reported to be oxidized at the 4 position of the benzene ring to form 4 - hydroxyamphetamine , or on the side chain α or β carbons to form alpha - hydroxy - amphetamine or norephedrine , respectively .
Norephedrine and 4 - hydroxy - amphetamine are both active and each is subsequently oxidized to form 4 - hydroxy - norephedrine .
Alpha - hydroxy - amphetamine undergoes deamination to form phenylacetone , which ultimately forms benzoic acid and its glucuronide and the glycine conjugate hippuric acid .
Although the enzymes involved in amphetamine metabolism have not been clearly defined , CYP2D6 is known to be involved with formation of 4 - hydroxy - amphetamine .
Since CYP2D6 is genetically polymorphic , population variations in amphetamine metabolism are a possibility .
Amphetamine is known to inhibit monoamine oxidase , whereas the ability of amphetamine and its metabolites to inhibit various P450 isozymes and other enzymes has not been adequately elucidated .
In vitro experiments with human microsomes indicate minor inhibition of CYP2D6 by amphetamine and minor inhibition of CYP1A2 , 2D6 , and 3A4 by one or more metabolites .
However , due to the probability of auto - inhibition and the lack of information on the concentration of these metabolites relative to in vivo concentrations , no predications regarding the potential for amphetamine or its metabolites to inhibit the metabolism of other drugs by CYP isozymes in vivo can be made .
With normal urine pHs , approximately half of an administered dose of amphetamine is recoverable in urine as derivatives of alpha - hydroxy - amphetamine and approximately another 30 to 40 % of the dose is recoverable in urine as amphetamine itself .
Since amphetamine has a pKa of 9 . 9 , urinary recovery of amphetamine is highly dependent on pH and urine flow rates .
Alkaline urine pHs result in less ionization and reduced renal elimination , and acidic pHs and high flow rates result in increased renal elimination with clearances greater than glomerular filtration rates , indicating the involvement of active secretion .
Urinary recovery of amphetamine has been reported to range from 1 % to 75 % , depending on urinary pH , with the remaining fraction of the dose hepatically metabolized .
Consequently , both hepatic and renal dysfunction have the potential to inhibit the elimination of amphetamine and result in prolonged exposures .
In addition , drugs that effect urinary pH are known to alter the elimination of amphetamine , and any decrease in amphetamine ’ s metabolism that might occur due to drug interactions or genetic polymorphisms is more likely to be clinically significant when renal elimination is decreased [ see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7 ) ] .
Special Populations Comparison of the pharmacokinetics of d - and l - amphetamine after oral administration of Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release in children ( 6 to 12 years ) and adolescent ( 13 to 17 years ) ADHD patients and healthy adult volunteers indicates that body weight is the primary determinant of apparent differences in the pharmacokinetics of d - and l - amphetamine across the age range .
Systemic exposure measured by area under the curve to infinity ( AUC ∞ ) and maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) decreased with increases in body weight , while oral volume of distribution ( VZ / F ) , oral clearance ( CL / F ) , and elimination half - life ( t ½ ) increased with increases in body weight .
Pediatric Patients On a mg / kg weight basis , children eliminated amphetamine faster than adults .
The elimination half - life ( t ½ ) is approximately 1 hour shorter for d - amphetamine and 2 hours shorter for l - amphetamine in children than in adults .
However , children had higher systemic exposure to amphetamine ( Cmax and AUC ) than adults for a given dose of Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release , which was attributed to the higher dose administered to children on a mg / kg body weight basis compared to adults .
Upon dose normalization on a mg / kg basis , children showed 30 % less systemic exposure compared to adults .
Gender Systemic exposure to amphetamine was 20 to 30 % higher in women ( N = 20 ) than in men ( N = 20 ) due to the higher dose administered to women on a mg / kg body weight basis .
When the exposure parameters ( Cmax and AUC ) were normalized by dose ( mg / kg ) , these differences diminished .
Age and gender had no direct effect on the pharmacokinetics of d - and l - amphetamine .
Race Formal pharmacokinetic studies for race have not been conducted .
However , amphetamine pharmacokinetics appeared to be comparable among Caucasians ( N = 33 ) , Blacks ( N = 8 ) and Hispanics ( N = 10 ) Patients with Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on d - and l - amphetamine after administration of Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release has not been studied .
The impact of renal impairment on the disposition of amphetamine is expected to be similar between oral administration of lisdexamfetamine and Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release .
In a pharmacokinetic study of lisdexamfetamine in adult subjects with normal and impaired renal function , mean d - amphetamine clearance was reduced from 0 . 7 L / hr / kg in normal subjects to 0 . 4 L / hr / kg in subjects with severe renal impairment ( GFR 15 to < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) .
Dialysis did not significantly affect the clearance of d - amphetamine [ see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No evidence of carcinogenicity was found in studies in which d , l - amphetamine ( enantiomer ratio of 1 : 1 ) was administered to mice and rats in the diet for 2 years at doses of up to 30 mg / kg / day in male mice , 19 mg / kg / day in female mice , and 5 mg / kg / day in male and female rats .
These doses are approximately 2 . 4 , 1 . 5 , and 0 . 8 times , respectively , the maximum recommended human dose of 30 mg / da given to children , on a mg / m2 basis .
Mutagenesis Amphetamine , in the enantiomer ratio present in Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release ( d - to l - ratio of approximately of 3 : 1 ) , was not clastogenic in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test in vivo and was negative when tested in the E . coli component of the Ames test in vitro .
d , l - Amphetamine ( 1 : 1 enantiomer ratio ) has been reported to produce a positive response in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test , an equivocal response in the Ames test , and negative responses in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange and chromosomal aberration assays .
Impairment of Fertility Amphetamine , in the enantiomer ratio present in Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release ( d - to l - ratio of 3 : 1 ) , did not adversely affect fertility or early embryonic development in the rat at doses of up to 20 mg / kg / day ( approximately 8 times the maximum recommended human dose of 20 mg / day given to adolescents , on a mg / m2 basis ) .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Acute administration of high doses of amphetamine ( d - or d , l - ) has been shown to produce long - lasting neurotoxic effects , including irreversible nerve fiber damage , in rodents .
The significance of these findings to humans is unknown .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Pediatric Patients A double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled , parallel - group study was conducted in children aged 6 to 12 ( N = 584 ) who met DSM - IV ® criteria for ADHD ( either the combined type or the hyperactive - impulsive type ) .
Patients were randomized to fixed - dose treatment groups receiving final doses of 10 , 20 , or 30 mg of Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release or placebo once daily in the morning for three weeks .
Significant improvements in patient behavior , based upon teacher ratings of attention and hyperactivity , were observed for all Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release doses compared to patients who received placebo , for all three weeks , including the first week of treatment , when all Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release subjects were receiving a dose of 10 mg / day .
Patients who received Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release showed behavioral improvements in both morning and afternoon assessments compared to patients on placebo .
In a classroom analogue study , patients ( N = 51 ) receiving fixed doses of 10 mg , 20 mg or 30 mg Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release demonstrated statistically significant improvements in teacher - rated behavior and performance measures , compared to patients treated with placebo .
A double - blind , randomized , multi - center , parallel - group , placebo - controlled study was conducted in adolescents aged 13 to 17 ( N = 327 ) who met DSM - IV ® criteria for ADHD .
The primary cohort of patients ( n = 287 , weighing ≤ 75 kg / 165 lbs ) was randomized to fixed - dose treatment groups and received four weeks of treatment .
Patients were randomized to receive final doses of 10 mg , 20 mg , 30 mg , and 40 mg Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release or placebo once daily in the morning .
Patients randomized to doses greater than 10 mg were titrated to their final doses by 10 mg each week .
The secondary cohort consisted of 40 subjects weighing > 75 kg / 165 lbs who were randomized to fixed - dose treatment groups receiving final doses of 50 mg and 60 mg Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release or placebo once daily in the morning for 4 weeks .
The primary efficacy variable was the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder - Rating Scale IV ( ADHD - RS - IV ) total score for the primary cohort .
The ADHD - RS - IV is an 18 - item scale that measures the core symptoms of ADHD .
Improvements in the primary cohort were statistically significantly greater in all four primary cohort active treatment groups ( Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release 10 mg , 20 mg , 30 mg , and 40 mg ) compared with the placebo group .
There was not adequate evidence that doses greater than 20 mg / day conferred additional benefit .
Adult Patients A double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled , parallel - group study was conducted in adults ( N = 255 ) who met DSM - IV ® criteria for ADHD .
Patients were randomized to fixed - dose treatment groups receiving final doses of 20 , 40 , or 60 mg of Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release or placebo once daily in the morning for four weeks .
Significant improvements , measured with the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder - Rating Scale ( ADHD - RS ) , an 18 - item scale that measures the core symptoms of ADHD , were observed at endpoint for all Dextroamphetamine saccharate , amphetamine aspartate monohydrate , dextroamphetamine sulfate , amphetamine sulfate extended - release doses compared to patients who received placebo for all four weeks .
