( 5 . 8 , 8 . 1 ) 5 . 1 Allergic Reactions See boxed warning Grade 3 / 4 hypersensitivity , including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions , to Oxaliplatin Injection , USP has been observed in 2 to 3 % of colon cancer patients .
These allergic reactions which can be fatal , can occur within minutes of administration and at any cycle , and were similar in nature and severity to those reported with other platinum - containing compounds , such as rash , urticaria , erythema , pruritus , and , rarely , bronchospasm and hypotension .
The symptoms associated with hypersensitivity reactions reported in the previously untreated patients were urticaria , pruritus , flushing of the face , diarrhea associated with oxaliplatin infusion , shortness of breath , bronchospasm , diaphoresis , chest pains , hypotension , disorientation and syncope .
These reactions are usually managed with standard epinephrine , corticosteroid , antihistamine therapy , and require discontinuation of therapy .
Rechallenge is contraindicated in these patients [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Drug - related deaths associated withplatinum compounds from anaphylaxis have been reported .
5 . 2 Neurologic Toxicity Neuropathy Oxaliplatin Injection , USP is associated with two types of neuropathy : An acute , reversible , primarily peripheral , sensory neuropathy that is of early onset , occurring within hours or one to two days of dosing , that resolves within 14 days , and that frequently recurs with further dosing .
The symptoms may be precipitated or exacerbated by exposure to cold temperature or cold objects and they usually present as transient paresthesia , dysesthesia and hypoesthesia in the hands , feet , perioral area , or throat .
Jaw spasm , abnormal tongue sensation , dysarthria , eye pain , and a feeling of chest pressure have also been observed .
The acute , reversible pattern of sensory neuropathy was observed in about 56 % of study patients who received Oxaliplatin Injection , USP with 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin .
In any individual cycle acute neurotoxicity was observed in approximately 30 % of patients .
In adjuvant patients the median cycle of onset for grade 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy was 9 in the previously treated patients the median number of cycles administered on the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP with 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin combination arm was 6 .
An acute syndrome of pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia seen in 1 to 2 % ( grade 3 / 4 ) of patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer , and the previously treated patients , is characterized by subjective sensations of dysphagia or dyspnea , without any laryngospasm or bronchospasm ( no stridor or wheezing ) .
Ice ( mucositis prophylaxis ) should be avoided during the infusion of Oxaliplatin Injection , USP because cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms .
A persistent ( > 14 days ) , primarily peripheral , sensory neuropathy that is usually characterized by paresthesias , dysesthesias , hypoesthesias , but may also include deficits in proprioception that can interfere with daily activities ( e . g . , writing , buttoning , swallowing , and difficulty walking from impaired proprioception ) .
These forms of neuropathy occurred in 48 % of the study patients receiving Oxaliplatin Injection , USP with 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin .
Persistent neuropathy can occur without any prior acute neuropathy event .
The majority of the patients ( 80 % ) who developed grade 3 persistent neuropathy progressed from prior Grade 1 or 2 events .
These symptoms may improve in some patients upon discontinuation of Oxaliplatin Injection , USP .
In the adjuvant colon cancer trial , neuropathy was graded using a prelisted module derived from the Neuro - Sensory section of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria ( NCI CTC ) scale , Version 1 , as follows : Table 1 - NCI CTC Grading for Neuropathy in Adjuvant Patients Grade Definition Grade 0 No change or none Grade 1 Mild paresthesias , loss of deep tendon reflexes Grade 2 Mild or moderate objective sensory loss , moderate paresthesias Grade 3 Severe objective sensory loss or paresthesias that interfere with function Grade 4 Not applicable Peripheral sensory neuropathy was reported in adjuvant patients treated with the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP combination with a frequency of 92 % ( all grades ) and 13 % ( grade 3 ) .
At the 28 - day follow - up after the last treatment cycle , 60 % of all patients had any grade ( Grade 1 = 40 % , Grade 2 = 16 % , Grade 3 = 5 % ) peripheral sensory neuropathy decreasing to 39 % at 6 months follow - up ( Grade 1 = 31 % , Grade 2 = 7 % , Grade 3 = 1 % ) and 21 % at 18 months of follow - up ( Grade 1 = 17 % , Grade 2 = 3 % , Grade 3 = 1 % ) .
In the advanced colorectal cancer studies , neuropathy was graded using a study - specific neurotoxicity scale , which was different from the NCI CTC scale , Version 2 . 0 ( see below ) .
Table 2 - Grading Scale for Paresthesias / Dysesthesias in Advanced Colorectal Cancer Patients Grade Definition Grade 1 Resolved and did not interfere with functioning Grade 2 Interfered with function but not daily activities Grade 3 Pain or functional impairment that interfered with daily activities Grade 4 Persistent impairment that is disabling or life - threatening Overall , neuropathy was reported in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer in 82 % ( all grades ) and 19 % ( grade 3 / 4 ) , and in the previously treated patients in 74 % ( all grades ) and 7 % ( grade 3 / 4 ) events .
Information regarding reversibility of neuropathy was not available from the trial for patients who had not been previously treated for colorectal cancer .
Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome ( RPLS , also known as PRES , Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome ) has been observed in clinical trials ( < 0 . 1 % ) and postmarketing experience .
Signs and symptoms of RPLS could be headache , altered mental functioning , seizures , abnormal vision from blurriness to blindness , associated or not with hypertension [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Diagnosis of RPLS is based upon confirmation by brain imaging .
5 . 3 Severe Neutropenia 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 41 to 44 % of patients with colorectal cancer treated with Oxaliplatin Injection , USP in combination with 5 - flurouracil ( 5 - FU ) and leucovorin compared to 5 % with 5 - FU plus leucovorin alone .

However , the following grade 3 / 4 events were more common in females : diarrhea , fatigue , granulocytopenia , nausea and vomiting .
In patients ≥ 65 years old , the incidence of grade 3 / 4 diarrhea and granulocytopenia was higher than in younger patients .
Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis of safety by race .
The following additional adverse reactions , were reported in ≥ 2 % and < 5 % of the patients in the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and infusional 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin combination arm ( listed in decreasing order of frequency ) : pain , leukopenia , weight decrease , coughing .
The number of patients who developed secondary malignancies was similar ; 62 in the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP combination arm and 68 in the infusional 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin arm .
An exploratory analysis showed that the number of deaths due to secondary malignancies was 1 . 96 % in the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP combination arm and 0 . 98 % in infusional 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin arm .
In addition , the number of cardiovascular deaths was 1 . 4 % in the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP combination arm as compared to 0 . 7 % in the infusional 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin arm .
Clinical significance of these findings is unknown .
Patients Previously Untreated for Advanced Colorectal Cancer Two hundred and fifty - nine patients were treated in the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin combination arm of the randomized trial in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer [ s ee C li n i c al S t ud i es ( 14 ) ] .
The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below .
Both 5 - fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin Injection , USP are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions .
When Oxaliplatin Injection , USP is administered in combination with 5 - fluorouracil , the incidence of these events is increased .
The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer study , regardless of causality , was 3 % with the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 fluorouracil / leucovorin combination , 5 % with irinotecan plus 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin , and 3 % with Oxaliplatin Injection , USP plus irinotecan .
Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 2 . 3 % with the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin combination , 5 . 1 % with irinotecan plus 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin , and 3 . 1 % with Oxaliplatin Injection , USP plus irinotecan .

The following additional adverse reactions , at least possibly related to treatment and potentially important , were reported in ≥ 2 % and < 5 % of the patients in the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin combination arm ( listed in decreasing order of frequency ) : metabolic , pneumonitis , catheter infection , vertigo , prothrombin time , pulmonary , rectal bleeding , dysuria , nail changes , chest pain , rectal pain , syncope , hypertension , hypoxia , unknown infection , bone pain , pigmentation changes , and urticaria .
Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer Four hundred and fifty patients ( about 150 receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin ) were studied in a randomized trial in patients with refractory and relapsed colorectal cancer [ s ee C li n i c al S t ud i es ( 14 ) ] .
The adverse reaction profile in this study was similar to that seen in other studies and the adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below .
Thirteen percent of patients in the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin combination arm and 18 % in the 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin arm of the previously treated study had to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects related to gastrointestinal , or hematologic adverse reactions , or neuropathies .
Both 5 - fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin Injection , USP are associated with gastrointestinal and hematologic adverse reactions .
When Oxaliplatin Injection , USP is administered in combination with 5 - fluorouracil , the incidence of these events is increased .
The incidence of death within 30 days of treatment in the previously treated study , regardless of causality , was 5 % with the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin combination , 8 % with Oxaliplatin Injection , USP alone , and 7 % with 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin .
Of the 7 deaths that occurred on the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin combination arm within 30 days of stopping treatment , 3 may have been treatment related , associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or dehydration .
The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the previously treated study [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] by body system and in decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin combination arm for events with overall incidences ≥ 5 % and for grade 3 / 4 events with incidences ≥ 1 % .

The incidence of all hemorrhagic events in the adjuvant and previously treated patients was higher on the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP combination arm compared to the infusional 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin arm .
These events included gastrointestinal bleeding , hematuria , and epistaxis .
In the adjuvant trial , two patients died from intracerebral hemorrhages .
The incidence of Grade 3 / 4 thrombocytopenia was 2 % in adjuvant patients with colon cancer .
In patients treated for advanced colorectal cancer the incidence of Grade 3 / 4 thrombocytopenia was 3 to 5 % , and the incidence of these events was greater for the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin over the irinotecan plus 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin or 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin control groups .
Grade 3 / 4 gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in 0 . 2 % of adjuvant patients receiving Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin .
In the previously untreated patients , the incidence of epistaxis was 10 % in the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin arm , and 2 % and 1 % , respectively , in the irinotecan plus 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin or irinotecan plus Oxaliplatin Injection , USP arms .
Neutropenia Neutropenia was frequently observed with the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin , with Grade 3 and 4 events reported in 29 % and 12 % of adjuvant patients with colon cancer , respectively .
In the adjuvant trial , 3 patients died from sepsis / neutropenic sepsis .
Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 35 % and 18 % of the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer , respectively .
Grade 3 and 4 events were reported in 27 % and 17 % of previously treated patients , respectively .
In adjuvant patients the incidence of either febrile neutropenia ( 0 . 7 % ) or documented infection with concomitant grade 3 / 4 neutropenia ( 1 . 1 % ) was 1 . 8 % in the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin arm .
The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer was 15 % ( 3 % of cycles ) in the irinotecan plus 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin arm and 4 % ( less than 1 % of cycles ) in the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin combination arm .
Additionally , in this same population , infection with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was 12 % in the irinotecan plus 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin , and 8 % in the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin combination .
The incidence of febrile neutropenia in the previously treated patients was 1 % in the 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin arm and 6 % ( less than 1 % of cycles ) in the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin combination arm .
Gastrointestinal In patients receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection , USP plus infusional 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin for adjuvant treatment for colon cancer the incidence of Grade 3 / 4 nausea and vomiting was greater than those receiving infusional 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin alone ( see table ) .
In patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer receiving the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin , the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 vomiting and diarrhea was less compared to irinotecan plus 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin controls ( see table ) .

Pregnant rats were administered oxaliplatin at less than one - tenth the recommended human dose based on body surface area during gestation days 1 to 5 ( pre - implantation ) , 6 to 10 , or 11 to 16 ( during organogenesis ) .
Oxaliplatin caused developmental mortality ( increased early resorptions ) when administered on days 6 to 10 and 11 to 16 and adversely affected fetal growth ( decreased fetal weight , delayed ossification ) when administered on days 6 to 10 .
Administration of oxaliplatin to male and female rats prior to mating resulted in 97 % post - implantation loss in animals that received approximately one - seventh the recommended human dose based on the body surface area .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Oxaliplatin Injection , USP or its derivatives are excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Oxaliplatin Injection , USP a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The effectiveness of oxaliplatin in children has not been established .
Oxaliplatin has been tested in 2 Phase 1 and 2 Phase 2 trials in 235 patients ages 7 months to 22 years with solid tumors ( see below ) and no significant activity observed .
In a Phase 1 / 2 study , oxaliplatin was administered as a 2 - hour intravenous infusion on Days 1 , 8 and 15 every 4 weeks ( 1 cycle ) , for a maximum of 6 cycles , to 43 patients with refractory or relapsed malignant solid tumors , mainly neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma .
Twenty eight pediatric patients in the Phase 1 study received oxaliplatin at 6 dose levels starting at 40 mg / m 2 with escalation to 110 mg / m 2 .
The dose limiting toxicity ( DLT ) was sensory neuropathy at the 110 mg / m 2 dose .
Fifteen patients received oxaliplatin at a dose of 90 mg / m 2 intravenous in the Phase 2 portion of the study .
At this dose , paresthesia ( 60 % , G3 / 4 : 7 % ) , fever ( 40 % , G3 / 4 : 7 % ) and thrombocytopenia ( 40 % , G3 / 4 : 27 % ) were the main adverse reactions .
No responses were observed .
In a second Phase 1 study , oxaliplatin was administered to 26 pediatric patients as a 2 - hour intravenous infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks ( 1 cycle ) at 5 dose levels starting at 100 mg / m 2 with escalation to 160 mg / m 2 , for a maximum of 6 cycles .
In a separate cohort , oxaliplatin 85 mg / m 2 was administered on day 1 every 2 weeks , for a maximum of 9 doses .
Patients had metastatic or unresectable solid tumors mainly neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroblastoma .
No responses were observed .
The DLT was sensory neuropathy at the 160 mg / m 2 dose .
Based on these studies , oxaliplatin 130 mg / m 2 as a 2 - hour intravenous infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks ( 1 cycle ) was used in subsequent Phase II studies .
A dose of 85 mg / m 2 on day 1 every 2 weeks was also found to be tolerable .
In one Phase 2 study , 43 pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory embryonal CNS tumors received oxaliplatin 130 mg / m 2 every 3 weeks for a maximum of 12 months in absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity .
In patients < 10 kg the oxaliplatin dose used was 4 . 3 mg / kg .
The most common adverse reactions reported were leukopenia ( 67 % , G3 / 4 : 12 % ) , anemia ( 65 % , G3 / 4 : 5 % ) , thrombocytopenia ( 65 % , G3 / 4 : 26 % ) , vomiting ( 65 % , G3 / 4 : 7 % ) , neutropenia ( 58 % , G3 / 4 : 16 % ) and sensory neuropathy ( 40 % , G3 / 4 : 5 % ) .
One partial response was observed .
In a second Phase 2 study , 123 pediatric patients with recurrent solid tumors , including neuroblastoma , osteosarcoma , Ewing sarcoma or peripheral PNET , ependymoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , hepatoblastoma , high grade astrocytoma , Brain stem glioma , low grade astrocytoma , malignant germ cell tumor and other tumors of interest received oxaliplatin 130 mg / m every 3 weeks for a maximum of 12 months or 17 cycles .
In patients ≤ 12 months old the oxaliplatin dose used was 4 . 3 mg / kg .
The most common adverse reactions reported were sensory neuropathy ( 52 % , G3 / 4 : 12 % ) , thrombocytopenia ( 37 % , G3 / 4 : 17 % ) , anemia ( 37 % , G3 / 4 : 9 % ) , vomiting ( 26 % , G3 / 4 : 4 % ) , ALT increased ( 24 % , G3 / 4 : 6 % ) , AST increased ( 24 % , G3 / 4 : 2 % ) , and nausea ( 23 % , G3 / : 4 3 % ) .
Two partial responses were observed .
The pharmacokinetic parameters of ultrafiltrable platinum have been evaluated in 105 pediatric patients during the first cycle .
The mean clearance in pediatric patients estimated by the population pharmacokinetic analysis was 4 . 7 L / h .
The inter - patient variability of platinum clearance in pediatric cancer patients was 41 % .
Mean platinum pharmacokinetic parameters in ultrafiltrate were C max of 0 . 75 ± 0 . 24 mcg / mL , AUC 0 - 48 of 7 . 52 ± 5 . 07 mcg · h / mL and AUC inf of 8 . 83 ± 1 . 57 mcg · h / mL at 85 mg / m 2 of oxaliplatin and C max of 1 . 10 ± 0 . 43 mcg / mL , AUC 0 - 48 of 9 . 74 ± 2 . 52 mcg · h / mL and AUC inf of 17 . 3 ± 5 . 34 mcg · h / mL at 130 mg / m 2 of oxaliplatin .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No significant effect of age on the clearance of ultrafilterable platinum has been observed .
In the adjuvant therapy colon cancer randomized clinical trial , [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] 723 patients treated with Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and infusional 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin were < 65 years and 400 patients were ≥ 65 years .
A descriptive subgroup analysis demonstrated that the improvement in DFS for the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP combination arm compared to the infusional 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin alone arm appeared to be maintained across genders .
The effect of Oxaliplatin Injection , USP in patients ≥ 65 years of age was not conclusive .
Insufficient subgroup sizes prevented analysis by race .
Patients ≥ 65 years of age receiving the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP combination therapy experienced more grade 3 to 4 granulocytopenia than patients < 65 years of age ( 45 % versus 39 % ) .
In the previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer randomized clinical trial [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] of Oxaliplatin Injection USP , 160 patients treated with Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin were < 65 years and 99 patients were ≥ 65 years .
The same efficacy improvements in response rate , time to tumor progression , and overall survival were observed in the ≥ 65 year old patients as in the overall study population .
In the previously treated for advanced colorectal cancer randomized clinical trial [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] of Oxaliplatin Injection USP , 95 patients treated with Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin were < 65 years and 55 patients were ≥ 65 years .
The rates of overall adverse reactions , including grade 3 and 4 events , were similar across and within arms in the different age groups in all studies .
The incidence of diarrhea , dehydration , hypokalemia , leukopenia , fatigue and syncope were higher in patients ≥ 65 years old .
No adjustment to starting dose was required in patients ≥ 65 years old .
8 . 6 Patients with Renal Impairment The exposure ( AUC ) of unbound platinum in plasma ultrafiltrate tends to increase in renally impaired patients [ see Pharmacokinetics ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Caution and close monitoring should be exercised when Oxaliplatin Injection , USP is administered to patients with renal impairment .
The starting Oxaliplatin Injection , USP dose does not need to be reduced in patients with mild ( creatinine clearance = 50 to 80 mL / min ) or moderate ( creatinine clearance = 30 to 49 mL / min ) renal impairment .
However , the starting dose of Oxaliplatin Injection , USP should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known antidote for Oxaliplatin Injection , USP overdose .
In addition to thrombocytopenia , the anticipated complications of an Oxaliplatin Injection , USP overdose include hypersensitivity reaction , myelosuppression , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and neurotoxicity .
Several cases of overdoses have been reported with Oxaliplatin Injection , USP .
Adverse reactions observed were Grade 4 thrombocytopenia ( < 25 , 000 / mm 3 ) without any bleeding , anemia , sensory neuropathy such as paresthesia , dysesthesia , laryngospasm and facial muscle spasms , gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea , vomiting , stomatitis , flatulence , abdomen enlarged and Grade 4 intestinal obstruction , Grade 4 dehydration , dyspnea , wheezing , chest pain , respiratory failure , severe bradycardia and death .
Patients suspected of receiving an overdose should be monitored , and supportive treatment should be administered .
The maximum dose of oxaliplatin that has been administered in a single infusion is 825 mg .
11 DESCRIPTION Oxaliplatin Injection is an antineoplastic agent with the molecular formula C 8 H 14 N 2 O 4 Pt and the chemical name of cis - [ ( 1 R , 2 R ) - 1 , 2 - cyclohexanediamine - N , N ' ] oxalato ( 2 - ) - O , O ' ] platinum .
Oxaliplatin is an organoplatinum complex in which the platinum atom is complexed with 1 , 2 - diaminocyclohexane ( DACH ) and with an oxalate ligand as a leaving group .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] The molecular weight is 397 . 3 .
Oxaliplatin is slightly soluble in water at 6 mg / mL , very slightly soluble in methanol , and practically insoluble in ethanol and acetone .
Oxaliplatin Injection is supplied in vials containing 50 mg or 100 mg of oxaliplatin as a sterile , preservative - free , aqueous solution at a concentration of 5 mg / mL .
Water for Injection , USP is present as an inactive ingredient .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Oxaliplatin undergoes nonenzymatic conversion in physiologic solutions to active derivatives via displacement of the labile oxalate ligand .
Several transient reactive species are formed , including monoaquo and diaquo DACH platinum , which covalently bind with macromolecules .
Both inter - and intrastrand Pt - DNA crosslinks are formed .
Crosslinks are formed between the N7 positions of two adjacent guanines ( GG ) , adjacent adenine - g uanines ( AG ) , and guanines separated by an intervening nucleotide ( GNG ) .
These crosslinks inhibit DNA replication and transcription .
Cytotoxicity is cell - cycle nonspecific .
In vivo studies have shown antitumor activity of oxaliplatin against colon carcinoma .
In combination with 5 - fluorouracil , oxaliplatin exhibits in vitro and in vivo antiproliferative activity greater than either compound alone in several tumor models [ HT29 ( colon ) , GR ( mammary ) , and L1210 ( leukemia ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The reactive oxaliplatin derivatives are present as a fraction of the unbound platinum in plasma ultrafiltrate .
The decline of ultrafilterable platinum levels following oxaliplatin administration is triphasic , characterized by two relatively short distribution phases ( t 1 / 2α ; 0 . 43 hours and t 1 / 2β ; 16 . 8 hours ) and a long terminal elimination phase ( t 1 / 2γ ; 391 hours ) .
Pharmacokinetic parameters obtained after a single 2 - hour intravenous infusion of Oxaliplatin Injection , USP at a dose of 85 mg / m 2 expressed as ultrafilterable platinum were C max of 0 . 814 mcg / mL and volume of distribution of 440 L . Interpatient and intrapatient variability in ultrafilterable platinum exposure ( AUC 0 – 48 hr ) assessed over 3 cycles was moderate to low ( 23 % and 6 % , respectively ) .
A pharmacodynamic relationship between platinum ultrafiltrate levels and clinical safety and effectiveness has not been established .
Distribution At the end of a 2 - hour infusion of Oxaliplatin Injection , USP , approximately 15 % of the administered platinum is present in the systemic circulation .
The remaining 85 % is rapidly distributed into tissues or eliminated in the urine .
In patients , plasma protein binding of platinum is irreversible and is greater than 90 % .
The main binding proteins are albumin and gamma - globulins .
Platinum also binds irreversibly and accumulates ( approximately 2 - fold ) in erythrocytes , where it appears to have no relevant activity .
No platinum accumulation was observed in plasma ultrafiltrate following 85 mg / m 2 every two weeks .
Metabolism Oxaliplatin undergoes rapid and extensive nonenzymatic biotransformation .
There is no evidence of cytochrome P450 - mediated metabolism in vitro .
Up to 17 platinum - containing derivatives have been observed in plasma ultrafiltrate samples from patients , including several cytotoxic species ( monochloro DACH platinum , dichloro DACH platinum , and monoaquo and diaquo DACH platinum ) and a number of noncytotoxic , conjugated species .
Elimination The major route of platinum elimination is renal excretion .
At five days after a single 2 - hour infusion of Oxaliplatin Injection , USP , urinary elimination accounted for about 54 % of the platinum eliminated , with fecal excretion accounting for only about 2 % .
Platinum was cleared from plasma at a rate ( 10 to 17 L / h ) that was similar to or exceeded the average human glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ; 7 . 5 L / h ) .
T here was no significant effect of gender on the clearance of ultrafilterable platinum .
The renal clearance of ultrafilterable platinum is significantly correlated with GFR .
Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Pediatric [ See Use In Specific Patient Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Renal Impairment A study was conducted in 38 patients with advanced GI cancer and varying degrees of renal impairment .
Patients in the normal ( creatinine clearance ( CrCL ) > 80 mL / min , N = 11 ) , mild ( CrCL = 50 to 80 mL / min , N = 13 ) , and moderate ( CrCL = 30 to 49 mL / min , N = 10 ) groups were treated with 85 mg / m 2 Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and those in the severe ( CrCL < 30 mL / min , N = 4 ) group were treated with 65 mg / m 2 Oxaliplatin Injection , USP .
The mean AUC of unbound platinum was 40 % , 95 % , and 342 % higher in the mild , moderate , and severe groups , respectively , than in the normal group .
Mean C max of unbound platinum appeared to be similar among the normal , mild and moderate renal function groups , but was 38 % higher in the severe group than in the normal group .
Caution should be exercised in renally impaired patients [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
The starting dose of Oxaliplatin Injection , USP should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
The starting dose of Oxaliplatin Injection , USP should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Drug - Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic interaction between 85 mg / m 2 of Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and infusional 5 - fluorouracil has been observed in patients treated every 2 weeks , but increases of 5 - fluorouracil plasma concentrations by approximately 20 % have been observed with doses of 130 mg / m 2 of Oxaliplatin Injection , USP administered every 3 weeks .
In vitro , platinum was not displaced from plasma proteins by the following medications : erythromycin , salicylate , sodium valproate , granisetron , and paclitaxel .
In vitro , oxaliplatin is not metabolized by , nor does it inhibit , human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes .
No P450 - mediated drug - drug interactions are therefo re anticipated in patients .
Since platinum - containing species are eliminated primarily through the kidney , clearance of these products may be decreased by co - administration of potentially nephrotoxic compounds , although this has not been specifically studied .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of oxaliplatin .
Oxaliplatin was not mutagenic to bacteria ( Ames test ) but was mutagenic to mammalian cells in vitro ( L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay ) .
Oxaliplatin was clastogenic both in vitro ( chromosome aberration in human lymphocytes ) and in vivo ( mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay ) .
In a fertility study , male rats were given oxaliplatin at 0 , 0 . 5 , 1 , or 2 mg / kg / day for five days every 21 days for a total of three cycles prior to mating with females that received two cycles of oxaliplatin on the same schedule .
A dose of 2 mg / kg / day ( less than one - seventh the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis ) did not affect pregnancy rate , but caused developmental mortality ( increased early resorptions , decreased live fetuses , decreased live births ) and delayed growth ( decreased fetal weight ) .
Testicular damage , characterized by degeneration , hypoplasia , and atrophy , was observed in dogs administered oxaliplatin at 0 . 75 mg / kg / day × 5 days every 28 days for three cycles .
A no effect level was not identified .
This daily dose is approximately one - sixth of the recommended human dose on a body surface area basis .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Combination Adjuvant Therapy with Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and Infusional 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer An international , multicenter , randomized study compared the efficacy and evaluated the safety of Oxaliplatin Injection , USP in combination with an infusional schedule of 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin to infusional 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin alone , in patients with stage II ( Dukes ' B2 ) or III ( Dukes ' C ) colon cancer who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor .
The primary objective of the study was to compare the 3 - year disease - free survival ( DFS ) in patients receiving Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and infusional 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin to those receiving 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin alone .
Patients were to be treated for a total of 6 months ( i . e . , 12 cycles ) .
A total of 2246 patients were randomized ; 1123 patients per study arm .
Patients in the study had to be between 18 and 75 years of age , have histologically proven stage II ( T 3 to T 4 N0 M0 ; Dukes ' B2 ) or III ( any T N 1 – 2 M0 ; Dukes ' C ) colon carcinoma ( with the inferior pole of the tumor above the peritoneal reflection , i . e . , ≥ 15 cm from the anal margin ) and undergone ( within 7 weeks prior to randomization ) complete resection of the primary tumor without gross or microscopic evidence of residual disease .
Patients had to have had no prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy or radiotherapy , and have an ECOG performance status of 0 , 1 , or 2 ( KPS ≥ 60 % ) , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) > 1 . 5x10 9 / L , platelets ≥ 100 × 10 9 / L , serum creatinine ≤ 1 . 25 × ULN total bilirubin < 2 × ULN , AST / ALT < 2 × ULN and carcino - embyrogenic antigen ( CEA ) < 10 ng / mL .
Patients with preexisting peripheral neuropathy ( NCI grade ≥ 1 ) were ineligible for this trial .

The study had 7 arms at different times during its conduct , four of which were closed due to either changes in the standard of care , toxicity , or simplification .
During the study , the control arm was changed to irinotecan plus 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin .
The results reported below compared the efficacy and safety of two experimental regimens , Oxaliplatin Injection , USP in combination with infusional 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin and a combination of Oxaliplatin Injection , USP plus irinotecan , to an approved control regimen of irinotecan plus 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin in 795 concurrently randomized patients previously untreated for locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer .
After completion of enrollment , the dose of irinotecan plus 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin was decreased due to toxicity .
Patients had to be at least 18 years of age , have known locally advanced , locally recurrent , or metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma not curable by surgery or amenable to radiation therapy with curative intent , histologically proven colorectal adenocarcinoma , measurable or evaluable disease , with an ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , or 2 .
Patients had to have granulocyte count ≥ 1 . 5 × 10 9 / L , platelets ≥ 100 × 10 9 / L , hemoglobin ≥ 9 . 0 gm / dL , creatinine ≤ 1 . 5 × ULN , total bilirubin ≤ 1 . 5 mg / dL , AST ≤ 5 × ULN , and alkaline phosphatase ≤ 5 × ULN .
Patients may have received adjuvant therapy for resected Stage II or III disease without recurrence within 12 months .
The patients were stratified for ECOG performance status ( 0 , 1 vs . 2 ) , prior adjuvant chemotherapy ( yes vs . no ) , prior immunotherapy ( yes vs . no ) , and age ( < 65 vs . ≥ 65 years ) .
Although no post study treatment was specified in the protocol , 65 to 72 % of patients received additional post study chemotherapy after study treatment discontinuation on all arms .
Fifty - eight percent of patients on the Oxaliplatin Injection , USP plus 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin arm received an irinotecan - containing regimen and 23 % of patients on the irinotecan plus 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin arm received oxaliplatin - containing regimens .

Events were limited to radiographic disease progression documented by independent review of radiographs .
Clinical progression was notincluded in this analysis , and 18 % of patients were excluded from the analysis based on unavailability of the radiographs for independent review .
At the time of the interim analysis 49 % of the radiographic progression events had occurred .
In this interim analysis an estimated 2 - month increase in median time to radiographic progression was observed compared to 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin alone .
Of the 13 patients who had tumor response to the combination of Oxaliplatin Injection , USP and 5 - fluorouracil / leucovorin , 5 were female and 8 were male , and responders included patients < 65 years old and ≥ 65 years old .
The small number of non - Caucasian participants made efficacy analyses in these populations uninterpretable .
