Avoid use in premature neonates and low - birth weight infants .
( 5 . 3 ) • • Laboratory test alterations : False positive tests for urinary ketones and interference with enzymatic CPK activity tests have been seen .
( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions MESNEX may cause systemic hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis .
These reactions may include fever , cardiovascular symptoms ( hypotension , tachycardia ) , acute renal impairment , hypoxia , respiratory distress , urticaria , angioedema , laboratory signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation , hematological abnormalities , increased liver enzymes , nausea , vomiting , arthralgia , and myalgia .
These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure .
Monitor for signs or symptoms .
Discontinue MESNEX and provide supportive care .
5 . 2 Dermatologic Toxicity Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and bullous and ulcerative skin and mucosal reactions , consistent with Stevens - Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred .
MESNEX may cause skin and mucosal reactions characterized by urticaria , rash , erythema , pruritus , burning sensation , angioedema , periorbital edema , flushing and stomatitis .
These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure .
Discontinue MESNEX and provide supportive care .
5 . 3 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the “ gasping syndrome ” occurred in premature neonates and low - birth weight infants who received benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg / kg / day ( blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0 . 61 to 1 . 378 mmol / L ) .
Symptoms associated with “ gasping syndrome ” and other potential adverse reactions include gradual neurological deterioration , seizures , intracranial hemorrhage , hematological abnormalities , skin breakdown , hepatic and renal failure , hypotension , bradycardia , and cardiovascular collapse .
Premature neonates and low - birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol .
The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known .
MESNEX injection contains 10 . 4 mg / mL of the preservative benzyl alcohol .
Avoid use of MESNEX injection in premature neonates and low - birth weight infants .
MESNEX tablets do not contain benzyl alcohol [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 4 Laboratory Test Interferences False - Positive Urine Tests for Ketone Bodies A false positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with MESNEX when using nitroprusside sodium - based urine tests ( including dipstick tests ) .
The addition of glacial acetic acid can be used to differentiate between a false positive result ( cherry - red color that fades ) and a true positive result ( red - violet color that intensifies ) .
False - Negative Tests for Enzymatic CPK Activity MESNEX may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase ( CPK ) activity tests that use a thiol compound ( e . g . , N - acetylcysteine ) for CPK reactiviation .
This may result in a falsely low CPK level .
False - Positive Tests for Ascorbic Acid MESNEX may cause false - positive reactions in Tillman ’ s reagent - based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid .
5 . 5 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds MESNEX is a thiol compound , i . e . , a sulfhydryl ( SH ) group - containing organic compound .
Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and to amifostine , another thiol compound , have been reported .
It is not clear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to a thiol compound are at increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to MESNEX .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling .
• • Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Dermatological Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • • Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • • Laboratory Test Interferences [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • • Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] The most common adverse reactions ( > 10 % ) when MESNEX is given with ifosfamide are nausea , vomiting , constipation , leukopenia , fatigue , fever , anorexia , thrombocytopenia , anemia , granulocytopenia , diarrhea , asthenia , abdominal pain , headache , alopecia , and somnolence .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Baxter Healthcare at 1 - 866 - 888 - 2472 , or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch 6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
MESNEX adverse reaction data are available from four Phase 1 studies in which single intravenous doses of 600 - 1200 mg MESNEX injection without concurrent chemotherapy were administered to a total of 53 healthy volunteers and single oral doses of 600 - 2400 mg of MESNEX tablets were administered to a total of 82 healthy volunteers .
The most frequently reported side effects ( observed in two or more healthy volunteers ) for healthy volunteers receiving single doses of MESNEX injection alone were headache , injection site reactions , flushing , dizziness , nausea , vomiting , somnolence , diarrhea , anorexia , fever , pharyngitis , hyperesthesia , influenza - like symptoms , and coughing .
In two Phase 1 multiple - dose studies where healthy volunteers received MESNEX tablets alone or intravenous MESNEX followed by repeated doses of MESNEX tablets , flatulence and rhinitis were reported .
In addition , constipation was reported by healthy volunteers who had received repeated doses of intravenous MESNEX .
Additional adverse reactions in healthy volunteers receiving MESNEX alone included injection site reactions , abdominal pain / colic , epigastric pain / burning , mucosal irritation , lightheadedness , back pain , arthralgia , myalgia , conjunctivitis , nasal congestion , rigors , paresthesia , photophobia , fatigue , lymphadenopathy , extremity pain , malaise , chest pain , dysuria , pleuritic pain , dry mouth , dyspnea , and hyperhidrosis .
In healthy volunteers , MESNEX was commonly associated with a rapid ( within 24 hours ) decrease in lymphocyte count , which was generally reversible within one week of administration .
Because MESNEX is used in combination with ifosfamide or ifosfamide - containing chemotherapy regimens , it is difficult to distinguish the adverse reactions which may be due to MESNEX from those caused by the concomitantly administered cytotoxic agents .
Adverse reactions reasonably associated with MESNEX administered intravenously and orally in four controlled studies in which patients received ifosfamide or ifosfamide - containing regimens are presented in Table 3 .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported in the postmarketing experience of patients receiving MESNEX in combination with ifosfamide or similar drugs , making it difficult to distinguish the adverse reactions which may be due to MESNEX from those caused by the concomitantly administered cytotoxic agents .
Because these reactions are reported from a population of unknown size , precise estimates of frequency cannot be made .
Cardiovascular : Hypertension Gastrointestinal : Dysgeusia Hepatobiliary : Hepatitis Nervous System : Convulsion Respiratory : Hemoptysis 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No clinical drug interaction studies have been conducted with MESNEX .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Pregnancy : MESNEX in combination with ifosfamide can cause fetal harm .
Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus .
( 8 . 1 ) • • Lactation : Do not breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) • • Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : Advise patients to use effective contraception .
Verify pregnancy status prior to initiation of MESNEX in combination with ifosfamide .
( 8 . 3 ) • • Pediatric use : In premature neonates and low - birth weight infants , avoid use of benzyl alcohol – containing solutions .
( 8 . 4 ) • • Geriatric use : Dose selection should be cautious .
( 8 . 5 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary MESNEX is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents .
Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy .
MESNEX injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol .
Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a pregnant woman , benzyl alcohol exposure in the fetus is unlikely [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data MESNEX is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents .
Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm including embryo - fetal lethality .
Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during pregnancy .
In embryo - fetal development studies , oral administration of mesna to pregnant rats ( 500 , 1000 , 1500 , and 2000 mg / kg ) and rabbits ( 500 and 1000 mg / kg ) during the period of organogenesis revealed no adverse developmental outcomes at doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended total daily human equivalent dose based on body surface area .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary MESNEX is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents .
Ifosfamide is excreted in breast milk .
Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on use during lactation .
There are no data on the presence of mesna in human or animal milk , the effect on the breastfed child , or the effect on milk production .
MESNEX injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol .
Because benzyl alcohol is rapidly metabolized by a lactating woman , benzyl alcohol exposure in the breastfed infant is unlikely .
However , adverse reactions have occurred in premature neonates and low birth weight infants who received intravenously administered benzyl alcohol - containing drugs [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child , advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose of MESNEX or ifosfamide .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential MESNEX is used in combination with ifosfamide or other cytotoxic agents .
Ifosfamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Refer to the ifosfamide prescribing information for more information on contraception and effects on fertility .
Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of MESNEX in combination with ifosfamide .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with MESNEX in combination with ifosfamide and for 6 months after the last dose .
Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with MESNEX in combination with ifosfamide and for 3 months after the last dose .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use MESNEX injection contains the preservative benzyl alcohol which has been associated with serious adverse reactions and death when administered intravenously to premature neonates and low birth weight infants .
Avoid use of MESNEX injection in premature neonates and low - birth weight infants [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of MESNEX did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
The ratio of ifosfamide to MESNEX should remain unchanged .
8 . 6 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of MESNEX .
8 . 7 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of MESNEX .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known antidote for MESNEX .
In a clinical trial , 11 patients received intravenous MESNEX 10 mg / kg to 66 mg / kg per day for 3 to 5 days .
Patients also received ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide .
Adverse reactions included nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and fever .
An increased rate of these adverse reactions has also been found in oxazaphosphorine - treated patients receiving ≥ 80 mg MESNEX per kg per day intravenously compared with patients receiving lower doses or hydration treatment only .
Postmarketing , administration of 4 . 5 g to 6 . 9 g of MESNEX resulted in hypersensitivity reactions including mild hypotension , shortness of breath , asthma exacerbation , rash , and flushing .
11 DESCRIPTION MESNEX ( mesna ) is a detoxifying agent to inhibit the hemorrhagic cystitis induced by ifosfamide .
The active ingredient , mesna , is a synthetic sulfhydryl compound designated as sodium - 2 - mercaptoethane sulfonate with a molecular formula of C2H5NaO3S2 and a molecular weight of 164 . 18 .
Its structural formula is as follows : HS – CH2 – CH2SO3 – Na + MESNEX injection is a sterile , nonpyrogenic , aqueous solution of clear and colorless appearance in clear glass multidose vials for intravenous administration .
MESNEX injection contains 100 mg / mL mesna , 0 . 25 mg / mL edetate disodium and sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment .
MESNEX injection multidose vials also contain 10 . 4 mg / mL of benzyl alcohol as a preservative .
The solution has a pH range of 7 . 5 - 8 . 5 .
MESNEX tablets are white , oblong , scored biconvex film - coated tablets with the imprint M4 .
They contain 400 mg mesna .
The excipients are calcium phosphate , cornstarch , hydroxypropylmethylcellulose , lactose , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose , polyethylene glycol , povidone , simethicone , and titanium dioxide .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Mesna reacts chemically with the urotoxic ifosfamide metabolites , acrolein and 4 - hydroxy - ifosfamide , resulting in their detoxification .
The first step in the detoxification process is the binding of mesna to 4 - hydroxy - ifosfamide forming a non - urotoxic 4 - sulfoethylthioifosfamide .
Mesna also binds to the double bonds of acrolein and to other urotoxic metabolites and inhibits their effects on the bladder .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration , peak plasma concentrations were reached within 1 . 5 to 4 hours and 3 to 7 hours for free mesna and total mesna ( mesna plus dimesna and mixed disulfides ) , respectively .
Oral bioavailability averaged 58 % ( range 45 to 71 % ) for free mesna and 89 % ( range 74 to 104 % ) for total mesna based on plasma AUC data from 8 healthy volunteers who received 1200 mg oral or intravenous doses .
Food does not affect the urinary availability of orally administered MESNEX .
Distribution Mean apparent volume of distribution ( Vd ) for mesna is 0 . 652 ± 0 . 242 L / kg after intravenous administration which suggests distribution to total body water ( plasma , extracellular fluid , and intracellular water ) .
Metabolism Analogous to the physiological cysteine - cystine system , mesna is rapidly oxidized to its major metabolite , mesna disulfide ( dimesna ) .
Plasma concentrations of mesna exceed those of dimesna after oral or intravenous administration .
Excretion Following intravenous administration of a single 800 mg dose , approximately 32 % and 33 % of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours as mesna and dimesna , respectively .
Mean plasma elimination half - lives of mesna and dimesna are 0 . 36 hours and 1 . 17 hours , respectively .
Mesna has a plasma clearance of 1 . 23 L / h / kg .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No long - term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of mesna .
Mesna was not genotoxic in the in vitro Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay , the in vitro mammalian lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay or the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
No studies on male or female fertility were conducted .
No signs of male or female reproductive organ toxicity were seen in 6 - month oral rat studies ( ≤ 2000 mg / kg / day ) or 29 - week oral dog studies ( 520 mg / kg / day ) at doses approximately 10 - fold higher than the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Intravenous MESNEX Hemorrhagic cystitis produced by ifosfamide is dose dependent ( Table 4 ) .
At a dose of 1 . 2 g / m2 ifosfamide administered daily for 5 days , 16 to 26 % of the patients who received conventional uroprophylaxis ( high fluid intake , alkalinization of the urine , and the administration of diuretics ) developed hematuria ( > 50 RBC per hpf or macrohematuria ) ( Studies 1 , 2 , and 3 ) .
In contrast , none of the patients who received mesna injection together with this dose of ifosfamide developed hematuria ( Studies 3 and 4 ) .
In two randomized studies , ( Studies 5 and 6 ) , higher doses of ifosfamide , from 2 g / m2 to 4 g / m2 administered for 3 to 5 days , produced hematuria in 31 to 100 % of the patients .
When MESNEX was administered together with these doses of ifosfamide , the incidence of hematuria was less than 7 % .
