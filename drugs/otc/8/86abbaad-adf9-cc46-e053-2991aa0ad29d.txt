8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Based on animal data , may cause fetal harm .
( 8 . 1 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Risk Summary There are no adequate or well - controlled studies with phenylephrine hydrochloride injection in pregnant women , nor have animal reproduction studies been conducted .
Published studies in normotensive pregnant rabbits report early onset labor , increased fetal lethality , and adverse placental effects with subcutaneous phenylephrine administration during gestation at doses approximately 1 . 9 - times the total daily human dose .
Published studies in normotensive pregnant sheep report decreased uterine blood flow and decreased PaO 2 in the fetus with intravenous phenylephrine administration during late gestation at doses less than and similar to the human dose .
It is not known whether phenylephrine hydrochloride , can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Phenylephrine hydrochloride , should be given to a pregnant woman only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Clinical Considerations Labor and Delivery The most common maternal adverse reactions reported in published studies of phenylephrine use during neuraxial anesthesia during Cesarean delivery include nausea and vomiting , bradycardia , reactive hypertension , and transient arrhythmias .
Phenylephrine , when administered during labor or delivery , does not appear to alter either neonatal Apgar scores or umbilical artery blood - gas status .
Data Animal Data Studies in the published literature evaluating subcutaneously administered phenylephrine ( 0 . 33 mg / kg , TID ) in normotensive pregnant rabbits reported fetal deaths , adverse histopathology findings in the placenta ( necrosis , calcification and thickened vascular walls with narrowed lumen ) and possible teratogenic effects ( one incidence of clubbed feet , partial development of the intestine ) when treatment was initiated during the first trimester or later ; and premature labor when treatment was initiated at the second trimester or later .
The doses administered were 1 . 9 - times the total daily human dose of 10 mg / day based on a body surface area comparison .
Published studies in pregnant normotensive sheep demonstrate that intravenous phenylephrine ( 4 mcg / kg / min for 30 minutes , equivalent to 3 . 6 to 4 . 1 mcg / kg / min human equivalent dose based on body surface area ) administered during the third trimester of pregnancy decreased uterine blood flow by 42 % .
This dose is 1 . 1 - to 1 . 2 - times the human bolus dose of 200 mcg / 60 kg person based on body surface area .
Mean fetal blood pressure and heart rate fluctuated above and below controls by about 7 % during the infusion .
Fetal PaO 2 was significantly decreased by approximately 26 % of control during the infusion .
Likewise , PaCO 2 was increased and pH was decreased .
The clinical significance of these findings is not clear ; however , the results suggest the potential for cardiovascular effects on the fetus when phenylephrine is used during pregnancy .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether phenylephrine is present in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for phenylephrine hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition .
Exercise caution when phenylephrine hydrochloride injection is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of phenylephrine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment In patients with liver cirrhosis [ Child Pugh Class B and Class C ] , dose - response data indicate decreased responsiveness to phenylephrine .
Start dosing in the recommended dose range but consider that you may need to give more phenylephrine in this population .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment In patients with end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , dose - response data indicate increased responsiveness to phenylephrine .
Consider starting at the lower end of the recommended dose range , and adjusting dose based on the target blood pressure goal .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdose of phenylephrine hydrochloride can cause a rapid rise in blood pressure .
Symptoms of overdose include headache , vomiting , hypertension , reflex bradycardia , a sensation of fullness in the head , tingling of the extremities , and cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular extrasystoles and ventricular tachycardia .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Phenylephrine hydrochloride is an α - 1 adrenergic receptor agonist .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Interaction of phenylephrine with α1 - adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells causes activation of the cells and results in vasoconstriction .
Following phenylephrine hydrochloride intravenous administration , increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressures , mean arterial blood pressure , and total peripheral vascular resistance are observed .
The onset of blood pressure increase following an intravenous bolus phenylephrine hydrochloride administration is rapid , typically within minutes .
As blood pressure increases following intravenous administration , vagal activity also increases , resulting in reflex bradycardia .
Phenylephrine has activity on most vascular beds , including renal , pulmonary , and splanchnic arteries .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following an intravenous infusion of phenylephrine hydrochloride , the observed effective half - life was approximately 5 minutes .
The steady - state volume of distribution of approximately 340 L suggests a high distribution into organs and peripheral tissues .
The average total serum clearance is approximately 2100 mL / min .
The observed phenylephrine plasma terminal elimination half - life was 2 . 5 hours .
Phenylephrine is metabolized primarily by monoamine oxidase and sulfotransferase .
After intravenous administration of radiolabeled phenylephrine , approximately 80 % of the total dose was eliminated within first 12 hours ; and approximately 86 % of the total dose was recovered in the urine within 48 hours .
The excreted unchanged parent drug was 16 % of the total dose in the urine at 48 hours post intravenous administration .
There are two major metabolites , with approximately 57 and 8 % of the total dose excreted as m - hydroxymandelic acid and sulfate conjugates , respectively .
The metabolites are considered not pharmacologically active .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis : Long - term animal studies that evaluated the carcinogenic potential of orally administered phenylephrine hydrochloride in F344 / N rats and B6C3F 1 mice were completed by the National Toxicology Program using the dietary route of administration .
There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in mice administered approximately 270 mg / kg / day ( 131 - times the maximum recommended daily dose of < 10 mg / day ) or rats administered approximately 50 mg / kg / day ( 48 - times the maximum recommended daily dose of < 10 mg / day ) based on body surface area comparisons .
Mutagenesis : Phenylephrine hydrochloride tested negative in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay ( S . typhimurium strains TA98 , TA100 , TA1535 and TA1537 ) , the in vitro chromosomal aberrations assay , the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay , and the in vivo rat micronucleus assay .
Positive results were reported in only one of two replicates of the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay .
Impairment of Fertility : Studies to evaluate the effect of phenylephrine on fertility have not been conducted .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The evidence for the efficacy of phenylephrine hydrochloride is derived from studies of phenylephrine hydrochloride in the published literature .
The literature support includes 16 studies evaluating the use of intravenous phenylephrine to treat hypotension during anesthesia .
The 16 studies include 9 studies where phenylephrine was used in low - risk ( ASA 1 and 2 ) pregnant women undergoing neuraxial anesthesia during Cesarean delivery , 6 studies in non - obstetric surgery under general anesthesia , and 1 study in non - obstetric surgery under combined general and neuraxial anesthesia .
Phenylephrine has been shown to raise systolic and mean blood pressure when administered either as a bolus dose or by continuous infusion following the development of hypotension during anesthesia .
