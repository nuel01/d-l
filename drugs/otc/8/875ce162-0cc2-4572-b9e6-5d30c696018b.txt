8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available human data for the use of bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution during pregnancy to inform any drug - associated risks .
Oral administration of bepotastine besilate to pregnant rats or rabbits during organogenesis or during the pre / postnatal period did not produce adverse embryofetal or offspring effects at clinically relevant systemic exposures .
Maternal toxicity was observed in the rabbits at the lowest dose administered , 20 mg / kg / day ( 215 times the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose , RHOD , on a mg / m2 basis ) [ see Data ] .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
However , the background risk in the U . S . general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4 % , and of miscarriage is 15 to 20 % , of clinically recognized pregnancies .
Data Animal Data In embryofetal development studies , oral administration of bepotastine besilate to pregnant rabbits throughout organogenesis did not produce teratogenic effects at maternal doses up to 500 mg / kg / day ( approximately 5400 times the maximum RHOD , on a mg / m2 basis ) .
A maternal no observed adverse effect level ( NOAEL ) was not identified in this study due to spontaneous abortion observed at the lowest dose tested , 20 mg / kg / day ( approximately 215 times higher than the maximum RHOD , on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Oral administration of bepotastine besilate to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis produced skeletal anomalies at 1000 mg / kg / day ( 5400 times higher than the maximum RHOD , on a mg / m2 basis ) , a dose that also produced maternal toxicity and lethality .
No teratogenic effects were observed in rats at maternal doses up to 200 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to an estimated blood plasma concentration 3300 times higher than that anticipated in humans at the maximum RHOD ) .
A maternal NOAEL was observed at 10 mg / kg / day ( 54 times higher than the maximum RHOD , on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Following a single 3 mg / kg oral dose in rats ( 16 times higher than the maximum RHOD , on a mg / m2 basis ) , the concentration of radio - labeled bepotastine besilate was similar in fetal liver and maternal blood plasma .
The concentration in other fetal tissues was one - third to one - tenth the concentration in maternal blood plasma .
In a pre / postnatal development study , oral administration of bepotastine besilate to rats during the perinatal and lactation periods produced an increase in stillbirths and decreased growth and development in offspring at a maternal dose of 1000 mg / kg / day ( 5400 times higher than the maximum RHOD , on a mg / m2 basis ) .
There were no observed adverse effects on offspring of rats treated with 100 mg / kg / day ( 540 times higher than the maximum RHOD , on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Effects on parturition and maternal lethality were observed at 100 mg / kg / day and 1000 mg / kg / day , respectively .
A maternal NOAEL was observed at 10 mg / kg / day ( 54 times higher than the maximum RHOD , on a mg / m2 basis ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of bepotastine besilate in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered , along with the mother ’ s clinical need for bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution , and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution .
Animal Data Following a single 3 mg / kg oral dose ( 16 times the maximum RHOD , on a mg / m2 basis ) of radiolabeled bepotastine besilate to nursing rats 11 days after delivery , the maximum concentration of radioactivity in milk was 0 . 40 mcg - eq / mL 1 hour after administration ; at 48 hours after administration , the radioactivity concentration was below detection limits .
The milk radioactivity concentration was higher than the maternal blood plasma radioactivity concentration at each time of measurement .
It is not known whether bepotastine besilate would be present in maternal milk following topical ocular administration .

Efficacy in pediatric patients under 10 years of age was extrapolated from clinical trials conducted in pediatric patients greater than 10 years of age and from adults .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Bepotastine is a topically active , direct H1 - receptor antagonist and an inhibitor of the release of histamine from mast cells .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The extent of systemic exposure to bepotastine following topical ophthalmic administration of bepotastine besilate 1 % and 1 . 5 % ophthalmic solutions was evaluated in 12 healthy adults .
Following one drop of 1 % or 1 . 5 % bepotastine besilate ophthalmic solution to both eyes four times daily ( QID ) for 7 days , bepotastine plasma concentrations peaked at approximately 1 to 2 hours post - instillation .
Maximum plasma concentrations for the 1 % and 1 . 5 % strengths were 5 . 1 ± 2 . 5 ng / mL and 7 . 3 ± 1 . 9 ng / mL , respectively .
Plasma concentrations at 24 hours post - instillation were below the quantifiable limit ( 2 ng / mL ) in 11 / 12 subjects in the two dose groups .
Distribution The extent of protein binding of bepotastine is approximately 55 % and independent of bepotastine concentration .
Metabolism In vitro metabolism studies with human liver microsomes demonstrated that bepotastine is minimally metabolized by CYP450 isozymes .
In vitro studies demonstrated that bepotastine besilate does not inhibit the metabolism of various cytochrome P450 substrates via inhibition of CYP3A4 , CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 .
The effect of bepotastine besilate on the metabolism of substrates of CYP1A2 , CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 was not studied .
Bepotastine besilate has a low potential for drug interaction via inhibition of CYP3A4 , CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 .
Excretion The main route of elimination of bepotastine besilate is urinary excretion ( with approximately 75 - 90 % excreted unchanged in urine ) .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long - term dietary studies in mice and rats were conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of bepotastine besilate .
Bepotastine besilate did not significantly induce neoplasms in mice receiving a nominal dose of up to 200 mg / kg / day for 21 months , or rats receiving a nominal dose of up to 97 mg / kg / day for 24 months .
These dose levels correspond to systemic exposures approximately 350 and 200 times higher than that achieved at the RHOD , respectively .
The no observable adverse effect level for bepotastine besilate based on nominal dose levels in carcinogenicity tests were 18 . 7 to 19 . 9 mg / kg / day in mice and 9 . 6 to 9 . 8 mg / kg / day in rats ( corresponding to systemic exposures approximately 60 and 20 times higher than that anticipated in humans at RHOD , respectively ) .
Mutagenesis There was no evidence of genotoxicity in the Ames test ( mutagenicity ) , in CHO cells ( chromosome aberration ) , in mouse hepatocytes ( unscheduled DNA synthesis ) , or in the mouse micronucleus test .
Impairment of Fertility Oral administration of bepotastine to male and female rats at doses up to 1000 mg / kg / day ( 5400 times higher than the maximum RHOD , on a mg / m2 basis ) resulted in reduction in fertility index and surviving fetuses .
Oral administration of bepotastine besilate produced no observed adverse effects on fertility or reproduction in rats at oral doses up to 200 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to an estimated blood plasma concentration 3300 times higher than that anticipated in humans at the RHOD ) .
