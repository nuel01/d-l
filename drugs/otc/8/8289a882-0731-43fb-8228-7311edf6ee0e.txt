2 . 7 Image Interpretation Ga 68 dotatate binds to somatostatin receptors .
Based upon the intensity of the signals , PET images obtained using Ga 68 dotatate indicate the presence and density of somatostatin receptors in tissues .
Tumors that do not bear somatostatin receptors will not be visualized .
Increased uptake in tumors is not specific for NET [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 8 Radiation Dosimetry Estimated radiation absorbed doses per injection activity for organs and tissues of adult patients following an intravenous bolus of Ga 68 dotatate are shown in Table 3 .
Estimated radiation effective doses per injection activity for adult and pediatric patients following an intravenous bolus of Ga 68 dotatate are shown in Table 4 .
Gallium Ga 68 decays with a half - life of 68 minutes to stable zinc Zn 68 : • 89 % through positron emission with a mean energy of 836 keV followed by photonic annihilation radiations of 511 keV ( 178 % ) , • 10 % through orbital electron capture ( X - ray or Auger emissions ) , and • 3 % through 13 gamma transitions from 5 exited levels .
The effective radiation dose resulting from the administration of 150 MBq ( 4 . 05 mCi ) [ within the range of the recommended Ga 68 dotatate injection dose ] to an adult weighing 75 kg , is about 3 . 15 mSv .
For an administered activity of 150 MBq ( 4 . 05 mCi ) the typical radiation dose to the critical organs , which are the urinary bladder wall , the spleen and the kidneys / adrenals , are about 18 mGy , 16 mGy and 12 mGy , respectively .
Because the spleen has one of the highest physiological uptakes , higher uptake and radiation dose to other organs or pathologic tissues may occur in patients with spleen disorders ( e . g . , splenectomy and splenosis ) [ see Risk for Image Misinterpretation ( 5 . 3 ) ] .

( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Radiation Risk : Ga 68 dotatate contributes to a patient ’ s overall long - term cumulative radiation exposure .
Ensure safe handling and preparation procedures to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure .
Restrict close contact with infants and pregnant women during the first 12 hours after administration of Ga 68 dotatate .
( 5 . 1 ) • Hypersensitivity Reactions : Most reported reactions were rash and pruritis and reversible either spontaneously or with routine symptomatic management .
( 5 . 2 ) • Risk for Image Misinterpretation : The uptake of Ga 68 dotatate can be seen in a variety of tumor types other than NETs ( e . g . , those derived from neural crest tissue ) , in sites of splenosis or other pathologic conditions , and as a normal physiologic variant ( e . g . , uncinate process of the pancreas ) .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Radiation Risk Ga 68 dotatate contributes to a patient ’ s overall long - term cumulative radiation exposure .
Long - term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer .
Ensure safe handling and preparation reconstitution procedures to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Avoid close contact with infants and pregnant women during the first 12 hours after administration of Ga 68 dotatate .
5 . 2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions following administration of somatostatin receptor imaging agents predominantly consisted of cutaneous reactions , such as rash and pruritus .
Reactions reversed either spontaneously or with routine symptomatic management .
Less frequently hypersensitivity reactions included angioedema or cases with features of anaphylaxis .
5 . 3 Risk for Image Misinterpretation The uptake of Ga 68 dotatate reflects the level of somatostatin receptor density in NETs .
However , uptake can also be seen in a variety of other tumor types ( e . g . , those derived from neural crest tissue ) .
Increased uptake might also be seen in sites of splenosis or other pathologic conditions ( e . g . , thyroid disease or subacute inflammation ) or might occur as a normal physiologic variant ( e . g . , uncinate process of the pancreas ) .
PET images with Ga 68 dotatate should be interpreted visually and the uptake may need to be confirmed by histopathology or other assessments [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) ] .
A negative scan after the administration of Ga 68 dotatate in patients who do not have a history of NETs , including in patients suspected of ectopic ACTH - secreting tumors , does not rule out the presence of NETs .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • Hypersensitivity reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] Nausea , vomiting , and injection site pain and burning sensation were all reported during post - approval use .
( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation at 1 - 888 - 669 - 6682 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience The safety of Ga 68 dotatate was evaluated in three single center studies [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] and in a survey of the scientific literature .
No serious adverse reactions were identified .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of NETSPOT or other somatostatin receptor imaging agents .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to the drug .
Gastrointestinal Disorders : Nausea and vomiting General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : Injection site pain and burning sensation Immune System Disorders : Hypersensitivity reactions , predominantly rash , pruritus , less frequently angioedema or features of anaphylaxis .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Non - radioactive somatostatin analogs competitively bind to the same somatostatin receptors as Ga 68 dotatate .
Image patients with Ga 68 dotatate PET just prior to dosing with long - acting analogs of somatostatin .
Short - acting analogs of somatostatin can be used up to 24 hours before imaging with Ga 68 dotatate .
Corticosteroids can down - regulate somatostatin subtype 2 receptors .
Repeated administration of high doses of glucocorticoid prior to Ga 68 dotatate administration may result in false negative imaging .
Somatostatin Analogs : Somatostatin analogs competitively bind to the same somatostatin receptors as Ga 68 dotatate and may affect imaging – image just prior to dosing with long - acting somatostatin analogs .
( 7 ) Corticosteroids : Repeated administration of high doses of glucocorticosteroids prior to Ga 68 dotatate administration may affect imaging .
( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Breast milk should be pumped and discarded for 12 hours after administration .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies with Ga 68 dotatate in pregnant women to inform any drug - associated risks ; however , all radiopharmaceuticals , including Ga 68 dotatate have the potential to cause fetal harm .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Ga 68 dotatate .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of Ga 68 dotatate in human milk , the effect on the breastfed infant , or the effect on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for Ga 68 dotatate injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Ga 68 dotatate injection or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations Advise a lactating woman to interrupt breastfeeding and pump and discard breast milk for 12 hours after Ga 68 dotatate administration in order to minimize radiation exposure to a breastfed infant .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The efficacy of Ga 68 dotatate PET imaging in pediatric patients with neuroendocrine tumors is based on extrapolation from adult studies , from studies demonstrating the ability of Ga 68 dotatate to bind to somatostatin receptors [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] , and from a published study of Ga 68 dotatate PET imaging in pediatric patients with somatostatin receptor positive tumors .
The safety profile of Ga 68 dotatate is similar in adult and pediatric patients with somatostatin receptor positive tumors .
The recommended Ga 68 dotatate injection dose in pediatric patients is weight based as in adults [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Ga 68 dotatate injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over , to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of a radiation overdose , the absorbed dose to the patient should be reduced where possible by increasing the elimination of the radionuclide from the body by reinforced hydration and frequent bladder voiding .
A diuretic might also be considered .
If possible , an estimate of the radioactive dose given to the patient should be performed .

12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The relationship between Ga 68 dotatate plasma concentrations and successful imaging was not explored in clinical trials .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Ga 68 dotatate distributes to all sstr2 - expressing organs , such as pituitary , thyroid , spleen , adrenals , kidney , pancreas , prostate , liver , and salivary glands .
There is no uptake in the cerebral cortex or in the heart , and usually thymus and lung uptakes are low .
Elimination A total of 12 % of the injected dose is excreted in urine in the first four hours post - injection .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No animal studies on fertility , embryology , mutagenic potential , or carcinogenic potential have been conducted with Ga 68 dotatate .
However , genotoxicity studies conducted with a very similar molecule ( mixture Lu 175 dotatate / dotatate ) shows that these non - radioactive compounds do not induce mutation at the TK locus of L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells in vitro , nor reverse mutation in Salmonella typhimurium , or Escherichia coli ( both in the absence or presence of S9 metabolic activation ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of NETSPOT was established in three open label single center studies ( Study A - C ) .
In Study A , 97 adult patients ( mean age 54 ; 41 men and 56 women ) with known or suspected neuroendocrine tumors ( NETs ) were evaluated with Ga 68 dotatate PET .
The Ga 68 dotatate images were read by two independent readers blinded to clinical information .
The reads were compared to CT and / or MR images and to indium In 111 pentetreotide images obtained with Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT ) within previous 3 years .
Among 78 patients in whom CT and / or MR images and In 111 pentetreotide images were available , Ga 68 dotatate PET was in agreement with the CT and / or MR images in 74 patients .
Out of 50 patients with NETs localized by CT and / or MR imaging , Ga 68 dotatate was positive in 48 patients , including 13 patients in whom In 111 pentetreotide was negative .
Ga 68 dotatate was negative in 26 out of 28 patients in whom CT and / or MR imaging was negative .
Study B was a published study which involved 104 patients ( mean age 58 ; 52 men and 52 women ) with suspected NETs due to clinical symptoms , elevated levels of tumor markers , or indeterminate tumors suggestive of NET .
Diagnostic performance of Ga 68 dotatate PET in localizing tumor sites was retrospectively assessed using a reference standard : histopathology ( n = 49 ) or clinical follow up of up to 5 - month duration ( n = 55 ) .
Images were interpreted by consensus between two on - site readers who were not blinded to clinical information .
NET sites were localized by reference standard in 36 patients ( all by histopathology ) .
Out of these , Ga 68 dotatate was positive , correctly identifying an NET site , in 29 patients and was falsely negative in seven .
In 68 patients with no NET identified by a reference standard , the images were negative in 61 and falsely positive in seven patients .
Study C was a published study which involved 63 patients ( mean age 58 ; 34 men and 29 women ) evaluated for NET recurrence using a reference standard as described for Study B . Ga 68 dotatate images were interpreted independently by two central readers blinded to clinical information .
Reader 1 correctly localized NETs in 23 out of 29 reference standard - positive patients and reader 2 correctly localized NETs in 22 such patients .
In 34 patients with no NET identified by a reference standard , reader 1 was correct in 29 patients and reader 2 in 32 .
16 HOW SUPPLIED / STORAGE AND HANDLING 16 . 1 How Supplied NETSPOT is supplied as a single - dose kit ( NDC # 69488 - 001 - 40 ) for preparing a single dose of gallium 68 ( Ga 68 ) radiolabeled dotatate injection .
