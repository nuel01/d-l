RECENT MAJOR CHANGES Warnings and Precautions , Sedation ( 5 . 1 ) 10 / 2009 Warnings and precautions , Drug Dependence , Withdrawal , and Abuse ( 5 . 2 ) 10 / 2009 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Carisoprodol Tablets , USP are indicated for the relief of discomfort associated with acute , painful musculoskeletal conditions in adults .
Carisoprodol Tablets should only be used for short periods ( up to two or three weeks ) because adequate evidence of effectiveness for more prolonged use has not been established and because acute , painful musculoskeletal conditions are generally of short duration .
[ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 ) ] .
Carisoprodol Tablets , USP are indicated for the relief of discomfort associated with acute , painful musculoskeletal conditions .
( 1 ) Important Limitations : • Should only be used for acute treatment periods up to two or three weeks ( 1 ) • Not recommended in pediatric patients less than 16 years of age ( 8 . 4 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose of Carisoprodol Tablets is 350 mg three times a day and at bedtime .
The recommended maximum duration of Carisoprodol Tablets use is up to two or three weeks .
• Recommended dose is 350 mg three times a day and at bedtime ( 2 ) 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Carisoprodol Tablets , USP 350 mg are White , Round , Unscored Tablets Imprinted " WW 176 " .
Tablets : 350 mg ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Carisoprodol Tablets are contraindicated in patients with a history of acute intermittent porphyria or a hypersensitivity reaction to a carbamate such as meprobamate .
• Acute intermittent porphyria ( 4 ) • Hypersensitivity reactions to a carbamate such as meprobamate ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Due to sedative properties , may impair ability to perform hazardous tasks such as driving or operating machinery ( 5 . 1 ) • Additive sedative effects when used with other CNS depressants including alcohol ( 5 . 1 ) • Cases of Drug Dependence , Withdrawal , and Abuse ( 5 . 2 ) • Seizures ( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Sedation Carisoprodol Tablets have sedative properties ( in the low back pain trials , 13 % to 17 % of patients who received Carisoprodol Tablets experienced sedation compared to 6 % of patients who received placebo ) [ see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 . 1 ) ] and may impair the mental and / or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery .
There have been post - marketing reports of motor vehicle accidents associated with the use of Carisoprodol Tablets .
Since the sedative effects of Carisoprodol Tablets and other CNS depressants ( e . g . , alcohol , benzodiazepines , opioids , tricyclic antidepressants ) may be additive , appropriate caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously .
5 . 2 Drug Dependence , Withdrawal , and Abuse In the postmarketing experience with Carisoprodol Tablets , cases of dependence , withdrawal , and abuse have been reported with prolonged use .
Most cases of dependence , withdrawal , and abuse occurred in patients who have had a history of addiction or who used Carisoprodol Tablets in combination with other drugs with abuse potential .
However , there have been post - marketing adverse event reports of Carisoprodol Tablets - associated abuse when used without other drugs with abuse potential .
Withdrawal symptoms have been reported following abrupt cessation after prolonged use .
To reduce the chance of Carisoprodol Tablets dependence , withdrawal , or abuse , Carisoprodol Tablets should be used with caution in addiction - prone patients and in patients taking other CNS depressants including alcohol , and Carisoprodol Tablets should not be used more than two to three weeks for the relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort .
Carisoprodol Tablets and one of its metabolites , meprobamate ( a controlled substance ) , may cause dependence [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 3 Seizures There have been postmarketing reports of seizures in patients who received Carisoprodol Tablets .
Most of these cases have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses ( including drugs of abuse , illegal drugs , and alcohol ) [ see OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions ( incidence > 2 % ) are drowsiness , dizziness , and headache ( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact West - ward Pharmaceutical Corp . at 1 - 877 - 233 - 2001 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice .
The data described below are based on 1387 patients pooled from two double blind , randomized , multicenter , placebo controlled , one - week trials in adult patients with acute , mechanical , lower back pain [ see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14 ) ] .
In the study , patients were treated with 350 mg of Carisoprodol Tablets , or placebo three times a day and at bedtime for seven days .
The mean age was about 41 years old with 54 % females and 46 % males and 74 % Caucasian , 16 % Black , 9 % Asian , and 2 % other .
There were no deaths and there were no serious adverse reactions in the trial .
In the study , 2 . 7 % , 2 % , and 5 . 4 % , of patients treated with placebo and 350 mg of Carisoprodol Tablets , respectively , discontinued due to adverse events ; and 0 . 5 % , 0 . 5 % , and 1 . 8 % of patients treated with placebo and 350 mg of Carisoprodol Tablets , respectively , discontinued due to central nervous system adverse reactions .
Table 1 displays adverse reactions reported with frequencies greater than 2 % and more frequently than placebo in patients treated with Carisoprodol Tablets in the trial described above .
Table 1 – Patients with Adverse Reactions in Controlled Studies Adverse Reaction Placebo ( n = 560 ) n ( % ) Carisoprodol 350 mg ( n = 279 ) n ( % ) Drowsiness 31 ( 6 ) 47 ( 17 ) Dizziness 11 ( 2 ) 19 ( 7 ) Headache 11 ( 2 ) 9 ( 3 ) 6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following events have been reported during postapproval use of Carisoprodol Tablets .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Cardiovascular : Tachycardia , postural hypotension , and facial flushing [ see OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ) ] .
Central Nervous System : Drowsiness , dizziness , vertigo , ataxia , tremor , agitation , irritability , headache , depressive reactions , syncope , insomnia , and seizures [ see OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ) ] .
Gastrointestinal : Nausea , vomiting , and epigastric discomfort .
Hematologic : Leukopenia , pancytopenia .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CNS depressants ( e . g . , alcohol , benzodiazepines , opioids , tricyclic antidepressants ) - additive sedative effects ( 5 . 1 and 7 . 1 ) See 17 for PATIENT COUSELING INFORMATION Revised : 01 / 2012 7 . 1 CNS Depressants The sedative effects of Carisoprodol Tablets and other CNS depressants ( e . g . , alcohol , benzodiazepines , opioids , tricyclic antidepressants ) may be additive .
Therefore , caution should be exercised with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously .
Concomitant use of Carisoprodol Tablets and meprobamate , a metabolite of Carisoprodol Tablets , is not recommended [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
7 . 2 CYP2C19 Inhibitors and Inducers Carisoprodol is metabolized in the liver by CYP2C19 to form meprobamate [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Co - administration of CYP2C19 inhibitors , such as omeprazole or fluvoxamine , with Carisoprodol Tablets could result in increased exposure of carisoprodol and decreased exposure of meprobamate .
Co - administration of CYP2C19 inducers , such as rifampin or St . John ' s Wort , with Carisoprodol Tablets could result in decreased exposure of carisoprodol and increased exposure of meprobamate .
Low dose aspirin also showed induction effect on CYP2C19 .
The full pharmacological impact of these potential alterations of exposures in terms of either efficacy or safety of Carisoprodol Tablets is unknown .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy : Pregnancy Category C .
There are no data on the use of Carisoprodol Tablets during human pregnancy .
Animal studies indicate that carisoprodol crosses the placenta and results in adverse effects on fetal growth and postnatal survival .
The primary metabolite of carisoprodol , meprobamate , is an approved anxiolytic .
Retrospective , post - marketing studies do not show a consistent association between maternal use of meprobamate and an increased risk for particular congenital malformations .
Teratogenic effects : Animal studies have not adequately evaluated the teratogenic effects of carisoprodol .
There was no increase in the incidence of congenital malformations noted in reproductive studies in rats , rabbits , and mice treated with meprobamate .
Retrospective , post - marketing studies of meprobamate during human pregnancy were equivocal for demonstrating an increased risk of congenital malformations following first trimester exposure .
Across studies that indicated an increased risk , the types of malformations were inconsistent .
Nonteratogenic effects : In animal studies , carisoprodol reduced fetal weights , postnatal weight gain , and postnatal survival at maternal doses equivalent to 1 - 1 . 5 times the human dose ( based on a body surface area comparison ) .
Rats exposed to meprobamate in - utero showed behavioral alterations that persisted into adulthood .
For children exposed to meprobamate in - utero , one study found no adverse effects on mental or motor development or IQ scores .
Carisoprodol Tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus .
8 . 2 Labor and Delivery There is no information about the effects of Carisoprodol Tablets on the mother and the fetus during labor and delivery .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Very limited data in humans show that Carisoprodol Tablets is present in breast milk and may reach concentrations two to four times the maternal plasma concentrations .
In one case report , a breast - fed infant received about 4 - 6 % of the maternal daily dose through breast milk and experienced no adverse effects .
However , milk production was inadequate and the baby was supplemented with formula .
In lactation studies in mice , female pup survival and pup weight at weaning were decreased .
This information suggests that maternal use of Carisoprodol Tablets may lead to reduced or less effective infant feeding ( due to sedation ) and / or decreased milk production .
Caution should be exercised when Carisoprodol Tablets are administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The efficacy , safety , and pharmacokinetics of Carisoprodol Tablets in pediatric patients less than 16 years of age have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use The efficacy , safety , and pharmacokinetics of Carisoprodol Tablets in patients over 65 years old have not been established .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment The safety and pharmacokinetics of Carisoprodol Tablets in patients with renal impairment have not been evaluated .
Since Carisoprodol Tablets are excreted by the kidney , caution should be exercised if Carisoprodol Tablets are administered to patients with impaired renal function .
Carisoprodol is dialyzable by hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment The safety and pharmacokinetics of Carisoprodol Tablets in patients with hepatic impairment have not been evaluated .
Since Carisoprodol Tablets are metabolized in the liver , caution should be exercised if Carisoprodol Tablets are administered to patients with impaired hepatic function .
8 . 8 Patients with Reduced CYP2C19 Activity Patients with reduced CYP2C19 activity have higher exposure to carisoprodol .
Therefore , caution should be exercised in administration of Carisoprodol Tablets to these patients [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Carisoprodol Tablets are not a controlled substance [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Discontinuation of carisoprodol in animals or in humans after chronic administration can produce withdrawal signs , and there are published case reports of human carisoprodol dependence .
In vitro studies demonstrate that carisoprodol elicits barbiturate - like effects .
Animal behavior studies indicate that carisoprodol produces rewarding effects .
Monkeys self administer carisoprodol .
Drug discrimination studies using rats indicate that carisoprodol has positive reinforcing and discriminative effects similar to barbital , meprobamate , and chlordiazepoxide .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage of Carisoprodol Tablets commonly produces CNS depression .
Death , coma , respiratory depression , hypotension , seizures , delirium , hallucinations , dystonic reactions , nystagmus , blurred vision , mydriasis , euphoria , muscular incoordination , rigidity , and / or headache have been reported with Carisoprodol Tablets overdosage .
Many of the Carisoprodol Tablets overdoses have occurred in the setting of multiple drug overdoses ( including drugs of abuse , illegal drugs , and alcohol ) .
The effects of an overdose of Carisoprodol Tablets and other CNS depressants ( e . g . , alcohol , benzodiazepines , opioids , tricyclic antidepressants ) can be additive even when one of the drugs has been taken in the recommended dosage .
Fatal accidental and non - accidental overdoses of Carisoprodol Tablets have been reported alone or in combination with CNS depressants Treatment of Overdosage : Basic life support measures should be instituted as dictated by the clinical presentation of the Carisoprodol Tablets overdose .
Induced emesis is not recommended due to the risk of CNS and respiratory depression , which may increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia .
Gastric lavage should be considered soon after ingestion ( within one hour ) .
Circulatory support should be administered with volume infusion and vasopressor agents if needed .
Seizures should be treated with intravenous benzodiazepines and the reoccurrence of seizures may be treated with phenobarbital .
In cases of severe CNS depression , airway protective reflexes may be compromised and tracheal intubation should be considered for airway protection and respiratory support .
The following types of treatment have been used successfully with an overdose of meprobamate , a metabolite of Carisoprodol Tablets : activated charcoal ( oral or via nasogastric tube ) , forced diuresis , peritoneal dialysis , and hemodialysis ( carisoprodol is also dialyzable ) .
Careful monitoring of urinary output is necessary and overhydration should be avoided .
Observe for possible relapse due to incomplete gastric emptying and delayed absorption .
For more information on the management of an overdose of Carisoprodol Tablets , contact a Poison Control Center .
11 DESCRIPTION Carisoprodol Tablets are available as 350 mg round , white tablets .
Carisoprodol is a white , crystalline powder , having a mild , characteristic odor and a bitter taste .
It is slightly soluble in water ; freely soluble in alcohol , in chloroform , and in acetone ; and its solubility is practically independent of pH . Carisoprodol is present as a racemic mixture .
Chemically , carisoprodol is N - isopropyl - 2 - methyl - 2 - propyl - 1 , 3 - propanediol dicarbamate and the molecular formula is C12H24N2O4 , with a molecular weight of 260 . 33 .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Other Ingredients : colloidal silicon dioxide , lactose monohydrate , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose , methylcellulose , povidone , sodium lauryl sulfate , sodium starch glycolate , and stearic acid .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of carisoprodol in relieving discomfort associated with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions has not been clearly identified .
In animal studies , muscle relaxation induced by carisoprodol is associated with altered interneuronal activity in the spinal cord and in the descending reticular formation of the brain .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Carisoprodol is a centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxant that does not directly relax skeletal muscles .
A metabolite of carisoprodol , meprobamate , has anxiolytic and sedative properties .
The degree to which these properties of meprobamate contribute to the safety and efficacy of Carisoprodol Tablets is unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of carisoprodol and its metabolite meprobamate were studied in a crossover study of 24 healthy subjects ( 12 male and 12 female ) who received single doses of 350 mg Carisoprodol Tablets ( see Table 2 ) .
The Cmax of meprobamate was 2 . 5 ± 0 . 5 µg / mL ( mean ± SD ) after administration of a single 350 mg dose of Carisoprodol Tablets , which is approximately 30 % of the Cmax of meprobamate ( approximately 8 µg / mL ) after administration of a single 400 mg dose of meprobamate .
Table 2 .
Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Carisoprodol and Meprobamate ( Mean ± SD , n = 24 ) 350 mg Carisoprodol Tablets Carisoprodol Cmax ( µg / mL ) 1 . 8 ± 1 . 0 AUCinf ( µg * hr / mL ) 7 . 0 ± 5 . 0 Tmax ( hr ) 1 . 7 ± 0 . 8 T1 / 2 ( hr ) 2 . 0 ± 0 . 5 Meprobamate Cmax ( µg / mL ) 2 . 5 ± 0 . 5 AUCinf ( µg * hr / mL ) 46 ± 9 . 0 Tmax ( hr ) 4 . 5 ± 1 . 9 T1 / 2 ( hr ) 9 . 6 ± 1 . 5 Absorption : Absolute bioavailability of carisoprodol has not been determined .
The mean time to peak plasma concentrations ( Tmax ) of carisoprodol was approximately 1 . 5 to 2 hours .
Co - administration of a high - fat meal with Carisoprodol Tablets ( 350 mg tablet ) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of carisoprodol .
Therefore , Carisoprodol Tablets may be administered with or without food .
Metabolism : The major pathway of carisoprodol metabolism is via the liver by cytochrome enzyme CYP2C19 to form meprobamate .
This enzyme exhibits genetic polymorphism ( see Patients with Reduced CYP2C19 Activity below ) .
Elimination : Carisoprodol is eliminated by both renal and non - renal routes with a terminal elimination half - life of approximately 2 hours .
The half - life of meprobamate is approximately 10 hours .
Gender : Exposure of carisoprodol is higher in female than in male subjects ( approximately 30 - 50 % on a weight adjusted basis ) .
Overall exposure of meprobamate is comparable between female and male subjects .
Patients with Reduced CYP2C19 Activity : Carisoprodol Tablets should be used with caution in patients with reduced CYP2C19 activity .
Published studies indicate that patients who are poor CYP2C19 metabolizers have a 4 - fold increase in exposure to carisoprodol , and concomitant 50 % reduced exposure to meprobamate compared to normal CYP2C19 metabolizers .
The prevalence of poor metabolizers in Caucasians and African Americans is approximately 3 - 5 % and in Asians is approximately 15 - 20 % .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of carisoprodol .
Carisoprodol Tablets were not formally evaluated for genotoxicity .
In published studies , carisoprodol was mutagenic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell assay in the absence of metabolizing enzymes , but was not mutagenic in the presence of metabolizing enzymes .
Carisoprodol was clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay using Chinese hamster ovary cells with or without the presence of metabolizing enzymes .
Other types of genotoxic tests resulted in negative findings .
Carisoprodol was not mutagenic in the Ames reverse mutation assay using S . typhimurium strains with or without metabolizing enzymes , and was not clastogenic in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay of circulating blood cells .
Carisoprodol Tablets were not formally evaluated for effects on fertility .
Published reproductive studies of carisoprodol in mice found no alteration in fertility although an alteration in reproductive cycles characterized by a greater time spent in estrus was observed at a carisoprodol dose of 1200 mg / kg / day .
In a 13 - week toxicology study that did not determine fertility , mouse testes weight and sperm motility were reduced at a dose of 1200 mg / kg / day .
In both studies , the no effect level was 750 mg / kg / day , corresponding to approximately 2 . 6 times the human equivalent dosage of 350 mg four times a day , based on a body surface area comparison .
The significance of these findings for human fertility is not known .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of Carisoprodol Tablets for the relief of acute , idiopathic mechanical low back pain was evaluated in two , 7 - day , double blind , randomized , multicenter , placebo controlled , U . S . trials ( Studies 1 and 2 ) .
Patients had to be 18 to 65 years old and had to have acute back pain ( ≤ 3 days of duration ) to be included in the trials .
Patients with chronic back pain ; at increased risk for vertebral fracture ( e . g . , history of osteoporosis ) ; with a history of spinal pathology ( e . g . , herniated nucleus pulposis , spondylolisthesis or spinal stenosis ) ; with inflammatory back pain , or with evidence of a neurologic deficit were excluded from participation .
Concomitant use of analgesics ( e . g . , acetaminophen , NSAIDs , tramadol , opioid agonists ) , other muscle relaxants , botulinum toxin , sedatives ( e . g . , barbiturates , benzodiazepines , promethazine hydrochloride ) , and anti - epileptic drugs was prohibited .
In Study 1 , patients were randomized to one of two treatment groups ( i . e . , Carisoprodol Tablets 350 mg , or placebo ) .
In the study , patients received study medication three times a day and at bedtime for seven days .
The primary endpoints were the relief from starting backache and the global impression of change , as reported by patients , on Study Day 3 .
Both endpoints were scored on a 5 - point rating scale from 0 ( worst outcome ) to 4 ( best outcome ) in the study .
The proportion of patients who used concomitant acetaminophen , NSAIDs , tramadol , opioid agonists , other muscle relaxants , and benzodiazepines was similar in the treatment groups .
The results for the primary efficacy evaluations in the acute , low back pain studies are presented in Table 3 .
