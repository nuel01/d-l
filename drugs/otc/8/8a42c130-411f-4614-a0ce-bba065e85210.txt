( 2 . 2 ) • Take INQOVI on an empty stomach .
( 2 . 2 ) 2 . 1 Important Administration Information Do NOT substitute INQOVI for an intravenous decitabine product within a cycle .
Consider administering antiemetics prior to each dose to minimize nausea and vomiting [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 2 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosage of INQOVI is 1 tablet ( containing 35 mg decitabine and 100 mg cedazuridine ) orally once daily on Days 1 through 5 of each 28 - day cycle for a minimum of 4 cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
A complete or partial response may take longer than 4 cycles .
Instruct patients of the following : • Take INQOVI at the same time each day .
• Swallow tablets whole .
Do not cut , crush , or chew tablets .
• Do not consume food 2 hours before and 2 hours after each dose .
• Take one tablet a day for 5 days in each cycle .
If the patient misses a dose within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken , instruct patients to take the missed dose as soon as possible and then to resume the normal daily dosing schedule .
Extend the dosing period by one day for every missed dose to complete 5 daily doses for each cycle .
• Do not take an additional dose if vomiting occurs after INQOVI administration but continue with the next schedule dose .
INQOVI is a hazardous drug .
Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures . 1 2 . 3 Monitoring and Dosage Modifications for Adverse Reactions Hematologic Adverse Reactions Obtain complete blood cell counts prior to initiating INQOVI and before each cycle .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of intravenous decitabine .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : Differentiation syndrome Respiratory , Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders : Interstitial lung disease Cardiac Disorders : Cardiomyopathy 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs Metabolized by Cytidine Deaminase : Avoid coadministration with INQOVI .
( 7 ) 7 . 1 Effects of INQOVI on Other Drugs Drugs Metabolized by Cytidine Deaminase Cedazuridine is an inhibitor of the cytidine deaminase ( CDA ) enzyme .
Coadministration of INQOVI with drugs that are metabolized by CDA may result in increased systemic exposure with potential for increased toxicity of these drugs [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Avoid coadministration of INQOVI with drugs that are metabolized by CDA .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) • Infertility : Can impair fertility .
( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data , animal studies , and its mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] , INQOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
A single published case report of intravenous decitabine use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describes adverse developmental outcomes , including major birth defects ( structural abnormalities ) .
In animal reproduction studies , intravenous administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis at doses approximately 7 % of the recommended human dose on a body surface area ( mg / m2 ) basis caused adverse developmental outcomes , including increased embryo - fetal mortality , alterations to growth , and structural abnormalities ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data There are no available data on INQOVI use in pregnant women .
A single published case report of intravenous decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39 - year - old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation .
These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly , absence of nasal bone , mid - facial deformity , cleft lip and palate , polydactyly , and rocker - bottom feet .
The pregnancy was terminated .
Animal Data No reproductive or developmental toxicity studies have been conducted with INQOVI or cedazuridine .
In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal - related defects in the rat and / or mouse , which include growth suppression , exencephaly , defective skull bones , rib / sternabrae defects , phocomelia , digit defects , micrognathia , gastroschisis , and micromelia .
Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal central nervous system ( CNS ) and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus .
Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis ( Day 10 of gestation ) induces bone loss in offspring .
In mice exposed to single intraperitoneal decitabine injections ( 0 , 0 . 9 and 3 . 0 mg / m2 , approximately 2 % and 7 % of the recommended daily clinical dose , respectively ) over gestation Days 8 , 9 , 10 or 11 , no maternal toxicity was observed , but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg / m2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels .
The 3 mg / m2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day , including supernumerary ribs ( both dose levels ) , fused vertebrae and ribs , cleft palate , vertebral defects , hind - limb defects , and digital defects of fore - and hind - limbs .
In rats given a single intraperitoneal injection of 2 . 4 , 3 . 6 or 6 mg / m2 decitabine ( approximately 5 , 8 , or 13 % the daily recommended clinical dose , respectively ) on gestation Days 9 - 12 , no maternal toxicity was observed .
No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation Day 9 .
A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3 . 6 mg / m2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation Day 10 .
Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels , and induction of exophthalmia , exencephaly , and cleft palate were observed at 6 . 0 mg / m2 .
Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3 . 6 mg / m2 .
Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore - limb and hind - limb were noted at 6 mg / m2 .
The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg / m2 intraperitoneal injection ( approximately 7 % the recommended daily clinical dose ) on Day 10 of gestation .
Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points .
No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males .
Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age ( 36 % and 0 % pregnancy rate , respectively ) .
Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation Day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1 - generation .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of cedazuridine , decitabine , or their metabolites in human milk or on their effects on the breastfed child or milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with INQOVI and for 2 weeks after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential INQOVI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating INQOVI .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with INQOVI and for 6 months after the last dose .
Males Based on genotoxicity findings , advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with INQOVI and for 3 months after the last dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Based on findings of decitabine and cedazuridine in animals , INQOVI may impair male fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of INQOVI have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 208 patients in clinical studies who received INQOVI , 75 % were age 65 years and older , while 36 % were age 75 years and older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients age 65 years and older , 75 years and older , and younger patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dosage modification of INQOVI is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance [ CLcr ] of 30 to 89 mL / min based on Cockcroft - Gault ) .
Due to the potential for increased adverse reactions , monitor patients with moderate renal impairment ( CLcr 30 to 59 mL / min ) frequently for adverse reactions .
INQOVI has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr 15 to 29 mL / min ) or end - stage renal disease ( ESRD : CLcr < 15 mL / min ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor that is believed to exert its effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase , causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation and / or apoptosis .
Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro , which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis .
Decitabine - induced hypomethylation in cancer cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation .
In rapidly dividing cells , the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA .
Non - proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine .
Cytidine deaminase ( CDA ) is an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of cytidine , including the cytidine analog decitabine .
High levels of CDA in the gastrointestinal tract and liver degrade decitabine and limit its oral bioavailability .
Cedazuridine is a CDA inhibitor .
Administration of cedazuridine with decitabine increases systemic exposure of decitabine .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine induced hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo .
In patients administered the recommended dosage of INQOVI , the maximum change from baseline in the long interspersed nucleotide elements - 1 ( LINE - 1 ) demethylation was observed at Day 8 , with less than complete recovery of LINE - 1 methylation to baseline at the end of the treatment cycle .
Based on the exposure - response analyses , a relationship between an increase in 5 - day cumulative daily decitabine exposure and a greater likelihood of some adverse reactions ( e . g . , any grade neutropenias , thrombocytopenia ) was observed in clinical studies .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of decitabine and cedazuridine following administration of INQOVI at the recommended dosage in patients with MDS and CMML are shown in Table 4 .
The geometric mean ratio ( GMR ) of decitabine area under the curve ( AUC ) following the first dose of INQOVI compared to that of intravenous decitabine on Day 1 was 60 % ( 90 % confidence intervals ( CI ) : 55 , 65 ) in patients with MDS and CMML [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
The GMR of decitabine AUC following 5 consecutive once daily doses of INQOVI compared to that of intravenous decitabine on Day 5 was 106 % ( 90 % CI : 98 , 114 ) and the GMR of the 5 - day cumulative decitabine AUC following 5 consecutive once daily doses of INQOVI compared to that of intravenous decitabine was 99 % ( 90 % CI : 93 , 106 ) .
An approximately dose - proportional increase in peak concentrations ( Cmax ) and AUC over the dosing interval was observed for decitabine following administration of oral decitabine at 20 mg to 40 mg once daily ( 0 . 6 to 1 . 1 times the recommended dose ) in combination with 100 mg oral cedazuridine , and for cedazuridine following administration of oral cedazuridine at 40 to 100 mg once daily ( 0 . 4 to 1 . 0 times the recommended dose ) in combination with 20 mg oral decitabine .

Decitabine exposure ( AUC ) increased with decreasing body surface area or body weight , and cedazuridine exposure increased with decreasing CLcr ; however , body surface area ( 1 . 3 to 2 . 9 m2 ) , body weight ( 41 to 158 kg ) , and mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr 30 to 89 mL / min based on Cockcroft Gault ) did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of decitabine and cedazuridine after dosing with INQOVI .
The effects of moderate ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 to 3 × ULN and any AST ) and severe hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 3 × ULN and any AST ) or severe renal impairment ( CLcr 15 to < 30 mL / min ) and ESRD ( CLcr < 15 mL / min ) on the pharmacokinetics of decitabine and cedazuridine are unknown .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Decitabine had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of cedazuridine .
Cedazuridine increased the exposure of decitabine .
The coadministration of INQOVI with proton pump inhibitors had no clinically meaningful effect on exposure to decitabine or cedazuridine .
In vitro Studies CYP Enzymes : Cedazuridine is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes .
Cedazuridine does not induce CYP1A , CYP2B6 , CYP2C9 , or CYP3A or inhibit CYP1A , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 , or CYP3A .
Transporter Systems : Cedazuridine is not a substrate of P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) , MATE1 , MATE2 - K , OAT1 , OAT3 , OATP1B1 , OAPT1B3 , OATP2B1 , OCT1 , or OCT2 , and does not inhibit P - gp , BCRP , MATE1 , MATE2 - K , OAT1 , OAT3 , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , or OCT2 .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with decitabine , cedazuridine , or their combination have not been conducted .
INQOVI is genotoxic .
Decitabine increased mutation frequency in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells , and mutations were produced in an E . coli lac - I transgene in colonic DNA of decitabine - treated mice .
Decitabine also caused chromosomal rearrangements in larvae of fruit flies .
Cedazuridine was genotoxic in a reverse bacterial mutation assay ( Ames assay ) and in an in vitro chromosomal aberration study using human lymphocytes .
Fertility and repeat - dose toxicity studies in animals showed adverse outcomes on reproductive function and fertility .
In male mice given intraperitoneal injections of 0 . 15 , 0 . 3 , or 0 . 45 mg / m2 decitabine ( approximately 0 . 3 % to 1 % the recommended clinical dose ) 3 times a week for 7 weeks , testes weights were reduced , abnormal histology was observed , and significant decreases in sperm number were found at doses ≥ 0 . 3 mg / m2 .
In females mated to males dosed with ≥ 0 . 3 mg / m2 decitabine , pregnancy rate was reduced , and preimplantation loss was significantly increased .
Decitabine was administered orally to rats at 0 . 75 , 2 . 5 , or 7 . 5 mg / kg / day in cycles of 5 - days - on / 23 - days - off for a total of 90 days .
Low testes and epididymis weights , abnormal histology , and reduced sperm number were observed at doses ≥ 0 . 75 mg / kg .
The dose of 0 . 75 mg / kg resulted in exposures in animals that were approximately 3 times the exposure in patients at the recommended clinical dose based on AUC .
Cedazuridine was administered orally to mice at 100 , 300 , or 1 , 000 mg / kg / day in cycles of 7 - days - on / 21 - days - off for a total of 91 days .
Adverse findings in male and female reproductive organs were observed at the 1 , 000 mg / kg dose and included abnormal histology in the testes and epididymis , reduced sperm number , and abnormal histology in the ovary .
The dose of 1 , 000 mg / kg / day resulted in exposures in animals that were approximately 108 times the exposure in patients at the recommended clinical dose .
Adverse effects in male and female reproductive organs were reversible following a recovery period .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Study ASTX727 - 01 - B INQOVI was evaluated in Study ASTX727 - 01 - B , an open - label , randomized , 2 - cycle , 2 - sequence crossover study ( NCT02103478 ) that included 80 adult patients with MDS ( International Prognostic Scoring System [ IPSS ] Intermediate - 1 , Intermediate - 2 , or high - risk ) or CMML .
