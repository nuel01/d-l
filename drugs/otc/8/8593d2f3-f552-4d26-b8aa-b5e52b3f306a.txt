11 DESCRIPTION 11 . 1 Chemical Characteristics Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection is a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical , containing no - carrier - added , radioactive fluoride F18 that is used for diagnostic purposes in conjunction with PET imaging .
It is administered by intravenous injection .
The active ingredient , sodium fluoride F18 , has the molecular formula Na [ 18 F ] with a molecular weight of 40 . 99 , and has the following chemical structure : Na + 18 F - Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection is provided as a ready - to - use , isotonic , sterile , pyrogen - free , preservative - free , clear and colorless solution .
Each mL of the solution contains between 370 MBq to 7 , 400 MBq ( 10 mCi to 200 mCi ) sodium fluoride F18 , at the EOS reference time , in 0 . 9 % aqueous sodium chloride .
The pH of the solution is between 4 . 5 and 8 .
The solution is presented in 30 mL multiple - dose glass vials with variable total volume and total radioactivity in each vial .
11 . 2 Physical Characteristics Fluoride F18 decays by positron ( β + ) emission and has a half - life of 109 . 7 minutes .
Ninety - seven percent of the decay results in emission of a positron with a maximum energy of 633 keV and 3 % of the decay results in electron capture with subsequent emission of characteristic X - rays of oxygen .
The principal photons useful for diagnostic imaging are the 511 keV gamma photons , resulting from the interaction of the emitted positron with an electron ( Table 2 ) .
Fluorine F18 atom decays to stable 18 O - oxygen .

The specific gamma ray constant ( point source air kerma coefficient ) for fluoride F18 is 5 . 7 R / hr / mCi ( 1 . 35 x 10 - 6 Gy / hr / kBq ) at 1 cm .
The half - value layer ( HVL ) for the 511 keV photons is 4 mm lead ( Pb ) .
A range of values for the attenuation of radiation results from the interposition of various thickness of Pb .
The range of attenuation coefficients for this radionuclide is shown in Table 3 .
For example , the interposition of an 8 mm thickness of Pb with a coefficient of attenuation of 0 . 25 will decrease the external radiation by 75 % .
