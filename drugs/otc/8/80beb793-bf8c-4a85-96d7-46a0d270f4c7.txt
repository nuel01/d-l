( 6 ) 6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety of REBYOTA was evaluated in 2 randomized , double - blind clinical studies ( Study 1 : NCT03244644 and Study 2 : NCT02299570 ) and 3 open - label clinical studies ( NCT01925417 , NCT02589847 , NCT03931941 ) conducted in the United States and Canada .
A total of 978 adults 18 years of age and older with a history of 1 or more recurrences of Clostridioides difficile ( CDI ) infection and whose symptoms were controlled 24 – 72 hours post - antibiotic treatment were enrolled and received 1 or more doses of REBYOTA ; 595 of whom received a single dose of REBYOTA .
In the 2 randomized , double - blind clinical studies , 131 adults were originally randomized to receive placebo and 48 crossed over to receive an open - label dose of REBYOTA after additional CDI recurrence .
Overall , across the 5 studies , the median age of participants was 64 years and 67 . 2 % were female .
The racial and ethnic distribution was as follows : 93 . 8 % were white , and 2 . 4 % were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity .
No meaningful differences in demographic characteristics occurred across the treatment groups .
Study 1 and Study 2 excluded individuals with celiac disease , Inflammatory Bowel Disease , Irritable Bowel Syndrome , and chronic diarrhea .
Individuals with these conditions were not excluded from one of the open - label studies ( NCT03931941 ) , and individuals with food allergies were not excluded from any of the 5 clinical studies .
Adverse Reactions Across the 5 clinical studies , participants recorded solicited adverse events in a diary for the first 7 days after each dose of REBYOTA or placebo .
Participants were monitored for all other adverse events by queries during scheduled visits , with duration of follow - up ranging from 6 to 24 months after the last dose .
In Study 1 , a multi - center , double - blind randomized ( 2 : 1 ) , placebo - controlled trial conducted in the United States and Canada , 180 adults 18 years of age and older received a single dose of REBYOTA and 87 received placebo .
Participants with a recurrence of CDI ( rCDI ) during the first 8 weeks after receipt of REBYOTA or placebo were censored from analysis at the time of rCDI .
During the first two weeks following a dose of REBYOTA or placebo , 34 participants ( 18 . 9 % ) and 24 participants ( 27 . 6 % ) respectively , were censored .
Overall , during the 8 week follow up period , 47 REBYOTA recipients ( 26 . 1 % ) and 30 placebo recipients ( 34 . 5 % ) were censored from analysis .
In an analysis of solicited and unsolicited adverse events reported in Study 1 , the most common adverse reactions ( defined as adverse events assessed as definitely , possibly , or probably related to Investigational Product by the investigator ) reported by ≥ 3 % of REBYOTA recipients , and at a rate greater than that reported by placebo recipients , were abdominal pain , ( 8 . 9 % ) , diarrhea ( 7 . 2 % ) , abdominal distention ( 3 . 9 % ) , flatulence ( 3 . 3 % ) , and nausea ( 3 . 3 % ) ( Table 1 ) .
Table 1 : Adverse Reactions [ 1 ] reported by ≥ 3 % of REBYOTA recipients , and at a rate greater than that reported by placebo recipients , within 8 weeks after receipt of REBYOTA or placebo ( Study 1 ) .
Adverse Reaction REBYOTA N = 180 n ( % ) Placebo N = 87 n ( % ) Abdominal Pain 16 ( 8 . 9 ) 6 ( 6 . 9 ) Diarrhea 13 ( 7 . 2 ) 3 ( 3 . 4 ) Abdominal distension 7 ( 3 . 9 ) 2 ( 2 . 3 ) Flatulence 6 ( 3 . 3 ) 0 Nausea 6 ( 3 . 3 ) 1 ( 1 . 1 ) [ 1 ] Adverse reactions were defined as solicited and unsolicited adverse events that were assessed as definitely , possibly or probably related to treatment by the study investigator .
Most adverse reactions occurred during the first 2 weeks after treatment .
After this , the proportion of patients with adverse reactions declined in subsequent 2 - week intervals .
Beyond 2 weeks after treatment only a few single adverse reactions were reported .
Most adverse drug reactions were mild to moderate in severity .
No life - threatening adverse reaction was reported .
Serious Adverse Reactions In a pooled analysis of the 5 clinical studies , 10 . 1 % ( 60 / 595 ) of REBYOTA recipients ( 1 dose only ) and 7 . 2 % ( 6 / 83 ) of placebo recipients reported a serious adverse event within 6 months post last dose of investigational product .
None of these events were considered related to the investigational product .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary REBYOTA is not absorbed systemically following rectal administration , and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug .
8 . 2 Lactation REBYOTA is not absorbed systemically by the mother following rectal administration , and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to REBYOTA .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of REBYOTA in individuals younger than 18 years of age have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 978 adults who received REBYOTA , 48 . 8 % were 65 years of age and over ( n = 477 ) , and 25 . 7 % were 75 years of age and over ( n = 251 ) .
Data from clinical studies of REBYOTA are not sufficient to determine if adults 65 years of age and older respond differently than younger adults .
11 DESCRIPTION REBYOTA ( fecal microbiota , live – jslm ) is an opaque fecal microbiota suspension for rectal administration .
REBYOTA is manufactured from human fecal matter sourced from qualified donors .
The human fecal matter is tested for a panel of transmissible pathogens .
Donors do not have dietary restrictions with respect to potential food allergens .
The fecal microbiota suspension is the filtrate generated by processing the fecal matter in a pre - defined ratio with a solution of polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) 3350 and saline .
Each 150 mL dose of REBYOTA contains between 1 × 108 and 5 × 1010 colony forming units ( CFU ) per mL of fecal microbes including > 1 × 105 CFU / mL of Bacteroides , and contains not greater than 5 . 97 grams of PEG3350 in saline .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of REBYOTA has not been established .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY No nonclinical toxicology studies were conducted .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The effectiveness of REBYOTA was evaluated using a Bayesian analysis of data from a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , multicenter Phase 3 study ( Study 1 ) , which formally integrated treatment success rates from a placebo - controlled Phase 2 study ( Study 2 ) .
Enrolled adults in both studies were 18 years of age or older and had a confirmed diagnosis of recurrent CDI ( one or more episodes in Study 1 ; two or more episodes in Study 2 ) which was defined as diarrhea ( passage of 3 or more loose bowel movements within a 24 - hour period for 2 consecutive days ) and a positive stool test for C . difficile toxin or toxigenic C . difficile , or had at least two episodes of severe CDI resulting in hospitalization within the last year .
Enrolled adults were required to have completed at least 10 consecutive days of antibiotic therapy and have their CDI under control ( < 3 unformed / loose , i . e . , Bristol Stool Scale type 6 - 7 , stools / day for 2 consecutive days ) .
A minimum of 24 hours to a maximum of 72 hours ( Study 1 ) or 24 hours to a maximum of 48 hours ( Study 2 ) antibiotic washout period was required prior to administration of the assigned study treatment .
In Study 1 , enrolled adults were randomized 2 : 1 to a single dose of REBYOTA or placebo respectively .
In Study 2 , randomization was 1 : 1 : 1 to receive two doses of REBYOTA , two doses of placebo , or one dose of REBYOTA and one dose of placebo , administered 7 ± 2 days apart .
Only data from the REBYOTA one - dose group and the placebo group are described below and were integrated in the Bayesian analysis .
In the integrated efficacy analysis set , the demographic profile and baseline recurrent CDI characteristics of treated adults were similar in the REBYOTA and placebo groups .
In Study 1 , a total of 262 adults were randomized and treated , of which 177 adults received REBYOTA and 85 received placebo .
Adults had a mean age of 60 . 1 years with 45 . 4 % of adults 65 years of age or older , were mainly white ( 92 . 0 % ) and female ( 69 . 1 % ) .
In this study , 32 . 8 % of adults received REBYOTA or placebo for their first recurrence of CDI .
In Study 1 , 87 . 4 % of adults had received vancomycin alone prior to treatment .
In Study 2 , 39 adults received one dose of REBYOTA and one dose of placebo and 43 adults received two doses of placebo .
Adults in these two groups had a mean age of 59 . 8 years with 42 . 7 % of adults 65 years of age or older , were mainly white ( 97 . 6 % ) and female ( 63 . 4 % ) .
In this study , 89 . 0 % of adults had received vancomycin prior to treatment .
Treatment success was defined as the absence of CDI diarrhea within 8 weeks of blinded treatment .
CDI diarrhea was defined as the passage of ≥ 3 unformed / loose stools in ≤ 24 hours for at least 2 consecutive days and a positive stool test for the presence of C difficile toxin at the time of the diarrhea .
In the Bayesian analysis , the estimated rate of treatment success was significantly higher in the REBYOTA group ( 70 . 6 % ) than in the Placebo group ( 57 . 5 % ) through 8 weeks after completing blinded treatment , resulting in a difference of 13 . 1 percentage points ( 95 % Credible Interval : 2 . 3 , 24 . 0 ) which corresponds to a 99 . 1 % posterior probability that REBYOTA is superior to Placebo ( Table 2 ) .
Table 2 : Efficacy Results : Treatment Success at 8 weeks Post - Treatment ( mITT Population [ 1 ] ) Parameter REBYOTA Mean ( 95 % CrI ) Placebo Mean ( 95 % CrI ) Treatment Effect ( REBYOTA – Placebo ) Mean ( 95 % CrI ) CrI = credible interval Model - Estimated Treatment Success ( % ) 70 . 6 ( 64 . 1 , 76 . 8 ) 57 . 5 ( 48 . 1 , 67 . 1 ) 13 . 1 ( 2 . 3 , 24 . 0 ) Posterior Probability of Superiority - - 0 . 991 [ 2 ] [ 1 ] mITT includes all randomized subjects excluding : 1 ) those who withdrew prior to treatment ; 2 ) those in whom treatment was attempted but not completed ; 3 ) those who discontinued from the study prior to evaluation of treatment outcome for the primary endpoint if the reason for exit was not related to CDI symptoms .
[ 2 ] Pre - defined threshold was 0 . 975 Study 1 evaluated sustained clinical response which was defined as treatment success at 8 weeks and no CDI event through 6 months after the last dose during the blinded period .
The difference in sustained clinical response rate ( 9 . 1 % ; 95 % CI : - 3 . 6 % , 21 . 7 % ) was not statistically significant between the REBYOTA ( 65 . 5 % ) and the placebo groups ( 56 . 5 % ) .
