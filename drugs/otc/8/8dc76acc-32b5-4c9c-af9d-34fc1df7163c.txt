6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions in clinical practice .
Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , estimates of frequency cannot be made .
The reactions , which have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness , frequency of reporting , possible causal connection to brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions , or a combination of these factors , include : • • Bradycardia ; conjunctivitis ; hypersensitivity ; hypotension ; iritis ; keratoconjunctivitis sicca ; lacrimation increased ; miosis ; nausea ; skin reactions ( including erythema , eyelid pruritus , rash , and vasodilation ) ; and tachycardia .
• • Apnea , bradycardia , coma , hypotension , hypothermia , hypotonia , lethargy , pallor , respiratory depression , and somnolence in infants receiving brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solutions .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • • Antihypertensives / cardiac glycosides may lower blood pressure .
( 7 . 1 ) • • Use with CNS depressants may result in an additive or potentiating effect .
( 7 . 2 ) • • Tricyclic antidepressants may potentially blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine .
( 7 . 3 ) • • Monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in increased hypotension .
( 7 . 4 ) 7 . 1 Antihypertensives / Cardiac Glycosides Because brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution may reduce blood pressure , caution in using drugs such as antihypertensives and / or cardiac glycosides with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is advised .
7 . 2 CNS Depressants Although specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution , the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants ( alcohol , barbiturates , opiates , sedatives , or anesthetics ) should be considered .
7 . 3 Tricyclic Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine .
It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in humans can lead to resulting interference with the IOP lowering effect .
Caution is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines .
7 . 4 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side - effect such as hypotension .
Caution is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Use with caution in children ≥ 2 years of age .
( 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B : Teratogenicity studies have been performed in animals .
Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given orally during gestation days 6 through 15 in rats and days 6 through 18 in rabbits .
The highest doses of brimonidine tartrate in rats ( 2 . 5 mg / kg / day ) and rabbits ( 5 mg / kg / day ) achieved AUC exposure values 375 - fold higher or 19 - fold higher , respectively , than similar values estimated in humans treated with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0 . 2 % , one drop in one eye , twice daily .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women ; however , in animal studies , brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk , although in animal studies , brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution in nursing infants , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in children under the age of 2 years [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 1 ) ] .
During postmarketing surveillance , apnea , bradycardia , coma , hypotension , hypothermia , hypotonia , lethargy , pallor , respiratory depression , and somnolence have been reported in infants receiving brimonidine .
The safety and effectiveness of brimonidine tartrate have not been studied in children below the age of 2 years .
In a well - controlled clinical study conducted in pediatric glaucoma patients ( ages 2 to 7 years ) the most commonly observed adverse reactions with brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0 . 2 % dosed three times daily were somnolence ( 50 - 83 % in patients ages 2 to 6 years ) and decreased alertness .
In pediatric patients 7 years of age ( greater than 20 kg ) , somnolence appears to occur less frequently ( 25 % ) .
Approximately 16 % of patients on brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0 . 2 % discontinued from the study due to somnolence .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients .
8 . 6 Special Populations Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment .
Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution has not been studied in patients with renal impairment .
The effect of dialysis on brimonidine pharmacokinetics in patients with renal failure is not known .
10 OVERDOSAGE Very limited information exists on accidental ingestion of brimonidine in adults ; the only adverse reaction reported to date has been hypotension .
Symptoms of brimonidine overdose have been reported in neonates , infants , and children receiving brimonidine tartrate as part of medical treatment of congenital glaucoma or by accidental oral ingestion [ see Use In Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Treatment of an oral overdose includes supportive and symptomatic therapy ; a patent airway should be maintained .
11 DESCRIPTION Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0 . 2 % , sterile , is a relatively selective alpha - 2 adrenergic receptor agonist ( topical intraocular pressure lowering agent ) .

It has an osmolality of 270 - 325 mOsml / kg and a pH range between 5 . 8 and 6 . 6 .
Each mL contains ACTIVE : brimonidine tartrate : 0 . 2 % ( 2 mg / mL ) .
INACTIVES : citric acid , polyvinyl alcohol , purified water , sodium chloride , sodium citrate , hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH . PRESERVATIVE ADDED : benzalkonium chloride 0 . 005 % ( 0 . 05 mg / mL ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0 . 2 % is a relatively selective alpha - 2 adrenergic receptor agonist with a peak ocular hypotensive effect occurring at two hours post - dosing .
Fluorophotometric studies in animals and humans suggest that brimonidine tartrate has a dual mechanism of action by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After ocular administration of a 0 . 2 % solution , plasma concentrations peaked within 1 to 4 hours and declined with a systemic half - life of approximately 3 hours .
Distribution The protein binding of brimonidine has not been studied .
Metabolism In humans , brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver .
Excretion Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites .
Approximately 87 % of an orally - administered radioactive dose of brimonidine was eliminated within 120 hours , with 74 % found in the urine .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No compound - related carcinogenic effects were observed in either mice or rats following a 21 - month and 24 - month study , respectively .
In these studies , dietary administration of brimonidine tartrate at doses up to 2 . 5 mg / kg / day in mice and 1 . 0 mg / kg / day in rats achieved ~ 77 and 118 times , respectively , the plasma Cmax drug concentration estimated in humans treated with one drop brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0 . 2 % into both eyes 2 times per day .
Brimonidine tartrate was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies including the Ames bacterial reversion test , chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cells , and three in vivo studies in CD - 1 mice : a host - mediated assay , cytogenetic study , and dominant lethal assay .
A reproduction and fertility study in rats with brimonidine tartrate demonstrated no adverse effect on male or female fertility at oral doses up to 1 mg / kg , estimated as approximately 200 times the systemic exposure ( AUC ) following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Elevated IOP presents a major risk factor in glaucomatous field loss .
The higher the level of IOP , the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss .
Brimonidine tartrate has the action of lowering intraocular pressure with minimal effect on cardiovascular and pulmonary parameters .
In comparative clinical studies with timolol 0 . 5 % , lasting up to one year , the IOP lowering effect of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution was approximately 4 - 6 mm Hg compared with approximately 6 mm Hg for timolol .
In these studies , both patient groups were dosed BID ; however , due to the duration of action of brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution , it is recommended that brimonidine tartrate ophthalmic solution be dosed TID .
Eight percent of subjects were discontinued from studies due to inadequately controlled intraocular pressure , which in 30 % of these patients occurred during the first month of therapy .
Approximately 20 % were discontinued due to adverse experiences .
