DESCRIPTION PLASMA - LYTE 148 Injection ( Multiple Electrolytes Injection , Type 1 , USP ) is a sterile , nonpyrogenic isotonic solution in a single dose container for intravenous administration .
Each 100 mL contains 526 mg of Sodium Chloride , USP ( NaCl ) ; 502 mg of Sodium Gluconate ( C6H11NaO7 ) ; 368 mg of Sodium Acetate Trihydrate , USP ( C2H3NaO2 • 3H2O ) ; 37 mg of Potassium Chloride , USP ( KCl ) ; and 30 mg of Magnesium Chloride , USP ( MgCl2 • 6H2O ) .
It contains no antimicrobial agents .
The pH is adjusted with hydrochloric acid .
The pH is 5 . 5 ( 4 . 0 to 8 . 0 ) .
PLASMA - LYTE 148 Injection ( Multiple Electrolytes Injection , Type 1 , USP ) administered intravenously has value as a source of water , electrolytes , and calories .
One liter has an ionic concentration of 140 mEq sodium , 5 mEq potassium , 3 mEq magnesium , 98 mEq chloride , 27 mEq acetate , and 23 mEq gluconate .
The osmolarity is 294 mOsmol / L ( calc ) .
Normal physiologic osmolarity range is approximately 280 to 310 mOsmol / L .

The VIAFLEX plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinyl chloride ( PL 146 Plastic ) .
The amount of water that can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period , e . g . , di - 2 - ethylhexyl phthalate ( DEHP ) , up to 5 parts per million .
However , the safety of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY PLASMA - LYTE 148 Injection ( Multiple Electrolytes Injection , Type 1 , USP ) has value as a source of water and electrolytes .
It is capable of inducing diuresis depending on the clinical condition of the patient .
PLASMA - LYTE 148 Injection ( Multiple Electrolytes Injection , Type 1 , USP ) produces a metabolic alkalinizing effect .
