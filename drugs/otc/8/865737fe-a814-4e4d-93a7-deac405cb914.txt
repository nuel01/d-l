Fulvestrant injection , an injection for intramuscular administration , is supplied as 250 mg / 5 mL fulvestrant .
( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Fulvestrant injection is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or to any of its components .
Hypersensitivity reactions , including urticaria and angioedema , have been reported in association with fulvestrant [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
• Hypersensitivity .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Risk of Bleeding : Use with caution in patients with bleeding diatheses , thrombocytopenia , or anticoagulant use .
( 5 . 1 ) • Increased Exposure in Patients with Hepatic Impairment : Use a 250 mg dose for patients with moderate hepatic impairment .
( 2 . 2 , 5 . 2 , 8 . 6 ) • Injection Site Reaction : Use caution while administering fulvestrant injection at the dorsogluteal injection site due to the proximity of the underlying sciatic nerve .
( 5 . 3 ) • Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm .
Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception .
( 5 . 4 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) • Immunoassay Measurement of Serum Estradiol : Fulvestrant injection can interfere with estradiol measurement by immunoassay , resulting in falsely elevated estradiol levels .
( 5 . 5 ) 5 . 1 Risk of Bleeding Because fulvestrant is administered intramuscularly , it should be used with caution in patients with bleeding diatheses , thrombocytopenia , or anticoagulant use .
5 . 2 Increased Exposure in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The safety and pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant were evaluated in a study in seven subjects with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class B ) and seven subjects with normal hepatic function .
Exposure was increased in patients with moderate hepatic impairment , therefore , a dose of 250 mg is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Fulvestrant has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class C ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
5 . 3 Injection Site Reaction Injection site related events including sciatica , neuralgia , neuropathic pain , and peripheral neuropathy have been reported with fulvestrant injection .
Caution should be taken while administering fulvestrant at the dorsogluteal injection site due to the proximity of the underlying sciatic nerve [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) andAdverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 4 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action , fulvestrant can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of fulvestrant to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryo - fetal toxicity at daily doses that are significantly less than the maximum recommended human dose .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with fulvestrant and for one year after the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) , ( 8 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 5 Immunoassay Measurement of Serum Estradiol Due to structural similarity of fulvestrant and estradiol , fulvestrant can interfere with estradiol measurement by immunoassay , resulting in falsely elevated estradiol levels .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling : • Risk of Bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
• Increased Exposure in Patients with Hepatic Impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
• Injection Site Reaction [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
• Embryo - Fetal Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .

The data described below reflect exposure to fulvestrant plus ribociclib in 483 out of 724 postmenopausal patients with HR - positive , HER2 - negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer for initial endocrine based therapy or after disease progression on endocrine therapy who received at least one dose of fulvestrant plus ribociclib or placebo in MONALEESA - 3 .
Median duration of treatment was 15 . 8 months for fulvestrant plus ribociclib and 12 months for fulvestrant plus placebo .
Dose reductions due to adverse reactions occurred in 32 % of patients receiving fulvestrant plus ribociclib and in 3 % of patients receiving fulvestrant plus placebo .
Among patients receiving fulvestrant plus ribociclib , 8 % were reported to have permanently discontinued both fulvestrant plus ribociclib , and 9 % were reported to have discontinued ribociclib alone due to ARs .
Among patients receiving fulvestrant plus placebo , 4 % were reported to have permanently discontinued both fulvestrant and placebo and 2 % were reported to have discontinued placebo alone due to ARs .
Adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation of fulvestrant plus ribociclib ( as compared to fulvestrant plus placebo ) were ALT increased ( 5 % vs . 0 % ) , AST increased ( 3 % vs . 0 . 6 % ) , and vomiting ( 1 % vs . 0 % ) .
The most common adverse reactions ( reported at a frequency ≥ 20 % on the fulvestrant plus ribociclib arm and ≥ 2 % higher than fulvestrant plus placebo ) were neutropenia , infections , leukopenia , cough , nausea , diarrhea , vomiting , constipation , pruritus , and rash .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
For fulvestrant 250 mg , other adverse reactions reported as drug - related and seen infrequently ( < 1 % ) include thromboembolic phenomena , myalgia , vertigo , leukopenia , and hypersensitivity reactions , including angioedema and urticaria .
Vaginal bleeding has been reported infrequently ( < 1 % ) , mainly in patients during the first 6 weeks after changing from existing hormonal therapy to treatment with fulvestrant .
If bleeding persists , further evaluation should be considered .
Elevation of bilirubin , elevation of gamma GT , hepatitis , and liver failure have been reported infrequently ( < 1 % ) .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There are no known drug - drug interactions .
Although , fulvestrant is metabolized by CYP3A4 in vitro , drug interactions studies with ketoconazole or rifampin did not alter fulvestrant pharmacokinetics .
Dose adjustment is not needed in patients co - prescribed CYP 3A4 inhibitors or inducers [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
• There are no known drug - drug interactions .
( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action , fulvestrant can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug - associated risk .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of fulvestrant to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis caused embryo - fetal toxicity , including skeletal malformations and fetal loss , at daily doses that were 6 % and 30 % of the maximum recommended human dose based on mg / m2 , respectively [ see Data ] .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Administration of fulvestrant to rats prior to and up to implantation caused embryonic loss at daily doses that were 0 . 6 % of the daily maximum recommended human dose based on mg / m2 .
When fulvestrant was administered to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis , intramuscular doses ≥ 0 . 1 mg / kg / day ( 6 % of the human recommended dose based on mg / m2 ) caused effects on embryo - fetal development consistent with its antiestrogenic activity .
Fulvestrant caused an increased incidence of fetal abnormalities in rats ( tarsal flexure of the hind paw at 2 mg / kg / day ; equivalent to the human dose based on mg / m2 ) and non - ossification of the odontoid and ventral tubercle of the first cervical vertebra at doses ≥ 0 . 1 mg / kg / day .
Fulvestrant administered at 2 mg / kg / day caused fetal loss .
When administered to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis , fulvestrant caused pregnancy loss at an intramuscular dose of 1 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to the human dose based on mg / m2 ) .
Further , at 0 . 25 mg / kg / day ( 30 % the human dose based on mg / m2 ) , fulvestrant caused increases in placental weight and post - implantation loss in rabbits .
Fulvestrant was associated with an increased incidence of fetal variations in rabbits ( backwards displacement of the pelvic girdle , and 27 pre - sacral vertebrae at 0 . 25 mg / kg / day ; 30 % the human dose based on mg / m2 ) when administered during the period of organogenesis .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of fulvestrant in human milk , nor of its effects on milk production or breastfed infant .
Fulvestrant can be detected in rat milk [ see Data ] .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from fulvestrant , advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with fulvestrant and for one year after the final dose .
Data Levels of fulvestrant were approximately 12 - fold higher in milk than in plasma after exposure of lactating rats to a dose of 2 mg / kg .
Drug exposure in rodent pups from fulvestrant - treated lactating dams was estimated as 10 % of the administered dose .
In a study in rats of fulvestrant at 10 mg / kg given twice or 15 mg / kg given once ( less than the recommended human dose based on mg / m2 ) during lactation , offspring survival was slightly reduced .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential within seven days prior to initiating fulvestrant .
Contraception Females Fulvestrant can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for one year after the last dose .
Infertility Based on animal studies , fulvestrant may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential .
The effects of fulvestrant on fertility were reversible in female rats [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
A multi - center , single - arm , open - label , study of fulvestrant was conducted in 30 girls with McCune - Albright Syndrome ( MAS ) associated with Progressive Precocious Puberty ( PPP ) .
The median age at informed consent was 6 years old ( range : 1 to 8 ) .
The first 10 patients initially received fulvestrant 2 mg / kg .
Based on PK data from the first 6 patients , all 10 patients receiving 2 mg / kg were escalated to a dose of 4 mg / kg and all other patients received 4 mg / kg from study entry .
Baseline measurements for vaginal bleeding days , bone age , growth velocity , and Tanner staging for at least 6 months prior to study entry were provided retrospectively by the parent , guardian , or local consultant .
All measurements during the study period were collected prospectively .
Patients ’ baseline characteristics included the following : a mean ± SD chronological age of 5 . 9 ± 1 . 8 years ; a mean rate of bone age advancement ( change in bone age in years divided by change in chronological age in years ) of 2 . 0 ± 1 . 03 ; and a mean growth velocity z - score of 2 . 4 ± 3 . 26 .
Twenty - nine of 30 patients completed the 12 - month study period .
The following results were observed : 35 % ( 95 % CI : 16 % , 57 % ) of the 23 patients with baseline vaginal bleeding experienced a complete cessation of vaginal bleeding on - treatment ( month 0 to 12 ) ; a reduction in the rate of bone age advancement during the 12 - month study period compared to baseline ( mean change = - 0 . 9 [ 95 % CI : - 1 . 4 , - 0 . 4 ] ) ; and a reduction in mean growth velocity Z - score on - treatment compared to baseline ( mean change = - 1 . 1 [ 95 % CI : - 2 . 7 , 0 . 4 ] ) .
There were no clinically meaningful changes in median Tanner stage ( breast or pubic ) , mean uterine volume , or mean ovarian volume , or predicted adult height ( PAH ) on - treatment compared to baseline .
The effect of fulvestrant on bone mineral density in children has not been studied and is not known .
Eight patients ( 27 % ) experienced adverse reactions that were considered possibly related to fulvestrant .
These included injection site reactions ( inflammation , pain , hematoma , pruritus , rash ) , abdominal pain , contusion , tachycardia , hot flash , extremity pain , and vomiting .
Nine ( 30 % ) patients reported an SAE , none of which were considered related to fulvestrant .
No patients discontinued study treatment due to an AE and no patients died .
Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant was characterized using a population pharmacokinetic analysis with sparse samples per patient obtained from 30 female pediatric patients aged 1 to 8 years with PPP associated with MAS .
Pharmacokinetic data from 294 postmenopausal women with breast cancer who received 125 or 250 mg monthly dosing regimen were also included in the analysis .
In these pediatric patients receiving 4 mg / kg monthly intramuscular dose of fulvestrant , the geometric mean ( SD ) CL / F was 444 ( 165 ) mL / min which was 32 % lower than adults .
The geometric mean ( SD ) steady - state trough concentration ( Cmin , ss ) and AUCss was 4 . 19 ( 0 . 87 ) ng / mL and 3680 ( 1020 ) ng * hr / mL , respectively .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use For fulvestrant 250 mg , when tumor response was considered by age , objective responses were seen in 22 % and 24 % of patients under 65 years of age and in 11 % and 16 % of patients 65 years of age and older , who were treated with fulvestrant in Study 0021 and Study 0020 , respectively .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Fulvestrant is metabolized primarily in the liver .
The pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant were evaluated after a single dose of 100 mg in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function ( n = 7 subjects / group ) , using a shorter - acting intramuscular injection formulation .
Subjects with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class A ) had comparable mean AUC and clearance values to those with normal hepatic function .
In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class B ) , the average AUC of fulvestrant increased by 70 % compared to patients with normal hepatic function .
AUC was positively correlated with total bilirubin concentration ( p = 0 . 012 ) .
Fulvestrant has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class C ) .
A dose of fulvestrant 250 mg is recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class B ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) andWarnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment Negligible amounts of fulvestrant are eliminated in urine ; therefore , a study in patients with renal impairment was not conducted .
In the advanced breast cancer trials , fulvestrant concentrations in women with estimated creatinine clearance as low as 30 mL / min were similar to women with normal creatinine .
10 OVERDOSAGE Human experience of overdose with fulvestrant is limited .
There are isolated reports of overdose with fulvestrant in humans .
No adverse reactions were seen in healthy male and female volunteers who received intravenous fulvestrant , which resulted in peak plasma concentrations at the end of the infusion , that were approximately 10 to 15 times those seen after intramuscular injection .
The potential toxicity of fulvestrant at these or higher concentrations in cancer patients who may have additional comorbidities is unknown .
There is no specific treatment in the event of fulvestrant overdose , and symptoms of overdose are not established .
In the event of an overdose , healthcare practitioners should follow general supportive measures and should treat symptomatically .
11 DESCRIPTION Fulvestrant injection for intramuscular administration is an estrogen receptor antagonist .
The chemical name is 7 - alpha - [ 9 - ( 4 , 4 , 5 , 5 , 5 - penta fluoropentylsulphinyl ) nonyl ] estra - 1 , 3 , 5 - ( 10 ) - triene - 3 , 17 - beta - diol .

Each injection contains as inactive ingredients : 12 . 29 % v / v Alcohol , USP ; 10 % w / v Benzyl Alcohol , NF ; 15 % w / v Benzyl Benzoate , USP as co - solvents ; and made up to 100 % w / v with Castor Oil , USP as a co - solvent and release rate modifier .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Many breast cancers have estrogen receptors ( ER ) and the growth of these tumors can be stimulated by estrogen .
Fulvestrant is an estrogen receptor antagonist that binds to the estrogen receptor in a competitive manner with affinity comparable to that of estradiol and downregulates the ER protein in human breast cancer cells .
In vitro studies demonstrated that fulvestrant is a reversible inhibitor of the growth of tamoxifen - resistant , as well as estrogen - sensitive human breast cancer ( MCF - 7 ) cell lines .
In in vivo tumor studies , fulvestrant delayed the establishment of tumors from xenografts of human breast cancer MCF - 7 cells in nude mice .
Fulvestrant inhibited the growth of established MCF - 7 xenografts and of tamoxifen - resistant breast tumor xenografts .
Fulvestrant showed no agonist - type effects in in vivo uterotrophic assays in immature or ovariectomized mice and rats .
In in vivo studies in immature rats and ovariectomized monkeys , fulvestrant blocked the uterotrophic action of estradiol .
In postmenopausal women , the absence of changes in plasma concentrations of FSH and LH in response to fulvestrant treatment ( 250 mg monthly ) suggests no peripheral steroidal effects .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In a clinical study in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer treated with single doses of fulvestrant 15 to 22 days prior to surgery , there was evidence of increasing down - regulation of ER with increasing dose .
This was associated with a dose - related decrease in the expression of the progesterone receptor , an estrogen - regulated protein .
These effects on the ER pathway were also associated with a decrease in Ki67 labeling index , a marker of cell proliferation .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption : The single dose and multiple dose PK parameters for the 500 mg dosing regimen with an additional dose ( AD ) at Day 15 are reported in Table 11 .
The additional dose of fulvestrant given two weeks after the initial dose allows for steady - state concentrations to be reached within the first month of dosing .

Additional 500 mg dose given on Day 15 2 .
Month 3 Distribution : The apparent volume of distribution at steady - state is approximately 3 to 5 L / kg .
This suggests that distribution is largely extravascular .
Fulvestrant is highly ( 99 % ) bound to plasma proteins ; VLDL , LDL and HDL lipoprotein fractions appear to be the major binding components .
The role of sex hormone - binding globulin , if any , could not be determined .
Metabolism : Biotransformation and disposition of fulvestrant in humans have been determined following intramuscular and intravenous administration of 14 C - labeled fulvestrant .
Metabolism of fulvestrant appears to involve combinations of a number of possible biotransformation pathways analogous to those of endogenous steroids , including oxidation , aromatic hydroxylation , conjugation with glucuronic acid and / or sulphate at the 2 , 3 and 17 positions of the steroid nucleus , and oxidation of the side chain sulphoxide .
Identified metabolites are either less active or exhibit similar activity to fulvestrant in antiestrogen models .
Studies using human liver preparations and recombinant human enzymes indicate that cytochrome P - 450 3A4 ( CYP 3A4 ) is the only P - 450 isoenzyme involved in the oxidation of fulvestrant ; however , the relative contribution of P - 450 and non - P - 450 routes in vivo is unknown .
Excretion : Fulvestrant was rapidly cleared by the hepatobiliary route with excretion primarily via the feces ( approximately 90 % ) .
Renal elimination was negligible ( less than 1 % ) .
After an intramuscular injection of 250 mg , the clearance ( Mean ± SD ) was 690 ± 226 mL / min with an apparent half - life about 40 days .
Special Populations : Geriatric : In patients with breast cancer , there was no difference in fulvestrant pharmacokinetic profile related to age ( range 33 to 89 years ) .
Gender : Following administration of a single intravenous dose , there were no pharmacokinetic differences between men and women or between premenopausal and postmenopausal women .
Similarly , there were no differences between men and postmenopausal women after intramuscular administration .
Race : In the advanced breast cancer treatment trials , the potential for pharmacokinetic differences due to race have been evaluated in 294 women including 87 . 4 % Caucasian , 7 . 8 % Black , and 4 . 4 % Hispanic .
No differences in fulvestrant plasma pharmacokinetics were observed among these groups .
In a separate trial , pharmacokinetic data from postmenopausal ethnic Japanese women were similar to those obtained in non - Japanese patients .
Drug - Drug Interactions : There are no known drug - drug interactions .
Fulvestrant does not significantly inhibit any of the major CYP isoenzymes , including CYP 1A2 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , and 3A4 in vitro , and studies of co - administration of fulvestrant with midazolam indicate that therapeutic doses of fulvestrant have no inhibitory effects on CYP 3A4 or alter blood levels of drug metabolized by that enzyme .
Although fulvestrant is partly metabolized by CYP 3A4 , a clinical study with rifampin , an inducer of CYP 3A4 , showed no effect on the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant .
Also , results from a healthy volunteer study with ketoconazole , a potent inhibitor of CYP 3A4 , indicated that ketoconazole had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of fulvestrant and dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients co - prescribed CYP 3A4 inhibitors or inducers [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Data from a clinical trial in patients with breast cancer showed that there was no clinically relevant drug interaction when fulvestrant is co - administered with palbociclib , abemaciclib , or ribociclib .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Two - year carcinogenesis studies were conducted in rats and mice .
Positive findings were observed in both species .
Rats were treated at intramuscular doses of 15 mg / kg / 30 days , 10 mg / rat / 30 days and 10 mg / rat / 15 days .
These doses correspond to 0 . 9 - , 1 . 5 - , and 3 - fold ( in females ) and 0 . 8 - , 0 . 8 - , and 2 - fold ( in males ) the systemic exposure [ AUC0 - 30 days ] achieved in women receiving the recommended dose of 500 mg / month .
An increased incidence of benign ovarian granulosa cell tumors and testicular Leydig cell tumors was evident , in females dosed at 10 mg / rat / 15 days and males dosed at 15 mg / rat / 30 days , respectively .
Mice were treated at oral doses of 0 , 20 , 150 and 500 mg / kg / day .
These doses correspond to 0 - , 0 . 8 - , 8 . 4 - and 18 - fold ( in females ) and 0 . 8 - , 7 . 1 - and 11 . 9 - fold ( in males ) , the systemic exposure ( AUC0 - 30 days ) achieved in women receiving the recommended dose of 500 mg / month .
There was an increased incidence of sex cord stromal tumors ( both benign and malignant ) in the ovary of mice at doses of 150 and 500 mg / kg / day .
Induction of such tumors is consistent with the pharmacology - related endocrine feedback alterations in gonadotropin levels caused by an antiestrogen .
Fulvestrant was not mutagenic or clastogenic in multiple in vitro tests with and without the addition of a mammalian liver metabolic activation factor ( bacterial mutation assay in strains of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , in vitro cytogenetics study in human lymphocytes , mammalian cell mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and in vivo micronucleus test in rat ) .
In female rats , fulvestrant administered at doses ≥ 0 . 01 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 6 % the human recommended dose based on body surface area [ BSA in mg / m2 ] ) , for 2 weeks prior to and for 1 week following mating , caused a reduction in fertility and embryonic survival .
No adverse effects on female fertility and embryonic survival were evident in female animals dosed at 0 . 001 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 06 % the human dose based on BSA in mg / m2 ) .
Restoration of female fertility to values similar to controls was evident following a 29 - day withdrawal period after dosing at 2 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to the human dose based on BSA in mg / m2 ) .
The effects of fulvestrant on the fertility of female rats appear to be consistent with its antiestrogenic activity .
The potential effects of fulvestrant on the fertility of male animals were not studied , but in a 6 - month toxicology study , male rats treated with intramuscular doses of 15 mg / kg / 30 days , 10 mg / rat / 30 days , or 10 mg / rat / 15 days fulvestrant showed a loss of spermatozoa from the seminiferous tubules , seminiferous tubular atrophy , and degenerative changes in the epididymides .
Changes in the testes and epididymides had not recovered 20 weeks after cessation of dosing .
These fulvestrant doses correspond to 1 . 3 - , 1 . 2 - and 3 . 5 - fold the systemic exposure [ AUC0 - 30 days ] achieved in women receiving the recommended dose of 500 mg / month .

This trial compared the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant 500 mg ( n = 362 ) with fulvestrant 250 mg ( n = 374 ) .
Fulvestrant 500 mg was administered as two 5 mL injections each containing fulvestrant 250 mg / 5 mL , one in each buttock , on Days 1 , 15 , 29 , and every 28 ( + / - 3 ) days thereafter .
Fulvestrant 250 mg was administered as two 5 mL injections ( one containing fulvestrant 250 mg / 5 mL injection plus one placebo injection ) , one in each buttock , on Days 1 , 15 ( 2 placebo injections only ) , 29 and every 28 ( + / - 3 ) days thereafter .
The median age of study participants was 61 years .
All patients had ER + advanced breast cancer .
Approximately 30 % of subjects had no measurable disease .
Approximately 55 % of patients had visceral disease .

A total of 462 patients were randomized 1 : 1 to receive administration of fulvestrant 500 mg as an intramuscular injection on Days 1 , 15 , 29 and every 28 ( + / - 3 ) days thereafter or daily administration of 1 mg of anastrozole orally .
This study compared the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant 500 mg and anastrozole 1 mg .
Randomization was stratified by disease setting ( locally advanced or metastatic ) , use of prior chemotherapy for advanced disease , and presence or absence of measurable disease .
The major efficacy outcome measure of the study was investigator - assessed progression - free survival ( PFS ) evaluated according to RECIST v . 1 . 1 ( Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ) .
Key secondary efficacy outcome measures included overall survival ( OS ) , objective response rate ( ORR ) , and duration of response ( DoR ) .
Patients enrolled in this study had a median age of 63 years ( range 36 to 90 ) .
The majority of patients ( 87 % ) had metastatic disease at baseline .
Fifty - five percent ( 55 % ) of patients had visceral metastasis at baseline .
A total of 17 % of patients had received one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease ; 84 % of patients had measurable disease .
Sites of metastases were as follows : musculoskeletal 59 % , lymph nodes 50 % , respiratory 40 % , liver ( including gall bladder ) 18 % .

All patients had progressed after previous therapy with an antiestrogen or progestin for breast cancer in the adjuvant or advanced disease setting .
The median age of study participants was 64 years .
81 . 6 % of patients had ER + and / or PgR + tumors .
Patients with ER - / PgR - or unknown tumors were required to have demonstrated a prior response to endocrine therapy .
Sites of metastases occurred as follows : visceral only 18 . 2 % ; viscera – liver involvement 23 . 0 % ; lung involvement 28 . 1 % ; bone only 19 . 7 % ; soft tissue only 5 . 2 % ; skin and soft tissue 18 . 7 % .
In both trials , eligible patients with measurable and / or evaluable disease were randomized to receive either fulvestrant 250 mg intramuscularly once a month ( 28 days ± 3 days ) or anastrozole 1 mg orally once a day .
All patients were assessed monthly for the first three months and every three months thereafter .
Study 0021 was a double - blind , randomized trial in 400 postmenopausal women .
Study 0020 was an open - label , randomized trial conducted in 451 postmenopausal women .
Patients on the fulvestrant arm of Study 0021 received two separate injections ( 2 x 2 . 5 mL ) , whereas fulvestrant patients received a single injection ( 1 x 5 mL ) in Study 0020 .
In both trials , patients were initially randomized to a 125 mg per month dose as well , but interim analysis showed a very low response rate , and low dose groups were dropped .
Results of the trials , after a minimum follow - up duration of 14 . 6 months , are summarized in Table 14 .
The effectiveness of fulvestrant 250 mg was determined by comparing Objective Response Rate ( ORR ) and Time to Progression ( TTP ) results to anastrozole 1 mg , the active control .
The two studies ruled out ( by one - sided 97 . 7 % confidence limit ) inferiority of fulvestrant to anastrozole of 6 . 3 % and 1 . 4 % in terms of ORR .
There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival ( OS ) between the two treatment groups after a follow - up duration of 28 . 2 months in Study 0021 and 24 . 4 months in Study 0020 .

Palbociclib was given orally at a dose of 125 mg daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment .
Fulvestrant 500 mg was administered as two 5 mL injections each containing fulvestrant 250 mg / 5 mL , one in each buttock , on Days 1 , 15 , 29 and every 28 ( + / - 3 ) days thereafter .
Pre / perimenopausal women were enrolled in the study and received the LHRH agonist goserelin for at least 4 weeks prior to and for the duration of PALOMA - 3 .
Patients continued to receive assigned treatment until objective disease progression , symptomatic deterioration , unacceptable toxicity , death , or withdrawal of consent , whichever occurred first .
The major efficacy outcome of the study was investigator - assessed PFS evaluated according to RECIST v . 1 . 1 .
Patients enrolled in this study had a median age of 57 years ( range 29 to 88 ) .
The majority of patients on study were White ( 74 % ) , all patients had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 , and 80 % were postmenopausal .
All patients had received prior systemic therapy and 75 % of patients had received a previous chemotherapy regimen .
Twenty - five percent of patients had received no prior therapy in the metastatic disease setting , 60 % had visceral metastases , and 23 % had bone only disease .
The results from the investigator - assessed PFS and final OS data from PALOMA - 3 are summarized in Table 15 .
The relevant Kaplan - Meier plots are shown in Figures 9 and 10 , respectively .
Consistent PFS results were observed across patient subgroups of disease site , sensitivity to prior hormonal therapy , and menopausal status .
