( 5 . 11 ) 5 . 1 Peripheral Neuropathy Bortezomib treatment causes a peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly sensory ; however , cases of severe sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy have been reported .
Patients with pre - existing symptoms ( numbness , pain or a burning feeling in the feet or hands ) and / or signs of peripheral neuropathy may experience worsening peripheral neuropathy ( including ≥ Grade 3 ) during treatment with bortezomib .
[ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] Patients should be monitored for symptoms of neuropathy , such as a burning sensation , hyperesthesia , hypoesthesia , paresthesia , discomfort , neuropathic pain or weakness .
Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy during Bortezomib for Injection therapy may require a decrease in the dose and / or a less dose - intense schedule [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
In the bortezomib versus dexamethasone phase 3 relapsed multiple myeloma study , improvement in or resolution of peripheral neuropathy was reported in 48 % of patients with ≥ Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy following dose adjustment or interruption .
Improvement in or resolution of peripheral neuropathy was reported in 73 % of patients who discontinued due to Grade 2 neuropathy or who had ≥ Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy in the phase 2 multiple myeloma studies .
The long - term outcome of peripheral neuropathy has not been studied in mantle cell lymphoma .
5 . 2 Hypotension The incidence of hypotension ( postural , orthostatic , and hypotension NOS ) was 8 % [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
These events are observed throughout therapy .
Patients with a history of syncope , patients receiving medications known to be associated with hypotension , and patients who are dehydrated may be at increased risk of hypotension .
Management of orthostatic / postural hypotension may include adjustment of antihypertensive medications , hydration , and administration of mineralocorticoids and / or sympathomimetics .
5 . 3 Cardiac Toxicity Acute development or exacerbation of congestive heart failure and new onset of decreased left ventricular ejection fraction have occurred during bortezomib therapy , including reports in patients with no risk factors for decreased left ventricular ejection fraction [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Patients with risk factors for , or existing heart disease should be frequently monitored .
In the relapsed multiple myeloma study of bortezomib versus dexamethasone , the incidence of any treatment - related cardiac disorder was 8 % and 5 % in the bortezomib and dexamethasone groups , respectively .
The incidence of adverse reactions suggestive of heart failure ( acute pulmonary edema , pulmonary edema , cardiac failure , congestive cardiac failure , cardiogenic shock ) was ≤ 1 % for each individual reaction in the bortezomib group .
In the dexamethasone group the incidence was ≤ 1 % for cardiac failure and congestive cardiac failure ; there were no reported reactions of acute pulmonary edema , pulmonary edema , or cardiogenic shock .
There have been isolated cases of QT - interval prolongation in clinical studies ; causality has not been established .
5 . 4 Pulmonary Toxicity Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) and acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease of unknown etiology such as pneumonitis , interstitial pneumonia , lung infiltration have occurred in patients receiving bortezomib .
Some of these events have been fatal .
In a clinical trial , the first two patients given high - dose cytarabine ( 2 g / m2 per day ) by continuous infusion with daunorubicin and bortezomib for relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia died of ARDS early in the course of therapy .
There have been reports of pulmonary hypertension associated with bortezomib administration in the absence of left heart failure or significant pulmonary disease .

5 . 5 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome ( PRES ) Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome ( PRES ; formerly termed Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome ( RPLS ) ) has occurred in patients receiving bortezomib .
PRES is a rare , reversible , neurological disorder which can present with seizure , hypertension , headache , lethargy , confusion , blindness , and other visual and neurological disturbances .
Brain imaging , preferably MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) , is used to confirm the diagnosis .
In patients developing PRES , discontinue Bortezomib for Injection .
The safety of reinitiating Bortezomib for Injection therapy in patients previously experiencing PRES is not known .
5 . 6 Gastrointestinal Toxicity Bortezomib treatment can cause nausea , diarrhea , constipation , and vomiting [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] sometimes requiring use of antiemetic and antidiarrheal medications .
Ileus can occur .
Fluid and electrolyte replacement should be administered to prevent dehydration .
Interrupt Bortezomib for Injection for severe symptoms .
5 . 7 Thrombocytopenia / Neutropenia Bortezomib is associated with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia that follow a cyclical pattern with nadirs occurring following the last dose of each cycle and typically recovering prior to initiation of the subsequent cycle .
The cyclical pattern of platelet and neutrophil decreases and recovery remain consistent in the studies of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma , with no evidence of cumulative thrombocytopenia or neutropenia in the treatment regimens studied .
Monitor complete blood counts ( CBC ) frequently during treatment with Bortezomib for Injection .
Measure platelet counts prior to each dose of Bortezomib for Injection .
Adjust dose / schedule for thrombocytopenia [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Gastrointestinal and intracerebral hemorrhage has occurred during thrombocytopenia in association with bortezomib .
Support with transfusions and supportive care , according to published guidelines .
In the single - agent , relapsed multiple myeloma study of bortezomib versus dexamethasone , the mean platelet count nadir measured was approximately 40 % of baseline .
The severity of thrombocytopenia related to pretreatment platelet count is shown in Table 7 .
The incidence of bleeding ( ≥ Grade 3 ) was 2 % on the bortezomib arm and was < 1 % in the dexamethasone arm .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure : Cardiac disorders : Cardiac tamponade Ear and labyrinth disorders : Deafness bilateral Eye disorders : Optic neuropathy , blindness , chalazion / blepharitis Gastrointestinal disorders : Ischemic colitis Infections and infestations : Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) , ophthalmic herpes , herpes meningoencephalitis Nervous system disorders : Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( PRES , formerly RPLS ) Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders : Acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Stevens - Johnson syndrome / toxic epidermal necrolysis ( SJS / TEN ) , acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis ( Sweet ' s syndrome ) 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors : Closely monitor patients with concomitant use .
( 7 . 1 ) • Strong CYP3A4 Inducers : Avoid concomitant use .
( 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Effects of Other Drugs on Bortezomib Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration with a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreases the exposure of bortezomib [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] which may decrease bortezomib efficacy .
Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A4 inducers .
Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases the exposure of bortezomib [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] which may increase the risk of bortezomib toxicities .
Monitor patients for signs of bortezomib toxicity and consider a bortezomib dose reduction if bortezomib must be given in combination with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors .
7 . 2 Drugs Without Clinically Significant Interactions with Bortezomib No clinically significant drug interactions have been observed when bortezomib was coadministered with dexamethasone , omeprazole , or melphalan in combination with prednisone [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Patients with diabetes may require close monitoring of blood glucose and adjustment of anti - diabetic medication .
( 8 . 8 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] and findings in animals , Bortezomib for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no studies with the use of bortezomib in pregnant women to inform drug - associated risks .
Bortezomib caused embryo - fetal lethality in rabbits at doses lower than the clinical dose [ see Data ] .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus .
Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Bortezomib was not teratogenic in nonclinical developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits at the highest dose tested ( 0 . 075 mg / kg ; 0 . 5 mg / m2 in the rat and 0 . 05 mg / kg ; 0 . 6 mg / m2 in the rabbit ) when administered during organogenesis .
These dosages are approximately 0 . 5 times the clinical dose of 1 . 3 mg / m2 based on body surface area .
Bortezomib caused embryo - fetal lethality in rabbits at doses lower than the clinical dose ( approximately 0 . 5 times the clinical dose of 1 . 3 mg / m2 based on body surface area ) .
Pregnant rabbits given bortezomib during organogenesis at a dose of 0 . 05 mg / kg ( 0 . 6 mg / m2 ) experienced significant post - implantation loss and decreased number of live fetuses .
Live fetuses from these litters also showed significant decreases in fetal weight .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of bortezomib or its metabolites in human milk , the effects of the drug on the breastfed child , or the effects of the drug on milk production .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from Bortezomib for Injection is unknown , advise nursing women not to breastfeed during treatment with Bortezomib for Injection and for 2 months after treatment .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals , Bortezomib for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Bortezomib for Injection treatment .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Bortezomib for Injection and for 7 months after the last dose .
Males Males with female partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment with Bortezomib for Injection and for 4 months after the last dose .
Infertility Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals , Bortezomib for Injection may have an effect on either male or female fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients .
The activity and safety of bortezomib in combination with intensive reinduction chemotherapy was evaluated in pediatric and young adult patients with lymphoid malignancies ( pre - B cell ALL 77 % , 16 % with T - cell ALL , and 7 % T - cell lymphoblastic lymphoma ( LL ) ) , all of whom relapsed within 36 months of initial diagnosis in a single - arm multicenter , non - randomized cooperative group trial .
An effective reinduction multiagent chemotherapy regimen was administered in three blocks .
Block 1 included vincristine , prednisone , doxorubicin and pegaspargase ; Block 2 included cyclophosphamide , etoposide and methotrexate ; Block 3 included high dose cytosine arabinoside and asparaginase .
Bortezomib was administered at a dose of 1 . 3 mg / m2 as a bolus intravenous injection on Days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 of Block 1 and Days 1 , 4 , and 8 of Block 2 .
There were 140 patients with ALL or LL enrolled and evaluated for safety .
The median age was ten years ( range 1 to 26 ) , 57 % were male , 70 % were white , 14 % were black , 4 % were Asian , 2 % were American Indian / Alaska Native , 1 % were Pacific Islander .
The activity was evaluated in a pre - specified subset of the first 60 evaluable patients enrolled on the study with pre - B ALL ≤ 21 years and relapsed < 36 months from diagnosis .
The complete remission ( CR ) rate at day 36 was compared to that in a historical control set of patients who had received the identical backbone therapy without bortezomib .
There was no evidence that the addition of bortezomib had any impact on the CR rate .
No new safety concerns were observed when bortezomib was added to a chemotherapy backbone regimen as compared with a historical control group in which the backbone regimen was given without bortezomib .
The BSA - normalized clearance of bortezomib in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 669 patients enrolled in the relapsed multiple myeloma study , 245 ( 37 % ) were 65 years of age or older : 125 ( 38 % ) on the bortezomib arm and 120 ( 36 % ) on the dexamethasone arm .
Median time to progression and median duration of response for patients ≥ 65 were longer on bortezomib compared to dexamethasone [ 5 . 5 mo versus 4 . 3 mo , and 8 . 0 mo versus 4 . 9 mo , respectively ] .
On the bortezomib arm , 40 % ( n = 46 ) of evaluable patients aged ≥ 65 experienced response ( CR + PR ) versus 18 % ( n = 21 ) on the dexamethasone arm .
The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 events was 64 % , 78 % and 75 % for bortezomib patients ≤ 50 , 51 to 64 and ≥ 65 years old , respectively [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ; Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients ≥ age 65 and younger patients receiving bortezomib ; but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No starting dosage adjustment of Bortezomib for Injection is recommended for patients with renal impairment .
In patients requiring dialysis , Bortezomib for Injection should be administered after the dialysis procedure [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No starting dosage adjustment of Bortezomib for Injection is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin ≤ 1 x ULN and AST > ULN , or total bilirubin > 1 to 1 . 5 x ULN and any AST ) .
The exposure of bortezomib is increased in patients with moderate ( total bilirubin ≥ 1 . 5 to 3 x ULN and any AST ) and severe ( total bilirubin > 3 x ULN and any AST ) hepatic impairment .
Reduce the starting dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 8 Patients with Diabetes During clinical trials , hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia were reported in diabetic patients receiving oral hypoglycemics .
Patients on oral antidiabetic agents receiving Bortezomib for Injection treatment may require close monitoring of their blood glucose levels and adjustment of the dose of their antidiabetic medication .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known specific antidote for bortezomib overdosage .
In humans , fatal outcomes following the administration of more than twice the recommended therapeutic dose have been reported , which were associated with the acute onset of symptomatic hypotension ( 5 . 2 ) and thrombocytopenia ( 5 . 7 ) .
In the event of an overdosage , the patient ' s vital signs should be monitored and appropriate supportive care given .
Studies in monkeys and dogs showed that intravenous bortezomib doses as low as 2 times the recommended clinical dose on a mg / m2 basis were associated with increases in heart rate , decreases in contractility , hypotension , and death .
In dog studies , a slight increase in the corrected QT interval was observed at doses resulting in death .
In monkeys , doses of 3 mg / m2 and greater ( approximately twice the recommended clinical dose ) resulted in hypotension starting at 1 hour post - administration , with progression to death in 12 to 14 hours following drug administration .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Bortezomib is a reversible inhibitor of the chymotrypsin - like activity of the 26 S proteasome in mammalian cells .
The 26 S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins .
The ubiquitin proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins , thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells .
Inhibition of the 26 S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis , which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell .
This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death .
Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types in vitro .
Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth in vivo in nonclinical tumor models , including multiple myeloma .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Following twice weekly administration of 1 mg / m2 and 1 . 3 mg / m2 bortezomib doses , the maximum inhibition of 20 S proteasome activity ( relative to baseline ) in whole blood was observed 5 minutes after drug administration .
Comparable maximum inhibition of 20 S proteasome activity was observed between 1 and 1 . 3 mg / m2 doses .
Maximal inhibition ranged from 70 % to 84 % and from 73 % to 83 % for the 1 mg / m2 and 1 . 3 mg / m2 dose regimens , respectively .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous administration of 1 mg / m2 and 1 . 3 mg / m2 doses , the mean maximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib ( Cmax ) after the first dose ( Day 1 ) were 57 and 112 ng / mL , respectively .
When administered twice weekly , the mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng / mL for the 1 mg / m2 dose and 89 to 120 ng / mL for the 1 . 3 mg / m2 dose .
Distribution : The mean distribution volume of bortezomib ranged from approximately 498 to 1 , 884 L / m2 following single - or repeat - dose administration of 1 mg / m2 or 1 . 3 mg / m2 to patients with multiple myeloma .
The binding of bortezomib to human plasma proteins averaged 83 % over the concentration range of 100 to 1 , 000 ng / mL .
Elimination : The mean elimination half - life of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40 to 193 hours after the 1 mg / m2 dose and 76 to 108 hours after the 1 . 3 mg / m2 dose .
The mean total body clearances were 102 and 112 L / h following the first dose for doses of 1 mg / m2 and 1 . 3 mg / m2 , respectively , and ranged from 15 to 32 L / h following subsequent doses for doses of 1 and 1 . 3 mg / m2 , respectively .
Metabolism : Bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolized to several inactive metabolites in vitro via cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes 3A4 , CYP2C19 , and CYP1A2 , and to a lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 .
Excretion : The pathways of elimination of bortezomib have not been characterized in humans .
Specific Populations : No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of bortezomib were observed based on age , sex , or renal impairment ( including patients administered Bortezomib for Injection after dialysis ) .
The effect of race on bortezomib pharmacokinetics is unknown .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment : Following administration of bortezomib doses ranging from 0 . 5 to 1 . 3 mg / m2 , mild ( total bilirubin ≤ 1 x ULN and AST > ULN , or total bilirubin > 1 to 1 . 5 x ULN and any AST ) hepatic impairment did not alter dose - normalized bortezomib AUC when compared to patients with normal hepatic function .
Dose normalized mean bortezomib AUC increased by approximately 60 % in patients with moderate ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 to 3 x ULN and any AST ) or severe ( total bilirubin > 3 x ULN and any AST ) hepatic impairment .
A lower starting dose is recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment .
Drug Interaction Studies : Clinical Studies No clinically significant differences in bortezomib pharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered with dexamethasone ( weak CYP3A4 inducer ) , omeprazole ( strong CYP2C19 inhibitor ) , or melphalan in combination with prednisone .
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitor Coadministration with ketoconazole ( strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ) increased bortezomib exposure by 35 % .
Strong CYP3A4 inducer Coadministration with rifampin ( strong CYP3A4 inducer ) decreased bortezomib exposure by approximately 45 % .
In Vitro Studies Bortezomib may inhibit CYP2C19 activity and increase exposure to drugs that are substrates for this enzyme .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with bortezomib .
Bortezomib showed clastogenic activity ( structural chromosomal aberrations ) in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay using Chinese hamster ovary cells .
Bortezomib was not genotoxic when tested in the in vitro mutagenicity assay ( Ames test ) and in vivo micronucleus assay in mice .
Fertility studies with bortezomib were not performed but evaluation of reproductive tissues has been performed in the general toxicity studies .
In the 6 - month rat toxicity study , degenerative effects in the ovary were observed at doses ≥ 0 . 3 mg / m2 ( one - fourth of the recommended clinical dose ) , and degenerative changes in the testes occurred at 1 . 2 mg / m2 .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Cardiovascular Toxicity : Studies in monkeys showed that administration of dosages approximately twice the recommended clinical dose resulted in heart rate elevations , followed by profound progressive hypotension , bradycardia , and death 12 to 14 hours post dose .
Doses ≥ 1 . 2 mg / m2 induced dose - proportional changes in cardiac parameters .
Bortezomib has been shown to distribute to most tissues in the body , including the myocardium .
In a repeated dosing toxicity study in the monkey , myocardial hemorrhage , inflammation , and necrosis were also observed .
Chronic Administration : In animal studies at a dose and schedule similar to that recommended for patients ( twice weekly dosing for 2 weeks followed by 1 - week rest ) , toxicities observed included severe anemia and thrombocytopenia , and gastrointestinal , neurological and lymphoid system toxicities .
Neurotoxic effects of bortezomib in animal studies included axonal swelling and degeneration in peripheral nerves , dorsal spinal roots , and tracts of the spinal cord .
Additionally , multifocal hemorrhage and necrosis in the brain , eye , and heart were observed .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Multiple Myeloma Randomized , Open - Label Clinical Study in Patients with Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma : A prospective , international , randomized ( 1 : 1 ) , open - label clinical study ( NCT00111319 ) of 682 patients was conducted to determine whether bortezomib administered intravenously ( 1 . 3 mg / m2 ) in combination with melphalan ( 9 mg / m2 ) and prednisone ( 60 mg / m2 ) resulted in improvement in time to progression ( TTP ) when compared to melphalan ( 9 mg / m2 ) and prednisone ( 60 mg / m2 ) in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma .
Treatment was administered for a maximum of 9 cycles ( approximately 54 weeks ) and was discontinued early for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Antiviral prophylaxis was recommended for patients on the bortezomib study arm .
The median age of the patients in the study was 71 years ( 48 ; 91 ) , 50 % were male , 88 % were Caucasian and the median Karnofsky performance status score for the patients was 80 ( 60 ; 100 ) .
Patients had IgG / IgA / Light chain myeloma in 63 % / 25 % / 8 % instances , a median hemoglobin of 105 g / L ( 64 ; 165 ) , and a median platelet count of 221 , 500 / microliter ( 33 , 000 ; 587 , 000 ) .
Efficacy results for the trial are presented in Table 11 .
At a pre - specified interim analysis ( with median follow - up of 16 . 3 months ) , the combination of bortezomib , melphalan and prednisone therapy resulted in significantly superior results for time to progression , progression - free survival , overall survival and response rate .
Further enrollment was halted , and patients receiving melphalan and prednisone were offered bortezomib in addition .
A later , pre - specified analysis of overall survival ( with median follow - up of 36 . 7 months with a hazard ratio of 0 . 65 , 95 % CI : 0 . 51 , 0 . 84 ) resulted in a statistically significant survival benefit for the bortezomib , melphalan and prednisone treatment arm despite subsequent therapies including bortezomib based regimens .
In an updated analysis of overall survival based on 387 deaths ( median follow - up 60 . 1 months ) , the median overall survival for the bortezomib , melphalan and prednisone treatment arm was 56 . 4 months and for the melphalan and prednisone treatment arm was 43 . 1 months , with a hazard ratio of 0 . 695 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 57 , 0 . 85 ) .
Table 11 : Summary of Efficacy Analyses in the Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma Study Note : All results are based on the analysis performed at a median follow - up duration of 16 . 3 months except for the overall survival analysis .

( median follow - up 60 . 1 months ) Figure 2 : Overall Survival Bortezomib , Melphalan and Prednisone versus Melphalan and Prednisone [ MULTIMEDIA ] Randomized , Clinical Study in Relapsed Multiple Myeloma of Bortezomib versus Dexamethasone A prospective phase 3 , international , randomized ( 1 : 1 ) , stratified , open - label clinical study ( NCT00048230 ) enrolling 669 patients was designed to determine whether bortezomib resulted in improvement in time to progression ( TTP ) compared to high - dose dexamethasone in patients with progressive multiple myeloma following 1 to 3 prior therapies .
Patients considered to be refractory to prior high - dose dexamethasone were excluded as were those with baseline Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy or platelet counts < 50 , 000 / μL .
A total of 627 patients were evaluable for response .
Stratification factors were based on the number of lines of prior therapy the patient had previously received ( 1 previous line versus more than 1 line of therapy ) , time of progression relative to prior treatment ( progression during or within 6 months of stopping their most recent therapy versus relapse > 6 months after receiving their most recent therapy ) , and screening β2 - microglobulin levels ( ≤ 2 . 5 mg / L versus > 2 . 5 mg / L ) .

Patients achieving a CR were treated for 4 cycles beyond first evidence of CR .
Within each 3 - week treatment cycle , bortezomib 1 . 3 mg / m2 / dose alone was administered by intravenous bolus twice weekly for 2 weeks on Days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 followed by a 10 - day rest period ( Days 12 to 21 ) .
Within each 5 - week treatment cycle , bortezomib 1 . 3 mg / m2 / dose alone was administered by intravenous bolus once weekly for 4 weeks on Days 1 , 8 , 15 , and 22 followed by a 13 - day rest period ( Days 23 to 35 ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Patients in the dexamethasone treatment group were to receive four 5 - week treatment cycles followed by five 4 - week treatment cycles .
Within each 5 week treatment cycle , dexamethasone 40 mg / day PO was administered once daily on Days 1 to 4 , 9 to 12 , and 17 to 20 followed by a 15 - day rest period ( Days 21 to 35 ) .
Within each 4 - week treatment cycle , dexamethasone 40 mg / day PO was administered once daily on Days 1 to 4 followed by a 24 - day rest period ( Days 5 to 28 ) .
Patients with documented progressive disease on dexamethasone were offered bortezomib at a standard dose and schedule on a companion study .
Following a preplanned interim analysis of time to progression , the dexamethasone arm was halted and all patients randomized to dexamethasone were offered bortezomib , regardless of disease status .
In the bortezomib arm , 34 % of patients received at least one bortezomib dose in all 8 of the 3 - week cycles of therapy , and 13 % received at least one dose in all 11 cycles .
The average number of bortezomib doses during the study was 22 , with a range of 1 to 44 .
In the dexamethasone arm , 40 % of patients received at least one dose in all 4 of the 5 - week treatment cycles of therapy , and 6 % received at least one dose in all 9 cycles .
The time to event analyses and response rates from the relapsed multiple myeloma study are presented in Table 13 .
Response and progression were assessed using the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation ( EBMT ) criteria .
Complete response ( CR ) required < 5 % plasma cells in the marrow , 100 % reduction in M - protein , and a negative immunofixation test ( IF - ) .
Partial response ( PR ) requires ≥ 50 % reduction in serum myeloma protein and ≥ 90 % reduction of urine myeloma protein on at least 2 occasions for a minimum of at least 6 weeks along with stable bone disease and normal calcium .
Near complete response ( nCR ) was defined as meeting all the criteria for complete response including 100 % reduction in M - protein by protein electrophoresis ; however , M - protein was still detectable by immunofixation ( IF + ) .

The median follow - up was 8 . 3 months .
Figure 4 : Overall Survival Bortezomib versus Dexamethasone ( relapsed multiple myeloma study ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] For the 121 patients achieving a response ( CR or PR ) on the bortezomib arm , the median duration was 8 . 0 months ( 95 % CI : 6 . 9 , 11 . 5 months ) compared to 5 . 6 months ( 95 % CI : 4 . 8 , 9 . 2 months ) for the 56 responders on the dexamethasone arm .
The response rate was significantly higher on the bortezomib arm regardless of β2 - microglobulin levels at baseline .
A Randomized Phase 2 Dose - Response Study in Relapsed Multiple Myeloma An open - label , multicenter study randomized 54 patients with multiple myeloma who had progressed or relapsed on or after front - line therapy to receive bortezomib 1 mg / m2 or 1 . 3 mg / m2 intravenous bolus twice weekly for 2 weeks on Days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 followed by a 10 - day rest period ( Days 12 to 21 ) .
The median duration of time between diagnosis of multiple myeloma and first dose of bortezomib on this trial was 2 years , and patients had received a median of 1 prior line of treatment ( median of 3 prior therapies ) .
A single complete response was seen at each dose .
The overall response rates ( CR + PR ) were 30 % ( 8 / 27 ) at 1 mg / m2 and 38 % ( 10 / 26 ) at 1 . 3 mg / m2 .
A Phase 2 Open - Label Extension Study in Relapsed Multiple Myeloma Patients from the two phase 2 studies , who in the investigators ' opinion would experience additional clinical benefit , continued to receive bortezomib beyond 8 cycles on an extension study .
Sixty - three ( 63 ) patients from the phase 2 multiple myeloma studies were enrolled and received a median of 7 additional cycles of bortezomib therapy for a total median of 14 cycles ( range 7 to 32 ) .
The overall median dosing intensity was the same in both the parent protocol and extension study .
Sixty - seven percent ( 67 % ) of patients initiated the extension study at the same or higher dose intensity at which they completed the parent protocol , and 89 % of patients maintained the standard 3 - week dosing schedule during the extension study .
No new cumulative or new long - term toxicities were observed with prolonged bortezomib treatment [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
A Single - Arm Trial of Retreatment in Relapsed Multiple Myeloma A single arm , open - label trial ( NCT00431769 ) was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of retreatment with bortezomib .
One hundred and thirty patients ( ≥ 18 years of age ) with multiple myeloma who previously had at least partial response on a bortezomib - containing regimen ( median of two prior lines of therapy [ range 1 to 7 ] ) were retreated upon progression with bortezomib administered intravenously .
Patients were excluded from trial participation if they had peripheral neuropathy or neuropathic pain of Grade ≥ 2 .
At least six months after prior bortezomib therapy , bortezomib was restarted at the last tolerated dose of 1 . 3 mg / m2 ( n = 93 ) or ≤ 1 mg / m2 ( n = 37 ) and given on Days 1 , 4 , 8 and 11 every three weeks for maximum of eight cycles either as single agent or in combination with dexamethasone in accordance with the standard of care .
Dexamethasone was administered in combination with bortezomib to 83 patients in Cycle 1 with an additional 11 patients receiving dexamethasone during the course of bortezomib retreatment cycles .
The primary endpoint was best confirmed response to retreatment as assessed by European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation ( EBMT ) criteria .
Fifty of the 130 patients achieved a best confirmed response of Partial Response or better for an overall response rate of 38 . 5 % ( 95 % CI : 30 . 1 , 47 . 4 ) .
One patient achieved a Complete Response and 49 achieved Partial Response .
In the 50 responding patients , the median duration of response was 6 . 5 months and the range was 0 . 6 to 19 . 3 months .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Mantle Cell Lymphoma A Phase 2 Single - arm Clinical Study in Relapsed Mantle Cell Lymphoma After Prior Therapy The safety and efficacy of bortezomib in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma were evaluated in an open - label , single - arm , multicenter study ( NCT00063713 ) of 155 patients with progressive disease who had received at least 1 prior therapy .
The median age of the patients was 65 years ( 42 , 89 ) , 81 % were male , and 92 % were Caucasian .
Of the total , 75 % had one or more extra - nodal sites of disease , and 77 % were stage 4 .
In 91 % of the patients , prior therapy included all of the following : an anthracycline or mitoxantrone , cyclophosphamide , and rituximab .
A total of thirty seven percent ( 37 % ) of patients were refractory to their last prior therapy .
An intravenous bolus injection of bortezomib 1 . 3 mg / m2 / dose was administered twice weekly for 2 weeks on Days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 followed by a 10 - day rest period ( Days 12 to 21 ) for a maximum of 17 treatment cycles .
Patients achieving a CR or CRu were treated for 4 cycles beyond first evidence of CR or CRu .
The study employed dose modifications for toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 , 2 . 5 ) ] .
Responses to bortezomib are shown in Table 14 .
Response rates to bortezomib were determined according to the International Workshop Response Criteria ( IWRC ) based on independent radiologic review of CT scans .
The median number of cycles administered across all patients was 4 ; in responding patients the median number of cycles was 8 .
The median time to response was 40 days ( range 31 to 204 days ) .
The median duration of follow - up was more than 13 months .
