( 5 . 3 , 6 . 1 , 6 . 2 ) • Laboratory Coagulation Test Interference : HEMLIBRA interferes with activated clotting time ( ACT ) , activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) , and coagulation laboratory tests based on aPTT , including one - stage aPTT - based single - factor assays , aPTT - based Activated Protein C Resistance ( APC - R ) , and Bethesda assays ( clotting - based ) for factor VIII ( FVIII ) inhibitor titers .
Intrinsic pathway clotting - based laboratory tests should not be used .
( 5 . 4 , 7 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Thrombotic Microangiopathy Associated with HEMLIBRA and aPCC Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) were reported from clinical trials when on average a cumulative amount of > 100 U / kg / 24 hours of activated prothrombin complex concentrate ( aPCC ) was administered for 24 hours or more to patients receiving HEMLIBRA prophylaxis .
In clinical trials , thrombotic microangiopathy was reported in 0 . 8 % of patients ( 3 / 391 ) and in 8 . 1 % of patients ( 3 / 37 ) who received at least one dose of aPCC .
Patients presented with thrombocytopenia , microangiopathic hemolytic anemia , and acute kidney injury , without severe deficiencies in ADAMTS13 activity .
Evidence of improvement was seen within one week following discontinuation of aPCC .
One patient resumed HEMLIBRA following resolution of TMA .
Consider the benefits and risks if aPCC must be used in a patient receiving HEMLIBRA prophylaxis .
Due to the long half - life of HEMLIBRA , the potential for an interaction with aPCC may persist for up to 6 months after the last dose .
Monitor for the development of TMA when administering aPCC .
Immediately discontinue aPCC and interrupt HEMLIBRA prophylaxis if clinical symptoms and / or laboratory findings consistent with TMA occur , and manage as clinically indicated .
Consider the benefits and risks of resuming HEMLIBRA prophylaxis following complete resolution of TMA on a case - by - case basis .
5 . 2 Thromboembolism Associated with HEMLIBRA and aPCC Thrombotic events were reported from clinical trials when on average a cumulative amount of > 100 U / kg / 24 hours of aPCC was administered for 24 hours or more to patients receiving HEMLIBRA prophylaxis .
In clinical trials , thrombotic events were reported in 0 . 5 % of patients ( 2 / 391 ) and in 5 . 4 % of patients ( 2 / 37 ) who received at least one dose of aPCC .
No thrombotic event required anticoagulation therapy .
Evidence of improvement or resolution was seen within one month following discontinuation of aPCC .
One patient resumed HEMLIBRA following resolution of thrombotic event .
Consider the benefits and risks if aPCC must be used in a patient receiving HEMLIBRA prophylaxis .
Due to the long half - life of HEMLIBRA , the potential for an interaction with aPCC may persist for up to 6 months after the last dose .
Monitor for the development of thromboembolism when administering aPCC .
Immediately discontinue aPCC and interrupt HEMLIBRA prophylaxis if clinical symptoms , imaging , or laboratory findings consistent with thromboembolism occur , and manage as clinically indicated .
Consider the benefits and risks of resuming HEMLIBRA prophylaxis following complete resolution of thrombotic events on a case - by - case basis .
5 . 3 Immunogenicity Treatment with HEMLIBRA may induce anti - drug antibodies .
Anti - emicizumab - kxwh antibodies were reported in 5 . 1 % of patients ( 34 / 668 ) treated with HEMLIBRA in clinical trials .
Most patients with anti - emicizumab - kxwh antibodies did not experience a change in HEMLIBRA plasma concentrations or an increase in bleeding events ; however , in uncommon cases ( incidence < 1 % ) , the presence of neutralizing antibodies with decreasing plasma concentration may be associated with loss of efficacy [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 , 6 . 2 ) ] .
Monitor for clinical signs of loss of efficacy ( e . g . , increase in breakthrough bleeding events ) and if observed , promptly assess the etiology and consider a change in treatment if neutralizing anti - emicizumab - kxwh antibodies are suspected .
5 . 4 Laboratory Coagulation Test Interference HEMLIBRA affects intrinsic pathway clotting - based laboratory tests , including activated clotting time ( ACT ) , activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) , and all assays based on aPTT , such as one - stage factor VIII ( FVIII ) activity ( Table 1 ) .
Therefore , intrinsic pathway clotting - based laboratory test results in patients treated with HEMLIBRA should not be used to monitor HEMLIBRA activity , determine dosing for factor replacement or anti - coagulation , or measure FVIII inhibitor titers [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Laboratory tests affected and unaffected by HEMLIBRA are shown in Table 1 .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The following adverse reactions are based on pooled data from two randomized trials in adult and adolescent patients ( HAVEN 1 and HAVEN 3 ) , one single - arm trial in adult and adolescent patients ( HAVEN 4 ) , one single - arm trial in pediatric patients ( HAVEN 2 ) , and one dose - finding trial , in which a total of 391 male patients with hemophilia A received at least one dose of HEMLIBRA as routine prophylaxis .
Two hundred eighty - one patients ( 72 % ) were adults ( 18 years and older ) , 50 ( 13 % ) were adolescents ( 12 years up to less than 18 years ) , 55 ( 14 % ) were children ( 2 years up to less than 12 years ) , and five ( 1 % ) were infants ( 1 month up to less than 2 years ) .
The median duration of exposure across the studies was 34 . 1 weeks ( 0 . 1 to 224 . 4 weeks ) .
The most frequently reported adverse reactions observed in ≥ 10 % of patients treated with HEMLIBRA were injection site reactions , headache , and arthralgia .
Four patients ( 1 % ) in the clinical trials receiving HEMLIBRA prophylaxis withdrew from treatment due to adverse reactions , which were thrombotic microangiopathy , skin necrosis and superficial thrombophlebitis , headache , and injection site reaction .
One patient ( 1 / 668 ) withdrew from treatment after developing neutralizing anti - emicizumab - kxwh antibodies associated with loss of efficacy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Adverse reactions observed in patients who received HEMLIBRA are shown in Table 2 .
Table 2 Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥ 5 % of Patients from Pooled Clinical Trials with HEMLIBRABody System Adverse Reaction Number of Patients n ( % ) ( N = 391 ) General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Injection site reaction [ 1 ] 85 ( 22 % ) Pyrexia 23 ( 6 % ) Nervous System Disorders Headache 57 ( 15 % ) Gastrointestinal Disorders Diarrhea 22 ( 6 % ) Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Arthralgia 59 ( 15 % ) [ 1 ] Includes injection site bruising , injection site discomfort , injection site erythema , injection site hematoma , injection site induration , injection site pain , injection site pruritus , injection site rash , injection site reaction , injection site swelling , injection site urticaria , and injection site warmth .
Characterization of aPCC treatment in pooled clinical trials There were 130 instances of aPCC treatment in 37 patients , of which 13 instances ( 10 % ) consisted of on average a cumulative amount of > 100 U / kg / 24 hours of aPCC for 24 hours or more ; two of the 13 were associated with thrombotic events and three of the 13 were associated with TMA ( Table 3 ) .
No TMA or thrombotic events were associated with the remaining instances of aPCC treatment .

[ 2 ] Thrombotic event .
[ 3 ] Thrombotic microangiopathy .
Injection Site Reactions In total , 85 patients ( 22 % ) reported injection site reactions ( ISRs ) .
All ISRs observed in HEMLIBRA clinical trials were reported as mild to moderate intensity and 93 % resolved without treatment .
The commonly reported ISR symptoms were injection site erythema ( 11 % ) , injection site pain ( 4 % ) , and injection site pruritus ( 4 % ) .
Other Less Common ( < 1 % ) Reactions • Rhabdomyolysis Rhabdomyolysis was reported in two adult patients with asymptomatic elevations in serum creatine kinase without associated renal or musculoskeletal symptoms .
In both instances , the event occurred following an increase in physical activity .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is a potential for immunogenicity .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors , including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medication , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies to emicizumab - kxwh in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading .
The immunogenicity of HEMLIBRA was evaluated using an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) or an electrochemiluminescence ( ECL ) assay for anti - emicizumab - kxwh antibodies .
In the 7 phase III clinical trials , antibody positive samples were further evaluated for neutralizing anti - emicizumab - kxwh antibodies using a modified FVIII chromogenic assay .
A total of 668 patients were tested for anti - emicizumab - kxwh antibodies .
In the pooled phase III clinical trials , 5 . 1 % of patients ( 34 / 668 ) tested positive for anti - emicizumab - kxwh antibodies and 2 . 7 % of patients ( 18 / 668 ) developed anti - emicizumab - kxwh antibodies that were neutralizing in vitro .
The anti - emicizumab antibody positive rate may be under - reported due to the limitation of the assay .
Of these 18 patients , the neutralizing anti - emicizumab - kxwh antibodies did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics or efficacy of HEMLIBRA in 14 patients , while decreased emicizumab - kxwh plasma concentrations were observed in four patients ( 0 . 6 % ) .
One patient ( 0 . 2 % ) from HAVEN 2 , who developed neutralizing anti - emicizumab - kxwh antibodies and decreased emicizumab - kxwh plasma concentrations , experienced loss of efficacy ( manifest as breakthrough bleeding ) after 5 weeks of treatment and discontinued HEMLIBRA treatment .
Overall , the safety profile of HEMLIBRA was similar between those patients with anti - emicizumab - kxwh antibodies ( including neutralizing antibodies ) and those without [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of HEMLIBRA .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : rash , urticaria , angioedema 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Hypercoagulability with Concomitant Use of aPCC Clinical experience suggests that a drug interaction exists with HEMLIBRA and aPCC [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) ] .
7 . 2 Drug - Laboratory Test Interactions HEMLIBRA restores the tenase cofactor activity of missing activated factor VIII ( FVIIIa ) .
Coagulation laboratory tests based on intrinsic clotting ( i . e . , aPTT ) measure the total clotting time including time needed for activation of FVIII to FVIIIa by thrombin .
Such intrinsic pathway - based tests will yield overly shortened clotting times with HEMLIBRA , which does not require activation by thrombin .
The overly shortened intrinsic clotting time will then disturb all single - factor assays based on aPTT , such as the one - stage FVIII activity assay ; however , single - factor assays utilizing chromogenic or immuno - based methods are unaffected by HEMLIBRA and may be used to monitor coagulation parameters during treatment , with specific considerations for FVIII chromogenic activity assays as described below .
Chromogenic FVIII activity tests may be manufactured with either human or bovine coagulation proteins .
Assays containing human coagulation factors are responsive to HEMLIBRA but may overestimate the clinical hemostatic potential of HEMLIBRA .
In contrast , assays containing bovine coagulation factors are insensitive to HEMLIBRA ( no activity measured ) and can be used to monitor endogenous or infused FVIII activity , or to measure anti - FVIII inhibitors .
HEMLIBRA remains active in the presence of inhibitors against FVIII , so it will produce a false - negative result in clotting - based Bethesda assays for functional inhibition of FVIII .
Instead , a chromogenic Bethesda assay utilizing a bovine - based FVIII chromogenic test that is insensitive to HEMLIBRA may be used .
Due to the long half - life of HEMLIBRA , effects on coagulation assays may persist for up to 6 months after the last dose [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on HEMLIBRA use in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with emicizumab - kxwh .
It is not known whether HEMLIBRA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
HEMLIBRA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit for the mother outweighs the risk to the fetus .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defect and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 – 4 % and 15 – 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of emicizumab - kxwh in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Human IgG is known to be present in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for HEMLIBRA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from HEMLIBRA or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Women of childbearing potential should use contraception while receiving HEMLIBRA .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of HEMLIBRA have been established in pediatric patients .
Use of HEMLIBRA in pediatric patients with hemophilia A is supported by two randomized trials ( HAVEN 1 and HAVEN 3 ) and two single - arm trials ( HAVEN 2 and HAVEN 4 ) .
All clinical trials included pediatric patients in the following age group : 47 adolescents ( 12 years up to less than 18 years ) .
Only HAVEN 2 included pediatric patients in the following age groups : 55 children ( 2 years up to less than 12 years ) and five infants ( 1 month up to less than 2 years ) .
No differences in efficacy were observed between the different age groups [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The steady - state plasma trough concentrations of emicizumab - kxwh were comparable in adult and pediatric patients older than 6 months at equivalent weight - based doses .
Lower concentrations of emicizumab - kxwh were predicted in pediatric patients less than 6 months old [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In general , the adverse reactions in HEMLIBRA - treated pediatric patients were similar in type to those seen in adult patients with hemophilia A [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of HEMLIBRA did not include a sufficient number of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .

The absolute bioavailability following subcutaneous administration of 1 mg / kg was between 80 . 4 % and 93 . 1 % .
Similar pharmacokinetic profiles were observed following subcutaneous administration in the abdomen , upper arm , and thigh [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution ( % coefficient of variation [ % CV ] ) was 10 . 4 L ( 26 . 0 % ) .
Elimination The mean apparent clearance ( % CV ) was 0 . 27 L / day ( 28 . 4 % ) and the mean elimination apparent half - life ( ± SD ) was 26 . 9 ± 9 . 1 days .
Specific Populations The pharmacokinetics of emicizumab - kxwh are not influenced by age ( 1 year to 77 years ) , race ( White 62 . 7 % , Asian 22 . 9 % , and Black 8 % ) , inhibitor status ( inhibitor present , 50 % ) , mild hepatic impairment ( defined as total bilirubin 1 × to ≤ 1 . 5 × the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) and any aspartate transaminase ( AST ) level ) , moderate hepatic impairment ( defined as total bilirubin 1 . 5 × to ≤ 3 × the ULN and any AST level ) , mild renal impairment ( defined as creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) of 60 – 89 mL / min ) , and moderate renal impairment ( defined as CrCl of 30 – 59 mL / min ) .
Emicizumab - kxwh has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment .
In pediatric patients less than 6 months old , the predicted concentrations of emicizumab - kxwh were 19 % to 33 % lower than the older patients , especially with the 3 mg / kg once every two weeks or 6 mg / kg once every four weeks maintenance dose .
Body weight : The apparent clearance and volume of distribution of emicizumab - kxwh increased with increasing body weight ( 9 kg to 156 kg ) .
Dosing in mg / kg provides similar emicizumab - kxwh exposure across body weight range .
Drug Interaction Studies No drug - drug interaction studies have been conducted with HEMLIBRA .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Studies in animals investigating the carcinogenic effects of emicizumab - kxwh have not been conducted .
In vitro and in vivo testing of emicizumab - kxwh for genotoxicity was not conducted .
Animal fertility studies have not been conducted ; however , emicizumab - kxwh did not cause any toxicological changes in the reproductive organs of male or female cynomolgus monkeys at doses of up to 30 mg / kg / week in subcutaneous general toxicity studies of up to 26 - week duration and at doses of up to 100 mg / kg / week in a 4 - week intravenous general toxicity study .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Hemophilia A without FVIII Inhibitors The efficacy of HEMLIBRA for routine prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors was evaluated in two clinical trials [ adult and adolescent studies ( HAVEN 3 and HAVEN 4 ) ] .
HAVEN 3 ( Adult and Adolescent Patients ) The HAVEN 3 study ( NCT02847637 ) was a randomized , multicenter , open - label , clinical trial in 152 adult and adolescent males ( aged ≥ 12 years and ≥ 40 kg ) with hemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors who previously received either episodic ( on demand ) or prophylactic treatment with FVIII .
Patients received HEMLIBRA prophylaxis , 3 mg / kg once weekly for the first 4 weeks followed by either 1 . 5 mg / kg once every week [ Arms A and D ] or 3 mg / kg once every two weeks [ Arm B ] thereafter , or no prophylaxis ( Arm C ) .
Patients in Arm C could switch to HEMLIBRA prophylaxis ( 3 mg / kg once every two weeks ) after completing at least 24 weeks without prophylaxis .
For Arms A and B , dose up - titration to 3 mg / kg once every week was allowed after 24 weeks on HEMLIBRA prophylaxis for patients who experienced two or more qualified bleeds ( i . e . , spontaneous and clinically significant bleeds occurring at steady state ) .
For Arm D patients , dose up - titration was allowed after the second qualifying bleed .
During the study , five patients underwent up - titration of their maintenance dose ; however , this study was not designed to investigate the 3 mg / kg once every week dosing regimen .
Eighty - nine patients previously treated with episodic ( on demand ) FVIII were randomized in a 2 : 2 : 1 ratio to receive HEMLIBRA prophylaxis 1 . 5 mg / kg once every week ( Arm A ) , 3 mg / kg once every two weeks ( Arm B ) , or no prophylaxis ( Arm C ) , with stratification by prior 24 - week bleed rate ( < 9 or ≥ 9 ) .
Sixty - three patients previously treated with prophylactic FVIII were enrolled into Arm D to receive HEMLIBRA prophylaxis ( 1 . 5 mg / kg once every week ) .
Efficacy was evaluated after a minimum of 24 weeks of follow - up based on the bleed rate for bleeds requiring treatment with coagulation factors among patients previously treated with episodic ( on - demand ) FVIII who were randomized to HEMLIBRA prophylaxis 1 . 5 mg / kg once every week ( Arm A ) or 3 mg / kg once every two weeks ( Arm B ) compared with those receiving no prophylaxis ( Arm C ) .
The study also evaluated the randomized comparison of Arms A and C and Arms B and C for the efficacy of HEMLIBRA prophylaxis in reducing the number of all bleeds , spontaneous bleeds , joint bleeds , and target joint bleeds .
The efficacy of HEMLIBRA prophylaxis compared with previous prophylactic FVIII was also evaluated in patients who had participated in a non - interventional study ( NIS ) prior to enrollment ( Arm D ) .
Only patients from the NIS were included in this comparison , because bleed and treatment data were collected with the same level of granularity as that used in HAVEN 3 .
The efficacy results of HEMLIBRA prophylaxis ( 1 . 5 mg / kg once every week and 3 mg / kg once every two weeks ) compared with no prophylaxis with respect to rate of treated bleeds , all bleeds , treated spontaneous bleeds , treated joint bleeds , and treated target joint bleeds are shown in Table 5 .

HAVEN 4 ( Adult and Adolescent Patients ) The HAVEN 4 study ( NCT03020160 ) was a single - arm , multicenter , open - label , clinical trial in 41 adult and adolescent males ( aged ≥ 12 years and ≥ 40 kg ) with hemophilia A with or without FVIII inhibitors who previously received either episodic ( on demand ) or prophylactic treatment with FVIII or bypassing agents .
Patients received HEMLIBRA prophylaxis at 3 mg / kg once weekly for the first 4 weeks followed by 6 mg / kg once every four weeks thereafter .
Efficacy was evaluated in a subgroup of 36 patients with hemophilia A without FVIII inhibitors based on the bleed rate for bleeds requiring treatment with coagulation factors .
The study also evaluated the efficacy of HEMLIBRA prophylaxis on all bleeds , treated spontaneous bleeds , treated joint bleeds , and treated target joint bleeds .
The efficacy results of HEMLIBRA prophylaxis 6 mg / kg once every four weeks with respect to rate of treated bleeds , all bleeds , treated spontaneous bleeds , treated joint bleeds , and treated target joint bleeds are shown in Table 7 .
The median observation time was 25 . 6 weeks ( range 24 . 1 – 29 . 4 weeks ) .

14 . 2 Hemophilia A with FVIII Inhibitors The efficacy of HEMLIBRA for routine prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors was evaluated in three clinical trials [ adult and adolescent studies ( HAVEN 1 and HAVEN 4 ) and a pediatric study ( HAVEN 2 ) ] .
HAVEN 1 ( Adult and Adolescent Patients ) The HAVEN 1 study ( NCT02622321 ) was a randomized , multicenter , open - label , clinical trial in 109 adult and adolescent males ( aged ≥ 12 years and ≥ 40 kg ) with hemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors who previously received either episodic ( on - demand ) or prophylactic treatment with bypassing agents .
Patients received HEMLIBRA prophylaxis ( Arms A , C , and D ) , 3 mg / kg once weekly for the first 4 weeks followed by 1 . 5 mg / kg once every week thereafter , or no prophylaxis ( Arm B ) .
Patients in Arm B could switch to HEMLIBRA prophylaxis after completing at least 24 weeks without prophylaxis .
Dose up - titration to 3 mg / kg once every week was allowed after 24 weeks on HEMLIBRA prophylaxis for patients who experienced two or more qualified bleeds ( i . e . , spontaneous and clinically significant bleeds occurring at steady state ) .
During the study , two patients underwent up - titration of their maintenance dose ; however , this study was not designed to investigate the 3 mg / kg once every week dosing regimen .
Fifty - three patients previously treated with episodic ( on - demand ) bypassing agents were randomized in a 2 : 1 ratio to receive HEMLIBRA prophylaxis ( Arm A ) or no prophylaxis ( Arm B ) , with stratification by prior 24 - week bleed rate ( < 9 or ≥ 9 ) .
Forty - nine patients previously treated with prophylactic bypassing agents were enrolled into Arm C to receive HEMLIBRA prophylaxis .
Seven patients previously treated with episodic ( on - demand ) bypassing agents who had participated in the NIS prior to enrollment , but were unable to enroll into HAVEN 1 prior to the closure of Arms A and B , were enrolled into Arm D to receive HEMLIBRA prophylaxis .
Efficacy was evaluated after a minimum of 24 weeks of follow - up based on the bleed rate for bleeds requiring treatment with coagulation factors among patients previously treated with episodic bypassing agents who were randomized to HEMLIBRA prophylaxis ( Arm A ) compared with those receiving no prophylaxis ( Arm B ) .
The study also evaluated the randomized comparison of Arms A and B for the efficacy of HEMLIBRA prophylaxis in reducing the number of all bleeds , spontaneous bleeds , joint bleeds , and target joint bleeds , as well as patient - reported symptoms and physical functioning .
The efficacy of HEMLIBRA prophylaxis compared with previous prophylactic bypassing agents was also evaluated in patients who had participated in the NIS prior to enrollment ( Arm C ) .
Only patients from the NIS were included in this comparison , because bleed and treatment data were collected with the same level of granularity as that used in HAVEN 1 .
The efficacy results of HEMLIBRA prophylaxis 1 . 5 mg / kg once every week compared with no prophylaxis with respect to rate of treated bleeds , all bleeds , treated spontaneous bleeds , treated joint bleeds , and treated target joint bleeds are shown in Table 8 .

The HAVEN 1 study evaluated patient - reported hemophilia - related symptoms ( painful swellings and presence of joint pain ) and physical functioning ( pain with movement and difficulty walking far ) using the Physical Health Score of the Haemophilia - specific Quality of Life ( Haem - A - QoL ) questionnaire for patients ≥ 18 years of age .
The HEMLIBRA prophylaxis arm ( Arm A ) showed an improvement compared with the no prophylaxis arm ( Arm B ) in the Haem - A - QoL Physical Health Subscale score at the Week 25 assessment ( Table 11 ) .
The improvement in the Physical Health Score was further supported by the Total Score as measured by the Haem - A - QoL at Week 25 .

HAVEN 2 ( Pediatric Patients ) The HAVEN 2 study ( NCT02795767 ) was a single - arm , multicenter , open - label , clinical trial in pediatric males ( age < 12 years , or 12 – 17 years who weigh < 40 kg ) with hemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors .
Patients received HEMLIBRA prophylaxis at 3 mg / kg once weekly for the first 4 weeks followed by 1 . 5 mg / kg once every week thereafter .
The study evaluated the efficacy of HEMLIBRA prophylaxis , including the efficacy of HEMLIBRA prophylaxis compared with previous episodic ( on - demand ) and prophylactic bypassing agent treatment in patients who had participated in a non - interventional study ( NIS ) prior to enrollment ( intra - patient analysis ) .
At the time of the interim analysis , efficacy was evaluated in 59 pediatric patients who were < 12 years of age and had been receiving HEMLIBRA prophylaxis for at least 12 weeks , including 38 patients age 6 to < 12 years , 17 patients age 2 to < 6 years , and four patients age < 2 years .
Annualized bleed rate ( ABR ) and percent of patients with zero bleeds were calculated for 59 patients ( Table 12 ) .
The median observation time for these patients was 29 . 6 weeks ( range 18 . 4 – 63 weeks ) .

In the intra - patient analysis , 18 pediatric patients who had participated in the NIS had an ABR for treated bleeds of 19 . 8 ( 95 % CI [ 15 . 3 , 25 . 7 ] ) on previous bypassing agent treatment ( prophylactic treatment in 15 patients and on - demand treatment for 3 patients ) .
HEMLIBRA prophylaxis resulted in an ABR for treated bleeds of 0 . 4 ( 95 % CI [ 0 . 2 , 0 . 9 ] ) based on negative binomial regression , corresponding to a 98 % reduction in bleed rate .
On HEMLIBRA prophylaxis , 14 patients ( 77 . 8 % ) had zero treated bleeds .
The HAVEN 2 study evaluated patient - reported hemophilia - related symptoms ( painful swellings and presence of joint pain ) and physical functioning ( pain with movement ) using the Physical Health Score of the Hemophilia - specific Quality of Life Short Form ( Haemo - QoL - SF ) questionnaire for patients ≥ 8 to < 12 years of age .
HEMLIBRA prophylaxis showed improvement from baseline in the Haemo - QoL - SF Physical Health Subscale score at the Week 25 assessment .
HAVEN 4 ( Adult and Adolescent Patients ) The HAVEN 4 study ( NCT03020160 ) was a single - arm , multicenter , open - label , clinical trial in 41 adult and adolescent males ( aged ≥ 12 years and ≥ 40 kg ) with hemophilia A with or without FVIII inhibitors who previously received either episodic ( on demand ) or prophylactic treatment with FVIII or bypassing agents .
Patients received HEMLIBRA prophylaxis at 3 mg / kg once weekly for the first 4 weeks followed by 6 mg / kg once every four weeks thereafter .
Efficacy was evaluated in a subgroup of 5 patients with hemophilia A with FVIII inhibitors based on the bleed rate for bleeds requiring treatment with coagulation factors .
The median observation time was 26 . 1 weeks ( range 24 . 4 – 28 . 6 weeks ) .
HEMLIBRA prophylaxis resulted in an ABR ( 95 % CI ) for treated bleeds of 1 . 2 ( 0 . 1 , 14 . 8 ) based on negative binomial regression .
On HEMLIBRA prophylaxis , 4 patients had zero treated bleeds .
The efficacy results of HEMLIBRA prophylaxis ( 1 . 5 mg / kg once every week , 3 mg / kg once every two weeks , and 6 mg / kg once every four weeks ) with respect to rate of treated bleeds are shown in Table 13 .
