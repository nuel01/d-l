5 . 1 Differentiation Syndrome in AML In the combination study AG120 - C - 009 , 15 % ( 11 / 71 ) patients with newly diagnosed AML treated with TIBSOVO plus azacitidine experienced differentiation syndrome [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Differentiation syndrome is associated with rapid proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells and may be life - threatening or fatal .
Symptoms of differentiation syndrome in patients treated with TIBSOVO included noninfectious leukocytosis , peripheral edema , pyrexia , dyspnea , pleural effusion , hypotension , hypoxia , pulmonary edema , pneumonitis , pericardial effusion , rash , fluid overload , tumor lysis syndrome and creatinine increased .
Of the 11 patients with newly diagnosed AML who experienced differentiation syndrome with TIBSOVO plus azacitidine 8 ( 73 % ) recovered .
Differentiation syndrome occurred as early as 3 days after start of therapy and during the first month on treatment .
In the monotherapy clinical trial AG120 - C - 001 , 25 % ( 7 / 28 ) of patients with newly diagnosed AML and 19 % ( 34 / 179 ) of patients with relapsed or refractory AML treated with TIBSOVO experienced differentiation syndrome [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Of the 7 patients with newly diagnosed AML who experienced differentiation syndrome , 6 ( 86 % ) patients recovered .
Of the 34 patients with relapsed or refractory AML who experienced differentiation syndrome , 27 ( 79 % ) patients recovered after treatment or after dose interruption of TIBSOVO .
Differentiation syndrome occurred as early as 1 day and up to 3 months after TIBSOVO initiation and has been observed with or without concomitant leukocytosis .
If differentiation syndrome is suspected , initiate dexamethasone 10 mg IV every 12 hours ( or an equivalent dose of an alternative oral or IV corticosteroid ) and hemodynamic monitoring until improvement [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
If concomitant noninfectious leukocytosis is observed , initiate treatment with hydroxyurea or leukapheresis , as clinically indicated .
Taper corticosteroids and hydroxyurea after resolution of symptoms and administer corticosteroids for a minimum of 3 days .
Symptoms of differentiation syndrome may recur with premature discontinuation of corticosteroid and / or hydroxyurea treatment .
If severe signs and / or symptoms persist for more than 48 hours after initiation of corticosteroids , interrupt TIBSOVO until signs and symptoms are no longer severe [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 2 QTc Interval Prolongation Patients treated with TIBSOVO can develop QT ( QTc ) prolongation [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] and ventricular arrhythmias .
Of the 71 patients with newly diagnosed AML treated with TIBSOVO in combination with azacitidine in the clinical trial ( Study AG120 - C - 009 ) , 10 ( 14 % ) were found to have a heart - rate corrected QT interval ( using Fridericia ' s method ) ( QTcF ) greater than 500 msec and 15 out of 69 ( 22 % ) had an increase from baseline QTcF greater than 60 msec [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The clinical trial excluded patients with a QTcF ≥ 470 msec or other factors that increased the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic events ( e . g . NYHA Class III or IV congestive heart failure , hypokalemia , family history of long QT interval syndrome ) .
Of the 258 patients with hematological malignancies treated with TIBSOVO monotherapy in the clinical trial ( AG120 - C - 001 ) , 9 % were found to have a QTc interval greater than 500 msec and 14 % of patients had an increase from baseline QTc greater than 60 msec [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
One patient developed ventricular fibrillation attributed to TIBSOVO .
The clinical trial excluded patients with baseline QTc of ≥ 450 msec ( unless the QTc ≥ 450 msec was due to a pre - existing bundle branch block ) or with a history of long QT syndrome or uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease .
Of the 123 patients with cholangiocarcinoma treated with TIBSOVO in the clinical trial ( Study AG120 - C - 005 ) , 2 % were found to have a QTc interval greater than 500 msec .
and 5 % of patients had an increase from baseline QTc greater than 60 msec [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The clinical trial excluded patients with a heart - rate corrected QT interval ( using Fridericia ' s formula ) ( QTcF ) ≥ 450 msec or other factors that increased the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic events ( e . g . , heart failure , hypokalemia , family history of long QT interval syndrome ) .
Concomitant use of TIBSOVO with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval ( e . g . , anti - arrhythmic medicines , fluoroquinolones , triazole anti - fungals , 5 - HT3 receptor antagonists ) and CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the risk of QTc interval prolongation [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Conduct monitoring of electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) and electrolytes [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
In patients with congenital long QTc syndrome , congestive heart failure , electrolyte abnormalities , or those who are taking medications known to prolong the QTc interval , more frequent monitoring may be necessary .
Interrupt TIBSOVO if QTc increases to greater than 480 msec and less than 500 msec .
Interrupt and reduce TIBSOVO if QTc increases to greater than 500 msec .
Permanently discontinue TIBSOVO in patients who develop QTc interval prolongation with signs or symptoms of life - threatening arrhythmia [ See Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 3 Guillain - Barré Syndrome Guillain - Barré syndrome can develop in patients treated with TIBSOVO .
Guillain - Barré syndrome occurred in < 1 % ( 2 / 258 ) of patients treated with TIBSOVO in study AG120 - C - 001 [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor patients taking TIBSOVO for onset of new signs or symptoms of motor and / or sensory neuropathy such as unilateral or bilateral weakness , sensory alterations , paresthesias , or difficulty breathing .
Permanently discontinue TIBSOVO in patients who are diagnosed with Guillain - Barré syndrome [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise women not to breastfeed ( 8 . 2 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal embryo - fetal toxicity studies , TIBSOVO may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no available data on TIBSOVO use in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage .
In animal embryo - fetal toxicity studies , oral administration of ivosidenib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis was associated with embryo - fetal mortality and alterations to growth starting at 2 times the steady state clinical exposure based on the AUC at the recommended human dose ( see Data ) .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , advise the patient of the potential risk to a fetus .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % - 4 % and 15 % - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Ivosidenib administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 500 mg / kg / day during organogenesis ( gestation days 6 - 17 ) was associated with adverse embryo - fetal effects including lower fetal weights , and skeletal variations .
These effects occurred in rats at approximately 2 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 500 mg daily .
In pregnant rabbits treated during organogenesis ( gestation days 7 - 20 ) , ivosidenib was maternally toxic at doses of 180 mg / kg / day ( exposure approximately 3 . 9 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 500 mg daily ) and caused spontaneous abortions as well as decreased fetal weights , skeletal variations , and visceral variations .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ivosidenib or its metabolites in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed children , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with TIBSOVO and for 1 month after the last dose .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of TIBSOVO in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 72 patients with newly diagnosed AML treated with TIBSOVO in combination with azacitidine , 94 % were 65 years of age or older , and 54 % were 75 years or older .

11 DESCRIPTION TIBSOVO ( ivosidenib ) is an inhibitor of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ( IDH1 ) enzyme .
The chemical name is ( 2 S ) - N - { ( 1 S ) - 1 - ( 2 - chlorophenyl ) - 2 - [ ( 3 , 3 - difluorocyclobutyl ) - amino ] - 2 - oxoethyl } - 1 - ( 4 - cyanopyridin - 2 - yl ) - N - ( 5 - fluoropyridin - 3 - yl ) - 5 - oxopyrrolidine - 2 - carboxamide .
The chemical structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The molecular formula is C28H22ClF3N6O3 and the molecular weight is 583 . 0 g / mol .
Ivosidenib is practically insoluble in aqueous solutions between pH 1 . 2 and 7 . 4 .
TIBSOVO ( ivosidenib ) is available as a film - coated 250 mg tablet for oral administration .
Each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients : colloidal silicon dioxide , croscarmellose sodium , hypromellose acetate succinate , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose , and sodium lauryl sulfate .
The tablet coating includes FD & C blue # 2 , hypromellose , lactose monohydrate , titanium dioxide , and triacetin .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Ivosidenib is a small molecule inhibitor that targets the mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ( IDH1 ) enzyme .
In patients with AML , susceptible IDH1 mutations are defined as those leading to increased levels of 2 - hydroxyglutarate ( 2 - HG ) in the leukemia cells and where efficacy is predicted by 1 ) clinically meaningful remissions with the recommended dose of ivosidenib and / or 2 ) inhibition of mutant IDH1 enzymatic activity at concentrations of ivosidenib sustainable at the recommended dosage according to validated methods .
The most common of such mutations in patients with AML are R132H and R132C substitutions .
Ivosidenib was shown to inhibit selected IDH1 R132 mutants at much lower concentrations than wild - type IDH1 in vitro .
Inhibition of the mutant IDH1 enzyme by ivosidenib led to decreased 2 - HG levels and induced myeloid differentiation in vitro and in vivo in mouse xenograft models of IDH1 - mutated AML .
In blood samples from patients with AML with mutated IDH1 , ivosidenib decreased 2 - HG levels ex - vivo , reduced blast counts , and increased percentages of mature myeloid cells .
In a patient - derived xenograft intra - hepatic cholangiocarcinoma mouse model with IDH1 R132C , ivosidenib reduced 2 - HG levels .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Multiple doses of ivosidenib 500 mg daily were observed to decrease plasma 2 - HG concentrations in patients with hematological malignancies and cholangiocarcinoma to levels similar to those observed at baseline in healthy subjects .
In bone marrow of patients with hematological malignancies and in tumor biopsy of patients with cholangiocarcinoma , the mean [ % coefficient of variation ( % CV ) ] reduction in 2 - HG concentrations were 93 . 1 % ( 11 . 1 % ) and 82 . 2 % ( 32 . 4 % ) , respectively .
Cardiac Electrophysiology The mean increase in QTc was 17 msec ( UCI : 20 msec ) following administration of TIBSOVO 500 mg in patients with newly diagnosed AML and patients with relapsed or refractory AML .
The increase in QTc interval was concentration - dependent [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
A similar mean increase of 17 msec following administration of TIBSOVO 500 mg daily was observed in patients with solid tumors , including patients with cholangiocarcinoma .
Co - administration with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors is expected to further increase QTc interval prolongation from baseline .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The AUC and Cmax of ivosidenib increase in a less than dose - proportional manner from 200 mg to 1 , 200 mg daily ( 0 . 4 to 2 . 4 times the approved recommended dosage ) .
The following ivosidenib pharmacokinetic parameters ( Table 10 ) were observed following administration of ivosidenib 500 mg as a single dose or daily dose ( for steady state ) , unless otherwise specified .
The steady - state pharmacokinetics of ivosidenib 500 mg were comparable between patients with newly diagnosed AML and relapsed or refractory AML and were lower in patients with cholangiocarcinoma .

The pharmacokinetics of ivosidenib in patients with severe renal impairment ( eGFR < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 , MDRD ) or renal impairment requiring dialysis or severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) is unknown .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Model - Based Approaches Effect of Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors on Ivosidenib Co - administration of 250 mg ivosidenib with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ( 200 mg itraconazole once daily for 18 days ) increased ivosidenib single - dose AUC by 269 % ( 90 % CI : 245 % , 295 % ) with no change in Cmax in healthy subjects .
Co - administration of 500 mg ivosidenib with the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole ( dosed to steady - state ) increases ivosidenib single - dose AUC by 173 % with no change in Cmax .
Co - administration of fluconazole following multiple daily ivosidenib doses is predicted to increase ivosidenib steady - state Cmax by 152 % and AUC by 190 % .
Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers on Ivosidenib Co - administration of ivosidenib with a strong CYP3A4 inducer ( 600 mg rifampin once daily for 15 days ) is predicted to decrease ivosidenib steady - state AUC by 33 % .
Effect of Ivosidenib on CYP3A4 Substrates Ivosidenib induces CYP3A4 , including its own metabolism .
Co - administration of ivosidenib with CYP3A4 substrates , including certain azole anti - fungal agents , is expected to decrease CYP3A4 substrate steady - state AUC .
Effect of Gastric Acid Reducing Agents on Ivosidenib No clinically significant ivosidenib pharmacokinetic differences were observed following co - administration with gastric acid reducing agents ( e . g . , proton pump inhibitors , H2 - receptor antagonists , antacids ) .
In vitro Studies Metabolic Pathways Ivosidenib may induce CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , and CYP2C9 .
Drug Transporter Systems Ivosidenib is a substrate for P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) .
Ivosidenib is not a substrate for BCRP or hepatic transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 .

[ 2 ] DOCR ( duration of CR ) , DOCRh ( duration of CRh ) , and DOCR + CRh ( duration of CR + CRh ) was defined as time since first response of CR , CRh or CR / CRh , respectively , to relapse or death , whichever is earlier .
[ 3 ] CRh ( complete remission with partial hematological recovery ) was defined as < 5 % blasts in the bone marrow , no evidence of disease , and partial recovery of peripheral blood counts ( platelets > 50 , 000 / microliter and ANC > 500 / microliter ) .
[ 4 ] CR + CRh rate appeared to be consistent across all baseline demographic and baseline disease characteristics with the exception of number of prior regimens .
For patients who achieved a CR or CRh , the median time to CR or CRh was 2 months ( range , 0 . 9 to 5 . 6 months ) .
Of the 57 patients who achieved a best response of CR or CRh , all achieved a first response of CR or CRh within 6 months of initiating TIBSOVO .
Among the 110 patients who were dependent on red blood cell ( RBC ) and / or platelet transfusions at baseline , 41 ( 37 . 3 % ) became independent of RBC and platelet transfusions during any 56 - day post - baseline period .
Of the 64 patients who were independent of both RBC and platelet transfusions at baseline , 38 ( 59 . 4 % ) remained transfusion independent during any 56 - day post - baseline period .
14 . 3 Locally Advanced or Metastatic Cholangiocarcinoma The efficacy of TIBSOVO was evaluated in a randomized ( 2 : 1 ) , multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trial ( Study AG120 - C - 005 , NCT02989857 ) of 185 adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma with an IDH1 mutation whose disease had progressed following at least 1 but not more than 2 prior regimens , including at least one gemcitabine - or 5 - FU - containing regimen .
Patients were randomized to receive either TIBSOVO 500 mg orally once daily or matched placebo until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Randomization was stratified by number of prior therapies ( 1 or 2 ) .
Eligible patients who were randomized to placebo were allowed to cross over to receive TIBSOVO after documented radiographic disease progression .
Patients with IDH1 mutations were selected using a central diagnostic next generation sequencing assay .
Tumor imaging assessments were performed every 6 weeks for the first 8 assessments and every 8 weeks thereafter .
The major efficacy outcome measure was Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) as determined by independent review committee ( IRC ) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1 . 1 .
The median age was 62 years ( range : 33 to 83 ) ; 63 % were female ; 57 % were White , 12 % Asian , 1 . 1 % Black , 0 . 5 % Native Hawaiian / Other Pacific Islander , 0 . 5 % American Indian or Alaska Native , 28 % race missing / not reported ; and 37 % had an ECOG performance status of 0 ( 37 % ) or 1 ( 62 % ) .
All patients received at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy and 47 % received two prior lines .
Most patients had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( 91 % ) at diagnosis and 92 % had metastatic disease .
Across both arms , 70 % patients had an R132C mutation , 15 % had an R132L mutation , 12 % had an R132G mutation , 1 . 1 % had an R132H mutation , and 1 . 6 % had an R132S mutation .
The efficacy results are shown in Table 17 and Figure 2 .
The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS .
