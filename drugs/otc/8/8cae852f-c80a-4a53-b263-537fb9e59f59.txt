[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Chlordiazepoxide HCl has antianxiety , sedative , appetite - stimulating and weak analgesic actions .
The precise mechanism of action is not known .
The drug blocks EEG arousal from stimulation of the brain stem reticular formation .
It takes several hours for peak blood levels to be reached and the half - life of the drug is between 24 and 48 hours .
After the drug is discontinued plasma levels decline slowly over a period of several days .
Chlordiazepoxide is excreted in the urine , with 1 % to 2 % unchanged and 3 % to 6 % as conjugate .
Animal Pharmacology The drug has been studied extensively in many species of animals and these studies are suggestive of action on the limbic system of the brain , which recent evidence indicates is involved in emotional responses .
Hostile monkeys were made tame by oral drug doses which did not cause sedation .
Chlordiazepoxide HCl revealed a “ taming ” action with the elimination of fear and aggression .
The taming effect of chlordiazepoxide HCl was further demonstrated in rats made vicious by lesions in the septal area of the brain .
The drug dosage which effectively blocked the vicious reaction was well below the dose which caused sedation in these animals .
The LD50 of parenterally administered chlordiazepoxide HCl was determined in mice ( 72 hours ) and rats ( 5 days ) , and calculated according to the method of Miller and Tainter , with the following results : mice , IV , 123 ± 12 mg / kg ; mice , IM , 366 ± 7 mg / kg ; rats , IV , 120 ± 7 mg / kg ; rats , IM , > 160 mg / kg .
Effects on Reproduction Reproduction studies in rats fed 10 , 20 and 80 mg / kg daily and bred through one or two matings showed no congenital anomalies , nor were there adverse effects on lactation of the dams or growth of the newborn .
However , in another study at 100 mg / kg daily there was noted a significant decrease in the fertilization rate and a marked decrease in the viability and body weight of off - spring which may be attributable to sedative activity , thus resulting in lack of interest in mating and lessened maternal nursing and care of the young .
One neonate in each of the first and second matings in the rat reproduction study at the 100 mg / kg dose exhibited major skeletal defects .
Further studies are in progress to determine the significance of these findings .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Chlordiazepoxide HCl capsules USP are indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short term relief of symptoms of anxiety , withdrawal symptoms of acute alcoholism , and preoperative apprehension and anxiety .
Anxiety or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not require treatment with an anxiolytic .
The effectiveness of chlordiazepoxide HCl capsules USP in long term use , that is , more than 4 months , has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies .
The physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Chlordiazepoxide HCl capsules are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug .
WARNINGS Chlordiazepoxide HCl may impair the mental and / or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a vehicle or operating machinery .
Similarly , it may impair mental alertness in children .
The concomitant use of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants may have an additive effect .
PATIENTS SHOULD BE WARNED ACCORDINGLY .
Usage in Pregnancy An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of minor tranquilizers ( chlordiazepoxide , diazepam and meprobamate ) during the first trimester of pregnancy has been suggested in several studies .
Because use of these drugs is rarely a matter of urgency , their use during this period should almost always be avoided .
The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered .
Patients should be advised that if they become pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant they should communicate with their physicians about the desirability of discontinuing the drug .
Withdrawal symptoms of the barbiturate type have occurred after the discontinuation of benzodiazepines ( see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE section ) .
PRECAUTIONS In elderly and debilitated patients , it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia or oversedation ( 10 mg or less per day initially , to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated ) .
In general , the concomitant administration of chlordiazepoxide HCl and other psychotropic agents is not recommended .
If such combination therapy seems indicated , careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed — particularly when the known potentiating compounds such as MAO inhibitors and phenothiazines are to be used .
The usual precautions in treating patients with impaired renal or hepatic function should be observed .
Paradoxical reactions , e . g . , excitement , stimulation and acute rage , have been reported in psychiatric patients and in hyperactive aggressive pediatric patients , and should be watched for during chlordiazepoxide HCl therapy .
The usual precautions are indicated when chlordiazepoxide HCl is used in the treatment of anxiety states where there is any evidence of impending depression ; it should be borne in mind that suicidal tendencies may be present and protective measures may be necessary .
Although clinical studies have not established a cause and effect relationship , physicians should be aware that variable effects on blood coagulation have been reported very rarely in patients receiving oral anticoagulants and chlordiazepoxide HCl .
In view of isolated reports associating chlordiazepoxide with exacerbation of porphyria , caution should be exercised in prescribing chlordiazepoxide to patients suffering from this disease .
Pediatric Use Because of the varied response of pediatric patients to CNS - acting drugs , therapy should be initiated with the lowest dose and increased as required ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Since clinical experience with chlordiazepoxide HCl in pediatric patients under 6 years of age is limited , use in this age group is not recommended .
Hyperactive aggressive pediatric patients should be monitored for paradoxical reactions to chlordiazepoxide HCl ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
Information for Patients To assure the safe and effective use of benzodiazepines , patients should be informed that , since benzodiazepines may produce psychological and physical dependence , it is advisable that they consult with their physician before either increasing the dose or abruptly discontinuing this drug .
ADVERSE REACTIONS The necessity of discontinuing therapy because of undesirable effects has been rare .
Drowsiness , ataxia and confusion have been reported in some patients — particularly the elderly and debilitated .
While these effects can be avoided in almost all instances by proper dosage adjustment , they have occasionally been observed at the lower dosage ranges .
In a few instances syncope has been reported .
Other adverse reactions reported during therapy include isolated instances of skin eruptions , edema , minor menstrual irregularities , nausea and constipation , extrapyramidal symptoms , as well as increased and decreased libido .
Such side effects have been infrequent , and are generally controlled with reduction of dosage .
Changes in EEG patterns ( low - voltage fast activity ) have been observed in patients during and after chlordiazepoxide HCl treatment .
Blood dyscrasias ( including agranulocytosis ) , jaundice and hepatic dysfunction have occasionally been reported during therapy .
When chlordiazepoxide HCl treatment is protracted , periodic blood counts and liver function tests are advisable .
DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride capsules are classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule IV controlled substance .
Withdrawal symptoms , similar in character to those noted with barbiturates and alcohol ( convulsions , tremor , abdominal and muscle cramps , vomiting and sweating ) , have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of chlordiazepoxide .
The more severe withdrawal symptoms have usually been limited to those patients who had received excessive doses over an extended period of time .
Generally milder withdrawal symptoms ( e . g . , dysphoria and insomnia ) have been reported following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines taken continuously at therapeutic levels for several months .
Consequently , after extended therapy , abrupt discontinuation should generally be avoided and a gradual dosage tapering schedule followed .
Addiction - prone individuals ( such as drug addicts or alcoholics ) should be under careful surveillance when receiving chlordiazepoxide or other psychotropic agents because of the predisposition of such patients to habituation and dependence .
OVERDOSAGE Manifestations of chlordiazepoxide overdosage includes somnolence , confusion , coma and diminished reflexes .
Respiration , pulse and blood pressure should be monitored , as in all cases of drug overdosage , although , in general , these effects have been minimal following chlordiazepoxide HCl overdosage .
General supportive measures should be employed , along with immediate gastric lavage .
Intravenous fluids should be administered and an adequate airway maintained .
Hypotension may be combated by the use of norepinephrine or metaraminol .
Dialysis is of limited value .
There have been occasional reports of excitation in patients following chlordiazepoxide HCl overdosage ; if this occurs barbiturates should not be used .
As with the management of intentional overdosage with any drug , it should be borne in mind that multiple agents may have been ingested .
Flumazenil , a specific benzodiazepine - receptor antagonist , is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and may be used in situations when an overdose with a benzodiazepine is known or suspected .
Prior to the administration of flumazenil , necessary measures should be instituted to secure airway , ventilation and intravenous access .
Flumazenil is intended as an adjunct to , not as a substitute for , proper management of benzodiazepine overdose .
Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for resedation , respiratory depression and other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period after treatment .
The prescriber should be aware of a risk of seizure in association with flumazenil treatment , particularly in long term benzodiazepine users and in cyclic antidepressant overdose .
The complete flumazenil package insert , including CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS , should be consulted prior to use .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Because of the wide range of clinical indications for chlordiazepoxide HCl , the optimum dosage varies with the diagnosis and response of the individual patient .
The dosage , therefore , should be individualized for maximum beneficial effects .
ADULTS USUAL DAILY DOSE Relief of Mild and Moderate Anxiety Disorders and Symptoms of Anxiety 5 mg or 10 mg , 3 or 4 times daily Relief of Severe Anxiety Disorders and Symptoms of Anxiety 20 mg or 25 mg , 3 or 4 times daily Geriatric Patients , or in the presence of debilitating disease .

PEDIATRIC PATIENTS USUAL DAILY DOSE Because of the varied response of pediatric patients to CNS - acting drugs , therapy should be initiated with the lowest dose and increased as required .
Since clinical experience in pediatric patients under 6 years of age is limited , the use of the drug in this age group is not recommended .
5 mg , 2 to 4 times daily ( may be increased in some pediatric patients to 10 mg , 2 to 3 times daily ) For the relief of withdrawal symptoms of acute alcoholism , the parenteral form * is usually used initially .
If the drug is administered orally , the suggested initial dose is 50 to 100 mg , to be followed by repeated doses as needed until agitation is controlled — up to 300 mg per day .
Dosage should then be reduced to maintenance levels .
