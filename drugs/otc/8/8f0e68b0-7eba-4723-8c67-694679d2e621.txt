c ) Confirm the needle is completely enclosed and securely locked into the needle guard .
20 .
Remove and discard the Y - Sampling Site and needle guard into an appropriate biohazardous waste container following established procedures .
If donor tubing is also to be discarded , hermetically seal donor tubing directly above the primary container and remove .
Note : Step 21 may be performed prior to step 20 if desired .
21 .
If the donor tubing is not hermetically sealed directly above the primary container , then strip the blood from the remaining donor tubing into the primary container and mix .
If desired , allow tubing to refill .
Component Preparation : Notes : • If a platelet concentrate is to be prepared , it should be separated within 8 hours after blood collection .
• Fresh frozen plasma should be separated from the red blood cells and placed in the freezer at - 18 ° C or colder within 8 hours after blood collection .
• Adsol red cell preservation solution should be added to the red blood cells immediately after the removal of plasma .
Preparation of AS - 1 red blood cells may vary depending on processing option selected : a ) Within 8 hours of blood collection if whole blood is held at ambient temperature .
b ) Within 3 days of blood collection if whole blood is refrigerated .
22 .
At the appropriate time , prepare the Blood - Pack Unit with Integral Filter for centrifugation .
23 .
Thoroughly mix the primary container end over end .
24 .
Load the Blood - Pack Unit into a centrifuge cup per the instructions on page 3 or 4 .
Page 3 describes Option A , the method of centrifuge cup loading when using standard oval centrifuge cups .
Page 4 describes Option B , the method of centrifuge cup loading when using large oval centrifuge cups .
this method differs from Option A in steps 7 - 9 only and shows the use of a blood bag insert to help fill extra space inside the cup .
Notes : • This guide is one method for centrifuge cup loading and applies to all Bioflex RC configurations .
The specific stacking order and methods may vary depending on the workstation setup , centrifuge equipment , and your facilities Standard Operating Procedures .
• It is important to pack the filter properly in the centrifugation cup to avoid damage to the filter during centrifugation .
• Do not place the filter in the lower half of the centrifuge cup .
See step 3 on page 3 or 4 for proper placement of filter .
• Do not press directly on the cannulae while performing any of the cup loading steps as this may cause pre - activation of the cannulae .
25 .
After loading the Blood - Pack unit into the centrifuge cup , perform centrifugation according to center procedures .
26 .
Following centrifugation , remove containers from the centrifuge cup taking care not to disturb the red blood cell / plasma interface .
27 .
Place the primary container in a plasma extractor and apply pressure .
Clamp off tubing above the filter to prevent plasma flow into the filter during plasma transfer .
If applicable , clamp off tubing below the Y - Junction leading to the secondary Transfer - Pack container not to be filled with plasma .
Open the cannula on the top of the primary container to transfer plasma into the empty Transfer - Pack container .
28 .
When the desired amount of plasma has been removed , clamp the tubing between the plasma container and the Y - connector closest to the plasma container and release pressure on the primary container .
Seal and remove satellite container ( s ) .
29 .
Suspend the Adsol red cell preservation solution container , ensuring that the primary container remains below the level of the filter during prime .
Open the cannula on the Adsol solution container and remove the clamp between the primary container and the filter .
Allow the Adsol to drain through the filter into the primary container .
Clamp the tubing between the filter and the primary container after prime is complete .
30 .
Mix the Adsol red cell preservation solution and red cells thoroughly .
Note : If the Adsol red cell preservation solution is not added to the red cells , ensure appropriate labeling of the red cell container .
Also ensure that tubing with unique segment numbers are attached as the primary container does not include tubing with segment numbers .
Manufacture of CPD Red Cells for transfusion must include proper labeling of the container as well as attached tubing with unique segment numbers .
A CPD red cell without Adsol red cell preservation solution may be stored between 1 and 6ºC up to 21 days after collection .
The attached Bioflex RC filter should not be used to leukoreduce a CPD red cell without Adsol red cell preservation solution .
Filtration Procedure : Precaution : Red blood cell products collected from certain donors may have extended filtration times and the potential for ineffective filtration and leukoreduction .
31 .
Mix unfiltered AS - 1 red blood cells thoroughly .
Invert the unfiltered AS - 1 red blood cells and hang the filter set such that the filter remains vertical .
Filtration may be performed from 165 cm up to full length .
To achieve maximum flow rate , allow the set to hang to full length .
The storage container must remain below the level of the filter during filtration .
32 .
Filtration must be initiated up to 8 hours after collection at ambient condition , or up to 3 days at refrigerated temperature .
33 .
Inspect all tubing to ensure it hangs freely without kinks .
34 .
Remove the clamp above the filter to start filtration .
Note : Manual or mechanical pressure should not be used to increase the flow rate through the filter .
Tubing below the filter should not be stripped at any time during the filtration process .
Note : If filtration of red cells is initiated at ambient temperature , the filtration process can be completed at either ambient or refrigerated temperature prior to storing the red cells between 1 and 6 ° C . However , for optimal filtration time , it is recommended to complete the filtration at ambient temperature .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 35 .
When filtration is complete , air can be observed in the inlet side of the filter .
Hermetically seal and detach the tubing below the filter .
36 .
Make segments from the post filter tubing and leave segments attached to the filtered red cell storage container .
( QC samples may be prepared by thoroughly mixing the filtered red cells and stripping this tubing prior to sealing the segments . )
37 .
Store the AS - 1 red blood cells , leukocytes reduced between 1 and 6 ° C . 38 .
Infuse the red cells within 42 days of collection .
39 .
Percent red blood cell recovery should be determined per FDA Guidance entitled " Guidance for Industry – Pre - Storage Leukocyte Reduction of Whole Blood and Blood Components Intended for Transfusion " , current issue .
Warning : Failure to achieve closed system processing conditions negates the extended storage claim and the red blood cell product must be transfused within 24 hours .

Protect from freezing .
Avoid excessive heat .
Definition of " Controlled Room Temperature " : " A temperature maintained thermostatically that encompasses the usual and customary working environment of 20 ° to 25 ° C ( 68 ° to 77 ° F ) ; that results in a mean kinetic temperature calculated to be not more than 25 ° C ; and that allows for excursions between 15 ° C and 30 ° C ( 59 ° and 86 ° F ) that are experienced in pharmacies , hospitals , and warehouses .
Provided the mean kinetic temperature remains in the allowed range , transient spikes up to 40 ° C are permitted as long as they do not exceed 24 hours ... The mean kinetic temperature is a calculated value that may be used as an isothermal storage temperature that simulates the non isothermal effects of storage temperature variations . "
