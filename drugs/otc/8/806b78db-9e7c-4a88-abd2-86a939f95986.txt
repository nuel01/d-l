WARNING : SEVERE TOXIC REACTIONS , INCLUDING EMBRYO - FETAL TOXICITY AND DEATH RediTrex should be used only by physicians whose knowledge and experience include the use of antimetabolite therapy .
Because of the possibility of serious toxic reactions ( which can be fatal ) , RediTrex should be used only in patients with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis with severe , recalcitrant , disabling disease which is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy .
Deaths have been reported with the use of methotrexate in the treatment of malignancy , psoriasis , and rheumatoid arthritis .
Patients should be closely monitored for bone marrow , liver , lung , skin , and kidney toxicities .
Patients should be informed by their physician of the risks involved and be under a physician ' s care throughout therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
1 .
Methotrexate can cause embryo - fetal toxicity , including fetal death .
Use is contraindicated during pregnancy .
Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating therapy .
[ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and after treatment with RediTrex [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , Contraindications ( 4 ) , and Use in Specific populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .
2 .
Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal functions , ascites , or pleural effusions .
Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity , and require dose reduction or , in some cases , discontinuation of RediTrex administration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
3 .
Unexpectedly severe ( sometimes fatal ) bone marrow suppression , aplastic anemia , and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate ( usually in high dosage ) along with some nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
4 .
Methotrexate causes hepatotoxicity , fibrosis and cirrhosis , but generally only after prolonged use .
Acutely , liver enzyme elevations are frequently seen .
These are usually transient and asymptomatic , and also do not appear predictive of subsequent hepatic disease .
Liver biopsy after sustained use often shows histologic changes , and fibrosis and cirrhosis have been reported ; these latter lesions may not be preceded by symptoms or abnormal liver function tests in the psoriasis population .
For this reason , periodic liver biopsies are usually recommended for psoriatic patients who are under long - term treatment .
Persistent abnormalities in liver function tests may precede appearance of fibrosis or cirrhosis in the rheumatoid arthritis population [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
5 .
Methotrexate - induced lung disease , including acute or chronic interstitial pneumonitis , is a potentially dangerous lesion , which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and has been reported at low doses .
It is not always fully reversible and fatalities have been reported .
Pulmonary symptoms ( especially a dry , nonproductive cough ) may require interruption of treatment and careful investigation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
6 .
Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy : otherwise , hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
7 .
Malignant lymphomas , which may regress following withdrawal of methotrexate , may occur in patients receiving low - dose methotrexate and , thus , may not require cytotoxic treatment .
Discontinue RediTrex first and , if the lymphoma does not regress , appropriate treatment should be instituted [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] .
8 .
Like other cytotoxic drugs , methotrexate may induce “ tumor lysis syndrome ” in patients with rapidly growing tumors [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] .
9 .
Severe , occasionally fatal , skin reactions have been reported following single or multiple doses of methotrexate .
Reactions have occurred within days of oral , intramuscular , intravenous , or intrathecal methotrexate administration .
Recovery has been reported with discontinuation of therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
10 .
Potentially fatal opportunistic infections , especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia , may occur with methotrexate therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
11 .
Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 ) ] .

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE RediTrex is a folate analog metabolic inhibitor indicated for the : • Management of patients with severe , active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( pJIA ) , who are intolerant of or had an inadequate response to first - line therapy ( 1 . 1 ) • Symptomatic control of severe , recalcitrant , disabling psoriasis in adults who are not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy ( 1 . 2 ) Limitation of Use RediTrex is not indicated for the treatment of neoplastic diseases ( 1 . 3 ) .
1 . 1 Rheumatoid Arthritis including Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis RediTrex is indicated in the management of selected adults with severe , active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) ( ACR criteria ) , or children with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( pJIA ) , who have had an insufficient therapeutic response to , or are intolerant of , an adequate trial of first - line therapy including full dose non - steroidal anti - inflammatory agents ( NSAIDs ) .
1 . 2 Psoriasis RediTrex is indicated in adults for the symptomatic control of severe , recalcitrant , disabling psoriasis that is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy , but only when the diagnosis has been established , as by biopsy and / or after dermatologic consultation .
It is important to ensure that a psoriasis " flare " is not due to an undiagnosed concomitant disease affecting immune responses .
1 . 3 Limitation of Use RediTrex is not indicated for the treatment of neoplastic diseases .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • RediTrex is for once weekly subcutaneous use only .
Administer RediTrex in the abdomen or thigh .
( 2 . 1 ) • Use another formulation of methotrexate for patients requiring oral , intramuscular , intravenous , intra - arterial , or intrathecal dosing , doses less than 7 . 5 mg per week , doses above 25 mg per week , high - dose regimens , or dose adjustments of less than 2 . 5 mg increments ( 2 . 1 ) • Starting doses of methotrexate : • RA : 7 . 5 mg once weekly ( 2 . 2 ) • pJIA : 10 mg / m2 once weekly ( 2 . 2 ) • Psoriasis : 10 to 25 mg once weekly of an oral , intramuscular , subcutaneous , or intravenous formulation ( 2 . 3 ) • Adjust dose gradually to achieve an optimal response ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 ) 2 . 1 Important Dosing Information RediTrex is a single - dose prefilled syringe ( in a needle safety device ) for once - weekly subcutaneous use only [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Administer RediTrex in the abdomen or the thigh .
RediTrex is available in the following dosage strengths : 7 . 5 , 10 , 12 . 5 , 15 , 17 . 5 , 20 , 22 . 5 and 25 mg .
Use another formulation of methotrexate for alternative dosing in patients who require oral , intramuscular , intravenous , intra - arterial , intrathecal dosing , doses less than 7 . 5 mg per week , doses more than 25 mg per week , high - dose regimens , or dose adjustments of less than 2 . 5 mg increments .
2 . 2 Rheumatoid Arthritis including Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Recommended starting dose of methotrexate : Adult RA : 7 . 5 mg once weekly .
pJIA : 10 mg / m2 once weekly .
For patients switching from oral methotrexate to RediTrex , consider any differences in bioavailability between oral and subcutaneously administered methotrexate [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Dosages may be adjusted gradually to achieve an optimal response .
Limited experience shows a significant increase in the incidence and severity of serious toxic reactions , especially bone marrow suppression , at doses greater than 20 mg / wk in adults .
Although there is experience with doses up to 30 mg / m2 / wk in children , there are too few published data to assess how doses over 20 mg / m2 / wk might affect the risk of serious toxicity in children .
Experience does suggest , however , that children receiving 20 to 30 mg / m2 / wk ( 0 . 65 to 1 . 0 mg / kg / wk ) may have better absorption and fewer gastrointestinal side effects if methotrexate is administered either intramuscularly or subcutaneously .
Therapeutic response usually begins within 3 to 6 weeks and the patient may continue to improve for another 12 weeks or more .
The optimal duration of therapy is unknown .
Limited data available from long - term studies in adults indicate that the initial clinical improvement is maintained for at least two years with continued therapy .
When methotrexate is discontinued , the arthritis usually worsens within 3 to 6 weeks .
The patient should be fully informed of the risks involved and should be under constant supervision of the physician .
Assessment of hematologic , hepatic , renal , and pulmonary function should be made by history , physical examination , and laboratory tests before beginning , periodically during , and before reinstituting RediTrex therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Females of childbearing potential should not be started on RediTrex until pregnancy is excluded [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
All schedules should be continually tailored to the individual patient .
An initial test dose may be given prior to the regular dosing schedule to detect any extreme sensitivity to adverse effects .
Maximal myelosuppression usually occurs in seven to ten days .
2 . 3 Psoriasis Recommended starting dose of methotrexate : Psoriasis : single weekly oral , intramuscular , subcutaneous , or intravenous doses of 10 - 25 mg .
For patients switching from oral methotrexate to RediTrex , consider any differences in bioavailability between oral and subcutaneously administered methotrexate [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Dosage may be gradually adjusted to achieve optimal clinical response ; 30 mg / week should not ordinarily be exceeded .
Once optimal clinical response has been achieved , the dosage should be reduced to the lowest possible amount of drug and to the longest possible rest period .
The use of RediTrex may permit the return to conventional topical therapy , which should be encouraged .
2 . 4 Administration and Handling RediTrex is a prefilled syringe intended for subcutaneous use under the guidance and supervision of a physician .
Patients may self - inject with RediTrex if a physician determines that it is appropriate , if they have received proper training in how to prepare and administer the correct dose , and if they receive medical follow - up , as necessary .
Visually inspect RediTrex for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration .
Handle and dispose of RediTrex consistent with recommendations for handling and disposal of cytotoxic drugs1 .
2 . 5 Pregnancy testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with RediTrex [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS RediTrex contains methotrexate in a sterile , preservative - free , solution in a pre - filled syringe ( in a needle safety device ) with a 29 gauge ½ inch needle for a single subcutaneous injection .
RediTrex solution is yellow in color .
RediTrex is available at a concentration of 25 mg / mL to administer the following doses of methotrexate solution : • 7 . 5 mg • 10 mg • 12 . 5 mg • 15 mg • 17 . 5 mg • 20 mg • 22 . 5 mg • 25 mg Injection : Single - dose pre - filled syringe ( in a needle safety device ) delivering methotrexate in the following dosage strengths : 7 . 5 mg , 10 mg , 12 . 5 mg , 15 mg , 17 . 5 mg , 20 mg , 22 . 5 mg and 25 mg ( 3 ) .
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS RediTrex is contraindicated in the following : • Pregnancy RediTrex can cause embryo - fetal toxicity and fetal death when administered during pregnancy .
[ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
• Alcoholism or Liver Disease Patients with alcoholism , alcoholic liver disease or other chronic liver disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
• Immunodeficiency Syndromes Patients who have overt or laboratory evidence of immunodeficiency syndromes [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
• Preexisting Blood Dyscrasias Patients who have preexisting blood dyscrasias , such as bone marrow hypoplasia , leukopenia , thrombocytopenia , or significant anemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
• Hypersensitivity Patients with a known hypersensitivity to methotrexate .
Severe hypersensitivity reactions have been observed with methotrexate use [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 and 6 . 2 ) ] .
• Pregnancy ( 4 ) • Alcoholism or liver disease ( 4 ) • Immunodeficiency syndromes ( 4 ) • Preexisting blood dyscrasias ( 4 ) • Hypersensitivity to methotrexate ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Organ system toxicity : Potential for serious toxicity .
Only for use by physicians experienced in antimetabolite therapy ( 5 . 1 ) .
• Effects on reproduction : May cause impairment of fertility , oligospermia and menstrual dysfunction ( 5 . 3 ) • Laboratory tests : Monitor complete blood counts , renal function and liver function tests ( 5 . 4 ) .
• Risks from improper dosing : Mistaken daily use has led to fatal toxicity ( 5 . 5 ) • Patients with impaired renal function , ascites , or pleural effusions : Elimination is reduced ( 5 . 6 ) .
• Dizziness and fatigue : May impair ability to drive or operate machinery ( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Organ System Toxicity RediTrex should be used only by physicians whose knowledge and experience include the use of antimetabolite therapy .
Because of the possibility of serious toxic reactions ( which can be fatal ) , RediTrex should be used only in patients with psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis with severe , recalcitrant , disabling disease which is not adequately responsive to other forms of therapy .
Deaths have been reported with the use of methotrexate in the treatment of malignancy , psoriasis , and rheumatoid arthritis .
Patients should be closely monitored for bone marrow , liver , lung and kidney toxicities .
RediTrex has the potential for serious toxicity .
Toxic effects may be related in frequency and severity to dose or frequency of administration but have been seen at all doses .
Because they can occur at any time during therapy , it is necessary to follow patients on RediTrex closely .
Most adverse reactions are reversible if detected early .
When such reactions do occur , the drug should be reduced in dosage or discontinued and appropriate corrective measures should be taken .
If necessary , this could include the use of leucovorin calcium and / or acute , intermittent hemodialysis with a high - flux dialyzer [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
If RediTrex therapy is reinstituted , it should be carried out with caution , with adequate consideration of further need for the drug and increased alertness as to possible recurrence of toxicity .
The clinical pharmacology of methotrexate has not been well studied in older individuals .
Due to diminished hepatic and renal function as well as decreased folate stores in this population , relatively low doses should be considered , and these patients should be closely monitored for early signs of toxicity [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Gastrointestinal : Diarrhea and ulcerative stomatitis require interruption of therapy : otherwise , hemorrhagic enteritis and death from intestinal perforation may occur .
If vomiting , diarrhea , or stomatitis occur , which may result in dehydration , RediTrex should be discontinued until recovery occurs .
RediTrex should be used with extreme caution in the presence of peptic ulcer disease or ulcerative colitis .
Unexpectedly severe ( sometimes fatal ) gastrointestinal toxicity has been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate ( usually in high dosage ) along with some nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Hematologic : RediTrex can suppress hematopoiesis and cause anemia , aplastic anemia , pancytopenia , leukopenia , neutropenia , and / or thrombocytopenia .
In patients with preexisting hematopoietic impairment , RediTrex should be used with caution , if at all .
In controlled clinical trials conducted with another formulation of methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis ( n = 128 ) , leukopenia ( WBC < 3000 / mm3 ) was seen in 2 patients , thrombocytopenia ( platelets < 100 , 000 / mm3 ) in 6 patients , and pancytopenia in 2 patients .
RediTrex should be stopped immediately if there is a significant drop in blood counts .
Patients with profound granulocytopenia and fever should be evaluated immediately and usually require parental broad - spectrum antibiotic therapy .
Unexpectedly severe ( sometimes fatal ) bone marrow suppression and aplastic anemia have been reported with concomitant administration of methotrexate ( usually in high dosage ) along with some nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Hepatic : RediTrex has the potential for acute ( elevated transaminases ) and chronic ( fibrosis and cirrhosis ) hepatotoxicity .
Chronic toxicity is potentially fatal ; it generally has occurred after prolonged use ( generally two years or more ) and after a total dose of at least 1 . 5 grams .
In studies in psoriatic patients , hepatotoxicity appeared to be a function of total cumulative dose and appeared to be enhanced by alcoholism , obesity , diabetes and advanced age .
An accurate incidence rate has not been determined ; the rate of progression and reversibility of lesions is not known .
Special caution is indicated in the presence of preexisting liver damage or impaired hepatic function .
In psoriasis , liver function tests , including serum albumin , should be performed periodically prior to dosing but are often normal in the face of developing fibrosis or cirrhosis .
These lesions may be detectable only by biopsy .
The usual recommendation is to obtain a liver biopsy at 1 ) pretherapy or shortly after initiation of therapy ( 2 to 4 months ) , 2 ) a total cumulative dose of 1 . 5 grams , and 3 ) after each additional 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 grams .
Moderate fibrosis or any cirrhosis normally leads to discontinuation of the drug ; mild fibrosis normally suggests a repeat biopsy in 6 months .
Milder histologic findings such as fatty change and low grade portal inflammation , are relatively common pretherapy .
Although these mild changes are usually not a reason to avoid or discontinue RediTrex therapy , the drug should be used with caution .
In rheumatoid arthritis , age at first use of methotrexate and duration of therapy have been reported as risk factors for hepatotoxicity ; other risk factors , similar to those observed in psoriasis , may be present in rheumatoid arthritis but have not been confirmed to date .
Persistent abnormalities in liver function tests may precede appearance of fibrosis or cirrhosis in this population .
There is a combined reported experience in 217 rheumatoid arthritis patients with liver biopsies both before and during treatment ( after a cumulative dose of at least 1 . 5 g ) and in 714 patients with a biopsy only during treatment .
There are 64 ( 7 % ) cases of fibrosis and 1 ( 0 . 1 % ) case of cirrhosis .
Of the 64 cases of fibrosis , 60 were deemed mild .
The reticulin stain is more sensitive for early fibrosis and its use may increase these figures .
It is unknown whether even longer use will increase these risks .
Liver function tests should be performed at baseline at 4 to 8 week intervals in patients receiving RediTrex for rheumatoid arthritis .
Pretreatment liver biopsy should be performed for patients with a history of excessive alcohol consumption , persistently abnormal baseline liver function test values or chronic hepatitis B or C infection .
During therapy , liver biopsy should be performed if there are persistent liver function test abnormalities or there is a decrease in serum albumin below the normal range ( in the setting of well controlled rheumatoid arthritis ) .
If the results of a liver biopsy show mild changes ( Roenigk , grades I , II , IIIa ) , RediTrex may be continued and the patient monitored as per recommendations listed above .
RediTrex should be discontinued in any patient who displays persistently abnormal liver function tests and refuses liver biopsy or in any patient whose liver biopsy shows moderate to severe changes ( Roenigk grade IIIb or IV ) .
Infection or Immunologic States : RediTrex should be used with extreme caution in the presence of active infection , and is contraindicated in patients with overt or laboratory evidence of immunodeficiency syndromes .
Immunization may be ineffective when given during RediTrex therapy .
Immunization with live virus vaccines is generally not recommended .
There have been reports of disseminated vaccinia infections after smallpox immunizations in patients receiving methotrexate therapy .
Hypogammaglobulinemia has been reported rarely .
Potentially fatal opportunistic infections , especially Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia , may occur with RediTrex therapy .
When a patient presents with pulmonary symptoms , the possibility of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia should be considered .
Neurologic : There have been reports of leukoencephalopathy following intravenous administration of methotrexate to patients who have had craniospinal irradiation .
Serious neurotoxicity , frequently manifested as generalized or focal seizures , has been reported with unexpectedly increased frequency among pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were treated with intermediate - dose intravenous methotrexate ( 1 gm / m2 ) .
Symptomatic patients were commonly noted to have leukoencephalopathy and / or microangiopathic calcifications on diagnostic imaging studies .
Chronic leukoencephalopathy has also been reported in patients who received repeated doses of high - dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue even without cranial irradiation .
Discontinuation of methotrexate does not always result in complete recovery .
A transient acute neurologic syndrome has been observed in patients treated with high dose regimens .
Manifestations of this stroke - like encephalopathy may include confusion , hemiparesis , transient blindness , seizures and coma .
The exact cause is unknown .
After the intrathecal use of methotrexate , the central nervous system toxicity which may occur can be classified as follows : acute chemical arachnoiditis manifested by such symptoms as headache , back pain , nuchal rigidity , and fever ; sub - acute myelopathy characterized by paraparesis / paraplegia associated with involvement with one or more spinal nerve roots ; chronic leukoencephalopathy manifested by confusion , irritability , somnolence , ataxia , dementia , seizures and coma .
This condition can be progressive and even fatal .
Pulmonary : Methotrexate - induced lung disease , including acute or chronic interstitial pneumonitis , is a potentially dangerous lesion , which may occur acutely at any time during therapy and has been reported at low doses .
It is not always fully reversible and fatalities have been reported .
Pulmonary symptoms ( especially a dry nonproductive cough ) or a non - specific pneumonitis occurring during RediTrex therapy may be indicative of a potentially dangerous lesion and require interruption of treatment and careful investigation .
Although clinically variable , the typical patient with methotrexate induced lung disease presents with fever , cough , dyspnea , hypoxemia , and an infiltrate on chest X - ray ; infection ( including pneumonia ) needs to be excluded .
This lesion can occur at all dosages .
Renal : RediTrex may cause renal damage that may lead to acute renal failure .
High doses of methotrexate used in the treatment of osteosarcoma may cause renal damage leading to acute renal failure .
Nephrotoxicity is due primarily to the precipitation of methotrexate and 7 - hydroxymethotrexate in the renal tubules .
Close attention to renal function including adequate hydration , urine alkalinization and measurement of serum methotrexate and creatinine levels are essential for safe administration .
Skin : Severe , occasionally fatal , dermatologic reactions , including toxic epidermal necrolysis , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , exfoliative dermatitis , skin necrosis , and erythema multiforme , have been reported in children and adults , within days of oral , intramuscular , intravenous , or intrathecal methotrexate administration .
Reactions were noted after single or multiple low , intermediate , or high doses of methotrexate in patients with neoplastic and non - neoplastic diseases .
Lesions of psoriasis may be aggravated by concomitant exposure to ultraviolet radiation .
Radiation dermatitis and sunburn may be “ recalled ” by the use of methotrexate .
Other precautions : RediTrex should be used with extreme caution in the presence of debility .
Methotrexate exits slowly from third space compartments ( e . g . , pleural effusions or ascites ) .
This results in a prolonged terminal plasma half - life and unexpected toxicity .
In patients with significant third space accumulations , it is advisable to evacuate the fluid before treatment and to monitor plasma methotrexate levels .
5 . 2 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on published reports and methotrexate ' s mechanism of action , methotrexate can cause embryo - fetal toxicity and fetal death when administered to a pregnant woman .
In pregnant women , methotrexate is contraindicated .
Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating RediTrex .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with RediTrex and for 6 months after the final dose .
Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during RediTrex treatment and for at least 3 months after the final dose [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 3 Effects on Reproduction Based on published reports , methotrexate can cause impairment of fertility , oligospermia and menstrual dysfunction in humans .
It is not known if the infertility is reversible in affected patients .
Discuss the risk of effects on reproduction with female and male patients of reproductive potential [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 4 Laboratory Tests Patients undergoing RediTrex therapy should be closely monitored so that toxic effects are detected promptly .
Baseline assessment should include a complete blood count with differential and platelet counts , hepatic enzymes , renal function tests and a chest X - ray .
During therapy , monitoring of these parameters is recommended : hematology at least monthly , renal function and liver function every 1 to 2 months [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
During initial or changing doses , or during periods of increased risk of elevated methotrexate blood levels ( e . g . , dehydration ) , more frequent monitoring may also be indicated .
Liver Function Tests Transient liver function test abnormalities are observed frequently after methotrexate administration and are usually not cause for modification of methotrexate therapy .
Persistent liver function test abnormalities , and / or depression of serum albumin may be indicators of serious liver toxicity and require evaluation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
A relationship between abnormal liver function tests and fibrosis or cirrhosis of the liver has not been established for patients with psoriasis .
Persistent abnormalities in liver function tests may precede appearance of fibrosis or cirrhosis in the rheumatoid arthritis population .
Pulmonary Function Tests Pulmonary function tests may be useful if methotrexate - induced lung disease is suspected , especially if baseline measurements are available [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 5 Risks from Improper Dosing Both the physician and pharmacist should emphasize to the patient that RediTrex is administered weekly and that mistaken daily use has led to fatal toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
5 . 6 Patients with Impaired Renal Function , Ascites , or Pleural Effusions Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function , ascites , or pleural effusions .
Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity and require dose reduction or , in some cases , discontinuation of RediTrex administration .
5 . 7 Dizziness and Fatigue Adverse reactions , such as dizziness and fatigue , may affect the ability to drive or operate machinery .
5 . 8 Malignant Lymphomas Non - Hodgkin ' s lymphoma and other tumors have been reported in patients receiving low - dose oral methotrexate .
However , there have been instances of malignant lymphoma arising during treatment with low - dose oral methotrexate , which have regressed completely following withdrawal of methotrexate , without requiring active anti - lymphoma treatment .
Discontinue RediTrex first and , if the lymphoma does not regress , appropriate treatment should be instituted .
5 . 9 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Like other cytotoxic drugs , methotrexate may induce “ tumor lysis syndrome ” in patients with rapidly growing tumors .
5 . 10 Concomitant Radiation Therapy Methotrexate given concomitantly with radiotherapy may increase the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience This section provides a summary of adverse reactions reported in subjects in clinical studies conducted with methotrexate injection and oral methotrexate .
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug , and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Rheumatoid Arthritis The approximate incidences of methotrexate - attributed ( i . e . placebo rate subtracted ) adverse reactions in 12 to 18 week double - blind studies of patients ( n = 128 ) with rheumatoid arthritis treated with low - dose oral ( 7 . 5 to 15 mg / week ) pulse methotrexate , are listed below .
Virtually all of these patients were on concomitant nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs and some were also taking low dosages of corticosteroids .
Hepatic histology was not examined in these short - term studies .
Incidence greater than 10 % : Elevated liver function tests 15 % , nausea / vomiting 10 % .
Incidence 3 % to 10 % : Stomatitis , thrombocytopenia ( platelet count less than 100 , 000 / mm3 ) .
Incidence 1 % to 3 % : Rash / pruritus / dermatitis , diarrhea , alopecia , leukopenia ( WBC less than 3000 / mm3 ) , pancytopenia , dizziness .
Two other controlled trials of patients ( n = 680 ) with Rheumatoid Arthritis on 7 . 5 mg to 15 mg / wk oral doses showed an incidence of interstitial pneumonitis of 1 % .
Other less common reactions included decreased hematocrit , headache , upper respiratory infection , anorexia , arthralgias , chest pain , coughing , dysuria , eye discomfort , epistaxis , fever , infection , sweating , tinnitus , and vaginal discharge .
Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis The approximate incidences of adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients with pJIA treated with oral , weekly doses of methotrexate ( 5 to 20 mg / m2 / wk or 0 . 1 to 0 . 65 mg / kg / wk ) were as follows ( virtually all patients were receiving concomitant nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , and some also were taking low doses of corticosteroids ) : elevated liver function tests , 14 % ; gastrointestinal reactions ( e . g . , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ) , 11 % ; stomatitis , 2 % ; leukopenia , 2 % ; headache , 1 . 2 % ; alopecia , 0 . 5 % ; dizziness , 0 . 2 % ; and rash , 0 . 2 % .
Although there is experience with dosing up to 30 mg / m2 / wk in pJIA , the published data for doses above 20 mg / m2 / wk are too limited to provide reliable estimates of adverse reaction rates .
Psoriasis There are two literature reports ( Roenigk , 1969 , and Nyfors , 1978 ) describing large series ( n = 204 , 248 ) of psoriasis patients treated with methotrexate .
Dosages ranged up to 25 mg per week and treatment was administered for up to four years .
With the exception of alopecia , photosensitivity , and “ burning of skin lesions ” ( each 3 % to 10 % ) , the adverse reaction rates in these reports were very similar to those in the rheumatoid arthritis studies .
Rarely , painful plaque erosions may appear ( Pearce , HP and Wilson , BB : Am Acad Dermatol 35 : 835 - 838 , 1996 ) .

Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Aspirin , NSAIDs , and steroids : concomitant use may elevate and prolong serum methotrexate levels and cause increased toxicity ( 7 . 1 ) • Proton pump inhibitors : concomitant use may elevate and prolong serum methotrexate levels and cause increased toxicity ( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Aspirin , Nonsteroidal Anti - Inflammatory Drugs , and Steroids Nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) should not be administered prior to or concomitantly with the high doses of methotrexate , such as used in the treatment of osteosarcoma .
Concomitant administration of some NSAIDs with high dose methotrexate therapy has been reported to elevate and prolong serum methotrexate levels , resulting in deaths from severe hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Caution should be used when NSAIDs and salicylates are administered concomitantly with lower doses of methotrexate , including RediTrex .
These drugs have been reported to reduce the tubular secretion of methotrexate in an animal model and may enhance its toxicity .
Despite the potential interactions , studies of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis have usually included concurrent use of constant dosage regimens of NSAIDs , without apparent problems .
It should be appreciated , however , that the doses used in rheumatoid arthritis ( 7 . 5 to 15 mg / week ) are somewhat lower than those used in psoriasis and that larger doses could lead to unexpected toxicity .
Aspirin , NSAIDs , and / or low dose steroids may be continued , although the possibility of increased toxicity with concomitant use of NSAIDs including salicylates has not been fully explored .
Steroids may be reduced gradually in patients who respond to methotrexate .
7 . 2 Proton Pump Inhibitors ( PPIs ) Use caution if high - dose methotrexate is administered to patients receiving proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) therapy .
Case reports and published population pharmacokinetic studies suggest that concomitant use of some PPIs , such as omeprazole , esomeprazole , and pantoprazole , with methotrexate ( primarily at high dose ) , may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and / or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate , possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities .
In two of these cases , delayed methotrexate elimination was observed when high - dose methotrexate was co - administered with PPIs , but was not observed when methotrexate was co - administered with ranitidine .
However , no formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with ranitidine have been conducted .
7 . 3 Oral Antibiotics Oral antibiotics such as tetracycline , chloramphenicol , and nonabsorbable broad spectrum antibiotics , may decrease intestinal absorption of methotrexate or interfere with the enterohepatic circulation by inhibiting bowel flora and suppressing metabolism of the drug by bacteria .
Penicillins may reduce the renal clearance of methotrexate ; increased serum concentrations of methotrexate with concomitant hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity have been observed with high and low dose methotrexate .
Use of RediTrex with penicillins should be carefully monitored .
Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole has been reported rarely to increase bone marrow suppression in patients receiving methotrexate , probably by decreased tubular secretion and / or an additive antifolate effect .
7 . 4 Hepatotoxins The potential for increased hepatotoxicity when methotrexate is administered with other hepatotoxic agents has not been evaluated .
However , hepatotoxicity has been reported in such cases .
Therefore , patients receiving concomitant therapy with RediTrex and other potential hepatotoxins ( e . g . , azathioprine , retinoids , and sulfasalazine ) should be closely monitored for possible increased risk of hepatotoxicity .
7 . 5 Theophylline Methotrexate may decrease the clearance of theophylline ; theophylline levels should be monitored when used concurrently with RediTrex .
7 . 6 Folic Acid and Antifolates Vitamin preparations containing folic acid or its derivatives may decrease responses to systemically administered methotrexate .
Preliminary animal and human studies have shown that small quantities of intravenously administered leucovorin enter the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) primarily as 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate and , in humans , remain 1 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than the usual methotrexate concentrations following intrathecal administration .
However , high doses of leucovorin may reduce the efficacy of intrathecally administered methotrexate .
Folate deficiency states may increase methotrexate toxicity .
Trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole has been reported rarely to increase bone marrow suppression in patients receiving methotrexate , probably by decreased tubular secretion and / or an additive antifolate effect .
7 . 7 Mercaptopurine Methotrexate increases the plasma levels of mercaptopurine .
The combination of RediTrex and mercaptopurine may therefore require dose adjustment .
7 . 8 Nitrous Oxide The use of nitrous oxide anesthesia potentiates the effect of methotrexate on folate dependent metabolic pathways , resulting in the potential for increased toxicity .
Avoid concomitant nitrous oxide anesthesia in patients receiving methotrexate .
7 . 9 Other Drugs Methotrexate is partially bound to serum albumin , and toxicity may be increased because of displacement by certain drugs , such as salicylates , phenylbutazone , phenytoin , and sulfonamides .
Renal tubular transport is also diminished by probenecid ; use of RediTrex with this drug should be carefully monitored .
Combined use of methotrexate with gold , penicillamine , hydroxychloroquine , sulfasalazine , or cytotoxic agents , has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric use : Safety and efficacy of methotrexate , including RediTrex , have not been established in pediatric patients with psoriasis .
Safety and efficacy of RediTrex have not been established in pediatric patients with malignancy ( 8 . 4 ) • Geriatric use : Use caution in dose selection ( 8 . 5 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on published reports and methotrexate ' s mechanism of action , methotrexate can cause embryo - fetal toxicity and fetal death when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Data and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
In pregnant women with non - malignant disease , RediTrex is contraindicated .
There are no animal data that meet current standards for nonclinical developmental toxicity studies .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data Published data from cases , literature reviews , and observational studies report that methotrexate exposure during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of embryo - fetal toxicity and fetal death .
Methotrexate exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased incidence of spontaneous abortions and multiple adverse developmental outcomes , including skull anomalies , facial dysmorphism , central nervous system abnormalities , limb abnormalities , and sometimes cardiac anomalies and intellectual impairment .
Adverse outcomes associated with exposure during second and third trimesters of pregnancy include intrauterine growth restriction and functional abnormalities .
Because methotrexate is widely distributed and persists in the body for a prolonged period , there is a potential risk to the fetus from preconception methotrexate exposure .
A prospective multicenter study evaluated pregnancy outcomes in women taking methotrexate less than or equal to 30 mg / week after conception .
The rate of miscarriage in pregnant women exposed to methotrexate was 42 . 5 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ 95 % CI ] 29 . 2 - 58 . 7 ) , which was higher than in unexposed autoimmune disease comparators ( 22 . 5 % , 95 % CI 16 . 8 - 29 . 7 ) and unexposed nonautoimmune disease ( 17 . 3 % , 95 % CI 13 - 22 . 8 ) .
Of the live births , the rate of major birth defects in pregnant women exposed to methotrexate after conception was higher than in autoimmune disease ( adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) 1 . 8 [ 95 % CI 0 . 6 - 5 . 7 ] ) and nonautoimmune disease ( adjusted OR 3 . 1 [ 95 % CI 1 . 03 - 9 . 5 ] ) .
Major birth defects associated with pregnancies exposed to methotrexate after conception were not always consistent with methotrexate - associated adverse developmental outcomes .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published literature report the presence of methotrexate in human milk in low amounts .
The highest breast milk to plasma concentration ratio demonstrated was 0 . 08 : 1 .
No information is available on the effects of methotrexate on a breastfed infant or on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions , including myelosuppression , from methotrexate in breastfed infants , advise women not to breastfeed during RediTrex therapy and for one week after final dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating RediTrex .
Contraception Females RediTrex can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for 6 months after the final dose of RediTrex .
Males Methotrexate can cause chromosomal damage to sperm cells .
Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for at least 3 months after the final dose of RediTrex .
Infertility Females Based on published reports of female infertility after treatment with methotrexate , advise females of reproductive potential that RediTrex can cause impairment of fertility and menstrual dysfunction during and after cessation of therapy .
It is not known if the infertility may be reversed in all affected females .
Males Based on published reports of male infertility after treatment with methotrexate , advise males of reproductive potential that RediTrex can cause oligospermia or infertility during and after cessation of therapy .
It is not known if the infertility may be reversed in all affected males .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of methotrexate , including RediTrex , have not been established in pediatric patients with psoriasis .
The safety and effectiveness of RediTrex have not been established in pediatric patients with neoplastic diseases .
The safety and effectiveness of methotrexate have been established in pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Published clinical studies evaluating the use of methotrexate in children and adolescents ( i . e . , patients 2 to 16 years of age ) with pJIA demonstrated safety comparable to that observed in adults with rheumatoid arthritis [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
RediTrex does not contain a preservative .
However , methotrexate injectable formulations containing the preservative benzyl alcohol are not recommended for use in neonates .
There have been reports of fatal ‘ gasping syndrome ' in neonates ( children less than one month of age ) following the administrations of intravenous solutions containing the preservative benzyl alcohol .
Symptoms include a striking onset of gasping respiration , hypotension , bradycardia , and cardiovascular collapse .
Serious neurotoxicity , frequently manifested as generalized or focal seizures , has been reported with unexpectedly increased frequency among pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were treated with intermediate - dose intravenous methotrexate ( 1 gm / m2 ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of methotrexate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic and renal function , decreased folate stores , concomitant disease or other drug therapy ( i . e . , that interfere with renal function , methotrexate or folate metabolism ) in this population [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) Drug Interactions ( 7 . 7 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Since decline in renal function may be associated with increases in adverse reactions and serum creatinine measurements may over estimate renal function in the elderly , more accurate methods ( i . e . , creatinine clearance ) should be considered .
Serum methotrexate levels may also be helpful .
Elderly patients should be closely monitored for early signs of hepatic , bone marrow and renal toxicity .
In chronic use situations , certain toxicities may be reduced by folate supplementation .
Post - marketing experience suggests that the occurrence of bone marrow suppression , thrombocytopenia , and pneumonitis may increase with age [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Methotrexate elimination is reduced in patients with impaired renal function .
Such patients require especially careful monitoring for toxicity and require dose reduction or , in some cases , discontinuation of RediTrex administration .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on methotrexate pharmacokinetics has not been studied .
RediTrex is contraindicated in patients with alcoholic liver disease or other chronic liver disease .
Patients with obesity , diabetes , hepatic fibrosis or steatohepatitis are at increased risk for hepatic injury and fibrosis secondary to methotrexate , and should be monitored closely [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Leucovorin is indicated to diminish the toxicity and counteract the effect of inadvertently administered overdosages of methotrexate .
Leucovorin administration should begin as promptly as possible .
As the time interval between methotrexate administration and leucovorin initiation increases , the effectiveness of leucovorin in counteracting toxicity decreases .
Monitoring of the serum methotrexate concentration is essential in determining the optimal dose and duration of treatment with leucovorin .
In cases of massive overdosage , hydration and urinary alkalinization may be necessary to prevent the precipitation of methotrexate and / or its metabolites in the renal tubules .
Generally speaking , neither hemodialysis nor peritoneal dialysis has been shown to improve methotrexate elimination .
However , effective clearance of methotrexate has been reported with acute , intermittent hemodialysis using a high - flux dialyzer ( Wall , SM et al : Am J Kidney Dis 28 ( 10 ) : 846 - 854 , 1996 ) .
Accidental intrathecal overdosage may require intensive systemic support , high - dose systemic leucovorin , alkaline diuresis and rapid CSF drainage and ventriculolumbar perfusion .
In postmarketing experience , overdose with methotrexate has generally occurred with oral and intrathecal administration , although intravenous and intramuscular overdose have also been reported .
Reports of oral overdose often indicate accidental daily administration instead of weekly ( single or divided doses ) .
Symptoms commonly reported following oral overdose include those symptoms and signs reported at pharmacologic doses , particularly hematologic and gastrointestinal reaction .
For example , leukopenia , thrombocytopenia , anemia , pancytopenia , bone marrow suppression , mucositis , stomatitis , oral ulceration , nausea , vomiting , gastrointestinal ulceration , gastrointestinal bleeding .
In some cases , no symptoms were reported .
There have been reports of death following overdose .
In these cases , events such as sepsis or septic shock , renal failure , and aplastic anemia were also reported .
Symptoms of intrathecal overdose are generally central nervous system ( CNS ) symptoms , including headache , nausea and vomiting , seizure or convulsion , and acute toxic encephalopathy .
In some cases , no symptoms were reported .
There have been reports of death following intrathecal overdose .
In these cases , cerebellar herniation associated with increased intracranial pressure , and acute toxic encephalopathy have also been reported .
There are published case reports of intravenous and intrathecal carboxypeptidase G2 treatment to hasten clearance of methotrexate in cases of overdose .
11 DESCRIPTION RediTrex contains methotrexate , a folate analog metabolic inhibitor .
Chemically , methotrexate is [ N - [ 4 - [ [ ( 2 , 4 - diamino - 6 - pteridinyl ) methyl ] methylamino ] benzoyl ] - Lglutamic acid .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] C20H22N8O5 M . W . = 454 . 45 RediTrex contains methotrexate in a sterile , preservative - free , solution in a pre - filled syringe ( in a needle safety device ) with a 29 gauge ½ inch needle for a single subcutaneous injection .
RediTrex solution is yellow in color .
Inactive ingredients include sodium chloride , sodium hydroxide and water for injection , USP .
Sodium chloride is added to adjust tonicity .
Sodium hydroxide is added to adjust pH to a target pH of 8 . 2 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolic acid reductase .
Dihydrofolates must be reduced to tetrahydrofolates by this enzyme before they can be utilized as carriers of one - carbon groups in the synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate .
Therefore , methotrexate interferes with DNA synthesis , repair , and cellular replication .
Actively proliferating tissues such as malignant cells , bone marrow , fetal cells , buccal and intestinal mucosa , and cells of the urinary bladder are in general more sensitive to this effect of methotrexate .
The mechanism of action in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown ; it may affect immune function .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Two reports describe in vitro methotrexate inhibition of DNA precursor uptake by stimulated mononuclear cells , and another describes in animal polyarthritis partial correction by methotrexate of spleen cell hyporesponsiveness and suppressed IL 2 production .
Other laboratories , however , have been unable to demonstrate similar effects .
Clarification of methotrexate ' s effect on immune activity and its relation to rheumatoid immunopathogenesis await further studies .
In psoriasis , the rate of production of epithelial cells in the skin is greatly increased over normal skin .
This differential in proliferation rates is the basis for the use of methotrexate to control the psoriatic process .
Methotrexate in high doses , followed by leucovorin rescue , is used as a part of the treatment of patients with non - metastatic osteosarcoma .
The original rationale for high dose methotrexate therapy was based on the concept of selective rescue of normal tissues by leucovorin .
More recent evidence suggests that high dose methotrexate may also overcome methotrexate resistance caused by impaired active transport , decreased affinity of dihydrofolic acid reductase for methotrexate , increased levels of dihydrofolic acid reductase resulting from gene amplification , or decreased polyglutamation of methotrexate .
The actual mechanism of action is unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In adults , oral absorption appears to be dose dependent .
Peak serum levels are reached within one to two hours .
At doses of 30 mg / m2 or less , methotrexate is generally well absorbed with a mean bioavailability of about 60 % .
The absorption of doses greater than 80 mg / m2 is significantly less , possibly due to a saturation effect .
In relative bioavailability studies in rheumatoid arthritis patients , systemic exposure of methotrexate was found to be similar between a methotrexate injection prefilled syringe and intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of methotrexate injection at the same doses , however systemic exposure of methotrexate was higher with a methotrexate injection prefilled syringe as compared to oral administration of methotrexate at the same dose .
Bioavailability following oral dosing showed a plateau effect at doses of 15 mg and greater .
The systemic exposure of methotrexate from a methotrexate injection prefilled syringe at doses of 10 , 15 , 20 , and 25 mg was higher than that of oral methotrexate by 17 , 13 , 31 , and 36 % , respectively .
Methotrexate systemic absorption from a methotrexate injection prefilled syringe was similar when administered into the abdomen or thigh .
In leukemic pediatric patients , oral absorption of methotrexate also appears to be dose dependent and has been reported to vary widely ( 23 % to 95 % ) .
A twenty fold difference between highest and lowest peak levels ( Cmax : 0 . 11 to 2 . 3 micromolar after a 20 mg / m2 dose ) has been reported .
Significant interindividual variability has also been noted in time to peak concentration ( Tmax : 0 . 67 to 4 hrs after a 15 mg / m2 dose ) and fraction of dose absorbed .
The absorption of doses greater than 40 mg / m2 has been reported to be significantly less than that of lower doses .
Food has been shown to delay absorption and reduce peak concentration .
Methotrexate is generally completely absorbed from parenteral routes of injection .
After intramuscular injection , peak serum concentrations occur in 30 to 60 minutes .
As in leukemic pediatric patients , a wide interindividual variability in the plasma concentrations of methotrexate has been reported in pediatric patients with JIA .
Following oral administration of methotrexate in doses of 6 . 4 to 11 . 2 mg / m2 / week in pediatric patients with JIA , mean serum concentrations were 0 . 59 micromolar ( range , 0 . 03 to 1 . 40 ) at 1 hour , 0 . 44 micromolar ( range , 0 . 01 to 1 . 00 ) at 2 hours , and 0 . 29 micromolar ( range , 0 . 06 to 0 . 58 ) at 3 hours .
Distribution After intravenous administration , the initial volume of distribution is approximately 0 . 18 L / kg ( 18 % of body weight ) and steady - state volume of distribution is approximately 0 . 4 to 0 . 8 L / kg ( 40 to 80 % of body weight ) .
Methotrexate competes with reduced folates for active transport across cell membranes by means of a single carrier - mediated active transport process .
At serum concentrations greater than 100 micromolar , passive diffusion becomes a major pathway by which effective intracellular concentrations can be achieved .
Methotrexate in serum is approximately 50 % protein bound .
Laboratory studies demonstrate that it may be displaced from plasma albumin by various compounds including sulfonamides , salicylates , tetracyclines , chloramphenicol , and phenytoin .
Methotrexate does not penetrate the blood - cerebrospinal fluid barrier in therapeutic amounts when given orally or parenterally .
High CSF concentrations of the drug may be attained by intrathecal administration of other parenteral forms of methotrexate .
In dogs , synovial fluid concentrations after oral dosing were higher in inflamed than uninflamed joints .
Although salicylates did not interfere with this penetration , prior prednisone treatment reduced penetration into inflamed joints to the level of normal joints .
Metabolism After absorption , methotrexate undergoes hepatic and intracellular metabolism to polyglutamated forms which can be converted back to methotrexate by hydrolase enzymes .
These polyglutamates act as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthetase .
Small amounts of methotrexate polyglutamates may remain in tissues for extended periods .
The retention and prolonged drug action of these active metabolites vary among different cells , tissues and tumors .
A small amount of metabolism to 7 - hydroxymethotrexate may occur at doses commonly prescribed .
Accumulation of this metabolite may become significant at the high doses used in osteogenic sarcoma .
The aqueous solubility of 7 - hydroxymethotrexate is 3 to 5 fold lower than the parent compound .
Methotrexate is partially metabolized by intestinal flora after oral administration .
Half - Life The terminal half - life reported for methotrexate is approximately three to ten hours for patients receiving treatment for psoriasis , or rheumatoid arthritis or low dose antineoplastic therapy ( less than 30 mg / m2 ) .
For patients receiving high doses of methotrexate , the terminal half - life is eight to 15 hours .
In pediatric patients receiving methotrexate for acute lymphocytic leukemia ( 6 . 3 to 30 mg / m2 ) , or for JIA ( 3 . 75 to 26 . 2 mg / m2 ) , the terminal half - life has been reported to range from 0 . 7 to 5 . 8 hours or 0 . 9 to 2 . 3 hours , respectively .
Excretion Renal excretion is the primary route of elimination and is dependent upon dosage and route of administration .
With IV administration , 80 % to 90 % of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours .
There is limited biliary excretion amounting to 10 % or less of the administered dose .
Enterohepatic recirculation of methotrexate has been proposed .
Renal excretion occurs by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion .
Nonlinear elimination due to saturation of renal tubular reabsorption has been observed in psoriatic patients at doses between 7 . 5 and 30 mg .
Impaired renal function , as well as concurrent use of drugs such as weak organic acids that also undergo tubular secretion , can markedly increase methotrexate serum levels .
Excellent correlation has been reported between methotrexate clearance and endogenous creatinine clearance .
Methotrexate clearance rates vary widely and are generally decreased at higher doses .
Delayed drug clearance has been identified as one of the major factors responsible for methotrexate toxicity .
It has been postulated that the toxicity of methotrexate for normal tissues is more dependent upon the duration of exposure to the drug rather than the peak level achieved .
When a patient has delayed drug elimination due to compromised renal function , a third space effusion , or other causes , methotrexate serum concentrations may remain elevated for prolonged periods .
When other forms of parenteral methotrexate are administered during cancer chemotherapy , the potential for toxicity from high dose regimens or delayed excretion is reduced by the administration of leucovorin calcium during the final phase of methotrexate plasma elimination .
Pharmacokinetic monitoring of methotrexate serum concentrations may help identify those patients at high risk for methotrexate toxicity and aid in proper adjustments of leucovorin dosing .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Methotrexate has been evaluated in a number of animal studies for carcinogenic potential with inconclusive results .
Although there is evidence that methotrexate causes chromosomal damage to animal somatic cells and human bone marrow cells , the clinical significance remains uncertain .
Data are available regarding the risks for pregnancy and for fertility in humans [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 and 8 . 6 ) ] .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical trials in patients with rheumatoid arthritis were performed using other formulations of methotrexate .
In patients with rheumatoid arthritis , effects of methotrexate on articular swelling and tenderness can be seen as early as 3 to 6 weeks .
Most studies of methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are relatively short term ( 3 to 6 months ) .
Limited data from long - term studies indicate that an initial clinical improvement is maintained for at least two years with continued therapy .
14 . 2 Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Clinical trials in patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis were performed using other formulations of methotrexate .
In a 6 - month double - blind , placebo - controlled trial of 127 pediatric patients with pJIA ( mean age , 10 . 1 years ; age range , 2 . 5 to 18 years ; mean duration of disease , 5 . 1 years ) on background nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs and / or prednisone , methotrexate given weekly at an oral dose of 10 mg / m2 provided significant clinical improvement compared to placebo as measured by either the physician ' s global assessment , or by a patient composite ( 25 % reduction in the articular - severity score plus improvement in parent and physician global assessments of disease activity ) .
Over two - thirds of the patients in this trial had polyarticular - course JIA , and the numerically greatest response was seen in this subgroup treated with 10 mg / m2 / wk methotrexate .
The overwhelming majority of the remaining patients had systemic - course JIA .
All patients were unresponsive to NSAIDs ; approximately one - third were using low dose corticosteroids .
Weekly methotrexate at a dose of 5 mg / m2 was not significantly more effective than placebo in this trial .
