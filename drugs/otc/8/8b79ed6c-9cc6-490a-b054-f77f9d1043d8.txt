[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] DESCRIPTION : BSS PLUS ™ is a sterile intraocular irrigating solution for use during all intraocular surgical procedures , including those requiring a relatively long intraocular perfusion time ( e . g . , pars plana vitrectomy , phacoemulsification , extracapsular cataract extraction / lens aspiration , anterior segment reconstruction , etc . ) .
The solution does not contain a preservative and should be prepared just prior to use in surgery .
Part I : Part I is a sterile 480 mL solution in a 500 mL single - dose bottle to which the Part II concentrate is added .
Each mL of Part I contains : sodium chloride 7 . 44 mg , potassium chloride 0 . 395 mg , dibasic sodium phosphate 0 . 433 mg , sodium bicarbonate 2 . 19 mg , hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide ( to adjust pH ) , in water for injection .
Part II : Part II is a sterile concentrate in a 20 mL single - dose vial for addition to Part I . Each mL of Part II contains : calcium chloride dihydrate 3 . 85 mg , magnesium chloride hexahydrate 5 mg , dextrose 23 mg , glutathione disulfide ( oxidized glutathione ) 4 . 6 mg , in water for injection .
After addition of BSS PLUS Part II to the Part I bottle , each mL of the reconstituted product contains : sodium chloride 7 . 14 mg , potassium chloride 0 . 38 mg , calcium chloride dihydrate 0 . 154 mg , magnesium chloride hexahydrate 0 . 2 mg , dibasic sodium phosphate 0 . 42 mg , sodium bicarbonate 2 . 1 mg , dextrose 0 . 92 mg , glutathione disulfide ( oxidized glutathione ) 0 . 184 mg , hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide ( to adjust pH ) , in water for injection .
The reconstituted product has a pH of approximately 7 . 4 .
Osmolality is approximately 305 mOsm .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : None of the components of BSS PLUS are foreign to the eye , and BSS PLUS has no pharmacological action .
Human perfused cornea studies have shown BSS PLUS to be an effective irrigation solution for providing corneal detumescence and maintaining corneal endothelial integrity during intraocular perfusion .
An in vivo study in rabbits has shown that BSS PLUS is more suitable than normal saline or Balanced Salt Solution for intravitreal irrigation because BSS PLUS contains the appropriate bicarbonate , pH , and ionic composition necessary for the maintenance of normal retinal electrical activity .
Human in vivo studies have demonstrated BSS PLUS to be safe and effective when used during surgical procedures such as pars plana vitrectomy , phacoemulsification , cataract extraction / lens aspiration , anterior segment reconstruction .
No differences have been observed between adults and pediatric patients following use of this drug product .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE : BSS PLUS is indicated for use as an intraocular irrigating solution during intraocular surgical procedures involving perfusion of the eye .
CONTRAINDICATIONS : There are no specific contraindications to the use of BSS PLUS ; however , contraindications for the surgical procedure during which BSS PLUS is to be used should be strictly adhered to .
WARNINGS : For IRRIGATION during ophthalmic surgery only .
Not for injection or intravenous infusion .
Do not use unless product is clear , seal is intact , vacuum is present and container is undamaged .
Do not use if product is discolored or contains a precipitate .
PRECAUTIONS : DO NOT USE BSS PLUS UNTIL PART I IS FULLY RECONSTITUTED WITH PART II .
Discard unused contents .
BSS PLUS does not contain a preservative ; therefore , do not use this container for more than one patient .
DISCARD ANY UNUSED PORTION SIX HOURS AFTER PREPARATION .
Studies suggest that intraocular irrigating solutions which are iso - osmotic with normal aqueous fluids should be used with caution in diabetic patients undergoing vitrectomy since intraoperative lens changes have been observed .
There have been reports of corneal clouding or edema following ocular surgery in which BSS PLUS was used as an irrigating solution .
As in all surgical procedures appropriate measures should be taken to minimize trauma to the cornea and other ocular tissues .
Preparation : Reconstitute BSS PLUS ™ Intraocular Irrigating Solution just prior to use in surgery .
Follow the same strict aseptic procedures in the reconstitution of BSS PLUS as is used for intravenous additives .
Remove the blue flip - off seal from the BSS PLUS Part I ( 480 mL ) bottle .
Remove the blue flip - off seal from the BSS PLUS Part II ( 20 mL ) vial .
Clean and disinfect the rubber stoppers on both containers by using sterile alcohol wipes .
Transfer the contents of the Part II vial to the Part I bottle using a BSS PLUS Vacuum Transfer Device ( provided ) .
An alternative method of solution transfer may be accomplished by using a 20 mL syringe to remove the Part II solution from the vial and transferring exactly 20 mL to the Part I container through the outer target area of the rubber stopper .
An excess volume of Part II is provided in each vial .
Gently agitate the contents to mix the solution .
Place a sterile cap on the bottle .
Remove the tear - off portion of the label .
Record the time and date of reconstitution and the patient ' s name on the bottle label .
Geriatric Use : No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients .
ADVERSE REACTIONS : Postoperative inflammatory reactions as well as incidents of corneal edema and corneal decompensation have been reported .
Their relationship to the use of BSS PLUS has not been established .
OVERDOSAGE : The solution has no pharmacological action and thus no potential for overdosage .
However , as with any intraocular surgical procedure , the duration of intraocular manipulation should be kept to a minimum .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : The solution should be used according to the standard technique employed by the operating surgeon .
Use an administration set with an air - inlet in the plastic spike since the bottle does not contain a separate airway tube .
Follow the directions for the particular administration set to be used .
Insert the spike aseptically into the bottle through the center target area of the rubber stopper .
Allow the fluid to flow to remove air from the tubing before intraocular irrigation begins .
If a second bottle is necessary to complete the surgical procedure , ensure that the vacuum is vented from the second bottle BEFORE attachment to the administration set .
HOW SUPPLIED : BSS PLUS is supplied in two packages for reconstitution prior to use : a 500 mL glass bottle containing 480 mL ( Part I ) and a 20 mL glass vial ( Part II ) ; both using grey butyl stoppers and aluminum seals with polypropylene flip - off caps .
See the PRECAUTIONS section regarding reconstitution of the solution .
NDC 0065 - 0800 - 50 .
Storage : Store Part I and Part II at 2 ° - 25 ° C ( 36 ° - 77 ° F ) .
Discard prepared solution after six hours .

• Fluid will automatically transfer from the vial into the large vacuum bottle unless filter becomes occluded or loss of vacuum occurs .
NOTE : An excess amount of BSS PLUS Part II is provided in each vial .
A non - transferred solution residual of approximately 0 . 3 mL can be expected to remain in the vial .
• Immediately remove needle from the BSS PLUS Part I container and discard it after solution transfer has been completed .
• Place a sterile safety cap over the rubber stopper of Part I if the solution is not going to be used immediately .
Mix the solution gently until uniform .
Peel off the right - hand side of Part I bottle label ( fully reconstituted BSS PLUS Solution ) .
