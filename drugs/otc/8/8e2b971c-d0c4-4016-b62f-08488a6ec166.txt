ADVERSE REACTIONS Lisinopril has been found to be generally well tolerated in controlled clinical trials involving 1969 patients with hypertension or heart failure .
For the most part , adverse experiences were mild and transient .
Hypertension In clinical trials in patients with hypertension treated with lisinopril , discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse experiences occurred in 5 . 7 % of patients .
The overall frequency of adverse experiences could not be related to total daily dosage within the recommended therapeutic dosage range .
For adverse experiences occurring in greater than 1 % of patients with hypertension treated with lisinopril or lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide in controlled clinical trials , and more frequently with lisinopril and / or lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide than placebo , comparative incidence data are listed in the table below : PERCENT OF PATIENTS IN CONTROLLED STUDIES Lisinopril ( n = 1349 ) Incidence ( discontinuation ) Lisinopril / Hydrochlorothiazide ( n = 629 ) Incidence ( discontinuation ) Placebo ( n = 207 ) Incidence ( discontinuation ) Body as a Whole Fatigue 2 . 5 ( 0 . 3 ) 4 . 0 ( 0 . 5 ) 1 . 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Asthenia 1 . 3 ( 0 . 5 ) 2 . 1 ( 0 . 2 ) 1 . 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Orthostatic Effects 1 . 2 ( 0 . 0 ) 3 . 5 ( 0 . 2 ) 1 . 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Cardiovascular Hypotension 1 . 2 ( 0 . 5 ) 1 . 6 ( 0 . 5 ) 0 . 5 ( 0 . 5 ) Digestive Diarrhea 2 . 7 ( 0 . 2 ) 2 . 7 ( 0 . 3 ) 2 . 4 ( 0 . 0 ) Nausea 2 . 0 ( 0 . 4 ) 2 . 5 ( 0 . 2 ) 2 . 4 ( 0 . 0 ) Vomiting 1 . 1 ( 0 . 2 ) 1 . 4 ( 0 . 1 ) 0 . 5 ( 0 . 0 ) Dyspepsia 0 . 9 ( 0 . 0 ) 1 . 9 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 . 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Musculoskeletal Muscle Cramps 0 . 5 ( 0 . 0 ) 2 . 9 ( 0 . 8 ) 0 . 5 ( 0 . 0 ) Nervous / Psychiatric Headache 5 . 7 ( 0 . 2 ) 4 . 5 ( 0 . 5 ) 1 . 9 ( 0 . 0 ) Dizziness 5 . 4 ( 0 . 4 ) 9 . 2 ( 1 . 0 ) 1 . 9 ( 0 . 0 ) Paresthesia 0 . 8 ( 0 . 1 ) 2 . 1 ( 0 . 2 ) 0 . 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Decreased Libido 0 . 4 ( 0 . 1 ) 1 . 3 ( 0 . 1 ) 0 . 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Vertigo 0 . 2 ( 0 . 1 ) 1 . 1 ( 0 . 2 ) 0 . 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Respiratory Cough 3 . 5 ( 0 . 7 ) 4 . 6 ( 0 . 8 ) 1 . 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Upper Respiratory Infection 2 . 1 ( 0 . 1 ) 2 . 7 ( 0 . 1 ) 0 . 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Common Cold 1 . 1 ( 0 . 1 ) 1 . 3 ( 0 . 1 ) 0 . 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Nasal Congestion 0 . 4 ( 0 . 1 ) 1 . 3 ( 0 . 1 ) 0 . 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Influenza 0 . 3 ( 0 . 1 ) 1 . 1 ( 0 . 1 ) 0 . 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Skin Rash 1 . 3 ( 0 . 4 ) 1 . 6 ( 0 . 2 ) 0 . 5 ( 0 . 5 ) Urogenital Impotence 1 . 0 ( 0 . 4 ) 1 . 6 ( 0 . 5 ) 0 . 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Chest pain and back pain were also seen , but were more common on placebo than lisinopril .
Heart Failure In patients with heart failure treated with lisinopril for up to four years , discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse experiences occurred in 11 % of patients .
In controlled studies in patients with heart failure , therapy was discontinued in 8 . 1 % of patients treated with lisinopril for 12 weeks , compared to 7 . 7 % of patients treated with placebo for 12 weeks .
The following table lists those adverse experiences which occurred in greater than 1 % of patients with heart failure treated with lisinopril or placebo for up to 12 weeks in controlled clinical trials , and more frequently on lisinopril than placebo .
Controlled Trials Controlled Trials Lisinopril ( n = 407 ) Incidence ( discontinuation ) 12 weeks Placebo ( n = 155 ) Incidence ( discontinuation ) 12 weeks Body as a Whole Chest Pain 3 . 4 ( 0 . 2 ) 1 . 3 ( 0 . 0 ) Abdominal Pain 2 . 2 ( 0 . 7 ) 1 . 9 ( 0 . 0 ) Cardiovascular Hypotension 4 . 4 ( 1 . 7 ) 0 . 6 ( 0 . 6 ) Digestive Diarrhea 3 . 7 ( 0 . 5 ) 1 . 9 ( 0 . 0 ) Nervous / Psychiatric Dizziness 11 . 8 ( 1 . 2 ) 4 . 5 ( 1 . 3 ) Headache 4 . 4 ( 0 . 2 ) 3 . 9 ( 0 . 0 ) Respiratory Upper Respiratory Infection 1 . 5 ( 0 . 0 ) 1 . 3 ( 0 . 0 ) Skin Rash 1 . 7 ( 0 . 5 ) 0 . 6 ( 0 . 6 ) Also observed at > 1 % with lisinopril but more frequent or as frequent on placebo than lisinopril in controlled trials were asthenia , angina pectoris , nausea , dyspnea , cough , and pruritus .
Worsening of heart failure , anorexia , increased salivation , muscle cramps , back pain , myalgia , depression , chest sound abnormalities , and pulmonary edema were also seen in controlled clinical trials , but were more common on placebo than lisinopril .
In the two - dose ATLAS trial in heart failure patients , withdrawals due to adverse events were not different between the low and high groups , either in total number of discontinuation ( 17 - 18 % ) or in rare specific events ( less than 1 % ) .
The following adverse events , mostly related to ACE inhibition , were reported more commonly in the high dose group : % of patients Events High Dose ( N = 1568 ) Low Dose ( N = 1596 ) Dizziness 18 . 9 12 . 1 Hypotension 10 . 8 6 . 7 Creatinine - increased 9 . 9 7 . 0 Hyperkalemia 6 . 4 3 . 5 NPN * increased 9 . 2 6 . 5 Syncope 7 . 0 5 . 1 * NPN = non - protein nitrogen Acute Myocardial Infarction In the GISSI - 3 trial , in patients treated with lisinopril for six weeks following acute myocardial infarction , discontinuation of therapy occurred in 17 . 6 % of patients .
Patients treated with lisinopril had a significantly higher incidence of hypotension and renal dysfunction compared with patients not taking lisinopril .
In the GISSI - 3 trial , hypotension ( 9 . 7 % ) , renal dysfunction ( 2 % ) , cough ( 0 . 5 % ) , post infarction angina ( 0 . 3 % ) , skin rash and generalized edema ( 0 . 01 % ) , and angioedema ( 0 . 01 % ) resulted in withdrawal of treatment .
In elderly patients treated with lisinopril , discontinuation due to renal dysfunction was 4 . 2 % .
Other clinical adverse experiences occurring in 0 . 3 % to 1 . 0 % of patients with hypertension or heart failure treated with lisinopril in controlled clinical trials and rarer , serious , possibly drug - related events reported in uncontrolled studies or marketing experience are listed below , and within each category are in order of decreasing severity : Body as a Whole Anaphylactoid reactions ( see WARNINGS , Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions ) , syncope , orthostatic effects , chest discomfort , pain , pelvic pain , flank pain , edema , facial edema , virus infection , fever , chills , malaise .

Rash , photosensitivity or other dermatological manifestations may occur alone or in combination with these symptoms .
Angioedema : Angioedema has been reported in patients receiving lisinopril ( 0 . 1 % ) with an incidence higher in Black than in non - Black patients .
Angioedema associated with laryngeal edema may be fatal .
If angioedema of the face , extremities , lips , tongue , glottis and / or larynx occurs , treatment with lisinopril should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted immediately ( See WARNINGS ) .
In rare cases , intestinal angioedema has been reported in post marketing experience .
Hypotension : In hypertensive patients , hypotension occurred in 1 . 2 % and syncope occurred in 0 . 1 % of patients with an incidence higher in Black than in non - Black patients .
Hypotension or syncope was a cause of discontinuation of therapy in 0 . 5 % of hypertensive patients .
In patients with heart failure , hypotension occurred in 5 . 3 % and syncope occurred in 1 . 8 % of patients .
These adverse experiences were possibly dose - related ( see above data from ATLAS Trial ) and caused discontinuation of therapy in 1 . 8 % of these patients in the symptomatic trials .
In patients treated with lisinopril for six weeks after acute myocardial infarction , hypotension ( systolic blood pressure ( 100 mmHg ) resulted in discontinuation of therapy in 9 . 7 % of the patients .
( See WARNINGS ) .
Fetal / Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality : See WARNINGS , Fetal / Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality .
Cough : See PRECAUTIONS , Cough Pediatric Patients : No relevant differences between the adverse experience profile for pediatric patients and that previously reported for adult patients were identified .
CLINICAL LABORATORY TEST FINDINGS Serum Electrolytes : Hyperkalemia ( See PRECAUTIONS ) , hyponatremia .
Creatinine , Blood Urea Nitrogen : Minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine , reversible upon discontinuation of therapy , were observed in about 2 % of patients with essential hypertension treated with lisinopril alone .
Increases were more common in patients receiving concomitant diuretics and in patients with renal artery stenosis ( See PRECAUTIONS ) .
Reversible minor increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in approximately 11 . 6 % of patients with heart failure on concomitant diuretic therapy .
Frequently , these abnormalities resolved when the dosage of the diuretic was decreased .
Hemoglobin and Hematocrit : Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit ( mean decreases of approximately 0 . 4 g % and 1 . 3 vol % , respectively ) occurred frequently in patients treated with lisinopril but were rarely of clinical importance in patients without some other cause of anemia .
In clinical trials , less than 0 . 1 % of patients discontinued therapy due to anemia .
Hemolytic anemia has been reported ; a causal relationship to lisinopril cannot be excluded .
Liver Function Tests : Rarely , elevations of liver enzymes and / or serum bilirubin have occurred ( See WARNINGS , Hepatic Failure ) .
In hypertensive patients , 2 . 0 % discontinued therapy due to laboratory adverse experiences , principally elevations in blood urea nitrogen ( 0 . 6 % ) , serum creatinine ( 0 . 5 % ) and serum potassium ( 0 . 4 % ) .
In the heart failure trials , 3 . 4 % of patients discontinued therapy due to laboratory adverse experiences ; 1 . 8 % due to elevations in blood urea nitrogen and / or creatinine and 0 . 6 % due to elevations in serum potassium .
In the myocardial infarction trial , 2 . 0 % of patients receiving lisinopril discontinued therapy due to renal dysfunction ( increasing creatinine concentration to over 3 mg / dL or a doubling or more of the baseline serum creatinine concentration ) ; less than 1 . 0 % of patients discontinued therapy due to other laboratory adverse experiences : 0 . 1 % with hyperkalemia and less than 0 . 1 % with hepatic enzyme alterations .
OVERDOSAGE Following a single oral dose of 20 g / kg no lethality occurred in rats , and death occurred in one of 20 mice receiving the same dose .
The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension , for which the usual treatment would be intravenous infusion of normal saline solution .
Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis ( See WARNINGS , Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure ) .
