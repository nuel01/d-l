Patients should not take ramelteon tablets in conjunction with fluvoxamine [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
• History of angioedema while taking ramelteon tablets .
( 4 ) • Fluvoxamine ( strong CYP1A2 inhibitor ) : Increases AUC for ramelteon and should not be used in combination .
( 7 . 1 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Severe anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions : Angioedema and anaphylaxis have been reported .
Do not rechallenge if such reactions occur .
( 5 . 1 ) • Need to evaluate for comorbid diagnoses : Reevaluate if insomnia persists after 7 to 10 days of treatment .
( 5 . 2 ) • Abnormal thinking , behavioral changes , complex behaviors : May include “ sleep - driving ” and hallucinations .
Immediately evaluate any new onset behavioral changes .
( 5 . 3 ) • Depression : Worsening of depression or suicidal thinking may occur .
( 5 . 3 ) • CNS effects : Potential impairment of activities requiring complete mental alertness such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle , after ingesting the drug .
( 5 . 4 ) • Reproductive effects : Include decreased testosterone and increased prolactin levels .
Effect on reproductive axis in developing humans is unknown .
( 5 . 5 ) • Patients with severe sleep apnea : Ramelteon tablets are not recommended for use in this population .
( 5 . 6 ) 5 . 1 Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid Reactions Rare cases of angioedema involving the tongue , glottis or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of ramelteon tablets .
Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea , throat closing , or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis .
Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department .
If angioedema involves the tongue , glottis or larynx , airway obstruction may occur and be fatal .
Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with ramelteon tablets should not be rechallenged with the drug .
5 . 2 Need to Evaluate for Comorbid Diagnoses Since sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and / or psychiatric disorder , symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient .
The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and / or medical illness that should be evaluated .
Worsening of insomnia , or the emergence of new cognitive or behavioral abnormalities , may be the result of an unrecognized underlying psychiatric or physical disorder and requires further evaluation of the patient .
Exacerbation of insomnia and emergence of cognitive and behavioral abnormalities were seen with ramelteon tablets during the clinical development program .
5 . 3 Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes A variety of cognitive and behavior changes have been reported to occur in association with the use of hypnotics .
In primarily depressed patients , worsening of depression ( including suicidal ideation and completed suicides ) has been reported in association with the use of hypnotics .
Hallucinations , as well as behavioral changes such as bizarre behavior , agitation and mania have been reported with ramelteon tablets use .
Amnesia , anxiety and other neuro - psychiatric symptoms may also occur unpredictably .
Complex behaviors such as " sleep - driving " ( i . e . , driving while not fully awake after ingestion of a hypnotic ) and other complex behaviors ( e . g . , preparing and eating food , making phone calls , or having sex ) , with amnesia for the event , have been reported in association with hypnotic use .
The use of alcohol and other CNS depressants may increase the risk of such behaviors .
These events can occur in hypnotic - naive as well as in hypnotic - experienced persons .
Complex behaviors have been reported with the use of ramelteon tablets .
Discontinuation of ramelteon tablets should be strongly considered for patients who report any complex sleep behavior .
5 . 4 CNS Effects Patients should avoid engaging in hazardous activities that require concentration ( such as operating a motor vehicle or heavy machinery ) after taking ramelteon tablets .
After taking ramelteon tablets , patients should confine their activities to those necessary to prepare for bed .
Patients should be advised not to consume alcohol in combination with ramelteon tablets as alcohol and ramelteon tablets may have additive effects when used in conjunction .
5 . 5 Reproductive Effects Ramelteon tablets has been associated with an effect on reproductive hormones in adults , e . g . , decreased testosterone levels and increased prolactin levels .
It is not known what effect chronic or even chronic intermittent use of ramelteon tablets may have on the reproductive axis in developing humans [ see Clinical Trials ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 6 Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness Ramelteon tablets has not been studied in subjects with severe sleep apnea and is not recommended for use in this population [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Ramelteon tablets should not be used by patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 7 Laboratory Tests Monitoring No standard monitoring is required .
For patients presenting with unexplained amenorrhea , galactorrhea , decreased libido , or problems with fertility , assessment of prolactin levels and testosterone levels should be considered as appropriate .
Interference with Laboratory Tests Ramelteon tablets are not known to interfere with commonly used clinical laboratory tests .
In addition , in vitro data indicate that ramelteon does not cause false - positive results for benzodiazepines , opiates , barbiturates , cocaine , cannabinoids , or amphetamines in two standard urine drug screening methods in vitro .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections : • Severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Abnormal thinking , behavior changes , and complex behaviors [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • CNS effects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 3 % and more common than with placebo ) are : somnolence , dizziness , fatigue , nausea , and exacerbated insomnia .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Adverse Reactions Resulting in Discontinuation of Treatment The data described in this section reflect exposure to ramelteon tablets in 5373 subjects , including 722 exposed for six months or longer , and 448 subjects for one year .
Six percent of the 5373 individual subjects exposed to ramelteon tablets in clinical studies discontinued treatment owing to an adverse event , compared with 2 % of the 2279 subjects receiving placebo .
The most frequent adverse events leading to discontinuation in subjects receiving ramelteon tablets were somnolence , dizziness , nausea , fatigue , headache , and insomnia ; all of which occurred in 1 % of the patients or less .
Ramelteon Tablets Most Commonly Observed Adverse Events Table 1 displays the incidence of adverse events reported by the 2861 patients with chronic insomnia who participated in placebo - controlled trials of ramelteon tablets .
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of other drugs , and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does , however , provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates .

Fluconazole ( strong CYP2C9 inhibitor ) The AUC0 - inf and Cmax of ramelteon was increased by approximately 150 % when ramelteon was coadministered with fluconazole .
Ramelteon tablets should be administered with caution in subjects taking strong CYP2C9 inhibitors such as fluconazole [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 5 ) ] .
Donepezil The AUC0 - inf and Cmax of ramelteon increased by approximately 100 % and 87 % , respectively upon coadministration of donepezil with ramelteon tablets .
Patients should be closely monitored when ramelteon tablets are coadministered with donepezil [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 5 ) ] .
Doxepin The AUC0 - inf and Cmax of ramelteon increased by approximately 66 % and 69 % , respectively , upon coadministration of doxepin with ramelteon tablets .
Patients should be closely monitored when ramelteon tablets are coadministered with doxepin [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 5 ) ] .
7 . 2 Effect of Alcohol on Ramelteon Tablets Alcohol by itself impairs performance and can cause sleepiness .
Since the intended effect of ramelteon is to promote sleep , patients should be cautioned not to consume alcohol when using ramelteon tablets [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 5 ) ] .
Use of the products in combination may have an additive effect .
7 . 3 Drug / Laboratory Test Interactions Ramelteon tablets are not known to interfere with commonly used clinical laboratory tests .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pediatric use : Safety and effectiveness not established .
( 8 . 4 ) • Geriatric use : No overall differences in safety and efficacy between elderly and younger adult subjects .
( 8 . 5 ) • Hepatic impairment : Is not recommended in patients with severe impairment ; use with caution in moderate impairment .
( 8 . 8 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from postmarketing reports with ramelteon tablets use in pregnant women have not identified a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal studies , ramelteon produced evidence of developmental toxicity , including teratogenic effects , in rats at doses greater than 36 times the recommended human dose ( RHD ) of 8 mg / day based on body surface area ( mg / m2 ) ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Oral administration of ramelteon ( 10 , 40 , 150 or 600 mg / kg / day ) to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis was associated with increased incidences of fetal structural abnormalities ( malformations and variations ) at doses greater than 40 mg / kg / day .
The no - effect dose is approximately 50 times the RHD based on mg / m2 .
Treatment of pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis produced no evidence of embryo - fetal toxicity at oral doses of up to 300 mg / kg / day ( or up to 720 times the RHD based on mg / m2 ) .
When rats were orally administered ramelteon ( 30 , 100 , or 300 mg / kg / day ) throughout gestation and lactation , growth retardation , developmental delay , and behavioral changes were observed in the offspring at doses greater than 30 mg / kg / day .
The no - effect dose is 36 times the RHD based on mg / m2 .
Increased incidences of malformation and death among offspring were seen at the highest dose .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data regarding the presence of ramelteon or its metabolites in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Ramelteon and / or its metabolites are present in rat milk .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
Because of the mechanism of action of ramelteon , there is a potential risk for somnolence in a breastfed infant ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for ramelteon tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ramelteon tablets or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to ramelteon tablets through breastmilk should be monitored for somnolence and feeding problems .
A lactating woman may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment and for 25 hours ( approximately 5 elimination half - lives ) after ramelteon tablets administration in order to minimize drug exposure to a breastfed infant .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ramelteon tablets in pediatric patients have not been established .
Further study is needed prior to determining that this product may be used safely in prepubescent and pubescent patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use A total of 654 subjects in double - blind , placebo - controlled , efficacy trials who received ramelteon tablets were at least 65 years of age ; of these , 199 were 75 years of age or older .
No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between elderly and younger adult subjects .
A double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled study in elderly subjects with insomnia ( n = 33 ) evaluated the effect of a single dose of ramelteon tablets on balance , mobility , and memory functions after middle of the night awakening .
There is no information on the effect of multiple dosing .
Night time dosing of ramelteon tablets 8 mg did not impair middle of the night balance , mobility , or memory functions relative to placebo .
The effects on night balance in the elderly cannot be definitively known from this study .
8 . 6 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease The respiratory depressant effect of ramelteon tablets was evaluated in a crossover design study of subjects ( n = 26 ) with mild to moderate COPD after administering a single 16 mg dose or placebo , and in a separate study ( n = 25 ) , the effects of ramelteon tablets on respiratory parameters were evaluated after administering an 8 mg dose or placebo in a crossover design to patients with moderate to severe COPD , defined as patients who had forced expiratory volume at one second ( FEV1 ) / forced vital capacity ratio of < 70 % , and a FEV1 < 80 % of predicted with < 12 % reversibility to albuterol .
Treatment with a single dose of ramelteon tablets has no demonstrable respiratory depressant effects in subjects with mild to severe COPD , as measured by arterial O2 saturation ( SaO2 ) .
There is no available information on the respiratory effects of multiple doses of ramelteon tablets in patients with COPD .
The respiratory depressant effects in patients with COPD cannot be definitively known from this study .
8 . 7 Sleep Apnea The effects of ramelteon tablets were evaluated after administering a 16 mg dose or placebo in a crossover design to subjects ( n = 26 ) with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea .

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Ramelteon tablets are not a controlled substance .
Discontinuation of ramelteon in animals or in humans after chronic administration did not produce withdrawal signs .
Ramelteon does not appear to produce physical dependence .
Human Data A laboratory abuse potential study was performed with ramelteon tablets [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Animal Data Ramelteon did not produce any signals from animal behavioral studies indicating that the drug produces rewarding effects .
Monkeys did not self - administer ramelteon and the drug did not induce a conditioned place preference in rats .
There was no generalization between ramelteon and midazolam .
Ramelteon did not affect rotorod performance , an indicator of disruption of motor function , and it did not potentiate the ability of diazepam to interfere with rotorod performance .
10 OVERDOSAGE General symptomatic and supportive measures should be used , along with immediate gastric lavage where appropriate .
Intravenous fluids should be administered as needed .
As in all cases of drug overdose , respiration , pulse , blood pressure , and other appropriate vital signs should be monitored , and general supportive measures employed .
Hemodialysis does not effectively reduce exposure to ramelteon tablets .
Therefore , the use of dialysis in the treatment of overdosage is not appropriate .
Poison Control Center As with the management of all overdosage , the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered .
Contact a poison control center for current information on the management of overdosage .
11 DESCRIPTION Ramelteon Tablets are an orally active hypnotic chemically designated as ( S ) - N - [ 2 - ( 1 , 6 , 7 , 8 - tetrahydro - 2 H - indeno - [ 5 , 4 - b ] furan - 8 - yl ) ethyl ] propionamide and containing one chiral center .
The compound is produced as the ( S ) - enantiomer , with a molecular formula of C16H21NO2 , molecular weight of 259 . 34 , and the following chemical structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Ramelteon is freely soluble in organic solvents , such as methanol , ethanol , and dimethyl sulfoxide ; soluble in 1 - octanol and acetonitrile ; and very slightly soluble in water and in aqueous buffers from pH 3 to pH 11 .
Each Ramelteon Tablet includes the following inactive ingredients : lactose monohydrate , corn starch , hydroxylpropyl cellulose , magnesium stearate , hypromellose , titanium dioxide , triacetin and FD & C yellow # 6 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Ramelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist with both high affinity for melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors and relative selectivity over the MT3 receptor .
The activity of ramelteon at the MT1 and MT2 receptors is believed to contribute to its sleep - promoting properties , as these receptors , acted upon by endogenous melatonin , are thought to be involved in the maintenance of the circadian rhythm underlying the normal sleep - wake cycle .
Ramelteon has no appreciable affinity for the GABA receptor complex or for receptors that bind neuropeptides , cytokines , serotonin , dopamine , noradrenaline , acetylcholine , and opiates .
Ramelteon also does not interfere with the activity of a number of selected enzymes in a standard panel .
The major metabolite of ramelteon , M - II , is pharmacologically active and has approximately one tenth and one fifth the binding affinity of the parent molecule for the human MT1 and MT2 receptors , respectively .
However , M - II circulates at higher concentrations than the parent producing 20 - to 100 - fold greater mean systemic exposure when compared to ramelteon .
Similar to ramelteon , M - II does not interfere with the activity of a number of endogenous enzymes .
All other known metabolites of ramelteon are inactive .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic profile of ramelteon tablets has been evaluated in healthy subjects as well as in subjects with hepatic or renal impairment .
When administered orally to humans in doses ranging from 4 to 64 mg , ramelteon undergoes rapid , high first - pass metabolism , and exhibits linear pharmacokinetics .
Maximal serum concentration ( Cmax ) and area under the concentration - time curve ( AUC ) data show substantial intersubject variability , consistent with the high first - pass effect ; the coefficient of variation for these values is approximately 100 % .
Several metabolites have been identified in human serum and urine .
Absorption Ramelteon is absorbed rapidly , with median peak concentrations occurring at approximately 0 . 75 hour ( range , 0 . 5 to 1 . 5 hours ) after fasted oral administration .
Although the total absorption of ramelteon is at least 84 % , the absolute oral bioavailability is only 1 . 8 % due to extensive first - pass metabolism .
Distribution In vitro protein binding of ramelteon is approximately 82 % in human serum , independent of concentration .
Binding to albumin accounts for most of that binding , since 70 % of the drug is bound in human serum albumin .
Ramelteon is not distributed selectively to red blood cells .
Ramelteon has a mean volume of distribution after intravenous administration of 73 . 6 L , suggesting substantial tissue distribution .
Metabolism Metabolism of ramelteon consists primarily of oxidation to hydroxyl and carbonyl derivatives , with secondary metabolism producing glucuronide conjugates .
CYP1A2 is the major isozyme involved in the hepatic metabolism of ramelteon ; the CYP2C subfamily and CYP3A4 isozymes are also involved to a minor degree .
The rank order of the principal metabolites by prevalence in human serum is M - II , M - IV , M - I , and M - III .
These metabolites are formed rapidly and exhibit a monophasic decline and rapid elimination .
The overall mean systemic exposure of M - II is approximately 20 - to 100 - fold higher than parent drug .
Elimination Following oral administration of radiolabeled ramelteon , 84 % of total radioactivity was excreted in urine and approximately 4 % in feces , resulting in a mean recovery of 88 % .
Less than 0 . 1 % of the dose was excreted in urine and feces as the parent compound .
Elimination was essentially complete by 96 hours postdose .
Repeated once daily dosing with ramelteon tablets does not result in significant accumulation owing to the short elimination half - life of ramelteon ( on average , approximately one to 2 . 6 hours ) .
The half - life of M - II is two to five hours and independent of dose .
Serum concentrations of the parent drug and its metabolites in humans are at or below the lower limits of quantitation within 24 hours .
Effect of Food When administered with a high - fat meal , the AUC0 - inf for a single 16 mg dose of ramelteon tablets was 31 % higher and the Cmax was 22 % lower than when given in a fasted state .
Median Tmax was delayed by approximately 45 minutes when ramelteon was administered with food .
Effects of food on the AUC values for M - II were similar .
It is therefore recommended that ramelteon tablets not be taken with or immediately after a high - fat meal [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
12 . 4 Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Age In a group of 24 elderly subjects aged 63 to 79 years administered a single ramelteon tablets 16 mg dose , the mean Cmax and AUC0 - inf values were 11 . 6 ng / mL ( SD , 13 . 8 ) and 18 . 7 ng • hr / mL ( SD , 19 . 4 ) , respectively .
The elimination half - life was 2 . 6 hours ( SD , 1 . 1 ) .
Compared with younger adults , the total exposure ( AUC0 - inf ) and Cmax of ramelteon were 97 and 86 % higher , respectively , in elderly subjects .
The AUC0 - inf and Cmax of M - II were increased by 30 and 13 % , respectively , in elderly subjects .
Gender There are no clinically meaningful gender - related differences in the pharmacokinetics of ramelteon tablets or its metabolites .
Hepatic Impairment Exposure to ramelteon tablets was increased almost four - fold in subjects with mild hepatic impairment after seven days of dosing with 16 mg / day ; exposure was further increased ( more than ten - fold ) in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment .
Exposure to M - II was only marginally increased in mildly and moderately impaired subjects relative to healthy matched controls .
The pharmacokinetics of ramelteon tablets have not been evaluated in subjects with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) .
Ramelteon tablets should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetic characteristics of ramelteon tablets were studied after administering a 16 mg dose to subjects with mild , moderate , or severe renal impairment based on predose creatinine clearance ( 53 to 95 , 35 to 49 , or 15 to 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 , respectively ) , and in subjects who required chronic hemodialysis .
Wide intersubject variability was seen in ramelteon tablets exposure parameters .
However , no effects on Cmax or AUC0 - t of parent drug or M - II were seen in any of the treatment groups ; the incidence of adverse events was similar across groups .
These results are consistent with the negligible renal clearance of ramelteon , which is principally eliminated via hepatic metabolism .
No adjustment of ramelteon tablets dosage is required in patients with renal impairment , including patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance of ≤ 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) and patients who require chronic hemodialysis .
12 . 5 Drug - Drug Interactions Ramelteon has a highly variable intersubject pharmacokinetic profile ( approximately 100 % coefficient of variation in Cmax and AUC ) .
As noted above , CYP1A2 is the major isozyme involved in the metabolism of ramelteon tablets ; the CYP2C subfamily and CYP3A4 isozymes are also involved to a minor degree .
Effects of Other Drugs on Ramelteon Tablets Metabolism Fluvoxamine ( strong CYP1A2 inhibitor ) When fluvoxamine 100 mg twice daily was administered for three days prior to single - dose coadministration of ramelteon tablets 16 mg and fluvoxamine , the AUC0 - inf for ramelteon increased approximately 190 - fold , and the Cmax increased approximately 70 - fold , compared to ramelteon tablets administered alone .
Ramelteon tablets should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine .
Other less strong CYP1A2 inhibitors have not been adequately studied .
Ramelteon tablets should be administered with caution to patients taking less strong CYP1A2 inhibitors [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Rifampin ( strong CYP enzyme inducer ) Administration of rifampin 600 mg once daily for 11 days resulted in a mean decrease of approximately 80 % ( 40 to 90 % ) in total exposure to ramelteon and metabolite M - II , ( both AUC0 - inf and Cmax ) after a single 32 mg dose of ramelteon tablets .
Efficacy may be reduced when ramelteon tablets are used in combination with strong CYP enzyme inducers such as rifampin [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Ketoconazole ( strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ) The AUC0 - inf and Cmax of ramelteon increased by approximately 84 % and 36 % , respectively , when a single 16 mg dose of ramelteon tablets was administered on the fourth day of ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily administration , compared to administration of ramelteon tablets alone .
Similar increases were seen in M - II pharmacokinetic variables .
Ramelteon tablets should be administered with caution in subjects taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Fluconazole ( strong CYP2C9 inhibitor ) The total and peak systemic exposure ( AUC0 - inf and Cmax ) of ramelteon after a single 16 mg dose of ramelteon tablets was increased by approximately 150 % when administered with fluconazole .
Similar increases were also seen in M - II exposure .
Ramelteon tablets should be administered with caution in subjects taking strong CYP2C9 inhibitors such as fluconazole [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Donepezil Administration of donepezil 10 mg once daily for 26 days resulted in a mean increase of approximately 100 % in overall exposure to ramelteon , ( AUC0 - inf ) and a mean increase of approximately 87 % in maximum exposure to ramelteon ( Cmax ) after a single 8 mg dose of ramelteon tablets .
No change was seen in M - II exposure .
Patients should be closely monitored when ramelteon tablets are coadministered with donepezil [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Doxepin Administration of doxepin 10 mg once daily for 23 days resulted in a mean increase of approximately 66 % in overall exposure to ramelteon , ( AUC0 - inf ) and a mean increase of approximately 69 % in maximum exposure to ramelteon ( Cmax ) after a single 8 mg dose of ramelteon tablets .
No change was seen in M - II exposure .
Patients should be closely monitored when ramelteon tablets are coadministered with doxepin [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Interaction studies of concomitant administration of ramelteon tablets with fluoxetine ( CYP2D6 inhibitor ) , omeprazole ( CYP1A2 inducer / CYP2C19 inhibitor ) , theophylline ( CYP1A2 substrate ) , dextromethorphan ( CYP2D6 substrate ) , sertraline , venlafaxine , escitalopram , gabapentin , and zolpidem did not produce clinically meaningful changes in either peak or total exposures to ramelteon or the M - II metabolite .
Effects of Ramelteon Tablets on Metabolism of Other Drugs Zolpidem Administration of ramelteon 8 mg once daily for 11 days resulted in an increase in median Tmax of zolpidem by approximately 20 minutes and exposure to zolpidem ( both AUC0 - inf and Cmax ) was unchanged after a single 10 mg dose of zolpidem .
Ordinarily zolpidem should not be given in a patient taking ramelteon tablets .
Concomitant administration of ramelteon tablets with omeprazole ( CYP2C19 substrate ) , dextromethorphan ( CYP2D6 substrate ) , midazolam ( CYP3A4 substrate ) , theophylline ( CYP1A2 substrate ) , digoxin ( p - glycoprotein substrate ) , warfarin ( CYP2C9 [ S ] / CYP1A2 [ R ] substrate ) , venlafaxine , fluvoxamine , donepezil , doxepin , sertraline , escitalopram , and gabapentin did not produce clinically meaningful changes in peak and total exposures to these drugs .
Effect of Alcohol on Ramelteon Tablets With single - dose , daytime coadministration of ramelteon tablets 32 mg and alcohol ( 0 . 6 g / kg ) , there were no clinically meaningful or statistically significant effects on peak or total exposure to ramelteon tablets .
However , an additive effect was seen on some measures of psychomotor performance ( i . e . , the Digit Symbol Substitution Test , the Psychomotor Vigilance Task Test , and a Visual Analog Scale of Sedation ) at some postdose time points .
No additive effect was seen on the Delayed Word Recognition Test .
Because alcohol by itself impairs performance , and the intended effect of ramelteon tablets is to promote sleep , patients should be cautioned not to consume alcohol when using ramelteon tablets .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Ramelteon was administered to mice and rats at oral doses of 0 , 30 , 100 , 300 , or 1000 mg / kg / day ( mice ) and 0 , 15 , 60 , 250 , or 1000 mg / kg / day ( rats ) .
Mice and rats were dosed for two years , except at the high dose ( 94 weeks for male and female mice and female rats ) .
In mice , dose - related increases in the incidence of hepatic tumors ( adenomas , carcinomas , hepatoblastomas ) were observed in males and females .
The no - effect dose for hepatic tumors in mice ( 30 mg / kg / day ) is approximately 20 times the recommended human dose ( RHD ) of 8 mg / day based on body surface area ( mg / m2 ) .
In rats , the incidence of hepatic adenoma and benign Leydig cell tumors of the testis was increased in males at doses ≥ 250 mg / kg / day .
In females , the incidence of hepatic adenoma was increased at doses ≥ 60 mg / kg / day .
The incidence of hepatic carcinoma was increased in males and female rats at 1000 mg / kg / day .
The no - effect dose for tumors in rats ( 15 mg / kg / day ) is approximately 20 times the RHD based on mg / m2 .
Mutagenesis Ramelteon was not genotoxic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay , the in vitro mouse lymphoma TK + / - assay , and in in vivo oral micronucleus assays in mouse and rat .
Ramelteon was clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells .
The M - II metabolite was not tested for genotoxicity .
However , it was present in the test medium of the parent drug at concentrations higher than those of the parent .
Impairment of Fertility When ramelteon ( doses of 6 to 600 mg / kg / day ) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and during mating and early gestation , alterations in estrus cyclicity and decreased numbers of corpora lutea , implantations , and live embryos were observed at doses greater than 20 mg / kg / day .
The no - effect dose is approximately 24 times the RHD of 8 mg / day based on mg / m2 .
Oral administration of ramelteon ( up to 600 mg / kg / day ) to male rats had no effects on sperm quality or reproductive performance .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Controlled Clinical Trials Chronic Insomnia Three randomized , double - blind trials in subjects with chronic insomnia employing polysomnography ( PSG ) were provided as objective support of ramelteon ’ s effectiveness in sleep initiation .
One study enrolled younger adults ( aged 18 to 64 years , inclusive ) with chronic insomnia and employed a parallel design in which the subjects received a single , nightly dose of ramelteon tablets ( 8 or 16 mg ) or matching placebo for 35 days .
PSG was performed on the first two nights in each of Weeks 1 , 3 , and 5 of treatment .
Ramelteon tablets reduced the average latency to persistent sleep at each of the time points when compared to placebo .
The 16 mg dose conferred no additional benefit for sleep initiation .
The second study employing PSG was a three - period crossover trial performed in subjects aged 65 years and older with a history of chronic insomnia .
Subjects received ramelteon tablets ( 4 or 8 mg ) or placebo and underwent PSG assessment in a sleep laboratory for two consecutive nights in each of the three study periods .
Both doses of ramelteon tablets reduced latency to persistent sleep when compared to placebo .
The third study evaluated long - term efficacy and safety in adults with chronic insomnia .
Subjects received a single , nightly dose of ramelteon tablets 8 mg or matching placebo for six months .
PSG was performed on the first two nights of Week 1 and Months 1 , 3 , 5 , and 6 .
Ramelteon tablets reduced sleep latency at each time point when compared to placebo .
In this study , when the PSG results from nights 1 and 2 of Month 7 were compared to the results from nights 22 and 23 of Month 6 , there was a statistically significant increase in LPS of 33 % ( 9 . 5 minutes ) in the ramelteon group .
There was no increase in LPS in the placebo group when the same time periods were compared .
A randomized , double - blind , parallel group study was conducted in outpatients aged 65 years and older with chronic insomnia and employed subjective measures of efficacy ( sleep diaries ) .
Subjects received ramelteon tablets ( 4 or 8 mg ) or placebo for 35 nights .
Ramelteon tablets reduced patient - reported sleep latency compared to placebo .
A similarly designed study performed in younger adults ( aged 18 to 64 years ) using 8 and 16 mg of ramelteon did not replicate this finding of reduced patient - reported sleep latency compared to placebo .
While the 16 mg dose was evaluated as a potential treatment for adults , it was shown to confer no additional benefit for sleep initiation and was associated with higher incidences of fatigue , headache and next - day somnolence .
Transient Insomnia In a randomized , double - blind , parallel - group trial using a first - night - effect model , healthy adults received placebo or ramelteon tablets before spending one night in a sleep laboratory and being evaluated with PSG .
Ramelteon tablets demonstrated a decrease in mean latency to persistent sleep as compared to placebo .
14 . 2 Studies Pertinent to Safety Concerns for Sleep - Promoting Drugs Results from Human Laboratory Abuse Liability Studies A human laboratory abuse potential study was performed in 14 subjects with a history of sedative / hypnotic or anxiolytic drug abuse .
Subjects received single oral doses of ramelteon tablets ( 16 , 80 , or 160 mg ) , triazolam ( 0 . 25 , 0 . 50 , or 0 . 75 mg ) or placebo .
All subjects received each of the seven treatments separated by a wash - out period and underwent multiple standard tests of abuse potential .
No differences in subjective responses indicative of abuse potential were found between ramelteon tablets and placebo at doses up to 20 times the recommended therapeutic dose .
The positive control drug , triazolam , consistently showed a dose - response effect on these subjective measures , as demonstrated by the differences from placebo in peak effect and overall 24 hour effect .
Residual Pharmacological Effect in Insomnia Trials In order to evaluate potential next - day residual effects , the following scales were used : a Memory Recall Test , a Word List Memory Test , a Visual Analog Mood and Feeling Scale , the Digit - Symbol Substitution Test , and a post sleep questionnaire to assess alertness and ability to concentrate .
There was no evidence of next - day residual effect seen after two nights of ramelteon use during the crossover studies .
In a 35 night , double - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel - group study in adults with chronic insomnia , measures of residual effects were performed at three time points .
Overall , the magnitudes of any observed differences were small .
At Week 1 , patients who received 8 mg of ramelteon tablets had a mean VAS score ( 46 mm on a 100 mm scale ) indicating more fatigue in comparison to patients who received placebo ( 42 mm ) .
At Week 3 , patients who received 8 mg of ramelteon tablets had a lower mean score for immediate recall ( 7 . 5 out of 16 words ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 8 . 2 words ) ; and the patients treated with ramelteon tablets had a mean VAS score indicating more sluggishness ( 27 mm on a 100 mm VAS ) in comparison to the placebo - treated patients ( 22 mm ) .
Patients who received ramelteon tablets did not have next - morning residual effects that were different from placebo at Week 5 .
Rebound Insomnia / Withdrawal Potential rebound insomnia and withdrawal effects were assessed in four studies in which subjects received ramelteon tablets or placebo for up to six months ; three were 35 day studies , one was a six month study .
These studies included a total of 2533 subjects , of whom 854 were elderly .
Tyrer Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Symptom Questionnaire ( BWSQ ) The BWSQ is a self - report questionnaire that solicits specific information on 20 symptoms commonly experienced during withdrawal from benzodiazepine receptor agonists ; ramelteon tablets are not a benzodiazepine receptor agonist .
In two of the three 35 day insomnia studies , the questionnaire was administered one week after completion of treatment ; in the third study , the questionnaire was administered on Days 1 and 2 after completion .
In all three of the 35 day studies , subjects receiving ramelteon tablets 4 , 8 , or 16 mg daily reported BWSQ scores similar to those of subjects receiving placebo .
In the six month study , there was no evidence of withdrawal from the 8 mg dose as measured by the BWSQ .
Rebound Insomnia Rebound insomnia was assessed in the 35 day studies by measuring sleep latency after abrupt treatment discontinuation .
One of these studies employed PSG in younger adult subjects receiving ramelteon tablets 8 or 16 mg ; the other two studies employed subjective measures of sleep - onset insomnia in elderly subjects receiving ramelteon tablets 4 or 8 mg , and in younger adult subjects receiving ramelteon tablets 8 or 16 mg .
There was no evidence that ramelteon tablets caused rebound insomnia during the posttreatment period .
14 . 3 Studies to Evaluate Effects on Endocrine Function Two controlled studies evaluated the effects of ramelteon tablets on endocrine function .
In the first trial , ramelteon tablets 16 mg once daily or placebo was administered to 99 healthy volunteer subjects for four weeks .
This study evaluated the thyroid axis , adrenal axis and reproductive axis .
No clinically significant endocrinopathies were demonstrated in this study .
However , the study was limited in its ability to detect such abnormalities due to its limited duration .
In the second trial , ramelteon tablets 16 mg once daily or placebo was administered to 122 subjects with chronic insomnia for six months .
This study evaluated the thyroid axis , adrenal axis and reproductive axis .
There were no significant abnormalities seen in either the thyroid or the adrenal axes .
Abnormalities were , however , noted within the reproductive axis .
Overall , the mean serum prolactin level change from baseline was 4 . 9 mcg / L ( 34 % increase ) for women in the ramelteon tablets group compared with - 0 . 6 mcg / L ( 4 % decrease ) for women in the placebo group ( p = 0 . 003 ) .
No differences between active - and placebo - treated groups occurred among men .
Thirty two percent of all patients who were treated with ramelteon in this study ( women and men ) had prolactin levels that increased from normal baseline levels compared to 19 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
Subject - reported menstrual patterns were similar between the two treatment groups .
In a 12 month , open - label study in adult and elderly patients , there were two patients who were noted to have abnormal morning cortisol levels , and subsequent abnormal ACTH stimulation tests .
A 29 year old female patient was diagnosed with a prolactinoma .
The relationship of these events to ramelteon tablets therapy is not clear .
