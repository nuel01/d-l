( 5 . 1 ) 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE DOVATO is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV - 1 infection in adults with no antiretroviral treatment history or to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed ( HIV - 1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL ) on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of DOVATO .
DOVATO , a two - drug combination of dolutegravir ( integrase strand transfer inhibitor [ INSTI ] ) and lamivudine ( nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor [ NRTI ] ) is indicated as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV - 1 infection in adults with no antiretroviral treatment history or to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically suppressed ( HIV - 1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL ) on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of DOVATO .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • • Prior to or when initiating DOVATO , test patients for hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection .
( 2 . 1 ) • • Pregnancy testing : Pregnancy testing is recommended before initiation of DOVATO in individuals of childbearing potential .
( 2 . 1 , 5 . 4 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) • • One tablet taken orally once daily with or without food .
( 2 . 2 ) • • The dolutegravir dose ( 50 mg ) in DOVATO is insufficient when coadministered with carbamazepine or rifampin .
If DOVATO is coadministered with carbamazepine or rifampin , take one tablet of DOVATO once daily , followed by an additional dolutegravir 50 - mg tablet , approximately 12 hours from the dose of DOVATO .
( 2 . 3 ) 2 . 1 Testing Prior to or When Initiating Treatment with DOVATO Prior to or when initiating DOVATO , test patients for HBV infection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy testing is recommended before initiation of DOVATO in individuals of childbearing potential [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 2 Recommended Dosage DOVATO is a fixed - dose combination product containing 50 mg of dolutegravir and 300 mg of lamivudine .
The recommended dosage regimen of DOVATO in adults is one tablet taken orally once daily with or without food [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 3 Recommended Dosage with Certain Coadministered Drugs The dolutegravir dose ( 50 mg ) in DOVATO is insufficient when coadministered with drugs listed in Table 1 that may decrease dolutegravir concentrations ; the following dolutegravir dosage regimen is recommended .
Table 1 .
Dosing Recommendations for DOVATO with Coadministered DrugsCoadministered Drug Dosing Recommendation Carbamazepine , rifampin An additional dolutegravir 50 - mg tablet , separated by 12 hours from DOVATO , should be taken .
2 . 4 Not Recommended in Patients with Renal Impairment Because DOVATO is a fixed - dose tablet and cannot be dose adjusted , DOVATO is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL per minute [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
2 . 5 Not Recommended in Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment DOVATO is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Score C ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS DOVATO tablets are oval , biconvex , white , film - coated tablets , debossed with “ SV 137 ” on one face .
Each tablet contains 50 mg of dolutegravir and 300 mg of lamivudine .
Tablets : 50 mg of dolutegravir and 300 mg of lamivudine .
( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS DOVATO is contraindicated in patients : • • with prior hypersensitivity reaction to dolutegravir [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] or lamivudine .
• • receiving dofetilide due to the potential for increased dofetilide plasma concentrations and the risk for serious and / or life - threatening events [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
• • Prior hypersensitivity reaction to dolutegravir or lamivudine .
( 4 ) • • Coadministration with dofetilide .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash , constitutional findings , and sometimes organ dysfunction , including liver injury , have been reported with dolutegravir .
Discontinue DOVATO immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop , as a delay in stopping treatment may result in a life - threatening reaction .
( 5 . 2 ) • • Hepatotoxicity has been reported in patients receiving a dolutegravir - containing regimen .
Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations with DOVATO .
Monitoring for hepatotoxicity is recommended .
( 5 . 3 ) • • Embryo - fetal toxicity may occur when used at the time of conception and in early pregnancy .
Assess the risks and benefits of DOVATO and discuss with the patient to determine if an alternative treatment should be considered at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy or if pregnancy is confirmed in the first trimester due to the risk of neural tube defects .
Individuals of childbearing potential should be counseled on the consistent use of effective contraception .
( 2 . 1 , 5 . 4 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) • • Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis , including fatal cases , have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues .
( 5 . 5 ) • • Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy .
( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Patients Co - infected with HIV - 1 and HBV : Emergence of Lamivudine - Resistant HBV and the Risk of Posttreatment Exacerbations of HBV All patients with HIV - 1 should be tested for the presence of HBV prior to or when initiating DOVATO .
Emergence of Lamivudine - Resistant HBV Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established for treatment of chronic HBV in subjects dually infected with HIV - 1 and HBV .
Emergence of HBV variants associated with resistance to lamivudine has been reported in HIV ‑ 1 – infected subjects who have received lamivudine ‑ containing antiretroviral regimens in the presence of concurrent infection with HBV .
If a decision is made to administer DOVATO to patients co - infected with HIV - 1 and HBV , additional treatment should be considered for appropriate treatment of chronic HBV ; otherwise , consider an alternative regimen .
Severe Acute Exacerbations of HBV in Patients Co - infected with HIV - 1 and HBV Severe acute exacerbations of HBV have been reported in patients who are co - infected with HIV - 1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing lamivudine , and may occur with discontinuation of DOVATO .
Patients who are co - infected with HIV - 1 and HBV who discontinue DOVATO should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow - up for at least several months after stopping treatment with DOVATO .
If appropriate , initiation of anti - HBV therapy may be warranted , especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis , since posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure .
5 . 2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with the use of dolutegravir , a component of DOVATO , and were characterized by rash , constitutional findings , and sometimes organ dysfunction , including liver injury .
These events were reported in < 1 % of subjects receiving dolutegravir in Phase 3 clinical trials .
Discontinue DOVATO immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions develop ( including , but not limited to , severe rash or rash accompanied by fever , general malaise , fatigue , muscle or joint aches , blisters or peeling of the skin , oral blisters or lesions , conjunctivitis , facial edema , hepatitis , eosinophilia , angioedema , difficulty breathing ) .
Clinical status , including liver aminotransferases , should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated .
Delay in stopping treatment with DOVATO or other suspect agents after the onset of hypersensitivity may result in a life - threatening reaction [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
5 . 3 Hepatotoxicity Hepatic adverse events have been reported in patients receiving a dolutegravir - containing regimen [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C may be at increased risk for worsening or development of transaminase elevations with use of DOVATO [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In some cases , the elevations in transaminases were consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome or HBV reactivation particularly in the setting where anti - hepatitis therapy was withdrawn .
Cases of hepatic toxicity , including elevated serum liver biochemistries , hepatitis , and acute liver failure , have also been reported in patients receiving a dolutegravir - containing regimen who had no pre - existing hepatic disease or other identifiable risk factors .
Drug - induced liver injury leading to liver transplant has been reported with TRIUMEQ ( abacavir , dolutegravir , and lamivudine ) .
Monitoring for hepatotoxicity is recommended .
5 . 4 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity An ongoing observational study showed an association between dolutegravir and an increased risk of neural tube defects when dolutegravir was administered at the time of conception and in early pregnancy .
As there is limited understanding of the association of reported types of neural tube defects with dolutegravir use , inform individuals of childbearing potential , including those actively trying to become pregnant , about the potential increased risk of neural tube defects with DOVATO .
Assess the risks and benefits of DOVATO and discuss with the patient to determine if an alternative treatment should be considered at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy or if pregnancy is confirmed in the first trimester [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .
Pregnancy testing is recommended before initiation of DOVATO in individuals of childbearing potential [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Individuals of childbearing potential should be counseled on the consistent use of effective contraception [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .
DOVATO may be considered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy if the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the pregnant woman and the fetus .
5 . 5 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis , including fatal cases , have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues , including lamivudine ( a component of DOVATO ) .
A majority of these cases have been in women .
Female sex and obesity may be risk factors for the development of lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretroviral nucleoside analogues .
Monitor closely when administering DOVATO to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease .
Treatment with DOVATO should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity , which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations .
5 . 6 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions The coadministration of DOVATO and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions , some of which may lead to [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) ] : • • Loss of therapeutic effect of DOVATO and possible development of resistance .
• • Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of coadministered drugs .
See Table 5 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions , including dosing recommendations .
Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy with DOVATO , review coadministered drugs during therapy with DOVATO , and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the coadministered drugs .
5 . 7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy , including DOVATO .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [ PCP ] , or tuberculosis ) , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
Autoimmune disorders ( such as Graves ’ disease , polymyositis , and Guillain - Barré syndrome ) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution ; however , the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling : • • Patients co - infected with HIV - 1 and HBV [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Hypersensitivity reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • • Hepatotoxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • • Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • • Immune reconstitution syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] The most common adverse reactions ( all grades ) observed in ≥ 2 % ( in those receiving DOVATO ) were headache , nausea , diarrhea , insomnia , fatigue , and anxiety .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
Clinical Trials in Adults with No Antiretroviral Treatment History The safety assessment of DOVATO in HIV - 1 – infected adults with no antiretroviral treatment history and with a plasma viral load ≤ 500 , 000 HIV - 1 RNA copies / mL at the screening visit , is based on the pooled Week 144 analyses of data from 2 identical , multicenter , double - blind , controlled trials , GEMINI - 1 and GEMINI - 2 .
A total of 1 , 433 HIV - 1 – infected adults with no antiretroviral treatment history received either dolutegravir ( TIVICAY ) 50 mg plus lamivudine ( EPIVIR ) 300 mg , as a complete regimen once daily , or TIVICAY 50 mg plus fixed - dose combination tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) / emtricitabine ( FTC ) ( TRUVADA ) , administered once daily .
The rates of adverse events leading to discontinuation in the pooled analysis were 4 % of subjects who received TIVICAY plus EPIVIR and 5 % in subjects who received TIVICAY plus TRUVADA .
The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were psychiatric disorders : 2 % of subjects who received TIVICAY plus EPIVIR and 1 % in subjects who received TIVICAY plus TRUVADA .
Adverse reactions ( all grades ) observed in at least 2 % of subjects in either treatment arm of the Week 144 pooled analysis from GEMINI - 1 and GEMINI - 2 trials are provided in Table 2 .
The adverse reactions observed for TIVICAY plus EPIVIR in the Week 144 analysis of the pooled data from GEMINI - 1 and GEMINI - 2 were generally consistent with the adverse reaction profiles and severities for the individual components when administered with other antiretroviral agents .
Table 2 .
Adverse Reactions ( All Grades ) Reported in ≥ 2 % of Subjects in Any Treatment Group in Adults with No Antiretroviral Treatment History in GEMINI - 1 and GEMINI - 2 ( Week 144 Pooled Analysis ) a Fatigue : includes fatigue , asthenia , and malaise .
Adverse Reaction TIVICAY plus EPIVIR ( n = 716 ) TIVICAY plus TRUVADA ( n = 717 ) Headache 3 % 4 % Nausea 2 % 6 % Diarrhea 2 % 3 % Insomnia 2 % 3 % Fatiguea 2 % 2 % Anxiety 2 % 1 % Dizziness 1 % 2 % Adverse reactions of at least Grade 2 occurring in ≥ 1 % of subjects treated with TIVICAY plus EPIVIR were headache , anxiety , suicidal ideation , and insomnia ( all at 1 % ) .
Less Common Adverse Reactions : The following adverse reactions ( all grades ) occurred in < 2 % of subjects receiving dolutegravir plus lamivudine or are from studies described in the prescribing information of the individual components , TIVICAY ( dolutegravir ) and EPIVIR ( lamivudine ) .
Some events have been included because of their seriousness and assessment of potential causal relationship .
Blood and Lymphatic Systems Disorders : Anemia , neutropenia , thrombocytopenia .
Gastrointestinal Disorders : Abdominal discomfort , abdominal pain , flatulence , upper abdominal pain , vomiting .
General : Fever .
Hepatobiliary Disorders : Hepatitis .
Immune System Disorders : Hypersensitivity , immune reconstitution syndrome .
Musculoskeletal Disorders : Myositis .
Nervous System Disorders : Somnolence .
Psychiatric Disorders : Abnormal dreams , depression .
Suicidal ideation , attempt , behavior , or completion ; these events were observed primarily in subjects with a pre - existing history of depression or other psychiatric illness .
Renal and Urinary Disorders : Renal impairment .
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Pruritus , rash .
Clinical Trials in Virologically Suppressed Adults The safety of DOVATO in virologically suppressed adults was based on Week 144 data from 740 subjects in a randomized , parallel - group , open - label , multicenter , non - inferiority controlled trial ( TANGO ) .
Subjects who were on a stable suppressive tenofovir alafenamide - based regimen ( TBR ) were randomized to receive DOVATO once daily or continue with their TBR for up to 148 weeks ; at Week 148 , the subjects randomized to continue with their TBR were switched to DOVATO once daily .
All subjects are followed up to Week 200 .
Overall , the safety profile of DOVATO in virologically suppressed adult subjects in the TANGO trial was similar to that of TIVICAY plus EPIVIR in subjects with no antiretroviral treatment history in the GEMINI trials [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Adverse reactions observed in at least 2 % of subjects in the TANGO trial who were treated with DOVATO were weight increased ( 3 % ) and insomnia ( 2 % ) .
Laboratory Abnormalities Selected laboratory abnormalities with a worsening grade from baseline and representing the worst - grade toxicity are presented in Table 3 .
The mean change from baseline observed for selected lipid values is presented in Table 4 .

Changes in Serum Creatinine : Dolutegravir has been shown to increase serum creatinine due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Increases in serum creatinine occurred within the first 4 weeks of treatment in both arms and remained stable through 144 weeks .
A mean change from baseline of 0 . 144 mg / dL and 0 . 176 mg / dL was observed after 144 weeks of treatment with TIVICAY plus EPIVIR and TIVICAY plus TRUVADA , respectively .
These changes are not considered to be clinically relevant .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing experience in patients receiving a dolutegravir - or lamivudine - containing regimen .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • • DOVATO is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV - 1 infection ; therefore , coadministration with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV - 1 infection is not recommended .
( 7 . 1 ) • • Refer to the full prescribing information for important drug interactions with DOVATO .
( 4 , 5 . 6 , 7 ) 7 . 1 Coadministration with Other Antiretroviral Drugs DOVATO is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV - 1 infection ; therefore , coadministration with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV - 1 infection is not recommended [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
Information regarding potential drug - drug interactions with other antiretroviral drugs is not provided [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Potential for DOVATO to Affect Other Drugs Dolutegravir , a component of DOVATO , inhibits the renal organic cation transporters ( OCT ) 2 and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter ( MATE ) 1 ; thus , it may increase plasma concentrations of drugs eliminated via OCT2 or MATE1 such as dofetilide , dalfampridine , and metformin [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 3 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect the Components of DOVATO Dolutegravir is metabolized by uridine diphosphate ( UDP ) - glucuronosyl transferase ( UGT ) 1A1 with some contribution from cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3 A .
Dolutegravir is also a substrate of UGT1A3 , UGT1A9 , breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) , and P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) in vitro .
Drugs that induce those enzymes and transporters may decrease dolutegravir plasma concentrations and reduce the therapeutic effect of DOVATO [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Coadministration of DOVATO and other drugs that inhibit these enzymes may increase dolutegravir plasma concentrations .
Coadministration of dolutegravir with polyvalent cation - containing products may lead to decreased absorption of dolutegravir [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 4 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions No drug interaction studies were conducted with DOVATO .
The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with dolutegravir or lamivudine when administered alone [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Information regarding potential drug interactions with DOVATO are provided in Table 5 .
These recommendations are based on either drug interaction trials or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse events or loss of efficacy [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Table 5 .
Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions for DOVATO : Alterations in Dose May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Trials or Predicted Interactions ↑ = Increase , ↓ = Decrease .
a See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) Table 8 or Table 9 for magnitude of interaction .
Coadministered Drug Class : Drug Name Effect on Concentration Clinical Comment Antiarrhythmic : Dofetilide ↑ Dofetilide Coadministration is contraindicated with DOVATO [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Anticonvulsant : Carbamazepinea ↓ Dolutegravir An additional dolutegravir 50 - mg dose should be taken , separated by 12 hours from DOVATO [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Anticonvulsants : Oxcarbazepine Phenytoin Phenobarbital ↓ Dolutegravir Avoid coadministration with DOVATO because there are insufficient data to make dosing recommendations .
Antidiabetic : Metformina ↑ Metformin Refer to the prescribing information for metformin for assessing the benefit and risk of concomitant use of DOVATO and metformin .
Antimycobacterial : Rifampina ↓ Dolutegravir An additional 50 - mg dose of dolutegravir should be taken , separated by 12 hours from DOVATO [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Herbal product : St . John ’ s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) ↓ Dolutegravir Avoid coadministration with DOVATO because there are insufficient data to make dosing recommendations .
Medications containing polyvalent cations ( e . g . , Mg or Al ) : Cation - containing antacidsa or laxatives Sucralfate Buffered medications ↓ Dolutegravir Administer DOVATO 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking medications containing polyvalent cations .
Oral calcium and iron supplements , including multivitamins containing calcium or irona ↓ Dolutegravir When taken with food , DOVATO and supplements or multivitamins containing calcium or iron can be taken at the same time .
Under fasting conditions , DOVATO should be taken 2 hours before or 6 hours after taking supplements containing calcium or iron .
Potassium channel blocker : Dalfampridine ↑ Dalfampridine Elevated levels of dalfampridine increase the risk of seizures .
The potential benefits of taking dalfampridine concurrently with DOVATO should be considered against the risk of seizures in these patients .
Sorbitola ↓ Lamivudine When possible , avoid use of sorbitol - containing medicines with DOVATO .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Pregnancy : Assess the risks and benefits of DOVATO and discuss with the patient to determine if an alternative treatment should be considered at the time of conception through the first trimester or if pregnancy is confirmed in the first trimester due to the risk of neural tube defects .
( 2 . 1 , 5 . 4 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) • • Lactation : Breastfeeding is not recommended due to the potential for HIV - 1 transmission .
( 8 . 2 ) • • Females and males of reproductive potential : Pregnancy testing is recommended in individuals of childbearing potential .
Patients should be counseled on the consistent use of effective contraception .
( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) • • Renal impairment : DOVATO is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL / min .
( 8 . 6 ) • • Hepatic impairment : DOVATO is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Score C ) .
( 8 . 7 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to DOVATO during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry ( APR ) at 1 ‑ 800 ‑ 258 ‑ 4263 .
Risk Summary Data from an ongoing birth outcome surveillance study have identified an increased risk of neural tube defects when dolutegravir , a component of DOVATO , is administered at the time of conception .
As defects related to closure of the neural tube occur from conception through the first 6 weeks of gestation , embryos exposed to dolutegravir from the time of conception through the first 6 weeks of gestation are at potential risk .
Advise individuals of childbearing potential , including those actively trying to become pregnant , of the potential risk of neural tube defects with use of DOVATO .
Assess the risks and benefits of DOVATO and discuss with the patient to determine if an alternative treatment should be considered at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy or if pregnancy is confirmed in the first trimester .
A benefit - risk assessment should consider factors such as feasibility of switching to another antiretroviral regimen , tolerability , ability to maintain viral suppression , and risk of HIV - 1 transmission to the infant against the risk of neural tube defects associated with in utero dolutegravir exposure during critical periods of fetal development .
[ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
There are insufficient human data on the use of DOVATO during pregnancy to definitively assess a drug - associated risk for birth defects and miscarriage .
The background risk for major birth defects for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background rate for major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
In animal reproduction studies , no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed with dolutegravir at systemic exposures ( AUC ) less than ( rabbits ) and 50 times ( rats ) the exposure in humans at the recommended human dose ( RHD ) ( see Data ) .
Oral administration of lamivudine to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryolethality at systemic exposure ( AUC ) similar to the RHD ; however , no adverse developmental effects were observed with oral administration of lamivudine to pregnant rats during organogenesis at plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) 35 times the RHD ( see Data ) .
Data Human Data : Dolutegravir : In a birth outcome surveillance study in Botswana , there were 7 cases of neural tube defects reported out of 3 , 591 deliveries ( 0 . 19 % ) to women who were exposed to dolutegravir - containing regimens at the time of conception .
In comparison , the neural tube defect prevalence rates were 0 . 11 % ( 21 / 19 , 361 deliveries ) in the non - dolutegravir arm and 0 . 07 % ( 87 / 119 , 630 deliveries ) in the HIV - uninfected arm .
Seven cases reported with dolutegravir included 3 cases of myelomeningocele , 2 cases of encephalocele , and one case each of anencephaly and iniencephaly .
In the same study , no increased risk of neural tube defects was identified in women who started dolutegravir during pregnancy .
Two infants out of 4 , 448 ( 0 . 04 % ) deliveries to women who started dolutegravir during pregnancy had a neural tube defect , compared with 5 infants out of 6 , 748 ( 0 . 07 % ) deliveries to women who started non - dolutegravir - containing regimens during pregnancy .
The reported risks of neural tube defects by treatment groups were based on interim analyses from the ongoing surveillance study in Botswana .
It is unknown if baseline characteristics were balanced between the study treatment groups .
The observed trends of association could change as data accumulate .
Data analyzed to date from other sources including the APR , clinical trials , and postmarketing data are insufficient to definitively address the risk of neural tube defects with dolutegravir .
Data from the birth outcome surveillance study described above and postmarketing sources with more than 1 , 000 pregnancy outcomes from second and third trimester exposure in pregnant women indicate no evidence of increased risk of adverse birth outcomes .
Based on prospective reports to the APR of 842 exposures to dolutegravir during pregnancy resulting in live births ( including 512 exposed in the first trimester ) , the prevalence of defects in live births was 3 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 9 % to 5 . 3 % ) following first - trimester exposure to dolutegravir - containing regimens and 4 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : 2 . 8 % to 7 . 8 % ) following second - / third - trimester exposure to dolutegravir - containing regimens .
In the U . S . reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program ( MACDP ) , the background birth defect rate was 2 . 7 % .
Dolutegravir has been shown to cross the placenta .
In a clinical trial in Uganda and South Africa in women during the last trimester of pregnancy receiving dolutegravir 50 mg once daily , the ratio of median dolutegravir concentration in fetal umbilical cord to that in maternal peripheral plasma was 1 . 21 ( range 0 . 51 - 2 . 11 ) ( n = 15 ) .
Lamivudine : Based on prospective reports to the APR of exposures to lamivudine during pregnancy resulting in live births ( including over 5 , 300 exposed in the first trimester and over 7 , 400 exposed in the second / third trimester ) , there was no difference between the overall risk of birth defects for lamivudine compared with the background birth defect rate of 2 . 7 % in the U . S . reference population of the MACDP .
The prevalence of defects in live births was 3 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 2 . 7 % to 3 . 6 % ) following first trimester exposure to lamivudine - containing regimens and 2 . 9 % ( 95 % CI : 2 . 5 % to 3 . 3 % ) following second / third trimester exposure to lamivudine - containing regimens .
Lamivudine pharmacokinetics were studied in pregnant women during 2 clinical trials conducted in South Africa .
The trials assessed pharmacokinetics in 16 women at 36 weeks ’ gestation using lamivudine 150 mg twice daily with zidovudine , 10 women at 38 weeks ’ gestation using lamivudine 150 mg twice daily with zidovudine , and 10 women at 38 weeks ’ gestation using lamivudine 300 mg twice daily without other antiretrovirals .
These trials were not designed or powered to provide efficacy information .
Lamivudine concentrations were generally similar in maternal , neonatal , and umbilical cord serum samples .
In a subset of subjects , amniotic fluid specimens were collected following natural rupture of membranes and confirmed that lamivudine crosses the placenta in humans .
Based on limited data at delivery , median ( range ) amniotic fluid concentrations of lamivudine were 3 . 9 - fold ( 1 . 2 - to 12 . 8 - fold ) greater compared with paired maternal serum concentration ( n = 8 ) .
Animal Data : Dolutegravir : Dolutegravir was administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits ( up to 1 , 000 mg / kg / day ) on Gestation Days 6 to 17 and 6 to 18 , respectively , and also to rats on Gestation Day 6 to Lactation / Postpartum Day 20 .
No adverse effects on embryo - fetal ( rats and rabbits ) or pre / postnatal ( rats ) development were observed up to the highest dose tested .
During organogenesis , systemic exposures ( AUC ) to dolutegravir in rabbits were less than the exposure in humans at the RHD and in rats were approximately 50 times the exposure in humans at the RHD .
In the rat pre / postnatal development study , decreased body weight of the developing offspring was observed during lactation at a maternally toxic dose ( approximately 50 times human exposure at the RHD ) .
Lamivudine : Lamivudine was administered orally to pregnant rats ( at 90 , 600 , and 4 , 000 mg / kg / day ) and rabbits ( at 90 , 300 and 1 , 000 mg / kg / day and at 15 , 40 , and 90 mg / kg / day ) during organogenesis ( on Gestation Days 7 through 16 [ rat ] and 8 through 20 [ rabbit ] ) .
No evidence of fetal malformations due to lamivudine was observed in rats and rabbits at doses producing plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) approximately 35 times higher than human exposure at the RHD .
Evidence of early embryolethality was seen in the rabbit at systemic exposures ( AUC ) similar to those observed in humans , but there was no indication of this effect in the rat at plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) 35 times higher than human exposure at the RHD .
Studies in pregnant rats showed that lamivudine is transferred to the fetus through the placenta .
In the fertility / pre - and postnatal development study in rats , lamivudine was administered orally at doses of 180 , 900 , and 4 , 000 mg / kg / day ( from prior to mating through Postnatal Day 20 ) .
In the study , development of the offspring , including fertility and reproductive performance , was not affected by the maternal administration of lamivudine .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV ‑ 1 – infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV ‑ 1 infection .
Dolutegravir and lamivudine are present in human milk .
There is no information on the effects of DOVATO or the components of DOVATO on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drugs on milk production .
Because of the potential for ( 1 ) HIV ‑ 1 transmission ( in HIV - negative infants ) , ( 2 ) developing viral resistance ( in HIV - positive infants ) , and ( 3 ) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant similar to those seen in adults , instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving DOVATO .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential In individuals of childbearing potential currently on DOVATO who are actively trying to become pregnant or if pregnancy is confirmed in the first trimester , assess the risks and benefits of continuing DOVATO and discuss with the patient if an alternative treatment should be considered [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended in individuals of childbearing potential before initiation of DOVATO [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception Individuals of childbearing potential who are taking DOVATO should be counseled on the consistent use of effective contraception .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of DOVATO have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of DOVATO did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , caution should be exercised in the administration of DOVATO in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment DOVATO is not recommended for patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min because DOVATO is a fixed - dose combination and the dosage of the individual components cannot be adjusted .
If a dose reduction of lamivudine , a component of DOVATO , is required for patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min , then the individual components should be used .
Patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL / min receiving DOVATO may experience a 1 . 6 - to 3 . 3 - fold higher lamivudine exposure ( AUC ) than patients with a creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL / min .
There are no safety data from randomized , controlled trials comparing DOVATO to the individual components in patients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL / min who received dose - adjusted lamivudine .
In the original lamivudine registrational trials in combination with zidovudine , higher lamivudine exposures were associated with higher rates of hematologic toxicities ( neutropenia and anemia ) , although discontinuations due to neutropenia or anemia each occurred in < 1 % of subjects .
Patients with a sustained creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL / min who receive DOVATO should be monitored for hematologic toxicities .
If new or worsening neutropenia or anemia develop , dose adjustment of lamivudine , per lamivudine prescribing information , is recommended .
If lamivudine dose adjustment is indicated , DOVATO should be discontinued and the individual components should be used to construct the treatment regimen .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment of DOVATO is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Score A or B ) .
Dolutegravir has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Score C ) ; therefore , DOVATO is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known specific treatment for overdose with DOVATO .
If overdose occurs , the patient should be monitored and standard supportive treatment applied as required .
Dolutegravir As dolutegravir is highly bound to plasma proteins , it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by dialysis .
Lamivudine Because a negligible amount of lamivudine was removed via ( 4 - hour ) hemodialysis , continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis , and automated peritoneal dialysis , it is not known if continuous hemodialysis would provide clinical benefit in a lamivudine overdose event .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action DOVATO is a fixed - dose combination of the HIV ‑ 1 antiretroviral agents , dolutegravir and lamivudine [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of combination therapy as DOVATO or lamivudine given alone on the QT interval has not been studied .
At a 250 - mg suspension dose ( exposures approximately 3 – fold that of the 50 - mg once - daily dose at steady state ) , dolutegravir given alone did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent .
Effects of Dolutegravir on Renal Function No clinically significant dolutegravir exposure - response relationship on the glomerular filtration rate or effective renal plasma flow was observed .
The effect of dolutegravir on renal function was evaluated in an open - label , randomized , 3 - arm , parallel , placebo - controlled trial in healthy subjects ( n = 37 ) who received dolutegravir 50 mg once daily ( n = 12 ) , dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily ( n = 13 ) , or placebo once daily ( n = 12 ) for 14 days .

12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Dolutegravir : Dolutegravir inhibits HIV integrase by binding to the integrase active site and blocking the strand transfer step of retroviral DNA integration which is essential for the HIV replication cycle .
Strand transfer biochemical assays using purified recombinant HIV ‑ 1 integrase and pre - processed substrate DNA resulted in IC50 values of 2 . 7 nM and 12 . 6 nM .
Lamivudine : Lamivudine is a synthetic nucleoside analogue .
Intracellularly lamivudine is phosphorylated to its active 5 ′ - triphosphate metabolite , lamivudine triphosphate ( 3 TC ‑ TP ) .
The principal mode of action of 3 TC ‑ TP is inhibition of reverse transcriptase ( RT ) via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleotide analogue .
Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Dolutegravir : Dolutegravir exhibited antiviral activity against laboratory strains of wild - type HIV ‑ 1 with mean concentrations of drug necessary to affect viral replication by 50 percent ( EC50 ) values of 0 . 5 nM ( 0 . 21 ng / mL ) to 2 . 1 nM ( 0 . 85 ng / mL ) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) and MT - 4 cells .
Dolutegravir exhibited antiviral activity against 13 clinically diverse clade B isolates with a mean EC50 value of 0 . 52 nM in a viral integrase susceptibility assay using the integrase coding region from clinical isolates .
Dolutegravir demonstrated antiviral activity in cell culture against a panel of HIV - 1 clinical isolates ( 3 in each group of M [ clades A - G ] , and 3 in group O ) with EC50 values ranging from 0 . 02 nM to 2 . 14 nM for HIV - 1 .
Dolutegravir EC50 values against three HIV - 2 clinical isolates in PBMC assays ranged from 0 . 09 nM to 0 . 61 nM .
Lamivudine : The antiviral activity of lamivudine against HIV ‑ 1 was assessed in a number of cell lines including monocytes and PBMCs using standard susceptibility assays .
EC50 values were in the range of 3 to 15 , 000 nM ( 1 nM = 0 . 23 ng / mL ) .
The EC50 values of lamivudine against different HIV - 1 clades ( A - G ) and group O viruses ranged from 1 to 120 nM , and against HIV - 2 isolates from 3 to 120 nM in PBMCs .
Antiviral Activity in Combination with Other Antiviral Agents Neither dolutegravir nor lamivudine were antagonistic to all tested anti - HIV agents .
Resistance Cell Culture : Dolutegravir : Dolutegravir - resistant viruses were selected in cell culture starting from different wild - type HIV ‑ 1 strains and clades .
Amino acid substitutions emerged in different passages ; the substitution G118R emergence conferred decreased susceptibility to dolutegravir of 10 - fold , while substitutions E92Q , S153F or Y , G193E , or R263K conferred decreased susceptibility to dolutegravir of up to 4 - fold .
Lamivudine : HIV - 1 resistance to lamivudine involves the development of a M184V or M184I amino acid change close to the active site of the viral RT .
This variant arises both in cell culture and in HIV - 1 – infected patients treated with lamivudine - containing antiretroviral therapy .
Substitutions M184V or I confer high - level resistance to lamivudine .
Clinical Subjects : At Week 144 , none of the 12 subjects in the dolutegravir plus lamivudine group or the 9 subjects in the dolutegravir plus TDF / FTC group who met the protocol - defined confirmed virologic withdrawal criteria across the pooled GEMINI - 1 and GEMINI - 2 trials had emergent INSTI - or NRTI - resistance substitutions .
No subject who received DOVATO in the TANGO trial met the protocol - defined confirmed virologic withdrawal criteria through Week 144 .
No emergent INSTI - or NRTI - resistance was detected by genotypic or phenotypic analyses of the last on - treatment isolate from one subject who received DOVATO with HIV - 1 RNA ≥ 400 copies / mL at withdrawal .
No emergent resistance was detected by genotypic or phenotypic analyses of HIV - 1 integrase , protease , or reverse transcriptase at the time of virologic failure in 3 subjects in the TBR arm who met the confirmed virologic withdrawal criteria .
Cross - Resistance Dolutegravir : The susceptibility of dolutegravir was tested against 60 INSTI - resistant site - directed mutant HIV - 1 viruses ( 28 with single substitutions and 32 with 2 or more substitutions ) .
The single INSTI - resistance substitutions T66K , I151L , and S153Y conferred a > 2 - fold decrease in dolutegravir susceptibility ( range : 2 . 3 - fold to 3 . 6 - fold from reference ) .
Combinations of multiple substitutions T66K / L74M ; E92Q / N155H ; G140C / Q148R ; G140S / Q148H , R or K ; Q148R / N155H ; T97A / G140S / Q148 , and substitutions at E138 / G140 / Q148 showed a > 2 - fold decrease in dolutegravir susceptibility ( range : 2 . 5 - fold to 21 - fold from reference ) .
Lamivudine : Cross - resistance conferred by the M184V or I RT has been observed within the NRTI class of antiretroviral agents .
The M184V or I substitution confers resistance to emtricitabine and to abacavir , which selects M184V or I plus additional RT substitutions K65R , L74V , and Y115F .
Zidovudine maintains its antiretroviral activities against lamivudine - resistant HIV - 1 .
Abacavir and tenofovir maintain antiretroviral activity against lamivudine - resistant HIV - 1 harboring only the M184V or I substitution .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Dolutegravir : Two - year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats were conducted with dolutegravir .
Mice were administered doses of up to 500 mg / kg , and rats were administered doses of up to 50 mg / kg .
In mice , no significant increases in the incidence of drug - related neoplasms were observed at the highest doses tested , resulting in dolutegravir AUC exposures approximately 26 times higher than those in humans at the recommended dose .
In rats , no increases in the incidence of drug - related neoplasms were observed at the highest dose tested , resulting in dolutegravir AUC exposures 17 times higher than those in humans at the recommended dose .
Lamivudine : Long ‑ term carcinogenicity studies with lamivudine in mice and rats showed no evidence of carcinogenic potential at exposures up to 12 times ( mice ) and 57 times ( rats ) the human exposures at the recommended dose .
Mutagenicity Dolutegravir : Dolutegravir was not genotoxic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay , in a mouse lymphoma assay , or in the in vivo rodent micronucleus assay .
Lamivudine : Lamivudine was mutagenic in an L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay and clastogenic in a cytogenetic assay using cultured human lymphocytes .
Lamivudine was not mutagenic in a microbial mutagenicity assay , in an in vitro cell transformation assay , in a rat micronucleus test , in a rat bone marrow cytogenetic assay , and in an assay for unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat liver .
Impairment of Fertility Dolutegravir or lamivudine did not affect male or female fertility in rats at doses associated with exposures approximately 44 or 112 times , respectively , higher than the exposures in humans at the recommended dose .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Description of Clinical Trials The efficacy of DOVATO is supported by data from 2 randomized , double - blind , controlled trials ( GEMINI - 1 [ NCT02831673 ] and GEMINI - 2 [ NCT02831764 ] ) in HIV - 1 – infected adults with no antiretroviral treatment history , and data from a randomized , open - label , controlled trial ( TANGO [ NCT03446573 ] ) in virologically suppressed HIV - 1 – infected adults .
14 . 2 Clinical Trial Results in HIV - 1 – Infected Adult Subjects with No Antiretroviral Treatment History GEMINI - 1 and GEMINI - 2 are identical 148 - week , Phase 3 , randomized , multicenter , parallel - group , non - inferiority trials .
A total of 1 , 433 HIV - 1 – infected adults with no antiretroviral treatment history received treatment in the trials .
Subjects were enrolled with a screening plasma HIV - 1 RNA of 1 , 000 to ≤ 500 , 000 copies / mL and without evidence of major resistance - associated mutations or evidence of HBV infection .
Subjects were randomized to receive a 2 - drug regimen of TIVICAY 50 mg plus EPIVIR 300 mg administered once daily or TIVICAY 50 mg plus fixed - dose TRUVADA administered once daily .
The primary efficacy endpoint for each GEMINI trial was the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV - 1 RNA < 50 copies / mL at Week 48 ( Snapshot algorithm ) who were randomized and treated .
At baseline , in the pooled analysis , the median age of subjects was 33 years , 15 % female , 69 % white , 9 % were CDC Stage 3 ( AIDS ) , the median plasma HIV - 1 RNA was 4 . 4 log10 copies / mL , 20 % had HIV - 1 RNA > 100 , 000 copies / mL , the median CD4 + cell count was 432 cells / mm3 , and 8 % had CD4 + cell count ≤ 200 cells / mm3 ; these characteristics were similar between trials and treatment arms within each trial .
Week 144 outcomes ( including outcomes by key baseline covariates ) for the pooled GEMINI - 1 and GEMINI - 2 trials are shown in Table 11 .
The results of the pooled analysis are consistent with the results from the individual trials , for which the secondary endpoint is the difference in proportion of subjects with plasma HIV - 1 RNA < 50 copies / mL at Week 144 based on the Snapshot algorithm for TIVICAY plus EPIVIR versus TIVICAY plus TRUVADA .
The proportions of subjects with plasma HIV - 1 RNA < 50 copies / mL in the group receiving TIVICAY plus EPIVIR versus TIVICAY plus TRUVADA were 79 % and 83 % , respectively , in GEMINI ‑ 1 and 84 % in both treatment arms of GEMINI - 2 .
The adjusted difference was - 3 . 6 % ( 95 % CI : - 9 . 4 % , 2 . 1 ) for GEMINI - 1 and 0 . 0 % ( 95 % CI : - 5 . 3 % , 5 . 3 % ) for GEMINI - 2 .
At Week 144 , no subjects who met the protocol - defined confirmed virologic withdrawal criteria had any treatment - emergent substitutions associated with resistance to dolutegravir or NRTIs .

The adjusted mean change from baseline in CD4 + cell count based on the pooled analysis at Week 144 was 302 cells / mm3 for the group receiving TIVICAY plus EPIVIR and 300 cells / mm3 for the group receiving TIVICAY plus TRUVADA .
14 . 3 Clinical Trial Results in HIV - 1 – Infected Virologically Suppressed Adult Subjects Who Switched to DOVATO The efficacy of DOVATO in HIV - 1 – infected , antiretroviral treatment - experienced , virologically suppressed subjects is supported by data from a 200 - week , Phase 3 , randomized , open - label , multicenter , parallel - group , non - inferiority controlled trial ( TANGO ) .
A total of 741 adult HIV - 1 – infected subjects who were on a stable suppressive TBR received treatment in the trial .
Subjects were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive DOVATO once daily or continue with their TBR for up to 148 weeks ; at Week 148 , the subjects randomized to continue with their TBR were switched to DOVATO once daily .
All subjects are followed up to Week 200 .
Randomization was stratified by baseline third - agent class ( protease inhibitor [ PI ] , INSTI , or non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [ NNRTI ] ) .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV - 1 RNA ≥ 50 copies / mL ( virologic non - response ) at Week 48 ( Snapshot algorithm adjusting for randomization stratification factor ) .
At baseline , the median age of subjects was 39 years , 8 % were female , 21 % non - white , 5 % were CDC Class C ( AIDS ) , and 98 % of subjects had baseline CD4 + cell count ≥ 200 cells / mm3 ; these characteristics were similar between treatment arms .
Subjects receiving DOVATO and a TBR had been on an antiretroviral regimen for a median of 2 . 8 and 2 . 9 years , respectively , prior to Day 1 .
Most subjects were on an integrase inhibitor - based TBR ( 78 % and 80 % of subjects who received DOVATO and a TBR , respectively ) .
In the primary 48 week analysis , < 1 % of subjects in both arms experienced virologic failure ( HIV - 1 RNA ≥ 50 copies / mL ) at Week 48 based on the Snapshot algorithm .
Based on a 4 % non - inferiority margin , DOVATO was non - inferior to TBR in the primary analysis ( proportion of subjects with plasma HIV - 1 RNA ≥ 50 copies / mL ) , as the upper bound of the 95 % CI for the adjusted treatment difference ( - 1 . 2 % , 0 . 7 % ) was less than 4 % .
At Week 144 , the proportion of subjects with HIV - 1 RNA ≥ 50 copies / mL ( Snapshot ) was 0 . 3 % and 1 . 3 % in the DOVATO and TBR treatment arms , respectively ( Table 12 ) .

a Based on a 4 % non - inferiority margin , DOVATO is non - inferior to TBR at Week 48 in the primary analysis ( proportion of subjects with plasma HIV - 1 RNA ≥ 50 copies / mL ) because the upper bound of the 95 % CI for the adjusted treatment difference is less than 4 % .
b Based on Cochran – Mantel – Haenszel - stratified analysis adjusting for baseline third - agent class ( PI , INSTI , or NNRTI ) .
The other Snapshot outcomes ( HIV - 1 RNA < 50 copies / mL and no virologic data in the visit window ) were combined into a single category for the analysis , and subjects who had no virologic data at Week 144 were assumed to have virologic response ( < 50 copies / mL ) .
c At Week 144 in the secondary analysis ( proportion of subjects achieving plasma HIV - 1 RNA < 50 copies / mL ) , the adjusted treatment difference was 4 . 2 % ( 95 % CI : - 1 . 1 % , 9 . 5 % ) .

DVT : 11 PI PATIENT INFORMATION DOVATO ( doe VAH toe ) ( dolutegravir and lamivudine ) tablets What is the most important information I should know about DOVATO ?
If you have both human immunodeficiency virus - 1 ( HIV - 1 ) infection and Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection , DOVATO can cause serious side effects , including : • • Resistant HBV .
Your healthcare provider will test you for HBV infection before you start treatment with DOVATO .
If you have HIV - 1 and hepatitis B , the HBV can change ( mutate ) during your treatment with DOVATO and become harder to treat ( resistant ) .
It is not known if DOVATO is safe and effective in people who have HIV - 1 and HBV infection .
• • Worsening of HBV infection .
If you have HBV infection and take DOVATO , your HBV may get worse ( flare - up ) if you stop taking DOVATO .
A “ flare - up ” is when your HBV infection suddenly returns in a worse way than before .
• oDo not run out of DOVATO .
Refill your prescription or talk to your healthcare provider before your DOVATO is all gone .
• oDo not stop DOVATO without first talking to your healthcare provider .
• oIf you stop taking DOVATO , your healthcare provider will need to check your health often and do blood tests regularly for several months to check your liver function and monitor your HBV infection .
It may be necessary to give you a medicine to treat hepatitis B . Tell your healthcare provider about any new or unusual symptoms you may have after you stop taking DOVATO .
For more information about side effects , see “ What are the possible side effects of DOVATO ? ”
What is DOVATO ?
DOVATO is a prescription medicine that is used without other HIV - 1 medicines to treat HIV - 1 infection in adults : • • who have not received HIV - 1 medicines in the past , or • • to replace their current HIV - 1 medicines when their healthcare provider determines that they meet certain requirements .
HIV - 1 is the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
It is not known if DOVATO is safe and effective in children .
Do not take DOVATO if you : • • have ever had an allergic reaction to a medicine that contains dolutegravir or lamivudine .
See the end of this Patient Information for a complete list of ingredients in DOVATO .
• • take dofetilide .
Taking DOVATO and dofetilide can cause side effects that may be serious or life - threatening .
Before you take DOVATO , tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions , including if you : • • have or have had liver problems , including hepatitis B or C infection .
• • have kidney problems .

• Pregnancy Registry .
There is a pregnancy registry for individuals who take DOVATO during pregnancy .
The purpose of this registry is to collect information about the health of you and your baby .
Talk with your healthcare provider about how you can take part in this registry .
• • are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed .
Do not breastfeed if you take DOVATO .
• oYou should not breastfeed if you have HIV - 1 because of the risk of passing HIV - 1 to your baby .
• oDOVATO passes to your baby in your breast milk .
• oTalk with your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby .
Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take , including prescription and over - the - counter medicines , vitamins , and herbal supplements .
Some medicines interact with DOVATO .
Keep a list of your medicines and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine .
• • You can ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for a list of medicines that interact with DOVATO .
• • Do not start taking a new medicine without telling your healthcare provider .
Your healthcare provider can tell you if it is safe to take DOVATO with other medicines .
How should I take DOVATO ?
