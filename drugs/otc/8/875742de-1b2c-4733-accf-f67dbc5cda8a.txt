Visual inspection was performed to identify the blue - labeled nodes and a hand held gamma counter was used to identify nodes concentrating the radiopharmaceutical .
Multiple methods were used to detect the concentrated radioactivity within lymph nodes .
For example , investigators used thresholds of background radioactivity to localize nodes containing a minimum of radioactive counts 3 times higher than the background or containing at least 10 fold higher counts than contiguous nodes .
• • In clinical studies of patients with malignant melanoma , preoperative lymphoscintigraphy was usually performed using planar imaging techniques to establish a road map of nodal basins and to facilitate intraoperative identification of lymph nodes .
[ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] • • Technetium Tc 99 m Sulfur Colloid Injection and other tracers may not localize all lymph nodes and the tracers may differ in their extent of lymph node localization .
The lymph node localization of Technetium Tc 99 m Sulfur Colloid Injection is dependent upon the underlying patency and structure of the lymphatic system , the extent of functional reticuloendothelial cells within lymph nodes and the radiopharmaceutical injection technique .
Distortion of the underlying lymphatic system architecture and function by prior surgery , radiation or extensive metastatic disease may result in failure of the radiopharmaceutical and other tracers to localize lymph nodes .
The use of Technetium Tc 99 m Sulfur Colloid Injection is intended to supplement palpation , visual inspection and other procedures important to lymph node localization .
[ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
• Peritoneo - venous ( LeVeen ) shunt setting in adults : Following administration of Technetium Tc 99 m Sulfur Colloid Injection into the peritoneal cavity , the radiopharmaceutical mixes with the peritoneal fluid .
Clearance from the peritoneal cavity varies from insignificant , which may occur with complete shunt blockage , to very rapid clearance with subsequent transfer into the systemic circulation when the shunt is patent .
Following transfer into the systemic circulation , the radiopharmaceutical concentrates within the liver ( a target organ ) .
Obtain serial images of both the shunt and liver .
An adequate evaluation of the difference between total blockage of the shunt and partial blockage may not be feasible in all cases .
Transperitoneal absorption of sulfur colloid into the systemic circulation may occur , but it occurs slowly .
Therefore , the most definitive scintigraphic evaluation of shunt patency will generally be obtained if there is visualization of both the shunt itself and the liver and / or spleen within the first three hours post intraperitoneal injection of the radiopharmaceutical .
• Imaging areas of functioning reticuloendothelial cells in liver , spleen or bone marrow : Altered biodistribution with lung and soft tissue uptake instead of reticuloendothelial system has been reported after intravenous injection .
The size and physical - chemical properties of the sulfur colloid particles formed from the components of the kit may determine the biodistribution of the colloid and its uptake by the reticuloendothelial system .
Diseases affecting the reticuloendothelial system may also alter the expected uptake pattern .
• Gastroesophageal and pulmonary aspiration imaging studies : To facilitate the imaging of gastroesophageal reflux consider administering Sulfur Colloid by nasogastric tube .

DOE / TIC - 11026 : 108 , 1981 11 . 2 External Radiation The specific gamma ray constant for Tc 99 m is 0 . 78 R / millicurie - hr at 1 cm .
The first half - value layer is 0 . 017 cm of lead ( Pb ) .
A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 8 .
For example , the use of a 0 . 25 cm thickness of Pb will attenuate the radiation emitted by a factor of about 1 , 000 .

[ see Description ( 11 . 1 ) ] Following subcutaneous injection , Technetium Tc 99 m Sulfur Colloid enters the lymphatic capillaries and is transported with lymph to lymph nodes .
However , when there is massive nodal metastatic involvement , the normal transport to lymph nodes is lost because few normal cells remain in the node .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] Following intraperitoneal injection , Technetium Tc 99 m Sulfur Colloid mixes with the peritoneal fluid ; rate of clearance from the cavity allows assessment of the patency of the shunt .
Clearance varies from insignificant , which may occur with complete shunt blockage , to very rapid clearance with subsequent transfer into the systemic circulation when the shunt is patent .
Following intravenous injection , Technetium Tc 99 m Sulfur Colloid is taken up by the reticuloendothelial system ( RES ) , allowing RES rich structures to be imaged .
With oral administration , Technetium Tc 99 m Sulfur Colloid is not absorbed accounting for its function in esophageal transit studies , gastroesophageal reflux scintigraphy , and for the detection of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous administration , Technetium Tc 99 m Sulfur Colloid Injection is rapidly cleared from the blood by the reticuloendothelial system with a nominal half - life of approximately 2 1 / 2 minutes .
Uptake of the radioactive colloid by organs of the RES is dependent upon both their relative blood flow rates and the functional capacity of the phagocytic cells .
In the average patient 80 to 90 % of the injected collodial particles are phagocytized by the Kupffer cells of the liver , 5 to 10 % by the spleen and the balance by the bone marrow .
Following oral ingestion , Technetium Tc 99 m Sulfur Colloid is distributed primarily through the gastrointestinal tract with elimination primarily through the feces .

14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Tracer Localization to Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer A systematic review of 43 publications examined procedures that used the injection of Technetium Tc 99 m Sulfur Colloid Injection and a blue dye ( tracers ) to assist surgeons in the localization of lymph nodes among patients with a primary breast cancer lesion .
From these publications , 15 studies were identified for inclusion within a meta - analysis , based upon the following criteria : prospective design , minimum number of 50 lymph node localization procedures , and paired outcome data available for both Technetium Tc 99 m Sulfur Colloid Injection and blue dye .
Within these studies , the number of procedures ranged from 62 to 6 , 197 ; in general one procedure involved a single patient but in some uncommon situations , one patient underwent more than one procedure .
The patients received subcutaneous Technetium Tc 99 m Sulfur Colloid Injection doses ranging between 0 . 1 and 2 mCi .
The mean age of patients ranged from 52 to 60 years , and almost all were female .
Lymph nodes that contained radioactivity were generally localized based upon increased counts , in comparison to a background threshold ( e . g . , nodes containing a minimum of radioactive counts 3 times higher than background or containing at least 10 fold higher counts than contiguous nodes ) .
Radioactivity was measured using a handheld gamma counter .
Table 10 shows the tracer localization rates where the tracer localization rate ( % ) is defined as the percentage of procedures which had at least one lymph node containing the specific tracer .
Random effect meta - analytic measures were used for estimating various rates of tracer localization by procedure along with the respective confidence intervals .
The random effect meta - analytical methods take into account the sample size of each study as well as within and between study variability .
In general , most procedures involved the resection of lymph nodes in which a tracer had localized to at least one node .
However , in some procedures ( estimated at approximately 3 . 4 % ) neither tracer was localized to a resected lymph node .
The reports were insufficient to establish the basis for failed tracer localization .

** 95 % Confidence Intervals are based on meta - analysis and represent the spread in the individual estimates .
In some of the publications , different methods of Technetium Tc 99 m Sulfur Colloid Injection administration were compared : intradermal ( ID ) , subareolar ( SA ) and intraparenchymal ( IP ) methods .
Generally , more favorable results were seen using the ID and SA routes , with less favorable results reported when surgeons used the IP method .
14 . 2 Tracer Localization to Lymph Nodes in Malignant Melanoma A systematic review of eight publications examined the use of Technetium Tc 99 m Sulfur Colloid and a blue dye ( tracers ) to assist surgeons in the localization of lymph nodes among patients with malignant melanoma .
A meta - analysis was performed using data from the studies that reported the resected lymph node content of Technetium Tc 99 m Sulfur Colloid Injection and blue dye .
Four of the eight publications met this criterion and were included in the meta - analysis .
Within these four studies , the number of reported patients ranged from 12 to 94 .
The patients received subcutaneous Technetium Tc 99 m Sulfur Colloid Injection doses ranging between 0 . 25 to 2 mCi .
The patients were aged 15 to 89 years and most ( 53 to 70 % ) were male .
Lymph nodes that contained radioactivity were generally localized based upon increased counts , in comparison to a background threshold ( e . g . , nodes containing a minimum of radioactive counts 3 times higher than background ) .
Radioactivity was measured using a handheld gamma counter .
Table 11 shows the tracer localization rates where the tracer localization rate ( % ) is defined as the percentage of patients who had at least one lymph node containing the specific tracer .
Random effect meta - analytic measures were used for estimating the various rates of tracer localization by patient along with the respective confidence intervals .
The random effect meta - analytical methods take into account the sample size of each study as well as within and between study variability .
In general , most patients had resected lymph nodes that contained at least one of the tracers .
However , in some patients ( estimated at approximately 1 . 6 % ) neither tracer was localized to a resected lymph node .
The reports were insufficient to establish the basis for failed tracer localization .
