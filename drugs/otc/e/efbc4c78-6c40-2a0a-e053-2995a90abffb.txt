HYOSCYAMINE SULFATE is an alkaloid of belladonna .
Exists as a white crystalline powder .
Affected by light It is very soluble in water ; freely soluble in alcohol ; practically insoluble in ether .
METHENAMINE exists as colorless , lustrous crystals or white crystalline powder .
Its solutions are alkaline to litmus .
Freely soluble in water ; soluble in alcohol and in chloroform .
METHYLENE BLUE exists as dark green crystals .
It is soluble in water and in chloroform ; sparingly soluble in alcohol .
MONOBASIC SODIUM PHOSPHATE exists as a white crystalline powder .
Its solutions are acidic to litmus .
It is freely soluble in water and practically insoluble in alcohol .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY HYOSCYAMINE is a parasympatholytic which relaxes smooth muscles and thus produces an antispasmodic effect .
It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is rapidly distributed throughout body tissues .
Most is excreted in the urine within 12 hours , 13 % to 50 % being unchanged .
Its biotransformation is hepatic .
Its protein binding is moderate .
METHENAMINE degrades in an acidic urine environment releasing formaldehyde which provides bactericidal or bacteriostatic action .
It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract .
70 % to 90 % reaches the urine unchanged at which point it is hydrolyzed if the urine is acidic .
Within 24 hours it is almost completely ( 90 % ) excreted ; of this amount at pH 5 , approximately 20 % is formaldehyde .
Protein binding : some formaldehyde is bound to substances in the urine and surrounding tissues .
Methenamine is freely distributed to body tissue and fluids but is not clinically significant as it does not hydrolyze at pH greater than 6 . 8 .
METHYLENE BLUE possesses weak antiseptic properties .
It is well absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and is rapidly reduced to leukomethylene blue which is stabilized in some combination form in the urine .
75 % is excreted unchanged .
MONOBASIC SODIUM PHOSPHATE helps to maintain an acid pH in the urine necessary for the degradation of methenamine .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE UROGESIC - BLUE ™ is indicated for the treatment of symptoms of irritative voiding .
Indicated for the relief of local symptoms , such as hypermotility which accompany lower urinary tract infections and as antispasmodic .
Indicated for the relief of urinary tract symptoms caused by diagnostic procedures .

Risk - benefit should be considered when the following medical problems exist : Cardiac disease ( especially cardiac arrythmias , congestive heart failure , coronary heart disease , mitral stenosis ) ; gastrointestinal tract obstructive disease ; glaucoma ; myasthenia gravis ; acute urinary retention may be precipitated in obstructive uropathy ( such as bladder neck obstruction due to prostatic hypertrophy ) .
WARNINGS Do not exceed recommended dosage .
If rapid pulse , dizziness , or blurring of vision occurs discontinue use immediately .
PRECAUTIONS Cross sensitivity and / or related problems patients intolerant of belladonna alkaloids may be intolerant of this medication also .
Pregnancy / Reproduction ( Pregnancy Category C ) hyoscyamine and methenamine cross the placenta .

UROGESIC - BLUE ™ tablets should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Breast - feeding problems in humans have not been documented ; however , methenamine and traces of hyoscyamine are excreted in breast milk .
Prolonged use there have been no studies to establish the safety of prolonged use in humans .
No known long - term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential .
Pediatric infants and young children are especially susceptible to the toxic effect of the belladonna alkaloids .
Geriatric use with caution in elderly patients as they may respond to usual doses of hyoscyamine with excitement , agitation , drowsiness , or confusion .
Drug Interactions because of this product ' s effect on gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying , it may decrease the absorption of other oral medications during concurrent use such as : urinary alkalizers ; thiazide diuretics ( may cause the urine to become alkaline reducing the effectiveness of methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde ) ; antimuscarinics ( concurrent use may intensify antimuscarinic effects of hyoscyamine because of secondary antimuscarinic activities of these medications ) ; antacids / antidiarrheals ( may reduce absorption of hyoscyamine , concurrent use with antacids may cause urine to become alkaline reducing effectiveness of methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde ) doses of these medications should be spaced 1 hour apart from doses of hyoscyamine ; antimyasthenics ( concurrent use with hyoscyamine may further reduce intestinal motility ) ; ketoconazole ( patients should be advised to take this combination at least 2 hours after ketoconazole ) ; monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) Inhibitors ( concurrent use may intensify antimuscarinic side effects , opoid ( narcotic ) analgesics may result in increased risk of severe constipation ) ; sulfonamides ( these drugs may precipitate with formaldehyde in the urine , increasing the danger of crystalluria ) .
Patients should be advised that the urine may become blue to blue green and the feces may be discolored as a result of the excretion of methylene blue .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Cardiovascular – rapid pulse , flushing Central Nervous System – blurred vision , dizziness Respiratory – shortness of breath or troubled breathing Genitourinary – difficulty micturition , acute urinary retention Gastrointestinal – dry mouth , nausea / vomiting DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE A dependence on the use of UROGESIC - BLUE ™ has not been reported and due to the nature of its ingredients , abuse of UROGESIC - BLUE ™ is not expected .
