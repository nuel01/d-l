It has no direct action on the contractile mechanism of striated muscle , the motor end plate or the nerve fiber .
Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers , the plasma clearance of methocarbamol ranges between 0 . 20 and 0 . 80 L / h / kg , the mean plasma elimination half - life ranges between 1 and 2 hours , and the plasma protein binding ranges between 46 % and 50 % .
Methocarbamol is metabolized via dealkylation and hydroxylation .
Conjugation of methocarbamol also is likely .
Essentially all methocarbamol metabolites are eliminated in the urine .
Small amounts of unchanged methocarbamol also are excreted in the urine .
Special populations Elderly The mean ( ± SD ) elimination half - life of methocarbamol in elderly healthy volunteers ( mean ( ± SD ) age , 69 ( ± 4 ) years ) was slightly prolonged compared to a younger ( mean ( ± SD ) age , 53 . 3 ( ± 8 . 8 ) years ) , healthy population ( 1 . 5 ( ± 0 . 4 ) hours versus 1 . 1 ( ± 0 . 27 ) hours , respectively ) .
The fraction of bound methocarbamol was slightly decreased in the elderly versus younger volunteers ( 41 to 43 % versus 46 to 50 % , respectively ) .
Renally impaired The clearance of methocarbamol in 8 renally - impaired patients on maintenance hemodialysis was reduced about 40 % compared to 17 normal subjects , although the mean ( ± SD ) elimination half - life in these two groups was similar : 1 . 2 ( ± 0 . 6 ) versus 1 . 1 ( ± 0 . 3 ) hours , respectively .
Hepatically impaired In 8 patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse , the mean total clearance of methocarbamol was reduced approximately 70 % compared to that obtained in 8 age - and weight - matched normal subjects .
The mean ( ± SD ) elimination half - life in the cirrhotic patients and the normal subjects was 3 . 38 ( ± 1 . 62 ) hours and 1 . 11 ( ± 0 . 27 ) hours , respectively .
The percent of methocarbamol bound to plasma proteins was decreased to approximately 40 to 45 % compared to 46 to 50 % in the normal subjects .
