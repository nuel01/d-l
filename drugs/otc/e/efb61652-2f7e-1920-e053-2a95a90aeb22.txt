2 . 2 Recommended Dose As there are significant differences in the half - life of IgG among patients with primary humoral immunodeficiency , the frequency and amount of immunoglobulin therapy may vary from patient to patient .
The proper amount can be determined by monitoring clinical response .
The recommended dose of BIVIGAM for replacement therapy in primary humoral immunodeficiency ( PI ) is 300 to 800 mg / kg body weight administered every 3 to 4 weeks .
The dosage may be adjusted over time to achieve the desired trough levels and clinical response .
BIVIGAM dose adjustments may be required in patients who fail to maintain trough total IgG concentrations of at least 500 mg / dL with a target of 600 mg / dL .
Starting with the second infusion , the dose will be adjusted proportionally , targeting a trough of ≥ 600 mg / dL , based on the previous trough and the associated dose .
2 . 3 Administration It has been reported that the frequency of adverse drug reactions to IGIV increases with the infusion rate .
Initial infusion rates should be slow .
If there are no adverse drug reactions , the infusion rate for subsequent infusions can be slowly increased to the maximum rate .
For patients experiencing adverse drug reactions , it is advisable to reduce the infusion rate in subsequent infusions .
Table 1 : Recommended Infusion Rates for BIVIGAM Indication Initial Infusion Rate ( for first 10 minutes ) Maintenance Infusion Rate ( if tolerated ) PI 0 . 5 mg / kg / min ( 0 . 005 mL / kg / min ) Increase every 20 minutes ( if tolerated ) by 0 . 8 mg / kg / min up to 6 mg / kg / min .
Monitor patient vital signs throughout the infusion .
Slow or stop the infusion if adverse reactions occur .
If symptoms subside promptly , the infusion may be resumed at a lower rate that is comfortable for the patient .
Ensure that patients with pre - existing renal insufficiency are not volume depleted .
For patients judged to be at risk for renal dysfunction or thrombotic events , administer BIVIGAM at the minimum infusion rate practicable , and consider discontinuation of administration if renal function deteriorates ( see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions [ 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 ] ) .

[ 3 ] 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • BIVIGAM is contraindicated in patients who have had an anaphylactic or severe systemic reaction to the administration of human immune globulin .
• BIVIGAM is contraindicated in IgA deficiency patients with antibodies to IgA and a history of hypersensitivity .
• History of anaphylactic or severe systemic reactions to human immunoglobulin .
[ 4 ] • IgA deficient patients with antibodies to IgA and a history of hypersensitivity .
[ 4 , 5 . 2 ] 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Thrombotic events have occurred in patients receiving IGIV therapy .
Monitor patients with known risk factors for thrombotic events ; consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity for those at risk of hyperviscosity .
[ 5 . 1 , 5 . 4 ] • IgA deficient patients with antibodies against IgA are at greater risk of developing severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions .
Have medications such as epinephrine available immediately to treat any acute severe hypersensitivity reactions .
[ 4 , 5 . 2 ] • Monitor renal function , including blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , serum creatinine , and urine output in patients at risk of developing acute renal failure .
[ 5 . 3 , 5 . 9 ] • Hyperproteinemia , increased serum viscosity , and hyponatremia or pseudohyponatremia can occur in patients receiving IGIV therapy .
[ 5 . 4 ] • Aseptic meningitis syndrome ( AMS ) has been reported with IGIV treatments , especially with high doses or rapid infusion .
[ 5 . 5 ] • Hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to treatment with IGIV products .
Monitor patients for hemolysis and hemolytic anemia .
[ 5 . 6 ] • Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions ( Transfusion - related acute lung injury [ TRALI ] ) .
If transfusion - related acute lung injury is suspected , test the product and patient for antineutrophil antibodies .
[ 5 . 7 ] • Because this product is made from human blood , it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents , e . g . , viruses , and theoretically , the Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease ( CJD ) agent .
[ 5 . 8 ] 5 . 1 Thrombosis Thrombosis may occur following treatment with immune globulin ( IGIV ) products , including BIVIGAM .
4 , 5 , 6 Risk factors may include : advanced age , prolonged immobilization , hypercoagulable conditions , history of venous or arterial thrombosis , use of estrogens , indwelling central vascular catheters , hyperviscosity and cardiovascular risk factors .
Thrombosis may occur in the absence of known risk factors Consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity , including those with cryoglobulins , fasting chylomicronemia / markedly high triacylglycerols ( triglycerides ) , or monoclonal gammopathies .
For patients at risk of thrombosis , administer BIVIGAM at the minimum dose and infusion rate practicable .
Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration .
Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity ( see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration [ 2 . 3 ] , Patient Counseling Information [ 17 . 2 ] ) .
5 . 2 Hypersensitivity Severe hypersensitivity reactions may occur with IGIV products , including BIVIGAM .
In case of hypersensitivity , discontinue BIVIGAM infusion immediately and institute appropriate treatment .
Medications such as epinephrine should be available for immediate treatment of acute hypersensitivity reactions .
BIVIGAM contains trace amounts of IgA ( ≤ 200 micrograms per milliliter ) ( see Description [ 11 ] ) .
Patients with known antibodies to IgA may have a greater risk of developing potentially severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions .
BIVIGAM is contraindicated in IgA deficient patients with antibodies against IgA and a history of hypersensitivity reaction ( see Contraindications [ 4 ] ) .
5 . 3 Acute Renal Dysfunction and Acute Renal Failure Acute renal dysfunction / failure , osmotic nephrosis , and death 1 , 2 may occur upon use of human IGIV products .
Ensure that patients are not volume depleted before administering BIVIGAM .
Periodic monitoring of renal function and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to be at increased risk of developing acute renal failure .
2 Assess renal function , including measurement of blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) and serum creatinine , before the initial infusion of BIVIGAM and at appropriate intervals thereafter .
If renal function deteriorates , consider discontinuing BIVIGAM ( see Patient Counseling Information [ 17 . 1 ] ) .
In patients who are at risk of developing renal dysfunction , because of pre - existing renal insufficiency or predisposition to acute renal failure ( such as diabetes mellitus , hypovolemia , overweight , use of concomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products or age of > 65 years ) , administer BIVIGAM at the minimum infusion rate practicable ( see Dosage and Administration [ 2 . 3 ] ) .
5 . 4 Hyperproteinemia , Increased Serum Viscosity , and Hyponatremia Hyperproteinemia , increased serum viscosity , and hyponatremia may occur in patients receiving IGIV therapy , including BIVIGAM .
It is critical to clinically distinguish true hyponatremia from a pseudohyponatremia that is associated with or causally related to hyperproteinemia with concomitant decreased calculated serum osmolality or elevated osmolar gap , because treatment aimed at decreasing serum free water in patients with pseudohyponatremia may lead to volume depletion , a further increase in serum viscosity , and a possible predisposition to thrombotic events .
3 5 . 5 Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome ( AMS ) AMS may occur infrequently with IGIV treatments including BIVIGAM .
AMS usually begins within several hours to 2 days following IGIV treatment .
Discontinuation of IGIV treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae .
7 , 8 , 9 AMS is characterized by the following signs and symptoms : severe headache , nuchal rigidity , drowsiness , fever , photophobia , painful eye movements , nausea , and vomiting ( see Patient Counseling Information [ 17 . 3 ] ) .
Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) studies frequently reveal pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per cubic millimeter , predominantly from the granulocytic series , and elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg / dL , but negative culture results .
Conduct a thorough neurological examination on patients exhibiting such signs and symptoms , including CSF studies , to rule out other causes of meningitis .
AMS may occur more frequently in association with high doses ( 2 g / kg ) and / or rapid infusion of IGIV .
5 . 6 Hemolysis IGIV products , including BIVIGAM , may contain blood group antibodies that can act as hemolysins and induce in vivo coating of red blood cells ( RBCs ) with immunoglobulin , causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction and , rarely , hemolysis .
10 , 11 , 12 Delayed hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration , 13 and acute hemolysis , consistent with intravascular hemolysis , has been reported .
Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis ( see Patient Counseling Information [ 17 . 4 ] ) .
If these are present after BIVIGAM infusion , perform appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing .
If transfusion is indicated for patients who develop hemolysis with clinically compromising anemia after receiving IGIV , perform adequate cross - matching to avoid exacerbating on - going hemolysis .
5 . 7 Transfusion - Related Acute Lung Injury ( TRALI ) Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema may occur in patients following IGIV treatment 14 including BIVIGAM .
TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress , pulmonary edema , hypoxemia , normal left ventricular function , and fever .
Symptoms typically appear within 1 to 6 hours following treatment .
Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions .
If TRALI is suspected , perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti - neutrophil antibodies in both the product and the patient ’ s serum ( see Patient Counseling Information [ 17 . 5 ] ) .
TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support .
5 . 8 Transmissible Infectious Agents Because BIVIGAM is made from human blood , it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents , e . g . , viruses , and theoretically , the Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease ( CJD ) agent .
No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have been associated with the use of BIVIGAM .
All infections suspected by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported by the physician or other healthcare provider to ADMA Biologics at 1 - 800 - 458 - 4244 .
Before prescribing BIVIGAM , the physician should discuss the risks and benefits of its use with the patient ( see Patient Counseling Information [ 17 . 6 ] ) .
5 . 9 Monitoring Laboratory Tests • Periodic monitoring of renal function and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to be at increased risk of developing acute renal failure .
Assess renal function , including measurement of blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) and serum creatinine , before the initial infusion of BIVIGAM and at appropriate intervals thereafter .
• Because of the potentially increased risk of thrombosis with IGIV treatment , consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity , including those with cryoglobulins , fasting chylomicronemia / markedly high triacylglycerols ( triglycerides ) , or monoclonal gammopathies .
• If signs and / or symptoms of hemolysis are present after an infusion of BIVIGAM , perform appropriate laboratory testing for confirmation .
• If TRALI is suspected , perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti - neutrophil antibodies in both the product and patient ’ s serum .
5 . 10 Interference with Laboratory Tests After infusion of immunoglobulin , the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in the patient ’ s blood may yield positive serological testing results , with the potential for misleading interpretation .
Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyte antigens ( e . g . , A , B , and D ) may cause a positive direct or indirect antiglobulin ( Coombs ’ ) test .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Serious adverse reactions observed in clinical trial subjects receiving BIVIGAM were vomiting and dehydration in one subject .
The most common adverse reactions to BIVIGAM ( reported in ≥ 5 % of clinical study subjects ) were headache , fatigue , infusion site reaction , nausea , sinusitis , blood pressure increased , diarrhea , dizziness , and lethargy .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another product and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
In a multicenter , open - label , non - randomized clinical trial , 63 subjects with PI , on regular IGIV replacement therapy , received doses of BIVIGAM ranging from 254 to 1029 mg / kg ( median dose 462 . 8 mg / kg ) every 3 weeks or 4 weeks for up to 12 months ( mean 317 . 3 days ; range 66 – 386 days ) ( see Clinical Studies [ 14 ] ) .
The use of pre - medication was discouraged ; however , if subjects required pre - medication ( antipyretic , antihistamine , or antiemetic agent ) for recurrent reactions to immune globulins , they were allowed to continue those medications for this trial .
Of the 746 infusions administered , 41 ( 65 % ) subjects received premedication prior to 415 ( 56 % ) infusions .
Fifty - nine subjects ( 94 % ) had an adverse reaction at some time during the study .
The proportion of subjects who had at least one adverse reaction was the same for both the 3 - and 4 - week cycles .
The most common adverse reactions observed in this clinical trial were headache ( 32 subjects , 51 % ) , sinusitis ( 24 subjects , 38 % ) , fatigue ( 18 subjects , 29 % ) , upper respiratory tract infection ( 16 subjects , 25 % ) , diarrhea ( 13 subjects , 21 % ) , cough ( 14 subjects , 22 % ) , bronchitis ( 12 subjects , 19 % ) , pyrexia ( 12 subjects , 19 % ) , and nausea ( 9 subjects , 14 % ) .
Adverse reactions ( ARs ) are those occurring during or within 72 hours after the end of an infusion .
In this study , the upper bound of the 1 - sided 95 % confidence interval for the proportion of BIVIGAM infusions with one or more temporally associated adverse reactions was 31 % .
The total number of adverse reactions was 431 ( a rate of 0 . 58 ARs per infusion ) .
Table 2 : Adverse Reactions ( ARs ) ( within 72 hours after the end of a BIVIGAM infusion ) in ≥ 5 % of Subjects aSymptoms occurring under pre - existing fibromyalgia ARs No .
Subjects Reporting ARs ( % of Subjects ) [ n = 63 ] No .
Infusions With ARs ( % of Infusions ) [ n = 746 ] Headache 27 ( 43 % ) 115 ( 15 . 4 % ) Fatigue 15 ( 24 % ) 59 ( 7 . 9 % ) Infusion Site Reaction 5 ( 8 % ) 5 ( 0 . 7 % ) Nausea 5 ( 8 % ) 8 ( 1 . 1 % ) Sinusitis 5 ( 8 % ) 5 ( 0 . 7 % ) Blood Pressure Increased 4 ( 6 % ) 5 ( 0 . 7 % ) Diarrhea 4 ( 6 % ) 4 ( 0 . 5 % ) Dizziness 4 ( 6 % ) 4 ( 0 . 5 % ) Lethargy 4 ( 6 % ) 4 ( 0 . 5 % ) Back Pain 3 ( 5 % ) 3 ( 0 . 4 % ) Blood Pressure Diastolic Decreased 3 ( 5 % ) 5 ( 0 . 7 % ) Fibromyalgia a 3 ( 5 % ) 17 ( 2 . 3 % ) Migraine 3 ( 5 % ) 8 ( 1 . 1 % ) Myalgia 3 ( 5 % ) 4 ( 0 . 5 % ) Pharyngolaryngeal Pain 3 ( 5 % ) 3 ( 0 . 4 % ) Seven subjects ( 11 . 1 % ) experienced 11 serious ARs .
Two of these were related serious ARs ( vomiting and dehydration ) that occurred in one subject .
One subject withdrew from the study due to ARs related to BIVIGAM ( lethargy , headache , tachycardia and pruritus ) .
All 63 subjects enrolled in this study had a negative direct antiglobulin ( Coombs ’ ) test at baseline .
During the study , no subjects showed clinical evidence of hemolytic anemia .
No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have been associated with the use of BIVIGAM .
During the clinical trial no subjects tested positive for infection due to human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , or hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) .
There was a single positive finding for parvovirus ( B19 virus ) during the study .
This subject came in contact with acute B19 virus from working at a school greeting children where a child was reported to have symptomatic Fifth ' s disease .
There was no cluster ( no other cases in other subjects ) of B19 virus transmission with the IGIV batch concerned .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Because postmarketing reporting of adverse reactions is voluntary and from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency of these reactions or establish a causal relationship to product exposure .
The following adverse reactions have been identified and reported during the post - approval use of IGIV products : • Respiratory : Apnea , Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) , Transfusion Associated Lung Injury ( TRALI ) , cyanosis , hypoxemia , pulmonary edema , dyspnea , bronchospasm .
• Cardiovascular : Cardiac arrest , thromboembolism , vascular collapse , hypotension .
• Neurological : Coma , loss of consciousness , seizures , tremor .
• Integumentary : Stevens - Johnson syndrome , epidermolysis , erythema multiforme , bullous dermatitis .
• Hematologic : Pancytopenia , leukopenia , hemolysis , positive direct antiglobulin ( Coombs ’ ) test .
• General / Body as a Whole : Pyrexia , rigors .
• Musculoskeletal : Back pain .
• Gastrointestinal : Hepatic dysfunction , abdominal pain .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Passive transfer of antibodies may transiently interfere with the immune response to live virus vaccines , such as measles , mumps , rubella , and varicella .
[ 7 ] • Passive transfer of antibodies may confound the results of serological testing .
[ 5 . 10 ] 7 . 1 Live Virus Vaccines Immunoglobulin administration may transiently impair the efficacy of live attenuated virus vaccines such as measles , mumps , rubella , and varicella because the continued presence of high levels of passively acquired antibody may interfere with an active antibody response .
15 , 16 The immunizing physician should be informed of recent therapy with BIVIGAM so that appropriate measures may be taken ( see Patient Counseling Information [ 17 . 7 ] ) .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Use in pregnant women has not been evaluated .
Use BIVIGAM in pregnant women only if clearly needed .
[ 8 . 1 ] • Geriatric Use : In patients over age 65 or in any patient at risk of developing renal insufficiency , do not exceed the recommended dose , and infuse BIVIGAM at the minimum infusion rate practicable .
[ 8 . 5 ] 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with BIVIGAM .
It is not known whether BIVIGAM can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
BIVIGAM should be given to pregnant women only if clearly needed .
17 , 18 8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Use of BIVIGAM in nursing mothers has not been evaluated .
BIVIGAM should be given to nursing mothers only if clearly needed .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use BIVIGAM was evaluated in 9 pediatric patients ( 4 children ages 6 – 11 years and 5 adolescents ages 12 – 16 years ) with PI .
This number of pediatric patients was too small for safety or efficacy .
The safety and effectiveness of BIVIGAM has not been established in pediatric patients with PI who are under the age of 6 ( see Clinical Studies [ 14 ] ) .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use BIVIGAM should be used with caution in patients age 65 and over who are judged to be at increased risk of developing renal insufficiency or thrombotic events ( see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions [ 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 ] ) .
Do not exceed recommended doses and administer BIVIGAM at the minimum infusion rate practicable .
BIVIGAM was evaluated in 9 patients age 65 and older with PI .
This number of geriatric patients is not being sufficient to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients ( see Clinical Studies [ 14 ] ) .
11 DESCRIPTION BIVIGAM is a purified , sterile , ready - to - use preparation of concentrated human immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) antibodies .
The distribution of IgG subclasses is similar to that of normal plasma .
19 , 20 The active ingredient is human immunoglobulin purified from source human plasma and processed using a modified classical Cohn Method 6 / Oncley Method 9 fractionation procedure .
BIVIGAM contains 100 ± 10 mg / mL protein , of which not less than 96 % is human immunoglobulin obtained from source human plasma .
It is formulated in water for injection containing 0 . 100 - 0 . 140 M sodium chloride , 0 . 20 - 0 . 29 M glycine , 0 . 15 – 0 . 25 % polysorbate 80 , and pH 4 . 0 – 4 . 6 .
BIVIGAM contains ≤ 200 µg / mL of IgA .
Each plasma donation used for the manufacture of BIVIGAM is collected from FDA licensed facilities and undergoes rigorous testing .
Plasma donations must test negative for hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) strains 1 and 2 ( anti - HIV - 1 / 2 ) , and antibodies to the hepatitis C virus ( anti - HCV ) as determined by enzyme immuno assay ( EIA ) .
In addition , each plasma unit must test negative and / or non - reactive for HIV RNA , HCV RNA , HBV DNA , Hepatitis A Virus ( HAV ) RNA , and Parvovirus B19 ( B19 virus ) DNA as determined by Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing ( NAT ) of plasma minipools .
NAT for B19 virus DNA is also performed on a sample of the manufacturing pool and the limit for B19 virus DNA in a manufacturing pool is set not to exceed 10 4 IU / mL .
The manufacturing process of BIVIGAM employs three steps to remove / inactivate adventitious viruses to minimize the risk of virus transmission .
The steps are " Precipitation and removal of fraction III " during cold ethanol fractionation , classical " Solvent / detergent treatment " and " 35 nm virus filtration " .
In compliance with current guidelines , the steps have been separately validated in a series of in vitro experiments for their capacity to inactivate or remove both enveloped and non - enveloped viruses .
Precipitation and removal of fraction III removes both enveloped and non - enveloped viruses , solvent / detergent treatment represents a virus inactivation step for enveloped viruses , and 35 nm virus filtration removes both enveloped and non - enveloped viruses by size exclusion .
In addition to the steps above , low pH during several steps of the production process contributes to virus inactivation .
The results of virus validation studies for BIVIGAM are shown in Table 3 , expressed as log 10 reduction factors .

The broad spectrum of neutralizing IgG antibodies against bacterial and viral pathogens and their toxins helps to avoid recurrent serious opportunistic infections .
IgG antibodies are opsonins that increase phagocytosis and elimination of pathogens from the circulation .
The mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated in PI .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In the clinical study assessing the efficacy and safety of BIVIGAM in 63 subjects with PI ( see Clinical Studies [ 14 . 1 ] ) , serum concentrations of total IgG and IgG subclasses were measured in 21 subjects ( ages 18 to 75 ) following the 4 th infusion for the 5 subjects on the 3 - week dosing interval and following the 5 th infusion for the 16 subjects on the 4 - week dosing interval .
The dose of BIVIGAM used in these subjects ranged from 300 mg / kg to 800 mg / kg .
After the infusion , blood samples were taken until Day 21 and Day 28 for the 3 - week and 4 - week dosing intervals , respectively .
Table 4 summarizes the Total IgG Pharmacokinetic Parameters of BIVIGAM , based on serum concentrations of total IgG .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No animal studies were conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic effects of BIVIGAM or its effects on fertility .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology No animal studies were conducted to evaluate possible toxicity of BIVIGAM in animals .
BIVIGAM contains Polysorbate 80 at a concentration of up to 2 . 5 mg / mL .
Intravenous administrations of Polysorbate 80 in multiple species have been linked with a decrease in blood pressure .
In rats , single doses of Polysorbate 80 that were up to 25 times higher than the amount from 800 mg / kg BIVIGAM resulted in an increase of liver enzymes and total bilirubin .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 .
1 Treatment of Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency A prospective , open - label , single - arm , multicenter trial assessed the efficacy , safety , and pharmacokinetics of BIVIGAM in adult and pediatric subjects with PI .
Study subjects were receiving regular IGIV replacement therapy , with a stable dose between 300 and 800 mg / kg for at least 3 months prior to participation .
Subjects received a BIVIGAM infusion administered every 3 or 4 weeks ( both the dose and schedule depending on their prior therapy ) for approximately 1 year .
A total of 63 subjects were enrolled in the trial , 31 men and 32 women with a mean age of 41 years .
Forty - four subjects were adults ( 70 % ) between 18 and 64 years of age .
There were 9 pediatric subjects ( see Pediatric Use [ 8 . 4 ] ) , and 9 elderly subjects ( 14 % , ≥ 65 years of age ) .
The oldest subject was 75 years of age .
There were 17 subjects with a 3 - week cycle and 46 subjects with a 4 - week cycle .
There were 51 subjects ( 81 % ) with common variable immunodeficiency as their primary diagnosis , followed by X - linked agammaglobulinemia and ‘ Other ’ ( 9 . 5 % each ) .
The intent to treat ( ITT ) population included 58 subjects and was used for efficacy analysis .
The primary endpoint of the study was to assess the efficacy of BIVIGAM in preventing serious bacterial infections ( SBIs ) defined as rate of < 1 . 0 cases of bacterial pneumonia , bacteremia / septicemia , osteomyelitis / septic arthritis , visceral abscess , and bacterial meningitis per person - year .
Secondary efficacy parameters included time to first SBI and time to first infection of any kind / seriousness , days on antibiotics ( excluding prophylaxis ) , days off school / work due to infections , all confirmed infections of any kind or seriousness , and hospitalizations due to infection .
During the 12 - month study period , two serious acute bacterial infections occurred in two subjects with an onset date between the first infusion of BIVIGAM and the first follow - up visit , inclusive .
Thus , the mean event rate of serious , acute , bacterial infections per year was 0 . 037 ( with an upper 1 - sided 99 % confidence interval of 0 . 101 , which met the study ’ s primary efficacy endpoint ) .
The two SBIs were cases of bacterial pneumonia .
Thirty - three percent of subjects had days off work or school due to an infection .
Of the 197 infections reported , 2 resulted in hospitalization .
Results for the pediatric subjects were similar to those for the adult subjects .
( see Table 5 ) .
Table 5 : Summary of Efficacy Results in Subjects with PI SBI = serious bacterial infections .
