1 . 1 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus BYETTA is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
1 . 2 Important Limitations of Use BYETTA is not a substitute for insulin .
BYETTA should not be used for the treatment of type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis , as it would not be effective in these settings .
The concurrent use of BYETTA with prandial insulin has not been studied and cannot be recommended .
Based on postmarketing data BYETTA has been associated with acute pancreatitis , including fatal and non - fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis .
BYETTA has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis .
It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for pancreatitis while using BYETTA .
Other antidiabetic therapies should be considered in patients with a history of pancreatitis .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Inject subcutaneously within 60 minutes prior to morning and evening meals ( or before the two main meals of the day , approximately 6 hours or more apart ) ( 2 . 1 ) .
• Initiate at 5 mcg per dose twice daily ; increase to 10 mcg twice daily after 1 month based on clinical response ( 2 . 1 ) .
2 . 1 Recommended Dosing BYETTA should be initiated at 5 mcg administered twice daily at any time within the 60 - minute period before the morning and evening meals ( or before the two main meals of the day , approximately 6 hours or more apart ) .
BYETTA should not be administered after a meal .
Based on clinical response , the dose of BYETTA can be increased to 10 mcg twice daily after 1 month of therapy .
Initiation with 5 mcg reduces the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal side effects .
Each dose should be administered as a subcutaneous ( SC ) injection in the thigh , abdomen , or upper arm .
Do not mix BYETTA with insulin .
Do not transfer BYETTA from the pen to a syringe or a vial .
No data are available on the safety or efficacy of intravenous or intramuscular injection of BYETTA .
Use BYETTA only if it is clear , colorless and contains no particles .

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Pancreatitis : Postmarketing reports with exenatide , including fatal and non - fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis .
Discontinue BYETTA promptly .
BYETTA should not be restarted .
Consider other antidiabetic therapies in patients with a history of pancreatitis ( 5 . 1 ) .
• Hypoglycemia : Increased risk when BYETTA is used in combination with medications known to cause hypoglycemia ( e . g . insulin or insulin secretagogue ) .
Consider reducing the dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue ( 5 . 2 ) .
• Renal Impairment : Postmarketing reports with exenatide , sometimes requiring hemodialysis and kidney transplantation .
BYETTA should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment or end - stage renal disease and should be used with caution in patients with renal transplantation .
Caution should be applied when initiating BYETTA or escalating the dose of BYETTA in patients with moderate renal failure ( 5 . 3 , 8 . 6 , 12 . 3 ) • Severe Gastrointestinal Disease : Use of BYETTA is not recommended in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease ( e . g . , gastroparesis ) ( 5 . 4 ) .
• Hypersensitivity : Postmarketing reports with exenatide of hypersensitivity reactions ( e . g . anaphylaxis and angioedema ) .
The patient should discontinue BYETTA and other suspect medications and promptly seek medical advice ( 5 . 6 ) .
• Macrovascular outcomes : There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with BYETTA or any other antidiabetic drug ( 5 . 7 ) .
5 . 1 Acute Pancreatitis Based on postmarketing data BYETTA has been associated with acute pancreatitis , including fatal and non - fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis .
After initiation of BYETTA , and after dose increases , observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis ( including persistent severe abdominal pain , sometimes radiating to the back , which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting ) .
If pancreatitis is suspected , BYETTA should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated .
If pancreatitis is confirmed , BYETTA should not be restarted .
Consider antidiabetic therapies other than BYETTA in patients with a history of pancreatitis .
5 . 2 Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when BYETTA is used in combination with a sulfonylurea .
Therefore , patients receiving BYETTA and a sulfonylurea may require a lower dose of the sulfonylurea to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia .
When BYETTA is used in combination with insulin , the dose of insulin should be evaluated .
In patients at increased risk of hypoglycemia consider reducing the dose of insulin [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The concurrent use of BYETTA with prandial insulin has not been studied and cannot be recommended .
It is also possible that the use of BYETTA with other glucose - independent insulin secretagogues ( e . g . meglitinides ) could increase the risk of hypoglycemia .
For additional information on glucose dependent effects see Mechanism of Action ( 12 . 1 ) .
5 . 3 Renal Impairment BYETTA should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min ) or end - stage renal disease and should be used with caution in patients with renal transplantation [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
In patients with end - stage renal disease receiving dialysis , single doses of BYETTA 5 mcg were not well - tolerated due to gastrointestinal side effects .
Because BYETTA may induce nausea and vomiting with transient hypovolemia , treatment may worsen renal function .
Caution should be applied when initiating or escalating doses of BYETTA from 5 mcg to 10 mcg in patients with moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL / min ) .
There have been postmarketing reports of altered renal function , including increased serum creatinine , renal impairment , worsened chronic renal failure and acute renal failure , sometimes requiring hemodialysis or kidney transplantation .
Some of these events occurred in patients receiving one or more pharmacologic agents known to affect renal function or hydration status , such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , or diuretics .
Some events occurred in patients who had been experiencing nausea , vomiting , or diarrhea , with or without dehydration .
Reversibility of altered renal function has been observed in many cases with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents , including BYETTA .
Exenatide has not been found to be directly nephrotoxic in preclinical or clinical studies .
5 . 4 Gastrointestinal Disease BYETTA has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease , including gastroparesis .
Because BYETTA is commonly associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions , including nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea , the use of BYETTA is not recommended in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease .
5 . 5 Immunogenicity Patients may develop antibodies to exenatide following treatment with BYETTA .
Antibody levels were measured in 90 % of subjects in the 30 - week , 24 - week and 16 - week studies of BYETTA .
In 3 % , 4 % and 1 % of these patients , respectively , antibody formation was associated with an attenuated glycemic response .
If there is worsening glycemic control or failure to achieve targeted glycemic control , alternative antidiabetic therapy should be considered [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 6 Hypersensitivity There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions ( e . g . anaphylaxis and angioedema ) in patients treated with BYETTA .
If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs , the patient should discontinue BYETTA and other suspect medications and promptly seek medical advice [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 7 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with BYETTA or any other antidiabetic drug .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS • Most common ( ≥ 5 % ) and occurring more frequently than placebo in clinical trials : nausea , hypoglycemia , vomiting , diarrhea , feeling jittery , dizziness , headache , dyspepsia , constipation , asthenia .
Nausea usually decreases over time ( 5 . 2 , 6 ) .
• Postmarketing reports with exenatide of increased international normalized ratio ( INR ) with concomitant use of warfarin , sometimes with bleeding ( 6 . 2 , 7 . 2 ) .

Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose value consistent with hypoglycemia or prompt recovery after treatment for hypoglycemia .
[ 2 ] When BYETTA was initiated in combination with insulin glargine , the dose of insulin glargine was decreased by 20 % in patients with an HbA1c ≤ 8 . 0 % to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia .
See Table 9 for insulin dose titration algorithm .
Immunogenicity Antibodies were assessed in 90 % of subjects in the 30 - week , 24 - week and 16 - week studies of BYETTA .
In the 30 - week controlled trials of BYETTA add - on to metformin and / or sulfonylurea , antibodies were assessed at 2 - to 6 - week intervals .
The mean antibody titer peaked at week 6 and was reduced by 55 % by week 30 .
Three hundred and sixty patients ( 38 % ) had low titer antibodies ( < 625 ) to exenatide at 30 weeks .
The level of glycemic control ( HbA1c ) in these patients was generally comparable to that observed in the 534 patients ( 56 % ) without antibody titers .
An additional 59 patients ( 6 % ) had higher titer antibodies ( ≥ 625 ) at 30 weeks .
Of these patients , 32 ( 3 % overall ) had an attenuated glycemic response to BYETTA ; the remaining 27 ( 3 % overall ) had a glycemic response comparable to that of patients without antibodies [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
In the 16 - week trial of BYETTA add - on to thiazolidinediones , with or without metformin , 36 patients ( 31 % ) had low titer antibodies to exenatide at 16 weeks .
The level of glycemic control in these patients was generally comparable to that observed in the 69 patients ( 60 % ) without antibody titer .
An additional 10 patients ( 9 % ) had higher titer antibodies at 16 weeks .
Of these patients , 4 ( 4 % overall ) had an attenuated glycemic response to BYETTA ; the remaining 6 ( 5 % overall ) had a glycemic response comparable to that of patients without antibodies [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
In the 24 - week trial of BYETTA used as monotherapy , 40 patients ( 28 % ) had low titer antibodies to exenatide at 24 weeks .
The level of glycemic control in these patients was generally comparable to that observed in the 101 patients ( 70 % ) without antibody titers .
An additional 3 patients ( 2 % ) had higher titer antibodies at 24 weeks .
Of these patients , 1 ( 1 % overall ) had an attenuated glycemic response to BYETTA ; the remaining 2 ( 1 % overall ) had a glycemic response comparable to that of patients without antibodies [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Antibodies to exenatide were not assessed in the 30 - week trial of BYETTA used in combination with insulin glargine .
Two hundred and ten patients with antibodies to exenatide in the BYETTA clinical trials were tested for the presence of cross - reactive antibodies to GLP - 1 and / or glucagon .
No treatment - emergent cross reactive antibodies were observed across the range of titers .

No placebo - treated patients withdrew due to nausea or vomiting .
6 . 2 Post - Marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post - approval use of BYETTA .
Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Allergy / Hypersensitivity : injection - site reactions , generalized pruritus and / or urticaria , macular or papular rash , angioedema , anaphylactic reaction [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
Drug Interactions : International normalized ratio ( INR ) increased with concomitant warfarin use sometimes associated with bleeding [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Gastrointestinal : nausea , vomiting , and / or diarrhea resulting in dehydration ; abdominal distension , abdominal pain , eructation , constipation , flatulence , acute pancreatitis , hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis sometimes resulting in death [ see Limitations of Use ( 1 . 2 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Neurologic : dysgeusia ; somnolence Renal and Urinary Disorders : altered renal function , including increased serum creatinine , renal impairment , worsened chronic renal failure or acute renal failure ( sometimes requiring hemodialysis ) , kidney transplant and kidney transplant dysfunction [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : alopecia 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • May impact absorption of orally administered medications ( 7 . 1 , 12 . 3 ) • Warfarin : Postmarketing reports of increased INR sometimes associated with bleeding .
Monitor INR frequently until stable upon initiation or alteration of BYETTA therapy ( 6 . 2 , 7 . 2 ) .
7 . 1 Orally Administered Drugs The effect of BYETTA to slow gastric emptying can reduce the extent and rate of absorption of orally administered drugs .
BYETTA should be used with caution in patients receiving oral medications that have narrow therapeutic index or require rapid gastrointestinal absorption [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
For oral medications that are dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy , such as contraceptives and antibiotics , patients should be advised to take those drugs at least 1 hour before BYETTA injection .
If such drugs are to be administered with food , patients should be advised to take them with a meal or snack when BYETTA is not administered [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Warfarin There are postmarketing reports of increased INR sometimes associated with bleeding , with concomitant use of warfarin and BYETTA [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
In a drug interaction study , BYETTA did not have a significant effect on INR [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In patients taking warfarin , prothrombin time should be monitored more frequently after initiation or alteration of BYETTA therapy .
Once a stable prothrombin time has been documented , prothrombin times can be monitored at the intervals usually recommended for patients on warfarin .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Based on animal data , BYETTA may cause fetal harm .
BYETTA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
To report drug exposure during pregnancy call 1 - 800 - 633 - 9081 ( 8 . 1 ) .
• Nursing Mothers : Caution should be exercised when BYETTA is administered to a nursing woman ( 8 . 3 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of BYETTA use in pregnant women .
In animal studies , exenatide caused cleft palate , irregular skeletal ossification and an increased number of neonatal deaths .
BYETTA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Female mice given SC doses of 6 , 68 , or 760 mcg / kg / day beginning 2 weeks prior to and throughout mating until gestation day 7 had no adverse fetal effects .
At the maximal dose , 760 mcg / kg / day , systemic exposures were up to 390 times the human exposure resulting from the maximum recommended dose of 20 mcg / day , based on AUC [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 3 ) ] .
In developmental toxicity studies , pregnant animals received exenatide subcutaneously during organogenesis .
Specifically , fetuses from pregnant rabbits given SC doses of 0 . 2 , 2 , 22 , 156 , or 260 mcg / kg / day from gestation day 6 through 18 experienced irregular skeletal ossifications from exposures 12 times the human exposure resulting from the maximum recommended dose of 20 mcg / day , based on AUC .
Moreover , fetuses from pregnant mice given SC doses of 6 , 68 , 460 , or 760 mcg / kg / day from gestation day 6 through 15 demonstrated reduced fetal and neonatal growth , cleft palate and skeletal effects at systemic exposure 3 times the human exposure resulting from the maximum recommended dose of 20 mcg / day , based on AUC [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 3 ) ] .
Lactating mice given SC doses of 6 , 68 , or 760 mcg / kg / day from gestation day 6 through lactation day 20 ( weaning ) , experienced an increased number of neonatal deaths .
Deaths were observed on postpartum days 2 - 4 in dams given 6 mcg / kg / day , a systemic exposure 3 times the human exposure resulting from the maximum recommended dose of 20 mcg / day , based on AUC [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 3 ) ] .
Pregnancy Registry Amylin Pharmaceuticals , Inc . maintains a Pregnancy Registry to monitor pregnancy outcomes of women exposed to exenatide during pregnancy .
Physicians are encouraged to register patients by calling 1 - 800 - 633 - 9081 .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether exenatide is excreted in human milk .
However , exenatide is present at low concentrations ( less than or equal to 2 . 5 % of the concentration in maternal plasma following subcutaneous dosing ) in the milk of lactating mice .
Many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for clinically significant adverse reactions in nursing infants from exenatide , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug , taking into account these potential risks against the glycemic benefits to the lactating woman .
Caution should be exercised when BYETTA is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of BYETTA have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients ranging from 22 to 73 years of age suggests that age does not influence the pharmacokinetic properties of exenatide [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
BYETTA was studied in 282 patients 65 years of age or older and in 16 patients 75 years of age or older .
No differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection in the elderly based on renal function .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment BYETTA is not recommended for use in patients with end - stage renal disease or severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min ) and should be used with caution in patients with renal transplantation .
No dosage adjustment of BYETTA is required in patients with mild renal impairment ( creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL / min ) .
Caution should be applied when initiating or escalating doses of BYETTA from 5 mcg to 10 mcg in patients with moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL / min ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic study has been performed in patients with a diagnosis of acute or chronic hepatic impairment .
Because exenatide is cleared primarily by the kidney , hepatic dysfunction is not expected to affect blood concentrations of exenatide [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE In a clinical study of BYETTA , three patients with type 2 diabetes each experienced a single overdose of 100 mcg SC ( 10 times the maximum recommended dose ) .
Effects of the overdoses included severe nausea , severe vomiting , and rapidly declining blood glucose concentrations .
One of the three patients experienced severe hypoglycemia requiring parenteral glucose administration .
The three patients recovered without complication .
In the event of overdose , appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient ' s clinical signs and symptoms .
11 DESCRIPTION BYETTA ( exenatide ) is a synthetic peptide that was originally identified in the lizard Heloderma suspectum .
Exenatide differs in chemical structure and pharmacological action from insulin , sulfonylureas ( including D - phenylalanine derivatives and meglitinides ) , biguanides , thiazolidinediones , alpha - glucosidase inhibitors , amylinomimetics and dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 inhibitors .
Exenatide is a 39 - amino acid peptide amide .
Exenatide has the empirical formula C184H282N50O60S and molecular weight of 4186 . 6 Daltons .
The amino acid sequence for exenatide is shown below .
H - His - Gly - Glu - Gly - Thr - Phe - Thr - Ser - Asp - Leu - Ser - Lys - Gln - Met - Glu - Glu - Glu - Ala - Val - Arg - Leu - Phe - Ile - Glu - Trp - Leu - Lys - Asn - Gly - Gly - Pro - Ser - Ser - Gly - Ala - Pro - Pro - Pro - Ser - NH2 BYETTA is supplied for SC injection as a sterile , preserved isotonic solution in a glass cartridge that has been assembled in a pen - injector ( pen ) .
Each milliliter ( mL ) contains 250 micrograms ( mcg ) synthetic exenatide , 2 . 2 mg metacresol as an antimicrobial preservative , mannitol as a tonicity - adjusting agent , and glacial acetic acid and sodium acetate trihydrate in water for injection as a buffering solution at pH 4 . 5 .
Two prefilled pens are available to deliver unit doses of 5 mcg or 10 mcg .
Each prefilled pen will deliver 60 doses to provide for 30 days of twice daily administration ( BID ) .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Incretins , such as glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( GLP - 1 ) , enhance glucose - dependent insulin secretion and exhibit other antihyperglycemic actions following their release into the circulation from the gut .
BYETTA is a GLP - 1 receptor agonist that enhances glucose - dependent insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta - cell , suppresses inappropriately elevated glucagon secretion , and slows gastric emptying .
The amino acid sequence of exenatide partially overlaps that of human GLP - 1 .
Exenatide has been shown to bind and activate the human GLP - 1 receptor in vitro .
This leads to an increase in both glucose - dependent synthesis of insulin , and in vivo secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells , by mechanisms involving cyclic AMP and / or other intracellular signaling pathways .
BYETTA improves glycemic control by reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes through the actions described below .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Glucose - dependent insulin secretion : BYETTA has acute effects on pancreatic beta - cell responsiveness to glucose leading to insulin release predominantly in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations .
This insulin secretion subsides as blood glucose concentrations decrease and approach euglycemia .
However , BYETTA does not impair the normal glucagon response to hypoglycemia .
First - phase insulin response : In healthy individuals , robust insulin secretion occurs during the first 10 minutes following intravenous ( IV ) glucose administration .
This secretion , known as the " first - phase insulin response , " is characteristically absent in patients with type 2 diabetes .
The loss of the first - phase insulin response is an early beta - cell defect in type 2 diabetes .
Administration of BYETTA at therapeutic plasma concentrations restored first - phase insulin response to an IV bolus of glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes ( Figure 1 ) .
Both first - phase insulin secretion and second - phase insulin secretion were significantly increased in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with BYETTA compared with saline ( p < 0 . 001 for both ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 1 : Mean ( + SEM ) Insulin Secretion Rate During Infusion of BYETTA or Saline in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes and During Infusion of Saline in Healthy Subjects Glucagon secretion : In patients with type 2 diabetes , BYETTA moderates glucagon secretion and lowers serum glucagon concentrations during periods of hyperglycemia .
Lower glucagon concentrations lead to decreased hepatic glucose output and decreased insulin demand .
Gastric emptying : BYETTA slows gastric emptying , thereby reducing the rate at which meal - derived glucose appears in the circulation .
Food intake : In both animals and humans , administration of exenatide has been shown to reduce food intake .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Postprandial Glucose In patients with type 2 diabetes , BYETTA reduces postprandial plasma glucose concentrations ( Figure 2 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 2 : Mean ( + SEM ) Postprandial Plasma Glucose Concentrations on Day 1 of BYETTAa Treatment in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Treated With Metformin , a Sulfonylurea , or Both ( N = 54 ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] Fasting Glucose In a single - dose crossover study in patients with type 2 diabetes and fasting hyperglycemia , immediate insulin release followed injection of BYETTA .
Plasma glucose concentrations were significantly reduced with BYETTA compared with placebo ( Figure 3 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 3 : Mean ( + SEM ) Serum Insulin and Plasma Glucose Concentrations Following a One - Time Injection of BYETTAa or Placebo in Fasting Patients With Type 2 Diabetes ( N = 12 ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of exenatide 10 µg subcutaneously on QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized , placebo - , and active - controlled ( moxifloxacin 400 mg ) crossover thorough QTc study in 62 healthy subjects .
In this study with demonstrated ability to detect small effects , the upper bound of the 90 % confidence interval for the largest placebo - adjusted , baseline - corrected QTc was below 10 ms . Thus , BYETTA ( 10 mcg single dose ) was not associated with clinically meaningful prolongation of the QTc interval .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following SC administration to patients with type 2 diabetes , exenatide reaches median peak plasma concentrations in 2 . 1 h .
The mean peak exenatide concentration ( Cmax ) was 211 pg / mL and overall mean area under the time - concentration curve ( AUC0 - inf ) was 1036 pg ∙ h / mL following SC administration of a 10 - mcg dose of BYETTA .
Exenatide exposure ( AUC ) increased proportionally over the therapeutic dose range of 5 mcg to 10 mcg .
The Cmax values increased less than proportionally over the same range .
Similar exposure is achieved with SC administration of BYETTA in the abdomen , thigh , or upper arm .
Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution of exenatide following SC administration of a single dose of BYETTA is 28 . 3 L . Metabolism and Elimination Nonclinical studies have shown that exenatide is predominantly eliminated by glomerular filtration with subsequent proteolytic degradation .
The mean apparent clearance of exenatide in humans is 9 . 1 L / h and the mean terminal half - life is 2 . 4 h .
These pharmacokinetic characteristics of exenatide are independent of the dose .
In most individuals , exenatide concentrations are measurable for approximately 10 h post - dose .
Drug Interactions Acetaminophen When 1000 mg acetaminophen elixir was given with 10 mcg BYETTA ( 0 h ) and 1 hour , 2 hours , and 4 hours after BYETTA injection , acetaminophen AUCs were decreased by 21 % , 23 % , 24 % , and 14 % , respectively ; Cmax was decreased by 37 % , 56 % , 54 % , and 41 % , respectively ; Tmax was increased from 0 . 6 hour in the control period to 0 . 9 hour , 4 . 2 hours , 3 . 3 hours , and 1 . 6 hours , respectively .
Acetaminophen AUC , Cmax and Tmax were not significantly changed when acetaminophen was given 1 hour before BYETTA injection .
Digoxin Administration of repeated doses of BYETTA ( 10 mcg BID ) 30 minutes before oral digoxin ( 0 . 25 mg QD ) decreased the Cmax of digoxin by 17 % and delayed the Tmax of digoxin by approximately 2 . 5 hours ; however , the overall steady - state pharmacokinetic exposure ( e . g . , AUC ) of digoxin was not changed .
Lovastatin Administration of BYETTA ( 10 mcg BID ) 30 minutes before a single oral dose of lovastatin ( 40 mg ) decreased the AUC and Cmax of lovastatin by approximately 40 % and 28 % , respectively , and delayed the Tmax by about 4 hours compared with lovastatin administered alone .
In the 30 - week controlled clinical trials of BYETTA , the use of BYETTA in patients already receiving HMG CoA reductase inhibitors was not associated with consistent changes in lipid profiles compared to baseline .
Lisinopril In patients with mild to moderate hypertension stabilized on lisinopril ( 5 to 20 mg / day ) , BYETTA ( 10 mcg BID ) did not alter steady - state Cmax or AUC of lisinopril .
Lisinopril steady - state Tmax was delayed by 2 hours .
There were no changes in 24 - h mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure .
Oral Contraceptives The effect of BYETTA ( 10 mcg BID ) on single and on multiple doses of a combination oral contraceptive ( 30 mcg ethinyl estradiol plus 150 mcg levonorgestrel ) was studied in healthy female subjects .
Repeated daily doses of the oral contraceptive ( OC ) given 30 minutes after BYETTA administration decreased the Cmax of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel by 45 % and 27 % , respectively and delayed the Tmax of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel by 3 . 0 hours and 3 . 5 hours , respectively , as compared to the oral contraceptive administered alone .
Administration of repeated daily doses of the OC one hour prior to BYETTA administration decreased the mean Cmax of ethinyl estradiol by 15 % but the mean Cmax of levonorgestrel was not significantly changed as compared to when the OC was given alone .
BYETTA did not alter the mean trough concentrations of levonorgestrel after repeated daily dosing of the oral contraceptive for both regimens .
However , the mean trough concentration of ethinyl estradiol was increased by 20 % when the OC was administered 30 minutes after BYETTA administration injection as compared to when the OC was given alone .
The effect of BYETTA on OC pharmacokinetics is confounded by the possible food effect on OC in this study .
Therefore , OC products should be administered at least one hour prior to BYETTA injection .
Warfarin Administration of warfarin ( 25 mg ) 35 minutes after repeated doses of BYETTA ( 5 mcg BID on days 1 - 2 and 10 mcg BID on days 3 - 9 ) in healthy volunteers delayed warfarin Tmax by approximately 2 hours .
No clinically relevant effects on Cmax or AUC of S - and R - enantiomers of warfarin were observed .
BYETTA did not significantly alter the pharmacodynamic properties ( e . g . , international normalized ratio ) of warfarin [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Specific Populations Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetics of exenatide was studied in subjects with normal , mild , or moderate renal impairment and subjects with end stage renal disease .
In subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance 30 to 80 mL / min ) , exenatide exposure was similar to that of subjects with normal renal function .
However , in subjects with end - stage renal disease receiving dialysis , mean exenatide exposure increased by 3 . 37 - fold compared to that of subjects with normal renal function .
[ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic study has been performed in patients with a diagnosis of acute or chronic hepatic impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Age Population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients ranging from 22 to 73 years of age suggests that age does not influence the pharmacokinetic properties of exenatide [ see Use in Specific Population ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Gender Population pharmacokinetic analysis of male and female patients suggests that gender does not influence the distribution and elimination of exenatide .
Race Population pharmacokinetic analysis of samples from Caucasian , Hispanic , Asian , and Black patients suggests that race has no significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of exenatide .
Body Mass Index Population pharmacokinetic analysis of patients with body mass indices ( BMI ) ≥ 30 kg / m2 and < 30 kg / m2 suggests that BMI has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of exenatide .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility A 104 - week carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats at doses of 18 , 70 , or 250 mcg / kg / day administered by bolus SC injection .
Benign thyroid C - cell adenomas were observed in female rats at all exenatide doses .
The incidences in female rats were 8 % and 5 % in the two control groups and 14 % , 11 % , and 23 % in the low - , medium - , and high - dose groups with systemic exposures of 5 , 22 , and 130 times , respectively , the human exposure resulting from the maximum recommended dose of 20 mcg / day , based on plasma area under the curve ( AUC ) .
In a 104 - week carcinogenicity study in mice at doses of 18 , 70 , or 250 mcg / kg / day administered by bolus SC injection , no evidence of tumors was observed at doses up to 250 mcg / kg / day , a systemic exposure up to 95 times the human exposure resulting from the maximum recommended dose of 20 mcg / day , based on AUC .
Exenatide was not mutagenic or clastogenic , with or without metabolic activation , in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay or chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells .
Exenatide was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
In mouse fertility studies with SC doses of 6 , 68 or 760 mcg / kg / day , males were treated for 4 weeks prior to and throughout mating , and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating and throughout mating until gestation day 7 .
No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 760 mcg / kg / day , a systemic exposure 390 times the human exposure resulting from the maximum recommended dose of 20 mcg / day , based on AUC .
13 . 3 Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology In female mice given SC doses of 6 , 68 , or 760 mcg / kg / day beginning 2 weeks prior to and throughout mating until gestation day 7 , there were no adverse fetal effects at doses up to 760 mcg / kg / day , systemic exposures up to 390 times the human exposure resulting from the maximum recommended dose of 20 mcg / day , based on AUC .
In pregnant mice given SC doses of 6 , 68 , 460 , or 760 mcg / kg / day from gestation day 6 through 15 ( organogenesis ) , cleft palate ( some with holes ) and irregular fetal skeletal ossification of rib and skull bones were observed at 6 mcg / kg / day , a systemic exposure 3 times the human exposure resulting from the maximum recommended dose of 20 mcg / day , based on AUC .
In pregnant rabbits given SC doses of 0 . 2 , 2 , 22 , 156 , or 260 mcg / kg / day from gestation day 6 through 18 ( organogenesis ) , irregular fetal skeletal ossifications were observed at 2 mcg / kg / day , a systemic exposure 12 times the human exposure resulting from the maximum recommended dose of 20 mcg / day , based on AUC .
In pregnant mice given SC doses of 6 , 68 , or 760 mcg / kg / day from gestation day 6 through lactation day 20 ( weaning ) , an increased number of neonatal deaths was observed on postpartum days 2 - 4 in dams given 6 mcg / kg / day , a systemic exposure 3 times the human exposure resulting from the maximum recommended dose of 20 mcg / day , based on AUC .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES BYETTA has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin , a sulfonylurea , a thiazolidinedione , a combination of metformin and a sulfonylurea , a combination of metformin and a thiazolidinedione , or in combination with insulin glargine with or without metformin and / or thiazolidinedione .
14 . 1 Monotherapy In a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial of 24 weeks duration , BYETTA 5 mcg BID ( n = 77 ) , BYETTA 10 mcg BID ( n = 78 ) , or placebo BID ( n = 77 ) was used as monotherapy in patients with entry HbA1c ranging from 6 . 5 - 10 % .
All patients assigned to BYETTA initially received 5 mcg BID for 4 weeks .
After 4 weeks , those patients either continued to receive BYETTA 5 mcg BID or had their dose increased to 10 mcg BID .
Patients assigned to placebo received placebo BID throughout the trial .
BYETTA or placebo was injected subcutaneously before the morning and evening meals .
The majority of patients ( 68 % ) were Caucasian , 26 % were West Asian , 3 % were Hispanic , 3 % were Black , and 0 . 4 % were East Asian .
The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 ( or the last value at time of early discontinuation ) .
Compared to placebo , BYETTA 5 mcg BID and 10 mcg BID resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1c from baseline at Week 24 ( Table 6 ) .

On average , there were no adverse effects of exenatide on blood pressure or lipids .
14 . 2 Combination Therapy With Oral Antihyperglycemic Medicines Three 30 - week , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BYETTA in patients with type 2 diabetes whose glycemic control was inadequate with metformin alone , a sulfonylurea alone , or metformin in combination with a sulfonylurea .
In addition , a 16 - week , placebo - controlled trial was conducted where BYETTA was added to existing thiazolidinedione ( pioglitazone or rosiglitazone ) treatment , with or without metformin , in patients with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control .
In the 30 - week trials , after a 4 - week placebo lead - in period , patients were randomly assigned to receive BYETTA 5 mcg BID , BYETTA 10 mcg BID , or placebo BID before the morning and evening meals , in addition to their existing oral antidiabetic agent .
All patients assigned to BYETTA initially received 5 mcg BID for 4 weeks .
After 4 weeks , those patients either continued to receive BYETTA 5 mcg BID or had their dose increased to 10 mcg BID .
Patients assigned to placebo received placebo BID throughout the study .
A total of 1446 patients were randomized in the three 30 - week trials : 991 ( 69 % ) were Caucasian , 224 ( 16 % ) were Hispanic , and 174 ( 12 % ) were Black .
Mean HbA1c values at baseline for the trials ranged from 8 . 2 % to 8 . 7 % .
In the placebo - controlled trial of 16 weeks duration , BYETTA ( n = 121 ) or placebo ( n = 112 ) was added to existing thiazolidinedione ( pioglitazone or rosiglitazone ) treatment , with or without metformin .
Randomization to BYETTA or placebo was stratified based on whether the patients were receiving metformin .
BYETTA treatment was initiated at a dose of 5 mcg BID for 4 weeks then increased to 10 mcg BID for 12 more weeks .
Patients assigned to placebo received placebo BID throughout the study .
BYETTA or placebo was injected subcutaneously before the morning and evening meals .
In this trial , 79 % of patients were taking a thiazolidinedione and metformin and 21 % were taking a thiazolidinedione alone .
The majority of patients ( 84 % ) were Caucasian , 8 % were Hispanic and 3 % were Black .
The mean baseline HbA1c values were 7 . 9 % for BYETTA and placebo .
The primary endpoint in each study was the mean change in HbA1c from baseline to study end ( or early discontinuation ) .

HbA1c The addition of BYETTA to a regimen of metformin , a sulfonylurea , or both , resulted in statistically significant reductions from baseline in HbA1c compared with patients receiving placebo added to these agents in the three controlled trials ( Table 7 ) .
In the 16 - week trial of BYETTA add - on to thiazolidinediones , with or without metformin , BYETTA resulted in statistically significant reductions from baseline in HbA1c compared with patients receiving placebo ( Table 7 ) .
Postprandial Glucose Postprandial glucose was measured after a mixed meal tolerance test in 9 . 5 % of patients participating in the 30 - week add - on to metformin , add - on to sulfonylurea , and add - on to metformin in combination with sulfonylurea clinical trials .
In this pooled subset of patients , BYETTA reduced postprandial plasma glucose concentrations in a dose - dependent manner .
The mean ( SD ) change in 2 - h postprandial glucose concentration following administration of BYETTA at Week 30 relative to baseline was - 63 ( 65 ) mg / dL for 5 mcg BID ( n = 42 ) , - 71 ( 73 ) mg / dL for 10 mcg BID ( n = 52 ) , and + 11 ( 69 ) mg / dL for placebo BID ( n = 44 ) .
14 . 3 Combination with Insulin Glargine A 30 - week , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BYETTA ( n = 137 ) versus placebo ( n = 122 ) when added to titrated insulin glargine , with or without metformin and / or thiazolidinedione , in patients with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control .
All patients assigned to BYETTA initially received 5 mcg BID for 4 weeks .
After 4 weeks , those patients assigned to BYETTA had their dose increased to 10 mcg BID .
Patients assigned to placebo received placebo BID throughout the trial .
BYETTA or placebo was injected subcutaneously before the morning and evening meals .
Patients with an HbA1c ≤ 8 . 0 % decreased their prestudy dose of insulin glargine by 20 % and patients with an HbA1c ≥ 8 . 1 % maintained their current dose of insulin glargine .
Five weeks after initiating randomized treatment , insulin doses were titrated with guidance from the investigator toward predefined fasting glucose targets according to the dose titration algorithm provided in Table 9 .
The majority of patients ( 78 % ) were Caucasian , 10 % were American Indian or Alaska Native , 9 % were Black , 3 % were Asian , and 0 . 8 % were of multiple origins .
The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 30 .
Compared to placebo , BYETTA 10 mcg BID resulted in statistically significant reductions in HbA1c from baseline at Week 30 ( Table 8 ) in patients receiving titrated insulin glargine .

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Patients should be advised that BYETTA pens are never to be shared with another patient .
Patients should be informed of the potential risks and benefits of BYETTA and of alternative modes of therapy .
Patients should also be fully informed about self - management practices , including the importance of proper storage of BYETTA , injection technique , timing of dosage of BYETTA and concomitant oral drugs , adherence to meal planning , regular physical activity , periodic blood glucose monitoring and HbA1c testing , recognition and management of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia , and assessment for diabetes complications .
17 . 1 Risk of Pancreatitis Patients should be informed that persistent severe abdominal pain that may radiate to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting , is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis .
Patients should be instructed to promptly discontinue BYETTA and contact their physician if persistent severe abdominal pain occurs [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
17 . 2 Risk of Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when BYETTA is used in combination with a sulfonylurea .
Therefore , patients receiving BYETTA and a sulfonylurea may require a lower dose of the sulfonylurea to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia .
Patients should be informed that it is also possible that the use of BYETTA with other glucose - independent insulin secretagogues ( e . g . , meglitinides ) could increase the risk of hypoglycemia .
When BYETTA is used in combination with insulin , evaluate the dose of insulin .
Consider reducing the dose of insulin in patients at increased risk of hypoglycemia [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Patients treated with BYETTA should be informed that the concurrent use of BYETTA with prandial insulin has not been studied and cannot be recommended .
