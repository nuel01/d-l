DESCRIPTION The barbiturates are nonselective central nervous system ( CNS ) depressants primarily used as sedative - hypnotics .
In subhypnotic doses , they are also used as anticonvulsants .
The barbiturates and their sodium salts are subject to control under the Federal Controlled Substances Act .
Phenobarbital is a barbituric acid derivative for oral administration and occurs as a white , odorless , slightly bitter powder that is soluble in chloroform , freely soluble in alcohol or ether , and slightly soluble in water .
Its saturated solution has a pH of about 5 . 6 .
Chemically , it is 5 - ethyl - 5 - phenylbarbituric acid with the molecular formula C 12 H 12 N 2 O 3 ( 232 . 24 ) .
The structural formula is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Each Phenobarbital Tablet , USP contains 15 mg , 16 . 2 mg , 30 mg , 32 . 4 mg , 60 mg , 64 . 8 mg , 97 . 2 mg , or 100 mg of phenobarbital , USP .
Inactive ingredients are as follows : Microcrystalline Cellulose ; Lactose Monohydrate ; Sodium Starch Glycolate , Type - A ; Colloidal Silicon Dioxide ; Magnesium Stearate [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Phenobarbital , a long - acting barbiturate , is a central nervous system depressant .
In ordinary doses , the drug acts as a sedative and anticonvulsant .
Its onset of action occurs within 30 minutes , and the duration of action ranges from 5 to 6 hours .
It is detoxified in the liver .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenobarbital Tablets , USP are indicated for use as a sedative or anticonvulsant .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Phenobarbital is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to barbiturates .
In such patients , severe hepatic damage can occur from ordinary doses and is usually associated with dermatitis and involvement of parenchymatous organs .
A personal or familial history of acute intermittent porphyria represents one of the few absolute contraindications to the use of barbiturates .
Phenobarbital is also contraindicated in patients with marked impairment of liver function , or respiratory disease in which dyspnea or obstruction is evident .
It should not be administered to persons with known previous addiction to the sedative / hypnotic group , since ordinary doses may be ineffectual and may contribute to further addiction .
WARNINGS In small doses , the barbiturates may increase the reaction to painful stimuli .
Taken by themselves , the barbiturates cannot be relied upon to relieve pain or even to produce sedation or sleep in the presence of severe pain .
PRECAUTIONS General Precautions Barbiturates induce liver microsomal enzyme activity .
This accelerates the biotransformation of various drugs and is probably part of the mechanism of the tolerance encountered with barbiturates .
Phenobarbital , therefore , should be used with caution in patients with decreased liver function .
This drug should also be administered cautiously to patients with a history of drug dependence or abuse ( see DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE ) .
Phenobarbital may decrease the potency of coumarin anticoagulants ; therefore , patients receiving such concomitant therapy should have more frequent prothrombin determinations .
As with other sedatives and hypnotics , elderly or debilitated patients may react to barbiturates with marked excitement , depression , or confusion .
The systemic effects of exogenous hydrocortisone and endogenous hydrocortisone ( cortisol ) may be diminished by phenobarbital .
Thus , this product should be administered with caution to patients with borderline hypoadrenal function , regardless of whether it is of pituitary or of primary adrenal origin .
Information for Patients Phenobarbital may impair the mental and / or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks , such as driving a car or operating machinery .
The patient should be cautioned accordingly .
Drug Interactions Phenobarbital in combination with alcohol , tranquilizers , and other central nervous system depressants has additive depressant effects , and the patient should be so advised .
Patients taking this drug should be warned not to exceed the dosage recommended by their physician .
Toxic effects and fatalities have occurred following overdoses of phenobarbital alone and in combination with other central nervous system depressants .
Caution should be exercised in prescribing unnecessarily large amounts of phenobarbital for patients who have a history of emotional disturbances or suicidal ideation or who have misused alcohol and other CNS drugs ( see OVERDOSAGE ) .
Usage in Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in animals and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to phenobarbital .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed and under the supervision of a physician .
Nursing Mothers Caution should be exercised when phenobarbital is administered to a nursing woman .
ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been reported : CNS Depression : Residual sedation or " hangover , " drowsiness , lethargy , and vertigo .
Emotional disturbances and phobias may be accentuated .
In some persons , barbiturates such as phenobarbital repeatedly produce excitement rather than depression , and the patient may appear to be inebriated .
Like other nonanalgesic hypnotic drugs , barbiturates , such as phenobarbital , when given in the presence of pain , may cause restlessness , excitement , and even delirium .
Rarely , the use of barbiturates results in localized or diffused myalgic , neuralgic , or arthritic pain , especially in psychoneurotic patients with insomnia .
The pain may appear in paroxysms , is most intense in the early morning hours , and is most frequently located in the region of the neck , shoulder girdle , and upper limbs .
Symptoms may last for days after the drug is discontinued .
Respiratory / Circulatory : Respiratory depression , apnea , circulatory collapse .
Allergic : Acquired hypersensitivity to barbiturates consists chiefly in allergic reactions that occur especially in persons who tend to have asthma , urticaria , angioedema , and similar conditions .
Hypersensitivity reactions in this category include localized swelling , particularly of the eyelids , cheeks , or lips , and erythematous dermatitis .
Rarely , exfoliative dermatitis ( e . g . , Stevens - Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis ) may be caused by phenobarbital and can prove fatal .
The skin eruption may be associated with fever , delirium , and marked degenerative changes in the liver and other parenchymatous organs .
In a few cases , megaloblastic anemia has been associated with the chronic use of phenobarbital .
Other : Nausea and vomiting ; headache .

DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance Phenobarbital is a Schedule IV drug .
Dependence Prolonged , uninterrupted use of barbiturates ( particularly the short - acting drugs ) , even in therapeutic doses , may result in psychic and physical dependence .
Withdrawal symptoms due to physical dependence following chronic use of large doses of barbiturates may include delirium , convulsions , and death .
OVERDOSAGE The signs and symptoms of barbiturate poisoning are referable especially to the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system .
Moderate intoxication resembles alcoholic inebriation .
In severe intoxication , the patient is comatose , the level of reflex activity conforming in a general way to the intensity of the central depression .
The deep reflexes may persist for some time despite coexistent coma .
The Babinski sign is often positive .
The EEG may be of the " burst - suppression " type , with brief periods of electrical silence .
The pupils may be constricted and react to light , but late in the course of barbiturate poisoning they may show hypoxic paralytic dilatation .
Respiration is affected early .
Breathing may be either slow or rapid and shallow ; Cheyne - Stokes rhythm may be present .
Respiratory minute volume is diminished , and hypoxia and respiratory acidosis may develop .
The blood pressure falls , owing partly to depression of medullary vasomotor centers ; partly to a direct action of the drug on the myocardium , sympathetic ganglia , and vascular smooth muscle ; partly to hypoxia .
The patient thus develops a typical shock syndrome , with a weak and rapid pulse , cold and clammy skin , and a rise in the hematocrit .
Respiratory complications ( atelectasis , pulmonary edema , and bronchopneumonia ) and renal failure are much dreaded and not infrequent concomitant of severe barbiturate poisoning .
There is usually hypothermia , sometimes with temperatures as low as 32 ° C . Treatment General management should consist of symptomatic and supportive therapy , including gastric lavage , administration of intravenous fluids , and maintenance of blood pressure , body temperature and adequate respiratory exchange .
Dialysis will increase the rate of removal of barbiturates from the body fluids .
Antibiotics may be required to control pulmonary complications .
