[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Microbiology Erythromycin inhibits protein synthesis without affecting nucleic acid synthesis .
Erythromycin is usually active against the following organisms in vitro and in clinical infections : Streptococcus pyogenes ( group A β - hemolytic ) , Alpha - hemolytic streptococci ( viridans group ) ; Staphylococcus aureus , including penicillinase - producing strains ( methicillin - resistant staphylococci are uniformly resistant to erythromycin ) ; Streptococcus pneumoniae ; Mycoplasma pneumoniae ( Eaton Agent , PPLO ) ; Haemophilus influenzae ( not all strains of this organism are susceptible at the erythromycin concentrations ordinarily achieved ) ; Treponema pallidum ; Corynebacterium diphtheriae ; Neisseria gonorrhoeae ; Chlamydia trachomatis .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE For the treatment of superficial ocular infections involving the conjunctiva and / or cornea caused by organisms susceptible to erythromycin .
For prophylaxis of ophthalmia neonatorum due to N . gonorrhoeae or C . trachomatis .
The effectiveness of erythromycin in the prevention of ophthalmia caused by penicillinase - producing N . gonorrhoeae is not established .
For infants born to mothers with clinically apparent gonorrhea , intravenous or intramuscular injections of aqueous crystalline penicillin G should be given ; a single dose of 50 , 000 units for term infants or 20 , 000 units for infants of low birth weight .
Topical prophylaxis alone is inadequate for these infants .

Information for Patients : Avoid contaminating the applicator tip with material from the eye , fingers , or other source .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Two year oral studies conducted in rats with erythromycin did not provide evidence of tumorigenicity .
Mutagenicity studies have not been conducted .
No evidence of impaired fertility that appeared related to erythromycin was reported in animal studies .
Pregnancy : Pregnancy Category B . Reproduction studies have been performed in rats , mice , and rabbits using erythromycin and its various salts and esters , at doses that were several multiples of the usual human dose .
No evidence of harm to the fetus that appeared related to erythromycin was reported in these studies .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response , the erythromycins should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
