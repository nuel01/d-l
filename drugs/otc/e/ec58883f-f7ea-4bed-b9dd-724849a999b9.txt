1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Acetylcysteine injection is indicated to prevent or lessen hepatic injury after ingestion of a potentially hepatotoxic quantity of acetaminophen in patients with acute ingestion or from repeated supratherapeutic ingestion ( RSI ) .
Acetylcysteine injection is an antidote for acetaminophen overdose indicated to prevent or lessen hepatic injury after ingestion of a potentially hepatotoxic quantity of acetaminophen in patients with an acute ingestion or from repeated supratherapeutic ingestion ( RSI ) ( 1 ) .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Pre - Treatment Assessment Following Acute Ingestion ( 2 . 1 ) : Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion .
• • If the time of acetaminophen ingestion is unknown : • oAdminister a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately .
• oObtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment .
• • If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained ( or is unavailable or uninterpretable ) within the 8 - hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity : • oAdminister a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately and continue treatment for a total of three doses over 21 hours .
• • If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known : • oAdminister a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately .
• oObtain acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment .
• • If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known : • oUse the Rumack - Matthew nomogram ( Figure 1 ) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine injection ( 2 . 2 ) Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatotoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2 . 2 ) : • • See Full Prescribing Information for instructions on how to use the nomogram to determine the need for dosing .
Preparation and Storage of Diluted Solution Prior to Administration ( 2 . 3 ) : Acetylcysteine injection is hyperosmolar ( 2600 mOsmol / L ) , therefore acetylcysteine injection must be diluted in sterile water for injection , 0 . 45 % sodium chloride injection , or 5 % dextrose in water injection prior to intravenous administration .
See Full Prescribing Information for examples of osmolarity depending on the type of solution and ACETADOTE concentration .
Recommended Adult and Pediatric Dosage ( 2 . 4 ) : • • Acetylcysteine injection is for intravenous administration only • • Total dosage of acetylcysteine injection is 300 mg / kg given intravenously as 3 separate doses and total recommended infusion time for 3 doses is 21 hours • • See Full Prescribing Information for weight - based dosage and weight - based dilution ( 2 . 4 ) • • See Full Prescribing Information for recommendations for continuing acetylcysteine injection treatment after 21 hours ( 2 . 2 ) Repeated Supratherapeutic Acetaminophen Ingestion ( 2 . 5 ) : Obtain acetaminophen concentration and other laboratory tests to guide treatment ; Rumack - Matthew nomogram does not apply .
2 . 1 Pre - Treatment Assessment and Testing Following Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion The following recommendations are related to acute acetaminophen ingestion .
For recommendations related to repeated supratherapeutic exposure see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) .
1 .
Assess the history and timing of acetaminophen ingestion as an overdose .
• • The reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested as an overdose is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy .
2 .
Obtain the following laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance : aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , bilirubin , international normalized ratio ( INR ) , creatinine , blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , blood glucose , and electrolytes .
3 .
Obtain a plasma or serum sample to assay for acetaminophen concentration at least 4 hours after ingestion .
Acetaminophen concentrations obtained earlier than 4 hours post - ingestion may be misleading as they may not represent maximum acetaminophen concentrations .
4 .
If the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is unknown : • • Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
• • Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
5 .
If the acetaminophen concentration cannot be obtained ( or is unavailable or uninterpretable ) within the 8 - hour time interval after acetaminophen ingestion or there is clinical evidence of acetaminophen toxicity : • • Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately and continue treatment for a total of three doses over 21 hours [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
6 .
If the patient presents more than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known : • • Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection immediately [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] • • Obtain an acetaminophen concentration to determine need for continued treatment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
7 .
If the patient presents less than 8 hours after ingestion and the time of acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the acetaminophen concentration is known : • • Use the Rumack - Matthew nomogram ( Figure 1 ) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine injection [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
2 . 2 Nomogram for Estimating Potential for Hepatoxicity from Acute Acetaminophen Ingestion and Need for Acetylcysteine Injection Treatment Acetylcysteine injection is an antidote for acetaminophen overdose .
The critical ingestion - treatment interval for maximal protection against severe hepatic injury is between 0 – 8 hours .
Efficacy diminishes progressively after 8 hours and treatment initiation between 15 and 24 hours post - ingestion of acetaminophen yields limited efficacy .
However , it does not appear to worsen the condition of patients and it should not be withheld , since the reported time of ingestion may not be correct .
If the timing of the acute acetaminophen ingestion is known and the results of the acetaminophen assay are available within 8 hours : • • Refer to the Rumack - Matthew nomogram ( see Figure 1 ) to determine whether or not to initiate treatment with acetylcysteine injection .
• • Initiation of acetylcysteine injection depends on the plasma or serum acetaminophen concentration and also the clinical presentation of the patient .
The nomogram may underestimate the hepatotoxicity risk in patients with chronic alcoholism , malnutrition , or CYP2E1 enzyme inducing drugs ( e . g . , isoniazid ) , and consideration should be given to treating these patients even if the acetaminophen concentrations are in the nontoxic range .
Loading dose For patients whose acetaminophen concentrations are at or above the “ possible ” toxicity line ( dotted line in nomogram ) : • • Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
For patients with an acute overdose from an extended - release acetaminophen , if the acetaminophen concentration at 4 hours post ingestion is below the possible toxicity line then obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration 8 to 10 hours after the acute ingestion .
If the second value is at or above the “ possible ” toxicity line ( dotted line in nomogram ) : • • Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
For patients whose values are below the “ possible ” toxicity line , but time of ingestion was unknown or sample was obtained less than 4 hours after ingestion : • • Administer a loading dose of acetylcysteine injection [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
For patients whose values are below the “ possible ” toxicity line and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion , do not administer acetylcysteine injection because there is minimal risk of hepatotoxicity .

Choose ONE of the following based on the acetaminophen concentration : The acetaminophen concentration is above the possible toxicity line according to the nomogram ( see Figure 1 ) : • • Continue acetylcysteine injection treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion period of 21 hours [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
• • Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment .
The acetaminophen concentration could not be obtained : • • Continue acetylcysteine injection treatment with the maintenance dose for a total of three separate doses over an infusion period of 21 hours [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
• • Monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolytes throughout treatment .
For patients whose acetaminophen concentration is below the “ possible ” toxicity line ( see Figure 1 ) and time of ingestion is known and the sample was obtained more than 4 hours after ingestion : • • Discontinue acetylcysteine injection .
The acetaminophen concentration was in the non - toxic range , but time of ingestion was unknown or less than 4 hours : • • Obtain a second sample for acetaminophen concentration and consider the patient ’ s clinical status to decide whether or not to continue acetylcysteine injection treatment .
• • If there is any uncertainty as to patient ’ s risk of developing hepatotoxicity , it is recommended to administer a complete treatment course .
Continued Therapy After Completion of Loading and Maintenance Doses In cases of suspected massive overdose , or with concomitant ingestion of other substances , or in patients with preexisting liver disease ; the absorption and / or the half - life of acetaminophen may be prolonged .
In such cases , consideration should be given to the need for continued treatment with acetylcysteine injection beyond a total of three separate doses over a 21 - hour infusion period .
Acetaminophen levels and ALT / AST and INR should be checked after the last maintenance dose .
If acetaminophen levels are still detectable , or if the ALT / AST are still increasing or the INR remains elevated ; dosing should be continued and the treating physician should contact a US regional poison center at 1 - 800 - 222 - 1222 , alternatively , a “ special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose ” at 1 - 800 - 525 - 6115 for assistance with dosing recommendations , or 1 - 877 - 484 - 2700 for additional information .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 2 . 3 Preparation and Storage of Acetylcysteine Injection Diluted Solution Prior to Administration Because acetylcysteine injection is hyperosmolar ( 2600 mOsmol / L ) , acetylcysteine injection must be diluted in sterile water for injection , 0 . 45 % sodium chloride injection ( 1 / 2 normal saline ) , or 5 % dextrose in water prior to intravenous administration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Dilution in these three solutions results in different osmolarity of the solution for intravenous administration ( see Table 1 for examples of different osmolarity of the solution depending on the type of solution and the acetylcysteine injection concentration ) .
Visually inspect for particular matter and discoloration prior to administration .
The color of the diluted solution ranges from colorless to a slight pink or purple once the stopper is punctured ( the color change does not affect the quality of the product ) .
The diluted solution can be stored for 24 hours at room temperature .
Discard unused portion .
If a vial was previously opened , do not use for intravenous administration .

** No specific studies have been conducted to evaluate the necessity of dose adjustments in patients weighing over 100 kg .
Limited information is available regarding the dosing requirements of patients that weigh more than 100 kg .
2 . 5 Recommendations for Repeated Supratherapeutic Acetaminophen Ingestion Repeated supratherapeutic acetaminophen ingestion ( RSI ) is an ingestion of acetaminophen at dosages higher than those recommended for extended periods of time .
The risk of hepatotoxicity and the recommendations for treatment of acute acetaminophen ingestion ( i . e . , the Rumack - Matthew nomogram ) do not apply to patients with RSI .
Therefore , obtain the following information to guide acetylcysteine injection treatment for RSI : • • Acetaminophen serum or plasma concentrations .
A reported history of the quantity of acetaminophen ingested is often inaccurate and is not a reliable guide to therapy .
• • Laboratory tests to monitor hepatic and renal function and electrolyte and fluid balance : AST , ALT , bilirubin , INR , creatinine , BUN , blood glucose , and electrolytes .
For specific acetylcysteine injection dosage and administration information in patients with RSI , consider contacting your regional poison center at 1 - 800 - 222 - 1222 , or alternatively , a special health professional assistance line for acetaminophen overdose at 1 - 800 - 525 - 6115 .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Injection : 200 mg / mL ( 6 grams of acetylcysteine in 30 mL ) in a single - dose vial .
Injection : 6 grams / 30 mL ( 200 mg / mL ) in a single - dose vial 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Acetylcysteine injection is contraindicated in patients with a previous hypersensitivity reaction to acetylcysteine [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Patients with a previous hypersensitivity reaction to acetylcysteine 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Hypersensitivity Reactions , Including Hypotension , Wheezing , Shortness of Breath and Bronchospasm : Observe patients during and after the infusion ; immediately discontinue infusion if a serious reaction occurs and initiate appropriate treatment .
Acetylcysteine injection infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of hypersensitivity has been initiated ( 5 . 1 ) .
• • Fluid Overload : Total volume administered should be reduced for patients weighing less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction ( 5 . 2 ) .
5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions during acetylcysteine administration including rash , hypotension , wheezing , and / or shortness of breath , have been observed in patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine for acetaminophen overdose and occurred soon after initiation of the infusion [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs , immediately stop the infusion of acetylcysteine injection and initiate appropriate treatment .
One patient with asthma developed bronchospasm and died after intravenous administration of acetylcysteine .
Acetylcysteine injection should be used with caution in patients with asthma , or where there is a history of bronchospasm .
Patients with asthma should be closely monitored during initiation of acetylcysteine injection therapy and throughout acetylcysteine injection therapy .
Acute flushing and erythema of the skin may occur in patients receiving acetylcysteine intravenously .
These reactions usually occur 30 to 60 minutes after initiating the infusion and often resolve spontaneously despite continued infusion of acetylcysteine .
If a reaction to acetylcysteine involves more than simply flushing and erythema of the skin , it should be treated as a hypersensitivity reaction .
Management of less severe hypersensitivity reactions should be based upon the severity of the reaction and include temporary interruption of the infusion and / or administration of antihistaminic drugs .
The acetylcysteine injection infusion may be carefully restarted after treatment of the hypersensitivity symptoms has been initiated ; however , if the hypersensitivity reaction returns upon re - initiation of treatment or increases in severity , acetylcysteine injection should be discontinued and alternative patient management should be considered .
5 . 2 Fluid Overload The total volume of acetylcysteine injection administered should be adjusted for patients less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction .
To avoid fluid overload , the volume of diluent should be reduced as needed [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
If volume is not adjusted fluid overload can occur , potentially resulting in hyponatremia , seizure and death .
Intravenous administration of acetylcysteine injection can cause fluid overload , potentially resulting in hyponatremia , seizure and death .
To avoid fluid overload , use the recommended dilution shown in Tables 2 , 3 and 4 [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions ( > 2 % ) are rash , urticaria / facial flushing and pruritus ( 6 . 1 ) .
To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Perrigo at 1 - 866 - 634 - 9120 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In the literature the most frequently reported adverse reactions attributed to intravenous acetylcysteine administration were rash , urticaria and pruritus .
The frequency of adverse reactions has been reported to be between 0 . 2 % and 21 % , and they most commonly occur during the initial loading dose of acetylcysteine .
Loading Dose / Infusion Rate Study In a randomized , open - label , multi - center clinical study conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning , the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between a 15 - minute and 60 - minute intravenous infusion for the 150 mg / kg loading dose of acetylcysteine were compared .
The incidence of drug - related adverse reactions occurring within the first 2 hours following acetylcysteine administration is presented in Table 5 .
Overall , 17 % of patients developed an acute hypersensitivity reaction ( 18 % in the 15 - minute infusion group ; 14 % in the 60 - minute infusion group ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published case reports and case series of pregnant women exposed to acetylcysteine during various trimesters are not sufficient to inform any drug associated risk .
Delaying treatment of acetaminophen overdose may increase the risk of maternal or fetal morbidity and mortality [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits following oral administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis at doses similar to the total intravenous dose ( based on the body surface area ) did not cause any adverse effects to the fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - Associated Maternal and / or Embryo / Fetal Risk Acetaminophen and acetylcysteine cross the placenta .
Delaying treatment in pregnant women with acetaminophen overdose and potentially toxic acetaminophen plasma levels may increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality .
Data Animal Data Reproduction studies have been performed following administration of acetylcysteine during the period of organogenesis in rats at oral doses up to 2000 mg / kg / day ( 1 . 1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg / kg based on body surface area comparison ) and in rabbits at oral doses up to 1000 mg / kg / day ( 1 . 1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg / kg based on body surface area comparison ) .
No adverse developmental outcomes due to acetylcysteine were observed .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of acetylcysteine in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for acetylcysteine injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from acetylcysteine injection or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations Based on the pharmacokinetic data , acetylcysteine should be nearly completely cleared 30 hours after administration .
Breastfeeding women may consider pumping and discarding their milk for 30 hours after administration .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of acetylcysteine injection in pediatric patients have not been established by adequate and well - controlled studies .
Use of acetylcysteine injection in pediatric patients 5 kg and greater is based on clinical practice [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE An initial 150 mg / kg dose of acetylcysteine for a patient weighting 106 kg was mistakenly calculated as 160 g ( a decimal point error resulting in a 10 - fold higher than prescribed dose ) .
An hour after the infusion started , the patient complained of generalized heat sensation and body pain and developed widespread urticaria and hypotension .
The second acetylcysteine infusion was withheld and the patient was treated for anaphylaxis .
Despite treatment the patient subcomed to the acute inflammatory reaction and died .
Single intravenous doses of acetylcysteine at 1000 mg / kg in mice , 2445 mg / kg in rats , 1500 mg / kg in guinea pigs , 1200 mg / kg in rabbits and 500 mg / kg in dogs were lethal .
Symptoms of acute toxicity in the animals were ataxia , hypoactivity , labored respiration , cyanosis , loss of righting reflex and convulsions .
11 DESCRIPTION Acetylcysteine injection is an intravenous antidote for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose .
Acetylcysteine is the nonproprietary name for the N - acetyl derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid , L - cysteine ( N - acetyl - L - cysteine , ) .
The compound is a white crystalline powder , which melts in the range of 104 ° to 110 ° C and has a very slight odor .
The molecular formula of the compound is C5H9NO3S , and its molecular weight is 163 . 2 .
Acetylcysteine has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Acetylcysteine injection is supplied as a sterile solution in vials containing 20 % w / v ( 200 mg / mL ) acetylcysteine .
The pH of the solution ranges from 6 . 0 to 7 . 5 .
Acetylcysteine injection contains the following inactive ingredients : sodium hydroxide ( used for pH adjustment ) , and Sterile Water for Injection , USP .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Acetylcysteine has been shown to reduce the extent of liver injury following acetaminophen overdose .
Acetaminophen doses of 150 mg / kg or greater have been associated with hepatotoxicity .
Acetylcysteine probably protects the liver by maintaining or restoring the glutathione levels , or by acting as an alternate substrate for conjugation with , and thus detoxification of , the reactive metabolite of acetaminophen .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics After a single intravenous dose of acetylcysteine , the plasma concentration of total acetylcysteine declined in a poly - exponential decay manner with a mean terminal half - life ( T1 / 2 ) of 5 . 6 hours .
The mean clearance ( CL ) for acetylcysteine was 0 . 11 liter / hr / kg and renal CL constituted about 30 % of the total CL .
Distribution : The steady - state volume of distribution ( Vdss ) following administration of an intravenous dose of acetylcysteine was 0 . 47 liter / kg .
The protein binding of acetylcysteine ranges from 66 to 87 % .
Elimination Metabolism : Acetylcysteine ( i . e . , N - acetylcysteine ) is postulated to form cysteine and disulfides ( N , N - diacetylcysteine and N - acetylcysteine ) .
Cysteine is further metabolized to form glutathione and other metabolites .
Excretion After a single oral dose of [ 35 S ] - acetylcysteine 100 mg , between 13 to 38 % of the total radioactivity administered was recovered in urine within 24 hours .
In a separate study , renal clearance was estimated to be approximately 30 % of total body clearance .
Specific Populations : Hepatic Impairment : Following a 600 mg intravenous dose of acetylcysteine to subjects with mild ( Child Pugh Class A , n = 1 ) , moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B , n = 4 ) or severe ( Child - Pugh Class C ; n = 4 ) hepatic impairment and 6 healthy matched controls , mean T1 / 2 increased by 80 % .
Also , the mean CL decreased by 30 % and the systemic acetylcysteine exposure ( mean AUC ) increased 1 . 6 - fold in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function .
These changes are not considered to be clinically meaningful .
Renal Impairment Hemodialysis may remove some of total acetylcysteine .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of acetylcysteine .
Acetylcysteine was not genotoxic in the Ames test or the in vivo mouse micronucleus test .
It was , however , positive in the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell ( L5178Y / TK + / - ) forward mutation test .
Treatment of male rats with acetylcysteine at an oral dose of 250 mg / kg / day for 15 weeks ( 0 . 1 times the recommended total human intravenous dose of 300 mg / kg based on body surface comparison ) did not affect the fertility or general reproductive performance .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Loading Dose / Infusion Rate Study A randomized , open - label , multi - center clinical study was conducted in Australia in patients with acetaminophen poisoning to compare the rates of hypersensitivity reactions between two rates of infusion for the intravenous acetylcysteine loading dose .
One hundred nine subjects were randomized to a 15 - minute infusion rate and seventy - one subjects were randomized to a 60 minute infusion rate .
The loading dose was 150 mg / kg followed by a maintenance dose of 50 mg / kg over 4 hours and then 100 mg / kg over 16 hours .
Of the 180 patients , 27 % were male and 73 % were female .
Ages ranged from 15 to 83 years , with the mean age being 30 years ( ± 13 . 0 ) .
A subgroup of 58 subjects ( 33 in the 15 - minute infusion group ; 25 in the 60 - minute infusion group ) was treated within 8 hours of acetaminophen ingestion .
No hepatotoxicity occurred within this subgroup ; however , with 95 % confidence , the true hepatotoxicity rates could range from 0 % to 9 % for the 15 - minute infusion group and from 0 % to 12 % for the 60 - minute infusion group .
Observational Study An open - label , observational database contained information on 1749 patients who sought treatment for acetaminophen overdose over a 16 - year period .
Of the 1749 patients , 65 % were female , 34 % were male and less than 1 % was transgender .
Ages ranged from 2 months to 96 years , with 72 % of the patients falling in the 16 to 40 - year - old age bracket .
A total of 399 patients received acetylcysteine treatment .
A post - hoc analysis identified 56 patients who ( 1 ) were at high or probable risk for hepatotoxicity ( APAP greater than 150 mg / L at the four hours line according to the Australian nomogram ) and ( 2 ) had a liver function test .
Of the 53 patients who were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine ( 300 mg / kg intravenous acetylcysteine administered over 20 - 21 hours ) within 8 hours , two ( 4 % ) developed hepatotoxicity ( AST or ALT greater than 1000 U / L ) .
Twenty - one of 48 ( 44 % ) patients treated with acetylcysteine after 15 hours developed hepatotoxicity .
The actual number of hepatotoxicity outcomes may be higher than what is reported here .
For patients with multiple admissions for acetaminophen overdose , only the first overdose treated with intravenous acetylcysteine was examined .
Hepatotoxicity may have occurred in subsequent admissions .
Evaluable data were available from a total of 148 pediatric patients ( less than 16 years of age ) who were admitted for poisoning following ingestion of acetaminophen , of whom 23 were treated with intravenous acetylcysteine .
There were no deaths of pediatric patients .
None of the pediatric patients receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity while two patients not receiving intravenous acetylcysteine developed hepatotoxicity .
The number of pediatric patients is too small to provide a statistically significant finding of efficacy ; however the results appear to be consistent to those observed for adults .
