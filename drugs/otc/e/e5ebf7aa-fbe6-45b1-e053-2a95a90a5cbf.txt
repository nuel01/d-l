One silver nitrate applicator is generally sufficient for each application .
The action of the silver nitrate can be stopped by washing the area with saline solution ( 0 . 9 % sodium chloride ) .
Using saline solution to wet the applicator tips , or residual saline from wound flushing / washing will interfere with the action of silver nitrate resulting in cauterization failure .
Only use distilled , deionized or purified water to wet applicator tips .
Blot dry wounds that have been flushed / washed with saline prior to applying silver nitrate .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Silver salts stain tissue black due to deposition of reduced silver .
The stain gradually disappears within a period of two weeks .
Prolonged ingestion or absorption of silver compounds leads to deposition of silver in connective tissues , producing a slate - blue discoloration of the skin known as argyria .
