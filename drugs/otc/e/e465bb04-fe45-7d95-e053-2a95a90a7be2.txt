• Discontinue the infusion immediately if the patient experiences a severe systemic reaction , including anaphylaxis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 3 Preparation Instructions Prepare MEPSEVII according to the following steps using aseptic technique : 1 .
Determine the number of vials to be diluted based on the patient ’ s actual weight and the recommended dose of 4 mg / kg , using the following calculations ( a - b ) : a . Total dose ( mg ) = Patient ’ s weight ( kg ) x 4 mg / kg ( recommended dose ) b . Total number of vials = Total dose ( mg ) divided by 10 mg / vial 2 .
Round to the next whole vial and remove the required number of vials from the refrigerator to allow them to reach room temperature .
Do not heat , microwave or shake vials .
a . Volume ( mL ) of calculated dose = Total dose ( mg ) divided by the 2 mg / mL concentration 3 .
The final solution will be a 1 : 1 dilution of MEPSEVII with 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP .
More than 1 : 1 dilution may be used if the patient can tolerate additional infusion volume , taking into consideration cardiac function and fluid status .
4 .
For a 1 : 1 dilution , prepare the solution at room temperature , as follows : a . Select an empty infusion bag , sized upon the total volume of the final solution .
b . Prior to withdrawing MEPSEVII from the vial , visually inspect the solution for particulate matter and discoloration .
Because this is a protein solution , slight flocculation ( thin translucent fibers ) may occur .
The MEPSEVII solution should be colorless to slightly yellow .
Discard if the solution is discolored or if there is particulate matter in the solution .
c . Slowly withdraw the volume of the calculated MEPSEVII dose from the appropriate number of vials ( step 2 a ) using caution to avoid excessive agitation and any air or frothing .
Use a sufficiently large needle ( 18 gauge ) to minimize bubbles in the solution .
d . Slowly add MEPSEVII to the infusion bag using care to avoid agitation , ensuring liquid to liquid contact without generating bubbles or turbulence .
e . Add 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP equal to the volume of MEPSEVII to the infusion bag .
f . Gently rock the infusion bag to ensure proper distribution of MEPSEVII .
Do not shake the solution .
2 . 4 Administration Instructions Administer MEPSEVII as follows : • The rate of infusion : In the first hour infuse 2 . 5 % of the total volume , and infuse the remaining volume over the subsequent three hours ( see Table 1 ) .
Account for any dead space in the lines to ensure 2 . 5 % of the total infusion volume is delivered into the patient ’ s bloodstream during the first hour of infusion .
• Use an infusion set equipped with an in - line , low - protein binding 0 . 2 micron filter to administer the diluted MEPSEVII solution .
• Do not flush the line containing MEPSEVII to avoid a rapid bolus of infused enzyme .
Due to the low infusion rate , additional saline may be added through a separate line ( piggyback or Y tube ) to maintain sufficient intravenous flow to prevent clotting or line blockage .
• Do not infuse with other products in the infusion tubing .
Compatibility with other products has not been evaluated .
• Use MEPSEVII immediately after dilution and complete the infusion within 42 hours from the time of dilution .
Discard any unused product .
Stability If immediate use is not possible , the diluted solution may be stored up to 36 hours under refrigeration at 2 ° C to 8 ° C ( 36 ° F to 46 ° F ) followed by up to 6 hours at room temperature up to a maximum of 25 ° C ( 77 ° F ) .

None ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5 . 1 Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis to MEPSEVII was reported in 2 of 20 patients in the clinical program [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
These reactions occurred during MEPSEVII infusion and were observed as early as the first dose of MEPSEVII for one patient .
Manifestations included respiratory distress , cyanosis , decreased oxygen saturation , and hypotension .
The two patients with anaphylaxis to MEPSEVII during the clinical trials had one occurrence each and tolerated subsequent infusions of MEPSEVII , without recurrence .
Anaphylaxis can be life - threatening .
MEPSEVII should be administered under the supervision of a healthcare professional with the capability to manage anaphylaxis .
Patients should be observed for 60 minutes after MEPSEVII administration .
If severe systemic reactions occur , including anaphylaxis , immediately discontinue the MEPSEVII infusion and provide appropriate medical treatment .
Prior to discharge , inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and instruct them to seek immediate medical care if symptoms occur .
Consider the risks and benefits of re - administering MEPSEVII following anaphylaxis .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling : • Anaphylaxis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 1 patient ) are : Infusion site extravasation , diarrhea , rash , anaphylaxis , infusion site swelling , peripheral swelling and pruritus .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Ultragenyx at 1 - 888 - 756 - 8657 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The MEPSEVII clinical program included 23 patients aged 5 months to 25 years who received treatment with MEPSEVII at doses up to 4 mg / kg once every two weeks for up to 187 weeks .
Nineteen patients were younger than 18 years of age .
Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred in Study 301 , a randomized start trial in 12 patients with MPS VII between the ages of 8 and 25 years [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Adverse reactions in Table 2 occurred in one or more patients treated with MEPSEVII at a dosage of 4 mg / kg at a higher patient frequency than placebo .
Adverse reaction incidence rates are presented in the table below to account for the different duration of exposure to active treatment vs . placebo .
Table 2 .
Adverse Reactions in Patients with MPS VII in Study 301 Adverse Reaction MEPSEVII N = 12 n ( Incidence Rate * ) Placebo N = 9 n ( Incidence Rate * ) Infusion site extravasation 4 ( 0 . 5 ) 1 ( 0 . 4 ) Diarrhea 3 ( 0 . 4 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Rash 3 ( 0 . 4 ) 2 ( 0 . 7 ) Anaphylaxis 2 ( 0 . 2 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Infusion site swelling 1 ( 0 . 1 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Peripheral swelling 1 ( 0 . 1 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Pruritus 1 ( 0 . 1 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) n = number of reactions * Adverse reaction incidence rates calculated per 8 . 3 patient years for exposure to MEPSEVII , and 2 . 7 years of exposure for placebo Febrile Convulsion One patient receiving a dose of 4 mg / kg experienced a febrile convulsion during MEPSEVII treatment at Week 66 .
The infusion was stopped , the patient received anticonvulsants , antipyretics and antibiotics , and the adverse reaction resolved .
The patient subsequently was re - challenged without recurrence and continued on treatment .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is potential for immunogenicity .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies to other vestronidase alfa products may be misleading .
Immunogenicity data were available from 23 patients who received MEPSEVII for up to 187 weeks of treatment .
Eighteen out of 23 ( 78 % ) patients developed anti - vestronidase alfa - vjbk antibodies ( ADA ) .
Ten of the 18 ( 55 . 6 % ) ADA - positive patients were tested positive for neutralizing antibodies ( NAb ) .
There is no correlation between ADA titer and NAb development .
Six treatment - naïve patients had pre - existing ADA titers at baseline .
ADAs were detected in five of these six patients post - treatment .
The post - treatment ADA titers were the same as or below the baseline ADA titer values in two patients , but one of these two patients was positive for NAb .
ADA titer values after treatment increased 64 - fold , 128 - fold , and 364 - fold , respectively , in the other three patients .
The presence of ADA titer did not appear to affect reduction in urinary glycosaminoglycans ( uGAGs ) .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on MEPSEVII use in pregnant women to determine a drug - associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes .
In embryofetal development studies , vestronidase alfa - vjbk administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis showed no adverse developmental outcomes at doses up to 1 . 6 and 10 times , respectively for rats and rabbits , the exposure at the recommended human dose .
In a pre - and post - natal development study in rats , an increased number of stillbirths were observed at exposures less than the recommended human dose ( see Data ) .
The clinical relevance of these animal findings is uncertain .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In embryofetal development studies , vestronidase alfa - vjbk administered intravenously to pregnant rats ( once a week ) and rabbits ( once every 3 days ) during the period of organogenesis showed no adverse developmental outcomes at doses up to 20 mg / kg .
The 20 mg / kg dose in rats and rabbits provides approximately 1 . 6 and 10 times the human exposure ( AUC ) of 57 . 9 hr * mcg / mL at the 4 mg / kg dose administered once every other week , respectively .
In a pre - and post - natal developmental study in rats , vestronidase alfa - vjbk was administered every 3 days from gestation day 7 through lactation day 20 at doses of 2 mg / kg , 6 mg / kg , and 20 mg / kg .
Mortality and adverse clinical signs were observed in the maternal animals at the 20 mg / kg dose ( 1 . 6 times the human exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended human dose of 4 mg / kg ) .
Subsequently , the 20 mg / kg dose was reduced to 12 mg / kg .
Maternal toxicity with mortality in one animal was also observed at the 6 mg / kg dose ( 0 . 17 times the AUC at the recommended human dose of 4 mg / kg ) .
At the 2 mg / kg dose ( 0 . 01 times the AUC at the recommended human dose of 4 mg / kg ) , no adverse effects were observed in the maternal animals ; however , there was a statistically significant decrease in the number of live births and subsequent increase in the number of stillbirths at this dose .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of vestronidase alfa - vjbk in either human or animal milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for MEPSEVII and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from vestronidase alfa - vjbk or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of MEPSEVII have been established in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of MEPSEVII did not include any patients aged 65 and over .
It is not known whether elderly patients respond differently from younger patients .
11 DESCRIPTION Vestronidase alfa - vjbk is a recombinant human lysosomal beta glucuronidase which is a purified human enzyme produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line .
Purified vestronidase alfa - vjbk exists as a homotetramer , with each monomer consisting of 629 amino acids .
The calculated isotope average molecular mass of each non - glycosylated peptide chain is 72 , 562 Da .
The amino acid sequence for vestronidase alfa - vjbk is the same as the amino acid sequence for human beta - glucuronidase ( GUS ) .
MEPSEVII ( vestronidase alfa - vjbk ) injection for intravenous infusion is a sterile , preservative - free , non - pyrogenic , colorless to slightly yellow liquid supplied in a single - dose vial .
Each mL of solution contains vestronidase alfa - vjbk ( 2 mg ) , L - histidine ( 3 . 1 mg ) , polysorbate 20 ( 0 . 1 mg ) , sodium chloride ( 7 . 88 mg ) and sodium phosphate monobasic dihydrate ( 3 . 12 mg ) .
The pH of the solution is 6 . 0 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Mucopolysaccharidosis VII ( MPS VII or Sly syndrome ) is a lysosomal disorder characterized by the deficiency of GUS that results in GAG accumulation in cells throughout the body leading to multisystem tissue and organ damage .
Vestronidase alfa - vjbk is a recombinant form of human GUS and is intended to provide exogenous GUS enzyme for uptake into cellular lysosomes .
Mannose - 6 - phosphate ( M6P ) residues on the oligosaccharide chains allow binding of the enzyme to cell surface receptors , leading to cellular uptake of the enzyme , targeting to lysosomes and subsequent catabolism of accumulated GAGs in affected tissues .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In clinical studies , MEPSEVII treatment resulted in sustained reduction of urinary excretion of GAGs during long - term treatment [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of vestronidase alfa - vjbk were evaluated in a total of 23 MPS VII patients including 19 pediatric patients and 4 adults .
Serum exposures of vestronidase alfa - vjbk appeared to increase approximately proportionally from 1 mg / kg ( 0 . 25 times the approved recommended dosage ) to 2 mg / kg ( 0 . 5 times the approved recommended dosage ) , and 4 mg / kg ( the recommended dosage ) .
After repeated dosing of 4 mg / kg every other week , the mean ± standard deviation of maximal concentration ( Cmax ) was 17 . 3 ± 9 . 6 mcg / mL ( range : 4 . 7 to 35 . 7 mcg / mL ) ; and the mean ± standard deviation of area under the concentration - time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration ( AUC0 - t ) was 50 . 9 ± 32 . 2 mcg * hr / mL ( range : 17 . 4 to 153 mcg * hr / mL ) .
Vestronidase alfa - vjbk concentrations in pediatric patients less than 5 years of age were similar to the concentrations in older children and adults .
Distribution After repeated dosing of 4 mg / kg every other week in MPS VII patients , the mean ± standard deviation of the total volume of distribution ( Vss ) was 251 ± 140 mL / kg ( range : 97 to 598 mL / kg ) .
Elimination After repeated dosing of 4 mg / kg every other week in MPS VII patients , the mean ± standard deviation of the total clearance ( CL ) was 83 . 6 ± 43 . 2 mL / hr / kg ( range : 38 . 3 to 184 mL / hr / kg ) ; the mean ± standard deviation of the elimination half - life ( t1 / 2 ) was 2 . 33 ± 0 . 75 hours ( range : 0 . 86 to 3 . 03 hours ) .
The inter - subject variability ( coefficient of variation ) in total clearance ( CL ) was 52 % .
Metabolism Vestronidase alfa - vjbk is a recombinant human enzyme and is therefore eliminated by proteolytic degradation into small peptides and amino acids .
Excretion No excretion studies have been conducted in humans .
Vestronidase alfa - vjbk is not expected to be eliminated through renal or fecal excretion .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential or studies to evaluate the mutagenic potential have not been performed with vestronidase alfa - vjbk .
Vestronidase alfa - vjbk at intravenous doses up to 20 mg / kg administered weekly to rats prior to mating and after mating on gestation days 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 and 18 ( females ) , [ approximately up to 4 . 5 times ( male rats ) and 1 . 6 times ( female rats ) the human AUC 0 - t of 3440 mcg * min / mL at the 4 mg / kg dose administered once every other week ] was found to have no adverse effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The clinical program for MEPSEVII included 23 patients with MPS VII , 17 of whom were evaluable for efficacy , 20 for safety , and 23 for immunogenicity .
Patients were enrolled in clinical trials and expanded access protocols receiving treatment at doses up to 4 mg / kg once every two weeks for up to 187 weeks .
The patients ranged in age from 5 months to 25 years .
Sixteen patients were younger than 18 years of age .
Studies301 and 202 Study UX003 - CL301 ( referred to as Study 301 , NCT02230566 ) was a randomized start trial of MEPSEVII 4 mg / kg every two weeks in patients with MPS VII .
Twelve patients were randomized to one of four placebo durations before crossing over to active treatment .
Three patients received MEPSEVII immediately for a duration of 48 weeks , 3 patients received placebo for 8 weeks then MEPSEVII for 40 weeks , 3 patients received placebo for 16 weeks then MEPSEVII for 32 weeks , and 3 patients received placebo for 24 weeks then MEPSEVII for 24 weeks .
Of the 12 patients enrolled in the trial , 4 were male and 8 were female and ranged in age from 8 to 25 years ( median 14 years ) .
Nine patients were younger than 18 years of age .
The majority of the patients were white ( 75 % ) , with 50 % of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity .
Patients who were enrolled in Study 301 were eligible to roll over to Study UX003 - CL202 ( referred to as Study 202 , NCT02432144 ) , an open - label extension trial in which patients received additional doses of MEPSEVII at 4 mg / kg intravenously every other week for up to 144 weeks .
Ten patients rolled over directly from the end of Study to Week 0 of Study 202 , while 2 patients ( 17 % ) had treatment gaps before enrolling in Study 202 .
In Study 301 , motor function , forced vital capacity , and visual acuity were assessed after 24 weeks of MEPSEVII treatment and measured against pre - specified minimal important differences .
The extremely small population of patients with MPS VII globally necessitated the enrollment of all patients able to participate resulting in a highly heterogeneous group .
Clinical endpoints were not assessable in some patients due to their extent of disease , age or level of cognition .
Repeated assessments of the six minute walk test ( 6 MWT ) were feasible in ten of 12 patients and are described further below .
Of the three patients who improved on their 6 MWT ( Figure 1 , left panel ) , two also were noted to have improvement in balance and gross motor proficiency as assessed by the Bruininks - Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency ( BOT - 2 ) .
In this trial , the mean difference in 6 MWT distance between MEPSEVII and placebo treatment periods in patients able to perform the test at baseline and subsequent visits through Week 24 is shown in Table 3 .
The mean difference in 6 MWT distance increases with increased treatment duration , however , due to the small size of the trial , standard errors are large .
Table 3 .

Patients who used assistive devices were imputed as zeros in the analysis .
** Number and treatment assignment of patients included in the analysis was based upon a randomized start trial design and patient ability to complete testing .
Due to no placebo period for the three patients who received 48 weeks of MEPSEVII in the first cohort of the randomized start design , more data were available for analyses during the treatment period ( n = 8 ) than during the placebo period ( n = 5 ) .
While data from 8 participants were available at each time point , due to missing observations , the 8 participants were not the same across all time points .
The observed individual 6 MWT distances for the 10 patients who could perform the test in Study 301 and Study 202 through Week 184 are presented in Figure 1 .
The course of three patients with improvement in distance walked of at least 60 meters during the 301 Study compared to the start of MEPSEVII treatment ( Week 0 ) is shown in the left panel ; the relatively stable course in the remaining seven patients , including those who used assistive devices , is shown in the right panel .
Figure 1 .
6 MWT Distance for MPS VII Patients in Studies 301 and 202 [ MULTIMEDIA ] Patient 10 did not use an assistive device at baseline but started using an assistive device post - baseline from Treatment Week 8 .
Patients 6 and 9 consistently used an assistive device at all visits .
A solid line indicates the unassisted assessments and a dotted line indicates the assisted assessments .
Liver and Spleen Volume In Study 301 , imaging by MRI or ultrasound to assess liver and spleen volume was performed in seven of the 12 patients .
Most liver volumes were normal or below normal size at baseline ( mean 1 , 591 mL , range 742 to 2 , 207 mL ) , and on average were unchanged after treatment ( mean 1 , 459 mL , range 876 to 1 , 851 mL ) .
Spleen volumes generally were normal or below normal size at baseline ( mean 325 mL , range 131 to 491 mL ) and on average were unchanged after treatment ( mean 360 mL , range 200 to 582 mL ) .
Study 203 UX003 - CL203 ( referred to as Study 203 ; NCT 02418455 ) was an open - label , uncontrolled single arm study that enrolled 8 patients less than 5 years of age who received MEPSEVII at a dose of 4 mg / kg every two weeks for 48 weeks of treatment and up to an additional 240 weeks during an optional continuation period .
The study evaluated urinary GAG excretion , growth and hepatosplenomegaly .
With long - term treatment , urinary GAG levels remained decreased upon exposure to MEPSEVII .
At baseline , all 8 patients had impaired growth , and height remained near the 5 th percentile relative to age - matched gender norms throughout the trial .
No significant changes in hepatosplenomegaly were observed .
Other Investigations Study UX003 - CL201 ( referred to as Study 201 , NCT01856218 ) was a single arm , open - label , dose exploration trial completed outside the United States that enrolled three MPS VII patients , ranging in age from 5 years to 25 years .
Two patients were male ; two patients were white and one was Asian .
After 120 weeks of exposure to MEPSEVII , one patient demonstrated a 21 % improvement over baseline in forced vital capacity ( FVC % predicted ) on pulmonary function testing in addition to a 105 meter improvement in the 6 MWT .
