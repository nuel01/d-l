However , the precise dose reduction in this patient population is not known , and subsequent dose modifications should be considered based on individual patient tolerance to treatment ( see Tables 3 - 4 ) .
2 . 4 Premedication It is recommended that patients receive premedication with antiemetic agents .
In clinical studies of the weekly dosage schedule , the majority of patients received 10 mg of dexamethasone given in conjunction with another type of antiemetic agent , such as a 5 - HT3 blocker ( e . g . , ondansetron or granisetron ) .
Antiemetic agents should be given on the day of treatment , starting at least 30 minutes before administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection .
Physicians should also consider providing patients with an antiemetic regimen ( e . g . , prochlorperazine ) for subsequent use as needed .
Prophylactic or therapeutic administration of atropine should be considered in patients experiencing cholinergic symptoms .
2 . 5 Preparation of Infusion Solution Inspect vial contents for particulate matter and discoloration and repeat inspection when drug product is withdrawn from vial into syringe .
Irinotecan hydrochloride injection 20 mg / mL is intended for single use only and any unused portion should be discarded .
Irinotecan hydrochloride injection must be diluted prior to infusion .
Irinotecan hydrochloride injection should be diluted in 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP , ( preferred ) or 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP , to a final concentration range of 0 . 12 mg / mL to 2 . 8 mg / mL .
Other drugs should not be added to the infusion solution .
The solution is physically and chemically stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature and in ambient fluorescent lighting .
Solutions diluted in 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP , and stored at refrigerated temperatures ( approximately 2 ° to 8 ° C , 36 ° to 46 ° F ) , and protected from light are physically and chemically stable for 48 hours .
Refrigeration of admixtures using 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP , is not recommended due to a low and sporadic incidence of visible particulates .
Freezing irinotecan hydrochloride injection and admixtures of irinotecan hydrochloride injection may result in precipitation of the drug and should be avoided .
The irinotecan hydrochloride injection solution should be used immediately after reconstitution as it contains no antibacterial preservative .
Because of possible microbial contamination during dilution , it is advisable to use the admixture prepared with 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP , within 24 hours if refrigerated ( 2 ° to 8 ° C , 36 ° to 46 ° F ) .
In the case of admixtures prepared with 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP , or Sodium Chloride Injection , USP , the solutions should be used within 4 hours if kept at room temperature .
If reconstitution and dilution are performed under strict aseptic conditions ( e . g . , on Laminar Air Flow bench ) , irinotecan hydrochloride injection solution should be used ( infusion completed ) within 12 hours at room temperature or 24 hours if refrigerated ( 2 ° to 8 ° C , 36 ° to 46 ° F ) .
2 . 6 Safe Handling Care should be exercised in the handling and preparation of infusion solutions prepared from irinotecan hydrochloride injection .
The use of gloves is recommended .
If a solution of irinotecan hydrochloride injection contacts the skin , wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water .
If irinotecan hydrochloride injection contacts the mucous membranes , flush thoroughly with water .
Several published guidelines for handling and disposal of anticancer agents are available .
2 . 7 Extravasation Care should be taken to avoid extravasation , and the infusion site should be monitored for signs of inflammation .
Should extravasation occur , flushing the site with sterile water and applications of ice are recommended .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Irinotecan hydrochloride injection , USP is available in two single - dose sizes : • 2 mL - fill vial containing 40 mg irinotecan hydrochloride injection , USP • 5 mL - fill vial containing 100 mg irinotecan hydrochloride injection , USP Irinotecan hydrochloride injection , USP is available in two single - dose sizes : • 2 mL - fill vial containing 40 mg irinotecan hydrochloride • 5 mL - fill vial containing 100 mg irinotecan hydrochloride 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Hypersensitivity to Irinotecan hydrochloride injection or its excipients ( 4 ) • Irinotecan hydrochloride injection is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or its excipients .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Diarrhea and cholinergic reactions : Early diarrhea ( occurring during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan hydrochloride injection ) is usually transient and may be accompanied by cholinergic symptoms .
Consider prophylactic or therapeutic administration of 0 . 25 mg to 1 mg of intravenous or subcutaneous atropine ( unless clinically contraindicated ) .
Late diarrhea ( generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection ) can occur .
Monitor and replace fluid and electrolytes .
Treat with loperamide .
Use antibiotic support for ileus and fever .
Interrupt irinotecan hydrochloride injection and reduce subsequent doses if severe diarrhea occurs .
( 5 . 1 ) • Myelosuppression : Manage promptly with antibiotic support .
Interrupt irinotecan hydrochloride injection and reduce subsequent doses if necessary .
( 5 . 2 ) • Patients with Reduced UGT1A1 Activity : Individuals who are homozygous for the UGT1A1 * 28 allele are at increased risk for neutropenia following initiation of irinotecan hydrochloride injection treatment .
( 5 . 3 ) • Hypersensitivity : Hypersensitivity reactions including severe anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have been observed .
• Discontinue irinotecan hydrochloride injection if this occurs .
( 5 . 4 ) • Renal Impairment / Renal Failure : Rare cases of renal impairment and acute renal failure have been identified , usually in patients who became volume depleted from severe vomiting and / or diarrhea .
( 5 . 5 ) • Pulmonary Toxicity : Interstitial Pulmonary Disease ( IPD ) - like events , including fatalities , have occurred .
Interrupt for new or progressive dysnpnea , cough , and fever pending evaluation .
If IPD diagnosed , discontinue and institute appropriate treatment as needed .
( 5 . 6 ) • Toxicity of the 5 Day Regimen : Irinotecan hydrochloride injection should not be used in combination with a regimen of 5 - FU / LV administered for 4 - 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks outside of a clinical study .
( 5 . 7 ) • Embryofetal Toxicity : Irinotecan hydrochloride injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
( 5 . 9 ) • Patients with Hepatic Impairment : In clinical trials , irinotecan hydrochloride injection has not been administered to patients with serum bilirubin > 2 . 0 mg / dL , or transaminases > 3 times ULN if no liver metastases , or transaminases > 5 times ULN if liver metastases .
With the weekly dosage schedule , patients with total bilirubin levels 1 . 0 - 2 . 0 mg / dL had greater likelihood of grade 3 - 4 neutropenia .
( 5 . 10 ) 5 . 1 Diarrhea and Cholinergic Reactions Early diarrhea ( occurring during or shortly after infusion of Irinotecan hydrochloride ) is usually transient and infrequently severe .
It may be accompanied by cholinergic symptoms of rhinitis , increased salivation , miosis , lacrimation , diaphoresis , flushing , and intestinal hyperperistalsis that can cause abdominal cramping .
Bradycardia may also occur .
Early diarrhea and other cholinergic symptoms may be prevented or treated .
Consider prophylactic or therapeutic administration of 0 . 25 mg to 1 mg of intravenous or subcutaneous atropine ( unless clinically contraindicated ) .
These symptoms are expected to occur more frequently with higher irinotecan doses .
Late diarrhea ( generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of irinotecan hydrochloride ) can be life threatening since it may be prolonged and may lead to dehydration , electrolyte imbalance , or sepsis .
Grade 3 - 4 late diarrhea occurred in 23 - 31 % of patients receiving weekly dosing .
In the clinical studies , the median time to the onset of late diarrhea was 5 days with 3 - week dosing and 11 days with weekly dosing .
Late diarrhea can be complicated by colitis , ulceration , bleeding , ileus , obstruction , and infection .
Cases of megacolon and intestinal perforation have been reported .
Patients should have loperamide readily available to begin treatment for late diarrhea .
Begin loperamide at the first episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements more frequent than normal .
One dosage regimen for loperamide is 4 mg at the first onset of late diarrhea and then 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea - free for at least 12 hours .
Loperamide is not recommended to be used for more than 48 consecutive hours at these doses , because of the risk of paralytic ileus .
During the night , the patient may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours .
Monitor and replace fluid and electrolytes .
Use antibiotic support for ileus , fever , or severe neutropenia .
Subsequent weekly chemotherapy treatments should be delayed in patients until return of pretreatment bowel function for at least 24 hours without anti - diarrhea medication .
Patients must not be treated with Irinotecan hydrochloride until resolution of the bowel obstruction .
If grade 2 , 3 , or 4 late diarrhea recurs , subsequent doses of Irinotecan hydrochloride should be decreased [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Avoid diuretics or laxatives in patients with diarrhea .
5 . 2 Myelosuppression Deaths due to sepsis following severe neutropenia have been reported in patients treated with Irinotecan hydrochloride .
In the clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule , neutropenic fever ( concurrent NCI grade 4 neutropenia and fever of grade 2 or greater ) occurred in 3 % of the patients ; 6 % of patients received G - CSF for the treatment of neutropenia .
Manage febrile neutropenia promptly with antibiotic support [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Hold Irinotecan hydrochloride if neutropenic fever occurs or if the absolute neutrophil count drops < 1000 / mm3 .
After recovery to an absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000 / mm3 , subsequent doses of irinotecan hydrochloride should be reduced [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
When evaluated in the trials of weekly administration , the frequency of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was higher in patients who received previous pelvic / abdominal irradiation than in those who had not received such irradiation ( 48 % [ 13 / 27 ] versus 24 % [ 67 / 277 ] ; p = 0 . 04 ) .
Patients who have previously received pelvic / abdominal irradiation are at increased risk of severe myelosuppression following the administration of Irinotecan hydrochloride .
Based on sparse available data , the concurrent administration of Irinotecan hydrochloride with irradiation is not recommended .
Patients with baseline serum total bilirubin levels of 1 . 0 mg / dL or more also had a greater likelihood of experiencing first - cycle grade 3 or 4 neutropenia than those with bilirubin levels that were less than 1 . 0 mg / dL ( 50 % [ 19 / 38 ] versus 18 % [ 47 / 266 ] ; p < 0 . 001 ) .
Patients with deficient glucuronidation of bilirubin , such as those with Gilbert ' s syndrome , may be at greater risk of myelosuppression when receiving therapy with Irinotecan hydrochloride .
5 . 3 Patients With Reduced UGT1A1 Activity Individuals who are homozygous for the UGT1A1 * 28 allele ( UGT1A1 7 / 7 genotype ) are at increased risk for neutropenia following initiation of Irinotecan hydrochloride treatment .
In a study of 66 patients who received single - agent Irinotecan hydrochloride ( 350 mg / m2 once - every - 3 - weeks ) , the incidence of grade 4 neutropenia in patients homozygous for the UGT1A1 * 28 allele was 50 % , and in patients heterozygous for this allele ( UGT1A1 6 / 7 genotype ) the incidence was 12 . 5 % .
No grade 4 neutropenia was observed in patients homozygous for the wild - type allele ( UGT1A1 6 / 6 genotype ) .
When administered as a single - agent , a reduction in the starting dose by at least one level of Irinotecan hydrochloride should be considered for patients known to be homozygous for the UGT1A1 * 28 allele .
However , the precise dose reduction in this patient population is not known and subsequent dose modifications should be considered based on individual patient tolerance to treatment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
UGT1A1 Testing A laboratory test is available to determine the UGT1A1 status of patients .
Testing can detect the UGT1A1 6 / 6 , 6 / 7 and 7 / 7 genotypes .
5 . 4 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions including severe anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have been observed .
Discontinue Irinotecan hydrochloride if anaphylactic reaction occurs .
5 . 5 Renal Impairment / Renal Failure Renal impairment and acute renal failure have been identified , usually in patients who became volume depleted from severe vomiting and / or diarrhea .
5 . 6 Pulmonary Toxicity Interstitial Pulmonary Disease ( IPD ) - like events , including fatalities , have occurred in patients receiving irinotecan ( in combination and as monotherapy ) .
Risk factors include pre - existing lung disease , use of pneumotoxic drugs , radiation therapy , and colony stimulating factors .
Patients with risk factors should be closely monitored for respiratory symptoms before and during Irinotecan hydrochloride therapy .
In Japanese studies , a reticulonodular pattern on chest x - ray was observed in a small percentage of patients .
New or progressive , dyspnea , cough , and fever should prompt interruption of chemotherapy , pending diagnostic evaluation .
If IPD is diagnosed , Irinotecan hydrochloride and other chemotherapy should be discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted as needed [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 7 Toxicity of the 5 Day Regimen Outside of a well - designed clinical study , irinotecan hydrochloride injection should not be used in combination with a regimen of 5 - FU / LV administered for 4 - 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks because of reports of increased toxicity , including toxic deaths .
Irinotecan hydrochloride should be used as recommended in Table 2 [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
5 . 8 Increased Toxicity in Patients with Performance Status 2 In the clinical trials , higher rates of hospitalization , neutropenic fever , thromboembolism , first - cycle treatment discontinuation , and early deaths were observed in patients with a baseline performance status of 2 than in patients with a baseline performance status of 0 or 1 .
5 . 9 Embryofetal Toxicity Irinotecan hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Irinotecan was embryotoxic in rats and rabbits at doses significantly lower than those administered to humans on a mg / m2 basis .
In rats , at exposures approximately 0 . 2 times those achieved in humans at the 125 mg / m2 dose , irinotecan was embryotoxic and resulted in decreased learning ability and female fetal body weight in surviving pups ; the drug was teratogenic at lower exposures ( approximately 0 . 025 times the AUC in humans at the 125 mg / m2 dose ) .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of irinotecan in pregnant women .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus .
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with Irinotecan hydrochloride .
5 . 10 Patients with Hepatic Impairment The use of Irinotecan hydrochloride in patients with significant hepatic impairment has not been established .
In clinical trials of either dosing schedule , irinotecan was not administered to patients with serum bilirubin > 2 . 0 mg / dL , or transaminase > 3 times the upper limit of normal if no liver metastasis , or transaminase > 5 times the upper limit of normal with liver metastasis .
In clinical trials of the weekly dosage schedule , patients with modestly elevated baseline serum total bilirubin levels ( 1 . 0 to 2 . 0 mg / dL ) had a significantly greater likelihood of experiencing first - cycle , grade 3 or 4 neutropenia than those with bilirubin levels that were less than 1 . 0 mg / dL ( 50 % [ 19 / 38 ] versus 18 % [ 47 / 226 ] ; p < 0 . 001 ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Common adverse reactions ( > 30 % ) observed in single agent therapy clinical studies are : nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , diarrhea , constipation , anorexia , neutropenia , leukopenia ( including lymphocytopenia ) , anemia , asthenia , fever , body weight decreasing , alopecia .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact 1 - 888 - 557 - 1212 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
Common adverse reactions ( > 30 % ) observed in single agent therapy clinical studies are : nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , diarrhea , constipation , anorexia , neutropenia , leukopenia ( including lymphocytopenia ) , anemia , asthenia , fever , body weight decreasing , and alopecia .
Serious opportunistic infections have not been observed , and no complications have specifically been attributed to lymphocytopenia .
Second - Line Single - Agent Therapy Weekly Dosage Schedule In three clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule , 304 patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum that had recurred or progressed following 5 - FU - based therapy were treated with Irinotecan hydrochloride .
Seventeen of the patients died within 30 days of the administration of Irinotecan hydrochloride ; in five cases ( 1 . 6 % , 5 / 304 ) , the deaths were potentially drug - related .
One of the patients died of neutropenic sepsis without fever .
Neutropenic fever occurred in nine ( 3 . 0 % ) other patients ; these patients recovered with supportive care .
One hundred nineteen ( 39 . 1 % ) of the 304 patients were hospitalized because of adverse events ; 81 ( 26 . 6 % ) patients were hospitalized for events judged to be related to administration of Irinotecan hydrochloride .
The primary reasons for drug - related hospitalization were diarrhea , with or without nausea and / or vomiting ( 18 . 4 % ) ; neutropenia / leukopenia , with or without diarrhea and / or fever ( 8 . 2 % ) ; and nausea and / or vomiting ( 4 . 9 % ) .
The first dose of at least one cycle of Irinotecan hydrochloride was reduced for 67 % of patients who began the studies at the 125 - mg / m2 starting dose .
Within - cycle dose reductions were required for 32 % of the cycles initiated at the 125 - mg / m2 dose level .
The most common reasons for dose reduction were late diarrhea , neutropenia , and leukopenia .
Thirteen ( 4 . 3 % ) patients discontinued treatment with Irinotecan hydrochloride because of adverse events .
The adverse events in Table 7 are based on the experience of the 304 patients enrolled in the three studies described in Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) .

Eleven ( 3 . 5 % ) patients treated with irinotecan died within 30 days of treatment .
In three cases ( 1 % , 3 / 316 ) , the deaths were potentially related to irinotecan treatment and were attributed to neutropenic infection , grade 4 diarrhea , and asthenia , respectively .
One ( 0 . 8 % , 1 / 129 ) patient treated with 5 - FU died within 30 days of treatment ; this death was attributed to grade 4 diarrhea .
Hospitalizations due to serious adverse events occurred at least once in 60 % ( 188 / 316 ) of patients who received irinotecan , 63 % ( 57 / 90 ) who received best supportive care , and 39 % ( 50 / 129 ) who received 5 - FU - based therapy .
Eight percent of patients treated with irinotecan and 7 % treated with 5 - FU - based therapy discontinued treatment due to adverse events .
Of the 316 patients treated with irinotecan , the most clinically significant adverse events ( all grades , 1 - 4 ) were diarrhea ( 84 % ) , alopecia ( 72 % ) , nausea ( 70 % ) , vomiting ( 62 % ) , cholinergic symptoms ( 47 % ) , and neutropenia ( 30 % ) .
Table 8 lists the grade 3 and 4 adverse events reported in the patients enrolled to all treatment arms of the two studies described in Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) .

The 8 . 5 % incidence of akathisia , however , is within the range reported for use of prochlorperazine when given as a premedication for other chemotherapies .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Irinotecan hydrochloride .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Myocardial ischemic events have been observed following Irinotecan hydrochloride therapy .
Thromboembolic events have been observed in patients receiving Irinotecan hydrochloride .
Symptomatic pancreatitis , asymptomatic pancreatic enzyme elevation have been reported .
Increases in serum levels of transaminases ( i . e . , AST and ALT ) in the absence of progressive liver metastasis have been observed .
Hyponatremia , mostly with diarrhea and vomiting , has been reported .
Transient dysarthria has been reported in patients treated with Irinotecan hydrochloride ; in some cases , the event was attributed to the cholinergic syndrome observed during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan .
Interaction between Irinotecan hydrochloride and neuromuscular blocking agents cannot be ruled out .
Irinotecan has anticholinesterase activity , which may prolong the neuromuscular blocking effects of suxamethonium and the neuromuscular blockade of non - depolarizing drugs may be antagonized .

( 7 . 2 ) • Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors : Do not administer strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with Irinotecan hydrochloride .
( 7 . 3 ) 7 . 2 Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Exposure to irinotecan or its active metabolite SN - 38 is substantially reduced in adult and pediatric patients concomitantly receiving the CYP3A4 enzyme - inducing anticonvulsants phenytoin , phenobarbital , carbamazepine , or St . John ' s wort .
The appropriate starting dose for patients taking these or other strong inducers such as rifampin and rifabutin has not been defined .
Consider substituting non - enzyme inducing therapies at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of irinotecan hydrochloride injection therapy .
Do not administer strong CYP3A4 inducers with irinotecan hydrochloride injection unless there are no therapeutic alternatives .
7 . 3 Strong CYP3A4 or UGT1A1 Inhibitors Irinotecan and its active metabolite , SN - 38 , are metabolized via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme ( CYP3A4 ) and uridine diphosphate - glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 ( UGT1A1 ) , respectively , [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Patients receiving concomitant ketoconazole , a CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 inhibitor , have increased exposure to irinotecan and its active metabolite SN - 38 .
Coadministration of irinotecan hydrochloride with other inhibitors of CYP3A4 ( e . g . , clarithromycin , indinavir , itraconazole , lopinavir , nefazodone , nelfinavir , ritonavir , saquinavir , telaprevir , voriconazole ) or UGT1A1 ( e . g . , atazanavir , gemfibrozil , indinavir ) may increase systemic exposure to irinotecan or SN - 38 .
Discontinue strong CYP3A4 inhibitors at least 1 week prior to starting irinotecan hydrochloride injection therapy .
Do not administer strong CYP3A4 or UGT1A1 inhibitors with irinotecan hydrochloride injection unless there are no therapeutic alternatives .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Nursing Mothers : Discontinue nursing when receiving therapy with irinotecan hydrochloride injection .
( 8 . 3 ) • Geriatric Use : Closely monitor patients greater than 65 years of age because of a greater risk of early and late diarrhea in this population .
( 8 . 5 ) • Patients with Renal Impairment : Use caution and do not use in patients on dialysis .
( 8 . 6 ) • Patients with Hepatic Impairment : Use caution .
( 2 , 5 . 10 , 8 . 7 , 12 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] Irinotecan hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Radioactivity related to 14 C - irinotecan crosses the placenta of rats following intravenous administration of 10 mg / kg ( which in separate studies produced an irinotecan Cmax and AUC about 3 and 0 . 5 times , respectively , the corresponding values in patients administered 125 mg / m2 ) .
Intravenous administration of irinotecan 6 mg / kg / day to rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased post - implantation loss and decreased numbers of live fetuses .
In separate studies in rats , this dose produced an Irinotecan Cmax and AUC of about 2 and 0 . 2 times , respectively , the corresponding values in patients administered 125 mg / m2 .
In rabbits , the embryotoxic dose was about one - half the recommended human weekly starting dose on a mg / m2basis .
Irinotecan was teratogenic in rats at doses greater than 1 . 2 mg / kg / day and in rabbits at 6 . 0 mg / kg / day .
In separate studies in rats , this dose produced an irinotecan Cmax and AUC about 2 / 3 and 1 / 40 th , respectively , of the corresponding values in patients administered 125 mg / m2 .
In rabbits , the teratogenic dose was about one - half the recommended human weekly starting dose on a mg / m2basis .
Teratogenic effects included a variety of external , visceral , and skeletal abnormalities .
Irinotecan administered to rat dams for the period following organogenesis through weaning at doses of 6 mg / kg / day caused decreased learning ability and decreased female body weights in the offspring .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of irinotecan in pregnant women .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus .
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with irinotecan hydrochloride injection .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Radioactivity appeared in rat milk within 5 minutes of intravenous administration of radiolabeled irinotecan and was concentrated up to 65 - fold at 4 hours after administration relative to plasma concentrations .
It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from irinotecan hydrochloride , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The effectiveness of irinotecan in pediatric patients has not been established .
Results from two open - label , single arm studies were evaluated .
One hundred and seventy children with refractory solid tumors were enrolled in one phase 2 trial in which 50 mg / m2 of irinotecan was infused for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks .
Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia was experienced by 54 ( 31 . 8 % ) patients . Neutropenia was complicated by fever in 15 ( 8 . 8 % ) patients .
Grade 3 - 4 diarrhea was observed in 35 ( 20 . 6 % ) patients .
This adverse event profile was comparable to that observed in adults .
In the second phase 2 trial of 21 children with previously untreated rhabdomyosarcoma , 20 mg / m2of irinotecan was infused for 5 consecutive days on weeks 0 , 1 , 3 and 4 .
This single agent therapy was followed by multimodal therapy .
Accrual to the single agent irinotecan phase was halted due to the high rate ( 28 . 6 % ) of progressive disease and the early deaths ( 14 % ) .
The adverse event profile was different in this study from that observed in adults ; the most significant grade 3 or 4 adverse events were dehydration experienced by 6 patients ( 28 . 6 % ) associated with severe hypokalemia in 5 patients ( 23 . 8 % ) and hyponatremia in 3 patients ( 14 . 3 % ) ; in addition Grade 3 - 4 infection was reported in 5 patients ( 23 . 8 % ) ( across all courses of therapy and irrespective of causal relationship ) .
Pharmacokinetic parameters for irinotecan and SN - 38 were determined in 2 pediatric solid - tumor trials at dose levels of 50 mg / m2 ( 60 - min infusion , n = 48 ) and 125 mg / m2 ( 90 - min infusion , n = 6 ) .
Irinotecan clearance ( mean + S . D . ) was 17 . 3 + 6 . 7 L / h / m2 for the 50 mg / m2 dose and 16 . 2 + 4 . 6 L / h / m2 for the 125 mg / m2 dose , which is comparable to that in adults .
Dose - normalized SN - 38 AUC values were comparable between adults and children .
Minimal accumulation of irinotecan and SN - 38 was observed in children on daily dosing regimens [ daily x 5 every 3 weeks or ( daily x 5 ) x 2 weeks every 3 weeks ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Patients greater than 65 years of age should be closely monitored because of a greater risk of early and late diarrhea in this population [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The starting dose of irinotecan hydrochloride in patients 70 years and older for the once - every - 3 - week - dosage schedule should be 300 mg / m2 [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
The frequency of grade 3 and 4 late diarrhea by age was significantly greater in patients ≥ 65 years than in patients < 65 years ( 40 % [ 53 / 133 ] versus 23 % [ 40 / 171 ] ; p = 0 . 002 ) .
In another study of 183 patients treated on the weekly schedule , the frequency of grade 3 or 4 late diarrhea in patients > 65 years of age was 28 . 6 % [ 26 / 91 ] and in patients < 65 years of age was 23 . 9 % [ 22 / 92 ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment The influence of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan has not been evaluated .
Therefore , use caution in patients with impaired renal function .
Irinotecan hydrochloride injection is not recommended for use in patients on dialysis .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Irinotecan clearance is diminished in patients with hepatic impairment while exposure to the active metabolite SN - 38 is increased relative to that in patients with normal hepatic function .
The magnitude of these effects is proportional to the degree of liver impairment as measured by elevations in total bilirubin and transaminase concentrations .
Therefore , use caution when administering irinotecan hydrochloride patients with hepatic impairment .
The tolerability of irinotecan in patients with hepatic dysfunction ( bilirubin greater than 2 mg / dl ) has not been assessed sufficiently , and no recommendations for dosing can be made [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE In U . S . phase 1 trials , single doses of up to 345 mg / m2 of irinotecan were administered to patients with various cancers .
Single doses of up to 750 mg / m2 of irinotecan have been given in non - U . S . trials .
The adverse events in these patients were similar to those reported with the recommended dosage and regimen .
There have been reports of overdosage at doses up to approximately twice the recommended therapeutic dose , which may be fatal .
The most significant adverse reactions reported were severe neutropenia and severe diarrhea .
There is no known antidote for overdosage of irinotecan hydrochloride .
Maximum supportive care should be instituted to prevent dehydration due to diarrhea and to treat any infectious complications .
11 DESCRIPTION Irinotecan hydrochloride injection , USP is an antineoplastic agent of the topoisomerase I inhibitor class .
Irinotecan hydrochloride injection , USP is supplied as a sterile , pale yellow , clear , aqueous solution .
Each milliliter of solution contains 20 mg of irinotecan hydrochloride ( on the basis of the trihydrate salt ) , 45 mg of sorbitol , NF , and 0 . 9 mg of lactic acid , USP .
The pH of the solution has been adjusted to 3 . 5 ( range , 3 . 0 to 3 . 8 ) with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid .
Irinotecan hydrochloride injection , USP is intended for dilution with 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP ( D5W ) , or 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP , prior to intravenous infusion .
The preferred diluent is 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP .
Irinotecan hydrochloride is a semisynthetic derivative of camptothecin , an alkaloid extract from plants such as Camptotheca acuminata or is chemically synthesized .
The chemical name is [ 1 , 4 ′ - bipiperidine ] - 1 ′ - carboxylic acid ( 4 S ) - 4 , 11 - diethyl - 3 , 4 , 12 , 14 - tetrahydro - 4 - hydroxy - 3 , 14 - dioxo1H - pyrano [ 3 ' , 4 ' : 6 , 7 ] - indolizino [ 1 , 2 - b ] quinolin - 9 - yl ester hydrochloride trihydrate .
Its empirical formula is C33H38N4O6HCl . 3H2O and molecular weight is 677 . 18 .
It is slightly soluble in water and organic solvents .
Its structural formula is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Irinotecan is a derivative of camptothecin .
Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I , which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single - strand breaks .
Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN - 38 bind to the topoisomerase I - DNA complex and prevent religation of these single - strand breaks .
Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double - strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I , DNA , and either irinotecan or SN - 38 .
Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double - strand breaks .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Irinotecan serves as a water - soluble precursor of the lipophilic metabolite SN - 38 .
SN - 38 is formed from irinotecan by carboxylesterase - mediated cleavage of the carbamate bond between the camptothecin moiety and the dipiperidino side chain .
SN - 38 is approximately 1000 times as potent as irinotecan as an inhibitor of topoisomerase I purified from human and rodent tumor cell lines .
In vitro cytotoxicity assays show that the potency of SN - 38 relative to irinotecan varies from 2 - to 2000 - fold ; however , the plasma area under the concentration versus time curve ( AUC ) values for SN - 38 are 2 % to 8 % of irinotecan and SN - 38 is 95 % bound to plasma proteins compared to approximately 50 % bound to plasma proteins for irinotecan [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The precise contribution of SN - 38 to the activity of irinotecan hydrochloride is thus unknown .
Both irinotecan and SN - 38 exist in an active lactone form and an inactive hydroxy acid anion form .
A pH - dependent equilibrium exists between the two forms such that an acid pH promotes the formation of the lactone , while a more basic pH favors the hydroxy acid anion form .
Administration of irinotecan has resulted in antitumor activity in mice bearing cancers of rodent origin and in human carcinoma xenografts of various histological types .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous infusion of irinotecan in humans , irinotecan plasma concentrations decline in a multiexponential manner , with a mean terminal elimination half - life of about 6 to 12 hours .
The mean terminal elimination half - life of the active metabolite SN - 38 is about 10 to 20 hours .
The half - lives of the lactone ( active ) forms of irinotecan and SN - 38 are similar to those of total irinotecan and SN - 38 , as the lactone and hydroxy acid forms are in equilibrium .
Over the recommended dose range of 50 to 350 mg / m2 , the AUC of irinotecan increases linearly with dose ; the AUC of SN - 38 increases less than proportionally with dose .
Maximum concentrations of the active metabolite SN - 38 are generally seen within 1 hour following the end of a 90 - minute infusion of irinotecan .
Pharmacokinetic parameters for Irinotecan and SN - 38 following a 90 - minute infusion of irinotecan at dose levels of 125 and 340 mg / m2 determined in two clinical studies in patients with solid tumors are summarized in Table 9 : Table 9 : Summary of Mean ( ± Standard Deviation ) Irinotecan and SN - 38 Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Patients with Solid TumorsCmax - Maximum plasma concentration AUC0 - 24 - Area under the plasma concentration - time curve from time 0 to 24 hours after the end of the 90 - minute infusion t1 / 2 - Terminal elimination half - life Vz - Volume of distribution of terminal elimination phase CL - Total systemic clearance a Plasma specimens collected for 24 hours following the end of the 90 - minute infusion .
b Plasma specimens collected for 48 hours following the end of the 90 - minute infusion .
Because of the longer collection period , these values provide a more accurate reflection of the terminal elimination half - lives of irinotecan and SN - 38 .

SN - 38 is highly bound to human plasma proteins ( approximately 95 % bound ) .
The plasma protein to which irinotecan and SN - 38 predominantly binds is albumin .
Metabolism Irinotecan is subject to extensive metabolic conversion by various enzyme systems , including esterases to form the active metabolite SN - 38 , and UGT1A1 mediating glucuronidation of SN - 38 to form the inactive glucuronide metabolite SN - 38 G .
Irinotecan can also undergo CYP3A4 - mediated oxidative metabolism to several inactive oxidation products , one of which can be hydrolyzed by carboxylesterase to release SN - 38 .
In vitro studies indicate that irinotecan , SN - 38 and another metabolite aminopentane carboxylic acid ( APC ) , do not inhibit cytochrome P - 450 isozymes .
UGT1A1 activity is reduced in individuals with genetic polymorphisms that lead to reduced enzyme activity such as the UGT1A1 * 28 polymorphism .
Approximately 10 % of the North American population is homozygous for the UGT1A1 * 28 allele ( also referred to as UGT1A1 7 / 7 genotype ) .
In a prospective study , in which irinotecan was administered as a single - agent ( 350 mg / m2 ) on a once - every - 3 - week schedule , patients with the UGT1A1 7 / 7 genotype had a higher exposure to SN - 38 than patients with the wild - type UGT1A1 allele ( UGT1A1 6 / 6 genotype ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
SN - 38 glucuronide had 1 / 50 to 1 / 100 the activity of SN - 38 in cytotoxicity assays using two cell lines in vitro .
Excretion The disposition of irinotecan has not been fully elucidated in humans .
The urinary excretion of irinotecan is 11 % to 20 % ; SN - 38 , < 1 % ; and SN - 38 glucuronide , 3 % .
The cumulative biliary and urinary excretion of irinotecan and its metabolites ( SN - 38 and SN - 38 glucuronide ) over a period of 48 hours following administration of irinotecan in two patients ranged from approximately 25 % ( 100 mg / m2 ) to 50 % ( 300 mg / m2 ) .
Effect of Age The pharmacokinetics of irinotecan administered using the weekly schedule was evaluated in a study of 183 patients that was prospectively designed to investigate the effect of age on irinotecan toxicity .
Results from this trial indicate that there are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan , SN - 38 , and SN - 38 glucuronide in patients < 65 years of age compared with patients ≥ 65 years of age .
In a study of 162 patients that was not prospectively designed to investigate the effect of age , small ( less than 18 % ) but statistically significant differences in dose - normalized irinotecan pharmacokinetic parameters in patients < 65 years of age compared to patients ≥ 65 years of age were observed .
Although dose - normalized AUC0 - 24 for SN - 38 in patients ≥ 65 years of age was 11 % higher than in patients < 65 years of age , this difference was not statistically significant .
No change in the starting dose is recommended for geriatric patients receiving the weekly dosage schedule of irinotecan [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Effect of Gender The pharmacokinetics of irinotecan do not appear to be influenced by gender .
Effect of Race The influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan has not been evaluated .
Effect of Hepatic Impairment Irinotecan clearance is diminished in patients with hepatic impairment while exposure to the active metabolite SN - 38 is increased relative to that in patients with normal hepatic function .
The magnitude of these effects is proportional to the degree of liver impairment as measured by elevations in total bilirubin and transaminase concentrations .
However , the tolerability of irinotecan in patients with hepatic dysfunction ( bilirubin greater than 2 mg / dl ) has not been assessed sufficiently , and no recommendations for dosing can be made [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Effect of Renal Impairment The influence of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan has not been evaluated .
Therefore , caution should be undertaken in patients with impaired renal function .
Irinotecan hydrochloride is not recommended for use in patients on dialysis [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Drug Interactions Dexamethasone , a moderate CYP3A4 inducer , does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term carcinogenicity studies with irinotecan were not conducted .
Rats were , however , administered intravenous doses of 2 mg / kg or 25 mg / kg irinotecan once per week for 13 weeks ( in separate studies , the 25 mg / kg dose produced an irinotecan Cmax and AUC that were about 7 . 0 times and 1 . 3 times the respective values in patients administered 125 mg / m2 weekly ) and were then allowed to recover for 91 weeks .
Under these conditions , there was a significant linear trend with dose for the incidence of combined uterine horn endometrial stromal polyps and endometrial stromal sarcomas .
Irinotecan was clastogenic both in vitro ( chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells ) and in vivo ( micronucleus test in mice ) .
Neither irinotecan nor its active metabolite SN - 38 was mutagenic in the in vitro Ames assay .
No significant adverse effects on fertility and general reproductive performance were observed after intravenous administration of irinotecan in doses of up to 6 mg / kg / day to rats and rabbits ; however , atrophy of male reproductive organs was observed after multiple daily irinotecan doses both in rodents at 20 mg / kg and in dogs at 0 . 4 mg / kg .
In separate studies in rodents , this dose produced an irinotecan Cmax and AUC about 5 and 1 times , respectively , of the corresponding values in patients administered 125 mg / m2 weekly .
In dogs this dose produced an irinotecan Cmax and AUC about one - half and 1 / 15 th , respectively , of the corresponding values in patients administered 125 mg / m2 weekly .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Irinotecan has been studied in clinical trials as a single agent [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Weekly and once - every - 3 - week dosage schedules were used for the single - agent irinotecan studies .
Clinical studies single - agent use are described below .
14 . 1 Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Second - Line Therapy After 5 - FU - Based Treatment 4 Weekly Doses on a 6 - Week Cycle : Studies 3 , 4 , and 5 Data from three open - label , single - agent , clinical studies , involving a total of 304 patients in 59 centers , support the use of irinotecan hydrochloride in the treatment of patients with metastatic cancer of the colon or rectum that has recurred or progressed following treatment with 5 - FU - based therapy .
These studies were designed to evaluate tumor response rate and do not provide information on effects on survival and disease - related symptoms .
In each study , irinotecan hydrochloride was administered in repeated 6 - week cycles consisting of a 90 - minute intravenous infusion once weekly for 4 weeks , followed by a 2 - week rest period .
Starting doses of irinotecan hydrochloride in these trials were 100 , 125 , or 150 mg / m2 , but the 150 - mg / m2 dose was poorly tolerated ( due to high rates of grade 4 late diarrhea and febrile neutropenia ) .
Study 3 enrolled 48 patients and was conducted by a single investigator at several regional hospitals .
Study 4 was a multicenter study conducted by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group .
All 90 patients enrolled in Study 4 received a starting dose of 125 mg / m2 .
Study 5 was a multicenter study that enrolled 166 patients from 30 institutions .
The initial dose in Study 5 was 125 mg / m2 but was reduced to 100 mg / m2 because the toxicity seen at the 125 - mg / m2 dose was perceived to be greater than that seen in previous studies .
All patients in these studies had metastatic colorectal cancer , and the majority had disease that recurred or progressed following a 5 - FU - based regimen administered for metastatic disease .
The results of the individual studies are shown in Table 11 .

Among these 193 patients , 2 complete and 27 partial responses were observed , for an overall response rate of 15 . 0 % ( 95 % Confidence Interval [ CI ] , 10 . 0 % to 20 . 1 % ) at this starting dose .
A considerably lower response rate was seen with a starting dose of 100 mg / m2 .
The majority of responses were observed within the first two cycles of therapy , but responses did occur in later cycles of treatment ( one response was observed after the eighth cycle ) .
The median response duration for patients beginning therapy at 125 mg / m2 was 5 . 8 months ( range , 2 . 6 to 15 . 1 months ) .
Of the 304 patients treated in the three studies , response rates to irinotecan hydrochloride were similar in males and females and among patients older and younger than 65 years .
Rates were also similar in patients with cancer of the colon or cancer of the rectum and in patients with single and multiple metastatic sites .
The response rate was 18 . 5 % in patients with a performance status of 0 and 8 . 2 % in patients with a performance status of 1 or 2 .
Patients with a performance status of 3 or 4 have not been studied .
Over half of the patients responding to irinotecan hydrochloride had not responded to prior 5 - FU .
Patients who had received previous irradiation to the pelvis responded to irinotecan hydrochloride at approximately the same rate as those who had not previously received irradiation .
Once - Every - 3 - Week Dosage Schedule Single Arm Study : Study 6 Data from an open - label , single - agent , single - arm , multicenter , clinical study involving a total of 132 patients support a once every - 3 - week dosage schedule of irinotecan in the treatment of patients with metastatic cancer of the colon or rectum that recurred or progressed following treatment with 5 - FU .
Patients received a starting dose of 350 mg / m2 given by 30 - minute intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks .
Among the 132 previously treated patients in this trial , the intent - to - treat response rate was 12 . 1 % ( 95 % CI , 7 . 0 % to 18 . 1 % ) .
Randomized Studies : Studies 7 and 8 Two multicenter , randomized , clinical studies further support the use of irinotecan given by the once - every - 3 - week dosage schedule in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer whose disease has recurred or progressed following prior 5 - FU therapy .
In Study 7 , second - line irinotecan therapy plus best supportive care was compared with best supportive care alone .
In Study 8 , second - line irinotecan therapy was compared with infusional 5 - FU - based therapy .
In both studies , irinotecan was administered intravenously at a starting dose of 350 mg / m2 over 90 minutes once every 3 weeks .
The starting dose was 300 mg / m2 for patients who were 70 years and older or who had a performance status of 2 .
The highest total dose permitted was 700 mg .
Dose reductions and / or administration delays were permitted in the event of severe hematologic and / or nonhematologic toxicities while on treatment .
Best supportive care was provided to patients in both arms of Study 7 and included antibiotics , analgesics , corticosteroids , transfusions , psychotherapy , or any other symptomatic therapy as clinically indicated .
In both studies , concomitant medications such as antiemetics , atropine , and loperamide were given to patients for prophylaxis and / or management of symptoms from treatment .
If late diarrhea persisted for greater than 24 hours despite loperamide , a 7 - day course of fluoroquinolone antibiotic prophylaxis was given .
Patients in the control arm of the Study 8 received one of the following 5 - FU regimens : ( 1 ) LV , 200 mg / m2 IV over 2 hours ; followed by 5 - FU , 400 mg / m2 IV bolus ; followed by 5 - FU , 600 mg / m2 continuous IV infusion over 22 hours on days 1 and 2 every 2 weeks ; ( 2 ) 5 - FU , 250 to 300 mg / m2 / day protracted continuous IV infusion until toxicity ; ( 3 ) 5 - FU , 2 . 6 to 3 g / m2 IV over 24 hours every week for 6 weeks with or without LV , 20 to 500 mg / m2 / day every week IV for 6 weeks with 2 - week rest between cycles .
Patients were to be followed every 3 to 6 weeks for 1 year .
A total of 535 patients were randomized in the two studies at 94 centers .
The primary endpoint in both studies was survival .
The studies demonstrated a significant overall survival advantage for irinotecan compared with best supportive care ( p = 0 . 0001 ) and infusional 5 - FU - based therapy ( p = 0 . 035 ) as shown in Figures 3 and 4 .
In Study 7 , median survival for patients treated with irinotecan was 9 . 2 months compared with 6 . 5 months for patients receiving best supportive care .
In Study 8 , median survival for patients treated with irinotecan was 10 . 8 months compared with 8 . 5 months for patients receiving infusional 5 - FU - based therapy .
Multiple regression analyses determined that patients ' baseline characteristics also had a significant effect on survival .
When adjusted for performance status and other baseline prognostic factors , survival among patients treated with irinotecan remained significantly longer than in the control populations ( p = 0 . 001 for Study 7 and p = 0 . 017 for Study 8 ) .
Measurements of pain , performance status , and weight loss were collected prospectively in the two studies ; however , the plan for the analysis of these data was defined retrospectively .
When comparing irinotecan with best supportive care in Study 7 , this analysis showed a statistically significant advantage for irinotecan , with longer time to development of pain ( 6 . 9 months versus 2 . 0 months ) , time to performance status deterioration ( 5 . 7 months versus 3 . 3 months ) , and time to > 5 % weight loss ( 6 . 4 months versus 4 . 2 months ) .
Additionally , 33 . 3 % ( 33 / 99 ) of patients with a baseline performance status of 1 or 2 showed an improvement in performance status when treated with irinotecan versus 11 . 3 % ( 7 / 62 ) of patients receiving best supportive care ( p = 0 . 002 ) .
Because of the inclusion of patients with non - measurable disease , intent - to - treat response rates could not be assessed .

At the start of each cycle of therapy , patients completed a questionnaire consisting of 30 questions , such as " Did pain interfere with daily activities ? "
( 1 = Not at All , to 4 = Very Much ) and " Do you have any trouble taking a long walk ? "
( Yes or No ) .
The answers from the 30 questions were converted into 15 subscales , that were scored from 0 to 100 , and the global health status subscale that was derived from two questions about the patient ' s sense of general well being in the past week .
The results as summarized in Table 13 are based on patients ' worst post - baseline scores .
In Study 7 , a multivariate analysis and univariate analyses of the individual subscales were performed and corrected for multivariate testing .
Patients receiving irinotecan reported significantly better results for the global health status , on two of five functional subscales , and on four of nine symptom subscales .
As expected , patients receiving irinotecan noted significantly more diarrhea than those receiving best supportive care .
In Study 8 , the multivariate analysis on all 15 subscales did not indicate a statistically significant difference between irinotecan and infusional 5 - FU .
Table 13 .
EORTC QLQ - C30 : Mean Worst Post - Baseline Scoreaa For the five functional subscales and global health status subscale , higher scores imply better functioning , whereas , on the nine symptom subscales , higher scores imply more severe symptoms .
The subscale scores of each patient were collected at each visit until the patient dropped out of the study .
