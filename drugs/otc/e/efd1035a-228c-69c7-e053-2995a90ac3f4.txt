6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
Adults and Adolescents Allergic Rhinitis : In multiple - dose placebo - controlled trials , 2 , 834 patients ages 12 years or older received Desloratadine Tablets at doses of 2 . 5 mg to 20 mg daily , of whom 1 , 655 patients received the recommended daily dose of 5 mg .
In patients receiving 5 mg daily , the rate of adverse events was similar between Desloratadine and placebo - treated patients .
The percent of patients who withdrew prematurely due to adverse events was 2 . 4 % in the Desloratadine group and 2 . 6 % in the placebo group .
There were no serious adverse events in these trials in patients receiving desloratadine .
All adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2 % of patients who received the recommended daily dose of Desloratadine Tablets ( 5 mg once daily ) , and that were more common with Desloratadine Tablets than placebo , are listed in Table 1 .
Table 1 Incidence of Adverse Events Reported by ≥ 2 % of Adult and Adolescent AllergicRhinitis Patients Receiving Desloratadine TabletsAdverse Event Desloratadine Tablets 5 mg ( n = 1 , 655 ) Placebo ( n = 1 , 652 ) Infections and Infestations Pharyngitis 4 . 1 % 2 . 0 % Nervous System Disorders Somnolence 2 . 1 % 1 . 8 % Gastrointestinal Disorders Dry Mouth 3 . 0 % 1 . 9 % Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders Myalgia 2 . 1 % 1 . 8 % Reproductive System and Breast Disorders Dysmenorrhea 2 . 1 % 1 . 6 % General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue 2 . 1 % 1 . 2 % The frequency and magnitude of laboratory and electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar in Desloratadine and placebo - treated patients .

Adverse events that were reported by greater than or equal to 2 % of patients who received Desloratadine Tablets and that were more common with Desloratadine than placebo were ( rates for Desloratadine and placebo , respectively ) : headache ( 14 % , 13 % ) , nausea ( 5 % , 2 % ) , fatigue ( 5 % , 1 % ) , dizziness ( 4 % , 3 % ) , pharyngitis ( 3 % , 2 % ) , dyspepsia ( 3 % , 1 % ) , and myalgia ( 3 % , 1 % ) .
Pediatrics Two hundred and forty - six pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age received Desloratadine Oral Solution for 15 days in three placebo controlled clinical trials .
Pediatric subjects aged 6 to 11 years received 2 . 5 mg once a day , subjects aged 1 to 5 years received 1 . 25 mg once a day , and subjects 6 to 11 months of age received 1 . 0 mg once a day .
In subjects 6 to 11 years of age , no individual adverse event was reported by 2 percent or more of the subjects .
In subjects 2 to 5 years of age , adverse events reported for Desloratadine and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever ( 5 . 5 % , 5 . 4 % ) , urinary tract infection ( 3 . 6 % , 0 % ) and varicella ( 3 . 6 % , 0 % ) .
In subjects 12 months to 23 months of age , adverse events reported for the Desloratadine product and placebo in at least 2 percent of subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution and at a frequency greater than placebo were fever ( 16 . 9 % , 12 . 9 % ) , diarrhea ( 15 . 4 % , 11 . 3 % ) , upper respiratory tract infections ( 10 . 8 % , 9 . 7 % ) , coughing ( 10 . 8 % , 6 . 5 % ) , appetite increased ( 3 . 1 % , 1 . 6 % ) , emotional lability ( 3 . 1 % , 0 % ) , epistaxis ( 3 . 1 % , 0 % ) , parasitic infection ( 3 . 1 % , 0 % ) , pharyngitis ( 3 . 1 % , 0 % ) , rash maculopapular ( 3 . 1 % , 0 % ) .

There were no clinically meaningful changes in any electrocardiographic parameter , including the QTc interval .
Only one of the 246 pediatric subjects receiving Desloratadine Oral Solution in the clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse event .
6 . 2 Post - Marketing Experience Because adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
The following spontaneous adverse events have been reported during the marketing of desloratadine : tachycardia , palpitations , rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions ( such as rash , pruritus , urticaria , edema , dyspnea , and anaphylaxis ) , psychomotor hyperactivity , seizures , and elevated liver enzymes including bilirubin , and very rarely , hepatitis .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4 In controlled clinical studies co - administration of desloratadine with ketoconazole , erythromycin , or azithromycin resulted in increased plasma concentrations of desloratadine and 3 hydroxydesloratadine , but there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine .
[ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) . ]
7 . 2 Fluoxetine In controlled clinical studies co - administration of desloratadine with fluoxetine , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , resulted in increased plasma concentrations of desloratadine and 3 hydroxydesloratadine , but there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine .
[ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) . ]
7 . 3 Cimetidine In controlled clinical studies co - administration of desloratadine with cimetidine , a histamine H2 - receptor antagonist , resulted in increased plasma concentrations of desloratadine and 3 hydroxydesloratadine , but there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine .
[ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) . ]
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Renal impairment : dosage adjustment is recommended ( 2 . 5 , 8 . 6 , 12 . 3 ) • Hepatic impairment : dosage adjustment is recommended ( 2 . 5 , 8 . 7 , 12 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C : There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , desloratadine should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Desloratadine was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits at approximately 210 and 230 times , respectively , the area under the concentration - time curve ( AUC ) in humans at the recommended daily oral dose .
An increase in pre - implantation loss and a decreased number of implantations and fetuses were noted , however , in a separate study in female rats at approximately 120 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose .
Reduced body weight and slow righting reflex were reported in pups at approximately 50 times or greater than the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose .
Desloratadine had no effect on pup development at approximately 7 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose .
The AUCs in comparison referred to the desloratadine exposure in rabbits and the sum of desloratadine and its metabolites exposures in rats , respectively .
[ See Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 2 ) . ]
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Desloratadine passes into breast milk ; therefore , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue desloratadine , taking into account the benefit of the drug to the nursing mother and the possible risk to the child .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The recommended dose of Desloratadine Oral Solution in the pediatric population is based on cross - study comparison of the plasma concentration of Desloratadine in adults and pediatric subjects .
The safety of Desloratadine Oral Solution has been established in 246 pediatric subjects aged 6 months to 11 years in three placebo - controlled clinical studies .
Since the course of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria and the effects of Desloratadine are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations , it allows extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients .
The effectiveness of Desloratadine Oral Solution in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies of Desloratadine Tablets in adults .
The safety and effectiveness of Desloratadine Tablets or Desloratadine Oral Solution have not been demonstrated in pediatric patients less than 6 months of age .
[ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) . ]
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of desloratadine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
[ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) . ]
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE There is no information to indicate that abuse or dependency occurs with Desloratadine Tablets .
10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of overdose , consider standard measures to remove any unabsorbed drug .
Symptomatic and supportive treatment is recommended .
Desloratadine and 3 - hydroxydesloratadine are not eliminated by hemodialysis .
Information regarding acute overdosage is limited to experience from post - marketing adverse event reports and from clinical trials conducted during the development of the Desloratadine product .
In a dose - ranging trial , at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg / day somnolence was reported .
In another study , no clinically relevant adverse events were reported in normal male and female volunteers who were given single daily doses of Desloratadine 45 mg for 10 days [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Lethality occurred in rats at oral doses of 250 mg / kg or greater ( estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 120 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose ) .
The oral median lethal dose in mice was 353 mg / kg ( estimated desloratadine exposures were approximately 290 times the human daily oral dose on a mg / m 2 basis ) .
No deaths occurred at oral doses up to 250 mg / kg in monkeys ( estimated desloratadine exposures were approximately 810 times the human daily oral dose on a mg / m 2 basis ) .
11 DESCRIPTION Desloratadine Tablets are light blue , round , tablets containing 5 mg desloratadine , an antihistamine , to be administered orally .
Desloratadine Tablets also contain the following inactive ingredients : microcrystalline cellulose NF , pregelatinized starch NF , croscarmellose sodium NF , talc USP , zinc stearate , USP and FD & C Blue # 2 HT 11 - 14 % .
Desloratadine is a white to off - white powder that is slightly soluble in water , but very soluble in ethanol and propylene glycol .
It has an empirical formula : C 19 H 19 ClN 2 and a molecular weight of 310 . 8 .
The chemical name is 8 - chloro - 6 , 11 - dihydro - 11 - ( 4 - piperdinylidene ) - 5 H - benzo [ 5 , 6 ] cyclohepta [ 1 , 2 - b ] pyridine and has the following structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Desloratadine is a long - acting tricyclic histamine antagonist with selective H1 - receptor histamine antagonist activity .
Receptor binding data indicates that at a concentration of 2 - 3 ng / mL ( 7 nanomolar ) , desloratadine shows significant interaction with the human histamine H1 - receptor .
Desloratadine inhibited histamine release from human mast cells in vitro .
Results of a radiolabeled tissue distribution study in rats and a radioligand H1 - receptor binding study in guinea pigs showed that desloratadine did not readily cross the blood brain barrier .
The clinical significance of this finding is unknown .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Wheal and Flare : Human histamine skin wheal studies following single and repeated 5 - mg doses of desloratadine have shown that the drug exhibits an antihistaminic effect by 1 hour ; this activity may persist for as long as 24 hours .
There was no evidence of histamine - induced skin wheal tachyphylaxis within the desloratadine 5 - mg group over the 28 - day treatment period .
The clinical relevance of histamine wheal skin testing is unknown .
Effects on QTc : Single daily doses of 45 mg were given to normal male and female volunteers for 10 days .
All ECGs obtained in this study were manually read in a blinded fashion by a cardiologist .
In Desloratadine - treated subjects , there was an increase in mean heart rate of 9 . 2 bpm relative to placebo .
The QT interval was corrected for heart rate ( QTc ) by both the Bazett and Fridericia methods .
Using the QTc ( Bazett ) there was a mean increase of 8 . 1 msec in Desloratadine - treated subjects relative to placebo .
Using QTc ( Fridericia ) there was a mean increase of 0 . 4 msec in Desloratadine treated subjects relative to placebo .
No clinically relevant adverse events were reported .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of a desloratadine 5 mg tablet once daily for 10 days to normal healthy volunteers , the mean time to maximum plasma concentrations ( T max ) occurred at approximately 3 hours post dose and mean steady state peak plasma concentrations ( C max ) and AUC of 4 ng / mL and 56 . 9 ng ⋅ hr / mL were observed , respectively .
Neither food nor grapefruit juice had an effect on the bioavailability ( C max and AUC ) of desloratadine .
The pharmacokinetic profile of Desloratadine Oral Solution was evaluated in a three - way crossover study in 30 adult volunteers .
A single dose of 10 mL of Desloratadine Oral Solution containing 5 mg of desloratadine was bioequivalent to a single dose of 5 mg Desloratadine Tablet .
Food had no effect on the bioavailability ( AUC and C max ) of Desloratadine Oral Solution .
Distribution Desloratadine and 3 - hydroxydesloratadine are approximately 82 % to 87 % and 85 % to 89 % bound to plasma proteins , respectively .
Protein binding of desloratadine and 3 - hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered in subjects with impaired renal function .
Metabolism Desloratadine ( a major metabolite of loratadine ) is extensively metabolized to 3 - hydroxydesloratadine , an active metabolite , which is subsequently glucuronidated .
The enzyme ( s ) responsible for the formation of 3 - hydroxydesloratadine have not been identified .
Data from clinical trials indicate that a subset of the general population has a decreased ability to form 3 - hydroxydesloratadine , and are poor metabolizers of desloratadine .
In pharmacokinetic studies ( n = 3 , 748 ) , approximately 6 % of subjects were poor metabolizers of desloratadine ( defined as a subject with an AUC ratio of 3 - hydroxydesloratadine to desloratadine less than 0 . 1 , or a subject with a desloratadine half - life exceeding 50 hours ) .
These pharmacokinetic studies included subjects between the ages of 2 and 70 years , including 977 subjects aged 2 to 5 years , 1 , 575 subjects aged 6 to 11 years , and 1196 subjects aged 12 to 70 years .
There was no difference in the prevalence of poor metabolizers across age groups .
The frequency of poor metabolizers was higher in Blacks ( 17 % , n = 988 ) as compared to Caucasians ( 2 % , n = 1 , 462 ) and Hispanics ( 2 % , n = 1 , 063 ) .
The median exposure ( AUC ) to desloratadine in the poor metabolizers was approximately 6 - fold greater than in the subjects who are not poor metabolizers .
Subjects who are poor metabolizers of desloratadine cannot be prospectively identified and will be exposed to higher levels of desloratadine following dosing with the recommended dose of desloratadine .
In multidose clinical safety studies , where metabolizer status was identified , a total of 94 poor metabolizers and 123 normal metabolizers were enrolled and treated with Desloratadine Oral Solution for 15 - 35 days .
In these studies , no overall differences in safety were observed between poor metabolizers and normal metabolizers .
Although not seen in these studies , an increased risk of exposure - related adverse events in patients who are poor metabolizers cannot be ruled out .
Elimination The mean plasma elimination half - life of desloratadine was approximately 27 hours .
C max and AUC values increased in a dose proportional manner following single oral doses between 5 and 20 mg .
The degree of accumulation after 14 days of dosing was consistent with the half - life and dosing frequency .
A human mass balance study documented a recovery of approximately 87 % of the 14 C - desloratadine dose , which was equally distributed in urine and feces as metabolic products .
Analysis of plasma 3 - hydroxydesloratadine showed similar T max and half - life values compared to desloratadine .
Special Populations Geriatric Subjects : In older subjects ( ≥ 65 years old ; n = 17 ) following multiple - dose administration of Desloratadine Tablets , the mean C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 20 % greater than in younger subjects ( < 65 years old ) .
The oral total body clearance ( CL / F ) when normalized for body weight was similar between the two age groups .
The mean plasma elimination half - life of desloratadine was 33 . 7 hr in subjects ≥ 65 years old .
The pharmacokinetics for 3 - hydroxydesloratadine appeared unchanged in older versus younger subjects .
These age - related differences are unlikely to be clinically relevant and no dosage adjustment is recommended in elderly subjects .
Pediatric Subjects : In subjects 6 to 11 years old , a single dose of 5 mL of Desloratadine Oral solution containing 2 . 5 mg of desloratadine , resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg Desloratadine Tablet .
In subjects 2 to 5 years old , a single dose of 2 . 5 mL of Desloratadine Oral solution containing 1 . 25 mg of desloratadine , resulted in desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 - mg Desloratadine Tablet .
However , the C max and AUC of the metabolite ( 3 - hydroxydesloratadine ) were 1 . 27 and 1 . 61 times higher for the 5 mg dose of Oral solution administered in adults compared to the C max and AUC obtained in children 2 to 11 years of age receiving 1 . 25 - 2 . 5 mg of Desloratadine Oral solution .
A single dose of either 2 . 5 mL or 1 . 25 mL of Desloratadine Oral solution containing 1 . 25 mg or 0 . 625 mg , respectively , of desloratadine was administered to subjects 6 to 11 months of age and 12 to 23 months of age .
The results of a population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that a dose of 1 mg for subjects aged 6 to 11 months and 1 . 25 mg for subjects 12 to 23 months of age is required to obtain desloratadine plasma concentrations similar to those achieved in adults administered a single 5 mg dose of Desloratadine Oral solution .
Renally Impaired : Desloratadine pharmacokinetics following a single dose of 7 . 5 mg were characterized in patients with mild ( n = 7 ; creatinine clearance 51 - 69 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 ) , moderate ( n = 6 ; creatinine clearance 34 - 43 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 ) , and severe ( n = 6 ; creatinine clearance 5 - 29 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 ) renal impairment or hemodialysis dependent ( n = 6 ) patients .
In patients with mild and moderate renal impairment , median C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1 . 2 - and 1 . 9 - fold , respectively , relative to subjects with normal renal function .
In patients with severe renal impairment or who were hemodialysis dependent , C max and AUC values increased by approximately 1 . 7 - and 2 . 5 - fold , respectively .
Minimal changes in 3 - hydroxydesloratadine concentrations were observed .
Desloratadine and 3 - hydroxydesloratadine were poorly removed by hemodialysis .
Plasma protein binding of desloratadine and 3 - hydroxydesloratadine was unaltered by renal impairment .
Dosage adjustment for patients with renal impairment is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Hepatically Impaired : Desloratadine pharmacokinetics were characterized following a single oral dose in patients with mild ( n = 4 ) , moderate ( n = 4 ) , and severe ( n = 4 ) hepatic impairment as defined by the Child - Pugh classification of hepatic function and 8 subjects with normal hepatic function .
Patients with hepatic impairment , regardless of severity , had approximately a 2 . 4 - fold increase in AUC as compared with normal subjects .
The apparent oral clearance of desloratadine in patients with mild , moderate , and severe hepatic impairment was 37 % , 36 % , and 28 % of that in normal subjects , respectively .
An increase in the mean elimination half - life of desloratadine in patients with hepatic impairment was observed .
For 3 - hydroxydesloratadine , the mean C max and AUC values for patients with hepatic impairment were not statistically significantly different from subjects with normal hepatic function .
Dosage adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Gender : Female subjects treated for 14 days with Desloratadine Tablets had 10 % and 3 % higher desloratadine C max and AUC values , respectively , compared with male subjects .
The 3 - hydroxydesloratadine C max and AUC values were also increased by 45 % and 48 % , respectively , in females compared with males .
However , these apparent differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dosage adjustment is recommended .
Race : Following 14 days of treatment with Desloratadine Tablets , the C max and AUC values for desloratadine were 18 % and 32 % higher , respectively , in Blacks compared with Caucasians .
For 3 - hydroxydesloratadine there was a corresponding 10 % reduction in C max and AUC values in Blacks compared to Caucasians .
These differences are not likely to be clinically relevant and therefore no dose adjustment is recommended .
Drug Interactions : In two controlled crossover clinical pharmacology studies in healthy male ( n = 12 in each study ) and female ( n = 12 in each study ) volunteers , desloratadine 7 . 5 mg ( 1 . 5 times the daily dose ) once daily was coadministered with erythromycin 500 mg every 8 hours or ketoconazole 200 mg every 12 hours for 10 days .
In three separate controlled , parallel group clinical pharmacology studies , desloratadine at the clinical dose of 5 mg has been coadministered with azithromycin 500 mg followed by 250 mg once daily for 4 days ( n = 18 ) or with fluoxetine 20 mg once daily for 7 days after a 23 - day pretreatment period with fluoxetine ( n = 18 ) or with cimetidine 600 mg every 12 hours for 14 days ( n = 18 ) under steady - state conditions to normal healthy male and female volunteers .
Although increased plasma concentrations ( C max and AUC 0 - 24 hrs ) of desloratadine and 3 - hydroxydesloratadine were observed ( see Table 2 ) , there were no clinically relevant changes in the safety profile of desloratadine , as assessed by electrocardiographic parameters ( including the corrected QT interval ) , clinical laboratory tests , vital signs , and adverse events .

In a 2 - year study in rats , loratadine was administered in the diet at doses up to 25 mg / kg / day ( estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 30 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose ) .
A significantly higher incidence of hepatocellular tumors ( combined adenomas and carcinomas ) was observed in males given 10 mg / kg / day of loratadine and in males and females given 25 mg / kg / day of loratadine .
The estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures in rats given 10 mg / kg of loratadine were approximately 7 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose .
The clinical significance of these findings during long - term use of desloratadine is not known .
In a 2 - year dietary study in mice , males and females given up to 16 mg / kg / day and 32 mg / kg / day desloratadine , respectively , did not show significant increases in the incidence of any tumors .
The estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures in mice at these doses were 12 and 27 times , respectively , the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose .
Genotoxicity Studies : In genotoxicity studies with desloratadine , there was no evidence of genotoxic potential in a reverse mutation assay ( Salmonella / E .
coli mammalian microsome bacterial mutagenicity assay ) or in 2 assays for chromosomal aberrations ( human peripheral blood lymphocyte clastogenicity assay and mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay ) .
Impairment of Fertility : There was no effect on female fertility in rats at desloratadine doses up to 24 mg / kg / day ( estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 130 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose ) .
A male specific decrease in fertility , demonstrated by reduced female conception rates , decreased sperm numbers and motility , and histopathologic testicular changes , occurred at an oral desloratadine dose of 12 mg / kg in rats ( estimated desloratadine and desloratadine metabolite exposures were approximately 45 times the AUC in humans at the recommended daily oral dose ) .
