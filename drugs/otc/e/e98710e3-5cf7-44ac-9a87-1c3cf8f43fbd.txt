1 INDICATIONS & USAGE Therapy with lipid - altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia .
Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate .
Ezetimibe Tabletis an inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol ( and related phytosterol ) absorption indicated as an adjunct to diet to : • Reduce elevated total - C , LDL - C , Apo B , and non - HDL - C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia , alone or in combination with an HMG - CoA reductase inhibitor ( statin ) ( 1 . 1 ) • Reduce elevated total - C , LDL - C , Apo B , and non - HDL - C in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia in combination with fenofibrate ( 1 . 1 ) • Reduce elevated total - C and LDL - C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ( HoFH ) , in combination with atorvastatin or simvastatin ( 1 . 2 ) • Reduce elevated sitosterol and campesterol in patients with homozygous sitosterolemia ( phytosterolemia ) ( 1 . 3 ) Limitations of Use ( 1 . 4 ) • The effect of Ezetimibe Tablets on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined .
• Ezetimibe Tablets has not been studied in Fredrickson Type I , III , IV , and V dyslipidemias .
1 . 1 Primary Hyperlipidemia Monotherapy Ezetimibe Tablets , administered alone , is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for the reduction of elevated total cholesterol ( total - C ) , low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL - C ) , apolipoprotein B ( Apo B ) , and non - high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( non - HDL - C ) in patients with primary ( heterozygous familial and non - familial ) hyperlipidemia .
Combination Therapy with HMG - CoA Reductase Inhibitors ( Statins ) Ezetimibe Tablets , administered in combination with a 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl - coenzyme A ( HMG - CoA ) reductase inhibitor ( statin ) , is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for the reduction of elevated total - C , LDL - C , Apo B , and non - HDL - C in patients with primary ( heterozygous familial and non - familial ) hyperlipidemia .
Combination Therapy with Fenofibrate Ezetimibe Tablets , administered in combination with fenofibrate , is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for the reduction of elevated total - C , LDL - C , Apo B , and non - HDL - C in adult patients with mixed hyperlipidemia .
1 . 2 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia ( HoFH ) The combination of Ezetimibe Tablets and atorvastatin or simvastatin is indicated for the reduction of elevated total - C and LDL - C levels in patients with HoFH , as an adjunct to other lipid - lowering treatments ( e . g . , LDL apheresis ) or if such treatments are unavailable .
1 . 3 Homozygous Sitosterolemia Ezetimibe Tablet is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for the reduction of elevated sitosterol and campesterol levels in patients with homozygous familial sitosterolemia .

2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION • One 10 - mg tablet once daily , with or without food ( 2 . 1 ) • Dosing of Ezetimibe Tablets should occur either ≥ 2 hours before or ≥ 4 hours after administration of a bile acid sequestrant .
( 2 . 3 , 7 . 4 ) 2 . 1 General Dosing Information The recommended dose of Ezetimibe Tablets is 10 mg once daily .
Ezetimibe Tablets can be administered with or without food .
2 . 2 Concomitant Lipid - Lowering Therapy Ezetimibe Tablets may be administered with a statin ( in patients with primary hyperlipidemia ) or with fenofibrate ( in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia ) for incremental effect .
For convenience , the daily dose of Ezetimibe Tablets may be taken at the same time as the statin or fenofibrate , according to the dosing recommendations for the respective medications .
2 . 3 Co - Administration with Bile Acid Sequestrants Dosing of Ezetimibe Tablets should occur either ≥ 2 hours before or ≥ 4 hours after administration of a bile acid sequestrant [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) ] .
2 . 4 Patients with Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
2 . 5 Patients with Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
When given with simvastatin in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment ( estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , doses of simvastatin exceeding 20 mg should be used with caution and close monitoring [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
2 . 6 Geriatric Patients No dosage adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
3 DOSAGE FORMS & STRENGTHS 10 - mg tablets are white to off white capsule shaped , flat faced , beveled edge tablets , debossed with “ A25ˮ on one side and plain on other side .
• Tablets : 10 mg ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Ezetimibe Tablet is contraindicated in the following conditions : • The combination of Ezetimibe Tablets with a statin is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels .
• Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant .
Because statins decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol , Ezetimibe Tablets in combination with a statin may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women .
Additionally , there is no apparent benefit to therapy during pregnancy , and safety in pregnant women has not been established .
If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy .
[ See Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) . ]
• Nursing mothers .
Because statins may pass into breast milk , and because statins have the potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants , women who require Ezetimibe Tablets treatment in combination with a statin should be advised not to nurse their infants [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
• Patients with a known hypersensitivity to any component of this product .
Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis , angioedema , rash and urticaria have been reported with Ezetimibe Tablets [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
• Statin contraindications apply when Ezetimibe Tablet is used with a statin : • Active liver disease , which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels ( 4 , 5 . 2 ) • Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant ( 4 , 8 . 1 ) • Nursing mothers ( 4 , 8 . 3 ) • Known hypersensitivity to product components ( 4 , 6 . 2 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Ezetimibe Tablet is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment .
( 5 . 4 , 8 . 7 , 12 . 3 ) • Liver enzyme abnormalities and monitoring : Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase can occur when Ezetimibe Tablet is added to a statin .
Therefore , when Ezetimibe Tablet is added to statin therapy , monitor hepatic transaminase levels before and during treatment according to the recommendations for the individual statin used .
( 5 . 2 ) • Skeletal muscle effects ( e . g . , myopathy and rhabdomyolysis ) : • Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in patients treated with Ezetimibe Tablets co - administered with a statin and with Ezetimibe Tablets administered alone .
Risk for skeletal muscle toxicity increases with higher doses of statin , advanced age ( > 65 ) , hypothyroidism , renal impairment , and depending on the statin used , concomitant use of other drugs .
( 5 . 3 , 6 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Use with Statins or Fenofibrate Concurrent administration of Ezetimibe Tablets with a specific statin or fenofibrate should be in accordance with the product labeling for that medication .
5 . 2 Liver Enzymes In controlled clinical monotherapy studies , the incidence of consecutive elevations ( ≥ 3 x the upper limit of normal [ ULN ] ) in hepatic transaminase levels was similar between Ezetimibe Tablets ( 0 . 5 % ) and placebo ( 0 . 3 % ) .
In controlled clinical combination studies of Ezetimibe Tablets initiated concurrently with a statin , the incidence of consecutive elevations ( ≥ 3 x ULN ) in hepatic transaminase levels was 1 . 3 % for patients treated with Ezetimibe Tablets administered with statins and 0 . 4 % for patients treated with statins alone .
These elevations in transaminases were generally asymptomatic , not associated with cholestasis , and returned to baseline after discontinuation of therapy or with continued treatment .
When Ezetimibe Tablet is co - administered with a statin , liver tests should be performed at initiation of therapy and according to the recommendations of the statin .
Should an increase in ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN persist , consider withdrawal of Ezetimibe Tablets and / or the statin .
5 . 3 Myopathy / Rhabdomyolysis In clinical trials , there was no excess of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis associated with Ezetimibe Tablets compared with the relevant control arm ( placebo or statin alone ) .
However , myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are known adverse reactions to statins and other lipid - lowering drugs .
In clinical trials , the incidence of creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) > 10 x ULN was 0 . 2 % for Ezetimibe Tablets vs . 0 . 1 % for placebo , and 0 . 1 % for Ezetimibe Tablets co - administered with a statin vs . 0 . 4 % for statins alone .
Risk for skeletal muscle toxicity increases with higher doses of statin , advanced age ( > 65 ) , hypothyroidism , renal impairment , and depending on the statin used , concomitant use of other drugs .
In post - marketing experience with Ezetimibe Tablets , cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported .
Most patients who developed rhabdomyolysis were taking a statin prior to initiating Ezetimibe Tablets .
However , rhabdomyolysis has been reported with Ezetimibe Tablets monotherapy and with the addition of Ezetimibe Tablets to agents known to be associated with increased risk of rhabdomyolysis , such as fibrates .
Ezetimibe Tablets and any statin or fibrate that the patient is taking concomitantly should be immediately discontinued if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected .
The presence of muscle symptoms and a CPK level > 10 x the ULN indicates myopathy .
5 . 4 Hepatic Impairment Due to the unknown effects of the increased exposure to ezetimibe in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment , Ezetimibe Tablet is not recommended in these patients .
[ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) . ]

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
Monotherapy In 10 double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trials , 2396 patients with primary hyperlipidemia ( age range 9 to 86 years , 50 % women , 90 % Caucasians , 5 % Blacks , 3 % Hispanics , 2 % Asians ) and elevated LDL - C were treated with Ezetimibe Tablets 10 mg / day for a median treatment duration of 12 weeks ( range 0 to 39 weeks ) .
Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2 % of patients treated with Ezetimibe Tablets and at an incidence greater than placebo in placebo - controlled studies of Ezetimibe Tablets , regardless of causality assessment , are shown in Table 1 .
TABLE 1 : Clinical Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥ 2 % of Patients Treated with Ezetimibe Tablets and at an Incidence Greater than Placebo , Regardless of Causality Body System / Organ Class Adverse Reaction Ezetimibe Tablets 10 mg ( % ) n = 2396 Placebo ( % ) n = 1159 Gastrointestinal disorders Diarrhea 4 . 1 3 . 7 General disorders and administration site conditions Fatigue 2 . 4 1 . 5 Infections and infestations Influenza 2 . 0 1 . 5 Sinusitis 2 . 8 2 . 2 Upper respiratory tract infection 4 . 3 2 . 5 Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Arthralgia 3 . 0 2 . 2 Pain in extremity 2 . 7 2 . 5 The frequency of less common adverse reactions was comparable between Ezetimibe Tablets and placebo .
Combination with a Statin In 28 double - blind , controlled ( placebo or active - controlled ) clinical trials , 11 , 308 patients with primary hyperlipidemia ( age range 10 to 93 years , 48 % women , 85 % Caucasians , 7 % Blacks , 4 % Hispanics , 3 % Asians ) and elevated LDL - C were treated with Ezetimibe Tablets 10 mg / day concurrently with or added to on - going statin therapy for a median treatment duration of 8 weeks ( range 0 to 112 weeks ) .
The incidence of consecutive increased transaminases ( ≥ 3 x ULN ) was higher in patients receiving Ezetimibe Tablets administered with statins ( 1 . 3 % ) than in patients treated with statins alone ( 0 . 4 % ) .
[ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) . ]
Clinical adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2 % of patients treated with Ezetimibe Tablets + statin and at an incidence greater than statin , regardless of causality assessment , are shown in Table 2 .
TABLE 2 : Clinical Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥ 2 % of Patients Treated with Ezetimibe Tablets Co - Administered with a Statin and at an Incidence Greater than Statin , Regardless of Causality Body System / Organ Class Adverse Reaction All Statins * ( % ) n = 9361 Ezetimibe Tablets + All Statins * ( % ) n = 11 , 308 Gastrointestinal disorders Diarrhea 2 . 2 2 . 5 General disorders and administration site conditions Fatigue 1 . 6 2 . 0 Infections and infestations Influenza 2 . 1 2 . 2 Nasopharyngitis 3 . 3 3 . 7 Upper respiratory tract infection 2 . 8 2 . 9 Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Arthralgia 2 . 4 2 . 6 Back pain 2 . 3 2 . 4 Myalgia 2 . 7 3 . 2 Pain in extremity 1 . 9 2 . 1 * All Statins = all doses of all statins Combination with Fenofibrate This clinical study involving 625 patients with mixed dyslipidemia ( age range 20 to 76 years , 44 % women , 79 % Caucasians , 0 . 1 % Blacks , 11 % Hispanics , 5 % Asians ) treated for up to 12 weeks and 576 patients treated for up to an additional 48 weeks evaluated co - administration of Ezetimibe Tablets and fenofibrate .
This study was not designed to compare treatment groups for infrequent events .
Incidence rates ( 95 % CI ) for clinically important elevations ( ≥ 3 x ULN , consecutive ) in hepatic transaminase levels were 4 . 5 % ( 1 . 9 , 8 . 8 ) and 2 . 7 % ( 1 . 2 , 5 . 4 ) for fenofibrate monotherapy ( n = 188 ) and Ezetimibe Tablets co - administered with fenofibrate ( n = 183 ) , respectively , adjusted for treatment exposure .
Corresponding incidence rates for cholecystectomy were 0 . 6 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 0 % , 3 . 1 % ) and 1 . 7 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 6 % , 4 . 0 % ) for fenofibrate monotherapy and Ezetimibe Tablets co - administered with fenofibrate , respectively [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
The numbers of patients exposed to co - administration therapy as well as fenofibrate and ezetimibe monotherapy were inadequate to assess gallbladder disease risk .
There were no CPK elevations > 10 x ULN in any of the treatment groups .
6 . 2 Post - Marketing Experience Because the reactions below are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of Ezetimibe Tablets : Hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis , angioedema , rash , and urticaria ; erythema multiforme ; arthralgia ; myalgia ; elevated creatine phosphokinase ; myopathy / rhabdomyolysis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] ; elevations in liver transaminases ; hepatitis ; abdominal pain ; thrombocytopenia ; pancreatitis ; nausea ; dizziness ; paresthesia ; depression ; headache ; cholelithiasis ; cholecystitis .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) . ]
• Cyclosporine : Combination increases exposure of Ezetimibe Tablets and cyclosporine .
Cyclosporine concentrations should be monitored in patients taking Ezetimibe Tablets concomitantly .
( 7 . 1 , 12 . 3 ) • Fenofibrate : Combination increases exposure of Ezetimibe Tablets .
If cholelithiasis is suspected in a patient receiving Ezetimibe Tablets and fenofibrate , gallbladder studies are indicated and alternative lipid - lowering therapy should be considered .
( 6 . 1 , 7 . 3 ) • Fibrates : Co - administration of Ezetimibe Tablets with fibrates other than fenofibrate is not recommended until use in patients is adequately studied .
( 7 . 2 ) • Cholestyramine : Combination decreases exposure of Ezetimibe Tablets .
( 2 . 3 , 7 . 4 , 12 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Cyclosporine Caution should be exercised when using Ezetimibe Tablets and cyclosporine concomitantly due to increased exposure to both ezetimibe and cyclosporine .
Cyclosporine concentrations should be monitored in patients receiving Ezetimibe Tablets and cyclosporine .
The degree of increase in ezetimibe exposure may be greater in patients with severe renal insufficiency .
In patients treated with cyclosporine , the potential effects of the increased exposure to ezetimibe from concomitant use should be carefully weighed against the benefits of alterations in lipid levels provided by ezetimibe .
7 . 2 Fibrates The efficacy and safety of co - administration of ezetimibe with fibrates other than fenofibrate have not been studied .
Fibrates may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile , leading to cholelithiasis .
In a preclinical study in dogs , ezetimibe increased cholesterol in the gallbladder bile [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 2 ) ] .
Co - administration of Ezetimibe Tablets with fibrates other than fenofibrate is not recommended until use in patients is adequately studied .
7 . 3 Fenofibrate If cholelithiasis is suspected in a patient receiving Ezetimibe Tablets and fenofibrate , gallbladder studies are indicated and alternative lipid - lowering therapy should be considered [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and the product labeling for fenofibrate ] .
7 . 4 Cholestyramine Concomitant cholestyramine administration decreased the mean area under the curve ( AUC ) of total ezetimibe approximately 55 % .
The incremental LDL - C reduction due to adding ezetimibe to cholestyramine may be reduced by this interaction .
7 . 5 Coumarin Anticoagulants If ezetimibe is added to warfarin , a coumarin anticoagulant , the International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) should be appropriately monitored .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C : There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of ezetimibe in pregnant women .
Ezetimibe should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus .
In oral ( gavage ) embryo - fetal development studies of ezetimibe conducted in rats and rabbits during organogenesis , there was no evidence of embryolethal effects at the doses tested ( 250 , 500 , 1000 mg / kg / day ) .
In rats , increased incidences of common fetal skeletal findings ( extra pair of thoracic ribs , unossified cervical vertebral centra , shortened ribs ) were observed at 1000 mg / kg / day ( ~ 10 x the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0 - 24 hr for total ezetimibe ) .
In rabbits treated with ezetimibe , an increased incidence of extra thoracic ribs was observed at 1000 mg / kg / day ( 150 x the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0 - 24 hr for total ezetimibe ) .
Ezetimibe crossed the placenta when pregnant rats and rabbits were given multiple oral doses .
Multiple - dose studies of ezetimibe given in combination with statins in rats and rabbits during organogenesis result in higher ezetimibe and statin exposures .
Reproductive findings occur at lower doses in combination therapy compared to monotherapy .
All statins are contraindicated in pregnant and nursing women .
When Ezetimibe Tablet is administered with a statin in a woman of childbearing potential , refer to the pregnancy category and product labeling for the statin .
[ See Contraindications ( 4 ) . ]
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether ezetimibe is excreted into human breast milk .
In rat studies , exposure to total ezetimibe in nursing pups was up to half of that observed in maternal plasma .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when Ezetimibe Tablet is administered to a nursing woman .
Ezetimibe Tablets should not be used in nursing mothers unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the infant .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The effects of Ezetimibe Tablets co - administered with simvastatin ( n = 126 ) compared to simvastatin monotherapy ( n = 122 ) have been evaluated in adolescent boys and girls with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ( HeFH ) .
In a multicenter , double - blind , controlled study followed by an open - label phase , 142 boys and 106 postmenarchal girls , 10 to 17 years of age ( mean age 14 . 2 years , 43 % females , 82 % Caucasians , 4 % Asian , 2 % Blacks , 13 % multi - racial ) with HeFH were randomized to receive either Ezetimibe Tablets co - administered with simvastatin or simvastatin monotherapy .
Inclusion in the study required 1 ) a baseline LDL - C level between 160 and 400 mg / dL and 2 ) a medical history and clinical presentation consistent with HeFH .
The mean baseline LDL - C value was 225 mg / dL ( range : 161 to 351 mg / dL ) in the Ezetimibe Tablets co - administered with simvastatin group compared to 219 mg / dL ( range : 149 to 336 mg / dL ) in the simvastatin monotherapy group .
The patients received co - administered Ezetimibe Tablets and simvastatin ( 10 mg , 20 mg , or 40 mg ) or simvastatin monotherapy ( 10 mg , 20 mg , or 40 mg ) for 6 weeks , co - administered Ezetimibe Tablets and 40 mg simvastatin or 40 mg simvastatin monotherapy for the next 27 weeks , and open - label co - administered Ezetimibe Tablets and simvastatin ( 10 mg , 20 mg , or 40 mg ) for 20 weeks thereafter .
The results of the study at Week 6 are summarized in Table 3 .
Results at Week 33 were consistent with those at Week 6 .
TABLE 3 : Mean Percent Difference at Week 6 Between the Pooled Ezetimibe Tablets Co - Administered with Simvastatin Group and the Pooled Simvastatin Monotherapy Group in Adolescent Patients with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia Total - C LDL - C Apo B Non - HDL - C TG * HDL - C Mean percent difference between treatment groups - 12 % - 15 % - 12 % - 14 % - 2 % + 0 . 1 % 95 % Confidence Interval ( - 15 % , - 9 % ) ( - 18 % , - 12 % ) ( - 15 % , - 9 % ) ( - 17 % , - 11 % ) ( - 9 % , + 4 % ) ( - 3 % , + 3 % ) * For triglycerides , median % change from baseline From the start of the trial to the end of Week 33 , discontinuations due to an adverse reaction occurred in 7 ( 6 % ) patients in the Ezetimibe Tablets co - administered with simvastatin group and in 2 ( 2 % ) patients in the simvastatin monotherapy group .
During the trial , hepatic transaminase elevations ( two consecutive measurements for ALT and / or AST ≥ 3 x ULN ) occurred in four ( 3 % ) individuals in the Ezetimibe Tablets co - administered with simvastatin group and in two ( 2 % ) individuals in the simvastatin monotherapy group .
Elevations of CPK ( ≥ 10 x ULN ) occurred in two ( 2 % ) individuals in the Ezetimibe Tablets co - administered with simvastatin group and in zero individuals in the simvastatin monotherapy group .
In this limited controlled study , there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in the adolescent boys or girls , or on menstrual cycle length in girls .
Co - administration of Ezetimibe Tablets with simvastatin at doses greater than 40 mg / day has not been studied in adolescents .
Also , Ezetimibe Tablets has not been studied in patients younger than 10 years of age or in pre - menarchal girls .
Based on total ezetimibe ( ezetimibe + ezetimibe - glucuronide ) , there are no pharmacokinetic differences between adolescents and adults .
Pharmacokinetic data in the pediatric population < 10 years of age are not available .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Monotherapy Studies Of the 2396 patients who received Ezetimibe Tablets in clinical studies , 669 ( 28 % ) were 65 and older , and 111 ( 5 % ) were 75 and older .
Statin Co - Administration Studies Of the 11 , 308 patients who received Ezetimibe Tablets + statin in clinical studies , 3587 ( 32 % ) were 65 and older , and 924 ( 8 % ) were 75 and older .
No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment When used as monotherapy , no dosage adjustment of Ezetimibe Tablets is necessary .
In the Study of Heart and Renal Protection ( SHARP ) trial of 9270 patients with moderate to severe renal impairment ( 6247 non - dialysis patients with median serum creatinine 2 . 5 mg / dL and median estimated glomerular filtration rate 25 . 6 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 , and 3023 dialysis patients ) , the incidence of serious adverse events , adverse events leading to discontinuation of study treatment , or adverse events of special interest ( musculoskeletal adverse events , liver enzyme abnormalities , incident cancer ) was similar between patients ever assigned to ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 20 mg ( n = 4650 ) or placebo ( n = 4620 ) during a median follow - up of 4 . 9 years .
However , because renal impairment is a risk factor for statin - associated myopathy , doses of simvastatin exceeding 20 mg should be used with caution and close monitoring when administered concomitantly with Ezetimibe Tablets in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Ezetimibe Tablet is not recommended in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Ezetimibe Tablets given concomitantly with a statin is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or unexplained persistent elevations of hepatic transaminase levels [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ; Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE In clinical studies , administration of ezetimibe , 50 mg / day to 15 healthy subjects for up to 14 days , 40 mg / day to 18 patients with primary hyperlipidemia for up to 56 days , and 40 mg / day to 27 patients with homozygous sitosterolemia for 26 weeks was generally well tolerated .
One female patient with homozygous sitosterolemia took an accidental overdose of ezetimibe 120 mg / day for 28 days with no reported clinical or laboratory adverse events .
In the event of an overdose , symptomatic and supportive measures should be employed .
11 DESCRIPTION Ezetimibe , USP is in a class of lipid - lowering compounds that selectively inhibits the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and related phytosterols .
The chemical name of ezetimibe , USP is 1 - ( 4 - fluorophenyl ) - 3 ( R ) - [ 3 - ( 4 - fluorophenyl ) - 3 ( S ) - hydroxypropyl ] - 4 ( S ) - ( 4 - hydroxyphenyl ) - 2 - azetidinone .
The empirical formula is C24H21F2NO3 .
Its molecular weight is 409 . 4 and its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Ezetimibe , USP is a white to off white , crystalline powder that is soluble in methanol .
Ezetimibe , USP has a melting point of about 163 ° C and is stable at ambient temperature .
Ezetimibe Tablet , USP is available as a tablet for oral administration containing 10 mg of ezetimibe , USP and the following inactive ingredients : lactose monohydrate , croscarmellose sodium , Hypromellose , sodium lauryl sulfate , crospovidone , microcrystaline cellulose , and magnesium stearate .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Ezetimibe reduces blood cholesterol by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol by the small intestine .
In a 2 - week clinical study in 18 hypercholesterolemic patients , Ezetimibe Tablets inhibited intestinal cholesterol absorption by 54 % , compared with placebo .
Ezetimibe Tablets had no clinically meaningful effect on the plasma concentrations of the fat - soluble vitamins A , D , and E ( in a study of 113 patients ) , and did not impair adrenocortical steroid hormone production ( in a study of 118 patients ) .
The cholesterol content of the liver is derived predominantly from three sources .
The liver can synthesize cholesterol , take up cholesterol from the blood from circulating lipoproteins , or take up cholesterol absorbed by the small intestine .
Intestinal cholesterol is derived primarily from cholesterol secreted in the bile and from dietary cholesterol .
Ezetimibe has a mechanism of action that differs from those of other classes of cholesterol - reducing compounds ( statins , bile acid sequestrants [ resins ] , fibric acid derivatives , and plant stanols ) .
The molecular target of ezetimibe has been shown to be the sterol transporter , Niemann - Pick C1 - Like 1 ( NPC1L1 ) , which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols .
Ezetimibe does not inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver , or increase bile acid excretion .
Instead , ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol , leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver .
This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood ; this distinct mechanism is complementary to that of statins and of fenofibrate [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of total - C , LDL - C and Apo B , the major protein constituent of LDL , promote human atherosclerosis .
In addition , decreased levels of HDL - C are associated with the development of atherosclerosis .
Epidemiologic studies have established that cardiovascular morbidity and mortality vary directly with the level of total - C and LDL - C and inversely with the level of HDL - C .
Like LDL , cholesterol - enriched triglyceride - rich lipoproteins , including very - low - density lipoproteins ( VLDL ) , intermediate - density lipoproteins ( IDL ) , and remnants , can also promote atherosclerosis .
The independent effect of raising HDL - C or lowering TG on the risk of coronary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined .
Ezetimibe Tablets reduces total - C , LDL - C , Apo B , non - HDL - C , and TG , and increases HDL - C in patients with hyperlipidemia .
Administration of Ezetimibe Tablets with a statin is effective in improving serum total - C , LDL - C , Apo B , non - HDL - C , TG , and HDL - C beyond either treatment alone .
Administration of Ezetimibe Tablets with fenofibrate is effective in improving serum total - C , LDL - C , Apo B , and non - HDL - C in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia as compared to either treatment alone .
The effects of ezetimibe given either alone or in addition to a statin or fenofibrate on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have not been established .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration , ezetimibe is absorbed and extensively conjugated to a pharmacologically active phenolic glucuronide ( ezetimibe - glucuronide ) .
After a single 10 - mg dose of Ezetimibe Tablets to fasted adults , mean ezetimibe peak plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) of 3 . 4 to 5 . 5 ng / mL were attained within 4 to 12 hours ( Tmax ) .
Ezetimibe - glucuronide mean Cmax values of 45 to 71 ng / mL were achieved between 1 and 2 hours ( Tmax ) .
There was no substantial deviation from dose proportionality between 5 and 20 mg .
The absolute bioavailability of ezetimibecannot be determined , as the compound is virtually insoluble in aqueous media suitable for injection .
Effect of Food on Oral Absorption Concomitant food administration ( high - fat or non - fat meals ) had no effect on the extent of absorption of ezetimibe when administered as Ezetimibe tablets 10 - mg tablets .
The Cmax value of ezetimibe was increased by 38 % with consumption of high - fat meals .
Ezetimibe Tablets can be administered with or without food .
Distribution Ezetimibe and ezetimibe - glucuronide are highly bound ( > 90 % ) to human plasma proteins .
Metabolism and Excretion Ezetimibe is primarily metabolized in the small intestine and liver via glucuronide conjugation ( a phase II reaction ) with subsequent biliary and renal excretion .
Minimal oxidative metabolism ( a phase I reaction ) has been observed in all species evaluated .
In humans , ezetimibe is rapidly metabolized to ezetimibe - glucuronide .
Ezetimibe and ezetimibe - glucuronide are the majordrug - derived compounds detected in plasma , constituting approximately 10 to 20 % and 80 to 90 % of the total drug in plasma , respectively .
Both ezetimibe and ezetimibe - glucuronide are eliminated from plasma with a half - life of approximately 22 hours for both ezetimibe and ezetimibe - glucuronide .
Plasma concentration - time profiles exhibit multiple peaks , suggesting enterohepatic recycling .
Following oral administration of 14 C - ezetimibe ( 20 mg ) to human subjects , total ezetimibe ( ezetimibe + ezetimibe - glucuronide ) accounted for approximately 93 % of the total radioactivity in plasma .
After 48 hours , there were no detectable levels of radioactivity in the plasma .
Approximately 78 % and 11 % of the administered radio activity were recovered in the feces and urine , respectively , over a 10 - day collection period .
Ezetimibe was the major component in feces and accounted for 69 % of the administered dose , while ezetimibe - glucuronide was the major component in urine and accounted for 9 % of the administered dose .
Specific Populations Geriatric Patients : In a multiple - dose study with ezetimibe given 10 mg once daily for 10 days , plasma concentrations for total ezetimibe were about 2 - fold higher in older ( ≥ 65 years ) healthy subjects compared to younger subjects .
Pediatric Patients : [ See Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) . ]
Gender : In a multiple - dose study with ezetimibe given 10 mg once daily for 10 days , plasma concentrations for total ezetimibe were slightly higher ( < 20 % ) in women than in men .
Race : Based on a meta - analysis of multiple - dose pharmacokinetic studies , there were no pharmacokinetic differences between Black and Caucasian subjects .
Studies in Asian subjects indicated that the pharmacokinetics of ezetimibe were similar to those seen in Caucasian subjects .
HepaticImpairment : After a single 10 - mg dose of ezetimibe , the mean AUC for total ezetimibe was increased approximately 1 . 7 - fold in patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh score 5 to 6 ) , compared to healthy subjects .
The mean AUC values for total ezetimibe and ezetimibe were increased approximately 3 - to 4 - fold and 5 - to 6 - fold , respectively , in patients with moderate ( Child - Pugh score 7 to 9 ) or severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh score 10 to 15 ) .
In a 14 - day , multiple - dose study ( 10 mg daily ) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment , the mean AUC values for total ezetimibe and ezetimibe were increased approximately 4 - fold on Day 1 and Day 14 compared to healthy subjects .
Due to the unknown effects ofthe increased exposure to ezetimibe in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment , Ezetimibe Tablet is not recommended in these patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Renal Impairment : After a single 10 - mg dose of ezetimibe in patients with severe renal disease ( n = 8 ; mean CrCl ≤ 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , the mean AUC values for total ezetimibe , ezetimibe - glucuronide , and ezetimibe were increased approximately 1 . 5 - fold , compared to healthy subjects ( n = 9 ) .
Drug Interactions [ See also Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] Ezetimibe Tablets had no significant effect on a series of probe drugs ( caffeine , dextromethorphan , tolbutamide , and IVmidazolam ) known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 ( 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C8 / 9 and 3A4 ) in a “ cocktail ” study of twelve healthy adult males .
This indicates that ezetimibe is neither an inhibitor nor an inducer of these cytochrome P450 isozymes , and it is unlikely that ezetimibe will affect the metabolism of drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility A 104 - week dietary carcinogenicity study with ezetimibe was conducted in rats at doses up to 1500 mg / kg / day ( males ) and 500 mg / kg / day ( females ) ( ~ 20 x the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0 - 24 hr for total ezetimibe ) .
A 104 - week dietary carcinogenicity study with ezetimibe was also conducted in mice at doses up to 500 mg / kg / day ( > 150 x the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0 - 24 hr for total ezetimibe ) .
There were no statistically significant increases in tumor incidences in drug - treated rats or mice .
No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in vitro in a microbial mutagenicity ( Ames ) test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli with or without metabolic activation .
No evidence of clastogenicity was observed in vitro in a chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation .
In addition , there was no evidence of genotoxicity in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test .
In oral ( gavage ) fertility studies of ezetimibe conducted in rats , there was no evidence of reproductive toxicity at doses up to 1000 mg / kg / day in male or female rats ( ~ 7 x the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0 - 24 hr for total ezetimibe ) .
13 . 2 Animal Pharmacology & OR Toxicology The hypocholesterolemic effect of ezetimibe was evaluated in cholesterol - fed Rhesus monkeys , dogs , rats , and mouse models of human cholesterol metabolism .
Ezetimibe was found to have an ED50 value of 0 . 5 mcg / kg / day for inhibiting the rise in plasma cholesterol levels in monkeys .
The ED50 values in dogs , rats , and mice were 7 , 30 , and 700 mcg / kg / day , respectively .
These results are consistent with Ezetimibe Tablets being a potent cholesterol absorption inhibitor .
In a rat model , where the glucuronide metabolite of ezetimibe ( SCH 60663 ) was administered intraduodenally , the metabolite was as potent as the parent compound ( SCH 58235 ) in inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol , suggesting that the glucuronide metabolite had activity similar to the parent drug .
In 1 - month studies in dogs given ezetimibe ( 0 . 03 to 300 mg / kg / day ) , the concentration of cholesterol in gallbladder bile increased ~ 2 - to 4 - fold .
However , a dose of 300 mg / kg / day administered to dogs for one year did not result in gallstone formation or any other adverse hepatobiliary effects .
In a 14 - day study in mice given ezetimibe ( 0 . 3 to 5 mg / kg / day ) and fed a low - fat or cholesterol - rich diet , the concentration of cholesterol in gallbladder bile was either unaffected or reduced to normal levels , respectively .
A series of acute preclinical studies was performed to determine the selectivity of Ezetimibe Tablets for inhibiting cholesterol absorption .
Ezetimibe inhibited the absorption of 14 C - cholesterol with no effect on the absorption of triglycerides , fatty acids , bile acids , progesterone , ethinyl estradiol , or the fat - soluble vitamins A and D .
In 4 - to 12 - week toxicity studies in mice , ezetimibe did not induce cytochrome P450 drug metabolizing enzymes .
In toxicity studies , a pharmacokinetic interaction of ezetimibe with statins ( parents or their active hydroxy acid metabolites ) was seen in rats , dogs , and rabbits .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Primary Hyperlipidemia Ezetimibe Tablets reduces total - C , LDL - C , Apo B , non - HDL - C , and TG , and increases HDL - C in patients with hyperlipidemia .
Maximal to near maximal response is generally achieved within 2 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy .
Monotherapy In two multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled , 12 - week studies in 1719 patients with primary hyperlipidemia , Ezetimibe Tablets significantly lowered total - C , LDL - C , Apo B , non - HDL - C , and TG , and increased HDL - C compared to placebo ( see Table6 ) .
Reduction in LDL - C was consistent across age , sex , and baseline LDL - C .

Combination with Statins Ezetimibe Tablets Added to On - going Statin Therapy In a multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled , 8 - week study , 769 patients with primary hyperlipidemia , known coronary heart disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors who were already receiving statin monotherapy , but who had not met their NCEP ATP II target LDL - C goal were randomized to receive either Ezetimibe Tablets or placebo in addition to their on - going statin .
Ezetimibe Tablets , added to on - going statin therapy , significantly lowered total - C , LDL - C , Apo B , non - HDL - C , and TG , and increased HDL - C compared with a statin administered alone ( see Table 7 ) .
LDL - C reductions induced by Ezetimibe Tablets were generally consistent across all statins .

Ezetimibe Tablets Initiated Concurrently with a Statin In four multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled , 12 - week trials , in 2382 hyperlipidemic patients , Ezetimibe Tablets or placebo was administered alone or with various doses of atorvastatin , simvastatin , pravastatin , or lovastatin .
When all patients receiving Ezetimibe Tablets with a statin were compared to all those receiving the corresponding statin alone , Ezetimibe Tablets significantly lowered total - C , LDL - C , Apo B , non - HDL - C , and TG , and , with the exception of pravastatin , increased HDL - C compared to the statin administered alone .
LDL - C reductions induced by Ezetimibe Tablets were generally consistent across all statins .

Combination with Fenofibrate In a multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled , clinical study in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia , 625 patients were treated for up to 12 weeks and 576 for up to an additional 48 weeks .
Patients were randomized to receive placebo , Ezetimibe Tablets alone , 160 mg fenofibrate alone , or Ezetimibe Tablets and 160 mg fenofibrate in the 12 - week study .
After completing the 12 - week study , eligible patients were assigned to Ezetimibe Tablets co - administered with fenofibrate or fenofibrate monotherapy for an additional 48 weeks .
Ezetimibe Tablets co - administered with fenofibrate significantly lowered total - C , LDL - C , Apo B , and non - HDL - C compared to fenofibrate administered alone .
The percent decrease in TG and percent increase in HDL - C for Ezetimibe Tablets co - administered with fenofibrate were comparable to those for fenofibrate administered alone ( see Table 12 ) .

14 . 2 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia ( HoFH ) A study was conducted to assess the efficacy of Ezetimibe Tablets in the treatment of HoFH .
This double - blind , randomized , 12 - week study enrolled 50 patients with a clinical and / or genotypic diagnosis of HoFH , with or without concomitant LDL apheresis , already receiving atorvastatin or simvastatin ( 40 mg ) .
Patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups , atorvastatin or simvastatin ( 80 mg ) , Ezetimibe Tablets administered with atorvastatin or simvastatin ( 40 mg ) , or Ezetimibe Tablets administered with atorvastatin or simvastatin ( 80 mg ) .
Due to decreased bioavailability of ezetimibe in patients concomitantly receiving cholestyramine [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) ] , ezetimibe was dosed at least 4 hours before or after administration of resins .
Mean baseline LDL - C was 341 mg / dL in those patients randomized to atorvastatin 80 mg or simvastatin 80 mg alone and 316 mg / dL in the group randomized to Ezetimibe Tablets plus atorvastatin 40 or 80 mg or simvastatin 40 or 80 mg .
Ezetimibe Tablets , administered with atorvastatin or simvastatin ( 40 and 80 mg statin groups , pooled ) , significantly reduced LDL - C ( 21 % ) compared with increasing the dose of simvastatin or atorvastatin monotherapy from 40 to 80 mg ( 7 % ) .
In those treated with Ezetimibe Tablets plus 80 mg atorvastatin or with Ezetimibe Tablets plus 80 mg simvastatin , LDL - C was reduced by 27 % .
14 . 3 Homozygous Sitosterolemia ( Phytosterolemia ) A study was conducted to assess the efficacy of Ezetimibe Tablets in the treatment of homozygous sitosterolemia .
In this multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled , 8 - week trial , 37 patients with homozygous sitosterolemia with elevated plasma sitosterol levels ( > 5 mg / dL ) on their current therapeutic regimen ( diet , bile - acid - binding resins , statins , ileal bypass surgery and / or LDL apheresis ) , were randomized to receive Ezetimibe Tablets ( n = 30 ) or placebo ( n = 7 ) .
Due to decreased bioavailability of ezetimibe in patients concomitantly receiving cholestyramine [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) ] , ezetimibe was dosed at least 2 hours before or 4 hours after resins were administered .
Excluding the one subject receiving LDL apheresis , Ezetimibe Tablets significantly lowered plasma sitosterol and campesterol , by 21 % and 24 % from baseline , respectively .
In contrast , patients who received placebo had increases in sitosterol and campesterol of 4 % and 3 % from baseline , respectively .
For patients treated with Ezetimibe Tablets , mean plasma levels of plant sterols were reduced progressively over the course of the study .
The effects of reducing plasma sitosterol and campesterol on reducing the risks of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality have not been established .
