Each diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablet , USP contains : 2 . 5 mg of diphenoxylate hydrochloride , USP ( equivalent to 2 . 3 mg of diphenoxylate ) and 0 . 025 mg of atropine sulfate , USP ( equivalent to 0 . 01 mg of atropine ) Diphenoxylate hydrochloride , an antidiarrheal , is ethyl 1 - ( 3 - cyano - 3 , 3 - diphenylpropyl ) - 4 - phenylisonipecotate monohydrochloride and has the following structural formula : [ ChemicalStructureDiphen ] Atropine sulfate , an anticholinergic , is endo - ( ± ) - alpha - ( hydroxymethyl ) benzeneacetic acid 8 - methyl - 8 - azabicylo [ 3 . 2 . 1 ] oct - 3 - yl ester sulfate ( 2 : 1 ) ] ( salt ) monohydrate and has the following structural formula : [ ChemicalStructureAtropine ] A subtherapeutic amount of atropine sulfate is present to discourage deliberate overdosage .
Inactive ingredients of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets include colloidal silicon dioxide , lactose monohydrate , microcrystalline cellulose , pregelatinized starch and stearic acid .
Diphenoxylate is rapidly and extensively metabolized in man by ester hydrolysis to diphenoxylic acid ( difenoxine ) , which is biologically active and the major metabolite in the blood .
After a 5 - mg oral dose of carbon - 14 labeled diphenoxylate hydrochloride in ethanolic solution was given to three healthy volunteers , an average of 14 % of the drug plus its metabolites was excreted in the urine and 49 % in the feces over a four - day period .
Urinary excretion of the unmetabolized drug constituted less than 1 % of the dose , and diphenoxylic acid plus its glucuronide conjugate constituted about 6 % of the dose .
In a 16 - subject crossover bioavailability study , a linear relationship in the dose range of 2 . 5 to 10 mg was found between the dose of diphenoxylate hydrochloride ( given as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate liquid ) and the peak plasma concentration , the area under the plasma concentration - time curve , and the amount of diphenoxylic acid excreted in the urine .
In the same study the bioavailability of the tablet compared with an equal dose of the liquid was approximately 90 % .
The average peak plasma concentration of diphenoxylic acid following ingestion of four 2 . 5 - mg tablets was 163 ng / mL at about 2 hours , and the elimination half - life of diphenoxylic acid was approximately 12 to 14 hours .
In dogs , diphenoxylate hydrochloride has a direct effect on circular smooth muscle of the bowel that conceivably results in segmentation and prolongation of gastrointestinal transit time .
The clinical antidiarrheal action of diphenoxylate hydrochloride may thus be a consequence of enhanced segmentation that allows increased contact of the intraluminal contents with the intestinal mucosa .
Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are indicated as adjunctive therapy in the management of diarrhea in patients 13 years of age and older .
Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in : Pediatric patients less than 6 years of age due to the risks of respiratory and central nervous system ( CNS ) depression ( see WARNINGS ) .

Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : No long - term study in animals has been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential .
Diphenoxylate hydrochloride was administered to male and female rats in their diets to provide dose levels of 4 and 20 mg / kg / day throughout a three - litter reproduction study .
At 50 times the human dose ( 20 mg / kg / day ) , female weight gain was reduced and there was a marked effect on fertility as only 4 of 27 females became pregnant in three test breedings .
The relevance of this finding to usage of diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets in humans is unknown .
Pregnancy : Diphenoxylate hydrochloride has been shown to have an effect on fertility in rats when given in doses 50 times the human dose ( see above discussion ) .
Other findings in this study include a decrease in maternal weight gain of 30 % at 20 mg / kg / day and of 10 % at 4 mg / kg / day .
At 10 times the human dose ( 4 mg / kg / day ) , average litter size was slightly reduced .
Teratology studies were conducted in rats , rabbits , and mice with diphenoxylate hydrochloride at oral doses of 0 . 4 to 20 mg / kg / day .
Due to experimental design and small numbers of litters , embryotoxic , fetotoxic , or teratogenic effects cannot be adequately assessed .
However , examination of the available fetuses did not reveal any indication of teratogenicity .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the anticipated benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Nursing Mothers : Caution should be exercised when diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are administered to a nursing woman , since the physicochemical characteristics of the major metabolite , diphenoxylic acid , are such that it may be excreted in breast milk and since it is known that atropine is excreted in breast milk .

Controlled Substance : Diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets are classified as a Schedule V controlled substance by federal regulation .
Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is chemically related to the narcotic analgesic meperidine .
Drug Abuse and Dependence : In doses used for the treatment of diarrhea , whether acute or chronic , diphenoxylate has not produced addiction .
Diphenoxylate hydrochloride is devoid of morphine - like subjective effects at therapeutic doses .
At high doses it exhibits codeine - like subjective effects .
The dose which produces antidiarrheal action is widely separated from the dose which causes central nervous system effects .
The insolubility of diphenoxylate hydrochloride in commonly available aqueous media precludes intravenous self - administration .
A dose of 100 to 300 mg / day , which is equivalent to 40 to 120 tablets , administered to humans for 40 to 70 days , produced opiate withdrawal symptoms .
Since addiction to diphenoxylate hydrochloride is possible at high doses , the recommended dosage should not be exceeded .
Diagnosis : Overdosage can be life - threatening .
Symptoms of overdosage may include opioid and / or anticholinergic effects including respiratory depression , coma , delirium , lethargy , dryness of the skin and mucous membranes , mydriasis or miosis , flushing , hyperthermia , tachycardia , hypotonia , tachypnea , toxic encephalopathy , seizures and incoherent speech .
Respiratory depression has been reported up to 30 hours after ingestion and may recur despite an initial response to narcotic antagonists .
Treat all possible diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate overdosages as serious and maintain medical observation / hospitalization until patients become asymptomatic without naloxone use .
Treatment : A pure narcotic antagonist ( e . g . , naloxone ) should be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate tablets .
Refer to the prescribing information for naloxone .
Consider diphenoxylate hydrochloride and atropine sulfate toxicity even in settings of negative toxicology tests .
Following initial improvement of respiratory function , repeated doses of naloxone hydrochloride may be required to counteract recurrent respiratory depression .
