1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Guanfacine Extended - Release Tablets are indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy to stimulant medications [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Guanfacine Extended - Release Tablets are a central alpha 2 A - adrenergic receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy to stimulant medications ( 1 , 14 ) .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Recommended dose : 1 mg to 7 mg ( 0 . 05 to 0 . 12 mg / kg target weight based dose range ) once daily in the morning or evening based on clinical response and tolerability ( 2 . 2 ) .
• Begin at a dose of 1 mg once daily and adjust in increments of no more than 1 mg / week ( 2 . 2 ) .
• Do not crush , chew or break tablets before swallowing ( 2 . 1 ) .
• Do not administer with high - fat meals , because of increased exposure ( 2 . 1 ) .
• Do not substitute for immediate - release guanfacine tablets on a mg - per - mg basis , because of differing pharmacokinetic profiles ( 2 . 3 ) .
• If switching from immediate - release guanfacine , discontinue that treatment and titrate with guanfacine extended - release tablets as directed ( 2 . 3 ) .
• When discontinuing , taper the dose in decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 7 days to avoid rebound hypertension ( 2 . 5 ) .
2 . 1 General Instruction for Use Swallow tablets whole .
Do not crush , chew , or break tablets because this will increase the rate of guanfacine release .
Do not administer with high fat meals , due to increased exposure .
2 . 2 Dose Selection Take guanfacine extended - release tablets orally once daily , either in the morning or evening , at approximately the same time each day .
Begin at a dose of 1 mg / day , and adjust in increments of no more than 1 mg / week .
In monotherapy clinical trials , there was dose - and exposure - related clinical improvement as well as risks for several clinically significant adverse reactions ( hypotension , bradycardia , sedative events ) .
To balance the exposure - related potential benefits and risks , the recommended target dose range depending on clinical response and tolerability for guanfacine extended - release tablets is 0 . 05 - 0 . 12 mg / kg / day ( total daily dose between 1 - 7 mg ) ( See Table 1 ) .
Table 1 : Recommended Target Dose Range for Therapy with Guanfacine Extended - Release TabletsWeight Target dose range ( 0 . 05 - 0 . 12 mg / kg / day ) Doses above 4 mg / day have not been evaluated in children ( ages 6 to 12 years ) and doses above 7 mg / day have not been evaluated in adolescents ( ages 13 to 17 years ) 25 - 33 . 9 kg 2 - 3 mg / day 34 - 41 . 4 kg 2 - 4 mg / day 41 . 5 - 49 . 4 kg 3 - 5 mg / day 49 . 5 - 58 . 4 kg 3 - 6 mg / day 58 . 5 - 91 kg 4 - 7 mg / day > 91 kg 5 - 7 mg / day In the adjunctive trial which evaluated guanfacine extended - release tablets treatment with psychostimulants , the majority of patients reached optimal doses in the 0 . 05 - 0 . 12 mg / kg / day range .
Doses above 4 mg / day have not been studied in adjunctive trials .
2 . 3 Switching from Immediate - Release Guanfacine to Guanfacine Extended - Release Tablets If switching from immediate - release guanfacine , discontinue that treatment , and titrate with guanfacine extended - release tablets following above recommended schedule .
Do not substitute for immediate - release guanfacine tablets on a milligram - per - milligram basis , because of differing pharmacokinetic profiles .
Guanfacine extended - release tablets have significantly reduced C max ( 60 % lower ) , bioavailability ( 43 % lower ) , and a delayed T max ( 3 hours later ) compared to those of the same dose of immediate - release guanfacine [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 4 Maintenance Treatment Pharmacological treatment of ADHD may be needed for extended periods .
Healthcare providers should periodically re - evaluate the long - term use of guanfacine extended - release tablets , and adjust weight - based dosage as needed .
The majority of children and adolescents reach optimal doses in the 0 . 05 - 0 . 12 mg / kg / day range .
Doses above 4 mg / day have not been evaluated in children ( ages 6 to 12 years ) and above 7 mg / day have not been evaluated in adolescents ( ages 13 to 17 years ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
2 . 5 Discontinuation of Treatment Following discontinuation of guanfacine extended - release tablets , patients may experience increases in blood pressure and heart rate [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Patients / caregivers should be instructed not to discontinue guanfacine extended - release tablets without consulting their health care provider .
Monitor blood pressure and pulse when reducing the dose or discontinuing the drug .
Taper the daily dose in decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 7 days to minimize the risk of rebound hypertension .
2 . 6 Missed Doses When reinitiating patients to the previous maintenance dose after two or more missed consecutive doses , consider titration based on patient tolerability .
2 . 7 Dosage Adjustment with Concomitant Use of Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Inducers Dosage adjustments for guanfacine extended - release tablets are recommended with concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e . g . , ketoconazole ) , or CYP3A4 inducers ( e . g . , carbamazepine ) ( Table 2 ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Table 2 : Guanfacine Extended - Release Tablets Dosage Adjustments for Patients Taking Concomitant CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Inducers Clinical Scenarios Starting Guanfacine Extended - Release Tablets while currently on a CYP3A4 modulator Continuing Guanfacine Extended - Release Tablets while adding a CYP3A4 modulator Continuing Guanfacine Extended - Release Tablets while stopping a CYP3A4 modulator CYP3A4 Strong and Moderate Inhibitors Decrease guanfacine extended - release tablets dosage to half the recommended level .
( see Table 1 ) Decrease guanfacine extended - release tablets dosage to half the recommended level .

Rash and pruritus have been reported .
History of hypersensitivity to guanfacine extended - release tablets , its inactive ingredients , or other products containing guanfacine ( 4 ) .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypotension , bradycardia , syncope : Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients at risk for hypotension , heart block , bradycardia , syncope , cardiovascular disease , vascular disease , cerebrovascular disease or chronic renal failure .
Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy , following dose increases , and periodically while on therapy .
Avoid concomitant use of drugs with additive effects unless clinically indicated .
Advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated ( 5 . 1 ) .
• Sedation and somnolence : Occur commonly with guanfacine extended - release tablets .
Consider the potential for additive sedative effects with CNS depressant drugs .
Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to guanfacine extended - release tablets ( 5 . 2 ) .
• Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities : May worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular ( AV ) block , especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs .
Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently ( 5 . 3 ) .
• Rebound Hypertension : Abrupt discontinuation of guanfacine extended - release tablets can lead to clinically significant and persistent rebound hypertension .
Subsequent hypertensive encephalopathy was also reported .
To minimize the risk of rebound hypertension upon discontinuation , the total daily dose of guanfacine extended - release tablets should be tapered in decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 7 days ( 5 . 4 ) .
5 . 1 Hypotension , Bradycardia , and Syncope Treatment with guanfacine extended - release tablets can cause dose - dependent decreases in blood pressure and heart rate .
Decreases were less pronounced over time of treatment .
Orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy , following dose increases , and periodically while on therapy .
Titrate guanfacine extended - release tablets slowly in patients with a history of hypotension , and those with underlying conditions that may be worsened by hypotension and bradycardia ; e . g . , heart block , bradycardia , cardiovascular disease , vascular disease , cerebrovascular disease , or chronic renal failure .
In patients who have a history of syncope or may have a condition that predisposes them to syncope , such as hypotension , orthostatic hypotension , bradycardia , or dehydration , advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated .
Monitor blood pressure and heart rate , and adjust dosages accordingly in patients treated concomitantly with antihypertensives or other drugs that can reduce blood pressure or heart rate or increase the risk of syncope .
5 . 2 Sedation and Somnolence Somnolence and sedation were commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Before using guanfacine extended - release tablets with other centrally active depressants , consider the potential for additive sedative effects .
Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to treatment with guanfacine extended - release tablets .
Advise patients to avoid use with alcohol .
5 . 3 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities The sympatholytic action of guanfacine extended - release tablets may worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular ( AV ) block , especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs .
Titrate guanfacine extended - release tablets slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities or patients concomitantly treated with other sympatholytic drugs .
5 . 4 Rebound Hypertension In post marketing experience , abrupt discontinuation of guanfacine extended - release tablets has resulted in clinically significant and persistent rebound hypertension above baseline levels and increases in heart rate .
Hypertensive encephalopathy has also been reported in association with rebound hypertension with both guanfacine extended - release tablets and immediate release guanfacine [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
In these cases , high - dosage guanfacine was discontinued ; concomitant stimulant use was also reported , which may potentially increase hypertensive response upon abrupt discontinuation of guanfacine .
Children commonly have gastrointestinal illnesses that lead to vomiting , and a resulting inability to take medications , so they may be especially at risk for rebound hypertension .
To minimize the risk of rebound hypertension upon discontinuation , the total daily dose of guanfacine extended - release tablets should be tapered in decrements of no more than 1 mg every 3 to 7 days [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Blood pressure and heart rate should be monitored when reducing the dose or discontinuing guanfacine extended - release tablets .
If abrupt discontinuation occurs ( especially with concomitant stimulant use ) , patients should be closely followed for rebound hypertension .

Effects on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate In the monotherapy pediatric , short - term , controlled trials ( Studies 1 and 2 ) , the maximum mean changes from baseline in seated systolic blood pressure , diastolic blood pressure , and pulse were - 5 . 4 mmHg , - 3 . 4 mmHg , and - 5 . 5 bpm , respectively , for all doses combined ( generally one week after reaching target doses ) .
For the respective fixed doses 1 mg / day , 2 mg / day , 3 mg / day or 4 mg / day the maximum mean changes in seated systolic blood pressure were - 4 . 3 mmHg , - 5 . 5 mmHg , - 5 . 4 mmHg and - 8 . 2 mmHg .
For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated diastolic blood pressure were - 3 . 4 mmHg , - 3 . 3 mmHg , - 4 . 4 mmHg and - 5 . 4 mmHg .
For these respective fixed doses the maximum mean changes in seated pulse were - 4 . 8 bpm , - 3 . 1 bpm , - 6 . 5 bpm and - 8 . 6 bpm .
Decreases in blood pressure and heart rate were usually modest and asymptomatic ; however , hypotension and bradycardia can occur .
Hypotension was reported as an adverse reaction for 7 % of the guanfacine extended - release tablets group and 3 % of the placebo group .
This includes orthostatic hypotension , which was reported for 1 % of the guanfacine extended - release tablets group and none in the placebo group .
These findings were generally similar in the monotherapy flexible dose trials ( Studies 4 and 5 ) .
In the adjunctive trial , hypotension ( 3 % ) and bradycardia ( 2 % ) were observed in patients treated with guanfacine extended - release tablets as compared to none in the placebo group .
In long - term , open - label studies , ( mean exposure of approximately 10 months ) , maximum decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure occurred in the first month of therapy .
Decreases were less pronounced over time .
Syncope occurred in 1 % of pediatric patients in the clinical program .
The majority of these cases occurred in the long - term , open - label studies .
Discontinuation of Treatment Blood pressure and pulse may increase above baseline values following discontinuation of guanfacine extended - release tablets .
In five studies of children and adolescents [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] , increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure averaging approximately 3 mmHg and increases in heart rate averaging 5 beats per minute above original baseline were observed upon discontinuation with tapering of guanfacine extended - release tablets .
In a maintenance of efficacy study , increases in blood pressure and heart rate above baseline slowly diminished over the follow up period , which ranged between 3 and 26 weeks post final dose ; the estimated average time to return to baseline was between six and twelve months .
In this study , the increases in blood pressure and pulse were not considered serious or associated with adverse events .
However , individuals may have larger increases than reflected by the mean changes .
In postmarketing experience , following abrupt discontinuation of guanfacine extended - release tablets , rebound hypertension and hypertensive encephalopathy have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Effects on Height , Weight , and Body Mass Index ( BMI ) Patients taking guanfacine extended - release tablets demonstrated similar growth compared to normative data .
Patients taking guanfacine extended - release tablets had a mean increase in weight of 0 . 5 kg compared to those receiving placebo over a comparable treatment period .
Patients receiving guanfacine extended - release tablets for at least 12 months in open - label studies gained an average of 8 kg in weight and 8 cm ( 3 in ) in height .
The height , weight , and BMI percentile remained stable in patients at 12 months in the long - term studies compared to when they began receiving guanfacine extended - release tablets .
Other Adverse Reactions Observed in Clinical Studies Table 13 includes additional adverse reactions observed in short - term , placebo - controlled and long - term , open - label clinical studies not included elsewhere in section 6 . 1 , listed by organ system .

Decrease guanfacine extended - release tablets to 50 % of target dosage when coadministered with strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors ( 2 . 7 ) .
• Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers decrease guanfacine exposure .
Based on patient response , consider titrating guanfacine extended - release tablets dosage up to double the target dosage over 1 to 2 weeks ( 2 . 7 ) .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ADHD medications , including guanfacine extended - release tablets , during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for ADHD Medications at 1 - 866 - 961 - 2388 .
Risk Summary Available data with guanfacine over decades of use in pregnant women have not identified a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
However , use of guanfacine in pregnant women over this time has been infrequent .
In animal reproduction studies , rabbits and rats exposed to 3 and 4 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) , respectively , showed no adverse outcomes .
However , higher doses were associated with reduced fetal survival and maternal toxicity ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Reproduction studies conducted in rats have shown that guanfacine crosses the placenta .
However , administration of guanfacine to rabbits and rats during organogenesis at 3 ( rabbit ) and 4 ( rat ) times the MRHD of 0 . 12 mg / kg / day on a mg / m 2 basis resulted in no evidence of harm to the fetus .
Higher doses ( 13 . 5 times the MRHD in both rabbits and rats ) were associated with reduced fetal survival and maternal toxicity .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of guanfacine in human milk or the effects on the breastfed infant .
The effects on milk production are also unknown .
Guanfacine is present in the milk of lactating rats ( see Data ) .
If a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
If an infant is exposed to guanfacine through breastmilk , monitor for symptoms of hypotension and bradycardia such as sedation , lethargy and poor feeding ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for guanfacine extended - release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from guanfacine extended - release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfeeding infants exposed to guanfacine through breastmilk for sedation , lethargy , and poor feeding .
Data Guanfacine was excreted in breast milk of lactating rats at a concentration comparable to that observed in blood , but slightly less than the concentration in plasma when administered following a single oral dose of 5 mg / kg .
The concentration of drug in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of guanfacine extended - release tablets in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age have not been established .
The efficacy of guanfacine extended - release tablets was studied for the treatment of ADHD in five controlled monotherapy clinical trials ( up to 15 weeks in duration ) , one randomized withdrawal study and one controlled adjunctive trial with psychostimulants ( 8 weeks in duration ) in children and adolescents ages 6 to 17 who met DSM - IV ® criteria for ADHD [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Animal Data In studies in juvenile rats , guanfacine alone produced a slight delay in sexual maturation in males and females at 2 to 3 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) .
Guanfacine in combination with methylphenidate produced a slight delay in sexual maturation and decreased growth as measured by a decrease in bone length in males at a dose of guanfacine comparable to the MRHD and a dose of methylphenidate approximately 4 times the MRHD .
In a study where juvenile rats were treated with guanfacine alone from 7 to 59 days of age , development was delayed as indicated by a slight delay in sexual maturation and decreased body weight gain in males at 2 mg / kg / day and in females at 3 mg / kg / day .
The No Adverse Effect Level ( NOAEL ) for delayed sexual maturation was 1 mg / kg / day , which is equivalent to the MRHD of 4 mg / day , on a mg / m 2 basis .
The effects on fertility were not evaluated in this study .
In a study where juvenile rats were treated with guanfacine in combination with methylphenidate from 7 to 59 days of age , a decrease in ulna bone length and a slight delay in sexual maturation were observed in males given 1 mg / kg / day of guanfacine in combination with 50 mg / kg / day of methylphenidate .
The NOAELs for these findings were 0 . 3 mg / kg of guanfacine in combination with 16 mg / kg / day of methylphenidate , which are equivalent to 0 . 3 and 1 . 4 times the MRHD of 4 mg / day and 54 mg / day for guanfacine and methylphenidate , respectively , on a mg / m 2 basis .
These findings were not observed with guanfacine alone at 1 mg / kg / day or methylphenidate alone at 50 mg / kg / day .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use The safety and efficacy of guanfacine extended - release tablets in geriatric patients have not been established .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment It may be necessary to reduce the dosage in patients with significant impairment of renal function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment It may be necessary to reduce the dosage in patients with significant impairment of hepatic function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9 . 1 Controlled Substance Guanfacine extended - release tablets are not a controlled substance and have no known potential for abuse or dependence .
10 OVERDOSAGE Symptoms Postmarketing reports of guanfacine overdosage indicate that hypotension , drowsiness , lethargy , and bradycardia have been observed following overdose .
Initial hypertension may develop early and may be followed by hypotension .
Similar symptoms have been described in voluntary reports to the American Association of Poison Control Center ’ s National Poison Data System .
Miosis of the pupils may be noted on examination .
No fatal overdoses of guanfacine have been reported in published literature .
Treatment Consult a Certified Poison Control Center by calling 1 - 800 - 222 - 1222 for up - to - date guidance and advice .
Management of guanfacine extended - release tablets overdose should include monitoring for and the treatment of initial hypertension , if that occurs , as well as hypotension , bradycardia , lethargy and respiratory depression .
Children and adolescents who develop lethargy should be observed for the development of more serious toxicity including coma , bradycardia and hypotension for up to 24 hours , due to the possibility of delayed onset hypotension .
11 DESCRIPTION Guanfacine Extended - Release Tablets are a once - daily , extended - release formulation of guanfacine hydrochloride ( HCl ) in a matrix tablet formulation for oral administration only .
The chemical designation is N - amidino - 2 - ( 2 , 6 - dichlorophenyl ) acetamide monohydrochloride .
The molecular formula is C 9 H 9 Cl 2 N 3 O • HCl corresponding to a molecular weight of 282 . 55 g / mol .
The chemical structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Guanfacine HCl is a white to off - white crystalline powder , sparingly soluble in water ( approximately 1 mg / mL ) and alcohol and slightly soluble in acetone .
The only organic solvent in which it has relatively high solubility is methanol ( > 30 mg / mL ) .
Each tablet contains guanfacine HCl equivalent to 1 mg , 2 mg , 3 mg , or 4 mg of guanfacine base .
The tablets also contain copovidone , fumaric acid , glyceryl dibehenate , hypromellose , lactose , methacrylic acid and ethyl acrylate copolymer , microcrystalline cellulose , polysorbate 80 and sodium lauryl sulfate .
In addition , the 3 - mg and 4 - mg tablets also contain FD & C Yellow # 6 Aluminum Lake .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Guanfacine is a central alpha 2 A - adrenergic receptor agonist .
Guanfacine is not a central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant .
The mechanism of action of guanfacine in ADHD is not known .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Guanfacine is a selective central alpha 2 A - adrenergic receptor agonist in that it has a 15 to 20 times higher affinity for this receptor subtype than for the alpha 2 B or alpha 2 C subtypes .
Guanfacine is a known antihypertensive agent .
By stimulating central alpha 2 A - adrenergic receptors , guanfacine reduces sympathetic nerve impulses from the vasomotor center to the heart and blood vessels .
This results in a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance and a reduction in heart rate .
In a thorough QT study , the administration of two dose levels of immediate - release guanfacine ( 4 mg and 8 mg ) produced concentrations approximately 2 to 4 times the concentrations observed with the maximum recommended dose of guanfacine extended - release tablets of 0 . 12 mg / kg .
Guanfacine was not shown to prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution Guanfacine is readily absorbed and approximately 70 % bound to plasma proteins independent of drug concentration .
After oral administration of guanfacine extended - release tablets the time to peak plasma concentration is approximately 5 hours in children and adolescents with ADHD .
Immediate - release guanfacine and guanfacine extended - release tablets have different pharmacokinetic characteristics ; dose substitution on a milligram per milligram basis will result in differences in exposure .
A comparison across studies suggests that the C max is 60 % lower and AUC 0 - ∞ 43 % lower , respectively , for guanfacine extended - release tablets compared to immediate - release guanfacine .
Therefore , the relative bioavailability of guanfacine extended - release tablets to immediate - release guanfacine is 58 % .
The mean pharmacokinetic parameters in adults following the administration of guanfacine extended - release tablets 1 mg once daily and immediate - release guanfacine 1 mg once daily are summarized in Table 15 .
Table 15 : Comparison of Pharmacokinetics : Guanfacine Extended - Release Tablets vs . Immediate - Release Guanfacine in AdultsParameter Guanfacine Extended - Release Tablets 1 mg once daily ( n = 52 ) Immediate - release guanfacine 1 mg once daily ( n = 12 ) Note : Values are mean + / - SD , except for t max which is median ( range ) C max ( ng / mL ) 1 . 0 ± 0 . 3 2 . 5 ± 0 . 6 AUC 0 - ∞ ( ng ∙ h / mL ) 32 ± 9 56 ± 15 t max ( h ) 6 . 0 ( 4 . 0 – 8 . 0 ) 3 . 0 ( 1 . 5 – 4 . 0 ) t ½ ( h ) 18 ± 4 16 ± 3 Figure 1 : Comparison of Pharmacokinetics : Guanfacine Extended - Release Tablets vs . Immediate - release guanfacine in Adults [ MULTIMEDIA ] Exposure to guanfacine was higher in children ( ages 6 to 12 ) compared to adolescents ( ages 13 to 17 ) and adults .
After oral administration of multiple doses of guanfacine extended - release tablets 4 mg , the C max was 10 ng / mL compared to 7 ng / mL and the AUC was 162 ng ∙ h / mL compared to 116 ng ∙ h / mL in children ( ages 6 to 12 ) and adolescents ( ages 13 to 17 ) , respectively .
These differences are probably attributable to the lower body weight of children compared to adolescents and adults .
The pharmacokinetics were affected by intake of food when a single dose of guanfacine extended - release tablets 4 mg was administered with a high - fat breakfast .
The mean exposure increased ( C max ~ 75 % and AUC ~ 40 % ) compared to dosing in a fasted state .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Dose Proportionality Following administration of guanfacine extended - release tablets in single doses of 1 mg , 2 mg , 3 mg , and 4 mg to adults , C max and AUC 0 - ∞ of guanfacine were proportional to dose .
Metabolism and Elimination In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP ' s demonstrated that guanfacine was primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 .
In pooled human hepatic microsomes , guanfacine did not inhibit the activities of the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes ( CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 / 5 ) ; guanfacine is also not an inducer of CYP3A , CYP1A2 and CYP2B6 .
Guanfacine is a substrate of CYP3A4 / 5 and exposure is affected by CYP3A4 / 5 inducers / inhibitors .
Guanfacine inhibits MATE1 and OCT1 , but does not inhibit BSEP , MRP2 , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OAT1 , OAT3 , OCT2 , or MATE2K .
Guanfacine is a substrate of OCT1 and OCT2 , but not BCRP , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OAT1 , OAT3 , MATE1 , or MATE2 .
Concomitant administration of guanfacine with OCT1 substrates might potentially increase the exposure of these OCT1 substrates .
Studies in Specific Populations Renal Impairment The impact of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of guanfacine in children was not assessed .
In adult patients with impaired renal function , the cumulative urinary excretion of guanfacine and the renal clearance diminished as renal function decreased .
In patients on hemodialysis , the dialysis clearance was about 15 % of the total clearance .
The low dialysis clearance suggests that the hepatic elimination ( metabolism ) increases as renal function decreases .
Hepatic Impairment The impact of hepatic impairment on PK of guanfacine in children was not assessed .
Guanfacine in adults is cleared both by the liver and the kidney , and approximately 50 % of the clearance of guanfacine is hepatic [ see Hepatic Impairment ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Drug Interaction Studies Guanfacine is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 and its plasma concentrations can be affected significantly by CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers ( Figure 2 ) .
Figure 2 : Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of Guanfacine Extended - Release Tablets [ MULTIMEDIA ] Guanfacine does not significantly affect exposures of methylphenidate and lisdexamfetamine when coadministered ( Figure 3 ) .
Figure 3 : Effect of Guanfacine Extended - Release Tablets on the Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of Other Drugs [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No carcinogenic effect of guanfacine was observed in studies of 78 weeks in mice or 102 weeks in rats at doses up to 6 . 8 times the maximum recommended human dose of 0 . 12 mg / kg / day on a mg / m 2 basis .
Mutagenesis Guanfacine was not genotoxic in a variety of test models , including the Ames test and an in vitro chromosomal aberration test ; however , a marginal increase in numerical aberrations ( polyploidy ) was observed in the latter study .
Impairment of Fertility No adverse effects were observed in fertility studies in male and female rats at doses up to 22 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg / m 2 basis .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Efficacy of guanfacine extended - release tablets in the treatment of ADHD was established in children and adolescents ( 6 to 17 years ) in : • Five short - term , placebo - controlled monotherapy trials ( Studies 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , and 6 ) .
• One short - term , placebo - controlled adjunctive trial with psychostimulants ( Study 3 ) .
• One long - term , placebo - controlled monotherapy maintenance trial ( Study 7 ) .
Studies 1 and 2 : Fixed - dose Guanfacine Extended - Release Tablets Monotherapy Study 1 ( 301 study ) was a double - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel - group , fixed - dose study , in which efficacy of once daily dosing with guanfacine extended - release tablets ( 2 mg , 3 mg and 4 mg ) was evaluated for 5 weeks ( n = 345 ) in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years .
Study 2 ( 304 study ) was a double - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel - group , fixed - dose study , in which efficacy of once daily dosing with guanfacine extended - release tablets ( 1 mg , 2 mg , 3 mg and 4 mg ) was evaluated for 6 weeks ( n = 324 ) in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years .
In both studies , randomized patients in 2 mg , 3 mg and 4 mg dose groups were titrated to their target fixed dose , and continued on the same dose until a dose tapering phase started .
The lowest dose of 1 mg used in Study 2 was not randomized to patients weighing more than 50 kg .
Patients who weighed less than 25 kg were not included in either study .
Signs and symptoms of ADHD were evaluated on a once weekly basis using the clinician administered and scored ADHD Rating Scale ( ADHD - RS - IV ) , which includes both hyperactive / impulsive and inattentive subscales .
The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline to endpoint in ADHD - RS - IV total scores .
Endpoint was defined as the last post - randomization treatment week for which a valid score was obtained prior to dose tapering ( up to Week 5 in Study 1 and up to Week 6 in Study 2 ) .
The mean reductions in ADHD - RS - IV total scores at endpoint were statistically significantly greater for guanfacine extended - release tablets compared to placebo for Studies 1 and 2 .
Placebo - adjusted changes from baseline were statistically significant for each of the 2 mg , 3 mg , and 4 mg guanfacine extended - release tablets randomized treatment groups in both studies , as well as the 1 mg guanfacine extended - release tablets treatment group that was included only in Study 2 ( see Table 16 ) .
Dose - responsive efficacy was evident , particularly when data were examined on a weight - adjusted ( mg / kg ) basis .
When evaluated over the dose range of 0 . 01 - 0 . 17 mg / kg / day , clinically relevant improvements were observed beginning at doses in the range 0 . 05 - 0 . 08 mg / kg / day .
Doses up to 0 . 12 mg / kg / day were shown to provide additional benefit .
In the monotherapy trials ( Studies 1 and 2 ) , subgroup analyses were performed to identify any differences in response based on gender or age ( 6 to 12 vs . 13 to 17 ) .
Analyses of the primary outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of gender .
Analyses by age revealed a statistically significant treatment effect only in the 6 to 12 age subgroup .
Due to the relatively small proportion of adolescent patients ( ages 13 to 17 ) enrolled into these studies ( approximately 25 % ) , these data may not have been sufficient to demonstrate efficacy in the adolescent patients .
In these studies , patients were randomized to a fixed dose of guanfacine extended - release tablets rather than optimized by body weight .
Therefore , some adolescent patients were randomized to a dose that might have resulted in relatively lower plasma guanfacine concentrations compared to the younger patients .
Over half ( 55 % ) of the adolescent patients received doses of 0 . 01 - 0 . 04 mg / kg .
In studies in which systematic pharmacokinetic data were obtained , there was a strong inverse correlation between body weight and plasma guanfacine concentrations .

Study 3 : Flexible - dose Guanfacine Extended - Release Tablets as Adjunctive Therapy to Psychostimulants Study 3 ( 313 study ) was a double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled , dose - optimization study , in which efficacy of once daily optimized dosing ( morning or evening ) with guanfacine extended - release tablets ( 1 mg , 2 mg , 3 mg and 4 mg ) , when co - administered with psychostimulants , was evaluated for 8 weeks , in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years with a diagnosis of ADHD , with a sub - optimal response to stimulants ( n = 455 ) .
Patients were started at the 1 mg guanfacine extended - release tablets dose level and were titrated weekly over a 5 - week dose - optimization period to an optimal guanfacine extended - release tablets dose not to exceed 4 mg / day based on tolerability and clinical response .
The dose was then maintained for a 3 - week dose maintenance period before entry to 1 week of dose tapering .
Patients took guanfacine extended - release tablets either in the morning or the evening while maintaining their current dose of psychostimulant treatment given each morning .
Allowable psychostimulants in the study were ADDERALL XR ® , VYVANSE ® , CONCERTA ® , FOCALIN XR ® , RITALIN LA ® , METADATE CD ® or FDA - approved generic equivalents .
Symptoms of ADHD were evaluated on a weekly basis by clinicians using the ADHD Rating Scale ( ADHD - RS - IV ) , which includes both hyperactive / impulsive and inattentive subscales .
The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline to endpoint in ADHD - RS - IV total scores .
Endpoint was defined as the last post - randomization treatment week prior to dose tapering for which a valid score was obtained ( up to Week 8 ) .
Mean reductions in ADHD - RS - IV total scores at endpoint were statistically significantly greater for guanfacine extended - release tablets given in combination with a psychostimulant compared to placebo given with a psychostimulant for Study 3 , for both morning and evening guanfacine extended - release tablets dosing ( see Table 17 ) .
Nearly two - thirds ( 64 . 2 % ) of patients reached optimal doses in the 0 . 05 - 0 . 12 mg / kg / day range .
Studies 4 , 5 and 6 : Flexible - dose Guanfacine Extended - Release Tablets Monotherapy Study 4 ( 314 study ) was a double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled , dose - optimization study , in which efficacy of once daily dosing ( morning or evening ) with guanfacine extended - release tablets ( 1 mg , 2 mg , 3 mg , and 4 mg ) was evaluated for 8 weeks in children aged 6 to 12 years ( n = 340 ) .
Signs and symptoms of ADHD were evaluated on a once weekly basis using the clinician administered and scored ADHD Rating Scale ( ADHD - RS - IV ) , which includes both hyperactive / impulsive and inattentive subscales .
The primary efficacy outcome was the change from baseline score at endpoint on the ADHD - RS - IV total scores .
Endpoint was defined as the last post - randomization treatment week for which a valid score was obtained prior to dose tapering ( up to Week 8 ) .
Mean reductions in ADHD - RS - IV total scores at endpoint were statistically significantly greater for guanfacine extended - release tablets compared to placebo in both AM and PM dosing groups of guanfacine extended - release tablets ( see Table 17 ) .
Study 5 ( 312 study ) was a 15 - week , double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled , dose - optimization study conducted in adolescents aged 13 to 17 years ( n = 314 ) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of guanfacine extended - release tablets ( 1 - 7 mg / day ; optimized dose range of 0 . 05 - 0 . 12 mg / kg / day ) in the treatment of ADHD as measured by the ADHD Rating Scale - IV ( ADHD - RS - IV ) .
Patients receiving guanfacine extended - release tablets showed statistically significantly greater improvement on the ADHD - RS - IV total score compared with patients receiving placebo ( see Table 17 ) .
Study 6 ( 316 study ) was a 12 - week ( for children aged 6 to 12 ) or 15 - week ( for adolescents aged 13 to 17 ) , randomized , double - blind , parallel - group , placebo - and active - reference , dose - optimization study conducted in pediatric patients ( children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years old inclusive ) ( n = 337 ) to assess the efficacy and safety of once - daily dosing ( children : 1 - 4 mg / day , adolescents : 1 - 7 mg / day ; optimized dose range of 0 . 05 to 0 . 12 mg / kg / day ) in the treatment of ADHD .
Guanfacine extended - release tablets were statistically superior to placebo on symptoms of ADHD in patients 6 to 17 years as measured by change from baseline in ADHD - RS - IV total scores ( see Table 17 ) .

Study 7 : Long - Term Maintenance of Guanfacine Extended - Release Tablets Efficacy Study 7 ( 315 study ) was a double - blind , placebo - controlled , randomized withdrawal trial in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years with DSM - IV - TR diagnosis of ADHD .
The study consisted of an open - label phase , including a 7 - week dose optimization period to titrate patients to an optimal dose ( maximum 4 mg / day for children and 7 mg / day for adolescents ; optimized dose range : 0 . 05 to 0 . 12 mg / kg / day ) and a 6 - week dose maintenance period .
There were 526 patients included in the open - label phase .
Among those , 315 patients who met response criteria in the open - label phase were then randomized ( 1 : 1 , guanfacine extended - release tablets : placebo ) in a 26 - week , double - blind , randomized withdrawal phase .
The response criteria were defined by ≥ 30 % reduction in ADHD - RS - IV total score and a Clinical Global Impression - Improvement ( CGI - I ) score of 1 or 2 during the open - label phase .
A statistically significantly lower proportion of treatment failures occurred among guanfacine extended - release tablets patients compared to placebo at the end of the randomized withdrawal period ( Figure 4 ) .
Treatment failure was defined as a ≥ 50 % increase ( worsening ) in ADHD - RS - IV total score and a ≥ 2 - point increase in Clinical Global Impression - Severity ( CGI - S ) score .
