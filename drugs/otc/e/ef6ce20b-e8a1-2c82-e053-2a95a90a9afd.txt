Each patient received a single gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET / CT or PET / MR from mid - thigh to skull base .
A total of 123 patients ( 38 % ) proceeded to standard - of - care prostatectomy and template pelvic lymph node dissection and had sufficient histopathology data for evaluation ( evaluable patients ) .
Three members of a pool of six central readers independently interpreted each PET scan for the presence of abnormal gallium Ga 68 gozetotide uptake in pelvic lymph nodes located in the common iliac , external iliac , internal iliac , and obturator subregions bilaterally as well as in any other pelvic location .
The readers were blinded to all clinical information except for the history of prostate cancer prior to definitive treatment .
Extrapelvic sites and the prostate gland itself were not analyzed in this study .
For each patient , gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET results and reference standard histopathology obtained from dissected pelvic lymph nodes were compared by region ( left hemipelvis , right hemipelvis , and other ) .
For the 123 evaluable patients , the mean age was 65 years ( range 45 to 76 years ) , and 89 % were white .
The median serum PSA was 11 . 8 ng / mL .
The summed Gleason score was 7 for 44 % , 8 for 20 % , and 9 for 31 % of the patients , with the remainder of the patients having Gleason scores of 6 or 10 .
Table 6 compares majority PET reads to pelvic lymph node histopathology results at the patient - level with region matching , such that at least one true positive region defines a true positive patient .
As shown , approximately 24 % of subjects studied were found to have pelvic nodal metastases based on histopathology ( 95 % confidence interval : 17 % , 32 % ) .

In an exploratory subgroup analysis based on summed Gleason score , there was a numerical trend toward more true positives in patients with Gleason score of 8 or higher compared to those with Gleason score of 7 or lower .
An exploratory analysis was performed to estimate the sensitivity and specificity for pelvic nodal metastasis detection in all scanned patients , including the patients who were lacking histopathology reference standard .
An imputation method was used based on patient - specific factors .
This exploratory analysis resulted in an imputed sensitivity of 47 % , with a 95 % confidence interval ranging from 38 % to 55 % , and an imputed specificity of 74 % , with a 95 % confidence interval ranging from 68 % to 80 % for all patients imaged with gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET .
PSMA - BCR This two - center study enrolled 635 patients with biochemical evidence of recurrent prostate cancer after definitive therapy , defined by serum PSA of > 0 . 2 ng / mL more than 6 weeks after prostatectomy or by an increase in serum PSA of at least 2 ng / mL above nadir after definitive radiotherapy .
All patients received a single gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET / CT or PET / MR from mid - thigh to skull base .
Three members of a pool of nine independent central readers evaluated each scan for the presence and regional location ( 20 subregions grouped into four regions ) of abnormal gallium Ga 68 gozetotide uptake suggestive of recurrent prostate cancer .
The readers were blinded to all clinical information other than type of primary therapy and most recent serum PSA level .
A total of 469 patients ( 74 % ) had at least one positive region detected by gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET majority read .
The distribution of gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET positive regions was 34 % bone , 25 % prostate bed , 25 % pelvic lymph node , and 17 % extrapelvic soft tissue .
Two hundred and ten patients had composite reference standard information collected in a PET positive region ( evaluable patients ) , consisting of at least one of the following : histopathology , imaging ( bone scintigraphy , CT , or MRI ) acquired at baseline or within 12 months after gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET , or serial serum PSA .
Composite reference standard information for gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET negative regions was not systematically collected in this study .
In the 210 evaluable patients , the mean age was 70 years ( range 49 to 88 years ) and 82 % were 65 years of age or older .
White patients made up 90 % of the group .
The median serum PSA was 3 . 6 ng / mL .
Prior treatment included radical prostatectomy in 64 % and radiotherapy in 73 % .
Of the 210 evaluable patients , 192 patients ( 91 % ) were found to be true positive in one or more regions against the composite reference standard ( 95 % confidence interval : 88 % , 95 % ) .
Among the pool of nine readers used in the study , the proportion of patients who were true positive in one or more regions ranged from 82 % to 97 % .
The prostate bed had the lowest proportion of true positive results at the region - level ( 76 % versus 96 % for non - prostate regions ) .
An exploratory analysis was also performed in which gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET positive patients who lacked reference standard information were imputed using an estimated likelihood that at least one location - matched PET positive lesion was reference standard positive based on patient - specific factors .
In this exploratory analysis , 340 of 475 patients ( 72 % ) were imputed as true positive in one or more regions ( 95 % confidence interval : 68 % , 76 % ) .
In another exploratory analysis using the same imputation approach for PET positive patients who lacked reference standard information , 340 of 635 patients ( 54 % ) were correctly detected as true positive ( 95 % confidence interval : 50 % , 57 % ) among all BCR patients who received a PET scan , whether it was read as positive or negative .
The likelihood of identifying a gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET positive lesion in this study generally increased with higher serum PSA level .
Table 7 shows the patient - level gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET results stratified by serum PSA level .
The mean time between PSA measurement and PET scan was 40 days with a range of 0 to 367 days .
Percent PET positivity was calculated as the proportion of patients with a positive gallium Ga 68 gozetotide PET out of all patients scanned .
Percent PET positivity includes patients determined to be either true positive or false positive as well as those in whom such determination was not made due to the absence of composite reference standard data .
