Caution : Do not eat or drink dairy products within one hour of fluoride administration .
Incompatibility of fluoride with dairy foods has been reported due to formation of calcium fluoride which is poorly absorbed .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Sodium Fluoride acts systemically ( before tooth eruption ) and topically ( post - eruption ) by increasing tooth resistance to acid dissolution , by promoting remineralization , and by inhibiting the cariogenic microbial process .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE For once daily self - applied systemic use as a dental caries preventive in pediatric patients .
It has been established that ingestion of fluoridated drinking water ( 1 ppm F ¯ ) during the period of tooth development results in a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries .
Sodium Fluoride Chewable Tablets were developed to provide systemic fluoride for use as a supplement in pediatric patients from age 3 years to age 16 years and older living in areas where the drinking water fluoride contents does not exceed 0 . 6 ppm F ¯ .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Fluoride 1 . 0 mg Tablets are contraindicated when the fluoride content of drinking water is > 0 . 3 ppm F ¯ and should not be administered to pediatric patients under 6 years .
Fluoride 0 . 5 mg Tablets are contraindicated when the fluoride content of drinking water is more than 0 . 6 ppm F ¯ and should not be administered to pediatric patients under age 6 when the fluoride content of drinking water is 0 . 3 ppm F ¯ or more or to pediatric patients under age 3 years .
Fluoride 0 . 25 mg Tablets are contraindicated when the fluoride content of drinking water is more than 0 . 6 ppm F ¯ and should not be administered to pediatric patients under age 3 years when the fluoride content of drinking water is 0 . 3 ppm F ¯ or more .
Do not administer Sodium Fluoride Chewable Tablets ( any strength ) to pediatric patients under age 3 years .
Sodium Fluoride Chewable Tablets ( any strength ) are not indicated for use in adults .
OVERDOSAGE Prolonged daily ingestion of excessive fluoride will result in varying degrees of fluorosis .
Accidental ingestion of large amounts of fluoride may result in acute burning in the mouth and sore tongue .
Nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea may occur soon after ingestion ( within 30 minutes ) and are accompanied by salivation , hematemesis , and epigastric cramping abdominal pain .
These symptoms may persist for 24 hours .
If less than 5 mg fluoride / kg body weight ( i . e . , less than 2 . 3 mg fluoride / lb body weight ) have been ingested , give calcium ( e . g . , milk ) orally to relieve gastrointestinal symptoms and observe for a few hours .
If more than 5 mg fluoride / kg body weight ( i . e . , more than 2 . 3 mg fluoride / lb body weight ) have been ingested , induce vomiting , give orally soluble calcium ( e . g . , milk , 5 % calcium gluconate or calcium lactate solution ) and immediately seek medical assistance .
For accidental ingestion of more than 15 mg fluoride / kg body weight ( i . e . , more than 6 . 9 mg fluoride / lb body weight ) , induce vomiting and admit immediately to a hospital facility .
A treatment dose of Sodium Fluoride Chewable Tablets contains 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 or 1 . 0 mg fluoride .
The treatment of choice depends upon the age of the child and the water fluoride content .
A bottle of 120 0 . 25 mg tablets contains 30 mg fluoride .
A bottle of 120 0 . 5 mg tablets contains 60 mg fluoride .
A bottle of 120 1 . 0 mg tablets contains 120 mg fluoride .
[ The total amount of sodium fluoride in a bottle of 120 Fluoride Chewable Tablets ( all strengths ) conforms with the recommended amount of the American Dental Association for the maximum to be dispensed at one time for safety purposes . ]
WARNING Prolonged daily ingestion of quantities greater than the recommended amount may result in various degrees of dental fluorosis in pediatric patients under age 6 years , especially if the water fluoridation exceeds 0 . 6 ppm .
Read directions carefully before using .
This product , as all chewable tablets , is not recommended for children under age 3 due to risk of choking .
Keep out of the reach of infants and children .
PRECAUTIONS General Please refer to the CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGSand OVERDOSAGEsections for overdosage concerns .
Use in pediatric patients below the age of 3 years is not recommended by current American Dental Associations and American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a study conducted in rodents , no carcinogenesis was found in male and female rats treated with fluoride at dose levels ranging from 4 . 1 to 9 . 1 mg / kg of body weight .
Equivocal evidence of carcinogenesis was reported for male rats treated with 2 . 5 and 4 . 1 mg / kg of body weight .
In a second study , no carcinogenesis was observed in rats , males or females , treated with fluoride up to 11 . 3 mg / kg of body weight .
This dose is at least 400 times greater than the recommended daily dose of Sodium Fluoride Chewable Tablets .
Fluoride ion is not mutagenic in standard bacterial systems .
It has been shown that fluoride ion has potential to induce chromosome aberrations in cultured human and rodentcells at does much higher than those to which humans are exposed .
In vivo data is conflicting .
Some studies report chromosome damage in rodents while other studies using similar protocols report negative results .
Potential adverse reproductive effects of fluoride exposure in humans has not been adequately evaluated .
Adverse effects on reproduction were reported for rats , mice , fox , and cattle exposed to 100 ppm or greater concentrations of fluoride in their diet or drinking water .
Other studies conducted in rats demonstrated that lower doses of fluoride ( 5 mg / kg of body weight ) did not result in impaired fertility and reproductive capabilities .
This dose is approximately 200 times greater than the recommended daily dose of Sodium Fluoride Chewable Tablets .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B It has been shown that fluoride crosses the placenta of rats , but only 0 . 01 % of the amount administered is incorporated in fetal tissue .
Animal studies ( rats , mice , rabbits ) have shown that fluoride is not a teratogen .
Maternal exposure to 12 . 2 mg fluoride / kg of body weight ( rats ) or 13 . 1 mg / kg of body weight ( rabbits ) did not affect the litter size or fetal weight and did not increase the frequency of skeletal or visceral malformations .
Epidemiological studies conducted in areas with high levels of naturally fluoridated water showed no increase in birth defects .
Heavy exposure to fluoride during in utero development may result in skeletal fluorosis which becomes evident in childhood .
Nursing Mothers It is not known if fluoride is excreted in human milk .
However , many drugs are excreted in human milk and caution should be exercised when Sodium Fluoride Chewable Tablets are administered to a nursing woman .
Reduced milk production was reported in farm raised fox when the animals were fed a diet containing a high concentration of fluoride ( 98 - 137 mg / kg of body weight ) .
No adverse effects on parturition , lactation , or offspring were seen in rats administered fluoride up to 5 mg / kg of body weight .
This dose is at least 200 times greater than the recommended daily dose of Sodium Fluoride Chewable Tablets .
Geriatric Use Sodium Fluoride Chewable Tablets ( any strength ) are not indicated for use in geriatric patients .
Pediatric Use The use of Sodium Fluoride Chewable Tablets as a caries preventive in pediatric age groups 3 years to 16 years is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies on fluoride supplementation from birth through adolescence .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Allergic rash and other idiosyncrasies have been rarely reported .
