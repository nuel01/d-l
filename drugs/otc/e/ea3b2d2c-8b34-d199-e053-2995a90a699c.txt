11 DESCRIPTION IHEEZO TM is a sterile , single - patient ‑ use ophthalmic gel preparation for topical ocular anesthesia containing chloroprocaine hydrochloride as the active pharmaceutical ingredient .
Chloroprocaine hydrochloride is an ester anesthetic .
It is a water - soluble white crystalline powder and its chemical name is 2 - ( Diethylamino ) ethyl 4 ‑ amino - 2 - chlorobenzoate monohydrochloride .
The molecular weight is 307 . 22 and the molecular formula is C 13 H 19 ClN 2 O 2 · HCl .
It is represented by the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] IHEEZO TM contains : Active : 30 mg of chloroprocaine hydrochloride ( equivalent to 26 mg of chloroprocaine ) per gram of gel .
Inactive ingredients : Hydroxyethyl Cellulose ( HEC ) , and Water for Injection .
The pH may be adjusted to 3 . 0 to 5 . 0 with Hydrochloric Acid .
This product does not contain an antimicrobial preservative .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Chloroprocaine , like other local anesthetics , blocks the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses , presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve , by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse , and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential .
In general , the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter , myelination , and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers .
Clinically , the order of loss of nerve function is as follows : ( 1 ) pain , ( 2 ) temperature , ( 3 ) touch , ( 4 ) proprioception , and ( 5 ) skeletal muscle tone .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The systemic exposure to chloroprocaine following topical ocular administration of IHEEZO TM has not been studied .
Elimination Metabolism Chloroprocaine is metabolized by plasma pseudocholinesterases and nonspecific esterases in ocular tissues .
Chloroprocaine is rapidly metabolized in plasma by hydrolysis of the ester linkage by pseudocholinesterase .
The hydrolysis of chloroprocaine results in the production of ß - diethylaminoethanol and 2 - chloro - 4 - aminobenzoic acid , which inhibits the action of the sulfonamides .
Excretion Chloroprocaine plasma half - life in vitro is approximately 25 seconds in adults and approximately 43 seconds in neonates .
The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anesthetics and their metabolites .
Urinary excretion is affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary pH . 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long - term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of chloroprocaine have not been conducted .
Mutagenesis 2 - chloroprocaine and the main metabolite , ACBA , were negative in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation test ( Ames assay ) and the in vitro chromosome aberrations assay .
Impairment of Fertility Studies in animals to evaluate the impairment of fertility have not been conducted with chloroprocaine .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Study 1 and 2 Study 1 ( NCT04779606 ) and Study 2 ( NCT04753710 ) were randomized , double - blinded placebo - controlled studies conducted to evaluate the efficacy , safety , and local tolerability of IHEEZO TM in 145 healthy volunteers .
In Study 1 , 85 healthy male and female were randomized in a 4 : 1 ratio to receive a single ocular instillation of IHEEZO TM ( N = 68 ) or placebo ( N = 17 ) .
The double blinded treatment included a IHEEZO TM or a placebo dose of 3 drops instilled at 1 minute ± 15 seconds intervals in the right eye of each volunteer .
The median age was 39 years ( range 19 to 55 years ) ; 59 % female and 41 % male .
In Study 2 , 60 healthy male and female were randomized ( 40 : 20 ) to receive single or multiple ocular instillations of IHEEZO TM dose of 3 drops in the right eye .
The median age was 25 years ( range 18 to 59 years ) ; 54 % female ad 46 % male .
The efficacy in Study 1 and 2 was determined by proportion of patients achieving full conjunctival anesthesia evaluated by conjunctival pinching , 5 minutes after administration .
Efficacy results of Study 1 The proportion of subjects with successful anesthesia was 90 % in IHEEZO TM group and 12 % in the placebo group ( p < 0 . 01 ) .
The median time for the IHEEZO TM group achieving anesthesia was 0 . 67 minutes .
The median duration of anesthesia was 14 . 3 minutes .
Efficacy results of Study 2 The proportion of subjects with successful anesthesia was 95 % in the IHEEZO TM group and 20 % in the placebo group ( p < 0 . 01 ) .
The median time for the IHEEZO TM group achieving anesthesia was 0 . 67 minutes .
The median duration of anesthesia was 19 . 3 minutes .
14 . 2 Study 3 Study 3 ( NCT04685538 ) was a randomized , prospective , multi - center , active - controlled , observer - masked study conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IHEEZO TM ( N = 166 ) versus tetracaine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % ( N = 172 ) in patients undergoing cataract surgery .
The primary endpoint was defined as the proportion of patients in each treatment group gaining successful anesthesia without any supplementation .
On average , patients needed 1 - 1 . 5 minutes to obtain sufficient anesthesia to successfully perform the surgical procedure which lasted on average 22 minutes .
No patient treated with IHEEZO TM required supplemental treatment to complete the intended surgical procedure .
