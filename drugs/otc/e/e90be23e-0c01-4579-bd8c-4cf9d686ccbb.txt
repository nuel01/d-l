4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection is contraindicated in patients with : • known hypersensitivity to potassium chloride and / or dextrose [ see Warnings and Precautions 5 . 1 ) ] • clinically significant hyperkalemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • clinically significant hyperglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • known hypersensitivity to potassium chloride and / or dextrose ( 5 . 1 ) • clinically significant hyperkalemia ( 5 . 2 ) • clinically significant hyperglycemia ( 5 . 3 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypersensitivity Reactions : monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue infusion if reactions occur .
( 5 . 1 ) • Hyperkalemia : May result in cardiac arrhythmias .
Avoid use in patients with , or at risk for , hyperkalemia .
If use cannot be avoided , use a product with a low amount of potassium chloride , infuse slowly and monitor serum potassium concentrations and ECGs .
( 5 . 2 ) • Hyperglycemia or Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State : Monitor blood glucose and administer insulin as needed .
( 5 . 3 , 8 . 4 ) • Hyponatremia : Avoid in patients with or at risk for hyponatremia .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor serum sodium concentrations .
( 5 . 4 , 8 . 4 ) • Hypokalemia : Avoid in patients with or at risk for hypokalemia .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor serum potassium levels .
( 5 . 5 ) • Fluid Overload : Avoid in patients with or at risk for fluid and / or solute overloading .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor daily fluid balance and electrolyte , concentrations and acid - base balance , as needed and especially during prolonged use .
( 5 . 6 ) • Refeeding Syndrome : Monitor severely undernourished patients and slowly increase nutrient intake .
( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity and infusion reactions , including anaphylaxis , have been reported with Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Stop the infusion immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity or infusion reaction develops [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Appropriate therapeutic countermeasures must be instituted as clinically indicated .
5 . 2 Hyperkalemia Potassium - containing solutions , including Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection may increase the risk of hyperkalemia .
Hyperkalemia can be asymptomatic and manifest only by increased serum potassium concentrations and / or characteristic electrocardiographic ( ECG ) changes .
Cardiac arrhythmias , some fatal , can develop at any time during hyperkalemia .
To avoid life threatening hyperkalemia , do not administer Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection as an intravenous push ( i . e . , intravenous injection manually with a syringe connected to the intravenous access , without quantitative infusion device [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Patients at increased risk of developing hyperkalemia and cardiac arrhythmias include those : • with severe renal impairment , acute dehydration , extensive tissue injury or burns , and certain cardiac disorders such as congestive heart failure or AV block ( especially if they receive digoxin ) .
• with hyperosmolality , acidosis , or undergoing correction of alkalsis ( conditions associated with a shift of potassium from intracellular to extracellular space ) .
• treated concurrently or recently with agents or products that can cause or increase the risk of hyperkalemia [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Avoid use of Potassium Chloride in 5 % Dextrose Injection in patients with , or at risk for , hyperkalemia .
If use cannot be avoided , use a product with a low amount of potassium chloride , infuse slowly and monitor serum potassium concentrations and ECGs .
5 . 3 Hyperglycemia and Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State The use of dextrose infusions in patients with impaired glucose tolerance ( such as diabetes mellitus , renal impairment , or in the presence of sepsis , trauma , or shock ) may worsen hyperglycemia .
Administration of dextrose at a rate exceeding the patient ’ s utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia , coma , and death .
Hyperglycemia is associated with an increase in serum osmolality , resulting in osmotic diuresis , dehydration and electrolyte losses [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
Patients with underlying central nervous system disease and renal impairment who receive dextrose infusions , may be at greater risk of developing hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state .
Monitor blood glucose concentrations and treat hyperglycemia to maintain concentrations within normal limits while administering Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection .
Insulin may be administered or adjusted to maintain optimal blood glucose concentrations .
5 . 4 Hyponatremia Potassium Chloride in 5 % Dextrose Injection is an isotonic solution [ see Description , Table 1 ( 11 ) ] .
In the body , however , glucose containing fluids can become extremely physiologically hypotonic due to rapid glucose metabolization .
Monitoring of serum sodium is particularly important for hypotonic fluids .
Depending on the tonicity of the solution , the volume and rate of infusion , and depending on a patient ’ s underlying clinical condition and capability to metabolize glucose , intravenous administration of glucose can cause electrolyte disturbances , most importantly hypo - or hyperosmotic hyponatremia .
The risk for hyponatremia is increased , in pediatric patients , elderly patients , postoperative patients , those with psychogenic polydipsia and in patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia ( such as certain diuretic , antiepileptic and psychotropic medications ) .
Close clinical monitoring may be warranted .
Acute hyponatremia can lead to acute hyponatremic encephalopathy characterized by headache , nausea , seizures , lethargy and vomiting .
Patients with brain edema are at particular risk of severe , irreversible and life - threatening brain injury .
Patients at increased risk for developing complications of hyponatremia , such as hyponatremic encephalopathy include pediatric patients ; women , in particular , premenopausal women ; patients with hypoxemia ; and in patients with underlying central nervous system disease [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 , 8 . 5 ) ] .
Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome with risk of seizures and cerebral edema .
To avoid complications , monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations , fluid status , acid - base balance , and signs of neurologic complications .
High volume infusion must be used with close monitoring in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure , and in patients with non - osmotic vasopressin release ( including SIADH ) , due to the risk of hospital - acquired hyponatremia .
5 . 5 Hypokalemia The infusion of solutions with Potassium Chloride in 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP may result in hypokalemia , leading to arrhythmias , muscle weakness , paralysis , heart block , and rhabdomyolysis .
Hypokalemic periodic paralysis , metabolic alkalosis , increased gastrointestinal losses ( e . g . , diarrhea , vomiting ) , prolonged low potassium diet or primary hyperaldosteronism may increase the risk of hypokalemia .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor serum potassium levels .
5 . 6 Fluid Overload Depending on the volume and rate of infusion , the patient ’ s underlying clinical condition and capability to metabolize dextrose , intravenous administration of Potassium Chloride in 5 % Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection can cause fluid and / or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
Avoid Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection in patients with or at risk for fluid and / or solute overloading .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor fluid balance , electrolyte concentrations , and acid - base balance as needed and especially during prolonged use .
5 . 7 Refeeding syndrome Refeeding severely undernourished patients may result in the refeeding syndrome that is characterized by the shift of potassium , phosphorus , and magnesium intracellularly as the patient becomes anabolic .
Thiamine deficiency and fluid retention may also develop .
To prevent these complications , monitor severely undernourished patients and slowly increasing nutrient intake .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection were identified in post marketing reports .
Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • Hypersensitivity reactions : including anaphylaxis and chills [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Hyperkalemia , including cardiac arrest , as a manifestation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Hyponatremia and hyponatremic encephalopathy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Hypokalemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Hypervolemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Injection site reactions : infection at the site of injection , venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection , extravasation , infusion site rash , infusion site pain , infusion site vesicles , infusion site pruritus , pyrexia and chills Adverse reactions include electrolyte imbalances , hyperglycemia , and hypervolemia and injection site reactions .
