( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Diarrhea , Nausea , and Vomiting : Consider apremilast dose reduction or suspension if patients develop severe diarrhea , nausea , or vomiting .
( 5 . 1 ) • Depression : Advise patients , their caregivers , and families to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression , suicidal thoughts or other mood changes and if such changes occur to contact their healthcare provider .
Carefully weigh risks and benefits of treatment with apremilast in patients with a history of depression and / or suicidal thoughts or behavior .
( 5 . 2 ) • Weight Decrease : Monitor weight regularly .
If unexplained or clinically significant weight loss occurs , evaluate weight loss and consider discontinuation of apremilast .
( 5 . 3 ) • Drug Interactions : Use with strong cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers ( e . g . , rifampin , phenobarbital , carbamazepine , phenytoin ) is not recommended because loss of efficacy may occur .
( 5 . 4 , 7 . 1 ) 5 . 1 Diarrhea , Nausea , and Vomiting There have been postmarketing reports of severe diarrhea , nausea , and vomiting associated with the use of apremilast .
Most events occurred within the first few weeks of treatment .
In some cases , patients were hospitalized .
Patients 65 years of age or older and patients taking medications that can lead to volume depletion or hypotension may be at a higher risk of complications from severe diarrhea , nausea , or vomiting .
Monitor patients who are more susceptible to complications of diarrhea or vomiting .
Patients who reduced dosage or discontinued apremilast generally improved quickly .
Consider apremilast dose reduction or suspension if patients develop severe diarrhea , nausea , or vomiting .
5 . 2 Depression Treatment with apremilast is associated with an increase in adverse reactions of depression .
Before using apremilast in patients with a history of depression and / or suicidal thoughts or behavior prescribers should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with apremilast in such patients .
Patients , their caregivers , and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression , suicidal thoughts or other mood changes , and if such changes occur to contact their healthcare provider .
Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with apremilast if such events occur .
Psoriasis : During the 0 to 16 week placebo - controlled period of the 3 controlled clinical trials , 1 . 3 % ( 12 / 920 ) of subjects treated with apremilast reported depression compared to 0 . 4 % ( 2 / 506 ) treated with placebo .
During the clinical trials , 0 . 1 % ( 1 / 1 , 308 ) of subjects treated with apremilast discontinued treatment due to depression compared with none in placebo - treated subjects ( 0 / 506 ) .
Depression was reported as serious in 0 . 1 % ( 1 / 1 , 308 ) of subjects exposed to apremilast , compared to none in placebo - treated subjects ( 0 / 506 ) .
Instances of suicidal behavior have been observed in 0 . 1 % ( 1 / 1 , 308 ) of subjects while receiving apremilast , compared to 0 . 2 % ( 1 / 506 ) in placebo - treated subjects .
In the clinical trials , one subject treated with apremilast attempted suicide while one who received placebo committed suicide .
5 . 3 Weight Decrease During the controlled period of the trials in psoriasis , weight decrease between 5 % to 10 % of body weight occurred in 12 % ( 96 / 784 ) of subjects treated with apremilast compared to 5 % ( 19 / 382 ) treated with placebo .
Weight decrease of ≥ 10 % of body weight occurred in 2 % ( 16 / 784 ) of subjects treated with apremilast 30 mg twice daily compared to 1 % ( 3 / 382 ) subjects treated with placebo .
Patients treated with apremilast should have their weight monitored regularly .
If unexplained or clinically significant weight loss occurs , weight loss should be evaluated , and discontinuation of apremilast should be considered [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 4 Drug Interactions Co - administration of strong cytochrome P450 enzyme inducer , rifampin , resulted in a reduction of systemic exposure of apremilast , which may result in a loss of efficacy of apremilast .
Therefore , the use of cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers ( e . g . , rifampin , phenobarbital , carbamazepine , phenytoin ) with apremilast is not recommended [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
Psoriasis Clinical Trials The safety of apremilast was assessed in 1 , 426 subjects in 3 randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials in adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy .
Subjects were randomized to receive apremilast 30 mg twice daily or placebo twice daily .
Titration was used over the first 5 days [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Subjects ranged in age from 18 to 83 years , with an overall median age of 46 years .
Diarrhea , nausea , and upper respiratory tract infection were the most commonly reported adverse reactions .
The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation for subjects taking apremilast were nausea ( 1 . 6 % ) , diarrhea ( 1 . 0 % ) , and headache ( 0 . 8 % ) .
The proportion of subjects with psoriasis who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reaction was 6 . 1 % for subjects treated with apremilast 30 mg twice daily and 4 . 1 % for placebo - treated subjects .

Severe worsening of psoriasis ( rebound ) occurred in 0 . 3 % ( 4 / 1 , 184 ) subjects following discontinuation of treatment with apremilast .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Strong CYP450 Inducers Apremilast exposure is decreased when apremilast is co - administered with strong CYP450 inducers ( such as rifampin ) and may result in loss of efficacy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Severe Renal Impairment : Increased systemic exposure of apremilast has been observed , reduction in dose to 30 mg once daily is recommended .
( 2 . 2 , 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to apremilast during pregnancy .
Information about the registry can be obtained by calling 1 - 877 - 311 - 8972 .
Risk Summary Available pharmacovigilance data with apremilast use in pregnant women have not established a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes , but these data are extremely limited .
Based on findings from animal reproduction studies , apremilast may increase the risk for fetal loss .
In animal embryo - fetal development studies , the administration of apremilast to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during organogenesis resulted in dose - related increases in abortion / embryo - fetal death at dose exposures 2 . 1 - times the maximum recommended human therapeutic dose ( MRHD ) and no adverse effect at an exposure of 1 . 4 - times the MRHD .
When administered to pregnant mice , during organogenesis there were no apremilast - induced malformations up to exposures 4 . 0 - times the MRHD ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk of fetal loss .
Consider pregnancy planning and prevention for females of reproductive potential .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In an embryo - fetal developmental study , pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered apremilast at doses of 20 , 50 , 200 , or 1 , 000 mg / kg / day during the period of organogenesis ( gestation Days 20 through 50 ) .
There was a dose - related increase in spontaneous abortions , with most abortions occurring during Weeks 3 to 4 of dosing in the first trimester , at doses approximately 2 . 1 - times the MRHD and greater ( on an area under the curve [ AUC ] basis at doses ≥ 50 mg / kg / day ) .
No abortifacient effects were observed at a dose approximately 1 . 4 - times the MRHD ( on an AUC basis at a dose of 20 mg / kg / day ) .
Although , there was no evidence for a teratogenic effect at doses of 20 mg / kg / day and greater when examined at day 100 , aborted fetuses were not examined .
In an embryo - fetal development study in mice , apremilast was administered at doses of 250 , 500 , or 750 mg / kg / day to dams during organogenesis ( gestation Day 6 through 15 ) .
In a combined fertility and embryo - fetal development study in mice , apremilast was administered at doses of 10 , 20 , 40 , or 80 mg / kg / day starting 15 days before cohabitation and continuing through gestation Day 15 .
No teratogenic findings attributed to apremilast were observed in either study ; however , there was an increase in postimplantation loss at doses corresponding to a systemic exposure of 2 . 3 - times the MRHD and greater ( ≥ 20 mg / kg / day ) .
At doses of ≥ 20 mg / kg / day skeletal variations included incomplete ossification sites of tarsals , skull , sternebra , and vertebrae .
No effects were observed at a dose approximately 1 . 3 - times the MRHD ( 10 mg / kg / day ) .
Apremilast distributed across the placenta into the fetal compartment in mice and monkeys .
In a pre - and postnatal study in mice , apremilast was administered to pregnant female mice at doses of 10 , 80 , or 300 mg / kg / day from Day 6 of gestation through Day 20 of lactation , with weaning on Day 21 .
Dystocia , reduced viability , and reduced birth weights occurred at doses corresponding to ≥ 4 . 0 - times the MRHD ( on an AUC basis at doses ≥ 80 mg / kg / day ) .
No adverse effects occurred at a dose 1 . 3 - times the MRHD ( 10 mg / kg / day ) .
There was no evidence for functional impairment of physical development , behavior , learning ability , immune competence , or fertility in the offspring at doses up to 7 . 5 - times the MRHD ( on an AUC basis at a dose of 300 mg / kg / day ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of apremilast in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
However , apremilast was detected in the milk of lactating mice .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for apremilast and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from apremilast or from the underlying maternal condition .
Data In mice , following a single oral administration of 10 mg / kg to dams on postpartum day 13 , apremilast concentrations in milk were approximately 1 . 5 - times that of simultaneously collected blood samples .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of apremilast in pediatric patients less than18 years of age have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 1 , 257 subjects who enrolled in two placebo - controlled psoriasis trials ( PSOR 1 and PSOR 2 ) , a total of 108 psoriasis subjects were 65 years of age and older , including 9 subjects who were 75 years of age and older .
No overall differences were observed in the efficacy and safety in elderly subjects ≥ 65 years of age and younger adult subjects < 65 years of age in the clinical trials .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Apremilast pharmacokinetics were characterized in subjects with mild , moderate , and severe renal impairment as defined by a creatinine clearance of 60 to 89 , 30 to 59 , and less than 30 mL per minute , respectively , by the Cockcroft – Gault equation .
While no dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment , the dose of apremilast should be reduced to 30 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Apremilast pharmacokinetics were characterized in subjects with moderate ( Child Pugh B ) and severe ( Child Pugh C ) hepatic impairment .
No dose adjustment is necessary in these patients .
10 OVERDOSAGE In case of overdose , patients should seek immediate medical help .
Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care should there be an overdose .
11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in apremilast tablets is apremilast .
Apremilast is a phosphodiesterase 4 ( PDE4 ) inhibitor .
Apremilast is known chemically as N - [ 2 - [ ( 1 S ) - 1 - ( 3 - ethoxy - 4 - methoxyphenyl ) - 2 - ( methylsulfonyl ) ethyl ] - 2 , 3 - dihydro - 1 , 3 - dioxo - 1 H - isoindol - 4 - yl ] acetamide .
Its molecular formula is C22H24N2O7S and the molecular weight is 460 . 50 g / mol .
The chemical structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Apremilast is a white to pale yellow powder .
It is soluble in acetone and practically insoluble in water .
Apremilast tablets are supplied in 10 mg , 20 mg , and 30 mg strengths for oral administration .
Each tablet contains apremilast as the active ingredient and the following inactive ingredients : croscarmellose sodium , ferrosoferric oxide ( 30 mg ) , iron oxide red , iron oxide yellow ( 20 mg and 30 mg ) , lactose monohydrate , magnesium stearate , polyethylene glycol , polyvinyl alcohol , talc and titanium dioxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Apremilast is an oral small - molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 ( PDE4 ) specific for cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) .
PDE4 inhibition results in increased intracellular cAMP levels .
The specific mechanism ( s ) by which apremilast exerts its therapeutic action is not well defined .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Apremilast when taken orally is absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of ~ 73 % , with peak plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) occurring at a median time ( tmax ) of ~ 2 . 5 hours .
Co - administration with food does not alter the extent of absorption of apremilast .
Distribution Human plasma protein binding of apremilast is approximately 68 % .
Mean apparent volume of distribution ( Vd ) is 87 L . Metabolism Following oral administration in humans , apremilast is a major circulating component ( 45 % ) followed by inactive metabolite M12 ( 39 % ) , a glucuronide conjugate of O - demethylated apremilast .
It is extensively metabolized in humans with up to 23 metabolites identified in plasma , urine and feces .
Apremilast is metabolized by both cytochrome ( CYP ) oxidative metabolism with subsequent glucuronidation and non - CYP mediated hydrolysis .
In vitro , CYP metabolism of apremilast is primarily mediated by CYP3A4 , with minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 .
Elimination The plasma clearance of apremilast is about 10 L / hr in healthy subjects , with a terminal elimination half - life of approximately 6 to 9 hours .
Following oral administration of radio - labeled apremilast , about 58 % and 39 % of the radioactivity is recovered in urine and feces , respectively , with about 3 % and 7 % of the radioactive dose recovered as apremilast in urine and feces , respectively .
Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of apremilast is not affected by moderate or severe hepatic impairment .
Renal Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of apremilast is not affected by mild or moderate renal impairment .
In 8 subjects with severe renal impairment administered a single dose of 30 mg apremilast , the AUC and Cmax of apremilast increased by approximately 88 % and 42 % , respectively [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Age : A single oral dose of 30 - mg apremilast was studied in young adults and elderly healthy subjects .
The apremilast exposure in elderly subjects ( 65 to 85 years of age ) was about 13 % higher in AUC and about 6 % higher in Cmax than in young subjects ( 18 to 55 years of age ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Gender : In pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers , the extent of exposure in females was about 31 % higher and Cmax was about 8 % higher than that in male subjects .
Race and Ethnicity : The pharmacokinetics of apremilast in Chinese and Japanese healthy male subjects is comparable to that in Caucasian healthy male subjects .
In addition , apremilast exposure is similar among Hispanic Caucasians , non - Hispanic Caucasians , and African Americans .
Drug Interactions In vitro data : Apremilast is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 , or CYP3A4 and not an inducer of CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , or CYP3A4 .
Apremilast is a substrate , but not an inhibitor of P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) and is not a substrate or an inhibitor of organic anion transporter ( OAT ) 1 and OAT3 , organic cation transporter ( OCT ) 2 , organic anion transporting polypeptide ( OATP ) 1B1 and OATP1B3 , or breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) .
Drug interaction studies were performed with apremilast and CYP3A4 substrates ( oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate ) , CYP3A and P - gp inhibitor ( ketoconazole ) , CYP450 inducer ( rifampin ) and frequently co - administered drug in this patient population ( methotrexate ) .
No significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed when 30 - mg oral apremilast was administered with either oral contraceptive , ketoconazole , or methotrexate .
Co - administration of the CYP450 inducer rifampin ( 600 mg once daily for 15 days ) with a single oral dose of 30 - mg apremilast resulted in reduction of apremilast AUC and Cmax by 72 % and 43 % , respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies were conducted in mice and rats with apremilast to evaluate its carcinogenic potential .
No evidence of apremilast - induced tumors was observed in mice at oral doses up to 8 . 8 - times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose ( MRHD ) on an AUC basis ( 1 , 000 mg / kg / day ) or in rats at oral doses up to approximately 0 . 08 - and 1 . 1 - times the MRHD , ( 20 mg / kg / day in males and 3 mg / kg / day in females , respectively ) .
Apremilast tested negative in the Ames assay , in vitro chromosome aberration assay of human peripheral blood lymphocytes , and the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
In a fertility study of male mice , apremilast at oral doses up to approximately 3 - times the MRHD based on AUC ( up to 50 mg / kg / day ) produced no effects on male fertility .
In a fertility study of female mice , apremilast was administered at oral doses of 10 , 20 , 40 , or 80 mg / kg / day .
At doses ≥ 1 . 8 - times the MRHD ( ≥ 20 mg / kg / day ) , estrous cycles were prolonged , due to lengthening of diestrus which resulted in a longer interval until mating .
Mice that became pregnant at doses of 20 mg / kg / day and greater also had increased incidences of early postimplantation losses .
There was no effect of apremilast approximately 1 . 0 - times the MRHD ( 10 mg / kg / day ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 2 Psoriasis Two multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials ( Studies PSOR - 1 and PSOR - 2 ) enrolled a total of 1 , 257 subjects 18 years of age and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis [ body surface area ( BSA ) involvement of ≥ 10 % , static Physician Global Assessment ( sPGA ) of ≥ 3 ( moderate or severe disease ) , Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ( PASI ) score ≥ 12 , candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy ] .
Subjects were allowed to use low - potency topical corticosteroids on the face , axilla and groin .
Study PSOR - 1 enrolled 844 subjects and Study PSOR - 2 enrolled 413 subjects .
In both studies , subjects were randomized 2 : 1 to apremilast 30 mg BID or placebo for 16 weeks .
Both studies assessed the proportion of subjects who achieved PASI - 75 at Week 16 and the proportion of subjects who achieved a sPGA score of clear ( 0 ) or almost clear ( 1 ) at Week 16 .
Across both studies , subjects ranged in age from 18 to 83 years , with an overall median age of 46 years .
The mean baseline BSA involvement was 25 . 19 % ( median 21 . 0 % ) , the mean baseline PASI score was 19 . 07 ( median 16 . 80 ) , and the proportion of subjects with sPGA score of 3 ( moderate ) and 4 ( severe ) at baseline were 70 . 0 % and 29 . 8 % , respectively .
Approximately 30 % of all subjects had received prior phototherapy and 54 % had received prior conventional systemic and / or biologic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis with 37 % receiving prior conventional systemic therapy and 30 % receiving prior biologic therapy .
Approximately one - third of subjects had not received prior phototherapy , conventional systemic nor biologic therapy .
