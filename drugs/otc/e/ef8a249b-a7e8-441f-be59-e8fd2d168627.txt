6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rate observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
A total of 835 infants and young children were evaluated in the clinical development program .
Of 418 subjects in the VUSION group , 58 ( 14 % ) reported one or more adverse events .
Of 417 subjects in the zinc oxide / white petrolatum control group , 85 ( 20 % ) reported one or more adverse events .
Adverse events that occurred at a rate of ≥ 1 % for subjects who were treated with VUSION were approximately the same in type and frequency as for subjects who were treated with zinc oxide / white petrolatum ointment .
6 . 2 Post - marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of VUSION .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Gastrointestinal Disorders : vomiting General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : burning sensation , condition aggravated , inflammation , pain Injury , Poisoning and Procedural Complications : accidental exposure Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : blister , dermatitis contact , diaper dermatitis , dry skin , erythema , pruritus , rash , skin exfoliation 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug - drug interaction studies were not conducted .
Women who take a warfarin anticoagulant and use a miconazole intravaginal cream or suppository may be at risk for developing an increased prothrombin time , international normalized ratio ( INR ) , and bleeding .
The potential for this interaction between warfarin and VUSION is unknown .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on VUSION Ointment use in pregnant women to inform a drug ‑ associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , prolonged gestation , increased number of resorptions , and decreased numbers of live young were observed after oral administration of miconazole nitrate during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits .
No comparisons of animal exposure with human exposure may be calculated due to minimal systemic exposure in humans after topical administration of VUSION [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Miconazole nitrate administration has been shown to result in prolonged gestation and decreased numbers of live young in rats and in increased number of resorptions and decreased number of live young in rabbits at oral doses of 100 mg / kg / day and 80 mg / kg / day .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no available information on the presence of miconazole in human milk , or the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production following use of VUSION .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for VUSION and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from VUSION or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Efficacy was not demonstrated in infants less than 4 weeks of age .
Safety and efficacy have not been established in very - low - birth - weight infants ( less than 1500 g ) .
VUSION should not be used to prevent diaper dermatitis .

11 DESCRIPTION VUSION contains the synthetic antifungal agent , miconazole nitrate ( 0 . 25 % ) USP , zinc oxide ( 15 % ) USP , and white petrolatum ( 81 . 35 % ) USP .
The chemical name of miconazole nitrate is 1 - [ 2 , 4 - dichloro - ß - { ( 2 , 4 - dichlorobenzyl ) oxy } phenethyl ] imidazole mononitrate with empirical formula C18H14Cl4N2O • HNO3 and molecular weight of 479 . 15 .
The structural formula of miconazole nitrate is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The zinc oxide has an empirical formula of ZnO and a molecular weight of 81 . 39 .
The white petrolatum , which is obtained from petroleum and is wholly or nearly decolorized , is a purified mixture of semisolid saturated hydrocarbons having the general chemical formula CnH2n + 2 .
The hydrocarbons consist mainly of branched and unbranched chains .
White petrolatum contains butylated hydroxytoluene ( BHT ) as stabilizer .
Each gram of VUSION contains 2 . 5 mg of miconazole nitrate USP , 150 mg of zinc oxide USP , and 813 . 5 mg of white petrolatum USP containing butylated hydroxytoluene , trihydroxystearin , and Chemoderm 1001 / B fragrance .
VUSION is a smooth , uniform , white ointment .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The miconazole component of VUSION is an antifungal agent [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
The mechanism of action of white petrolatum and zinc oxide for the adjunctive treatment of diaper dermatitis is unknown .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The human pharmacodynamics of Vusion is unknown [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) for fungal pharmacodynamics ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The topical absorption of miconazole from VUSION was studied in immunocompetent male and female infants and children ( n = 17 ) with diaper dermatitis complicated by documented candidiasis ( microscopic evidence of pseudohyphae and / or budding yeast ) ranging in age from 1 month to 21 months .
After multiple daily applications to the affected area at every diaper change ( approximately 5 - 12 times per day ) for 7 days , the plasma concentrations of miconazole were below the lower limit of quantitation ( LOQ ) of 0 . 5 ng / mL in 15 out of 17 ( 88 % ) subjects .
In the other 2 remaining subjects , the plasma concentrations of miconazole were 0 . 57 and 0 . 58 ng / mL , respectively at a single timepoint ( 4 hours after the last application ) on Day 7 .
12 . 4 Microbiology The miconazole nitrate component in this product has been shown to have in vitro activity against Candida albicans , an organism that is associated with diaper dermatitis .
The activity of miconazole nitrate against C . albicans is based on the inhibition of the ergosterol biosynthesis in the cell membrane .
The accumulation of ergosterol precursors and toxic peroxides results in cytolysis of the cell .
In vitro minimal inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) test results for C . albicans isolates obtained from treatment failures in Clinical Study 1 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] does not appear to indicate that resistance to miconazole nitrate was the reason for treatment failure .
The clinical significance of the in vitro activity of miconazole nitrate against C . albicans in the setting of diaper dermatitis is unclear .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of VUSION in animals has not been evaluated .
Miconazole nitrate was negative in a bacterial reverse mutation test , a chromosome aberration test in mice , and micronucleus assays in mice and rats .
Miconazole nitrate had no adverse effect on fertility in a study in rats at oral doses of up to 320 mg / kg / day .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Study 1 was a double - blind , multicenter study in which VUSION was compared to the zinc oxide and white petrolatum combination treatment and included 236 infants and toddlers with diaper dermatitis , complicated by candidiasis as documented by KOH tests that demonstrated pseudohyphae and / or budding yeasts .
Study medication was applied at every diaper change for 7 days .
The primary endpoint was “ Overall Cure ” and required that subjects be both clinically cured ( total resolution of all signs and symptoms of infection ) and microbiologically cured ( eradication of candidiasis ) .
Primary efficacy was assessed 1 week following the end of treatment , at Day 14 .
Study results are shown in the following table .
Overall Cure at Day 14 VUSION n = 112 Zinc Oxide / White Petrolatum n = 124 26 ( 23 % ) 12 ( 10 % ) Two additional studies provided supportive evidence of the clinical efficacy of VUSION in infants and toddlers with diaper dermatitis , some of whom cultured positive for C . albicans .
However , candidal infection was not documented in the culture - positive subjects , as microscopic testing ( e . g . KOH ) was not done .
Therefore , the positive culture results may have reflected colonization rather than infection .
