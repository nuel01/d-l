It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Each gram contains Erythromycin USP 5 mg in a sterile ophthalmic base of mineral oil and white petrolatum .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Microbiology : Erythromycin inhibits protein synthesis without affecting nucleic acid synthesis .
Erythromycin is usually active against the following organisms in vitro and in clinical infections : Streptococcus pyogenes ( group A ß - hemolytic ) Alpha - hemolytic streptococci ( viridans group ) Staphylococcus aureus , including penicillinase - producing strains ( methicillin - resistant staphylococci are uniformly resistant to erythromycin ) Streptococcus pneumonia Mycoplasma pneumoniae ( Eaton Agent , PPLO ) Haemophilus influenzae ( not all strains of this organism are susceptible at the erythromycin concentrations ordinarily achieved ) Treponema pallidum Corynebacterium diphtheriae Neisseria gonorrhoeae Chlamydia trachomatis INDICATIONS AND USAGE : For the treatment of superficial ocular infections involving the conjunctiva and / or cornea caused by organisms susceptible to erythromycin .
For prophylaxis of ophthalmia neonatorum due to N . gonorrhoeae or C . trachomatis .
The effectiveness of erythromycin in the prevention of ophthalmia caused by penicillinase - producing N . gonorrheae is not established .
For infants born to mothers with clinically apparent gonorrhea , intravenous or intramuscular injections of aqueous crystalline penicillin G should be given ; a single dose of 50 , 000 units for term infants or 20 , 000 units for infants of low birth weight .
Topical prophylaxis alone is inadequate for these infants .
CONTRAINDICATIONS : This drug is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to erythromycin .
PRECAUTIONS : General : The use of antimicrobial agents may be associated with the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms including fungi ; in such a case , antibiotic administration should be stopped and appropriate measures taken .
Information for Patients : Avoid contaminating the applicator tip with material from the eye , fingers , or other source .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Two year oral studies conducted in rats with erythromycin did not provide evidence of tumorigenicity .
Mutagenicity studies have not been conducted .
No evidence of impaired fertility that appeared related to erythromycin was reported in animal studies .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic effects - Pregnancy Category B . Reproduction studies have been performed in rats , mice , and rabbits using erythromycin and its various salts and esters , at doses that were several multiples of the usual human dose .
No evidence of harm to the fetus that appeared related to erythromycin was reported in these studies .
There are , however , no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response , the erythromycins should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers : Caution should be exercised when erythromycin is administered to a nursing woman .
