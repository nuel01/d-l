[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Levsin ® inhibits specifically the actions of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation .
These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of the smooth muscle , cardiac muscle , the sinoatrial node , the atrioventricular node , and the exocrine glands .
At therapeutic doses , it is completely devoid of any action on autonomic ganglia .
Levsin ® inhibits gastrointestinal propulsive motility and decreases gastric acid secretion .
Levsin ® also controls excessive pharyngeal , tracheal and bronchial secretions .
Levsin ® is absorbed totally and completely by sublingual administration as well as oral administration .
Once absorbed , Levsin ® disappears rapidly from the blood and is distributed throughout the entire body .
The half - life of Levsin ® is 2 to 3 ½ hours .
Levsin ® is partly hydrolyzed to tropic acid and tropine but the majority of the drug is excreted in the urine unchanged within the first 12 hours .
Only traces of this drug are found in breast milk .
Levsin ® passes the blood brain barrier and the placental barrier .

Geriatric Use : Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in safety between patients aged 65 and over and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
