6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety data reflect exposure to ENDOMETRIN in 808 infertile women ( 74 . 9 % White , 10 . 3 % Hispanic , 5 . 4 % Black , 5 % Asian , and 4 . 6 % Other ) in a single Assisted Reproductive Technology 10 week clinical study conducted in the U . S . ENDOMETRIN was studied at doses of 100 mg twice daily and 100 mg three times daily .
The adverse reactions that occurred at a rate greater than or equal to 2 % in either ENDOMETRIN group are summarized in Table 1 .

6 . 2 Expected Adverse Reaction Profile Seen with Progesterone ENDOMETRIN is also expected to have adverse reactions similar to other drugs containing progesterone that may include breast tenderness , bloating , mood swings , irritability , and drowsiness .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug - drug interaction studies have been conducted for ENDOMETRIN .
Drugs known to induce the hepatic cytochrome - P450 - 3A4 system ( such as rifampin , carbamazepine ) may increase the elimination of progesterone .
The effect of concomitant vaginal products on the exposure of progesterone from ENDOMETRIN has not been assessed .
ENDOMETRIN is not recommended for use with other vaginal products ( such as antifungal products ) as this may alter progesterone release and absorption from the vaginal insert [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy ENDOMETRIN has been used to support embryo implantation and maintain clinical pregnancy in one clinical study .
The live birth outcomes of these pregnancies were as follows : • Among the 404 subjects treated with ENDOMETRIN twice daily , 143 subjects had live births consisting of 85 singletons , 56 twins , and 2 triplets .
In this treatment group , 13 subjects had a spontaneous abortion , 1 subject had an ectopic pregnancy , and 7 subjects reported fetal birth defects ( 3 . 4 % based on 203 livebirths ) .
• Among the 404 subjects treated with ENDOMETRIN three times daily , 155 subjects had livebirths consisting of 91 singletons , 60 twins , and 4 triplets .
In this treatment group , 22 subjects had a spontaneous abortion , 4 subjects had an ectopic pregnancy , and 7 subjects reported fetal birth defects ( 3 . 1 % based on 223 livebirths ) .
Birth defects reported in the ENDOMETRIN twice daily group included : one fetus with a cleft palate and intrauterine growth retardation , one fetus with spina bifida , three fetuses with congenital heart defects , one fetus with an umbilical hernia , and one fetus with an intestinal anomaly .
Birth defects reported in the ENDOMETRIN three times daily group included : one fetus with an esophageal fistula , one fetus with hypospadias and an underdeveloped right ear , one fetus with Down Syndrome and an atrial septal defect , one fetus with congenital heart anomalies , one fetus with DiGeorge ' s syndrome , one fetus with a hand deformity , and one fetus with cleft palate .

8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Detectable amounts of progesterone have been identified in the milk of nursing mothers .
The effect of this on the nursing infant has not been determined .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use This drug is not intended for pediatric use and no clinical data have been collected in children .
Therefore , the safety and effectiveness of ENDOMETRIN in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No clinical data have been collected in patients over age 65 .
10 OVERDOSAGE Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of ENDOMETRIN together with institution of appropriate symptomatic and supportive care .
11 DESCRIPTION ENDOMETRIN ( progesterone ) Vaginal Insert contains micronized progesterone .
ENDOMETRIN is supplied with polyethylene vaginal applicators .
The active ingredient , progesterone , is present in 100 mg amount along with other excipients .
The chemical name for progesterone is pregn - 4 - ene - 3 , 20 - dione .
It has an empirical formula of C21H30O2 and a molecular weight of 314 . 5 .
Progesterone exists in two polymorphic forms .
The form used in ENDOMETRIN , the alpha - form , has a melting point of 127 - 131 ° C .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Each ENDOMETRIN Vaginal Insert delivers 100 mg of progesterone in a base containing lactose monohydrate , polyvinylpyrrolidone , adipic acid , sodium bicarbonate , sodium lauryl sulfate , magnesium stearate , pregelatinized starch , and colloidal silicon dioxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Progesterone is a naturally occurring steroid that is secreted by the ovary , placenta , and adrenal gland .
In the presence of adequate estrogen , progesterone transforms a proliferative endometrium into a secretory endometrium .
Progesterone is necessary to increase endometrial receptivity for implantation of an embryo .
Once an embryo is implanted , progesterone acts to maintain a pregnancy .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Progesterone serum concentrations increased following the administration of the ENDOMETRIN Vaginal Insert in 12 healthy pre - menopausal females .
On single dosing , the mean Cmax was 17 . 0 ng / mL in the ENDOMETRIN twice daily group and 19 . 8 ng / mL in the ENDOMETRIN three times daily group .
On multiple dosing , steady - state concentrations were attained within approximately 1 day after initiation of treatment with ENDOMETRIN .
Both ENDOMETRIN regimens provided average serum concentrations of progesterone exceeding 10 ng / mL on Day 5 .
The pharmacokinetic results are summarized in Table 2 .

Metabolism Progesterone is metabolized primarily by the liver , largely to pregnanediols and pregnanolones .
Pregnanediols and pregnanolones are conjugated in the liver to glucuronide and sulfate metabolites .
Progesterone metabolites that are excreted in the bile may be deconjugated and may be further metabolized in the gut via reduction , dehydroxylation , and epimerization .
Excretion Progesterone undergoes renal and biliary elimination .
Following injection of labeled progesterone , 50 - 60 % of the excretion of metabolites occurs via the kidney ; approximately 10 % occurs via the bile and feces .
Overall recovery of the labeled material accounts for 70 % of an administered dose .
Only a small portion of unchanged progesterone is excreted in the bile .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Nonclinical toxicity studies to determine the potential of ENDOMETRIN to cause carcinogenicity or mutagenicity have not been performed .
The effect of ENDOMETRIN on fertility has not been evaluated in animals .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Luteal Supplementation During Assisted Reproductive Treatment Study A randomized , open - label , active - controlled study evaluated the efficacy of 10 weeks of treatment with two different daily dosing regimens of ENDOMETRIN ( 100 mg twice daily and 100 mg three times daily ) for support of implantation and early pregnancy in infertile women participating in an Assisted Reproductive Technology treatment program .
Efficacy was assessed on the endpoint of ongoing pregnancies , defined as the presence of at least one fetal heartbeat seen on ultrasound at 6 weeks post - embryo transfer .
The study randomized to ENDOMETRIN 808 infertile women ( 74 . 9 % White ; 10 . 3 % Hispanic , 5 . 4 % Black , 5 % Asian , and 4 . 6 % Other ) between 19 and 42 years of age ( mean age 33 ) who had a body mass index < 34 kg / m2 at screening .
The ongoing pregnancy rates for subjects treated with both dosing regimens of ENDOMETRIN were non - inferior ( lower bounds of the 95 % confidence interval of the difference between ENDOMETRIN and the active comparator excluded a difference greater than 10 % ) to the ongoing pregnancy rate for subjects treated with the active comparator .
The results of this study are shown in Table 3 .

Subjects participating in the study were stratified at randomization by age and ovarian reserve ( as measured by serum FSH levels ) .
The ongoing pregnancy rates for these subgroups are shown in Table 4 .

In women age 35 and older and in women with serum FSH levels between 10 and 15 IU / L , the results with respect to ongoing pregnancy rates for both dosing regimens of ENDOMETRIN did not reach the criteria for non - inferiority .
Subjects who became pregnant received study medication for a total of 10 weeks .
Patients over 34 kg / m2 were not studied .
The efficacy of ENDOMETRIN in this patient group is unknown .
