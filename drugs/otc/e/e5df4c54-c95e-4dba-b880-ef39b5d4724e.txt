1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE • Calcium Acetate Capsule is a phosphate binder indicated for the reduction of serum phosphorus in patients with end stage renal disease .
( 1 ) Calcium acetate capsule is a phosphate binder indicated to reduce serum phosphorus in patients with end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Starting dose is 2 capsules with each meal .
( 2 ) • Titrate the dose every 2 to 3 weeks until acceptable serum phosphorus level is reached .
Most patients require 3 to 4 capsules with each meal .
( 2 ) The recommended initial dose of calcium acetate capsule for the adult dialysis patient is 2 capsules with each meal .
Increase the dose gradually to lower serum phosphorus levels to the target range , as long as hypercalcemia does not develop .
Most patients require 3 - 4 capsules with each meal .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS • Capsule : 667 mg calcium acetate .
( 3 ) Capsule : 667 mg calcium acetate per capsule .
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Hypercalcemia .
( 4 ) Patients with hypercalcemia .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Treat mild hypercalcemia by reducing or interrupting calcium acetate and Vitamin D . Severe hypercalcemia may require hemodialysis and discontinuation of calcium acetate .
( 5 . 1 ) • Hypercalcemia may aggravate digitalis toxicity .
( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Hypercalcemia Patients with end stage renal disease may develop hypercalcemia when treated with calcium , including calcium acetate .
Avoid the use of calcium supplements , including calcium - based nonprescription antacids , concurrently with calcium acetate .
An overdose of calcium acetate may lead to progressive hypercalcemia , which may require emergency measures .
Therefore , early in the treatment phase during the dosage adjustment period , monitor serum calcium levels twice weekly .
Should hypercalcemia develop , reduce the calcium acetate dosage or discontinue the treatment , depending on the severity of hypercalcemia .
More severe hypercalcemia ( Ca > 12 mg / dL ) is associated with confusion , delirium , stupor and coma .
Severe hypercalcemia can be treated by acute hemodialysis and discontinuing calcium acetate therapy .
Mild hypercalcemia ( 10 . 5 to 11 . 9 mg / dL ) may be asymptomatic or manifest as constipation , anorexia , nausea , and vomiting .
Mild hypercalcemia is usually controlled by reducing the calcium acetate dose or temporarily discontinuing therapy .
Decreasing or discontinuing Vitamin D therapy is recommended as well .
Chronic hypercalcemia may lead to vascular calcification and other soft - tissue calcification .
Radiographic evaluation of suspected anatomical regions may be helpful in early detection of soft tissue calcification .
The long term effect of calcium acetate on the progression of vascular or soft tissue calcification has not been determined .
Hypercalcemia ( > 11 mg / dL ) was reported in 16 % of patients in a 3 - month study of a solid dose formulation of calcium acetate ; all cases resolved upon lowering the dose or discontinuing treatment .
Maintain the serum calcium - phosphorus ( Ca x P ) product below 55 mg2 / dL2 .
5 . 2 Concomitant Use with Medications Hypercalcemia may aggravate digitalis toxicity .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS • The most common ( > 10 % ) adverse reactions are hypercalcemia , nausea , and vomiting .
( 6 . 1 ) .
• In clinical studies , patients have occasionally experienced nausea during calcium acetate therapy .

Hypercalcemia is discussed elsewhere [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In clinical studies , calcium acetate has been generally well tolerated .
Calcium acetate was studied in a 3 - month , open - label , non - randomized study of 98 enrolled ESRD hemodialysis patients and in a two week double - blind , placebo - controlled , cross - over study with 69 enrolled ESRD hemodialysis patients .
Adverse reactions ( > 2 % on treatment ) from these trials are presented in Table 1 .
Table 1 : Adverse Reactions in Patients with End - Stage Renal Disease Undergoing Hemodialysis Preferred Term Total adverse reactions reported for calcium acetate n = 167 n ( % ) 3 - mo , open - label study of calcium acetate Double - blind , placebo - controlled , cross - over study of calcium acetate n = 69 n = 98 n ( % ) Calcium acetate n ( % ) Placebo n ( % ) Nausea 6 ( 3 . 6 ) 6 ( 6 . 1 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Vomiting 4 ( 2 . 4 ) 4 ( 4 . 1 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Hypercalcemia 21 ( 12 . 6 ) 16 ( 16 . 3 ) 5 ( 7 . 2 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Mild hypercalcemia may be asymptomatic or manifest itself as constipation , anorexia , nausea , and vomiting .
More severe hypercalcemia is associated with confusion , delirium , stupor , and coma .
Decreasing dialysate calcium concentration could reduce the incidence and severity of calcium acetate - induced hypercalcemia .
Isolated cases of pruritus have been reported , which may represent allergic reactions .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval of calcium acetate : dizziness , edema , and weakness .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Calcium acetate decrease the bioavailability of tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones .
( 7 ) • When clinically significant drug interactions are expected , administer the drug at least one hour before or at least three hours after calcium acetate , or consider monitoring blood levels of the drug .
( 7 ) The drug interaction of calcium acetate is characterized by the potential of calcium to bind to drugs with anionic functions ( e . g . , carboxyl and hydroxyl groups ) .
Calcium acetate may decrease the bioavailability of tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones via this mechanism .
There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between calcium acetate or calcium acetate capsules and most concomitant drugs .
When administering an oral medication with calcium acetate where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy , administer the drug one hour before or three hours after calcium acetate capsules or calcium acetate .
Monitor blood levels of the concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range .
Patients taking anti - arrhythmic medications for the control of arrhythmias and anti - seizure medications for the control of seizure disorders were excluded from the clinical trials with all forms of calcium acetate .
7 . 1 Ciprofloxacin In a study of 15 healthy subjects , a co - administered single dose of 4 calcium acetate tablets approximately 2 . 7 g , decreased the bioavailability of ciprofloxacin by approximately 50 % .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Calcium acetate capsules contain calcium acetate .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with calcium acetate , and there are no adequate and well controlled studies of calcium acetate use in pregnant women .
Patients with end stage renal disease may develop hypercalcemia with calcium acetate treatment [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Maintenance of normal serum calcium levels is important for maternal and fetal well being .
Hypercalcemia during pregnancy may increase the risk for maternal and neonatal complications such as stillbirth , preterm delivery , and neonatal hypocalcemia and hypoparathyroidism .
Calcium acetate treatment , as recommended , is not expected to harm a fetus if maternal calcium levels are properly monitored during and following treatment .
8 . 2 Labor and Delivery The effects of calcium acetate on labor and delivery are unknown .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Calcium acetate capsules contain calcium acetate and are excreted in human milk .
Human milk feeding by a mother receiving calcium acetate is not expected to harm an infant , provided maternal serum calcium levels are appropriately monitored .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of calcium acetate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
10 OVERDOSAGE Administration of calcium acetate in excess of the appropriate daily dosage may result in hypercalcemia [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Patients with ESRD retain phosphorus and can develop hyperphosphatemia .
High serum phosphorus can precipitate serum calcium resulting in ectopic calcification .
Hyperphosphatemia also plays a role in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with ESRD .
12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Calcium acetate , when taken with meals , combines with dietary phosphate to form an insoluble calcium phosphate complex , which is excreted in the feces , resulting in decreased serum phosphorus concentration .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Orally administered calcium acetate from pharmaceutical dosage forms is systemically absorbed up to approximately 40 % under fasting conditions and up to approximately 30 % under non - fasting conditions .
This range represents data from both healthy subjects and renal dialysis patients under various conditions .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity , mutagenicity , or fertility studies have been conducted with calcium acetate .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Effectiveness of calcium acetate in decreasing serum phosphorus has been demonstrated in two studies of the calcium acetate solid dosage form .
Ninety - one patients with end - stage renal disease who were undergoing hemodialysis and were hyperphosphatemic ( serum phosphorus > 5 . 5 mg / dL ) following a 1 - week phosphate binder washout period contributed efficacy data to an open - label , non - randomized study .
The patients received calcium acetate 667 mg tablets at each meal for a period of 12 weeks .
The initial starting dose was 2 tablets per meal for 3 meals a day , and the dose was adjusted as necessary to control serum phosphorus levels .
The average final dose after 12 weeks of treatment was 3 . 4 tablets per meal .
Although there was a decrease in serum phosphorus , in the absence of a control group the true magnitude of effect is uncertain .
The data presented in Table 2 demonstrate the efficacy of calcium acetate in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in end - stage renal disease patients .
The effects on serum calcium levels are also presented .

Two - thirds of the decline occurred in the first month of the study .
Serum calcium increased 9 % during the study mostly in the first month of the study .
Treatment with the phosphate binder was discontinued for patients from the open - label study , and those patients whose serum phosphorus exceeded 5 . 5 mg / dL were eligible for entry into a double - blind , placebo - controlled , cross - over study .
Patients were randomized to receive calcium acetate or placebo , and each continued to receive the same number of tablets as had been individually established during the previous study .
Following 2 weeks of treatment , patients switched to the alternative therapy for an additional 2 weeks .
The phosphate binding effect of calcium acetate is shown in the Table 3 .
