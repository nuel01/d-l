Description : Nizatidine ( USP ) is a histamine H2 - receptor antagonist .
Chemically , it is N - [ 2 - [ [ [ 2 - [ ( dimethylamino ) methyl ] - 4 - thiazolyl ] methyl ] thio ] ethyl ] - N ' - methyl - 2 - nitro - 1 , 1 - ethenediamine .
The structural formula is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Nizatidine has the empirical formula C12H21N5O2S2 representing a molecular weight of 331 . 47 .
It is an off - white to buff crystalline solid that is soluble in water .
Nizatidine has a bitter taste and mild sulfur - like odor .
Nizatidine oral solution is a clear , pale - yellow , peppermint flavored solution and each 1 mL contains 15 mg of nizatidine .
Nizatidine oral solution also contains the inactive ingredients anhydrous citric acid , glycerin , magnasweet , methylparaben , natural peppermint extract , povidone , propylparaben , purified water , saccharin sodium , sodium chloride , sodium citrate , sucrose and xanthan gum .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Clinical Pharmacology in Adults : Nizatidine is a competitive , reversible inhibitor of histamine at the histamine H2 - receptors , particularly those in the gastric parietal cells .
Antisecretory Activity — 1 .
Effects on Acid Secretion : Nizatidine significantly inhibited nocturnal gastric acid secretion for up to 12 hours .
Nizatidine also significantly inhibited gastric acid secretion stimulated by food , caffeine , betazole , and pentagastrin ( Table 1 ) .

Effects on Other Gastrointestinal Secretions — Pepsin : Oral administration of 75 to 300 mg of nizatidine did not affect pepsin activity in gastric secretions .
Total pepsin output was reduced in proportion to the reduced volume of gastric secretions .
Intrinsic Factor : Oral administration of 75 to 300 mg of nizatidine increased betazole - stimulated secretion of intrinsic factor .
Serum Gastrin Concentration : Nizatidine had no effect on basal serum gastrin concentration .
No rebound of gastrin secretion was observed when food was ingested 12 hours after administration of nizatidine .
3 .
Other Pharmacologic Actions — a . Hormones : Nizatidine was not shown to affect the serum concentrations of gonadotropins , prolactin , growth hormone , antidiuretic hormone , cortisol , triiodo - thyronine , thyroxin , testosterone , 5 α - dihydro - testosterone , androstenedione , or estradiol .
b . Nizatidine had no demonstrable antiandrogenic action .
4 .
Pharmacokinetics — The absolute oral bioavailability of nizatidine exceeds 70 % .
Peak plasma concentrations ( 700 to 1 , 800 mcg / L for a 150 mg dose and 1 , 400 to 3 , 600 mcg / L for a 300 mg dose ) occur from 0 . 5 to 3 hours following the dose .
Plasma concentrations 12 hours after administration are less than 10 mcg / L .
The elimination half - life is 1 to 2 hours , plasma clearance is 40 to 60 L / h , and the volume of distribution is 0 . 8 to 1 . 5 L / kg .
Because of the short half - life and rapid clearance of nizatidine , accumulation of the drug would not be expected in individuals with normal renal function who take either 300 mg once daily at bedtime or 150 mg twice daily .
Nizatidine exhibits dose proportionality over the recommended dose range .
The oral bioavailability of nizatidine is unaffected by concomitant ingestion of the anticholinergic propantheline .
Antacids consisting of aluminum and magnesium hydroxides with simethicone decrease the absorption of nizatidine by about 10 % .
With food , the AUC and Cmax increase by approximately 10 % .
In humans , less than 7 % of an oral dose is metabolized as N2 - monodesmethylnizatidine , an H2 - receptor antagonist , which is the principal metabolite excreted in the urine .
Other likely metabolites are the N2 - oxide ( less than 5 % of the dose ) and the S - oxide ( less than 6 % of the dose ) .
More than 90 % of an orally administered dose of nizatidine is excreted in the urine within 12 hours .
About 60 % of an oral dose is excreted as unchanged drug .
Renal clearance is about 500 mL / min , which indicates excretion by active tubular secretion .
Less than 6 % of an administered dose is eliminated in the feces .
Moderate to severe renal impairment significantly prolongs the half - life and decreases the clearance of nizatidine .
In individuals who are functionally anephric , the half - life is 3 . 5 to 11 hours , and the plasma clearance is 7 to 14 L / h .
To avoid accumulation of the drug in individuals with clinically significant renal impairment , the amount and / or frequency of doses of nizatidine should be reduced in proportion to the severity of dysfunction ( see Dosage and Administration ) .
Approximately 35 % of nizatidine is bound to plasma protein , mainly to α1 - acid glycoprotein .
Warfarin , diazepam , acetaminophen , propantheline , phenobarbital , and propranolol did not affect plasma protein binding of nizatidine in vitro .
At a dose of 150 mg , the nizatidine oral solution ( 15 mg / mL ) is bioequivalent to nizatidine capsules .
Clinical Pharmacology in Pediatric Patients : Pharmacokinetics Table 2 presents pharmacokinetic data of nizatidine administered orally to adolescents with gastroesophageal reflux ( GER ) and healthy adults .
Pharmacokinetic parameters for adolescent patients ages 12 to 18 years are comparable to those obtained for adults .

Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of nizatidine was evaluated in 48 pediatric patients .
These data suggest that gastric acid suppression is similar to that observed in adult studies ( Table 3 ) .

Active Duodenal Ulcer : In multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled studies in the United States , endoscopically diagnosed duodenal ulcers healed more rapidly following administration of nizatidine , 300 mg h . s . or 150 mg b . i . d . , than with placebo ( Table 4 ) .
Lower doses , such as 100 mg h . s . , had slightly lower effectiveness .

Maintenance of Healed Duodenal Ulcer : Treatment with a reduced dose of nizatidine has been shown to be effective as maintenance therapy following healing of active duodenal ulcers .
In multi - center , double - blind , placebo - controlled studies conducted in the United States , 150 mg of nizatidine taken at bedtime resulted in a significantly lower incidence of duodenal ulcer recurrence in patients treated for up to 1 year ( Table 5 ) .

Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease ( GERD ) : In 2 multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trials performed in the United States and Canada , nizatidine was more effective than placebo in improving endoscopically diagnosed esophagitis and in healing erosive and ulcerative esophagitis .
In patients with erosive or ulcerative esophagitis , 150 mg b . i . d . of nizatidine given to 88 patients compared with placebo in 98 patients in Study 1 yielded a higher healing rate at 3 weeks ( 16 % vs 7 % ) and at 6 weeks ( 32 % vs 16 % , P < 0 . 05 ) .
Of 99 patients on nizatidine and 94 patients on placebo , Study 2 at the same dosage yielded similar results at 6 weeks ( 21 % vs 11 % , P < 0 . 05 ) and at 12 weeks ( 29 % vs 13 % , P < 0 . 01 ) .
In addition , relief of associated heartburn was greater in patients treated with nizatidine .
Patients treated with nizatidine consumed fewer antacids than did patients treated with placebo .
4 .
Active Benign Gastric Ulcer : In a multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled study conducted in the United States and Canada , endoscopically diagnosed benign gastric ulcers healed significantly more rapidly following administration of nizatidine than of placebo ( Table 6 ) .
Table 6 .

In a multicenter , double - blind , comparator - controlled study in Europe , healing rates for patients receiving nizatidine ( 300 mg h . s . or 150 mg b . i . d . ) were equivalent to rates for patients receiving a comparator drug , and statistically superior to historical placebo control rates .
Indications and Usage : Nizatidine oral solution is indicated for up to 8 weeks for the treatment of active duodenal ulcer .
In most patients , the ulcer will heal within 4 weeks .
Nizatidine oral solution is indicated for maintenance therapy for duodenal ulcer patients at a reduced dosage of 150 mg h . s . after healing of an active duodenal ulcer .
The consequences of continuous therapy with nizatidine for longer than 1 year are not known .
Nizatidine oral solution is indicated for up to 12 weeks for the treatment of endoscopically diagnosed esophagitis , including erosive and ulcerative esophagitis , and associated heartburn due to GERD .
Nizatidine oral solution is indicated for up to 8 weeks for the treatment of active benign gastric ulcer .
Before initiating therapy , care should be taken to exclude the possibility of malignant gastric ulceration .
In pediatric patients , nizatidine oral solution is indicated for ages 12 years and older .
Nizatidine oral solution is indicated for up to 8 weeks for the treatment of endoscopically diagnosed esophagitis , including erosive and ulcerative esophagitis , and associated heartburn due to GERD .
Contraindication : Nizatidine oral solution is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug .
Because cross - sensitivity in this class of compounds has been observed , H2 - receptor antagonists , including nizatidine , should not be administered to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to other H2 - receptor antagonists .
Precautions : General — 1 .
Symptomatic response to nizatidine therapy does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy .
2 .
Because nizatidine is excreted primarily by the kidney , dosage should be reduced in patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency ( see Dosage and Administration ) .
3 .
Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with hepatorenal syndrome have not been done .
Part of the dose of nizatidine is metabolized in the liver .
In patients with normal renal function and uncomplicated hepatic dysfunction , the disposition of nizatidine is similar to that in normal subjects .
Laboratory Tests — False - positive tests for urobilinogen with Multistix ® may occur during therapy with nizatidine .
Drug Interactions — No interactions have been observed between nizatidine and theophylline , chlordiazepoxide , lorazepam , lidocaine , phenytoin , and warfarin .
Nizatidine does not inhibit the cytochrome P - 450 - linked drug - metabolizing enzyme system ; therefore , drug interactions mediated by inhibition of hepatic metabolism are not expected to occur .
In patients given very high doses ( 3 , 900 mg ) of aspirin daily , increases in serum salicylate levels were seen when nizatidine , 150 mg b . i . d . , was administered concurrently .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility — A 2 - year oral carcinogenicity study in rats with doses as high as 500 mg / kg / day ( about 13 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) showed no evidence of a carcinogenic effect .
There was a dose - related increase in the density of enterochromaffin - like ( ECL ) cells in the gastric oxyntic mucosa .
In a 2 - year study in mice , there was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect in male mice ; although hyperplastic nodules of the liver were increased in the high - dose males as compared with placebo .
Female mice given the high dose of nizatidine ( 2 , 000 mg / kg / day , about 27 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) showed marginally statistically significant increases in hepatic carcinoma and hepatic nodular hyperplasia with no numerical increase seen in any of the other dose groups .
The rate of hepatic carcinoma in the high - dose animals was within the historical control limits seen for the strain of mice used .
The female mice were given a dose larger than the maximum tolerated dose , as indicated by excessive ( 30 % ) weight decrement as compared with concurrent controls and evidence of mild liver injury ( transaminase elevations ) .
The occurrence of a marginal finding at high dose only in animals given an excessive and somewhat hepatotoxic dose , with no evidence of a carcinogenic effect in rats , male mice , and female mice ( given up to 360 mg / kg / day , about 5 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) , and a negative mutagenicity battery are not considered evidence of a carcinogenic potential for nizatidine .
Nizatidine was not mutagenic in a battery of tests performed to evaluate its potential genetic toxicity , including bacterial mutation tests , unscheduled DNA synthesis , sister chromatid exchange , mouse lymphoma assay , chromosome aberration tests , and a micronucleus test .
In a 2 - generation , perinatal and postnatal fertility study in rats , doses of nizatidine up to 650 mg / kg / day ( about 17 . 5 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) produced no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of parental animals or their progeny .
Pregnancy — Teratogenic Effects — Pregnancy Category B — Oral reproduction studies in pregnant rats at doses up to 1500 mg / kg / day ( about 40 . 5 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) and in pregnant rabbits at doses up to 275 mg / kg / day ( about 14 . 6 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to nizatidine .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers — Studies conducted in lactating women have shown that 0 . 1 % of the administered oral dose of nizatidine is secreted in human milk in proportion to plasma concentrations .
Because of the growth depression in pups reared by lactating rats treated with nizatidine , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
Pediatric Use — Effectiveness in pediatric patients < 12 years of age has not been established .
Use of nizatidine in pediatric patients from 12 to 18 years of age is supported by evidence from published pediatric literature , adequate and well - controlled published studies in adults , and by the following adequate and well - controlled studies in pediatric patients : ( see Dosage and Administration ) Clinical Trials ( Pediatric ) .
In randomized studies , nizatidine was administered to pediatric patients for up to eight weeks , using age appropriate formulations .
A total of 230 pediatric patients from 2 to 18 years of age were administered nizatidine at a dose of either 2 . 5 mg / kg b . i . d , or 5 . 0 mg / kg b . i . d , ( patients 12 years and under ) or 150 mg b . i . d ( 12 to 18 years ) .
Patients were required to have either symptomatic , clinically suspected or endoscopically diagnosed GERD with age - relevant symptoms .
In patients 2 to 18 years of age , nizatidine was found generally safe and well - tolerated .
In these studies in patients 12 years and older , nizatidine was found to reduce the severity and frequency of GERD symptoms , improve physical well - being , and reduce the frequency of supplemental antacid consumption .
No efficacy in pediatric patients < 12 years of age has been established .
Clinical studies in patients 2 to 12 years of age with GERD , demonstrated no difference in either symptom improvements or healing rates between nizatidine and placebo or between different doses of nizatidine .
Geriatric Use — Of the 955 patients in clinical studies who were treated with nizatidine , 337 ( 35 . 3 % ) were 65 and older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these and younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function ( see Dosage and Administration ) .
Adverse Reactions in Adults : Worldwide , controlled clinical trials of nizatidine included over 6 , 000 patients given nizatidine in studies of varying durations .
Placebo - controlled trials in the United States and Canada included over 2 , 600 patients given nizatidine and over 1 , 700 given placebo .
Among the adverse events in these placebo - controlled trials , anemia ( 0 . 2 % vs 0 % ) and urticaria ( 0 . 5 % vs 0 . 1 % ) were significantly more common in the nizatidine group .
Incidence in Placebo - Controlled Clinical Trials in the United States and Canada — Table 7 lists adverse events that occurred at a frequency of 1 % or more among nizatidine - treated patients who participated in placebo - controlled trials .
The cited figures provide some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non - drug factors to the side - effect incidence rate in the population studied .

A variety of less common events were also reported ; it was not possible to determine whether these were caused by nizatidine .
Hepatic — Hepatocellular injury , evidenced by elevated liver enzyme tests ( SGOT [ AST ] , SGPT [ ALT ] , or alkaline phosphatase ) , occurred in some patients and was possibly or probably related to nizatidine .
In some cases , there was marked elevation of SGOT , SGPT enzymes ( greater than 500 IU / L ) and , in a single instance , SGPT was greater than 2 , 000 IU / L .
The overall rate of occurrences of elevated liver enzymes and elevations to 3 times the upper limit of normal , however , did not significantly differ from the rate of liver enzyme abnormalities in placebo - treated patients .
All abnormalities were reversible after discontinuation of nizatidine .
Since market introduction , hepatitis and jaundice have been reported .
Rare cases of cholestatic or mixed hepatocellular and cholestatic injury with jaundice have been reported with reversal of the abnormalities after discontinuation of nizatidine .
Cardiovascular — In clinical pharmacology studies , short episodes of asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia occurred in 2 individuals administered nizatidine and in 3 untreated subjects .
CNS — Rare cases of reversible mental confusion have been reported .
Endocrine — Clinical pharmacology studies and controlled clinical trials showed no evidence of antiandrogenic activity due to nizatidine .
Impotence and decreased libido were reported with similar frequency by patients who received nizatidine and by those given placebo .
Rare reports of gynecomastia occurred .
Hematologic — Anemia was reported significantly more frequently in nizatidine - than in placebo - treated patients .
Fatal thrombocytopenia was reported in a patient who was treated with nizatidine and another H2 - receptor antagonist .
On previous occasions , this patient had experienced thrombocytopenia while taking other drugs .
Rare cases of thrombocytopenic purpura have been reported .
Integumental — Sweating and urticaria were reported significantly more frequently in nizatidine - than in placebo - treated patients .
Rash and exfoliative dermatitis were also reported .
Vasculitis has been reported rarely .
Hypersensitivity — As with other H2 - receptor antagonists , rare cases of anaphylaxis following administration of nizatidine have been reported .
Rare episodes of hypersensitivity reactions ( eg , bronchospasm , laryngeal edema , rash , and eosinophilia ) have been reported .
Body as a Whole — Serum sickness - like reactions have occurred rarely in conjunction with nizatidine use .
Genitourinary — Reports of impotence have occurred .
Other — Hyperuricemia unassociated with gout or nephrolithiasis was reported .
Eosinophilia , fever , and nausea related to nizatidine administration have been reported .
Adverse Reactions ( Pediatric ) : In controlled clinical trials in pediatric patients ( age 2 to 18 years ) , nizatidine was found to be generally safe and well tolerated .
The principal adverse experiences ( > 5 % ) were pyrexia , nasopharyngitis , diarrhea , vomiting , irritability , nasal congestion and cough .
Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity .
Mild elevations in serum transaminase ( 1 to 2 x ULN ) were noted in some patients .
One subject experienced a seizure by EEG diagnosis after taking nizatidine oral solution 2 . 5 mg / kg b . i . d . for 23 days .
The adverse reactions reported for nizatidine may also occur with nizatidine oral solution .
Overdosage : Overdoses of nizatidine have been reported rarely .
The following is provided to serve as a guide should such an overdose be encountered .
Signs and Symptoms — There is little clinical experience with overdosage of nizatidine in humans .
Test animals that received large doses of nizatidine have exhibited cholinergic - type effects , including lacrimation , salivation , emesis , miosis , and diarrhea .
Single oral doses of 800 mg / kg in dogs and of 1 , 200 mg / kg in monkeys were not lethal .
Intravenous median lethal doses in the rat and mouse were 301 mg / kg and 232 mg / kg respectively .
In the two 8 - week pediatric exposure trials of nizatidine in 256 pediatric patients , there were no cases of deliberate overdosage .
In one study of nizatidine 10 mg / kg / day , drug compliance rates up to 7 . 5 % above 100 % compliance were not associated with clinically significant adverse events .
Treatment — To obtain up - to - date information about the treatment of overdose , a good resource is your certified Regional Poison Control Center .
Telephone numbers of certified Poison Control Centers are listed in the Physicians ’ Desk Reference ( PDR ) .
In managing overdosage , consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses , interaction among drugs , and unusual drug kinetics in your patient .
If overdosage occurs , use of activated charcoal , emesis , or lavage should be considered along with clinical monitoring and supportive therapy .
The ability of hemodialysis to remove nizatidine from the body has not been conclusively demonstrated ; however , due to its large volume of distribution , nizatidine is not expected to be efficiently removed from the body by this method .
