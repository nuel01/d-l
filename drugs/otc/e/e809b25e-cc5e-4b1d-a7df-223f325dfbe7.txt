DESCRIPTION Atracurium besylate is an intermediate - duration , nondepolarizing , skeletal muscle relaxant for intravenous administration .
Atracurium besylate is designated as 2 - ( 2 - Carboxyethyl ) - 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 - tetrahydro - 6 , 7 - dimethoxy - 2 - methyl - 1 - veratrylisoquinolinium benzenesulfonate , pentamethylene ester .
It has a molecular weight of 1243 . 49 , and its molecular formula is C65H82N2O18S2 .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Atracurium besylate is a complex molecule containing four sites at which different stereochemical configurations can occur .
The symmetry of the molecule , however , results in only ten , instead of sixteen , possible different isomers .
The manufacture of atracurium besylate results in these isomers being produced in unequal amounts but with a consistent ratio .
Those molecules in which the methyl group attached to the quaternary nitrogen projects on the opposite side to the adjacent substituted - benzyl moiety predominate by approximately 3 : 1 .
Atracurium Besylate Injection USP is a sterile , non - pyrogenic aqueous solution .
Each mL contains 10 mg atracurium besylate .
The pH is adjusted to 3 . 00 to 3 . 65 with benzenesulfonic acid .
The multiple dose vial contains 0 . 9 % benzyl alcohol added as a preservative .
Atracurium besylate injection slowly loses potency with time at the rate of approximately 6 % per year under refrigeration ( 5 ° C ) .
Atracurium besylate injection should be refrigerated at 2 ° C to 8 ° C ( 36 ° F to 46 ° F ) to preserve potency .
Rate of loss in potency increases to approximately 5 % per month at 25 ° C ( 77 ° F ) .
Upon removal from refrigeration to room temperature storage conditions ( 25 ° C / 77 ° F ) , use atracurium besylate injection within 14 days even if rerefrigerated .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Atracurium besylate is a nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant .
Nondepolarizing agents antagonize the neurotransmitter action of acetylcholine by binding competitively with cholinergic receptor sites on the motor end - plate .
This antagonism is inhibited , and neuromuscular block reversed , by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine , edrophonium , and pyridostigmine .
Atracurium can be used most advantageously if muscle twitch response to peripheral nerve stimulation is monitored to assess degree of muscle relaxation .
The duration of neuromuscular block produced by atracurium is approximately one - third to one - half the duration of block by d - tubocurarine , metocurine , and pancuronium at initially equipotent doses .
As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers , the time to onset of paralysis decreases and the duration of maximum effect increases with increasing atracurium doses .
The ED95 ( dose required to produce 95 % suppression of the muscle twitch response with balanced anesthesia ) has averaged 0 . 23 mg / kg ( 0 . 11 to 0 . 26 mg / kg in various studies ) .
An initial atracurium dose of 0 . 4 to 0 . 5 mg / kg generally produces maximum neuromuscular block within 3 to 5 minutes of injection , with good or excellent intubation conditions within 2 to 2 . 5 minutes in most patients .
Recovery from neuromuscular block ( under balanced anesthesia ) can be expected to begin approximately 20 to 35 minutes after injection .
Under balanced anesthesia , recovery to 25 % of control is achieved approximately 35 to 45 minutes after injection , and recovery is usually 95 % complete approximately 60 to 70 minutes after injection .
The neuromuscular blocking action of atracurium is enhanced in the presence of potent inhalation anesthetics .
Isoflurane and enflurane increase the potency of atracurium and prolong neuromuscular block by approximately 35 % ; however , halothane ’ s potentiating effect ( approximately 20 % ) is marginal ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Repeated administration of maintenance doses of atracurium has no cumulative effect on the duration of neuromuscular block if recovery is allowed to begin prior to repeat dosing .
Moreover , the time needed to recover from repeat doses does not change with additional doses .
Repeat doses can therefore be administered at relatively regular intervals with predictable results .
After an initial dose of 0 . 4 to 0 . 5 mg / kg under balanced anesthesia , the first maintenance dose ( suggested maintenance dose is 0 . 08 to 0 . 10 mg / kg ) is generally required within 20 to 45 minutes , and subsequent maintenance doses are usually required at approximately 15 to 25 minute intervals .
Once recovery from atracurium ’ s neuromuscular blocking effects begins , it proceeds more rapidly than recovery from d - tubocurarine , metocurine , and pancuronium .
Regardless of the atracurium dose , the time from start of recovery ( from complete block ) to complete ( 95 % ) recovery is approximately 30 minutes under balanced anesthesia , and approximately 40 minutes under halothane , enflurane or isoflurane .
Repeated doses have no cumulative effect on recovery rate .
Reversal of neuromuscular block produced by atracurium can be achieved with an anti - cholinesterase agent such as neostigmine , edrophonium , or pyridostigmine , in conjunction with an anticholinergic agent such as atropine or glycopyrrolate .
Under balanced anesthesia , reversal can usually be attempted approximately 20 to 35 minutes after an initial atracurium besylate dose of 0 . 4 to 0 . 5 mg / kg , or approximately 10 to 30 minutes after a 0 . 08 to 0 . 10 mg / kg maintenance dose , when recovery of muscle twitch has started .
Complete reversal is usually attained within 8 to 10 minutes of the administration of reversing agents .
Rare instances of breathing difficulties , possibly related to incomplete reversal , have been reported following attempted pharmacologic antagonism of atracurium - induced neuromuscular block .
As with other agents in this class , the tendency for residual neuromuscular block is increased if reversal is attempted at deep levels of block or if inadequate doses of reversal agents are employed .
The pharmacokinetics of atracurium in humans are essentially linear within the 0 . 3 to 0 . 6 mg / kg dose range .
The elimination half - life is approximately 20 minutes .
THE DURATION OF NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCK PRODUCED BY ATRACURIUM BESYLATE DOES NOT CORRELATE WITH PLASMA PSEUDOCHOLINESTERASE LEVELS AND IS NOT ALTERED BY THE ABSENCE OF RENAL FUNCTION .
This is consistent with the results of in vitro studies which have shown that atracurium is inactivated in plasma via two nonoxidative pathways : ester hydrolysis , catalyzed by nonspecific esterases ; and Hofmann elimination , a nonenzymatic chemical process which occurs at physiological pH . Some placental transfer occurs in humans .
Radiolabel studies demonstrated that atracurium undergoes extensive degradation in cats , and that neither kidney nor liver plays a major role in this elimination .
Biliary and urinary excretion were the major routes of excretion of radioactivity ( totaling > 90 % of the labeled dose within 7 hours of dosing ) , of which atracurium represented only a minor fraction .
The metabolites in bile and urine were similar , including products of Hofmann elimination and ester hydrolysis .
Elderly patients may have slightly altered pharmacokinetic parameters compared to younger patients , with a slightly decreased total plasma clearance which is offset by a corresponding increase in volume of distribution .
The net effect is that there has been no significant difference in clinical duration and recovery from neuromuscular block observed between elderly and younger patients receiving atracurium besylate .
Atracurium is a less potent histamine releaser than d - tubocurarine or metocurine .
Histamine release is minimal with initial atracurium besylate doses up to 0 . 5 mg / kg , and hemodynamic changes are minimal within the recommended dose range .
A moderate histamine release and significant falls in blood pressure have been seen following 0 . 6 mg / kg of atracurium besylate .
The histamine and hemodynamic responses were poorly correlated .
The effects were generally short - lived and manageable , but the possibility of substantial histamine release in sensitive individuals or in patients in whom substantial histamine release would be especially hazardous ( e . g . , patients with significant cardiovascular disease ) must be considered .
It is not known whether the prior use of other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has any effect on the activity of atracurium .
The prior use of succinylcholine decreases by approximately 2 to 3 minutes the time to maximum block induced by atracurium besylate , and may increase the depth of block .
Atracurium should be administered only after a patient recovers from succinylcholine - induced neuromuscular block .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Atracurium besylate injection is indicated , as an adjunct to general anesthesia , to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Atracurium besylate is contraindicated in patients known to have a hypersensitivity to it .
Use of atracurium besylate from multiple dose vials containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to benzyl alcohol .
WARNINGS ATRACURIUM SHOULD BE USED ONLY BY THOSE SKILLED IN AIRWAY MANAGEMENT AND RESPIRATORY SUPPORT .
EQUIPMENT AND PERSONNEL MUST BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FOR ENDOTRACHEAL INTUBATION AND SUPPORT OF VENTILATION , INCLUDING ADMINISTRATION OF POSITIVE PRESSURE OXYGEN .
ADEQUACY OF RESPIRATION MUST BE ASSURED THROUGH ASSISTED OR CONTROLLED VENTILATION .
ANTICHOLINESTERASE REVERSAL AGENTS SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE .
DO NOT GIVE ATRACURIUM BESYLATE BY INTRAMUSCULAR ADMINISTRATION .
Atracurium has no known effect on consciousness , pain threshold , or cerebration .
It should be used only with adequate anesthesia .
Atracurium besylate injection , which has an acid pH , should not be mixed with alkaline solutions ( e . g . , barbiturate solutions ) in the same syringe or administered simultaneously during intravenous infusion through the same needle .
Depending on the resultant pH of such mixtures , atracurium may be inactivated and a free acid may be precipitated .
Atracurium besylate injection 10 mL multiple dose vials contain benzyl alcohol .
In neonates , benzyl alcohol has been associated with an increased incidence of neurological and other complications which are sometimes fatal .
Atracurium besylate 5 mL single use vials do not contain benzyl alcohol ( see PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use ) .
Anaphylaxis : Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents , including atracurium besylate , have been reported .
These reactions have in some cases been life - threatening and fatal .
Due to the potential severity of these reactions , the necessary precautions , such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment , should be taken .
Precautions should also be taken in those individuals who have had previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents since cross - reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents , both depolarizing and non - depolarizing , has been reported in this class of drugs .
Risk of Death due to Medication Errors : Administration of atracurium besylate results in paralysis , which may lead to respiratory arrest and death ; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended .
Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings .
If another healthcare provider is administering the product , ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated .
PRECAUTIONS Since allergic cross - reactivity has been reported in this class , request information from your patients about previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents .
In addition , inform your patients that severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents , including atracurium besylate have been reported .
General : Although atracurium is a less potent histamine releaser than d - tubocurarine or metocurine , the possibility of substantial histamine release in sensitive individuals must be considered .
Special caution should be exercised in administering atracurium to patients in whom substantial histamine release would be especially hazardous ( e . g . , patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease ) and in patients with any history ( e . g . , severe anaphylactoid reactions or asthma ) suggesting a greater risk of histamine release .
In these patients , the recommended initial atracurium besylate dose is lower ( 0 . 3 to 0 . 4 mg / kg ) than for other patients and should be administered slowly or in divided doses over one minute .
Since atracurium has no clinically significant effects on heart rate in the recommended dosage range , it will not counteract the bradycardia produced by many anesthetic agents or vagal stimulation .
As a result , bradycardia during anesthesia may be more common with atracurium than with other muscle relaxants .
Atracurium may have profound effects in patients with myasthenia gravis , Eaton - Lambert syndrome , or other neuromuscular diseases in which potentiation of nondepolarizing agents has been noted .
The use of a peripheral nerve stimulator is especially important for assessing neuromuscular block in these patients .
Similar precautions should be taken in patients with severe electrolyte disorders or carcinomatosis .
Multiple factors in anesthesia practice are suspected of triggering malignant hyperthermia ( MH ) , a potentially fatal hypermetabolic state of skeletal muscle .
Halogenated anesthetic agents and succinylcholine are recognized as the principal pharmacologic triggering agents in MH - susceptible patients ; however , since MH can develop in the absence of established triggering agents , the clinician should be prepared to recognize and treat MH in any patient scheduled for general anesthesia .
Reports of MH have been rare in cases in which atracurium has been used .
In studies of MH - susceptible animals ( swine ) and in a clinical study of MH - susceptible patients , atracurium did not trigger this syndrome .
Resistance to nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents may develop in burn patients .
Increased doses of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants may be required in burn patients and are dependent on the time elapsed since the burn injury and the size of the burn .
The safety of atracurium has not been established in patients with bronchial asthma .
Long - Term Use in Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) : When there is a need for long - term mechanical ventilation , the benefits - to - risk ratio of neuromuscular block must be considered .
The long - term ( 1 to 10 days ) infusion of atracurium besylate during mechanical ventilation in the ICU has been evaluated in several studies .
Average infusion rates of 11 to 13 mcg / kg per minute ( range : 4 . 5 to 29 . 5 ) were required to achieve adequate neuromuscular block .
These data suggest that there is wide interpatient variability in dosage requirements .
In addition , these studies have shown that dosage requirements may decrease or increase with time .
Following discontinuation of infusion of atracurium besylate in these ICU studies , spontaneous recovery of four twitches in a train - of - four occurred in an average of approximately 30 minutes ( range : 15 to 75 minutes ) and spontaneous recovery to a train - of - four ratio > 75 % ( the ratio of height of the fourth to the first twitch in a train - of - four ) occurred in an average of approximately 60 minutes ( range : 32 to 108 minutes ) .
Little information is available on the plasma levels and clinical consequences of atracurium metabolites that may accumulate during days to weeks of atracurium administration in ICU patients .
Laudanosine , a major biologically active metabolite of atracurium without neuromuscular blocking activity , produces transient hypotension and , in higher doses , cerebral excitatory effects ( generalized muscle twitching and seizures ) when administered to several species of animals .
There have been rare spontaneous reports of seizures in ICU patients who have received atracurium or other agents .
These patients usually had predisposing causes ( such as head trauma , cerebral edema , hypoxic encephalopathy , viral encephalitis , uremia ) .
There are insufficient data to determine whether or not laudanosine contributes to seizures in ICU patients .
WHENEVER THE USE OF ATRACURIUM OR ANY NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKING AGENT IS CONTEMPLATED IN THE ICU , IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT NEUROMUSCULAR TRANSMISSION BE MONITORED CONTINUOUSLY DURING ADMINISTRATION WITH THE HELP OF A NERVE STIMULATOR .
ADDITIONAL DOSES OF ATRACURIUM OR ANY OTHER NEUROMUSCULAR BLOCKING AGENT SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN BEFORE THERE IS A DEFINITE RESPONSE TO T1 OR TO THE FIRST TWITCH .
IF NO RESPONSE IS ELICITED , INFUSION ADMINISTRATION SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED UNTIL A RESPONSE RETURNS .
Hemofiltration has a minimal effect on plasma levels of atracurium and its metabolites , including laudanosine .
The effects of hemodialysis and hemoperfusion on plasma levels of atracurium and its metabolites are unknown .
Drug Interactions : Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of atracurium include : enflurane ; isoflurane ; halothane ; certain antibiotics , especially the aminoglycosides and polymyxins ; lithium ; magnesium salts ; procainamide ; and quinidine .
If other muscle relaxants are used during the same procedure , the possibility of a synergistic or antagonist effect should be considered .
The prior administration of succinylcholine does not enhance the duration , but quickens the onset and may increase the depth , of neuromuscular block induced by atracurium besylate .
Atracurium should not be administered until a patient has recovered from succinylcholine - induced neuromuscular block .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Carcinogenesis and fertility studies have not been performed .
Atracurium was evaluated in a battery of three short - term mutagenicity tests .
It was non - mutagenic in both the Ames Salmonella assay at concentrations up to 1000 mcg / plate , and in a rat bone marrow cytogenicity assay at up to paralyzing doses .
A positive response was observed in the mouse lymphoma assay under conditions ( 80 and 100 mcg / mL , in the absence of metabolic activation ) which killed over 80 % of the treated cells ; there was no mutagenicity at 60 mcg / mL and lower , concentrations which killed up to half of the treated cells .
A far weaker response was observed in the presence of metabolic activation at concentrations ( 1200 mcg / mL and higher ) which also killed over 80 % of the treated cells .
Mutagenicity testing is intended to simulate chronic ( years to lifetime ) exposure in an effort to determine potential carcinogenicity .
Thus , a single positive mutagenicity response for a drug used infrequently and / or briefly is of questionable clinical relevance .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects : Atracurium besylate has been shown to be potentially teratogenic in rabbits when given in doses up to approximately one - half the human dose .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Atracurium should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Atracurium besylate was administered subcutaneously on days 6 through 18 of gestation to nonventilated Dutch rabbits .
Treatment groups were given either 0 . 15 mg / kg once daily or 0 . 10 mg / kg twice daily .
Lethal respiratory distress occurred in two 0 . 15 mg / kg animals and in one 0 . 10 mg / kg animal , with transient respiratory distress or other evidence of neuromuscular block occurring in 10 of 19 and in 4 of 20 of the 0 . 15 mg / kg and 0 . 10 mg / kg animals , respectively .
There was an increased incidence of certain spontaneously occurring visceral and skeletal anomalies or variations in one or both treated groups when compared to non - treated controls .
The percentage of male fetuses was lower ( 41 % vs . 51 % ) and the post - implantation losses were increased ( 15 % vs . 8 % ) in the group given 0 . 15 mg / kg once daily when compared to the controls ; the mean numbers of implants ( 6 . 5 vs . 4 . 4 ) and normal live fetuses ( 5 . 4 vs . 3 . 8 ) were greater in this group when compared to the control group .
Labor and Delivery : It is not known whether muscle relaxants administered during vaginal delivery have immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus or increase the likelihood that resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary .
The possibility that forceps delivery will be necessary may increase .
Atracurium besylate ( 0 . 3 mg / kg ) has been administered to 26 pregnant women during delivery by cesarean section .
No harmful effects were attributable to atracurium in any of the neonates , although small amounts of atracurium were shown to cross the placental barrier .
The possibility of respiratory depression in the neonate should always be considered following cesarean section during which a neuromuscular blocking agent has been administered .
In patients receiving magnesium sulfate , the reversal of neuromuscular block may be unsatisfactory and the dose of atracurium besylate should be lowered as indicated .
Nursing Mothers : It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when atracurium besylate is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use : Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 1 month have not been established .
Geriatric Use : Since marketing in 1983 , uncontrolled clinical experience and limited data from controlled trials have not identified differences in effectiveness , safety , or dosage requirements between healthy elderly and younger patients ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ) ; however , as with other neuromuscular blocking agents , the use of a peripheral nerve stimulater to monitor neuromuscular function is suggested ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Observed in Controlled Clinical Studies : Atracurium was well tolerated and produced few adverse reactions during extensive clinical trials .
Most adverse reactions were suggestive of histamine release .
In studies including 875 patients , atracurium was discontinued in only one patient ( who required treatment for bronchial secretions ) and six other patients required treatment for adverse reactions attributable to atracurium ( wheezing in one , hypotension in five ) .
Of the five patients who required treatment for hypotension , three had a history of significant cardiovascular disease .
The overall incidence rate for clinically important adverse reactions , therefore , was 7 / 875 or 0 . 8 % .
Table 1 includes all adverse reaction reported attributable to atracurium during clinical trials with 875 patients .

Observed in Clinical Practice : Based on initial clinical practice experience in approximately 3 million patients who received atracurium in the U . S . and in the United Kingdom , spontaneously reported adverse reactions were uncommon ( approximately 0 . 01 % to 0 . 02 % ) .
The following adverse reactions are among the most frequently reported , but there are insufficient data to support an estimate of their incidence : General : Allergic reactions ( anaphylactic or anaphylactoid responses ) which , in rare instances , were severe ( e . g . , cardiac arrest ) Musculoskeletal : Inadequate block , prolonged block Cardiovascular : Hypotension , vasodilatation ( flushing ) , tachycardia , bradycardia Respiratory : Dyspnea , bronchospasm , laryngospasm Integumentary : Rash , urticaria , reaction at injection site There have been rare spontaneous reports of seizures in ICU patients following long - term infusion of atracurium to support mechanical ventilation .
There are insufficient data to define the contribution , if any , of atracurium and / or its metabolite laudanosine ( See PRECAUTIONS : Long - Term Use in Intensive Care Unit [ ICU ] ) .
There have been post - marketing reports of severe allergic reactions ( anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions ) associated with use of neuromuscular blocking agents , including atracurium besylate .
These reactions , in some cases , have been life - threatening and fatal .
Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency ( see WARNINGSand PRECAUTIONS ) .
OVERDOSAGE There has been limited experience with overdosage of atracurium besylate .
The possibility of iatrogenic overdosage can be minimized by carefully monitoring muscle twitch response to peripheral nerve stimulation .
Excessive doses of atracurium can be expected to produce enhanced pharmacological effects .
Overdosage may increase the risk of histamine release and cardiovascular effects , especially hypotension .
If cardiovascular support is necessary , this should include proper positioning , fluid administration , and the use of vasopressor agents if necessary .
The patient ’ s airway should be assured , with manual or mechanical ventilation maintained as necessary .
A longer duration of neuromuscular block may result from overdosage and a peripheral nerve stimulator should be used to monitor recovery .
Recovery may be facilitated by administration of an anticholinesterase reversing agent such as neostigmine , edrophonium , or pyridostigmine , in conjunction with an anticholinergic agent such as atropine or glycopyrrolate .
The appropriate package inserts should be consulted for prescribing information .
Three pediatric patients ( 3 weeks , 4 and 5 months of age ) unintentionally received doses of 0 . 8 mg / kg to 1 mg / kg of atracurium besylate .
The time to 25 % recovery ( 50 to 55 minutes ) following these doses , which were 5 to 6 times the ED95 dose , was moderately longer than the corresponding time observed following doses 2 to 2 . 5 times the atracurium ED95 dose in infants ( 22 to 36 minutes ) .
Cardiovascular changes were minimal .
Nonetheless the possibility of cardiovascular changes must be considered in the case of overdose .
An adult patient ( 17 years of age ) unintentionally received an initial dose of 1 . 3 mg / kg of atracurium besylate .
The time from injection to 25 % recovery ( 83 minutes ) was approximately twice that observed following maximum recommended doses in adults ( 35 to 45 minutes ) .
The patient experienced moderate hemodynamic changes ( 13 % increase in mean arterial pressure and 27 % increase in heart rate ) which persisted for 40 minutes and did not require treatment .
The intravenous LD50s determined in non - ventilated male and female albino mice and male Wistar rats were 1 . 9 , 2 . 01 and 1 . 31 mg / kg , respectively .
Deaths occurred within 2 minutes and were caused by respiratory paralysis .
The subcutaneous LD50 determined in non - ventilated male Wistar rats was 282 . 8 mg / kg .
Tremors , ptosis , loss of reflexes and respiratory failure preceded death which occurred 45 to 120 minutes after injection .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION To avoid distress to the patient , atracurium should not be administered before unconsciousness has been induced .
Atracurium should not be mixed in the same syringe , or administered simultaneously through the same needle , with alkaline solutions ( e . g . , barbiturate solutions ) .
Atracurium besylate should be administered intravenously .
DO NOT GIVE ATRACURIUM BESYLATE BY INTRAMUSCULAR ADMINISTRATION .
Intramuscular administration of atracurium besylate may result in tissue irritation and there are no clinical data to support this route of administration .
As with other neuromuscular blocking agents , the use of a peripheral nerve stimulator will permit the most advantageous use of atracurium besylate , minimizing the possibility of overdosage or underdosage , and assist in the evaluation of recovery .
Bolus Doses for Intubation and Maintenance of Neuromuscular Block : Adults : An atracurium besylate dose of 0 . 4 to 0 . 5 mg / kg ( 1 . 7 to 2 . 2 times the ED95 ) , given as an intravenous bolus injection , is the recommended initial dose for most patients .
With this dose , good or excellent conditions for nonemergency intubation can be expected in 2 to 2 . 5 minutes in most patients , with maximum neuromuscular block achieved approximately 3 to 5 minutes after injection .
Clinically required neuromuscular block generally lasts 20 to 35 minutes under balanced anesthesia .
Under balanced anesthesia , recovery to 25 % of control is achieved approximately 35 to 45 minutes after injection , and recovery is usually 95 % complete approximately 60 minutes after injection .
Atracurium is potentiated by isoflurane or enflurane anesthesia .
The same initial atracurium besylate dose of 0 . 4 to 0 . 5 mg / kg may be used for intubation prior to administration of these inhalation agents ; however , if atracurium is first administered under steady - state of isoflurane or enflurane , the initial atracurium besylate dose should be reduced by approximately one - third , i . e . , to 0 . 25 to 0 . 35 mg / kg , to adjust for the potentiating effects of these anesthetic agents .
With halothane , which has only a marginal ( approximately 20 % ) potentiating effect on atracurium , smaller dosage reductions may be considered .
Atracurium besylate doses of 0 . 08 to 0 . 10 mg / kg are recommended for maintenance of neuromuscular block during prolonged surgical procedures .
The first maintenance dose will generally be required 20 to 45 minutes after the initial atracurium besylate injection , but the need for maintenance doses should be determined by clinical criteria .
Because atracurium lacks cumulative effects , maintenance doses may be administered at relatively regular intervals for each patient , ranging approximately from 15 to 25 minutes under balanced anesthesia , slightly longer under isoflurane or enflurane .
Higher atracurium doses ( up to 0 . 2 mg / kg ) permit maintenance dosing at longer intervals .
Pediatric Patients : No atracurium dosage adjustments are required for pediatric patients two years of age or older .
An atracurium besylate dose of 0 . 3 to 0 . 4 mg / kg is recommended as the initial dose for infants ( 1 month to 2 years of age ) under halothane anesthesia .
Maintenance doses may be required with slightly greater frequency in infants and children than in adults .
Special Considerations : An initial atracurium besylate dose of 0 . 3 to 0 . 4 mg / kg , given slowly or in divided doses over one minute , is recommended for adults , children , or infants with significant cardiovascular disease and for adults , children , or infants with any history ( e . g . , severe anaphylactoid reactions or asthma ) suggesting a greater risk of histamine release .
Dosage reductions must be considered also in patients with neuromuscular disease , severe electrolyte disorders , or carcinomatosis in which potentiation of neuromuscular block or difficulties with reversal have been demonstrated .
There has been no clinical experience with atracurium in these patients , and no specific dosage adjustments can be recommended .
No atracurium dosage adjustments are required for patients with renal disease .
An initial atracurium besylate dose of 0 . 3 to 0 . 4 mg / kg is recommended for adults following the use of succinylcholine for intubation under balanced anesthesia .
Further reductions may be desirable with the use of potent inhalation anesthetics .
The patient should be permitted to recover from the effects of succinylcholine prior to atracurium administration .
Insufficient data are available for recommendation of a specific initial atracurium dose for administration following the use of succinylcholine in children and infants .
Use by Continuous Infusion : Infusion in the Operating Room ( OR ) : After administration of a recommended initial bolus dose of atracurium besylate injection ( 0 . 3 to 0 . 5 mg / kg ) , a diluted solution of atracurium besylate can be administered by continuous infusion to adults and pediatric patients aged 2 or more years for maintenance of neuromuscular block during extended surgical procedures .
Infusion of atracurium should be individualized for each patient .
The rate of administration should be adjusted according to the patient ’ s response as determined by peripheral nerve stimulation .
Accurate dosing is best achieved using a precision infusion device .
Infusion of atracurium should be initiated only after early evidence of spontaneous recovery from the bolus dose .
An initial infusion rate of 9 to 10 mcg / kg / min may be required to rapidly counteract the spontaneous recovery of neuromuscular function .
Thereafter , a rate of 5 to 9 mcg / kg / min should be adequate to maintain continuous neuromuscular block in the range of 89 % to 99 % in most pediatric and adult patients under balanced anesthesia .
Occasional patients may require infusion rates as low as 2 mcg / kg / min or as high as 15 mcg / kg / min .
The neuromuscular blocking effect of atracurium administered by infusion is potentiated by enflurane or isoflurane and , to a lesser extent , by halothane .
Reduction in the infusion rate of atracurium should , therefore , be considered for patients receiving inhalation anesthesia .
The rate of atracurium infusion should be reduced by approximately one - third in the presence of steady - state enflurane or isoflurane anesthesia ; smaller reductions should be considered in the presence of halothane .
In patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass with induced hypothermia , the rate of infusion of atracurium required to maintain adequate surgical relaxation during hypothermia ( 25 ° to 28 ° C ) has been shown to be approximately half the rate required during normothermia .
Spontaneous recovery from neuromuscular block following discontinuation of atracurium infusion may be expected to proceed at a rate comparable to that following administration of a single bolus dose .
Infusion in the Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) : The principles for infusion of atracurium in the OR are also applicable to use in the ICU .
An infusion rate of 11 to 13 mcg / kg / min ( range : 4 . 5 to 29 . 5 ) should provide adequate neuromuscular block in adult patients in an ICU .
Limited information suggests that infusion rates required for pediatric patients in the ICU may be higher than in adult patients .
There may be wide interpatient variability in dosage requirements and these requirements may increase or decrease with time ( see PRECAUTIONS : Long - Term Use in Intensive Care Unit [ ICU ] ) .
Following recovery from neuromuscular block , readministration of a bolus dose may be necessary to quickly reestablish neuromuscular block prior to reinstitution of the infusion .
Infusion Rate Tables : The amount of infusion solution required per minute will depend upon the concentration of atracurium in the infusion solution , the desired dose of atracurium , and the patient ’ s weight .
The following tables provide guidelines for delivery , in mL / hr ( equivalent to microdrops / min when 60 microdrops = 1 mL ) , of atracurium solutions in concentrations of 0 . 2 mg / mL ( 20 mg in 100 mL ) or 0 . 5 mg / mL ( 50 mg in 100 mL ) with an infusion pump or a gravity flow device .

Infusion solutions should be used within 24 hours of preparation .
Unused solutions should be discarded .
Solutions containing 0 . 2 mg / mL or 0 . 5 mg / mL atracurium besylate in the above diluents may be stored either under refrigeration or at room temperature for 24 hours without significant loss of potency .
Care should be taken during admixture to prevent inadvertent contamination .
Visually inspect prior to administration .
Spontaneous degradation of atracurium besylate has been demonstrated to occur more rapidly in Lactated Ringer ’ s solution than in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride solution .
Therefore , it is recommended that Lactated Ringer ’ s Injection not be used as a diluent in preparing solutions of atracurium besylate injection for infusion .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
Risk of Medication Errors : Accidental administration of neuromuscular blocking agents may be fatal .
Store atracurium besylate with the cap and ferrule intact and in a manner that minimizes the possibility of selecting the wrong product .
