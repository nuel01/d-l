6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In a vehicle ( placebo ) - controlled clinical trial of 463 pregnant women at risk for spontaneous preterm delivery based on obstetrical history , 310 received 250 mg of hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection and 153 received a vehicle formulation containing no drug by a weekly intramuscular injection beginning at 16 to 20 weeks of gestation and continuing until 37 weeks of gestation or delivery , whichever occurred first .
[ See Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) . ]
Certain pregnancy - related fetal and maternal complications or events were numerically increased in the hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection - treated subjects as compared to control subjects , including miscarriage and stillbirth , admission for preterm labor , preeclampsia or gestational hypertension , gestational diabetes , and oligohydramnios ( Tables 1 and 2 ) .

The most common adverse reactions that led to discontinuation in both groups were urticaria and injection site pain / swelling ( 1 % each ) .
Pulmonary embolus in one subject and injection site cellulitis in another subject were reported as serious adverse reactions in hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection - treated subjects .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Body as a whole : Local injection site reactions ( including erythema , urticaria , rash , irritation , hypersensitivity , warmth ) ; fatigue ; fever ; hot flashes / flushes • Digestive disorders : Vomiting • Infections : Urinary tract infection • Nervous system disorders : Headache , dizziness • Pregnancy , puerperium and perinatal conditions : Cervical incompetence , premature rupture of membranes • Reproductive system and breast disorders : Cervical dilation , shortened cervix • Respiratory disorders : Dyspnea , chest discomfort • Skin : Rash 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro drug - drug interaction studies were conducted with hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection .
Hydroxyprogesterone caproate has minimal potential for CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , and CYP2B6 related drug - drug interactions at the clinically relevant concentrations .
In vitro data indicated that therapeutic concentration of hydroxyprogesterone caproate is not likely to inhibit the activity of CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 , and CYP3A4 [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) . ]
No in vivo drug - drug interaction studies were conducted with hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection is indicated to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women with a singleton pregnancy who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth .
Fetal , neonatal , and maternal risks are discussed throughout labeling .
Data from the placebo - controlled clinical trial and the infant follow - up safety study [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 , 14 . 2 ) ] did not show a difference in adverse developmental outcomes between children of hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection - treated women and children of control subjects .
However , these data are insufficient to determine a drug - associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes as none of the hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection - treated women received the drug during the first trimester of pregnancy .
In animal reproduction studies , intramuscular administration of hydroxyprogesterone caproate to pregnant rats during gestation at doses 5 times the human dose equivalent based on a 60 - kg human was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Reproduction studies of hydroxyprogesterone caproate administered to various animal species have been reported in the literature .
In nonhuman primates , embryolethality was reported in rhesus monkeys administered hydroxyprogesterone caproate up to 2 . 4 and 24 times the human dose equivalent , but not in cynomolgus monkeys administered hydroxyprogesterone caproate at doses up to 2 . 4 times the human dose equivalent , every 7 days between days 20 and 146 of gestation .
There were no teratogenic effects in either strain of monkey .
Reproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 95 and 5 , respectively , times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to hydroxyprogesterone caproate .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Low levels of progestins are present in human milk with the use of progestin - containing products , including hydroxyprogesterone caproate .
Published studies have reported no adverse effects of progestins on the breastfed child or on milk production .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection is not indicated for use in women under 16 years of age .
Safety and effectiveness in patients less than 16 years of age have not been established .
A small number of women under age 18 years were studied ; safety and efficacy are expected to be the same in women aged 16 years and above as for users 18 years and older [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment No studies have been conducted to examine the pharmacokinetics of hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection in patients with hepatic impairment .
Hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection is extensively metabolized and hepatic impairment may reduce the elimination of hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection .
10 OVERDOSAGE There have been no reports of adverse events associated with overdosage of hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection in clinical trials .
In the case of overdosage , the patient should be treated symptomatically .
11 DESCRIPTION The active pharmaceutical ingredient in hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection is hydroxyprogesterone caproate , a progestin .
The chemical name for hydroxyprogesterone caproate is pregn - 4 - ene - 3 , 20 - dione , 17 [ ( 1 - oxohexyl ) oxy ] .
It has an empirical formula of C 27 H 40 O 4 and a molecular weight of 428 . 60 .
Hydroxyprogesterone caproate exists as white to practically white crystals or powder with a melting point of 120 ° C to 124 ° C .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection is a clear , yellow , sterile , non - pyrogenic solution for intramuscular injection .
Each 1 mL single - dose vial contains hydroxyprogesterone caproate , 250 mg / mL ( 25 % w / v ) , in a preservative - free solution containing castor oil ( 30 . 6 % v / v ) and benzyl benzoate ( 46 % v / v ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is a synthetic progestin .
The mechanism by which hydroxyprogesterone caproate reduces the risk of recurrent preterm birth is not known .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption : Female patients with a singleton pregnancy received intramuscular doses of 250 mg hydroxyprogesterone caproate for the reduction of preterm birth starting between 16 weeks 0 days and 20 weeks 6 days .
All patients had blood drawn daily for 7 days to evaluate pharmacokinetics .
Table 4 Summary of Mean ( Standard Deviation ) Pharmacokinetics Parameters for Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate Group ( N ) C max ( ng / mL ) T max ( days ) a AUC ( 1 to t ) b ( ng • hr / mL ) Group 1 ( N = 6 ) 5 . 0 ( 1 . 5 ) 5 . 5 ( 2 . 0 to 7 . 0 ) 571 . 4 ( 195 . 2 ) Group 2 ( N = 8 ) 12 . 5 ( 3 . 9 ) 1 . 0 ( 0 . 9 to 1 . 9 ) 1269 . 6 ( 285 . 0 ) Group 3 ( N = 11 ) 12 . 3 ( 4 . 9 ) 2 . 0 ( 1 . 0 to 3 . 0 ) 1268 . 0 ( 511 . 6 ) Blood was drawn daily for 7 days ( 1 ) starting 24 hours after the first dose between Weeks 16 to 20 ( Group 1 ) , ( 2 ) after a dose between Weeks 24 to 28 ( Group 2 ) , or ( 3 ) after a dose between Weeks 32 to 36 ( Group 3 ) aReported as median ( range ) bt = 7 days For all three groups , peak concentration ( C max ) and area under the curve ( AUC ( 1 to 7 days ) ) of the mono - hydroxylated metabolites were approximately 3 to 8 - fold lower than the respective parameters for the parent drug , hydroxyprogesterone caproate .
While di - hydroxylated and tri - hydroxylated metabolites were also detected in human plasma to a lesser extent , no meaningful quantitative results could be derived due to the absence of reference standards for these multiple hydroxylated metabolites .
The relative activity and significance of these metabolites are not known .
The elimination half - life of hydroxyprogesterone caproate , as evaluated from 4 patients in the study who reached full - term in their pregnancies , was 16 . 4 ( + 3 . 6 ) days .
The elimination half - life of the mono - hydroxylated metabolites was 19 . 7 ( + 6 . 2 ) days .
In a single - dose , open - label , randomized , parallel design bioavailability study in 120 healthy post - menopausal women , comparable systemic exposure of hydroxyprogesterone caproate was seen when hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection was dosed intramuscularly ( 1 mL ) in the upper outer quadrant of the gluteus maximus .
Distribution : Hydroxyprogesterone caproate binds extensively to plasma proteins including albumin and corticosteroid binding globulins .
Metabolism : In vitro studies have shown that hydroxyprogesterone caproate can be metabolized by human hepatocytes , both by phase I and phase II reactions .
Hydroxyprogesterone caproate undergoes extensive reduction , hydroxylation and conjugation .
The conjugated metabolites include sulfated , glucuronidated and acetylated products .
In vitro data indicate that the metabolism of hydroxyprogesterone caproate is predominantly mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 .
The in vitro data indicate that the caproate group is retained during metabolism of hydroxyprogesterone caproate .
Excretion : Both conjugated metabolites and free steroids are excreted in the urine and feces , with the conjugated metabolites being prominent .
Following intramuscular administration to pregnant women at 10 to 12 weeks gestation , approximately 50 % of a dose was recovered in the feces and approximately 30 % recovered in the urine .
Drug Interactions Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes : An in vitro inhibition study using human liver microsomes and CYP isoform - selective substrates indicated that hydroxyprogesterone caproate increased the metabolic rate of CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , and CYP2B6 by approximately 80 % , 150 % , and 80 % , respectively .
However , in another in vitro study using human hepatocytes under conditions where the prototypical inducers or inhibitors caused the anticipated increases or decreases in CYP enzyme activities , hydroxyprogesterone caproate did not induce or inhibit CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , or CYP2B6 activity .
Overall , the findings indicate that hydroxyprogesterone caproate has minimal potential for CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , and CYP2B6 related drug - drug interactions at the clinically relevant concentrations .
In vitro data indicated that therapeutic concentration of hydroxyprogesterone caproate is not likely to inhibit the activity of CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 , and CYP3A4 .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility Hydroxyprogesterone caproate has not been adequately evaluated for carcinogenicity .
No reproductive or developmental toxicity or impaired fertility was observed in a multigenerational study in rats .
Hydroxyprogesterone caproate administered intramuscularly , at gestational exposures up to 5 times the recommended human dose , had no adverse effects on the parental ( F 0 ) dams , their developing offspring ( F 1 ) , or the latter offspring ' s ability to produce a viable , normal second ( F 2 ) generation .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Clinical Trial to Evaluate Reduction of Risk of Preterm Birth In a multicenter , randomized , double - blind , vehicle ( placebo ) - controlled clinical trial , the safety and effectiveness of hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection for the reduction of the risk of spontaneous preterm birth was studied in women with a singleton pregnancy ( age 16 to 43 years ) who had a documented history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth ( defined as delivery at less than 37 weeks of gestation following spontaneous preterm labor or premature rupture of membranes ) .
At the time of randomization ( between 16 weeks , 0 days and 20 weeks , 6 days of gestation ) , an ultrasound examination had confirmed gestational age and no known fetal anomaly .
Women were excluded for prior progesterone treatment or heparin therapy during the current pregnancy , a history of thromboembolic disease , or maternal / obstetrical complications ( such as current or planned cerclage , hypertension requiring medication , or a seizure disorder ) .
A total of 463 pregnant women were randomized to receive either hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection ( N = 310 ) or vehicle ( N = 153 ) at a dose of 250 mg administered weekly by intramuscular injection starting between 16 weeks , 0 days and 20 weeks , 6 days of gestation , and continuing until 37 weeks of gestation or delivery .
Demographics of the hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection - treated women were similar to those in the control group , and included : 59 . 0 % Black , 25 . 5 % Caucasian , 13 . 9 % Hispanic and 0 . 6 % Asian .
The mean body mass index was 26 . 9 kg / m 2 .
The proportions of women in each treatment arm who delivered at < 37 ( the primary study endpoint ) , < 35 , and < 32 weeks of gestation are displayed in Table 5 .
Table 5 Proportion of Subjects Delivering at < 37 , < 35 and < 32 Weeks Gestational Age ( ITT Population ) Delivery Outcome Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate Injection 1 ( N = 310 ) % Control ( N = 153 ) % Treatment difference and 95 % Confidence Interval 2 < 37 weeks 37 . 1 54 . 9 - 17 . 8 % [ - 28 . 0 % , - 7 . 4 % ] < 35 weeks 21 . 3 30 . 7 - 9 . 4 % [ - 19 . 0 % , - 0 . 4 % ] < 32 weeks 11 . 9 19 . 6 - 7 . 7 % [ - 16 . 1 % , - 0 . 3 % ] 1 Four hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection - treated subjects were lost to follow - up .
They were counted as deliveries at their gestational ages at time of last contact ( 18 4 , 22 0 , 34 3 and 36 4 weeks ) .
2 Adjusted for interim analysis .
Compared to controls , treatment with hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection reduced the proportion of women who delivered preterm at < 37 weeks .
The proportions of women delivering at < 35 and < 32 weeks also were lower among women treated with hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection .
The upper bounds of the confidence intervals for the treatment difference at < 35 and < 32 weeks were close to zero .
Inclusion of zero in a confidence interval would indicate the treatment difference is not statistically significant .
Compared to the other gestational ages evaluated , the number of preterm births at < 32 weeks was limited .
After adjusting for time in the study , 7 . 5 % of hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection - treated subjects delivered prior to 25 weeks compared to 4 . 7 % of control subjects ; see Figure 1 .
Figure 1 Proportion of Women Remaining Pregnant as a Function of Gestational Age [ MULTIMEDIA ] The rates of fetal losses and neonatal deaths in each treatment arm are displayed in Table 6 .
Due to the higher rate of miscarriages and stillbirths in the hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection arm , there was no overall survival difference demonstrated in this clinical trial .
Table 6 Fetal Losses and Neonatal Deaths Complication Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate Injection N = 306 A n ( % ) B Control N = 153 n ( % ) B Miscarriages < 20 weeks gestation C 5 ( 2 . 4 ) 0 Stillbirth 6 ( 2 . 0 ) 2 ( 1 . 3 ) Antepartum stillbirth 5 ( 1 . 6 ) 1 ( 0 . 6 ) Intrapartum stillbirth 1 ( 0 . 3 ) 1 ( 0 . 6 ) Neonatal deaths 8 ( 2 . 6 ) 9 ( 5 . 9 ) Total Deaths 19 ( 6 . 2 ) 11 ( 7 . 2 ) A Four of the 310 hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection - treated subjects were lost to follow - up and stillbirth or neonatal status could not be determined B Percentages are based on the number of enrolled subjects and not adjusted for time on drug C Percentage adjusted for the number of at risk subjects ( n = 209 for hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection , n = 107 for control ) enrolled at < 20 weeks gestation .
A composite neonatal morbidity / mortality index evaluated adverse outcomes in livebirths .
It was based on the number of neonates who died or experienced respiratory distress syndrome , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage , proven sepsis , or necrotizing enterocolitis .
Although the proportion of neonates who experienced 1 or more events was numerically lower in the hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection arm ( 11 . 9 % vs . 17 . 2 % ) , the number of adverse outcomes was limited and the difference between arms was not statistically significant .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Infant Follow - Up Safety Study Infants born to women enrolled in this study , and who survived to be discharged from the nursery , were eligible for participation in a follow - up safety study .
Of 348 eligible offspring , 79 . 9 % enrolled : 194 children of hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection - treated women and 84 children of control subjects .
The primary endpoint was the score on the Ages & Stages Questionnaire ( ASQ ) , which evaluates communication , gross motor , fine motor , problem solving , and personal / social parameters .
The proportion of children whose scores met the screening threshold for developmental delay in each developmental domain was similar for each treatment group .
