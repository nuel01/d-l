Dear Medical Professional , Per your order , we have compounded Stannous - Pyrophosphate as a sterile lyophilized powder .
The characteristics of this preparation are : DESCRIPTION AnazaoHealth compounds Stannous - Pyrophosphate as a sterile lyophilized powder for the preparation of Tc99m Pyrophosphate .
Each 10 ml reaction vial contains : 27 . 6 milligrams sodium pyrophosphate decahydrate , 3 . 5 milligrams stannous chloride , all lyophilized under an atmosphere of nitrogen .
Prior to lyophilization the pH is adjusted with hydrochloric acid .
The pH of the reconstituted drug is between 4 . 5 and 7 . 5 .
No bacteriostatic preservative is present INDICATIONS AND USAGE Stannous Pyrophosphate is indicated as a blood pool imaging agent which may be used for gated pool imaging and for the detection of sites of gastrointestinal bleeding .
When administered intravenously , 15 - 30 minutes prior to intravenous administration of sodium pertechnetate Tc99m for in vivo red blood cell labeling , approximately 75 percent of the injected activity remains in the blood pool .
The modified in vivo / in vitro red blood cell labeling method may also be used for blood pool imaging .
It is also indicated as a skeletal imaging agent used to demonstrate areas of altered osteogenesis , and a cardiac imaging agent used as an adjunct in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended adult dose of Tc99m Pyrophosphate Injection is : • 5 to 15 mCi for skeletal imaging • 10 to 15 mCi for cardiac imaging • one - third ( 0 . 33 ) to the entire vial contents , followed 15 to 20 mCi of sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m , for blood pool imaging PACKAGE LABEL .
