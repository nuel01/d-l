( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) can cause reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency during and after withdrawal of the treatment .
Risk factor ( s ) are : use of high - potency topical corticosteroid , use over a large surface area or to areas under occlusion , prolonged use , altered skin barrier , liver failure , and young age .
Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop .
( 5 . 1 , 8 . 4 ) • Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity .
( 5 . 1 , 8 . 4 ) • The use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) in the treatment of diaper dermatitis is not recommended .
( 5 . 2 ) • Topical corticosteroid products may increase the risk of cataracts and glaucoma .
If visual symptoms occur , consider referral to an ophthalmologist .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Effects on Endocrine System Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) can cause reversible hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency .
This may occur during treatment or after withdrawal of treatment .
Cushing ' s syndrome and hyperglycemia may also occur due to the systemic effect of corticosteroids while on treatment .
Factors that predispose a patient to HPA axis suppression include the use of high - potency steroids , large treatment surface areas , prolonged use , use of occlusive dressing , altered skin barrier , liver failure , and young age .
Because of the potential for systemic corticosteroid effects , patients may need to be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression .
This may be done by using the adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) stimulation test .
In a small trial , clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) was applied using large dosages , 7 g daily for 14 days ( BID ) to the crural area of normal adult subjects .
Three of the 8 normal subjects on whom clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) was applied exhibited low morning plasma cortisol levels during treatment .
One of these subjects had an abnormal cosyntropin test .
The effect on morning plasma cortisol was transient and subjects recovered 1 week after discontinuing dosing .
In addition , 2 separate trials in pediatric subjects demonstrated adrenal suppression as determined by cosyntropin testing [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
If HPA axis suppression is documented , gradually withdraw the drug , reduce the frequency of application , or substitute with a less potent corticosteroid .
Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity due to their larger skin - surface - to - body mass ratios [ seeUse in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 2 Diaper Dermatitis The use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) in the treatment of diaper dermatitis is not recommended .
5 . 3 Ophthalmic Adverse Reactions Use of topical corticosteroids may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma .
Cataracts and glaucoma have been reported in postmarketing experience with the use of topical corticosteroid products , including topical betamethasone products [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Avoid contact of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) with eyes .
Advise patients to report any visual symptoms and consider referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions reported for clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) were paraesthesia in 1 . 9 % of patients and rash , edema , and secondary infections each in less than 1 % of patients .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Fougera Pharmaceuticals Inc . at 1 - 800 - 645 - 9833 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In clinical trials common adverse reaction reported for clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) was paresthesia in 1 . 9 % of patients .
Adverse reactions reported at a frequency < 1 % included rash , edema , and secondary infection .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Because adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
The following local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids : itching , irritation , dryness , folliculitis , hypertrichosis , acneiform eruptions , hypopigmentation , perioral dermatitis , allergic contact dermatitis , maceration of the skin , skin atrophy , striae , miliaria , capillary fragility ( ecchymoses ) , telangiectasia , and sensitization ( local reactions upon repeated application of product ) .
Ophthalmic adverse reactions of blurred vision , cataracts , glaucoma , increased intraocular pressure , and central serous chorioretinopathy have been reported with the use of topical corticosteroids , including topical betamethasone products .
Adverse reactions reported with the use of clotrimazole are : erythema , stinging , blistering , peeling , edema , pruritus , urticaria , and general irritation of the skin .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on topical betamethasone dipropionate or clotrimazole use in pregnant women to identify a clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Observational studies suggest an increased risk of low birthweight infants with the use of potent or very potent topical corticosteroid during pregnancy .
Advise pregnant women that clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) may increase the risk of having a low birthweight infant and to use clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible .
There have been no reproduction studies performed in animals or humans with the combination of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate .
In an animal reproduction study , betamethasone dipropionate caused malformations ( i . e . , umbilical hernias , cephalocele , and cleft palate ) in pregnant rabbits when given by the intramuscular route during organogenesis [ see Data ] .
The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposure of clotrimazole and / or betamethasone dipropionate observed in the animal studies to the systemic exposure that would be expected in humans after topical use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) .
• The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Clotrimazole Studies in pregnant rats treated during organogenesis with intravaginal doses up to 100 mg / kg / day revealed no evidence of fetotoxicity due to clotrimazole exposure .
No increase in fetal malformations was noted in pregnant rats receiving oral ( gastric tube ) clotrimazole doses up to 100 mg / kg / day during gestation Days 6 to 15 .
However , clotrimazole dosed at 100 mg / kg / day was embryotoxic ( increased resorptions ) , fetotoxic ( reduced fetal weights ) , and maternally toxic ( reduced body weight gain ) to rats .
Clotrimazole dosed at 200 mg / kg / day was maternally lethal , and therefore , fetuses were not evaluated in this group .
Also in this study , doses up to 50 mg / kg / day had no adverse effects on dams or fetuses .
However , in the combined fertility , embryofetal development , and postnatal development study conducted in rats , 50 mg / kg / day clotrimazole was associated with reduced maternal weight gain and reduced numbers of offspring reared to 4 weeks [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Oral clotrimazole doses of 25 , 50 , 100 , and 200 mg / kg / day did not cause malformations in pregnant mice .
No evidence of maternal toxicity or embryotoxicity was seen in pregnant rabbits dosed orally during organogenesis with 60 , 120 , or 180 mg / kg / day .
Betamethasone Dipropionate Betamethasone dipropionate caused malformations when given to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis by the intramuscular route at doses of 0 . 05 mg / kg / day .
The abnormalities observed included umbilical hernias , cephalocele , and cleft palates .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data regarding the excretion of betamethasone dipropionate or clotrimazole into breast milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production after topical application to women who are breastfeeding .
It is possible that topical administration of betamethasone dipropionate could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breast milk , use clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding .
Advise breastfeeding women not to apply clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) in patients under 17 years of age is not recommended .
Adverse events consistent with corticosteroid use have been observed in pediatric patients treated with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) .
In open - label trials , 17 of 43 ( 39 . 5 % ) evaluable pediatric subjects ( aged 12 to 16 years old ) using clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) for treatment of tinea pedis demonstrated adrenal suppression as determined by cosyntropin testing .
In another open - label trial , 8 of 17 ( 47 . 1 % ) evaluable pediatric subjects ( aged 12 to 16 years old ) using clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) for treatment of tinea cruris demonstrated adrenal suppression as determined by cosyntropin testing .
Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass , pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression when they are treated with topical corticosteroids .
They are , therefore also at greater risk of adrenal insufficiency during and / or after withdrawal of treatment .
Pediatric patients may be more susceptible than adults to skin atrophy , including striae , when they are treated with topical corticosteroids .
HPA axis suppression , Cushing ' s syndrome , linear growth retardation , delayed weight gain , and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Avoid use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) in the treatment of diaper dermatitis .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
However , greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
The use of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) under occlusion , such as in diaper dermatitis , is not recommended .
Postmarket adverse event reporting for clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) in patients aged 65 and above includes reports of skin atrophy and rare reports of skin ulceration .
Caution should be exercised with the use of these corticosteroid - containing topical products on thinning skin .
11 DESCRIPTION Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream USP , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) contains combinations of clotrimazole , an azole antifungal , and betamethasone dipropionate , a corticosteroid , for topical use .
Chemically , clotrimazole is 1 – ( o - chloro - α , α - diphenylbenzyl ) imidazole , with the molecular formula C 22 H 17 CLN 2 , a molecular weight of 344 . 84 , and the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Clotrimazole is an odorless , white crystalline powder , insoluble in water and soluble in ethanol .
Betamethasone dipropionate has 9 - fluoro - 11β , 17 , 21 - trihydroxy - 16β - methylpregna - 1 , 4 - diene - 3 , 20 - dione 17 , 21 - dipropionate , with the molecular formula C 28 H 37 FO 7 , a molecular weight of 504 . 59 , and the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Betamethasone dipropionate is a white to creamy - white , odorless crystalline powder , insoluble in water .
Each gram of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream USP , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) contains 10 mg clotrimazole , USP and 0 . 64 mg betamethasone dipropionate , USP ( equivalent to 0 . 5 mg betamethasone ) , in a hydrophilic cream consisting of purified water , mineral oil , white petrolatum , cetostearyl alcohol , ceteareth - 30 , propylene glycol , monobasic sodium phosphate monohydrate , and benzyl alcohol as a preservative .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Clotrimazole is an azole antifungal [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
Betamethasone dipropionate is a corticosteroid .
Corticosteroids play a role in cellular signaling , immune function , inflammation , and protein regulation ; however , the precise mechanism of action for the treatment of tinea pedis , tinea cruris and tinea corporis is unknown .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Vasoconstrictor Assay Studies performed with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) indicate that these topical combination antifungal / corticosteroids may have vasoconstrictor potencies in a range that is comparable to high - potency topical corticosteroids .
However , similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Skin penetration and systemic absorption of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate following topical application of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) has not been studied .
The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors , including the vehicle , the integrity of the epidermal barrier , and the use of occlusive dressings .
Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin .
Inflammation and / or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids .
Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Once absorbed through the skin , the pharmacokinetics of topical corticosteroids are similar to systemically administered corticosteroids .
Corticosteroids are bound to plasma proteins in varying degrees .
Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys .
Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Clotrimazole , an azole antifungal agent , inhibits 14 - α - demethylation of lanosterol in fungi by binding to one of the cytochrome P - 450 enzymes .
This leads to the accumulation of 14 - α - methylsterols and reduced concentrations of ergosterol , a sterol essential for a normal fungal cytoplasmic membrane .
The methylsterols may affect the electron transport system , thereby inhibiting growth of fungi .
Activity In Vitro and In Vivo Clotrimazole has been shown to be active against most strains of the following dermatophytes , both in vitro and in clinical infections , Epidermophyton floccosum , Trichophyton mentagrophytes , and Trichophyton rubrum [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
Drug Resistance Strains of dermatophytes having a natural resistance to clotrimazole have not been reported .
Resistance to azoles , including clotrimazole , has been reported in some Candida species .
No single - step or multiple - step resistance to clotrimazole has developed during successive passages of Trichophyton mentagrophytes .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of the combination of clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate or either component individually .
Betamethasone was negative in the bacterial mutagenicity assay ( Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli ) and in the mammalian cell mutagenicity assay ( CHO / HGPRT ) .
It was positive in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay , and equivocal in the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay .
In a combined study of the effects of clotrimazole on fertility , embryofetal development , and postnatal development , male and female rats were dosed orally ( diet admixture ) with dose levels of 5 , 10 , 25 , or 50 mg / kg / day from 10 weeks prior to mating until 4 weeks postpartum .
No adverse effects on the duration of estrous cycle , fertility , or duration of pregnancy were noted .
Reproductive studies with betamethasone dipropionate conducted in rabbits at doses of 1 . 0 mg / kg / day by the intramuscular route and in mice up to 33 mg / kg / day by the intramuscular route indicated no impairment of fertility except for dose - related increases in fetal resorption rates in both species .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES In clinical trials of tinea corporis , tinea cruris , and tinea pedis , subjects treated with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) showed a better clinical response at the first return visit than subjects treated with clotrimazole cream .
In tinea corporis and tinea cruris , the subject returned 3 to 5 days after starting treatment , and in tinea pedis , after 1 week .
Mycological cure rates observed in subjects treated with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) were as good as , or better than , in those subjects treated with clotrimazole cream .
In these same clinical studies , patients treated with clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream , 1 % / 0 . 05 % ( base ) showed better clinical responses and mycological cure rates when compared with subjects treated with betamethasone dipropionate cream .
