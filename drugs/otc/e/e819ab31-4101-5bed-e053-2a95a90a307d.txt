6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
The overall safety of fosaprepitant for injection was evaluated in approximately 1800 adult and pediatric patients .
Adverse Reactions in Adults for the Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with MEC In an active - controlled clinical trial in patients receiving MEC , safety was evaluated in 504 patients receiving a single dose of fosaprepitant for injection in combination with ondansetron and dexamethasone ( fosaprepitant for injection regimen ) compared to 497 patients receiving ondansetron and dexamethasone alone ( standard therapy ) .
The most common adverse reactions are listed in Table 6 .
Table 6 Most Common Adverse Reactions in Patients Receiving MEC * Fosaprepitant for injection , ondansetron , and dexamethasone † ( N = 504 ) Ondansetron and dexamethasone ‡ ( N = 497 ) fatigue 15 % 13 % diarrhea 13 % 11 % neutropenia 8 % 7 % asthenia 4 % 3 % anemia 3 % 2 % peripheral neuropathy 3 % 2 % leukopenia 2 % 1 % dyspepsia 2 % 1 % urinary tract infection 2 % 1 % pain in extremity 2 % 1 % * Reported in ≥ 2 % of patients treated with the fosaprepitant for injection regimen and at a greater incidence than standard therapy .
† Fosaprepitant for injection regimen ‡ Standard therapy Infusion - site reactions were reported in 2 . 2 % of patients treated with the fosaprepitant for injection regimen compared to 0 . 6 % of patients treated with standard therapy .
The infusion - site reactions included : infusion site pain ( 1 . 2 % , 0 . 4 % ) , injection - site irritation ( 0 . 2 % , 0 . 0 % ) , vessel puncture - site pain ( 0 . 2 % , 0 . 0 % ) , and infusion - site thrombophlebitis ( 0 . 6 % , 0 . 0 % ) , reported in the fosaprepitant for injection regimen compared to standard therapy , respectively .
Adverse Reactions in Adults for the Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with HEC In an active - controlled clinical study in patients receiving HEC , safety was evaluated for 1143 patients receiving a single dose of fosaprepitant for injection compared to 1169 patients receiving the 3 - day regimen of oral fosaprepitant ( aprepitant ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
The safety profile was generally similar to that seen in the MEC study with fosaprepitant and prior HEC studies with aprepitant .
However , infusion - site reactions occurred at a higher incidence in patients in the fosaprepitant group ( 3 . 0 % ) compared to those in the aprepitant group ( 0 . 5 % ) .
The following additional infusion - site reactions occurred in the HEC study and were not reported in the MEC study described above : infusion - site erythema ( 0 . 5 % , 0 . 1 % ) , infusion - site pruritus ( 0 . 3 % , 0 . 0 % ) , and infusion - site induration ( 0 . 2 % , 0 . 1 % ) , reported in the fosaprepitant group compared to the aprepitant group , respectively .
Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients 6 Months to 17 Years of Age for the Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with HEC or MEC Single - Dose Fosaprepitant for Injection Regimen The safety of a single dose of fosaprepitant for injection in pediatric patients ( 6 months to 17 years ) was evaluated in two active - controlled and a single - arm clinical study in patients who received either HEC or MEC .
Patients also received ondansetron with or without dexamethasone .
The adverse reaction profile was similar to adults .
The safety analysis included 69 pediatric patients who received the recommended dose .
An additional 70 patients received a single , higher - than - recommended dose .
The most common adverse reactions that occurred in > 15 % of patients who received the recommended dose were anemia , neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , and febrile neutropenia .
3 - Day Fosaprepitant Regimen In pediatric patients ( 12 to 17 years ) , the safety of the 3 - day IV / oral / oral fosaprepitant ( aprepitant ) regimen was evaluated in a single - arm clinical study including 12 patients who received a regimen of either HEC or MEC .
In pediatric patients 6 months to 12 years of age , the safety of the 3 - day IV / oral / oral fosaprepitant ( aprepitant ) regimen was not directly evaluated .
The safety of a single - dose of fosaprepitant for injection ( 3 mg / kg ) administered on day 1 of the 3 - day IV / oral / oral regimen was evaluated in one active - controlled and one single - arm study including 48 pediatric patients 6 months to 12 years of age who received a regimen of either HEC or MEC .
In these clinical studies , pediatric patients also received ondansetron with or without dexamethasone .
The adverse reaction profile in pediatric patients was similar to the profile in adult patients receiving a single dose of fosaprepitant for injection .
Because fosaprepitant is converted to aprepitant , those adverse reactions associated with aprepitant might also be expected to occur with fosaprepitant for injection .
See the full prescribing information for aprepitant capsules for complete safety information regarding studies performed with oral aprepitant .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of fosaprepitant for injection .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : pruritus , rash , urticaria , Stevens - Johnson syndrome / toxic epidermal necrolysis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Immune system disorders : hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Nervous system disorders : ifosfamide - induced neurotoxicity reported after fosaprepitant for injection and ifosfamide coadministration .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See Full Prescribing Information for a list of clinically significant drug interactions .
( 4 , 5 . 1 , 5 . 4 , 5 . 5 , 7 . 1 , 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Effect of Fosaprepitant / Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs When administered intravenously , fosaprepitant , a prodrug of aprepitant , is converted to aprepitant within 30 minutes .
Therefore , drug interactions following administration of fosaprepitant for injection are likely to occur with drugs that interact with oral aprepitant .
Fosaprepitant , given as a single 150 - mg dose , is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 , and the weak inhibition of CYP3A4 continues for 2 days after single dose administration .
Single dose fosaprepitant does not induce CYP3A4 .
Aprepitant is a substrate , an inhibitor , and an inducer of CYP3A4 .
Aprepitant is also an inducer of CYP2C9 [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Some substrates of CYP3A4 are contraindicated with fosaprepitant for injection [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Dosage adjustment of some CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 substrates may be warranted , as shown in Table 7 .
Table 7 Effects of Fosaprepitant / Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates Pimozide Clinical Impact Increased pimozide exposure Intervention Fosaprepitant for injection is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Benzodiazepines Clinical Impact Increased exposure to midazolam or other benzodiazepines metabolized via CYP3A4 ( alprazolam , triazolam ) may increase the risk of adverse reactions [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention Monitor for benzodiazepine - related adverse reactions .
Dexamethasone Clinical Impact Increased dexamethasone exposure [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention Reduce the dose of oral dexamethasone by approximately 50 % [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Methylprednisolone Clinical Impact Increased methylprednisolone exposure [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention Reduce the dose of oral methylprednisolone by approximately 50 % on Days 1 and 2 for patients receiving HEC and on Day 1 for patients receiving MEC .
Reduce the dose of intravenous methylprednisolone by 25 % on Days 1 and 2 for patients receiving HEC and on Day 1 for patients receiving MEC .
Chemotherapeutic agents that are metabolized by CYP3A4 Clinical Impact Increased exposure of the chemotherapeutic agent may increase the risk of adverse reactions [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention Vinblastine , vincristine , or ifosfamide or other chemotherapeutic agents • Monitor for chemotherapeutic - related adverse reactions .
Etoposide , vinorelbine , paclitaxel , and docetaxel • No dosage adjustment needed .
Hormonal Contraceptives Clinical Impact Decreased hormonal exposure during administration of and for 28 days after administration of the last dose of fosaprepitant for injection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention Effective alternative or back - up methods of contraception ( such as condoms and spermicides ) should be used during treatment with fosaprepitant for injection and for 1 month following administration of fosaprepitant for injection .
Examples birth control pills , skin patches , implants , and certain IUDs CYP2C9 Substrates Warfarin Clinical Impact Decreased warfarin exposure and decreased prothrombin time ( INR ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention In patients on chronic warfarin therapy , monitor the prothrombin time ( INR ) in the 2 - week period , particularly at 7 to 10 days , following administration of fosaprepitant for injection with each chemotherapy cycle .
Other 5 - HT 3 Antagonists Clinical Impact No change in the exposure of the 5 - HT 3 antagonist [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention No dosage adjustment needed Examples ondansetron , granisetron , dolasetron 7 . 2 Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Fosaprepitant / Aprepitant Aprepitant is a CYP3A4 substrate [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Co - administration of fosaprepitant for injection with drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 may result in increased or decreased plasma concentrations of aprepitant , respectively , as shown in Table 8 .
Table 8 Effects of Other Drugs on Pharmacokinetics of Fosaprepitant / Aprepitant Moderate to Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Clinical Impact Significantly increased exposure of aprepitant may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with fosaprepitant for injection [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention Avoid concomitant use of fosaprepitant for injection Examples Moderate inhibitor : diltiazem Strong inhibitors : ketoconazole , itraconazole , nefazodone , troleandomycin , clarithromycin , ritonavir , nelfinavir Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Clinical Impact Substantially decreased exposure of aprepitant in patients chronically taking a strong CYP3A4 inducer may decrease the efficacy of fosaprepitant for injection [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention Avoid concomitant use of fosaprepitant for injection Examples rifampin , carbamazepine , phenytoin 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient data on use of fosaprepitant for injection in pregnant women to inform a drug associated risk .
In animal reproduction studies , no adverse developmental effects were observed in rats or rabbits exposed during the period of organogenesis to systemic drug levels ( AUC ) approximately equivalent to the exposure at the recommended human dose ( RHD ) of 150 mg [ see Data ] .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits , aprepitant was administered during the period of organogenesis at oral doses up to 1000 mg / kg twice daily ( rats ) and up to the maximum tolerated dose of 25 mg / kg / day ( rabbits ) .
No embryofetal lethality or malformations were observed at any dose level in either species .
The exposures ( AUC ) in pregnant rats at 1000 mg / kg twice daily and in pregnant rabbits at 25 mg / kg / day were approximately equivalent to the exposure at the RHD of 150 mg .
Aprepitant crosses the placenta in rats and rabbits .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Lactation studies have not been conducted to assess the presence of aprepitant in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Aprepitant is present in rat milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for fosaprepitant for injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from fosaprepitant for injection or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Upon administration of fosaprepitant for injection , the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be reduced .
Advise females of reproductive potential using hormonal contraceptives to use an effective alternative or back - up non - hormonal contraceptive ( such as condoms and spermicides ) during treatment with fosaprepitant for injection and for 1 month following the last dose [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of a single dose and a 3 - day IV / oral / oral regimen have been established in pediatric patients 6 months to 17 years for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of HEC and MEC .
Use of fosaprepitant in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies of fosaprepitant for injection in adults , with additional safety , efficacy and pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients 6 months to 17 years .
Efficacy and safety were also supported by data from an adequate and well - controlled study of a 3 - day oral aprepitant regimen in pediatric patients 6 months to 17 years .
See the full prescribing information for aprepitant capsules for complete clinical information regarding studies performed with oral aprepitant .
Adverse reactions were similar to those reported in adult patients .
[ See Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of fosaprepitant for injection for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with HEC or MEC have not been established in patients less than 6 months of age .
Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In juvenile dogs treated with fosaprepitant , changes in reproductive organs were observed .
In juvenile rats treated with aprepitant , slight changes in sexual maturation were observed without an effect on reproduction .
No effects on neurobehavior , sensory and motor function , or learning and memory were observed in rats .
In a toxicity study in juvenile dogs treated with fosaprepitant from postnatal day 14 ( equivalent to a newborn human ) to day 42 ( approximately equivalent to a 2 year old human ) , decreased testicular weight and Leydig cell size were seen in the males at 6 mg / kg / day and increased uterine weight , hypertrophy of the uterus and cervix , and edema of vaginal tissues were seen in females from 4 mg / kg / day .
A study was also conducted in young rats to evaluate the effects of aprepitant on growth and on neurobehavioral and sexual development .
Rats were treated at oral doses up to the maximum feasible dose of 1000 mg / kg twice daily ( providing exposure in male and female rats lower than the exposure at the recommended pediatric human dose ) from the early postnatal period ( Postnatal Day 10 ( equivalent to a newborn human ) through Postnatal Day 58 ( approximately equivalent to a 15 year old human ) ) .
Slight changes in the onset of sexual maturation were observed in female and male rats ; however , there were no effects on mating , fertility , embryonic - fetal survival , or histomorphology of the reproductive organs .
There were no effects in neurobehavioral tests of sensory function , motor function , and learning and memory .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 1649 adult cancer patients treated with intravenous fosaprepitant for injection in HEC and MEC clinical studies , 27 % were aged 65 and over , while 5 % were aged 75 and over .
Other reported clinical experience with fosaprepitant for injection has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients .
In general , use caution when dosing elderly patients as they have a greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal or cardiac function and concomitant disease or other drug therapy [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of aprepitant in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those of healthy subjects with normal hepatic function .
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh score 5 to 9 ) .
There are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh score greater than 9 ) .
Therefore , additional monitoring for adverse reactions in these patients may be warranted when fosaprepitant for injection is administered [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no specific information on the treatment of overdosage with fosaprepitant or aprepitant .
In the event of overdose , fosaprepitant for injection should be discontinued and general supportive treatment and monitoring should be provided .
Because of the antiemetic activity of fosaprepitant for injection , drug - induced emesis may not be effective in cases of fosaprepitant for injection overdosage .
Aprepitant is not removed by hemodialysis .
11 DESCRIPTION Fosaprepitant for injection is a sterile , lyophilized formulation containing fosaprepitant dimeglumine , a prodrug of aprepitant , a substance P / neurokinin - 1 ( NK 1 ) receptor antagonist , an antiemetic agent , chemically described as 1 - Deoxy - 1 - ( methylamino ) - D - glucitol [ 3 - [ [ ( 2 R , 3 S ) - 2 - ( 1 R ) - 1 - [ 3 , 5 - bis ( trifluoromethyl ) phenyl ] ethoxy ] - 3 - ( 4 - fluorophenyl ) - 4 - morpholinyl ] methyl ] - 2 , 5 - dihydro - 5 - oxo - 1 H - 1 , 2 , 4 - triazol - 1 - yl ] phosphonate ( 2 : 1 ) .
Its empirical formula is C 23 H 22 F 7 N 4 O 6 P · 2 ( C 7 H 17 NO 5 ) and its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Fosaprepitant dimeglumine is a white or whitish hygroscopic powder with a molecular weight of 1004 . 83 .
It is freely soluble in water and methanol , practically insoluble in absolute ethanol .
Each vial of fosaprepitant for injection for administration as an intravenous infusion contains 150 mg of fosaprepitant ( equivalent to 245 . 3 mg of fosaprepitant dimeglumine ) and the following inactive ingredients : edetate disodium ( 5 . 4 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 75 mg ) , lactose anhydrous ( 375 mg ) , sodium hydroxide and / or hydrochloric acid ( for pH adjustment ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Fosaprepitant is a prodrug of aprepitant and accordingly , its antiemetic effects are attributable to aprepitant .
Aprepitant is a selective high - affinity antagonist of human substance P / neurokinin 1 ( NK 1 ) receptors .
Aprepitant has little or no affinity for serotonin ( 5 - HT 3 ) , dopamine , and corticosteroid receptors , the targets of existing therapies for chemotherapy - induced nausea and vomiting ( CINV ) .
Aprepitant has been shown in animal models to inhibit emesis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents , such as cisplatin , via central actions .
Animal and human Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) studies with aprepitant have shown that it crosses the blood brain barrier and occupies brain NK 1 receptors .
Animal and human studies have shown that aprepitant augments the antiemetic activity of the 5 - HT 3 - receptor antagonist ondansetron and the corticosteroid dexamethasone and inhibits both the acute and delayed phases of cisplatin - induced emesis .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized , double - blind , positive - controlled , thorough QTc study , a single 200 - mg dose of fosaprepitant ( approximately 1 . 3 times the recommended dose ) had no effect on the QTc interval .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Aprepitant after Fosaprepitant Administration Following administration of a single intravenous 150 - mg dose of fosaprepitant , a prodrug of aprepitant administered as a 20 - minute infusion to healthy subjects , the mean AUC 0 - ∞ of aprepitant was 37 . 4 ( ± 14 . 8 ) mcg • hr / mL and the mean maximal aprepitant concentration ( C max ) was 4 . 2 ( ± 1 . 2 ) mcg / mL .
Plasma concentrations of fosaprepitant are below the limits of quantification ( 10 ng / mL ) within 30 minutes of the completion of infusion .
Distribution Aprepitant is greater than 95 % bound to plasma proteins .
The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state ( Vd ss ) was approximately 70 L in humans .
Aprepitant crosses the blood brain barrier in humans [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
Elimination Metabolism Fosaprepitant is converted to aprepitant in in vitro incubations with human liver preparations and in S9 preparations from multiple other human tissues including kidney , lung and ileum .
Thus , it appears that the conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant can occur in multiple extrahepatic tissues in addition to the liver .
Aprepitant undergoes extensive metabolism .
In vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicate that aprepitant is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 with minor metabolism by CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 .
Metabolism is largely via oxidation at the morpholine ring and its side chains .
No metabolism by CYP2D6 , CYP2C9 , or CYP2E1 was detected .
In healthy young adults , aprepitant accounts for approximately 24 % of the radioactivity in plasma over 72 hours following a single oral 300 - mg dose of [ 14 C ] - aprepitant , indicating a substantial presence of metabolites in the plasma .
Seven metabolites of aprepitant , which are only weakly active , have been identified in human plasma .
Excretion Following administration of a single intravenous 100 - mg dose of [ 14 C ] - fosaprepitant to healthy subjects , 57 % of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and 45 % in feces .
Aprepitant is eliminated primarily by metabolism ; aprepitant is not renally excreted .
The apparent terminal half - life ranged from approximately 9 to 13 hours .
Specific Populations Age : Geriatric Population Following oral administration of a single 125 - mg dose of aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 through 5 , the AUC 0 - 24 hr of aprepitant was 21 % higher on Day 1 and 36 % higher on Day 5 in elderly ( 65 years and older ) relative to younger adults .
The C max was 10 % higher on Day 1 and 24 % higher on Day 5 in elderly relative to younger adults .
These differences are not considered clinically meaningful [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Age : Pediatric Population Single Dose Fosaprepitant for Injection Regimen : Simulated systemic exposures of aprepitant in patients 2 years to less than 12 years and observed systemic exposures in patients 6 months to less than 2 years and 12 to 17 years are shown in Table 9 , including AUC 0 - 24 hr , peak plasma concentration ( C max ) on Day 1 and concentrations at the end of Day 1 ( C 24 ) , Day 2 ( C 48 ) and Day 3 ( C 72 ) .

Plasma concentrations of fosaprepitant are negligible within 15 to 30 minutes after the completion of the infusion in pediatric patients .
Sex Following oral administration of a single dose of aprepitant , ranging from 40 mg to 375 mg , the AUC 0 - 24 hr and C max are 9 % and 17 % higher in females as compared with males .
The half - life of aprepitant is approximately 25 % lower in females as compared with males and T max occurs at approximately the same time .
These differences are not considered clinically meaningful .
A population pharmacokinetic analysis of aprepitant in pediatric patients ( 6 months to 17 years ) suggests that sex has no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant .
Race / Ethnicity Following oral administration of a single dose of aprepitant , ranging from 40 mg to 375 mg , the AUC 0 - 24 hr and C max are approximately 27 % and 19 % higher in Hispanics as compared with Caucasians .
The AUC 0 - 24 hr and C max were 74 % and 47 % higher in Asians as compared to Caucasians .
There was no difference in AUC 0 - 24 hr or C max between Caucasians and Blacks .
These differences are not considered clinically meaningful .
A population pharmacokinetic analysis of aprepitant in pediatric patients ( 6 months to 17 years ) suggests that race has no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant .
Renal Impairment A single 240 - mg oral dose of aprepitant was administered to patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance less than 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 as measured by 24 - hour urinary creatinine clearance ) and to patients with end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) requiring hemodialysis .
In patients with severe renal impairment , the AUC 0 - ∞ of total aprepitant ( unbound and protein bound ) decreased by 21 % and C max decreased by 32 % , relative to healthy subjects ( creatinine clearance greater than 80 mL / min estimated by Cockcroft - Gault method ) .
In patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis , the AUC 0 - ∞ of total aprepitant decreased by 42 % and Cmax decreased by 32 % .
Due to modest decreases in protein binding of aprepitant in patients with renal disease , the AUC of pharmacologically active unbound drug was not significantly affected in patients with renal impairment compared with healthy subjects .
Hemodialysis conducted 4 or 48 hours after dosing had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of aprepitant ; less than 0 . 2 % of the dose was recovered in the dialysate .
Hepatic Impairment Fosaprepitant is metabolized in various extrahepatic tissues ; therefore hepatic impairment is not expected to alter the conversion of fosaprepitant to aprepitant .
Following administration of a single 125 - mg oral dose of aprepitant on Day 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 and 3 to patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh score 5 to 6 ) , the AUC 0 - 24 hr of aprepitant was 11 % lower on Day 1 and 36 % lower on Day 3 , as compared with healthy subjects given the same regimen .
In patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh score 7 to 9 ) , the AUC 0 - 24 hr of aprepitant was 10 % higher on Day 1 and 18 % higher on Day 3 , as compared with healthy subjects given the same regimen .
These differences in AUC 0 - 24 hr are not considered clinically meaningful .
There are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh score greater than 9 ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Body Mass Index ( BMI ) For every 5 kg / m 2 increase in BMI , AUC 0 - 24 hr and C max of aprepitant decrease by 9 % and 10 % .
BMI of subjects in the analysis ranged from 18 kg / m 2 to 36 kg / m 2 .
This change is not considered clinically meaningful .
Drug Interactions Studies Fosaprepitant , given as a single 150 - mg dose , is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 , with no evidence of inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 observed on Day 4 .
The weak inhibition of CYP3A4 continues for 2 days after single dose administration of fosaprepitant .
Aprepitant is a substrate , an inhibitor , and an inducer of CYP3A4 .
Aprepitant is also an inducer of CYP2C9 .
Fosaprepitant or aprepitant is unlikely to interact with drugs that are substrates for the P - glycoprotein transporter .
Effects of Fosaprepitant / Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs CYP3A4 Substrates Midazolam : Fosaprepitant 150 mg administered as a single intravenous dose on Day 1 increased the AUC 0 - ∞ of midazolam by approximately 1 . 8 - fold on Day 1 and had no effect on Day 4 when midazolam was coadministered as a single oral dose of 2 mg on Days 1 and 4 [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Corticosteroids : Dexamethasone : Fosaprepitant administered as a single 150 mg intravenous dose on Day 1 increased the AUC 0 - 24 hr of dexamethasone , administered as a single 8 - mg oral dose on Days 1 , 2 , and 3 , by approximately 2 - fold on Days 1 and 2 [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Methylprednisolone : When oral aprepitant as a 3 - day regimen ( 125 - mg / 80 - mg / 80 - mg ) was administered with intravenous methylprednisolone 125 mg on Day 1 and oral methylprednisolone 40 mg on Days 2 and 3 , the AUC of methylprednisolone was increased by 1 . 34 - fold on Day 1 and by 2 . 5 - fold on Day 3 [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Chemotherapeutic agents : Docetaxel : In a pharmacokinetic study , oral aprepitant administered as a 3 - day regimen ( 125 - mg / 80 - mg / 80 - mg ) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel .
Vinorelbine : In a pharmacokinetic study , oral aprepitant administered as a 3 - day regimen ( 125 - mg / 80 - mg / 80 - mg ) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine to a clinically significant degree .
Oral contraceptives : When oral aprepitant was administered as a 3 - day regimen ( 125 - mg / 80 - mg / 80 - mg ) with ondansetron and dexamethasone , and coadministered with an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone , the trough concentrations of both ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone were reduced by as much as 64 % for 3 weeks post - treatment [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
CYP2C9 substrates ( Warfarin , Tolbutamide ) : Warfarin : A single 125 - mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 1 and 80 mg / day on Days 2 and 3 to subjects who were stabilized on chronic warfarin therapy .
Although there was no effect of oral aprepitant on the plasma AUC of R ( + ) or S ( - ) warfarin determined on Day 3 , there was a 34 % decrease in S ( - ) warfarin trough concentration accompanied by a 14 % decrease in the prothrombin time ( reported as International Normalized Ratio or INR ) 5 days after completion of dosing with oral aprepitant [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Tolbutamide : Oral aprepitant , when given as 125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg / day on Days 2 and 3 , decreased the AUC of tolbutamide by 23 % on Day 4 , 28 % on Day 8 , and 15 % on Day 15 , when a single dose of tolbutamide 500 mg was administered prior to the administration of the 3 - day regimen of oral aprepitant and on Days 4 , 8 , and 15 .
This effect was not considered clinically important .
Other Drugs P - glycoprotein substrates : Aprepitant is unlikely to interact with drugs that are substrates for the P - glycoprotein transporter , as demonstrated by the lack of interaction of oral aprepitant with digoxin in a clinical drug interaction study .
5 - HT 3 antagonists : In clinical drug interaction studies , aprepitant did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron , granisetron , or hydrodolasetron ( the active metabolite of dolasetron ) .
Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Fosaprepitant / Aprepitant Rifampin : When a single 375 - mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 9 of a 14 - day regimen of 600 mg / day of rifampin , a strong CYP3A4 inducer , the AUC of aprepitant decreased approximately 11 - fold and the mean terminal half - life decreased approximately 3 - fold [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Ketoconazole : When a single 125 - mg dose of oral aprepitant was administered on Day 5 of a 10 - day regimen of 400 mg / day of ketoconazole , a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor , the AUC of aprepitant increased approximately 5 - fold and the mean terminal half - life of aprepitant increased approximately 3 - fold [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Diltiazem : In a study in 10 patients with mild to moderate hypertension , administration of 100 mg of fosaprepitant as an intravenous infusion with 120 mg of diltiazem , a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor administered three times daily , resulted in a 1 . 5 - fold increase in the aprepitant AUC and a 1 . 4 - fold increase in the diltiazem AUC .
When fosaprepitant was administered with diltiazem , the mean maximum decrease in diastolic blood pressure was significantly greater than that observed with diltiazem alone [ 24 . 3 ± 10 . 2 mm Hg with fosaprepitant versus 15 . 6 ± 4 . 1 mm Hg without fosaprepitant ] .
The mean maximum decrease in systolic blood pressure was also greater after co - administration of diltiazem with fosaprepitant than administration of diltiazem alone [ 29 . 5 ± 7 . 9 mm Hg with fosaprepitant versus 23 . 8 ± 4 . 8 mm Hg without fosaprepitant ] .
Co - administration of fosaprepitant and diltiazem ; however , did not result in any additional clinically significant changes in heart rate or PR interval , beyond those changes observed with diltiazem alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Paroxetine : Coadministration of once daily doses of oral aprepitant 170 mg , with paroxetine 20 mg once daily , resulted in a decrease in AUC by approximately 25 % and C max by approximately 20 % of both aprepitant and paroxetine .
This effect was not considered clinically important .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in Sprague - Dawley rats and in CD - 1 mice for 2 years .
In the rat carcinogenicity studies , animals were treated with oral doses ranging from 0 . 05 to 1000 mg / kg twice daily .
The highest dose produced systemic exposures to aprepitant approximately equivalent to ( female rats ) or less than ( male rats ) the adult human exposure at the RHD of 150 mg .
Treatment with aprepitant at doses of 5 to 1000 mg / kg twice daily caused an increase in the incidences of thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas in male rats .
In female rats , it produced hepatocellular adenomas at 5 to 1000 mg / kg twice daily and hepatocellular carcinomas and thyroid follicular cell adenomas at 125 to 1000 mg / kg twice daily .
In the mouse carcinogenicity studies , the animals were treated with oral doses ranging from 2 . 5 to 2000 mg / kg / day .
The highest dose produced a systemic exposure approximately 2 times the adult human exposure at the RHD of 150 mg .
Treatment with aprepitant produced skin fibrosarcomas at 125 and 500 mg / kg / day doses in male mice .
Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted with fosaprepitant .
Mutagenesis Aprepitant and fosaprepitant were not genotoxic in the Ames test , the human lymphoblastoid cell ( TK6 ) mutagenesis test , the rat hepatocyte DNA strand break test , the Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell chromosome aberration test and the mouse micronucleus test .
Impairment of Fertility Fosaprepitant , when administered intravenously , is rapidly converted to aprepitant .
In the fertility studies conducted with fosaprepitant and aprepitant , the highest systemic exposures to aprepitant were obtained following oral administration of aprepitant .
Oral aprepitant did not affect the fertility or general reproductive performance of male or female rats at doses up to the maximum feasible dose of 1000 mg / kg twice daily ( providing exposure in male rats lower than the exposure at the recommended adult human dose of 150 mg and exposure in female rats approximately equivalent to the adult human exposure ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Prevention of Nausea and Vomiting Associated with HEC in Adults In a randomized , parallel , double - blind , active - controlled study , fosaprepitant for injection 150 mg as a single intravenous infusion ( N = 1147 ) was compared to a 3 - day oral aprepitant regimen ( N = 1175 ) in patients receiving a HEC regimen that included cisplatin ( ≥ 70 mg / m 2 ) .
All patients in both groups received dexamethasone and ondansetron ( see Table 11 ) .
Patient demographics were similar between the two treatment groups .
Of the total 2322 patients , 63 % were men , 56 % White , 26 % Asian , 3 % American Indian / Alaska Native , 2 % Black , 13 % Multi - Racial , and 33 % Hispanic / Latino ethnicity .
Patient ages ranged from 19 to 86 years of age , with a mean age of 56 years .
Other concomitant chemotherapy agents commonly administered were fluorouracil ( 17 % ) , gemcitabine ( 16 % ) , paclitaxel ( 15 % ) , and etoposide ( 12 % ) .
