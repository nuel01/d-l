( 2 . 3 , 2 . 4 ) 2 . 1 Important Dosage and Administration Information • POSIMIR is intended for single - dose administration only .
• Do not dilute or mix POSIMIR with local anesthetics or other drugs or diluents .
• As there is a potential risk of severe , life - threatening adverse reactions associated with the administration of bupivacaine , POSIMIR should be administered in a setting where trained personnel and equipment are available to promptly treat patients who show evidence of neurological or cardiac toxicity .
• Different formulations of bupivacaine are not bioequivalent to POSIMIR even if the milligram dosage is the same .
It is not possible to convert dosing from any other formulations of bupivacaine to POSIMIR and vice versa .
Do not substitute .
• The toxic effects of local anesthetics are additive .
Avoid additional use of local anesthetics within 168 hours following administration of POSIMIR .
• Avoid intravascular administration of POSIMIR .
Convulsions and cardiac arrest have occurred following accidental intravascular injection of bupivacaine and other amide - containing products .
• POSIMIR is not indicated for the following routes of administration .
• Epidural • Intrathecal • Intravascular • Intra - articular use [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 2 ) ] • Regional nerve blocks • Pre - incisional or pre - procedural locoregional anesthetic techniques that require deep and complete sensory block in the area of administration .
2 . 2 Recommended Dose The recommended dose of POSIMIR is 660 mg ( 5 mL ) .
2 . 3 Preparation , Administration , and Dosing Instructions • POSIMIR is ready to use and does not require dilution or mixing .
• Prior to administration , draw up POSIMIR into a 5 mL syringe using a large bore needle ( 16 gauge or larger ) .
Once the syringe has been filled , discard the large bore needle .
• At the close of surgery , administer the entire 5 mL dose of POSIMIR into the subacromial space using an 18 gauge or larger - bore needle .
The needle may be inserted through an existing arthroscopic port or through intact skin to reach the subacromial space .
Confirm correct placement of the needle tip within the subacromial space by direct arthroscopic visualization .
• Do not administer POSIMIR into the glenohumeral intra - articular space .
2 . 4 Compatibility Considerations POSIMIR is compatible with : • Commonly implantable materials , such as polypropylene and polyester • Silk , nylon , gut , polypropylene , polydioxanone , and polyglycolic acid sutures 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS POSIMIR ( bupivacaine solution ) is a sterile , nonpyrogenic , clear , light yellow to amber solution in a clear , glass vial .
• 5 mL single - dose vial : 660 mg / 5 mL ( 132 mg / mL ) Solution : 5 mL single - dose vial , 660 mg / 5 mL ( 132 mg / mL ) ( 3 ) .
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS POSIMIR is contraindicated in : • Patients with a known hypersensitivity ( e . g . anaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions ) to any amide local anesthetic , or other components of POSIMIR .
• Patients undergoing obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia .
The use of bupivacaine HCl with this technique has resulted in fetal bradycardia and death .
• Patients with a known hypersensitivity ( e . g . anaphylactic reactions and serious skin reactions ) to any amide local anesthetic , or other components of POSIMIR .
• Patients undergoing obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia ( 4 ) .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Risk of Joint Cartilage Necrosis with Unapproved Intra - articular Use : A study evaluating the effects of POSIMIR and POSIMIR vehicle in dogs following an intra - articular administration demonstrated joint cartilage necrosis ( 5 . 2 , 13 . 2 ) .
• Risk of Systemic Toxicity : Careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory ( adequacy of ventilation ) vital signs and the patient ' s state of consciousness should be performed after injection of bupivacaine .
( 5 . 3 ) • Methemoglobinemia : Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with local anesthetic use .
See Full Prescribing Information for more detail on managing these risks .
( 5 . 4 ) • Chondrolysis with Intra - Articular Infusion : Intra - articular infusions of local anesthetics including POSIMIR following arthroscopic and other surgical procedures is an unapproved use , and there have been post - marketing reports of chondrolysis in patients receiving such infusions .
( 5 . 5 ) 5 . 1 Risk of Potential Adverse Embolic Effects Resulting from Inadvertent Intravascular Injection Inadvertent intravascular injection could cause POSIMIR droplets to be deposited in the pulmonary and other capillary beds .
Administer POSIMIR into the subacromial space at the end of arthroscopic shoulder surgery .
Direct arthroscopic visualization must be used to confirm proper placement of the needle tip before injecting POSIMIR .
5 . 2 Risk of Joint Cartilage Necrosis with Unapproved Intra - articular Use The safety and effectiveness of POSIMIR in surgical procedures other than subacromial decompression have not been established , and POSIMIR is not approved for use via intra - articular injection .
A study evaluating the effects of POSIMIR and POSIMIR vehicle in dogs following an intra - articular administration demonstrated joint cartilage necrosis [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 3 Risk of Systemic Toxicity Unintended intravascular injection of POSIMIR may be associated with systemic toxicities , including CNS or cardiorespiratory depression and coma , progressing ultimately to respiratory arrest .
Direct arthroscopic visualization must be used to confirm proper placement of the needle tip in the subacromial space before injecting POSIMIR .
The safety and effectiveness of bupivacaine depend on proper dosage , correct technique , adequate precautions , and readiness for emergencies .
Careful and constant monitoring of cardiovascular and respiratory ( adequacy of ventilation ) vital signs and the patient ' s state of consciousness should be performed after injection of bupivacaine .
Possible early warning signs of central nervous system ( CNS ) toxicity are restlessness , anxiety , incoherent speech , lightheadedness , numbness and tingling of the mouth and lips , metallic taste , tinnitus , dizziness , blurred vision , tremors , twitching , CNS depression , or drowsiness .
Delay in proper management of systemic toxicity , underventilation from any cause , and / or altered sensitivity may lead to the development of acidosis , cardiac arrest , and , possibly , death .
Avoid additional use of local anesthetics within 168 hours following administration of POSIMIR .
Injection of repeated doses of bupivacaine may cause significant increases in plasma levels due to slow accumulation of the drug or its metabolites , or to slow metabolic degradation .
Tolerance to elevated blood levels varies with the status of the patient .
Consider increased monitoring for systemic toxicity in debilitated , elderly , or acutely ill patients .
5 . 4 Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with local anesthetic use .
Although all patients are at risk for methemoglobinemia , patients with glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency , congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia , cardiac or pulmonary compromise , infants under 6 months of age , and concurrent exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites are more susceptible to developing clinical manifestations of the condition [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
If local anesthetics must be used in these patients , close monitoring for symptoms and signs of methemoglobinemia is recommended .
Signs of methemoglobinemia may occur immediately or may be delayed some hours after exposure , and are characterized by a cyanotic skin discoloration and / or abnormal coloration of the blood .
Methemoglobin levels may continue to rise ; therefore , immediate treatment is required to avert more serious central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse effects , including seizures , coma , arrhythmias , and death .
Discontinue any oxidizing agents .
Depending on the severity of the signs and symptoms , patients may respond to supportive care , i . e . , oxygen therapy , hydration .
A more severe clinical presentation may require treatment with methylene blue , exchange transfusion , or hyperbaric oxygen .
5 . 5 Chondrolysis with Intra - Articular Infusion of Local Anesthetics Intra - articular infusions of local anesthetics including bupivacaine following arthroscopic and other surgical procedures is an unapproved use , and there have been post - marketing reports of chondrolysis in patients receiving such infusions .
The majority of reported cases of chondrolysis have involved the shoulder joint ; cases of gleno - humeral chondrolysis have been described in pediatric patients and adult patients following intra - articular infusions of local anesthetics with and without epinephrine for periods of 48 to 72 hours .
There is insufficient information to determine whether shorter infusion periods are associated with chondrolysis .
The time of onset of symptoms , such as joint pain , stiffness , and loss of motion can be variable , but may begin as early as the second month after surgery .
Currently , there is no effective treatment for chondrolysis ; patients who have experienced chondrolysis have required additional diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and some required arthroplasty or shoulder replacement .
5 . 6 Risk of Toxicity in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Because amide local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized by the liver , consider reduced dosing and increased monitoring for bupivacaine systemic toxicity in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment who are treated with POSIMIR [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
5 . 7 Risk of Use in Patients with Impaired Cardiovascular Function Care should be taken when considering the use of POSIMIR in patients with impaired cardiovascular function ( e . g . , hypotension , heartblock ) because they may be less able to compensate for functional changes associated with the prolongation of AV conduction produced by bupivacaine .
Consider reduced dosing .
Monitor patients closely for blood pressure , heart rate , and ECG changes .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions to bupivacaine hydrochloride are described in other sections of the prescribing information : • Systemic Toxicity with Intravascular Injection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Methemoglobinemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Chondrolysis with Intra - Articular Infusion [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Cardiovascular System Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] Adverse reactions reported with an incidence greater than or equal to 10 % and greater than control following POSIMIR administration in shoulder surgery were dizziness , dysgeusia , dysuria , headache , hypoesthesia , paresthesia , tinnitus , and vomiting ( 6 . 1 ) .
Adverse reactions reported with an incidence greater than or equal to 10 % and greater than control following POSIMIR administration in soft tissue surgical procedures were anemia , bradycardia , constipation , C - reactive protein increased , diarrhea , dizziness , dysgeusia , headache , nausea , post procedural contusion ( bruising ) , procedural pain , pruritus , pyrexia , somnolence , surgical site bleeding , visible bruising , and vomiting ( 6 . 1 ) .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates observed in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety of POSIMIR , doses ranging from 2 . 5 mL to 5 mL , was evaluated in 10 randomized , double - blind , controlled trials .
Overall , POSIMIR 5 mL , the recommended dose , has been administered to a total of 735 patients in clinical trials using a variety of administration methods , including the recommend method of infiltration .
Three trials were controlled with bupivacaine HCl , two trials were controlled with bupivacaine HCl and vehicle placebo , and five trials were controlled with vehicle placebo .
An additional 47 patients were treated with saline placebo in one of the bupivacaine HCl - controlled trials .
The evaluated surgical procedures included inguinal hernia repair , subacromial decompression of the shoulder , abdominal hysterectomy , laparotomy , laparoscopic cholecystectomy , and laparoscopically - assisted colectomy .
Shoulder surgical procedures There were three studies evaluating the safety of POSIMIR administered during shoulder surgery .
In Study 1 , one of three treatments was administered into the subacromial space at the end of surgery : POSIMIR , vehicle placebo , or bupivacaine HCl .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Do not dilute or mix POSIMIR with local anesthetics or other drugs or diluents .
Avoid additional use of local anesthetics within 168 hours following administration of POSIMIR .
7 . 1 Drugs Associated with Methemoglobinemia Patients who are administered POSIMIR are at increased risk of developing methemoglobinemia when concurrently exposed to following drugs , which could include other local anesthetics [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Examples of Drugs Associated with Methemoglobinemia : Class Examples Nitrates / Nitrites nitric oxide , nitroglycerin , nitroprusside , nitrous oxide Local anesthetics articaine , benzocaine , bupivacaine , lidocaine , mepivacaine , prilocaine , procaine , ropivacaine , tetracaine Antineoplastic agents cyclophosphamide , flutamide , hydroxyurea , ifosfamide , rasburicase Antibiotics dapsone , nitrofurantoin , para - aminosalicylic acid , sulfonamides Antimalarials chloroquine , primaquine Anticonvulsants phenobarbital , phenytoin , sodium valproate Other drugs acetaminophen , metoclopramide , quinine , sulfasalazine 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Moderate to Severe Hepatic Impairment : Consider reduced dosing and increased monitoring for bupivacaine toxicity .
( 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no studies conducted with POSIMIR in pregnant women .
In animal studies , embryo - fetal lethality was noted when bupivacaine was administered subcutaneously to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis at 0 . 6 times the maximum recommended human dose of POSIMIR at 660 mg bupivacaine .
Decreased pup survival was observed in a rat pre - and post - natal development study ( dosing from implantation through weaning ) at 0 . 6 times the maximum recommended human dose of POSIMIR at 660 mg bupivacaine .
Based on animal data , advise pregnant women of the potential risks to a fetus .
[ see Data ] The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
However , the background risk in the U . S . general population of major birth defects is 2 % - 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 % - 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
Clinical Considerations Labor or Delivery Bupivacaine is contraindicated for obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia .
While POSIMIR has not been studied with this technique , the use of bupivacaine for obstetrical paracervical block anesthesia has resulted in fetal bradycardia and death .
Bupivacaine can rapidly cross the placenta , and when used for epidural , caudal , or pudendal block anesthesia , can cause varying degrees of maternal , fetal , and neonatal toxicity ( POSIMIR is not indicated for these uses ) .
The incidence and degree of toxicity depend upon the procedure performed , the type , and amount of drug used , and the technique of drug administration .
Adverse reactions in the parturient , fetus , and neonate involve alterations of the central nervous system , peripheral vascular tone , and cardiac function .
Data Animal Data Bupivacaine hydrochloride produced developmental toxicity when administered subcutaneously to pregnant rats and rabbits at clinically relevant doses .
Bupivacaine hydrochloride was administered subcutaneously to rats at doses of 4 . 4 , 13 . 3 , & 40 mg / kg and to rabbits at doses of 1 . 3 , 5 . 8 , & 22 . 2 mg / kg during the period of organogenesis ( implantation to closure of the hard palate ) .
The high doses are approximately 0 . 6 times the daily maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 660 mg / day on a mg / m 2 body surface area ( BSA ) basis .
No embryo - fetal effects were observed in rats at the high dose which caused increased maternal lethality .
An increase in embryo - fetal deaths was observed in rabbits at the high dose in the absence of maternal toxicity with the fetal No Observed Adverse Effect Level representing approximately 0 . 2 times the MRHD on a BSA basis .
In a rat pre - and post - natal developmental study ( dosing from implantation through weaning ) conducted at subcutaneous doses of 4 . 4 , 13 . 3 , & 40 mg / kg , decreased pup survival was observed at the high dose .
The high dose is approximately 0 . 6 times the daily MRHD of 660 mg / day on a BSA basis .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary POSIMIR has not been studied in nursing mothers .
Bupivacaine can persist in plasma for up to 168 hours [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ] and benzyl alcohol , a POSIMIR excipient , for up to 12 hours after POSIMIR administration .
Both bupivacaine and benzyl alcohol have been reported to be excreted in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for POSIMIR and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from POSIMIR or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of POSIMIR in pediatric patients below the age of 18 have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients enrolled in the POSIMIR clinical studies ( N = 1463 ) , 167 patients were older than 65 years and 32 patients were older than 75 years .
In bupivacaine clinical studies , differences in various pharmacokinetic parameters have been observed between elderly and younger adult patients .
Bupivacaine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of adverse reactions to bupivacaine may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
Elderly patients may require lower doses of POSIMIR .
Consider increased monitoring for local anesthetic systemic toxicity when administering POSIMIR to elderly patients .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Because amide - type local anesthetics , such as bupivacaine , are metabolized by the liver , these drugs should be used with caution in patients with hepatic impairment .
Patients with severe hepatic impairment , because of their inability to metabolize local anesthetics normally , are at a greater risk of developing toxic plasma concentrations , and potentially local anesthetic systemic toxicity .
Care should be taken when considering the use of POSIMIR in patients with impaired hepatic function and consider reduced dosing .
Consider increased monitoring for local anesthetic systemic toxicity in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment when administering POSIMIR .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment Bupivacaine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Care should be taken when considering the use of POSIMIR in patients with impaired renal function .
Consider increased monitoring for local anesthetic systemic toxicity when administering POSIMIR to patients with impaired renal function .
10 OVERDOSAGE Acute emergencies from local anesthetics are generally related to high plasma concentrations encountered during therapeutic use of local anesthetics or to unintended intravascular injection of local anesthetic solution [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ] .
In the clinical study program , a maximum plasma concentration ( C max ) of 2850 ng / mL was reported .
No apparent bupivacaine - related adverse reactions or clinical sequelae were observed in patients with high bupivacaine plasma concentrations .
11 DESCRIPTION POSIMIR ( bupivacaine solution ) is a sterile nonpyrogenic , clear , light yellow to amber solution for infiltration .
Over time , the solution color will intensify within the range , from light yellow to amber .
The range of color is not associated with a change in potency of the drug product .
POSIMIR contains bupivacaine ( 132 mg / mL ) , benzyl alcohol , and sucrose acetate isobutyrate .
Bupivacaine , an amide - type local anesthetic , is 1 - butyl - N - ( 2 , 6 - dimethylphenyl ) - 2 - piperidinecarboxamide .
It is a white crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 288 . 43 g / mol .
The structure of bupivacaine is shown below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Bupivacaine is present in POSIMIR at a concentration of 132 mg / mL .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Bupivacaine blocks the generation and the conduction of nerve impulses , presumably by increasing the threshold for electrical excitation in the nerve , by slowing the propagation of the nerve impulse , and by reducing the rate of rise of the action potential .
In general , the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter , myelination and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers .
Clinically , the order of loss of nerve function is as follows : ( 1 ) pain , ( 2 ) temperature , ( 3 ) touch , ( 4 ) proprioception , and ( 5 ) skeletal muscle tone .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Systemic absorption of bupivacaine produces effects on the cardiovascular and central nervous systems .
At blood concentrations achieved with therapeutic doses , changes in cardiac conduction , excitability , refractoriness , contractility , and peripheral vascular resistance are minimal .
However , toxic blood concentrations depress cardiac conduction and excitability , which may lead to atrioventricular block , ventricular arrhythmias and to cardiac arrest , sometimes resulting in fatalities .
In addition , myocardial contractility is depressed and peripheral vasodilation occurs , leading to decreased cardiac output and arterial blood pressure .
These cardiovascular changes are more likely to occur after unintended intravascular injection of liquid formulations of bupivacaine .
Following systemic absorption , local anesthetics can produce central nervous system stimulation , depression or both .
Apparent central stimulation is usually manifested as restlessness , tremors and shivering , progressing to convulsions , followed by depression and coma , progressing ultimately to respiratory arrest .
However , the local anesthetics have a primary depressant effect on the medulla and on higher centers .
The depressed stage may occur without a prior excited stage .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Infiltration of POSIMIR into the surgical wound results in plasma levels of bupivacaine that can persist for 168 hours .
Systemic plasma levels of bupivacaine following administration of POSIMIR are not correlated with local efficacy .
Absorption The rate of systemic absorption of bupivacaine is dependent upon the total dose of drug administered , the route of administration , and the vascularity of the administration site .
Pharmacokinetic parameters of bupivacaine are shown in Table 10 after single - dose infiltration of POSIMIR in arthroscopic subacromial decompression surgical procedure .
Table 10 .

Bupivacaine appears to cross the placenta by passive diffusion .
The rate and degree of diffusion is governed by ( 1 ) the degree of plasma protein binding , ( 2 ) the degree of ionization , and ( 3 ) the degree of lipid solubility .
Fetal / maternal ratios of local anesthetics appear to be inversely related to the degree of plasma protein binding , because only the free , unbound drug is available for placental transfer .
Bupivacaine with a high protein binding capacity ( 95 % ) has a low fetal / maternal ratio ( 0 . 2 to 0 . 4 ) .
The extent of placental transfer is also determined by the degree of ionization and lipid solubility of the drug .
Lipid soluble , non - ionized drugs such as bupivacaine readily enter the fetal blood from the maternal circulation .
Elimination The mean half - life of bupivacaine after POSIMIR administration in adults who underwent arthroscopic subacromial decompression range from 16 . 4 to 26 . 1 hours .
Metabolism Amide - type local anesthetics such as bupivacaine are metabolized primarily in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid .
Pipecoloxylidine is the major metabolite of bupivacaine .
The elimination of drug from tissue distribution depends largely upon the availability of binding sites in the circulation to carry it to the liver where it is metabolized .
Excretion The kidney is the main excretory organ for most local anesthetics and their metabolites .
Urinary excretion is affected by urinary perfusion and factors affecting urinary pH . Only 6 % of bupivacaine is excreted unchanged in the urine .
Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment Pharmacokinetics of POSIMIR have not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment .
[ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetics of POSIMIR have not been evaluated in patients with renal impairment .
[ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Geriatric Patients Pharmacokinetics of POSIMIR have not been evaluated in geriatric patients .
Elderly patients have exhibited higher peak plasma concentrations than younger patients following administration of bupivacaine HCl .
The total plasma clearance was decreased in these patients [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long - term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of bupivacaine hydrochloride have not been conducted .
Mutagenesis Bupivacaine was negative in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay ( Ames assay ) , the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay ( human peripheral blood lymphocytes ) , and the in vivo rat micronucleus assay .
Impairment of Fertility The effect of bupivacaine on fertility has not been determined .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Necrosis of the joint cartilage was observed following intra - articular injection of a single dose of POSIMIR or POSIMIR vehicle in the dog model .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The effectiveness of POSIMIR was evaluated in ten adequate and well - controlled studies in patients undergoing open and laparoscopic abdominal procedures , abdominal hysterectomy , inguinal hernia repair , and open and arthroscopic shoulder procedures .
Adequate evidence of effectiveness was demonstrated in one of three studies conducted in patients undergoing shoulder surgery ( described in detail below ) and was not demonstrated in any soft tissue procedure evaluated .
Study 1 Study 1 was a randomized , multicenter , assessor blinded , placebo - controlled ( vehicle ) clinical trial in 107 patients undergoing arthroscopic subacromial decompression surgery with an intact rotator cuff .
Associated procedures included inspection of the glenohumeral joint , distal clavicle excision , bursectomy , synovectomy , removal of loose body , resection of coracoacromial ligament and subacromial spurs , rotator cuff debridement , and minor debridement of articular cartilage .
There were no open surgical procedures performed during this study .
The mean age was 50 years ( range 21 to 70 years ) , 60 % of treated patients were female , 96 % were White , 2 % were Hispanic , 1 % were Asian , and 1 % were Other .
Patients were randomized 2 : 1 : 1 to receive POSIMIR , vehicle placebo , or bupivacaine HCl 50 mg , and all patients received general anesthesia .
No analgesic pre - medication or local anesthetics were administered .
POSIMIR and vehicle placebo were administered under direct arthroscopic visualization as single injections into the subacromial space through one of the arthroscopic portals at the end of the surgery .
Bupivacaine HCl 50 mg was administered subacromially as a single dose .
Post - operatively , patients received acetaminophen 500 mg or 1000 mg every six hours , depending on body weight , through 72 hours , and were allowed morphine rescue medication as needed , either 2 mg IV or 10 mg orally .
Pain intensity was rated by the patients using a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale ( NRS ) at multiple time points up to 72 hours .
The primary outcome measures were the normalized area under the curve ( nAUC ) of mean pain intensity on movement scores collected at specified intervals over the first 72 hours after surgery and total opioid rescue analgesia ( IV morphine - equivalent dose ) through 72 hours .
In this clinical study , POSIMIR 5 mL demonstrated a significant reduction in mean pain intensity compared with placebo of 1 . 3 points on a 0 to 10 NRS scale over 72 hours ( Figure 1 ) .

Mean Pain Intensity on Movement Through 72 Hours After Surgery , Subacromial Decompression Study 1 [ MULTIMEDIA ] The median total use of opioid rescue analgesia ( IV morphine equivalent dose ) from 0 to 72 hours for the POSIMIR treatment group ( 4 mg ) was statistically lower than for the placebo treatment group ( 12 mg ) .
The median use of opioid rescue analgesia in the bupivacaine treatment group was 8 mg .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Study 2 Study 2 was a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled ( vehicle ) clinical trial in 60 patients undergoing arthroscopic subacromial decompression , inspection of glenohumeral joint , synovectomy , removal of loose body , minor debridement of articular cartilage , minor debridement or minor repair of rotator cuff , open distal clavicle excision , bursectomy , and resection of coracoacromial ligament and subacromial spurs .
The mean age was 48 years ( range 27 to 68 years ) , 55 % of treated patients were female , 95 % were White , 2 % were Asian , and 2 % were Other .
Patients were randomized 2 : 1 to receive POSIMIR or vehicle placebo , and all patients received general anesthesia .
Post - operatively , patients were allowed morphine rescue medication as needed , either 3 mg IV or 10 mg to 15 mg orally , or acetaminophen .
Pain intensity was rated by the patients using a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale ( NRS ) at multiple time points up to 72 hours .
The primary outcome measures were mean pain intensity on movement AUC through 72 hours and total opioid rescue analgesia ( IV morphine - equivalent dose ) through 72 hours .
There was no statistically significant difference in either primary endpoint between the POSIMIR and vehicle placebo treatment groups ( Figure 2 ) .
Figure 2 : Mean Pain Intensity on Movement Through 72 Hours After Surgery , Subacromial Decompression Study 2 [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Study 3 Study 3 was a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled ( vehicle ) and open - label PK clinical trial in 92 patients undergoing a variety of shoulder surgical procedures , including rotator cuff repair , subacromial decompression , glenoid labrum repair or debridement , and biceps tendon repair .
The majority of patients underwent arthroscopic procedures ; however , six patients underwent a combination of arthroscopic and open procedures .
The mean age was 54 years ( range 20 to 82 years ) , 59 % of treated patients were male , 87 % were White , 8 % were African American , 3 % were Other , and 2 % were Asian .
An equal number of patients were randomized to two cohorts .
The routes of POSIMIR or vehicle placebo administration in Cohort 1 were subacromial or subcutaneous injection or a combination .
In Cohort 2 , POSIMIR or vehicle placebo was administered via injection under direct arthroscopic visualization into the subacromial space .
Surgical procedures were completed either under local or general anesthesia .
Post - operatively , patients were allowed morphine IV , oxycodone orally , or acetaminophen orally as needed .
The primary outcome measures were mean pain intensity on movement and at rest through 120 hours and pain control through day seven .
There was no statistically significant difference in either primary endpoint between POSIMIR and vehicle placebo treatment groups ( Figure 3 ) .
