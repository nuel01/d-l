WHAT IS FUNGUS INFECTION OF THE FINGER AND TOE AREAS ?
Common fungus infections of the fingers and toes are caused by a variety of fungi ; actual living organisms ( members of the yeast and mold family ) which thrive in dark , moist conditions .
Using small breaches in the skin ' s surface , these organisms can cause infection by contact with infected surfaces , animals or people .
Once infection starts , spreading may occur .
For example , infected fingers and toes may infect other fingers and toes .
Although such infections often develop slowly , they may be difficult to eliminate if not treated promptly with an effective anti - fungal medicine like Fungicure .
HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A TOPICAL FUNGUS INFECTION ?
Some topical fungal infections may present themselves on the skin as ring - like formations with clear centers ; this is commonly called ringworm .
Athlete ' s foot fungus , when in the finger and toe areas , is often characterized by scaling of skin , burning , cracking , itching , and related discomforts .
When nails become infected , they may appear to become opaque ( cloudy white ) , thickened , brittle , easily broken , and in some cases , discolored ( greenish / brown ) .
UNDERSTANDING AND TREATING A NAIL AREA INFECTION : Fungal infections of the nail areas are often caused by the same fungi that lead to athlete ' s foot and ringworm infections elsewhere on the body .
These fungi can infect the entire area around the nails including the cuticles , the nail beds , and even the nails themselves .
When infected finger / toe nails are intact , over - the - counter topical anti - fungal treatments may not be able to penetrate and kill the fungus ; this is why all OTC topical treatments must indicate they are not effective on the nails .
However , in instances of advanced infection , the nails often are not intact ; they may be missing , cracked open , or lifted away , exposing the infected nail bed .
In these instances FUNGICURE Anti - Fungal Liquid Gel , with its powerful anti - fungal formula , can reach and kill nail bed fungus by direct application or related capillary action .
Fungicure cures the infection , allowing the natural regrowth of healthy looking tissue .
NOTE : Fungal infections which are isolated beneath an intact nail or embedded within the nail itself may require consultation from a doctor for proper treatment .
HOW FUNGICURE LIQUID GEL WORKS : MAXIMUM STRENGTH FUNGICURE Liquid Gel contains Clotrimazole , a widely recognized anti - fungal ingredient that has been proven to be effective against 6 types of fungus such as E . floccosum , T . mentagrophytes , M . canis , M . gypseum , T . tonsurans and T . rubrum .
When applied as directed , FUNGICURE Liquid Gel acts promptly to target , destroy , and prevent the spread of infection by inhibiting the growth and reproduction of fungal cells .
PROMPT ACTION AND PROPER TREATMENT : Early treatment of fungal infections is important .
If you suspect that you may have a fungal infection , consult your doctor promptly for advice and proper diagnosis .
You may wish to show him / her FUNGICURE Liquid Gel and discuss its use .
For best results , once treatment is started with FUNGICURE Liquid Gel , it is important to carefully follow the treatment instructions on the package until satisfactory results are achieved or advised further by a doctor .
NOTE : Noticeable improvement may be expected within 4 weeks in the case of most ringworm and athlete ' s foot fungus .
Consult your doctor for advice if noticeable improvement is not evident by this time or if condition persists or worsens .
