Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception .
( 5 . 7 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Myelosuppression and Increased Risk of Myelosuppression without Vitamin Supplementation Pemetrexed for injection can cause severe myelosuppression resulting in a requirement for transfusions and which may lead to neutropenic infection .
The risk of myelosuppression is increased in patients who do not receive vitamin supplementation .
In Study JMCH , incidences of Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia ( 38 % versus 23 % ) , thrombocytopenia ( 9 % versus 5 % ) , febrile neutropenia ( 9 % versus 0 . 6 % ) , and neutropenic infection ( 6 % versus 0 ) were higher in patients who received pemetrexed plus cisplatin without vitamin supplementation as compared to patients who were fully supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B 12 prior to and throughout pemetrexed plus cisplatin treatment .
Initiate supplementation with oral folic acid and intramuscular vitamin B 12 prior to the first dose of pemetrexed for injection ; continue vitamin supplementation during treatment and for 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed for injection to reduce the severity of hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity of pemetrexed for injection [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Obtain a complete blood count at the beginning of each cycle .
Do not administer pemetrexed for injection until the ANC is at least 1500 cells / mm 3 and platelet count is at least 100 , 000 cells / mm 3 .
Permanently reduce pemetrexed for injection in patients with an ANC of less than 500 cells / mm 3 or platelet count of less than 50 , 000 cells / mm 3 in previous cycles [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
In Studies JMDB and JMCH , among patients who received vitamin supplementation , incidence of Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia was 15 % and 23 % , the incidence of Grade 3 - 4 anemia was 6 % and 4 % , and incidence of Grade 3 - 4 thrombocytopenia was 4 % and 5 % , respectively .
In Study JMCH , 18 % of patients in the pemetrexed arm required red blood cell transfusions compared to 7 % of patients in the cisplatin arm [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In Studies JMEN , PARAMOUNT , and JMEI , where all patients received vitamin supplementation , incidence of Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia ranged from 3 % to 5 % , and incidence of Grade 3 - 4 anemia ranged from 3 % to 5 % .
5 . 2 Renal Failure Pemetrexed for injection can cause severe , and sometimes fatal , renal toxicity .
The incidences of renal failure in clinical studies in which patients received pemetrexed with cisplatin were : 2 . 1 % in Study JMDB and 2 . 2 % in Study JMCH .
The incidence of renal failure in clinical studies in which patients received pemetrexed as a single agent ranged from 0 . 4 % to 0 . 6 % ( Studies JMEN , PARAMOUNT , and JMEI [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Determine creatinine clearance before each dose and periodically monitor renal function during treatment with pemetrexed for injection .
Withhold pemetrexed for injection in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 45 mL / minute [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 3 Bullous and Exfoliative Skin Toxicity Serious and sometimes fatal , bullous , blistering and exfoliative skin toxicity , including cases suggestive of Stevens - Johnson Syndrome / Toxic epidermal necrolysis can occur with pemetrexed for injection .
Permanently discontinue pemetrexed for injection for severe and life - threatening bullous , blistering or exfoliating skin toxicity .
5 . 4 Interstitial Pneumonitis Serious interstitial pneumonitis , including fatal cases , can occur with pemetrexed for injection treatment .
Withhold pemetrexed for injection for acute onset of new or progressive unexplained pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea , cough , or fever pending diagnostic evaluation .
If pneumonitis is confirmed , permanently discontinue pemetrexed for injection .
5 . 5 Radiation Recall Radiation recall can occur with pemetrexed for injection in patients who have received radiation weeks to years previously .
Monitor patients for inflammation or blistering in areas of previous radiation treatment .
Permanently discontinue pemetrexed for injection for signs of radiation recall .
5 . 6 Increased Risk of Toxicity with Ibuprofen in Patients with Renal Impairment Exposure to pemetrexed for injection is increased in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment who take concomitant ibuprofen , increasing the risks of adverse reactions of pemetrexed for injection .
In patients with creatinine clearances between 45 mL / min and 79 mL / min , avoid administration of ibuprofen for 2 days before , the day of , and 2 days following administration of pemetrexed for injection .
If concomitant ibuprofen use cannot be avoided , monitor patients more frequently for pemetrexed for injection adverse reactions , including myelosuppression , renal , and gastrointestinal toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 7 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action , pemetrexed for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
In animal reproduction studies , intravenous administration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis was teratogenic , resulting in developmental delays and increased malformations at doses lower than the recommended human dose of 500 mg / m 2 .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed for injection and for 6 months after the final dose .
Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed for injection and for 3 months after the final dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Blood and Lymphatic System — immune - mediated hemolytic anemia • Gastrointestinal — colitis , pancreatitis • General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions — edema • Injury , poisoning , and procedural complications — radiation recall • Respiratory — interstitial pneumonitis • Skin — Serious and fatal bullous skin conditions , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , and toxic epidermal necrolysis 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Ibuprofen increased risk of pemetrexed for injection toxicity in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment .
Modify the ibuprofen dosage as recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance between 45 mL / min and 79 mL / min .
( 2 . 5 , 5 . 6 , 7 ) Effects of Ibuprofen on Pemetrexed Ibuprofen increases exposure ( AUC ) of pemetrexed [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In patients with creatinine clearance between 45 mL / min and 79 mL / min : • Avoid administration of ibuprofen for 2 days before , the day of , and 2 days following administration of pemetrexed for injection [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
• Monitor patients more frequently for myelosuppression , renal , and gastrointestinal toxicity , if concomitant administration of ibuprofen cannot be avoided .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action , pemetrexed for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data on pemetrexed for injection use in pregnant women .
In animal reproduction studies , intravenous administration of pemetrexed to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis was teratogenic , resulting in developmental delays and malformations at doses lower than the recommended human dose of 500 mg / m 2 [ see Data ] .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus [ see Use in Special Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Pemetrexed was teratogenic in mice .
Daily dosing of pemetrexed by intravenous injection to pregnant mice during the period of organogenesis increased the incidence of fetal malformations ( cleft palate ; protruding tongue ; enlarged or misshaped kidney ; and fused lumbar vertebra ) at doses ( based on BSA ) 0 . 03 times the human dose of 500 mg / m 2 .
At doses , based on BSA , greater than or equal to 0 . 0012 times the 500 mg / m 2 human dose , pemetrexed administration resulted in dose - dependent increases in developmental delays ( incomplete ossification of talus and skull bone ; and decreased fetal weight ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of pemetrexed or its metabolites in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from pemetrexed for injection , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with pemetrexed for injection and for one week after last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females Pemetrexed for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Because of the potential for genotoxicity , advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed for injection for at least 6 months after the final dose of pemetrexed for injection .
Males Because of the potential for genotoxicity , advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with pemetrexed for injection and for 3 months after the final dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Males Pemetrexed for injection may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential .
It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of pemetrexed for injection in pediatric patients have not been established .
The safety and pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed for injection were evaluated in two clinical studies conducted in pediatric patients with recurrent solid tumors . Pemetrexed was administered at doses ranging from 400 to 2480 mg / m 2 intravenously over 10 minutes on Day 1 of a 21 - day cycle to 32 pediatric patients with recurrent solid tumors in a dose - finding study .
The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) was determined to be 1910 mg / m 2 ( 60 mg / kg for patients < 12 months old ) .
Pemetrexed was administered at the MTD every 21 days in an activity - estimating study enrolling 72 patients with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma , Ewing sarcoma / peripheral primitive neural ectodermal tumor ( PNET ) , rhabdomyosarcoma , neuroblastoma , ependymoma , medulloblastoma / supratentorial PNET , or non - brainstem high grade glioma .
Patients in both studies received concomitant vitamin B 12 and folic acid supplementation and dexamethasone .
No tumor responses were observed .
Adverse reactions observed in pediatric patients were similar to those observed in adults .
Single - dose pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed administered at doses ranging from 400 to 2480 mg / m 2 were evaluated in 22 patients ( 13 males and 9 females ) age 4 to 18 years ( average age 12 years ) .
Pemetrexed exposure ( AUC and C max ) appeared to increase proportionally with dose .
Average clearance ( 2 . 30 L / h / m 2 ) and half - life ( 2 . 3 hours ) were similar in pediatric patients compared to adults .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 3 , 946 patients enrolled in clinical studies of pemetrexed , 34 % were 65 and over and 4 % were 75 and over .
No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients .
The incidences of Grade 3 - 4 anemia , fatigue , thrombocytopenia , hypertension , and neutropenia were higher in patients 65 years of age and older as compared to younger patients : in at least one of five randomized clinical trials .
[ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 , 14 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 6 Patients with Renal Impairment Pemetrexed is primarily excreted by the kidneys .
Decreased renal function results in reduced clearance and greater exposure ( AUC ) to pemetrexed compared with patients with normal renal function [ Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No dose is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 45 mL / min [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE No drugs are approved for the treatment of pemetrexed for injection overdose .
Based on animal studies , administration of leucovorin may mitigate the toxicities of pemetrexed for injection overdosage .
It is not known whether pemetrexed is dialyzable .
11 DESCRIPTION Pemetrexed for injection is a folate analog metabolic inhibitor .
The drug substance , pemetrexed disodium hemipentahydrate , has the chemical name N - { 4 - [ 2 - ( 2 - amino - 4 - oxo - 4 , 7 - dihydro - 1 H - pyrrolo [ 2 , 3 - d ] pyrimidin - 5 - yl ) ethyl ] phenyl ] carbonyl } - L - glutamic acid disodium , hemipentahydrate with a molecular formula of C 20 H 19 N 5 Na 2 O 6 • 2 . 5 H 2 O and a molecular weight of 516 . 41 .
The structural formula is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Pemetrexed for injection is a sterile white to either light yellow or greenish yellow lyophilized powder in single - dose vials to be reconstituted for intravenous infusion .
Each 100 - mg vial of pemetrexed for injection contains 100 mg pemetrexed ( equivalent to 120 . 8 mg pemetrexed disodium hemipentahydrate ) and 106 mg mannitol .
Each 500 - mg vial of pemetrexed for injection contains 500 mg pemetrexed ( equivalent to 604 mg pemetrexed disodium hemipentahydrate ) and 500 mg mannitol .
Each 1 - gram vial of pemetrexed for injection contains 1 gram pemetrexed ( equivalent to 1 . 208 gram pemetrexed disodium hemipentahydrate ) and 1 gram mannitol .
Hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide may have been added to adjust pH . [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Pemetrexed is a folate analog metabolic inhibitor that disrupts folate - dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication .
In vitro studies show that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase ( TS ) , dihydrofolate reductase , and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase ( GARFT ) , which are folate - dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides .
Pemetrexed is taken into cells by membrane carriers such as the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems .
Once in the cell , pemetrexed is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase .
The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Pemetrexed inhibited the in vitro growth of mesothelioma cell lines ( MSTO - 211 H , NCI - H2052 ) and showed synergistic effects when combined with cisplatin .
Based on population pharmacodynamic analyses , the depth of the absolute neutrophil counts ( ANC ) nadir correlates with the systemic exposure to pemetrexed and supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B 12 .
There is no cumulative effect of pemetrexed exposure on ANC nadir over multiple treatment cycles .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed when pemetrexed was administered as a single agent in doses ranging from 0 . 2 to 838 mg / m 2 infused over a 10 - minute period have been evaluated in 426 cancer patients with a variety of solid tumors .
Pemetrexed total systemic exposure ( AUC ) and maximum plasma concentration ( C max ) increased proportionally with increase of dose .
The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed did not change over multiple treatment cycles .
Distribution Pemetrexed has a steady - state volume of distribution of 16 . 1 liters .
In vitro studies indicated that pemetrexed is 81 % bound to plasma proteins .
Elimination The total systemic clearance of pemetrexed is 91 . 8 mL / min and the elimination half - life of pemetrexed is 3 . 5 hours in patients with normal renal function ( creatinine clearance of 90 mL / min ) .
As renal function decreases , the clearance of pemetrexed decreases and exposure ( AUC ) of pemetrexed increases .
Metabolism Pemetrexed is not metabolized to an appreciable extent .
Excretion Pemetrexed is primarily eliminated in the urine , with 70 % to 90 % of the dose recovered unchanged within the first 24 hours following administration .
In vitro studies indicated that pemetrexed is a substrate of OAT3 ( organic anion transporter 3 ) , a transporter that is involved in the active secretion of pemetrexed .
Specific Populations Age ( 26 to 80 years ) and sex had no clinically meaningful effect on the systemic exposure of pemetrexed based on population pharmacokinetic analyses .
Racial Groups The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed were similar in Whites and Blacks or African Americans .
Insufficient data are available for other ethnic groups .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Pemetrexed has not been formally studied in patients with hepatic impairment .
No effect of elevated AST , ALT , or total bilirubin on the PK of pemetrexed was observed in clinical studies .
Patients with Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic analyses of pemetrexed included 127 patients with impaired renal function .
Plasma clearance of pemetrexed decreases as renal function decreases , with a resultant increase in systemic exposure .
Patients with creatinine clearances of 45 , 50 , and 80 mL / min had 65 % , 54 % , and 13 % increases , respectively in systemic exposure ( AUC ) compared to patients with creatinine clearance of 100 mL / min [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Third - Space Fluid The pemetrexed plasma concentrations in patients with various solid tumors with stable , mild to moderate third - space fluid were comparable to those observed in patients without third space fluid collections .
The effect of severe third space fluid on pharmacokinetics is not known .
Drug Interaction Studies Drugs Inhibiting OAT3 Transporter Ibuprofen , an OAT3 inhibitor , administered at 400 mg four times a day decreased the clearance of pemetrexed and increased its exposure ( AUC ) by approximately 20 % in patients with normal renal function ( creatinine clearance > 80 mL / min ) .
In Vitro Studies Pemetrexed is a substrate for OAT3 .
Ibuprofen , an OAT3 inhibitor inhibited the uptake of pemetrexed in OAT3 - expressing cell cultures with an average [ I u ] / IC 50 ratio of 0 . 38 .
In vitro data predict that at clinically relevant concentrations , other NSAIDs ( naproxen , diclofenac , celecoxib ) would not inhibit the uptake of pemetrexed by OAT3 and would not increase the AUC of pemetrexed to a clinically significant extent .
[ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Pemetrexed is a substrate for OAT4 .
In vitro , ibuprofen and other NSAIDs ( naproxen , diclofenac , celecoxib ) are not inhibitors of OAT4 at clinically relevant concentrations .
Aspirin Aspirin , administered in low to moderate doses ( 325 mg every 6 hours ) , does not affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed .
Cisplatin Cisplatin does not affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed and the pharmacokinetics of total platinum are unaltered by pemetrexed .
Vitamins Neither folic acid nor vitamin B 12 affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed .
Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro studies suggest that pemetrexed does not inhibit the clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP3A , CYP2D6 , CYP2C9 , and CYP1A2 .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with pemetrexed .
Pemetrexed was clastogenic in an in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse bone marrow but was not mutagenic in multiple in vitro tests ( Ames assay , Chinese Hamster Ovary cell assay ) .
Pemetrexed administered intraperitoneally at doses of ≥ 0 . 1 mg / kg / day to male mice ( approximately 0 . 006 times the recommended human dose based on BSA ) resulted in reduced fertility , hypospermia , and testicular atrophy .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Non - Squamous NSCLC Initial Treatment in Combination with Pembrolizumab and Platinum The efficacy of pemetrexed in combination with pembrolizumab and platinum chemotherapy was investigated in Study KEYNOTE - 189 ( NCT02578680 ) , a randomized , multicenter , double - blind , active - controlled trial conducted in patients with metastatic non - squamous NSCLC , regardless of PD - L1 tumor expression status , who had not previously received systemic therapy for metastatic disease and in whom there were no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations .
Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment ; a medical condition that required immunosuppression ; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible .
Randomization was stratified by smoking status ( never versus former / current ) , choice of platinum ( cisplatin versus carboplatin ) , and tumor PD - L1 status ( TPS < 1 % [ negative ] versus TPS ≥ 1 % ) .
Patients were randomized ( 2 : 1 ) to one of the following treatment arms : • Pemetrexed 500 mg / m 2 , pembrolizumab 200 mg , and investigator ' s choice of cisplatin 75 mg / m 2 or carboplatin AUC 5 mg / mL / min intravenously on Day 1 of each 21 - day cycle for 4 cycles followed by pemetrexed 500 mg / m 2 and pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks .
pemetrexed was administered after pembrolizumab and prior to platinum chemotherapy on Day 1 .
• Placebo , pemetrexed 500 mg / m 2 , and investigator ' s choice of cisplatin 75 mg / m 2 or carboplatin AUC 5 mg / mL / min intravenously on Day 1 of each 21 - day cycle for 4 cycles followed by placebo and pemetrexed 500 mg / m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks .
Treatment with pemetrexed continued until RECIST v1 . 1 ( modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ ) - defined progression of disease as determined by the investigator or unacceptable toxicity .
Patients randomized to placebo , pemetrexed , and platinum chemotherapy were offered pembrolizumab as a single agent at the time of disease progression .
Assessment of tumor status was performed at Week 6 , Week 12 , and then every 9 weeks thereafter .
The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR RECIST v1 . 1 , modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of five target lesions per organ .
Additional efficacy outcome measures were ORR and duration of response , as assessed by the BICR according to RECIST v1 . 1 , modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ .
A total of 616 patients were randomized : 410 patients to the pemetrexed , pembrolizumab , and platinum chemotherapy arm and 206 to the placebo , pemetrexed , and platinum chemotherapy arm .
The study population characteristics were : median age of 64 years ( range : 34 to 84 ) ; 49 % age 65 or older ; 59 % male ; 94 % White and 3 % Asian ; 56 % ECOG performance status of 1 ; and 18 % with history of brain metastases .
Thirty - one percent had tumor PD - L1 expression TPS < 1 % .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] Initial Treatment in Combination with Cisplatin The efficacy of pemetrexed was evaluated in Study JMDB ( NCT00087711 ) , a multi - center , randomized ( 1 : 1 ) , open - label study conducted in 1725 chemotherapy - naive patients with Stage IIIb / IV NSCLC .
Patients were randomized to receive pemetrexed with cisplatin or gemcitabine with cisplatin .
Randomization was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ( ECOG PS 0 versus 1 ) , gender , disease stage , basis for pathological diagnosis ( histopathological / cytopathological ) , history of brain metastases , and investigative center .
Pemetrexed was administered intravenously over 10 minutes at a dose of 500 mg / m 2 on Day 1 of each 21 - day cycle .
Cisplatin was administered intravenously at a dose of 75 mg / m 2 approximately 30 minutes after pemetrexed administration on Day 1 of each cycle , gemcitabine was administered at a dose of 1250 mg / m 2 on Day 1 and Day 8 , and cisplatin was administered intravenously at a dose of 75 mg / m 2 approximately 30 minutes after administration of gemcitabine , on Day 1 of each 21 - day cycle .
Treatment was administered up to a total of 6 cycles ; patients in both arms received folic acid , vitamin B 12 , and dexamethasone [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
The primary efficacy outcome measure was overall survival .
A total of 1725 patients were enrolled with 862 patients randomized to pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin and 863 patients to gemcitabine in combination with cisplatin .
The median age was 61 years ( range 26 - 83 years ) , 70 % were male , 78 % were White , 17 % were Asian , 2 . 9 % were Hispanic or Latino , and 2 . 1 % were Black or African American , and < 1 % were other ethnicities .
Among patients for whom ECOG PS ( n = 1722 ) and smoking history ( n = 1516 ) were collected , 65 % had an ECOG PS of 1 , 36 % had an ECOG PS of 0 , and 84 % were smokers .
For tumor characteristics , 73 % had non - squamous NSCLC and 27 % had squamous NSCLC ; 76 % had Stage IV disease .
Among 1252 patients with non - squamous NSCLC histology , 68 % had a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma , 12 % had large cell histology and 20 % had other histologic subtypes .

Patients were randomized to receive pemetrexed 500 mg / m 2 intravenously every 21 days or placebo until disease progression or intolerable toxicity .
Patients in both study arms received folic acid , vitamin B 12 , and dexamethasone [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Randomization was carried out using a minimization approach [ Pocock and Simon ( 1975 ) ] using the following factors : gender , ECOG PS ( 0 versus 1 ) , response to prior chemotherapy ( complete or partial response versus stable disease ) , history of brain metastases ( yes versus no ) , non - platinum component of induction therapy ( docetaxel versus gemcitabine versus paclitaxel ) , and disease stage ( IIIb versus IV ) .
The major efficacy outcome measures were progression - free survival based on assessment by independent review and overall survival ; both were measured from the date of randomization in Study JMEN .
A total of 663 patients were enrolled with 441 patients randomized to pemetrexed and 222 patients randomized to placebo .
The median age was 61 years ( range 26 - 83 years ) ; 73 % were male ; 65 % were White , 32 % were Asian , 2 . 9 % were Hispanic or Latino , and < 2 % were other ethnicities ; 60 % had an ECOG PS of 1 ; and 73 % were current or former smokers .
Median time from initiation of platinum - based chemotherapy to randomization was 3 . 3 months ( range 1 . 6 to 5 . 1 months ) and 49 % of the population achieved a partial or complete response to first - line , platinum - based chemotherapy .
With regard to tumor characteristics , 81 % had Stage IV disease , 73 % had non - squamous NSCLC and 27 % had squamous NSCLC .
Among the 481 patients with non - squamous NSCLC , 68 % had adenocarcinoma , 4 % had large cell , and 28 % had other histologies .

Patients were randomized ( n = 456 ) to receive pemetrexed 500 mg / m 2 intravenously over 10 minutes followed 30 minutes later by cisplatin 75 mg / m 2 intravenously over two hours on Day 1 of each 21 - day cycle or to receive cisplatin 75 mg / m 2 intravenously over 2 hours on Day 1 of each 21 - day cycle ; treatment continued until disease progression or intolerable toxicity .
The study was modified after randomization and treatment of 117 patients to require that all patients receive folic acid 350 mcg to 1000 mcg daily beginning 1 to 3 weeks prior to the first dose of pemetrexed and continuing until 1 to 3 weeks after the last dose , vitamin B 12 1000 mcg intramuscularly 1 to 3 weeks prior to first dose of pemetrexed and every 9 weeks thereafter , and dexamethasone 4 mg orally , twice daily , for 3 days starting the day prior to each pemetrexed dose .
Randomization was stratified by multiple baseline variables including KPS , histologic subtype ( epithelial , mixed , sarcomatoid , other ) , and gender .
The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival and additional efficacy outcome measures were time to disease progression , overall response rate , and response duration .
A total of 448 patients received at least one dose of protocol - specified therapy ; 226 patients were randomized to and received at least one dose of pemetrexed plus cisplatin , and 222 patients were randomized to and received cisplatin .
Among the 226 patients who received cisplatin with pemetrexed , 74 % received full supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B 12 during study therapy , 14 % were never supplemented , and 12 % were partially supplemented .
Across the study population , the median age was 61 years ( range : 20 to 86 years ) ; 81 % were male ; 92 % were White , 5 % were Hispanic or Latino , 3 . 1 % were Asian , and < 1 % were other ethnicities ; and 54 % had a baseline KPS score of 90 - 100 % and 46 % had a KPS score of 70 - 80 % .
