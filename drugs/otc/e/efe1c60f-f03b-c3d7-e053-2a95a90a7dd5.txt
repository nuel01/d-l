USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 .
Pregnancy Risk Summary The published data on angiotensin II use in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug - associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with GIAPREZA .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk Septic or other distributive shock is a medical emergency that can be fatal if left untreated .
Delaying treatment in pregnant women with hypotension associated with septic or other distributive shock is likely to increase the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality .
8 . 2 .
Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether GIAPREZA is present in human milk .
No data are available on the effects of angiotensin II on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production .
8 . 4 .
Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of GIAPREZA in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 .
Geriatric Use In ATHOS - 3 , 48 % of the total patient population was aged 65 years and older .
There was no significant difference in safety or efficacy between patients less than 65 and those 65 years or older when treated with GIAPREZA .
10 .
OVERDOSAGE Overdose of GIAPREZA would be expected to result in hypertension , necessitating close monitoring and supportive care .
Effects are expected to be brief because the half - life of angiotensin II is less than one minute .

DESCRIPTION Angiotensin II is a naturally occurring peptide hormone of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system ( RAAS ) that causes vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure .
GIAPREZA is a sterile , aqueous solution of synthetic human angiotensin II for intravenous administration by infusion .
Each 2 . 5 mg / mL vial of GIAPREZA contains 2 . 5 mg angiotensin II equivalent to an average of 2 . 9 mg angiotensin II acetate , 25 mg mannitol , and Water for Injection adjusted with sodium hydroxide and / or hydrochloric acid to pH of 5 . 5 .
Each 0 . 5 mg / mL vial of GIAPREZA contains 0 . 5 mg angiotensin II equivalent to an average of 0 . 6 mg angiotensin II acetate , 25 mg mannitol , and Water for Injection adjusted with sodium hydroxide and / or hydrochloric acid to pH of 5 . 5 .
The chemical name of the synthetic angiotensin II acetate is L - Aspartyl - L - arginyl - L - valyl - Ltyrosyl - L - isoleucyl - L - histidyl - L - prolyl - L - phenylalanine , acetate salt .
The counter ion acetate is present in a non - stoichiometric ratio .
It is a white to off - white powder , soluble in water .
The structure of angiotensin II acetate is shown below .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Molecular formula : C 50 H 71 N 13 O 12 ∙ ( C 2 H 4 O 2 ) n ; ( n = number of acetate molecules ; theoretical n = 3 ) Average molecular weight : 1046 . 2 ( as free base ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 .
Mechanism of Action Angiotensin II raises blood pressure by vasoconstriction and increased aldosterone release .
Direct action of angiotensin II on the vessel wall is mediated by binding to the G - protein - coupled angiotensin II receptor type 1 on vascular smooth muscle cells , which stimulates Ca 2 + / calmodulin - dependent phosphorylation of myosin and causes smooth muscle contraction .
12 . 2 .
Pharmacodynamics For the 114 ( 70 % ) patients in the GIAPREZA arm who reached the target MAP at Hour 3 , the median time to reach the target MAP endpoint was approximately 5 minutes .
GIAPREZA is titrated to effect for each individual patient .
12 . 3 .
Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous infusion of angiotensin II in adults with septic or other distributive shock , serum levels of angiotensin II are similar at Baseline and Hour 3 after intravenous infusion .
After 3 hours of treatment , however , the serum level of angiotensin I ( the angiotensin II precursor peptide ) is reduced by approximately 40 % .
Distribution : No specific studies were conducted that examined the distribution of GIAPREZA .
Metabolism and Excretion : No specific studies were conducted that examined the metabolism and excretion of GIAPREZA .
The plasma half - life of IV administered angiotensin II is less than one minute .
It is metabolized by aminopeptidase A and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 to angiotensin - ( 2 - 8 ) [ angiotensin III ] and angiotensin - ( 1 - 7 ) , respectively in plasma , erythrocytes and many of the major organs ( i . e . , intestine , kidney , liver and lung ) .
Angiotensin II type 1 receptor ( AT1 ) mediated activity of angiotensin III is approximately 40 % of angiotensin II ; however , aldosterone synthesis activity is similar to angiotensin II .
Angiotensin - ( 1 - 7 ) exerts the opposite effects of angiotensin II on AT1 receptors and causes vasodilation .
Specific Populations No formal pharmacokinetic studies were conducted with GIAPREZA in the following specific populations .
Renal Impairment The clearance of angiotensin II is not dependent on renal function .
Therefore , the pharmacokinetics of GIAPREZA are not expected to be influenced by renal impairment .
Hepatic Impairment The clearance of angiotensin II is not dependent on hepatic function .
Therefore , the pharmacokinetics of GIAPREZA are not expected to be influenced by hepatic impairment .
Age The effect of age was analyzed in the 163 patients receiving GIAPREZA in ATHOS - 3 .
There were no significant differences in pharmacokinetics between age groups ( < 65 years / ≥ 65 years ) .
Male and Female Patients The effect of sex was analyzed in the 163 patients receiving GIAPREZA in ATHOS - 3 .
There were no significant differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female patients .

NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No genetic toxicity studies have been conducted with GIAPREZA .
No carcinogenicity or fertility studies with GIAPREZA have been conducted in animals .
13 . 2 .
Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology No animal toxicology studies were conducted with GIAPREZA .
13 . 3 .
Safety Pharmacology In a cardiovascular safety pharmacology study in normotensive dogs , GIAPREZA doses of 150 , 450 , and 1 , 800 ng / kg ( 5 , 15 , and 60 ng / kg / min ) were infused intravenously for 30 minutes each .
At ≥ 450 ng / kg , GIAPREZA caused significantly elevated MAP and systemic vascular resistance , as expected .
The 1 , 800 ng / kg dose also caused increased heart rate , increased systemic vascular resistance , increased left ventricular systolic and end - diastolic pressures , and PR interval prolongation .
GIAPREZA did not significantly alter respiratory rate or cause electrocardiographic changes in QRS duration or QTc .

CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 .
ATHOS - 3 The Angiotensin II for the Treatment of High - Output Shock ( ATHOS - 3 ) trial was a double - blind study in which 321 adults with septic or other distributive shock who remained hypotensive despite fluid and vasopressor therapy were randomized 1 : 1 and treated with either GIAPREZA or placebo , both in addition to background vasopressor therapy .
Doses of GIAPREZA or placebo were titrated to a target MAP of ≥ 75 mmHg during the first 3 hours of treatment while doses of other vasopressors were maintained .
From Hour 3 to Hour 48 , GIAPREZA or placebo were titrated to maintain MAP between 65 and 70 mmHg while reducing doses of other vasopressors .
The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects who achieved either a MAP ≥ 75 mmHg or a ≥ 10 mmHg increase in MAP without an increase in baseline vasopressor therapy at 3 hours .
91 % of subjects had septic shock ; the remaining subjects had other forms of distributive shock such as neurogenic shock .
At the time of study drug administration , 97 % of subjects were receiving norepinephrine , 67 % vasopressin , 15 % phenylephrine , 13 % epinephrine , and 2 % dopamine .
83 % of subjects had received two or more vasopressors and 47 % three or more vasopressors prior to study drug administration .
61 % of subjects were male , 80 % were White , 10 % were Black , and 10 % were other races .
The median age of subjects was 64 years ( range : 22 - 89 years ) .
Patients requiring high doses of steroids , patients with a history of asthma or bronchospasm , and patients with Raynaud ' s syndrome were not included .
The primary endpoint was achieved by 70 % of patients randomized to GIAPREZA compared to 23 % of placebo patients ; p < 0 . 0001 ( a treatment effect of 47 % ) .
Figure 1 shows the results in all patients and in selected subgroups .
Figure 1 : ATHOS - 3 : Primary Endpoint – Overall Result and Results in Selected Subgroups [ MULTIMEDIA ] NE Equiv = norepinephrine equivalent dose : the sum of all vasopressor doses with each vasopressor dose converted to the clinically equivalent norepinephrine dose .
Note : The figure above presents effects in various subgroups , all of which are baseline characteristics .
The 95 % confidence limits that are shown do not take into account the number of comparisons made and may not reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors .
Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over - interpreted .
In the GIAPREZA - treated group , the median time to reach the target MAP endpoint was 5 minutes .
The effect on MAP was sustained for at least the first three hours of treatment .
The median dose of GIAPREZA was 10 ng / kg / min at 30 minutes .
Of the 114 responders at Hour 3 , only 2 ( 1 . 8 % ) received more than 80 ng / kg / min .
Patients were not necessarily on maximum doses of other vasopressors at the time of randomization .
The effect of GIAPREZA when added to maximum doses of other vasopressors is unknown .
Mortality through Day 28 was 46 % on GIAPREZA and 54 % on placebo ( hazard ratio 0 . 78 ; 95 % confidence interval 0 . 57 – 1 . 07 ) .
