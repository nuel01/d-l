To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules and other antibacterial drugs , minocycline hydrochloride capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria .
DESCRIPTION Minocycline hydrochloride is a semisynthetic derivative of tetracycline , 4 , 7 - Bis ( dimethylamino ) - 1 , 4 , 4 a , 5 , 5 a , 6 , 11 , 12 a - octahydro - 3 , 10 , 12 , 12 a - tetrahydroxy - 1 , 11 - dioxo - 2 - naphthacenecarboxamide monohydrochloride .
Its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] C H N O • HCl M . W . 493 . 95 232737 Each minocycline hydrochloride capsule , for oral administration , contains the equivalent of 50 mg , 75 mg , or 100 mg of minocycline .
In addition each capsule contains the following inactive ingredients : magnesium stearate and starch ( corn ) .
The 50 mg , 75 mg , and 100 mg capsule shells contain : D & C Red No . 28 , D & C Yellow No . 10 , gelatin , silicon dioxide , sodium lauryl sulfate and titanium dioxide .
The 100 mg capsule shell also contains black iron oxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two 100 mg capsules of minocycline HCl administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers , maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours ( average 2 . 1 hours ) and ranged from 2 . 1 to 5 . 1 μg / mL ( average 3 . 5 μg / mL ) .
The serum half - life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11 . 1 to 22 . 1 hours ( average 15 . 5 hours ) .
When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a meal which included dairy products , the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was not noticeably influenced .
The peak plasma concentrations were slightly decreased ( 11 . 2 % ) and delayed by one hour when administered with food , compared to dosing under fasting conditions .
In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms , the minocycline serum half - life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction , and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction .
The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one - half to one - third that of other tetracyclines .
Microbiology The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis .
The tetracyclines , including minocycline , have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram - positive and gram - negative organisms .
Cross - resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common .
Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the section .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE AEROBIC GRAM - POSITIVE MICROORGANISMS Because many strains of the following gram - positive microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines , culture and susceptibility testing are especially recommended .
Tetracycline antibiotics should not be used for streptococcal diseases unless the organism has been demonstrated to be susceptible .
Tetracyclines are not the drug of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infection .
Bacillus anthracis1 Listeria monocytogenes1 Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae AEROBIC GRAM - NEGATIVE MICROORGANISMS species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella Calymmatobacterium granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Because many strains of the following groups of gram - negative microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines , culture and susceptibility tests are especially recommended .

1 Susceptibility Tests Susceptibility testing should be performed with tetracycline since it predicts susceptibility to minocycline .
However , certain organisms ( e . g . , some staphylococci , and species ) may be more susceptible to minocycline and doxycycline than to tetracycline .
Acinetobacter Dilution techniques : Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations ( MICs ) .
These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds .
The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure .
Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method ( Ref1 , Ref3 ( broth or agar ) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tetracycline powder .
The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria : For testing aerobic gram - negative microorganisms ( Enterobacteriaceae ) , species and AcinetobacterStaphylococcus aureus : MIC ( μg / mL ) Interpretation ≤ 4 . 0 Susceptible ( S ) 8 . 0 Intermediate ( I ) ≥ 16 . 0 Resistant ( R ) For testing and : Haemophilus influenzae2Streptococcus pneumoniae3 MIC ( μg / mL ) Interpretation ≤ 2 . 0 Susceptible ( S ) 4 . 0 Intermediate ( I ) ≥ 8 . 0 Resistant ( R ) These interpretative standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility testing with using Haemophilus Test Medium .
Ref1 2 Haemophilus influenzae These interpretative standards are applicable only to broth microdilution susceptibility testing using cation - adjusted Muller - Hinton broth with 2 - 5 % lysed horse blood .
31 For testing : Neisseria gonorrhoeae4 MIC ( μg / mL ) Interpretation ≤ 0 . 25 Susceptible ( S ) 0 . 5 - 1 . 0 Intermediate ( I ) ≥ 2 . 0 Resistant ( R ) These interpretative standards are applicable only to agar dilution susceptibility testing using GC agar base and 1 % defined growth supplements .
Ref1 4 A report of “ Susceptible ” indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable .
A report of “ Intermediate ” indicates that the result should be considered equivocal , and , if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative , clinically feasible drugs , the test should be repeated .
This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used .
This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation .
A report of “ Resistant ” indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable ; other therapy should be selected .
Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures .
Standard tetracycline powder should provide the following MIC values : Microorganism MIC Range ( μg / mL ) ATCC 25922 Escherichia coli 0 . 5 - 2 . 0 Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 8 . 0 - 32 . 0 ATCC 29213 Staphylococcus aureus 0 . 25 - 1 . 0 ATCC 49247 Haemophilus influenzae 4 . 0 - 32 . 0 ATCC 49619 Streptococcus pneumoniae 0 . 12 - 0 . 5 ATCC 49226 Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0 . 25 - 1 . 0 Diffusion techniques : Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds .
One such standardized procedure ( Ref2 , Ref3 ) requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations .
This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 μg tetracycline ( class disk ) or 30 μg minocycline to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to minocycline .
Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single - disk susceptibility test with a 30 - μg tetracycline or minocycline disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria : For testing aerobic gram - negative microorganisms ( Enterobac - teriaceae ) , species and : AcinetobacterStaphylococcus aureus Zone Diameter ( mm ) Interpretation ≥ 19 Susceptible ( S ) 15 - 18 Intermediate ( I ) ≤ 14 Resistant ( R ) For testing Haemophilus influenzae : 5 Zone Diameter ( mm ) Interpretation ≥ 29 Susceptible ( S ) 26 - 28 Intermediate ( I ) ≤ 25 Resistant ( R ) These zone diameter standards are applicable only to susceptibility testing with using Haemophilus Test Medium and a 30 - μg tetracycline disk .
Ref2 5 Haemophilus influenzae For testing Neisseria gonorrhoeae : 6 Zone Diameter ( mm ) Interpretation ≥ 38 Susceptible ( S ) 31 - 37 Intermediate ( I ) ≤ 30 Resistant ( R ) These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing using GC agar and 1 % growth supplements , and a 30 - μg tetracycline disk .
Ref2 6 For testing : Streptococcus pneumoniae7 Zone Diameter ( mm ) Interpretation ≥ 23 Susceptible ( S ) 19 - 22 Intermediate ( I ) ≤ 18 Resistant ( R ) These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing using Muller - Hinton agar adjusted with 5 % sheep blood and a 30 - μg tetracycline disk .
Ref2 7 For testing Vibrio cholerae : 8 Zone Diameter ( mm ) Interpretation ≥ 19 Susceptible ( S ) 15 - 18 Intermediate ( I ) ≤ 14 Resistant ( R ) These interpretative standards are applicable only to disk diffusion testing performed with a 30 - μg tetracycline disk .
Ref2 8 Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques .
Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for tetracycline .
As with standardized dilution techniques , diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures .
For the diffusion technique , the 30 - μg tetracycline or minocycline disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory test quality control strains : Microorganism Zone Diameter Range ( mm ) Tetracycline Minocycline ATCC 25922 Escherichia coli 18 - 25 19 - 25 ATCC 25923 Staphylococcus aureus 24 - 30 25 - 30 ATCC 49247 Haemophilus influenzae 14 - 22 – ATCC 49226 Neisseria gonorrhoeae 30 - 42 – ATCC 49619 Streptococcus pneumoniae 27 - 31 – INDICATIONS AND USAGE Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are indicated in the treatment of the following infections due to susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms : • Rocky Mountain spotted fever , typhus fever and the typhus group , Q fever , rickettsialpox and tick fevers caused by rickettsiae .

In acute minocycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides .
intestinal amebiasis , In severe minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy .
acne , Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx .
In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers , diagnostic laboratory procedures , including serotyping and susceptibility testing , should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment .
It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high .
Neisseria meningitidis Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection .
Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted , limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum .
To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules and other antibacterial drugs , minocycline hydrochloride capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria .
When culture and susceptibility information are available , they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy .
In the absence of such data , local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy .
CONTRAINDICATIONS This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines or to any of the components of the product formulation .
WARNINGS MINOCYCLINE , LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE - CLASS ANTIBIOTICS , CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN .
IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS , THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS .
THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT ( LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY , INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS ) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH ( YELLOW - GRAY - BROWN ) .
This adverse reaction is more common during long - term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short - term courses .
Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported .
TETRACYCLINE DRUGS , THEREFORE , SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT UNLESS OTHER DRUGS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE OR ARE CONTRAINDICATED .
All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone - forming tissue .
A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg / kg every six hours .
This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued .
Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta , are found in fetal tissues , and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus ( often related to retardation of skeletal development ) .
Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy .
The anti - anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN .
While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function , in patients with significantly impaired function , higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia , hyperphosphatemia , and acidosis .
Under such conditions , monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended , and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours .
( See . )
If renal impairment exists , even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines .
This has been reported with minocycline .
Central nervous system side effects including light - headedness , dizziness , or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy .
Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy .
These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued .
associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including minocycline , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of Clostridium difficileC .
difficile .
produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
C . difficileC .
difficile If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibiotic use not directed against may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibiotic treatment of and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
C . difficileC .
difficile , PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations , use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non - susceptible organisms , including fungi .
If superinfection occurs , the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted .
Pseudotumor cerebri ( benign intracranial hypertension ) in adults has been associated with the use of tetracyclines .
The usual clinical manifestations are headache and blurred vision .
Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants .
While both of these conditions and related symptoms usually resolve after discontinuation of the tetracycline , the possibility for permanent sequelae exists .
Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline ; therefore , minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs .
Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated .
Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria .
Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued .
Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics , patients can develop watery and bloody stools ( with or without stomach cramps and fever ) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic .
If this occurs , patients should contact their physician as soon as possible .
Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines .
Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs , and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema .
This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline .
Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy .

WARNINGS Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective .
( See . )
Drug Interactions Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections .
They do not treat viral infections ( e . g . , the common cold ) .
When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection , patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy , the medication should be taken exactly as directed .
Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may ( 1 ) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and ( 2 ) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future .
Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date .
Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected , a dark - field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months .
Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems , including hematopoietic , renal , and hepatic should be performed .
Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity , patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage .
Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin , it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline - class drugs in conjunction with penicillin .
Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum , calcium or magnesium , and iron - containing preparations .
The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity .
Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective .
Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before , during , and shortly after minocycline therapy .
Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri .
( See . )
PRECAUTIONS Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines .
Drug / Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long - term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production .
Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs .
In addition , there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic , oxytetracycline ( i . e . , adrenal and pituitary tumors ) .
Likewise , although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted , positive results in mammalian cell assays ( i . e . , mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells ) have been reported for related antibiotics ( tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline ) .
Segment I ( fertility and general reproduction ) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats .
in vitro Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects ( See . )
Pregnancy Category D . WARNINGS All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects , loss , or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women .
Minocycline , like other tetracycline - class antibiotics , crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in post - marketing experience .
Only limited information is available regarding these reports ; therefore , no conclusion on causal association can be established .
If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus .
Nonteratogenic Effects ( See . )
WARNINGS Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown .
Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
( See . )
WARNINGS Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks .
( See . )
WARNINGS Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
( See , . )
