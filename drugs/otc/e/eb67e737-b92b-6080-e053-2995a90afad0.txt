6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The data described below reflect exposure to ACCRUFER in 175 patients in the placebo - controlled phase of three randomized studies conducted in patients with anemia and quiescent inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) ( Studies AEGIS 1 & 2 ) or non - dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) ( AEGIS 3 ) .
The pooled patient population had a mean age of 58 years , 67 . 4 % were female ( n = 118 ) , and 81 . 7 % ( n = 143 ) were Caucasian .
Table 1 presents all adverse reactions occurring in the placebo - controlled period of the pooled randomized studies [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] occurring at a rate of > 1 % in the treated group , and for which the rate for ACCRUFER exceeds the rate for placebo .
Table 1 .

The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of ACCRUFER in these studies was abdominal pain ( 1 . 7 % of patients ) .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Dimercaprol : Avoid concomitant use .
( 7 . 2 ) • Oral Medications : Separate administration of ACCRUFER from certain oral medications .
Monitor clinical responses as appropriate .
( 7 . 1 , 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Effect of Other Drugs on ACCRUFER Oral Medications There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between ACCRUFER and concomitant oral medications .
Concomitant use of some drugs may reduce the bioavailability of iron after administration of ACCRUFER .
Separate the administration of ACCRUFER from these drugs .
The duration of separation may depend on the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered , such as time to peak concentration or whether the drug is an immediate or extended release product .
Monitor clinical response to ACCRUFER .
7 . 2 Effect of ACCRUFER on Other Drugs Dimercaprol Concomitant use of iron products with dimercaprol may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity .
Avoid concomitant use of ACCRUFER with dimercaprol .
Oral Medications Concomitant use of ACCRUFER may decrease the bioavailability of some drugs , including mycophenolate , ethinyl estradiol , ciprofloxacin and doxycycline [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
For oral drugs where reductions in bioavailability may cause clinically significant effects on its safety or efficacy , separate the administration of ACCRUFER by at least 4 hours .
Monitor clinical responses to concomitant drugs as appropriate .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary ACCRUFER is not absorbed systemically as an intact complex following oral administration , and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of ferric or ferrous compounds to gravid CD1 - mice and Wistar - rats during organogenesis at doses 13 to 32 times the recommended human dose resulted in no adverse developmental outcomes .
An overdose of iron in pregnant women may carry a risk for spontaneous abortion , gestational diabetes and fetal malformation .
In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of maltol to pregnant Crl : COBS - CD ( SD ) BR rats during organogenesis at doses 6 times the recommended human dose resulted in no adverse developmental outcomes .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - Associated Maternal and / or Embryo / Fetal Risk Untreated iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes such as post - partum anemia .
Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with IDA include increased risk for preterm delivery and low birth weight .
Data Animal Data In embryofetal development studies in mice and rats , pregnant animals received oral doses of ferric or ferrous compounds ( ferrous sulfate or ferric sodium pyrophosphate ) of up to 160 mg / kg / day in mice , or up to 200 mg / kg / day in rats , during the period of organogenesis .
Administration of ferric or ferrous compounds at doses 13 times ( in mice ) or 32 times ( in rats ) the recommended human dose resulted in no maternal toxicity and no adverse developmental outcomes .
In a multigeneration reproductive and developmental study in rats , pregnant animals received oral doses of maltol of 100 , 200 , and 400 mg / kg / day , during the period of organogenesis .
Administration of maltol at doses 6 times the recommended human dose resulted in no maternal toxicity and no adverse developmental outcomes .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ACCRUFER in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
ACCRUFER is not absorbed systemically as an intact complex by the mother following oral administration , and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to ACCRUFER .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ACCRUFER have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 295 patients in the randomized trials of ACCRUFER , 39 % of patients were aged 65 and older , while 23 % were aged 75 and older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients .
10 OVERDOSAGE No data are available regarding overdose of ACCRUFER in patients .
Acute iron ingestion of 20 mg / kg elemental iron is potentially toxic and 200 - 250 mg / kg is potentially fatal .
Early signs and symptoms of iron overdose may include nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain and diarrhea .
In more serious cases there may be evidence of hypoperfusion , metabolic acidosis and systemic toxicity .
Dosages of ACCRUFER in excess of iron needs may lead to accumulation of iron in storage sites leading to hemosiderosis .
Periodic monitoring of iron parameters such as serum ferritin and transferrin saturation may assist in recognizing iron accumulation .
Do not administer ACCRUFER to patients with iron overload [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action ACCRUFER delivers iron for uptake across the intestinal wall and transfer to transferrin and ferritin .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics ACCRUFER has been shown to increase serum iron parameters , including ferritin and transferrin saturation ( TSAT ) .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic properties of serum iron after administration of ACCRUFER was assessed in subjects with iron deficiency ( with or without anemia ) following a single dose and at steady state ( after 1 week ) of ACCRUFER 30 mg , 60 mg , or 90 mg twice daily ( 1 to 3 times the approved recommended dosage ) .
Total serum iron concentrations increase in a less than dose proportional manner with increasing ACCRUFER doses .
Absorption ACCRUFER dissociates upon uptake from the gastrointestinal tract allowing iron and maltol to be absorbed separately .
Total serum iron peak values were reached 1 . 5 to 3 hours after administration of ACCRUFER , and were comparable between Day 1 and Day 8 .
Effect of Food Food has been shown to decrease the bioavailability of iron after administration of ferric maltol .
Drug Interaction Studies In vitro Of the drugs screened for an interaction with ferric maltol in vitro at pH 1 . 2 , 4 . 5 and 6 . 8 , only mycophenolate and ethinyl estradiol showed any potential for interaction .
Mycophenolate recovery was reduced by up to 16 % at pH 1 . 2 but there was no interaction at pH 4 . 5 ; due to solubility issues data are not available for pH 6 . 8 .
Ethinyl estradiol recovery was reduced by up to 35 % at pH 4 . 5 ; due to solubility issues data are not available for pH 1 . 2 and pH 6 . 8 .
These potential oral interactions can be avoided by spacing the administration of those drugs and ACCRUFER [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Lisinopril , metoprolol and warfarin showed no interaction at any of the 3 pH conditions and can be taken with ACCRUFER .
No interaction with ferric maltol was observed for atorvastatin ( pH 6 . 8 ) , and norgestimate ( pH 1 . 2 ) ( data were not obtainable at the other pH conditions due to solubility issues ) .
In vivo No clinical studies evaluating the drug interaction potential of ACCRUFER have been conducted .
Iron - containing preparations may decrease ciprofloxacin absorption into the bloodstream , resulting in lower serum and urine levels and reduced effectiveness .
Absorption of tetracyclines including doxycycline is reported to be impaired by iron - containing preparations .
12 . 6 Maltol Phamacokinetics Maltol is metabolized through glucuronidation ( UGT1A6 ) and sulphation in vitro .
Of the total maltol ingested , a mean of between 39 . 8 % and 60 % was excreted in the urine as maltol glucuronide .
There was no clinically meaningful change in exposure of maltol or maltol glucuronide in subjects with non - dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease ( eGFR of > 15 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 and < 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 ) .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Ferric maltol ACCRUFER is not absorbed systemically as an intact complex .
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with ferric maltol .
Ferric maltol was mutagenic in vitro in reverse bacterial mutation ( Ames ) assays .
Ferric maltol increased revertant frequency in the absence and presence of metabolic activation .
Fertility studies have not been conducted with ferric maltol .
Maltol The carcinogenic potential of maltol has been evaluated in long - term animal toxicity studies in two species : CD - 1 mice and Sprague - Dawley rats .
Maltol was not carcinogenic in a 18 - month study in mice at doses up to 400 mg / kg ( approximately 5 times the human daily dose ) .
Maltol was not carcinogenic in a 2 - year study in rats at doses up to 400 mg / kg ( approximately 10 times the human daily dose ) .
Maltol was mutagenic in vitro in reverse bacterial mutation ( Ames ) assays .
Maltol increased revertant frequency in the absence and presence of metabolic activation .
Maltol was clastogenic in vivo in a mouse micronucleus assay ( increase in polychromatic erythrocytes ) at intraperitoneal doses of 774 mg / kg .
Absorbed maltol is rapidly conjugated with glucuronic acid .
It is therefore unlikely that the mutagenic activity of maltol would be expressed under the conditions of oral human intake .
In a multi - generation animal reproduction study in male and female rats , there were no effects on mating , fertility , or early embryonic development at doses up to 400 mg / kg / day ( approximately 10 times the human daily dose ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) The safety and efficacy of ACCRUFER for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia was studied in two randomized , placebo - controlled trials : AEGIS 1 ( NCT01252221 ) and AEGIS 2 ( NCT01340872 ) .
These trials enrolled 128 patients ( age range 18 - 76 years ; 45 males and 83 females ) with quiescent IBD ( 58 patients with Ulcerative Colitis [ UC ] and 70 patients with Crohns disease [ CD ] ) and baseline Hb concentrations between 9 . 5 g / dL and 12 / 13 g / dL for females / males and ferritin < 30 mcg / L .
All patients had discontinued prior oral ferrous product treatment due to lack of efficacy or inability to tolerate oral iron replacement products .
Subjects were randomized 1 : 1 to receive either 30 mg ACCRUFER twice daily or a matched placebo control for 12 weeks .
The major efficacy outcome was the mean difference in Hb concentration from baseline to week 12 between ACCRUFER and placebo .
The Least Square [ LS ] mean difference from baseline was 2 . 18 g / dL ( p < 0 . 0001 ) ( see Table 2 ) .
