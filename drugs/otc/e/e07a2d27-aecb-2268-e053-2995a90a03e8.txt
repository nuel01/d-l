Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly .
Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available .
[ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) , Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] 5 . 14 Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use , more often following greater than one month of use .
Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non - specific symptoms and signs including nausea , vomiting , anorexia , fatigue , weakness , dizziness , and low blood pressure .
If adrenal insufficiency is suspected , confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible .
If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed , treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids .
Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers .
Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency .
The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency .
5 . 15 Drug / Laboratory Test Interactions Because opioid agonists may increase biliary tract pressure , with resultant increase in plasma amylase or lipase levels , determination of these enzyme levels may be unreliable for 24 hours after administration of a dose of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described , or described in greater detail , in other sections : • Addiction , abuse , and misuse [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 . 3 ) ] • Life - threatening respiratory depression [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 3 , 5 . 4 , 5 . 8 ) , Overdosage ( 10 ) ] • Accidental overdose and death due to medication errors [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Decreased mental alertness with impaired mental and / or physical abilities [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Interactions with benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 , 7 . 5 ) ] • Paralytic ileus , gastrointestinal adverse reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] • Increased intracranial pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 ) ] • Obscured clinical course in patients with head injuries [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 ) ] • Seizures [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) ] • Severe hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 12 ) ] • Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 13 ) ] • Adrenal insufficiency [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 14 ) ] The following adverse reactions have been identified during clinical studies , in the literature , or during post - approval use of hydrocodone and / or chlorpheniramine .

( 7 . 9 ) • Anticholinergic drugs : Concomitant use may cause paralytic ileus .
( 5 . 9 , 7 . 10 ) 7 . 1 Alcohol Concomitant use of alcohol with Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension can result in an increase of hydrocodone plasma levels and potentially fatal overdose of hydrocodone .
Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or nonprescription products containing alcohol while on Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] 7 . 2 Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 The concomitant use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension and CYP3A4 inhibitors , such as macrolide antibiotics ( e . g . , erythromycin ) , azole - antifungal agents ( e . g . ketoconazole ) , or protease inhibitors ( e . g . , ritonavir ) , can increase the plasma concentration of hydrocodone , resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects .
These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension and CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors , particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension is achieved [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor , as the effects of the inhibitor decline , the hydrocodone plasma concentration will decrease [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to hydrocodone .
Avoid the use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension while taking a CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor .
If concomitant use is necessary , monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals .
7 . 3 CYP3A4 Inducers The concomitant use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension and CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin , carbamazepine , or phenytoin , can decrease the plasma concentration of hydrocodone [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to hydrocodone [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer , as the effects of the inducer decline , the hydrocodone plasma concentration will increase [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions and may cause serious respiratory depression .
Avoid the use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension in patients who are taking CYP3A4 inducers .
If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inducer is necessary , follow the patient for reduced efficacy .
7 . 4 Phenytoin Adverse event reports in the literature suggest a possible drug interaction involving increased serum phenytoin levels and phenytoin toxicity when chlorpheniramine and phenytoin are co - administered .
The exact mechanism for this interaction is not known , however it is believed that chlorpheniramine may inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin .
Avoid the use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension in patients who are taking phenytoin .
7 . 5 Benzodiazepines , and Other CNS Depressants Due to additive pharmacologic effect , the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants , including alcohol , other sedatives / hypnotics , anxiolytics , tranquilizers , muscle relaxants , general anesthetics , antipsychotics , and other opioids , can increase the risk of hypotension , respiratory depression , profound sedation , coma , and death .
Avoid the use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension in patients who are taking benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] and instruct patients to avoid consumption of alcohol while on Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) , Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
7 . 6 Serotonergic Drugs The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome .
If concomitant use is warranted , carefully observe the patient , particularly during treatment initiation .
Discontinue Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension if serotonin syndrome is suspected .
7 . 7 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors ( MAOIs ) Avoid the use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension in patients who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) or have taken MAOIs within 14 days .
The use of MAOIs or tricyclic antidepressants with hydrocodone , one of the active ingredients in Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension , may increase the effect of either the antidepressant or hydrocodone .
MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity ( e . g . , respiratory depression , coma ) .
7 . 8 Muscle Relaxants Hydrocodone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression .
Avoid the use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension in patients taking muscle relaxants .
If concomitant use is necessary , monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected .
7 . 9 Diuretics Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone .
Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and / or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed .
7 . 10 Anticholinergic Drugs The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs with Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension may increase risk of urinary retention and / or severe constipation , which may lead to paralytic ileus [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] .
Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs .
Additive adverse effects resulting from cholinergic blockade ( e . g . , xerostomia , blurred vision , or constipation ) may occur when anticholinergic drugs are administered with chlorpheniramine .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Avoid use in pregnant women .
May cause fetal harm .
( 8 . 1 ) • Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended .
( 8 . 2 ) • Renal Impairment : Use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment .
( 8 . 6 ) • Hepatic Impairment : Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
( 8 . 7 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension is not recommended for use in pregnant women , including during or immediately prior to labor .
Prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy may cause neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 13 ) , Clinical Considerations ] .
There are no available data with Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension use in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk for adverse developmental outcomes .
Published studies with hydrocodone have reported inconsistent findings and have important methodological limitations ( see Data ) .
Reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted with Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension ; however , studies are available with individual active ingredients or related active ingredients ( see Data ) .
In animal reproduction studies , hydrocodone administered by the subcutaneous route to pregnant hamsters during the period of organogenesis produced a teratogenic effect at a dose approximately 70 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) ( see Data ) .
Chlorpheniramine administered by the oral route to mice throughout pregnancy was embryolethal at a dose approximately 9 times the MRHD and decreased postnatal survival when dosing was continued after parturition .
Chlorpheniramine administered by the oral route to male and female rats prior to mating produced embryolethality at a dose approximately 9 times the MRHD ( see Data ) .
Based on the animal data , advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Fetal / Neonatal Adverse Reactions Prolonged use of opioid analgesics during pregnancy for medical or nonmedical purposes can result in physical dependence in the neonate and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome shortly after birth .
Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome presents as irritability , hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern , high pitched cry , tremor , vomiting , diarrhea and failure to gain weight .
The onset , duration , and severity of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome vary based on the specific opioid used , duration of use , timing and amount of last maternal use , and rate of elimination of the drug by the newborn .
Observe newborns for symptoms of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 13 ) ] .
Labor or Delivery Opioids cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and psycho - physiologic effects in neonates .
An opioid antagonist , such as naloxone , must be available for reversal of opioid - induced respiratory depression in the neonate .
Opioids , including Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension , can prolong labor through actions which temporarily reduce the strength , duration , and frequency of uterine contractions .
However , this effect is not consistent and may be offset by an increased rate of cervical dilation , which tends to shorten labor .
Monitor neonates exposed to opioids during labor for signs of excess sedation and respiratory depression .
Data Human Data Hydrocodone A limited number of pregnancies have been reported in published observational studies and postmarketing reports describing hydrocodone use during pregnancy .
However , these data cannot definitely establish or exclude any drug - associated risk during pregnancy .
Methodological limitations of these observational studies include small sample size and lack of details regarding dose , duration and timing of exposure .
Chlorpheniramine The majority of studies examining the use of chlorpheniramine in pregnancy did not find an association with an increased risk of congenital anomalies .
In the few studies reporting an association , there was no consistent pattern of malformations noted .
Animal Data Reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted with Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension ; however , studies are available with individual active ingredients or related active ingredients .
Hydrocodone In an embryofetal development study in pregnant hamsters dosed on gestation day 8 during the period of organogenesis , hydrocodone induced cranioschisis , a malformation , at approximately 70 times the MRHD ( on a mg / m 2 basis with a maternal subcutaneous dose of 102 mg / kg ) .
Reproductive toxicology studies were also conducted with codeine , an opiate related to hydrocodone .
In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rats dosed throughout the period of organogenesis , codeine increased resorptions and decreased fetal weights at a dose approximately 95 times the MRHD of hydrocodone ( on a mg / m 2 basis with a maternal oral dose of codeine at 120 mg / kg / day ) ; however , these effects occurred in the presence of maternal toxicity .
In embryofetal development studies with pregnant rabbits and mice dosed throughout the period of organogenesis , codeine produced no adverse developmental effects at doses approximately 50 and 240 times , respectively , the MRHD of hydrocodone ( on a mg / m 2 basis with maternal oral doses of codeine at 30 mg / kg / day in rabbits and 600 mg / kg / day in mice ) .
Chlorpheniramine In embryofetal development studies with pregnant rats and rabbits dosed throughout the period of organogenesis , chlorpheniramine produced no adverse developmental effects at oral doses up to approximately 35 and 45 times , respectively , the MRHD on a mg / m 2 basis .
However , in a reproduction study with pregnant mice dosed throughout pregnancy , chlorpheniramine produced embryolethality at a dose approximately 9 times the MRHD ( on a mg / m 2 basis with a maternal oral dose of 20 mg / kg / day ) and decreased postnatal survival when dosing was continued after parturition .
In a fertility and reproduction study with male and female rats dosed prior to mating , chlorpheniramine produced embryolethality at a dose approximately 9 times the MRHD ( on a mg / m 2 basis with an oral parental dose of 10 mg / kg / day ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions , including excess sedation , respiratory depression , and death in a breastfed infant , advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension .
There are no data on the presence of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension in human milk , the effects of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension on the breastfed infant , or the effects of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension on milk production ; however , data are available with hydrocodone and chlorpheniramine .
Hydrocodone Hydrocodone is present in breast milk .
Published cases report variable concentrations of hydrocodone and hydromorphone ( an active metabolite ) in breast milk with administration of immediate - release hydrocodone to nursing mothers in the early post - partum period with relative infant doses of hydrocodone ranging between 1 . 4 and 3 . 7 % .
There are case reports of excessive sedation and respiratory depression in breastfed infants exposed to hydrocodone .
No information is available on the effects of hydrocodone on milk production .
Chlorpheniramine Chlorpheniramine is present in human milk .
Chlorpheniramine has not been reported to cause effects on the breastfed infant .
The published literature suggests that chlorpheniramine may decrease milk production based on its anticholinergic effects .
( see Clinical Considerations ) Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension through breast milk should be monitored for excess sedation and respiratory depression .
Withdrawal symptoms can occur in breastfed infants when maternal administration of an opioid is stopped , or when breastfeeding is stopped .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Chronic use of opioids , such as hydrocodone , a component of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension , may cause reduced fertility in females and males of reproductive potential .
It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension is not indicated for use in patients younger than 18 years of age because the benefits of symptomatic treatment of cough associated with allergies or the common cold do not outweigh the risks for use of hydrocodone in these patients [ see Indications ( 1 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Life - threatening respiratory depression and death have occurred in children who received hydrocodone [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Because of the risk of life - threatening respiratory depression and death , Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension is contraindicated in children less than 6 years of age [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies have not been conducted with Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension in geriatric populations .
Use caution when considering the use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension in patients 65 years of age or older .
Elderly patients may have increased sensitivity to hydrocodone ; greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function ; or concomitant disease or other drug therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Respiratory depression is the chief risk for elderly patients treated with opioids , including Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension .
Respiratory depression has occurred after large initial doses of opioids were administered to patients who were not opioid - tolerant or when opioids were co - administered with other agents that depress respiration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 , 5 . 8 ) ] .
Hydrocodone is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , monitor these patients closely for respiratory depression , sedation , and hypotension .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension has not been characterized in patients with renal impairment .
Patients with renal impairment may have higher plasma concentrations than those with normal function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Chlorpheniramine is cleared substantially by the kidney .
As such , impaired renal function could potentially lead to the risk of decreased clearance and thereby increased retention or systemic levels of chlorpheniramine .
Therefore , Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension should be used with caution in patients with severe impairment of renal function , and patients should be monitored closely for signs of hydrocodone toxicity ( respiratory depression , sedation , and hypotension ) and chlorpheniramine toxicity .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension has not been characterized in patients with hepatic impairment .
Patients with severe hepatic impairment may have higher plasma concentrations than those with normal hepatic function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Chlorpheniramine is extensively metabolized by liver before elimination from the body .
As such , impaired hepatic function could potentially lead to the risk of decreased metabolism and thereby increased systemic levels of chlorpheniramine .
Therefore , Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension should be used with caution in patients with severe impairment of hepatic function , and patients should be monitored closely for signs of hydrocodone toxicity ( respiratory depression , sedation , and hypotension ) and chlorpheniramine toxicity .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9 . 1 Controlled Substance Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension contains hydrocodone bitartrate , a Schedule II controlled substance .
9 . 2 Abuse Hydrocodone Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension contains hydrocodone , a substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids including morphine and codeine .
Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension can be abused and is subject to misuse , addiction , and criminal diversion [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
All patients treated with opioids require careful monitoring for signs of abuse and addiction , since use of opioid analgesic and antitussive products carries the risk of addiction even under appropriate medical use .
Prescription drug abuse is the intentional non - therapeutic use of a prescription drug , even once , for its rewarding psychological or physiological effects .
Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral , cognitive , and physiological phenomena that develop after repeated substance use and includes : a strong desire to take the drug , difficulties in controlling its use , persisting in its use despite harmful consequences , a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations , increased tolerance , and sometimes a physical withdrawal .
“ Drug - seeking ” behavior is very common in persons with substance use disorders .
Drug - seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours , refusal to undergo appropriate examination , testing , or referral , repeated “ loss ” of prescriptions , tampering with prescriptions , and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating health care provider ( s ) .
“ Doctor shopping ” ( visiting multiple prescribers to obtain additional prescriptions ) is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction .
Preoccupation with achieving adequate pain relief can be appropriate behavior in a patient with poor pain control .
Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance .
Health care providers should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts .
In addition , abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction .
Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension , like other opioids , can be diverted for non - medical use into illicit channels of distribution .
Careful record - keeping of prescribing information , including quantity , frequency , and renewal requests , as required by state and federal law , is strongly advised .
Proper assessment of the patient , proper prescribing practices , periodic re - evaluation of therapy , and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs .
Risks Specific to Abuse of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension is for oral use only .
Abuse of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension poses a risk of overdose and death .
The risk is increased with concurrent use of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension with alcohol and other central nervous system depressants [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 , 7 . 5 ) ] .
Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV .
9 . 3 Dependence Psychological dependence , physical dependence , and tolerance may develop upon repeated administration of opioids ; therefore , Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension should be prescribed and administered for the shortest duration that is consistent with individual patient treatment goals and patients should be reevaluated prior to refills [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Physical dependence , the condition in which continued administration of the drug is required to prevent the appearance of a withdrawal syndrome , assumes clinically significant proportions only after several weeks of continued oral opioid use , although some mild degree of physical dependence may develop after a few days of opioid therapy .
If Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension is abruptly discontinued in a physically - dependent patient , a withdrawal syndrome may occur .
Withdrawal also may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity ( e . g . , naloxone , nalmefene ) , mixed agonist / antagonist analgesics ( e . g . , pentazocine , butorphanol , nalbuphine ) , or partial agonists ( e . g . , buprenorphine ) .
Some or all of the following can characterize this syndrome : restlessness , lacrimation , rhinorrhea , yawning , perspiration , chills , myalgia , and mydriasis .
Other signs and symptoms also may develop , including irritability , anxiety , backache , joint pain , weakness , abdominal cramps , insomnia , nausea , anorexia , vomiting , diarrhea , or increased blood pressure , respiratory rate , or heart rate .
Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical Presentation Hydrocodone Acute overdose with hydrocodone is characterized by respiratory depression ( a decrease in respiratory rate and / or tidal volume , Cheyne - Stokes respiration , cyanosis ) , extreme somnolence progressing to stupor or coma , skeletal muscle flaccidity , cold and clammy skin , constricted pupils , and , in some cases , pulmonary edema , bradycardia , partial or complete airway obstruction , atypical snoring , hypotension , circulatory collapse , cardiac arrest , and death .
Hydrocodone may cause miosis , even in total darkness .
Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic ( e . g . , pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origin may produce similar findings ) .
Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen with hypoxia in overdose situations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Chlorpheniramine Signs and symptoms of chlorpheniramine overdosage may vary from central nervous system depression to stimulation .
Central toxic effects are characterized by agitation , anxiety , delirium , disorientation , hallucinations , hyperactivity , sedation , and seizures .
Severe overdosage may produce coma , medullary paralysis , and death .
Peripheral toxicity includes hypertension , tachycardia , dysrhythmias , vasodilation , hyperpyrexia , mydriasis , urinary retention , and diminished gastrointestinal motility .
Atropine - like signs and symptoms ( dry mouth , fixed dilated pupils , flushing , tachycardia , hallucinations , gastrointestinal symptoms , convulsions , urinary retention , cardiac arrhythmias and coma ) may be observed .
Impaired secretion from sweat glands following toxic doses of drugs with anticholinergic side effects may predispose to hyperthermia .
Toxic psychosis , a possible class effect from overdose of sedating antihistamines , has been reported .
Treatment of Overdose Treatment of overdosage is driven by the overall clinical presentation and consists of discontinuation of Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension together with institution of appropriate therapy .
Give primary attention to the reestablishment of adequate respiratory exchange through provision of a patent and protected airway and the institution of assisted or controlled ventilation .
Employ other supportive measures ( including oxygen and vasopressors ) in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema as indicated .
Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias will require advanced life - support techniques .
Gastric emptying may be useful in removing unabsorbed drug .
The opioid antagonists , naloxone and nalmefene , are specific antidotes for respiratory depression resulting from opioid overdose .
For clinically significant respiratory or circulatory depression secondary to hydrocodone overdose , administer an opioid antagonist .
An antagonist should not be administered in the absence of clinically significant respiratory depression .
Because the duration of opioid reversal is expected to be less than the duration of action of hydrocodone in Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension , carefully monitor the patient until spontaneous respiration is reliably reestablished .
Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension will continue to release hydrocodone and add to the hydrocodone load for 12 hours or longer following ingestion , necessitating prolonged monitoring .
If the response to an opioid antagonist is suboptimal or only brief in nature , administer additional antagonist as directed by the product ’ s prescribing information .
Hemodialysis is not routinely used to enhance the elimination of hydrocodone or chlorpheniramine from the body .
Urinary excretion of chlorpheniramine is increased when the pH of the urine is acidic ; however , acid diuresis is NOT recommended to enhance elimination in overdose , as the risks of acidemia and acute tubular necrosis in patients with rhabdomyolysis far outweigh any potential benefits .

The precise mechanism of action of hydrocodone and other opiates is not known ; however , hydrocodone is believed to act centrally on the cough center .
In excessive doses , hydrocodone will depress respiration .
Chlorpheniramine Chlorpheniramine is a propylamine derivative antihistamine ( H1 - receptor antagonist ) of the alkylamine class that also possesses anticholinergic and sedative activity .
It prevents released histamine from dilating capillaries and causing edema of the respiratory mucosa .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Hydrocodone Effects on the Central Nervous System Hydrocodone produces respiratory depression by direct action on brain stem respiratory centers .
The respiratory depression involves a reduction in the responsiveness of the brain stem respiratory centers to both increases in carbon dioxide tension and to electrical stimulation .
Hydrocodone causes miosis , even in total darkness .
Pinpoint pupils are a sign of opioid overdose but are not pathognomonic ( e . g . , pontine lesions of hemorrhagic or ischemic origins may produce similar findings ) .
Marked mydriasis rather than miosis may be seen due to hypoxia in overdose situations .
Effects on the Gastrointestinal Tract and Other Smooth Muscle Hydrocodone causes a reduction in motility associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone in the antrum of the stomach and duodenum .
Digestion of food in the small intestine is delayed and propulsive contractions are decreased .
Propulsive peristaltic waves in the colon are decreased , while tone may be increased to the point of spasm resulting in constipation .
Other opioid - induced effects may include a reduction in biliary and pancreatic secretions , spasm of sphincter of Oddi , and transient elevations in serum amylase .
Effects on the Cardiovascular System Hydrocodone produces peripheral vasodilation which may result in orthostatic hypotension or syncope .
Manifestations of histamine release and / or peripheral vasodilation may include pruritus , flushing , red eyes and sweating and / or orthostatic hypotension .
Effects on the Endocrine System Opioids inhibit the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , cortisol , and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) in humans [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
They also stimulate prolactin , growth hormone ( GH ) secretion , and pancreatic secretion of insulin and glucagon .
Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic - pituitary - gonadal axis , leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido , impotence , erectile dysfunction , amenorrhea , or infertility .
The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical , physical , lifestyle , and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies conducted to date [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Effects on the Immune System Opioids have been shown to have a variety of effects on components of the immune system in in vitro and animal models .
The clinical significance of these findings is unknown .
Overall , the effects of opioids appear to be modestly immunosuppressive .
Concentration – Adverse Reaction Relationships There is a relationship between increasing hydrocodone plasma concentration and increasing frequency of dose - related opioid adverse reactions such as nausea , vomiting , CNS effects , and respiratory depression .
In opioid - tolerant patients , the situation may be altered by the development of tolerance to opioid - related adverse reactions .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following multiple dosing with Hydrocodone Polistirex and Chlorpheniramine Polistirex Extended - Release Oral Suspension , hydrocodone mean ( S . D . ) peak plasma concentrations of 22 . 8 ( 5 . 9 ) ng / mL occurred at 3 . 4 hours .
Food has no significant effect on the extent of absorption of hydrocodone .
Chlorpheniramine mean ( S . D . ) peak plasma concentrations of 58 . 4 ( 14 . 7 ) ng / mL occurred at 6 . 3 hours following multiple dosing .
Distribution Although the extent of protein binding of hydrocodone in human plasma has not been definitively determined , structural similarities to related opioid analgesics suggest that hydrocodone is not extensively protein bound .
As most agents in the 5 - ring morphinan group of semi - synthetic opioids bind plasma protein to a similar degree ( range 19 % [ hydromorphone ] to 45 % [ oxycodone ] ) , hydrocodone is expected to fall within this range .
Chlorpheniramine is widely distributed throughout the tissues of the body , including the central nervous system .
It reportedly has an apparent steady - state volume of distribution of approximately 3 . 2 L / kg in adults and children and is about 70 % bound to plasma proteins .
Chlorpheniramine and its metabolites likely cross the placental barrier and are excreted into human breast milk .
Elimination Metabolism Hydrocodone exhibits a complex pattern of metabolism , including N - demethylation , O - demethylation , and 6 keto reduction to the corresponding 6 - α - and 6 - β - hydroxy metabolites .
CYP3A4 mediated N - demethylation to norhydrocodone is the primary metabolic pathway of hydrocodone with a lower contribution from CYP2D6 mediated O - demethylation to hydromorphone .
Hydromorphone is formed from the O - demethylation of hydrocodone and may contribute to the total analgesic effect of hydrocodone .
Therefore , the formation of these and related metabolites can , in theory , be affected by other drugs [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Published in vitro studies have shown that N - demethylation of hydrocodone to form norhydrocodone can be attributed to CYP3A4 while O - demethylation of hydrocodone to hydromorphone is predominantly catalyzed by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by an unknown low affinity CYP enzyme .
Chlorpheniramine is rapidly and extensively metabolized via demethylation in the liver , forming mono - and didesmethyl derivatives .
Oxidative metabolism of chlorpheniramine is catalyzed by cytochrome P - 450 2D6 .
Excretion Hydrocodone and its metabolites are eliminated primarily in the kidneys .
The mean plasma half - life of hydrocodone is approximately 4 hours .
Chlorpheniramine and its metabolites are primarily excreted through the kidneys , with large individual variation .
Urinary excretion depends on urine pH and flow rate .
The mean plasma half - life of chlorpheniramine is approximately 21 - 24 hours .
