7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • See full prescribing information for details regarding concomitant use of pravastatin sodium with other drugs that increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis .
( 2 . 5 , 7 . 1 ) • Bile Acid Sequestrants : in patients taking a bile acid sequestrant , administer pravastatin sodium tablets at least 1 hour before or at least 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant ( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Drug Interactions that Increases the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with pravastatin sodium Pravastatin sodium is a substrate of the transport protein OATP1B1 .
Pravastatin sodium plasma levels can be significantly increased with concomitant administration of inhibitors of OATP1B1 .
Table 3 includes a list of drugs that increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when used concomitantly with pravastatin sodium and instructions for preventing or managing them [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Table 3 : Drug Interactions that Increase the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with Pravastatin Sodium Tablets Gemfibrozil Clinical Impact : There is an increased risk of myopathy / rhabdomyolysis when pravastatin sodium is administered with gemfibrozil Intervention : Avoid concomitant use of gemfibrozil with pravastatin sodium Cyclosporine Clinical Impact : The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of cyclosporine with pravastatin sodium .
Intervention : Initiate with a dosage of pravastatin sodium 10 mg once daily .
Do not exceed pravastatin sodium 20 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Select Macrolide Antibiotics Clinical Impact : The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant use of clarithromycin or erythromycin with pravastatin sodium .
Other macrolides ( e . g . , azithromycin ) have the potential to increase pravastatin sodium exposures and increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when used concomintantly .
Intervention : For patients taking erythromycin or clarithromycin , do not exceed 40 mg pravastatin sodium once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Niacin Clinical Impact : Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been observed with concomitant use of niacin with pravastatin sodium .
Intervention : Consider if the benefit of using niacin concomitantly with pravastatin sodium outweigh the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis .
If concomitant use is decided , monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy , particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug .
Fibrates ( other than Gemfibrozil ) Clinical Impact : Fibrates may cause myopathy when given alone .
The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of fibrates with pravastatin sodium .
Intervention : Consider if the benefit of using fibrates concomitantly with pravastatin sodium outweigh the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis .
If concomitant use is decided , monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy , particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug .
Colchicine Clinical Impact : Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with concomitant use of colchicine with pravastatin sodium .
Intervention : Consider if the benefit of using colchicine concomitantly with pravastatin sodium outweigh the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis .
If concomitant use is decided , monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy , particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug 7 . 2 Drug Interactions that Decrease the Efficacy of pravastatin sodium Table 4 presents drug interactions that may decrease the efficacy of pravastatin sodium and instructions for preventing or managing them .
Table 4 : Drug Interactions that Decrease the Efficacy of Pravastatin Sodium Bile Acid Sequestrants Clinical Impact : Concomitant cholestyramine or colestipol administration decreased the mean exposure of pravastatin approximately 51 % and 47 % , respectively [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention : In patients taking a bile acid sequestrant , administer pravastatin sodium tablets at least 1 hour before or at least 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm ( 8 . 1 ) • Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended during treatment with pravastatin sodium ( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Discontinue pravastatin sodium when pregnancy is recognized .
Alternatively , consider the ongoing therapeutic needs of the individual patient .
pravastatin sodium decreases synthesis of cholesterol and possibly other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol ; therefore , pravastatin sodium may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant patients based on the mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
In addition , treatment of hyperlipidemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy .
Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid - lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long - term therapy of primary hyperlipidemia for most patients .
Available data from case series and prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies over decades of use with statins in pregnant women have not identified a drug - associated risk of major congenital malformations .
Published data from prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies with pravastatin sodium use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine if there is a drug - associated risk of miscarriage ( see Data ) .
In animal reproduction studies , no evidence of fetal malformations was seen in pregnant rats or rabbits orally administered pravastatin during the period of organogenesis at doses that resulted in 10 times and 120 times , respectively , the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 80 mg / day , based on body surface area ( mg / m2 ) .
An imbalance in some fetal skeletal variations , increased offspring mortality , and developmental delays occurred when pregnant rats were exposed to 10 times to 12 times the MRHD during organogenesis to parturition ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data : A Medicaid cohort linkage study of 1152 statin - exposed pregnant women compared to 886 , 996 controls did not find a significant teratogenic effect from maternal use of statins in the first trimester of pregnancy , after adjusting for potential cofounders – including maternal age , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , obesity , and alcohol and tobacco use – using propensity score based methods .
The relative risk of congenital malformations between the group with statin use and the group with no statin use in the first trimester was 1 . 07 ( 95 % confidence interval 0 . 85 to 1 . 37 ) after controlling for confounders , particularly pre - existing diabetes mellitus .
There were also no statistically significant increases in any of the organ - specific malformations assessed after accounting for cofounders .
In the majority of pregnancies , statin treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified .
Study limitations include reliance on physician coding to define the presence of a malformation , lack of control for certain confounders such as body mass index , use of prescription dispensing as verification for the use of a statin , and lack of information on non - live births .
Animal Data : Embryo fetal and neonatal mortality was observed in rats given pravastatin during the period of organogenesis or during organogenesis continuing through weaning .
In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 4 , 20 , 100 , 500 , and 1000 mg / kg / day from gestation days 7 through 17 ( organogenesis ) increased mortality of offspring and increased cervical rib skeletal anomalies were observed at ≥ 100 mg / kg / day systemic exposure , 10 times the human exposure at 80 mg / day MRHD based on body surface area ( mg / m2 ) .
In other studies , no teratogenic effects were observed when pravastatin was dosed orally during organogenesis in rabbits ( gestation days 6 through 18 ) up to 50 mg / kg / day or in rats ( gestation days 7 through 17 ) up to 1000 mg / kg / day .
Exposures were 10 times ( rabbit ) or 120 times ( rat ) the human exposure at 80 mg / day MRHD based on body surface area ( mg / m2 ) .
In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 10 , 100 , and 1000 mg / kg / day from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21 ( weaning ) , developmental delays were observed at ≥ 100 mg / kg / day systemic exposure , corresponding to 12 times the human exposure at 80 mg / day MRHD , based on body surface area ( mg / m2 ) .
In pregnant rats , pravastatin crosses the placenta and is found in fetal tissue at 30 % of the maternal plasma levels following administration of a single dose of 20 mg / day orally on gestation day 18 , which corresponds to exposure 2 times the MRHD of 80 mg daily based on body surface area ( mg / m2 ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Based on one lactation study in published literature , pravastatin is present in human milk .
There is no available information on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production .
Statins , including pravastatin sodium , decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol and may cause harm to the breastfed infant .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant , based on the mechanism of action , advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with pravastatin sodium [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of pravastatin sodium as an adjunct to diet to reduce LDL - C have been established in pediatric patients 8 years of age and older with HeFH .
Use of pravastatin sodium for this indication is based on a double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical study in 214 pediatric patients ( 100 males and 114 females ) 8 years of age and older with HeFH .
Doses greater than 40 mg daily have not been studied in this population .
The safety and effectiveness of pravastatin sodium have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 10 years of age with HeFH or in pediatric patients with other types of hyperlipidemia ( other than HeFH ) .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In clinical studies , 4 , 797 ( 36 . 4 % ) pravastatin sodium - treated patients were aged 65 and older and 110 ( 0 . 8 % ) were aged 75 and older .
No significant differences in efficacy or safety were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients .
Mean pravastatin AUC ' s are 25 % - 50 % higher in elderly subjects than in healthy young subjects , but mean maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) , time to maximum plasma concentration ( Tmax ) , and half - life ( t ½ ) values are similar in both age groups and substantial accumulation of pravastatin would not be expected in the elderly [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Advanced age ( ≥ 65 years ) is a risk factor for pravastatin sodium - associated myopathy and rhabdomyolysis .
Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , recognizing the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of myopathy .
Monitor geriatric patients receiving pravastatin sodium for the increased risk of myopathy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Renal impairment is a risk factor for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis .
Monitor all patients with renal impairment for development of myopathy .
In patients with severe renal impairment , the recommended starting dose is pravastatin sodium 10 mg once daily .
The maximum recommended dosage in patients with severe renal impairment is pravastatin sodium 40 mg once daily .
The recommended dosage for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment is the same as patients with normal renal function .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Pravastatin sodium shows a large inter - subject variability in pharmacokinetics in patients with liver cirrhosis [ Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Pravastatin sodium is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .

11 DESCRIPTION Pravastatin sodium USP is a statin , an inhibitor of 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl - coenzyme A ( HMG - CoA ) reductase .
Pravastatin sodium is designated chemically as 1 - Naphthalene - heptanoic acid , 1 , 2 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 8 a - hexahydro - b , d , 6 - trihydroxy - 2 - methyl - 8 - ( 2 - methyl - 1 - oxobutoxy ) - , monosodium salt , [ 1 S - [ 1 a ( bS * , dS * ) , 2 a , 6 a , 8 b ( R * ) , 8aα ] ] - .
Structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Pravastatin sodium is an odorless , white to off - white , fine or crystalline powder .
It is a relatively polar hydrophilic compound with a partition coefficient ( octanol / water ) of 0 . 59 at a pH of 7 . 0 .
It is soluble in methanol and water ( > 300 mg / mL ) , slightly soluble in isopropanol , and practically insoluble in acetone , acetonitrile , chloroform , and ether .
Pravastatin sodium tablets USP for oral use contain 10 mg , 20 mg , 40 mg and 80 mg pravastatin sodium , which is equivalent to 9 . 48 , 18 . 97 , 37 . 94 and 75 . 88 mg of pravastatin , respectively .
Inactive ingredients include : colloidal silicon dioxide , crospovidone , hypromellose , iron oxide yellow , lactose monohydrate , magnesium stearate , polyethylene glycol , sodium bicarbonate , talc and titanium dioxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Pravastatin is a reversible inhibitor of HMG - CoA reductase , the rate - limiting enzyme that converts HMGCoA to mevalonate , a precursor of cholesterol .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Inhibition of HMG - CoA reductase by pravastatin accelerates the expression of LDL - receptors , followed by the uptake of LDL - C from blood to the liver , leading to a decrease in plasma LDL - C and total cholesterol .
Sustained inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver also decreases levels of very - low - density lipoproteins .
The maximum LDL - C reduction of pravastatin sodium tablets is usually achieved by 4 weeks and is maintained after that .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Pravastatin sodium is administered orally in the active form .
Peak plasma pravastatin concentrations occurred 1 to 1 . 5 hours upon oral administration .
Based on urinary recovery of total radiolabeled drug , the average oral absorption of pravastatin is 34 % and absolute bioavailability is 17 % .
While the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract reduces are under the concentration ( AUC ) and Cmax by 31 % and 49 % respectively , the lipid - lowering effects of the drug are similar whether taken with or 1 hour prior to meals .
Pravastatin plasma concentrations , including AUC , Cmax , and steady - state minimum ( Cmin ) , are directly proportional to administered dose .
Systemic bioavailability of pravastatin administered following a bedtime dose was decreased 60 % compared to that following an AM dose .
Despite this decrease in systemic bioavailability , the efficacy of pravastatin administered once daily in the evening , although not statistically significant , was marginally more effective than that after a morning dose .
The coefficient of variation ( CV ) , based on between - subject variability , was 50 % to 60 % for AUC .
The geometric means of pravastatin Cmax and AUC following a 20 mg dose in the fasted state were 26 . 5 ng / mL and 59 . 8 ng * hr / mL , respectively .
Steady - state AUCs , Cmax , and Cmin plasma concentrations showed no evidence of pravastatin accumulation following once or twice daily administration of pravastatin sodium tablets .
Distribution Approximately 50 % of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins .
Elimination Metabolism : The major biotransformation pathways for pravastatin are : ( a ) isomerization to 6 - epi pravastatin and the 3α - hydroxyisomer of pravastatin ( SQ 31 , 906 ) and ( b ) enzymatic ring hydroxylation to SQ 31 , 945 .
The 3α - hydroxyisomeric metabolite ( SQ 31 , 906 ) has 1 / 10 to 1 / 40 the HMG - CoA reductase inhibitory activity of the parent compound .
Pravastatin undergoes extensive first - pass extraction in the liver ( extraction ratio 0 . 66 ) .
Excretion : Approximately 20 % of a radiolabeled oral dose is excreted in urine and 70 % in the feces .
After intravenous administration of radiolabeled pravastatin to normal volunteers , approximately 47 % of total body clearance was via renal excretion and 53 % by non - renal routes ( i . e . , biliary excretion and biotransformation ) .
Following single dose oral administration of 14 C - pravastatin , the radioactive elimination t ½ for pravastatin is 1 . 8 hours in humans and the elimination half - life ( t ½ ) for total radioactivity ( pravastatin plus metabolites ) is 77 hours .
Specific Populations Renal Impairment : A single 20 mg oral dose of pravastatin was administered to 24 patients with varying degrees of renal impairment ( as determined by creatinine clearance ) .
No effect was observed on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin or its 3α - hydroxy isomeric metabolite ( SQ 31 , 906 ) .
Compared to healthy subjects with normal renal function , patients with severe renal impairment had 69 % and 37 % higher mean AUC and Cmax values , respectively , and a 0 . 61 hour shorter t ½ for the inactive enzymatic ring hydroxylation metabolite ( SQ 31 , 945 ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Hepatic Impairment : In a study comparing the kinetics of pravastatin in patients with biopsy confirmed cirrhosis ( N = 7 ) and normal subjects ( N = 7 ) , the mean AUC varied 18 - fold in cirrhotic patients and 5 - fold in healthy subjects .
Similarly , the peak pravastatin values varied 47 - fold for cirrhotic patients compared to 6 - fold for healthy subjects [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Geriatric : In a single oral dose study using pravastatin 20 mg , the mean AUC for pravastatin was approximately 27 % greater and the mean cumulative urinary excretion ( CUE ) approximately 19 % lower in elderly men ( 65 to 75 years old ) compared with younger men ( 19 to 31 years old ) .
In a similar study conducted in women , the mean AUC for pravastatin was approximately 46 % higher and the mean CUE approximately 18 % lower in elderly women ( 65 to 78 years old ) compared with younger women ( 18 to 38 years old ) .
In both studies , Cmax , Tmax , and t ½ values were similar in older and younger subjects [ See Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Pediatric : After 2 weeks of once - daily 20 mg oral pravastatin administration , the geometric means of AUC were 80 . 7 ( CV 44 % ) and 44 . 8 ( CV 89 % ) ng * hr / mL pediatric patients 8 to 11 years ( N = 14 ) and 12 to 16 years ( N = 10 ) , respectively .
The corresponding values for Cmax were 42 . 4 ( CV 54 % ) and 18 . 6 ng / mL ( CV 100 % ) for pediatric patients 8 to 11 years and 12 to 16 years , respectively .
No conclusion can be made based on these findings due to the small number of samples and large variability [ See Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .

These effects in rats were observed at approximately 12 times the human dose ( HD ) of 80 mg based on body surface area ( mg / m2 ) and at approximately 4 times the HD , based on AUC .
In a 2 - year study in mice fed pravastatin at doses of 250 and 500 mg / kg / day , there was an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in males and females at both 250 and 500 mg / kg / day ( p < 0 . 0001 ) .
At these doses , lung adenomas in females were increased ( p = 0 . 013 ) .
These effects in mice were observed at approximately 15 times ( 250 mg / kg / day ) and 23 times ( 500 mg / kg / day ) the HD of 80 mg , based on AUC .
In another 2 - year study in mice with doses up to 100 mg / kg / day ( producing drug exposures approximately 2 times the HD of 80 mg , based on AUC ) , there were no drug - induced tumors .
No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in vitro , with or without rat - liver metabolic activation , in the following studies : microbial mutagen tests , using mutant strains of Salmonella typhimurium or Escherichia coli ; a forward mutation assay in L5178Y TK + / − mouse lymphoma cells ; a chromosomal aberration test in hamster cells ; and a gene conversion assay using Saccharomyces cerevisiae .
In addition , there was no evidence of mutagenicity in either a dominant lethal test in mice or a micronucleus test in mice .
In a fertility study in adult rats with daily doses up to 500 mg / kg , pravastatin did not produce any adverse effects on fertility or general reproductive performance .
No adverse effects were seen in juvenile rats dosed with 5 mg / kg / day pravastatin ( 5 times plasma exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [ MRHD ] of 80 mg based on AUC ) in a study of pravastatin administered from postnatal days ( PND ) 4 through 80 at 5 , 15 and 45 mg / kg / day .
A PND 4 rat is generally comparable to a 3 rd trimester human fetus with regards to neurologic development / myelination .
At ≥ 15 mg / kg / day ( ≥ 20 times the MRHD ) , decreased body - weight gain was observed during the pre - weaning period and slight thinning of the corpus callosum was observed at the end of the drug - free recovery period ( PND 132 ) .
Thinning of the corpus callosum was not associated with any inflammatory or degenerative changes in the brain .
Impacts on neurobehavioral and learning endpoints were detected only at very high exposures ( 43 times the MRHD ) .
No thinning of the corpus callosum was observed in rats dosed with pravastatin for 3 months beginning on PND 35 at ≥ 250 mg / kg / day .
PND 35 in a rat is approximately equivalent to an 8 to 12 - year - old human child .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease In the pravastatin Primary Prevention Study ( WOS ) , the effect of Pravastatin sodium on fatal and nonfatal CHD was assessed in 6595 male patients 45 to 64 years of age , without a previous MI , and with LDL - C levels between 156 to 254 mg / dL .
In this randomized , double - blind , placebo controlled study , patients were treated with standard care , including dietary advice , and either pravastatin sodium 40 mg daily ( N = 3302 ) or placebo ( N = 3293 ) and followed for a median duration of 4 . 8 years .
Median ( 25 th , 75 th percentile ) percent changes from baseline after 6 months of pravastatin treatment in Total - C , LDL - C , TG , and HDL - C were − 20 . 3 ( − 26 . 9 , − 11 . 7 ) , − 27 . 7 ( − 36 . 0 , − 16 . 9 ) , − 9 . 1 ( − 27 . 6 , 12 . 5 ) , and 6 . 7 ( − 2 . 1 , 15 . 6 ) , respectively .
Pravastatin sodium significantly reduced the rate of first coronary events ( either CHD death or nonfatal MI ) by 31 % ( 248 events in the placebo group [ CHD death = 44 , nonfatal MI = 204 ] versus 174 events in the pravastatin sodium group [ CHD death = 31 , nonfatal MI = 143 ] , p = 0 . 0001 [ see figure below ] ) .
The risk reduction with pravastatin sodium was similar across the age range and throughout the entire range of baseline LDL cholesterol levels .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Pravastatin sodium also decreased the risk for undergoing myocardial revascularization procedures ( coronary artery bypass graft [ CABG ] surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [ PTCA ] ) by 37 % ( 80 vs 51 patients ) .
Cardiovascular deaths were decreased by 32 % ( 73 vs 50 ) and there was no increase in death from non - cardiovascular causes .
Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events In the LIPID study , the effect of pravastatin sodium , 40 mg daily , was assessed in 9014 patients ( 7498 men ; 1516 women ; 3514 patients ≥ 65 years ; 782 patients with diabetes ) who had experienced either an MI ( 5754 patients ) or had been hospitalized for unstable angina pectoris ( 3260 patients ) in the preceding 3 to 36 months .
Patients in this multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled study participated for an average of 5 . 6 years ( median of 5 . 9 years ) and at randomization had Total - C between 114 and 563 mg / dL ( mean 219 mg / dL ) , LDL - C between 46 and 274 mg / dL ( mean 150 mg / dL ) , TG between 35 and 2710 mg / dL ( mean 160 mg / dL ) , and HDL - C between 1 and 103 mg / dL ( mean 37 mg / dL ) .
At baseline , 82 % of patients were receiving aspirin and 76 % were receiving antihypertensive medication .
Treatment with pravastatin sodium significantly reduced the risk for total mortality by reducing coronary death ( see Table 7 ) .
The risk reduction due to treatment with pravastatin sodium on CHD mortality was consistent regardless of age .
pravastatin sodium significantly reduced the risk for total mortality ( by reducing CHD death ) and CHD events ( CHD mortality or nonfatal MI ) in patients who qualified with a history of either MI or hospitalization for unstable angina pectoris .

Patients in this double - blind , placebo - controlled study participated for an average of 4 . 9 years and had a mean baseline Total - C of 209 mg / dL .
LDL - C levels in this patient population ranged from 101 to 180 mg / dL ( mean 139 mg / dL ) .
At baseline , 84 % of patients were receiving aspirin and 82 % were taking antihypertensive medications .
Median ( 25 th , 75 th percentile ) percent changes from baseline after 6 months of pravastatin treatment in Total - C , LDL - C , TG , and HDL - C were − 22 . 0 ( − 28 . 4 , − 14 . 9 ) , − 32 . 4 ( − 39 . 9 , − 23 . 7 ) , − 11 . 0 ( − 26 . 5 , 8 . 6 ) , and 5 . 1 ( − 2 . 9 , 12 . 7 ) , respectively .
Treatment with pravastatin sodium significantly reduced the rate of first recurrent coronary events ( either CHD death or nonfatal MI ) , the risk of undergoing revascularization procedures ( PTCA , CABG ) , and the risk for stroke or TIA ( see Table 8 ) .
Table 8 : CARE - Primary and Secondary Endpoints a The risk reduction due to treatment with pravastatin was consistent in both sexes .

The pediatric patients aged 8 to 13 years were randomized to placebo ( N = 63 ) or 20 mg of pravastatin daily ( N = 65 ) and the pediatric patients aged 14 to 18 years were randomized to placebo ( N = 45 ) or 40 mg of pravastatin daily ( N = 41 ) .
Inclusion in the study required an LDL - C level > 95 th percentile for age and sex and one parent with either a clinical or molecular diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia .
The mean baseline LDL - C value was 239 mg / dL and 237 mg / dL in the pravastatin ( range : 151 to 405 mg / dL ) and placebo ( range : 154 to 375 mg / dL ) groups , respectively .
Pravastatin sodium significantly decreased plasma levels of LDL - C , Total - C , and ApoB in both pediatric age groups ( see Table 12 ) .
The effect of pravastatin treatment in the 2 age groups was similar .
