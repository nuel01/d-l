WARNING : DRUG - DRUG INTERACTIONS LEADING TO POTENTIALLY SERIOUS AND / OR LIFE THREATENING REACTIONS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning .
Co - administration of ritonavir with several classes of drugs including sedative hypnotics , antiarrhythmics , or ergot alkaloid preparations may result in potentially serious and / or life - threatening adverse events due to possible effects of ritonavir on the hepatic metabolism of certain drugs .
Review medications taken by patients prior to prescribing ritonavir or when prescribing other medications to patients already taking ritonavir .
( 4 , 5 . 1 ) 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ritonavir tablets are indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV - 1 infection .
Ritonavir tablets are an HIV protease inhibitor indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV - 1 infection .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • • Adult patients : 600 mg twice - daily with meals .
( 2 . 3 ) • • Pediatric patients : The recommended twice daily dose for children greater than one month of age is based on body surface area and should not exceed 600 mg twice daily with meals .
( 2 . 4 ) • • Ritonavir oral solution should not be administered to neonates before a postmenstrual age ( first day of the mother ’ s last menstrual period to birth plus the time elapsed after birth ) of 44 weeks has been attained .
( 2 . 4 , 5 . 2 ) • • Ritonavir oral powder can only be used for dosing increments of 100 mg .
( 2 . 4 ) • • Dose modification for ritonavir is necessary when used with other protease inhibitors .
( 2 . 6 ) 2 . 1 General Administration Recommendations • • Ritonavir must be used in combination with other antiretroviral agents .
• • Ritonavir is administered orally .
Ritonavir tablets should be swallowed whole , and not chewed , broken or crushed .
Take ritonavir with meals .
General Dosing Guidelines : Patients who take the 600 mg twice daily soft gel capsule ritonavir dose may experience more gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain or diarrhea when switching from the soft gel capsule to the tablet formulation because of greater maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) achieved with the tablet formulation relative to the soft gel capsule [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Patients should also be aware that these adverse events ( gastrointestinal or paresthesias ) may diminish as therapy is continued .
2 . 3 Dosage Recommendations in Adults Recommended Dosage for Treatment of HIV - 1 : The recommended dosage of ritonavir is 600 mg twice daily by mouth to be taken with meals .
Use of a dose titration schedule may help to reduce treatment - emergent adverse events while maintaining appropriate ritonavir plasma levels .
Ritonavir should be started at no less than 300 mg twice daily and increased at 2 to 3 day intervals by 100 mg twice daily .
The maximum dose of 600 mg twice daily should not be exceeded upon completion of the titration [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
Pregnant Women : Ritonavir oral solution is not recommended during pregnancy due to its ethanol content .
Ritonavir oral solution contains the excipients ethanol ( approx .
43 % v / v ) and propylene glycol ( approx .
27 % w / v ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 4 Dosage Recommendations in Pediatric Patients Ritonavir must be used in combination with other antiretroviral agents [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
The recommended dosage of ritonavir in pediatric patients older than 1 month is 350 to 400 mg per m2 twice daily by mouth to be taken with meals and should not exceed 600 mg twice daily .
Ritonavir should be started at 250 mg per m2 twice daily and increased at 2 to 3 day intervals by 50 mg per m2 twice daily .
If patients do not tolerate 400 mg per m2 twice daily due to adverse events , the highest tolerated dose may be used for maintenance therapy in combination with other antiretroviral agents , however , alternative therapy should be considered [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
Pediatric Dosage Guidelines for Oral Solution : Ritonavir oral solution should not be administered to neonates before a postmenstrual age ( first day of the mother ’ s last menstrual period to birth plus the time elapsed after birth ) of 44 weeks has been attained [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Ritonavir oral solution contains the excipients ethanol ( approx .
43 % v / v ) and propylene glycol ( approx .
27 % w / v ) .
Special attention should be given to accurate calculation of the dose of ritonavir , transcription of the medication order , dispensing information and dosing instructions to minimize the risk for medication errors , and overdose .
This is especially important for young children .
Total amounts of ethanol and propylene glycol from all medicines that are to be given to pediatric patients 1 to 6 months of age should be taken into account in order to avoid toxicity from these excipients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
When possible , dose should be administered using a calibrated dosing syringe .

Body surface area ( BSA ) can be calculated as follows1 : • [ MULTIMEDIA ] Pediatric Dosage Guidelines for Oral Powder : Ritonavir oral powder should be used only for dosing increments of 100 mg .
Ritonavir powder should not be used for doses less than 100 mg or for incremental doses between 100 mg intervals .
Ritonavir oral solution is the preferred formulation for patients requiring doses less than 100 mg or incremental doses between 100 mg intervals .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 2 . 6 Dose Modification due to Drug Interaction Dose reduction of ritonavir is necessary when used with other protease inhibitors : atazanavir , darunavir , fosamprenavir , saquinavir , and tipranavir .
Prescribers should consult the full prescribing information and clinical study information of these protease inhibitors if they are co - administered with a reduced dose of ritonavir [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Ritonavir Tablets USP , 100 mg are a white - colored , oval shaped , shallow , film - coated tablet with " 54 " debossed on one side and " 247 " debossed on the other side .

( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The following have been observed in patients receiving ritonavir : • • The concomitant use of ritonavir and certain other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions .
Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions .
( 5 . 1 , 7 . 2 ) • • Toxicity in preterm neonates : Ritonavir oral solution should not be used in preterm neonates in the immediate postnatal period because of possible toxicities .
A safe and effective dose of Ritonavir oral solution in this patient population has not been established .
( 2 . 4 , 5 . 2 ) • • Hepatotoxicity : Fatalities have occurred .
Monitor liver function before and during therapy , especially in patients with underlying hepatic disease , including hepatitis B and hepatitis C , or marked transaminase elevations .
( 5 . 3 , 8 . 6 ) • • Pancreatitis : Fatalities have occurred ; suspend therapy as clinically appropriate .
( 5 . 4 ) • • Allergic Reactions / Hypersensitivity : Allergic reactions have been reported and include anaphylaxis , toxic epidermal necrolysis , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , bronchospasm and angioedema .
Discontinue treatment if severe reactions develop .
( 5 . 5 , 6 . 2 ) • • PR interval prolongation may occur in some patients .
Cases of second and third degree heart block have been reported .
Use with caution with patients with preexisting conduction system disease , ischemic heart disease , cardiomyopathy , underlying structural heart disease or when administering with other drugs that may prolong the PR interval .
( 5 . 6 , 12 . 3 ) • • Total cholesterol and triglycerides elevations : Monitor prior to therapy and periodically thereafter .
( 5 . 7 ) • • Patients may develop new onset or exacerbations of diabetes mellitus , hyperglycemia .
( 5 . 8 ) • • Patients may develop immune reconstitution syndrome .
( 5 . 9 ) • • Patients may develop redistribution / accumulation of body fat .
( 5 . 10 ) • • Hemophilia : Spontaneous bleeding may occur , and additional factor VIII may be required .
( 5 . 11 ) 5 . 1 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions • Initiation of ritonavir , a CYP3A inhibitor , in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving ritonavir , may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A .
Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of ritonavir , respectively .
These interactions may lead to : • • Clinically significant adverse reactions , potentially leading to severe , life - threatening , or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications .
• • Clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of ritonavir .
• • Loss of therapeutic effect of ritonavir and possible development of resistance .
• When co - administering ritonavir with other protease inhibitors , see the full prescribing information for that protease inhibitor including important Warnings and Precautions .
• See Table 4 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions , including dosing recommendations [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during ritonavir therapy ; review concomitant medications during ritonavir therapy , and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
5 . 2 Toxicity in Preterm Neonates Ritonavir oral solution contains the excipients ethanol ( approx .
43 % v / v ) and propylene glycol ( approx .
27 % w / v ) .
When administered concomitantly with propylene glycol , ethanol competitively inhibits the metabolism of propylene glycol , which may lead to elevated concentrations .
Preterm neonates may be at an increased risk of propylene glycol - associated adverse events due to diminished ability to metabolize propylene glycol , thereby leading to accumulation and potential adverse events .
Postmarketing life - threatening cases of cardiac toxicity ( including complete AV block , bradycardia , and cardiomyopathy ) , lactic acidosis , acute renal failure , CNS depression and respiratory complications leading to death have been reported , predominantly in preterm neonates receiving lopinavir / ritonavir oral solution which also contains the excipients ethanol and propylene glycol .
Ritonavir oral solution should not be used in preterm neonates in the immediate postnatal period because of possible toxicities .
However , if the benefit of using ritonavir oral solution to treat HIV infection in infants immediately after birth outweighs the potential risks , infants should be monitored closely for increases in serum osmolality and serum creatinine , and for toxicity related to ritonavir oral solution including : hyperosmolality , with or without lactic acidosis , renal toxicity , CNS depression ( including stupor , coma , and apnea ) , seizures , hypotonia , cardiac arrhythmias and ECG changes , and hemolysis .
Total amounts of ethanol and propylene glycol from all medicines that are to be given to infants should be taken into account in order to avoid toxicity from these excipients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
5 . 3 Hepatotoxicity Hepatic transaminase elevations exceeding 5 times the upper limit of normal , clinical hepatitis , and jaundice have occurred in patients receiving ritonavir alone or in combination with other antiretroviral drugs ( see Table 3 ) .
There may be an increased risk for transaminase elevations in patients with underlying hepatitis B or C . Therefore , caution should be exercised when administering ritonavir to patients with pre - existing liver diseases , liver enzyme abnormalities , or hepatitis .
Increased AST / ALT monitoring should be considered in these patients , especially during the first three months of ritonavir treatment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
There have been postmarketing reports of hepatic dysfunction , including some fatalities .
These have generally occurred in patients taking multiple concomitant medications and / or with advanced AIDS .
5 . 4 Pancreatitis Pancreatitis has been observed in patients receiving ritonavir therapy , including those who developed hypertriglyceridemia .
In some cases fatalities have been observed .
Patients with advanced HIV disease may be at increased risk of elevated triglycerides and pancreatitis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
Pancreatitis should be considered if clinical symptoms ( nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain ) or abnormalities in laboratory values ( such as increased serum lipase or amylase values ) suggestive of pancreatitis should occur .
Patients who exhibit these signs or symptoms should be evaluated and ritonavir therapy should be discontinued if a diagnosis of pancreatitis is made .
5 . 5 Allergic Reactions / Hypersensitivity Allergic reactions including urticaria , mild skin eruptions , bronchospasm , and angioedema have been reported .
Cases of anaphylaxis , toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , and Stevens - Johnson syndrome have also been reported .
Discontinue treatment if severe reactions develop .
5 . 6 PR Interval Prolongation Ritonavir prolongs the PR interval in some patients .
Post marketing cases of second or third degree atrioventricular block have been reported in patients .
Ritonavir should be used with caution in patients with underlying structural heart disease , preexisting conduction system abnormalities , ischemic heart disease , cardiomyopathies , as these patients may be at increased risk for developing cardiac conduction abnormalities .
The impact on the PR interval of co - administration of ritonavir with other drugs that prolong the PR interval ( including calcium channel blockers , beta - adrenergic blockers , digoxin and atazanavir ) has not been evaluated .
As a result , co - administration of ritonavir with these drugs should be undertaken with caution , particularly with those drugs metabolized by CYP3A .
Clinical monitoring is recommended [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 7 Lipid Disorders Treatment with ritonavir therapy alone or in combination with saquinavir has resulted in substantial increases in the concentration of total cholesterol and triglycerides [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Triglyceride and cholesterol testing should be performed prior to initiating ritonavir therapy and at periodic intervals during therapy .
Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate , taking into account any potential drug - drug interactions with ritonavir and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
5 . 8 Diabetes Mellitus / Hyperglycemia New onset diabetes mellitus , exacerbation of pre - existing diabetes mellitus , and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV - infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy .
Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events .
In some cases , diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred .
In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy , hyperglycemia persisted in some cases .
Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice , estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established .
Consider monitoring for hyperglycemia , new onset diabetes mellitus , or an exacerbation of diabetes mellitus in patients treated with ritonavir .
5 . 9 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in HIV - infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy , including ritonavir .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia , or tuberculosis ) , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
Autoimmune disorders ( such as Graves ’ disease , polymyositis , and Guillain - Barré syndrome ) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution , however , the time to onset is more variable , and can occur many months after initiation of treatment .
5 . 10 Fat Redistribution Redistribution / accumulation of body fat including central obesity , dorsocervical fat enlargement ( buffalo hump ) , peripheral wasting , facial wasting , breast enlargement , and " cushingoid appearance " have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy .
The mechanism and long - term consequences of these events are currently unknown .
A causal relationship has not been established .
5 . 11 Patients with Hemophilia There have been reports of increased bleeding , including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis , in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors .
In some patients additional factor VIII was given .
In more than half of the reported cases , treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced .
A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established .
5 . 12 Resistance / Cross - resistance Varying degrees of cross - resistance among protease inhibitors have been observed .
Continued administration of ritonavir 600 mg twice daily following loss of viral suppression may increase the likelihood of cross - resistance to other protease inhibitors [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 13 Laboratory Tests Ritonavir has been shown to increase triglycerides , cholesterol , SGOT ( AST ) , SGPT ( ALT ) , GGT , CPK , and uric acid .
Appropriate laboratory testing should be performed prior to initiating ritonavir therapy and at periodic intervals or if any clinical signs or symptoms occur during therapy .

Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients : Ritonavir has been studied in 265 pediatric patients greater than 1 month to 21 years of age .
The adverse event profile observed during pediatric clinical trials was similar to that for adult patients .
Vomiting , diarrhea , and skin rash / allergy were the only drug - related clinical adverse events of moderate to severe intensity observed in greater than or equal to 2 % of pediatric patients enrolled in ritonavir clinical trials .
Laboratory Abnormalities in Pediatric Patients : The following Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities occurred in greater than 3 % of pediatric patients who received treatment with ritonavir either alone or in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors : neutropenia ( 9 % ) , hyperamylasemia ( 7 % ) , thrombocytopenia ( 5 % ) , anemia ( 4 % ) , and elevated AST ( 3 % ) .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse events ( not previously mentioned in the labeling ) have been reported during post - marketing use of ritonavir .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to ritonavir exposure .
Body as a Whole : Dehydration , usually associated with gastrointestinal symptoms , and sometimes resulting in hypotension , syncope , or renal insufficiency has been reported .
Syncope , orthostatic hypotension , and renal insufficiency have also been reported without known dehydration .
Co - administration of ritonavir with ergotamine or dihydroergotamine has been associated with acute ergot toxicity characterized by vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues including the central nervous system .
Cardiovascular System : First - degree AV block , second - degree AV block , third - degree AV block , right bundle branch block have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
Cardiac and neurologic events have been reported when ritonavir has been co - administered with disopyramide , mexiletine , nefazodone , fluoxetine , and beta blockers .
The possibility of drug interaction cannot be excluded .
Endocrine System : Cushing ' s syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported when ritonavir has been co - administered with fluticasone propionate or budesonide .
Nervous System : There have been postmarketing reports of seizure .
Also , see Cardiovascular System .
Renal and Urinary Disorders : Nephrolithiasis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) has been reported .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS When co - administering ritonavir with other protease inhibitors ( atazanavir , darunavir , fosamprenavir , saquinavir , and tipranavir ) , see the full prescribing information for that protease inhibitor including important information for drug interactions .
• • Co - administration of ritonavir can alter the concentrations of other drugs .
The potential for drug - drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy .
( 4 , 5 . 1 , 7 , 12 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Potential for Ritonavir to Affect Other Drugs Ritonavir is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3 A ( CYP3A ) and may increase plasma concentrations of agents that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A .
Agents that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A and have high first pass metabolism appear to be the most susceptible to large increases in AUC ( greater than 3 - fold ) when co - administered with ritonavir .
Thus , co - administration of ritonavir with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and / or life - threatening events is contraindicated .
Co - administration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring as shown in Table 4 .
Ritonavir also inhibits CYP2D6 to a lesser extent .
Co - administration of substrates of CYP2D6 with ritonavir could result in increases ( up to 2 - fold ) in the AUC of the other agent , possibly requiring a proportional dosage reduction .
Ritonavir also appears to induce CYP3A , CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , and CYP2B6 as well as other enzymes , including glucuronosyl transferase .
These examples are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may interact with ritonavir .
The healthcare provider should consult appropriate references for comprehensive information .
7 . 2 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Table 4 provides a list of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions .
Alteration in dose or regimen may be recommended based on drug interaction studies or predicted interaction [ seeContraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] for magnitude of interaction .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS When co - administering ritonavir with other protease inhibitors , see the full prescribing information for the co - administered protease inhibitor including important information for use in special populations .
• • Lactation : Women infected with HIV should be instructed not to breastfeed due to the potential for HIV transmission .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry : There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ritonavir during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry ( APR ) at 1 – 800 – 258 – 4263 .
Risk Summary : Prospective pregnancy data from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry ( APR ) are not sufficient to adequately assess the risk of birth defects or miscarriage .
Available data from the APR show no difference in the rate of overall birth defects for ritonavir compared to the background rate for major birth defects of 2 . 7 % in the U . S . reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program ( MACDP ) [ see Data ] .
In animal reproduction studies , no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed with oral administration of ritonavir to pregnant rats and rabbits .
During organogenesis in the rat and rabbit , systemic exposure ( AUC ) was approximately 1 / 3 lower than human exposure at the recommended daily dose .
In the rat pre - and post - natal developmental study , maternal systemic exposure to ritonavir was approximately 1 / 2 of the exposure in humans at the recommended daily dose , based on a body surface area conversion factor [ see Data ] .
Ritonavir oral solution is not recommended during pregnancy because there is no known safe level of ethanol exposure during pregnancy [ see Clinical Considerations , Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations : Dose Adjustments During Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period : Ritonavir oral solution contains approx .
43 % ethanol ( v / v ) and approx .
27 % ( w / v ) propylene glycol and is not recommended during pregnancy because there is no known safe level of ethanol exposure during pregnancy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Data : Human Data : Based on prospective reports to the APR of approximately 6 , 100 live births following exposure to ritonavir - containing regimens ( including over 2 , 800 live births exposed in the first trimester and over 3 , 200 live births exposed in the second and third trimesters ) , there was no difference in the rate of overall birth defects for ritonavir compared with the background birth defect rate of 2 . 7 % in the U . S . reference population of the MACDP .
The prevalence of birth defects in live births was 2 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 7 % to 2 . 9 % ) following first - trimester exposure to ritonavir - containing regimens and 2 . 9 % ( 95 % CI : 2 . 3 % to 3 . 5 % ) following second and third trimester exposure to ritonavir - containing regimens .
While placental transfer of ritonavir and fetal ritonavir concentrations are generally low , detectable levels have been observed in cord blood samples and neonate hair .
Animal Data : Ritonavir was administered orally to pregnant rats ( at 0 , 15 , 35 , and 75 mg / kg / day ) and rabbits ( at 0 , 25 , 50 , and 110 mg / kg / day ) during organogenesis ( on gestation days 6 through 17 and 6 through 19 , respectively ) .
No evidence of teratogenicity due to ritonavir was observed in rats and rabbits at doses producing systemic exposures ( AUC ) equivalent to approximately 1 / 3 lower than human exposure at the recommended daily dose .
Developmental toxicity observed in rats ( early resorptions , decreased fetal body weight and ossification delays and developmental variations ) occurred at a maternally toxic dose , at an exposure equivalent to approximately 1 / 3 lower than human exposure at the recommended daily dose .
A slight increase in the incidence of cryptorchidism was also noted in rats ( at a maternally toxic dose ) at an exposure approximately 1 / 5 lower than human exposure at the recommended daily dose .
Developmental toxicity was observed in rabbits ( resorptions , decreased litter size and decreased fetal weights ) at maternally toxic doses approximately 1 . 8 times higher than the recommended daily dose , based on a body surface area conversion factor .
In pre - and postnatal development study in rats , ritonavir was administered at doses of 0 , 15 , 35 , and 60 mg / kg / day from gestation day 6 through postnatal day 20 .
At doses of 60 mg / kg / day , no developmental toxicity was noted with ritonavir dosage equivalent to 1 / 2 of the recommended daily dose , based on a body surface area conversion factor .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary : The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV - infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV .
Limited published data reports that ritonavir is present in human milk .
There is no information on the effects of ritonavir on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production .
Because of the potential for ( 1 ) HIV transmission ( in HIV - negative infants ) , ( 2 ) developing viral resistance ( in HIV - positive infants ) and ( 3 ) serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant , instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving ritonavir .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception : Use of ritonavir may reduce the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives .
Advise patients using combined hormonal contraceptives to use an effective alternative contraceptive method or an additional barrier method of contraception [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use In HIV - infected patients age greater than 1 month to 21 years , the antiviral activity and adverse event profile seen during clinical trials and through postmarketing experience were similar to that for adult patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ritonavir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment of ritonavir is necessary for patients with either mild ( Child - Pugh Class A ) or moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B ) hepatic impairment .
No pharmacokinetic or safety data are available regarding the use of ritonavir in subjects with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) , therefore , ritonavir is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Acute Overdosage - Human Overdose Experience : Human experience of acute overdose with ritonavir is limited .
One patient in clinical trials took ritonavir 1 , 500 mg per day for two days .
The patient reported paresthesias which resolved after the dose was decreased .
A post - marketing case of renal failure with eosinophilia has been reported with ritonavir overdose .
The approximate lethal dose was found to be greater than 20 times the related human dose in rats and 10 times the related human dose in mice .
Management of Overdosage : Ritonavir oral solution contains approx .
43 % ethanol ( v / v ) and approx .
27 % ( w / v ) propylene glycol .
Ingestion of the product over the recommended dose by a young child could result in significant toxicity and could potentially be lethal .
Treatment of overdose with ritonavir consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient .
There is no specific antidote for overdose with ritonavir .
If indicated , elimination of unabsorbed drug should be achieved by gastric lavage ; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway .
Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid in removal of unabsorbed drug .
Since ritonavir is extensively metabolized by the liver and is highly protein bound , dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of the drug .
However , dialysis can remove both ethanol and propylene glycol in the case of overdose with ritonavir oral solution .
A Certified Poison Control Center should be consulted for up - to - date information on the management of overdose with ritonavir .
11 DESCRIPTION Ritonavir is an inhibitor of HIV protease with activity against the Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) .
Ritonavir is chemically designated as 2 , 4 , 7 , 12 - Tetraazatridecan - 13 - oic acid , 10 - hydroxy - 2 - methyl - 5 - ( 1 - methylethyl ) - 1 - [ 2 - ( 1 - methylethyl ) - 4 - thiazolyl ] - 3 , 6 - dioxo - 8 , 11 - bis ( phenylmethyl ) - 5 - thiazolylmethyl ester , [ 5 S - ( 5 R * , 8 R * , 10 R * , 11 R * ) ] .
Its molecular formula is C37H48N6O5S2 , and its molecular weight is 720 . 94 .
Ritonavir has the following structural formula : • [ MULTIMEDIA ] Ritonavir USP is a white to almost white powder .
It is freely soluble in methanol and in methylene chloride , very slightly soluble in acetonitrile , practically insoluble in water .
Ritonavir Tablets USP are available for oral administration containing 100 mg ritonavir USP and the following inactive ingredients : anhydrous dibasic calcium phosphate , colloidal silicon dioxide , copovidone , hypromellose , isopropyl alcohol , polysorbate 80 , polyethylene glycol , purified water , sodium stearyl fumarate , sorbitan monolaurate , and titanium dioxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Ritonavir is an antiretroviral drug [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology : QTcF interval was evaluated in a randomized , placebo and active ( moxifloxacin 400 mg once - daily ) controlled crossover study in 45 healthy adults , with 10 measurements over 12 hours on Day 3 .
The maximum mean ( 95 % upper confidence bound ) time - matched difference in QTcF from placebo after baseline correction was 5 . 5 ( 7 . 6 ) milliseconds ( msec ) for 400 mg twice - daily ritonavir .
Ritonavir 400 mg twice daily resulted in Day 3 ritonavir exposure that was approximately 1 . 5 fold higher than observed with ritonavir 600 mg twice - daily dose at steady state .
PR interval prolongation was also noted in subjects receiving ritonavir in the same study on Day 3 .
The maximum mean ( 95 % confidence interval ) difference from placebo in the PR interval after baseline correction was 22 ( 25 ) msec for 400 mg twice - daily ritonavir [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of ritonavir have been studied in healthy volunteers and HIV - infected patients ( CD4 greater than or equal to 50 cells per µL ) .
See Table 5 for ritonavir pharmacokinetic characteristics .
Absorption : The absolute bioavailability of ritonavir has not been determined .
After a 600 mg dose of oral solution , peak concentrations of ritonavir were achieved approximately 2 hours and 4 hours after dosing under fasting and non - fasting ( 514 KCal ; 9 % fat , 12 % protein , and 79 % carbohydrate ) conditions , respectively .
Ritonavir tablets are not bioequivalent to ritonavir capsules .
Under moderate fat conditions ( 857 kcal ; 31 % fat , 13 % protein , 56 % carbohydrates ) , when a single 100 mg ritonavir dose was administered as a tablet compared with a capsule , AUC ( 0 - ∞ ) met equivalence criteria but mean Cmax was increased by 26 % ( 92 . 8 % confidence intervals : ↑ 15 to ↑ 39 % ) .
No information is available comparing ritonavir tablets to ritonavir capsules under fasting conditions .
After administration of a single 100 mg dose under fed conditions ( 617 Kcal , 29 % calories from fat ) , ritonavir oral powder demonstrated comparable bioavailability to the oral solution .
Effect of Food on Oral Absorption : The bioavailability of ritonavir tablet , oral solution , and oral powder is decreased under fed conditions as compared to fasted conditions .
Following the administration of a 100 mg tablet dose of ritonavir , Cmax and AUCinf of ritonavir were decreased by 21 to 23 % under moderate fat ( 857 Kcal , 30 % from fat ) or high fat conditions ( 917 Kcal , 60 % calories from fat ) relative to fasting conditions .
Following the administration of a 600 mg dose ritonavir oral solution , Cmax and AUCinf of ritonavir were decreased by 23 % and 7 % , respectively , under nonfasting conditions ( 514 Kcal , 10 % from fat ) relative to fasting conditions .
Dilution of the oral solution , within one hour of administration , with 240 mL of chocolate milk , Advera ® or Ensure ® did not significantly affect the extent and rate of ritonavir absorption .
Following the administration of a 100 mg dose of ritonavir oral powder , Cmax and AUCinf of ritonavir were decreased by 23 to 49 % under moderate fat ( 617 Kcal , 29 % calories from fat ) or high fat conditions ( 917 Kcal , 60 % calories from fat ) relative to fasting conditions .
Metabolism : Nearly all of the plasma radioactivity after a single oral 600 mg dose of 14 C - ritonavir oral solution ( n = 5 ) was attributed to unchanged ritonavir .
Five ritonavir metabolites have been identified in human urine and feces .
The isopropylthiazole oxidation metabolite ( M - 2 ) is the major metabolite and has antiviral activity similar to that of parent drug ; however , the concentrations of this metabolite in plasma are low .
In vitro studies utilizing human liver microsomes have demonstrated that cytochrome P450 3 A ( CYP3A ) is the major isoform involved in ritonavir metabolism , although CYP2D6 also contributes to the formation of M – 2 .
Elimination : In a study of five subjects receiving a 600 mg dose of 14 C - ritonavir oral solution , 11 . 3 ± 2 . 8 % of the dose was excreted into the urine , with 3 . 5 ± 1 . 8 % of the dose excreted as unchanged parent drug .
In that study , 86 . 4 ± 2 . 9 % of the dose was excreted in the feces with 33 . 8 ± 10 . 8 % of the dose excreted as unchanged parent drug .
Upon multiple dosing , ritonavir accumulation is less than predicted from a single dose possibly due to a time and dose - related increase in clearance .

Special Populations : Gender , Race and Age : No age - related pharmacokinetic differences have been observed in adult patients ( 18 to 63 years ) .
Ritonavir pharmacokinetics have not been studied in older patients .
A study of ritonavir pharmacokinetics in healthy males and females showed no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of ritonavir .
Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been identified .
Pediatric Patients : Steady - state pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 37 HIV - infected patients ages 2 to 14 years receiving doses ranging from 250 mg per m2 twice - daily to 400 mg per m2 twice - daily in PACTG Study 310 , and in 41 HIV - infected patients ages 1 month to 2 years at doses of 350 and 450 mg per m2 twice - daily in PACTG Study 345 .
Across dose groups , ritonavir steady - state oral clearance ( CL / F / m2 ) was approximately 1 . 5 to 1 . 7 times faster in pediatric patients than in adult subjects .
Ritonavir concentrations obtained after 350 to 400 mg per m2 twice - daily in pediatric patients greater than 2 years were comparable to those obtained in adults receiving 600 mg ( approximately 330 mg per m2 ) twice - daily .
The following observations were seen regarding ritonavir concentrations after administration with 350 or 450 mg per m2 twice - daily in children less than 2 years of age .
Higher ritonavir exposures were not evident with 450 mg per m2 twice - daily compared to the 350 mg per m2 twice - daily .
Ritonavir trough concentrations were somewhat lower than those obtained in adults receiving 600 mg twice - daily .
The area under the ritonavir plasma concentration time curve and trough concentrations obtained after administration with 350 or 450 mg per m2 twice - daily in children less than 2 years were approximately 16 % and 60 % lower , respectively , than that obtained in adults receiving 600 mg twice daily .
Renal Impairment : Ritonavir pharmacokinetics have not been studied in patients with renal impairment , however , since renal clearance is negligible , a decrease in total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment .
Hepatic Impairment : Dose - normalized steady - state ritonavir concentrations in subjects with mild hepatic impairment ( 400 mg twice - daily , n = 6 ) were similar to those in control subjects dosed with 500 mg twice - daily .
Dose - normalized steady - state ritonavir exposures in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment ( 400 mg twice - daily , n = 6 ) were about 40 % lower than those in subjects with normal hepatic function ( 500 mg twice - daily , n = 6 ) .
Protein binding of ritonavir was not statistically significantly affected by mild or moderately impaired hepatic function .
No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment .
However , health care providers should be aware of the potential for lower ritonavir concentrations in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and should monitor patient response carefully .
Ritonavir has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
Pregnancy : Based on evaluation of the published literature , ritonavir exposures are reduced during pregnancy relative to postpartum .

↑ Indicates increase , ↓ indicates decrease , ↔ indicates no change . ND = not determined 12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action : Ritonavir is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of the HIV - 1 protease .
Inhibition of HIV protease renders the enzyme incapable of processing the Gag - Pol polyprotein precursor which leads to production of non - infectious immature HIV particles .
Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture : The activity of ritonavir was assessed in acutely infected lymphoblastoid cell lines and in peripheral blood lymphocytes .
The concentration of drug that inhibits 50 % ( EC50 ) value of viral replication ranged from 3 . 8 to 153 nM depending upon the HIV - 1 isolate and the cells employed .
The average EC50 value for low passage clinical isolates was 22 nM ( n = 13 ) .
In MT4 cells , ritonavir demonstrated additive effects against HIV - 1 in combination with either didanosine ( ddI ) or zidovudine ( ZDV ) .
Studies which measured cytotoxicity of ritonavir on several cell lines showed that greater than 20 microM was required to inhibit cellular growth by 50 % resulting in a cell culture therapeutic index of at least 1 , 000 .
Resistance : HIV - 1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to ritonavir have been selected in cell culture .
Genotypic analysis of these isolates showed mutations in the HIV - 1 protease gene leading to amino acid substitutions I84V , V82F , A71V , and M46I .
Phenotypic ( n = 18 ) and genotypic ( n = 48 ) changes in HIV - 1 isolates from selected patients treated with ritonavir were monitored in phase I / II trials over a period of 3 to 32 weeks .
Substitutions associated with the HIV – 1 viral protease in isolates obtained from 43 patients appeared to occur in a stepwise and ordered fashion at positions V82A / F / T / S , I54V , A71V / T , and I36L , followed by combinations of substitutions at an additional 5 specific amino acid positions ( M46I / L , K20R , I84V , L33F and L90M ) .
Of 18 patients for whom both phenotypic and genotypic analysis were performed on free virus isolated from plasma , 12 showed reduced susceptibility to ritonavir in cell culture .
All 18 patients possessed one or more substitutions in the viral protease gene .
The V82A / F substitution appeared to be necessary but not sufficient to confer phenotypic resistance .
Phenotypic resistance was defined as a greater than or equal to 5 - fold decrease in viral sensitivity in cell culture from baseline .
Cross - Resistance to Other Antiretrovirals : Among protease inhibitors variable cross - resistance has been recognized .
Serial HIV - 1 isolates obtained from six patients during ritonavir therapy showed a decrease in ritonavir susceptibility in cell culture but did not demonstrate a concordant decrease in susceptibility to saquinavir in cell culture when compared to matched baseline isolates .
However , isolates from two of these patients demonstrated decreased susceptibility to indinavir in cell culture ( 8 - fold ) .
Isolates from 5 patients were also tested for cross - resistance to amprenavir and nelfinavir ; isolates from 3 patients had a decrease in susceptibility to nelfinavir ( 6 - to 14 - fold ) , and none to amprenavir .
Cross - resistance between ritonavir and reverse transcriptase inhibitors is unlikely because of the different enzyme targets involved .
One ZDV - resistant HIV - 1 isolate tested in cell culture retained full susceptibility to ritonavir .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis : Carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats have been carried out on ritonavir .
In male mice , at levels of 50 , 100 or 200 mg per kg per day , there was a dose dependent increase in the incidence of both adenomas and combined adenomas and carcinomas in the liver .
Based on AUC measurements , the exposure at the high dose was approximately 0 . 3 - fold for males that of the exposure in humans with the recommended therapeutic dose ( 600 mg twice - daily ) .
There were no carcinogenic effects seen in females at the dosages tested .
The exposure at the high dose was approximately 0 . 6 - fold for the females that of the exposure in humans .
In rats dosed at levels of 7 , 15 or 30 mg per kg per day there were no carcinogenic effects .
In this study , the exposure at the high dose was approximately 6 % that of the exposure in humans with the recommended therapeutic dose .
Based on the exposures achieved in the animal studies , the significance of the observed effects is not known .
Mutagenesis : However , ritonavir was found to be negative for mutagenic or clastogenic activity in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay using S . typhimurium and E . coli , the mouse lymphoma assay , the mouse micronucleus test and chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes .
Impairment of Fertility : Ritonavir produced no effects on fertility in rats at drug exposures approximately 40 % ( male ) and 60 % ( female ) of that achieved with the proposed therapeutic dose .
Higher dosages were not feasible due to hepatic toxicity .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The activity of ritonavir as monotherapy or in combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors has been evaluated in 1 , 446 patients enrolled in two double - blind , randomized trials .
14 . 1 Advanced Patients with Prior Antiretroviral Therapy Study 247 was a randomized , double - blind trial ( with open - label follow - up ) conducted in HIV - infected patients with at least nine months of prior antiretroviral therapy and baseline CD4 cell counts less than or equal to 100 cells per µL .
Ritonavir 600 mg twice - daily or placebo was added to each patient ' s baseline antiretroviral therapy regimen , which could have consisted of up to two approved antiretroviral agents .
The study accrued 1 , 090 patients , with mean baseline CD4 cell count at study entry of 32 cells per µL .
After the clinical benefit of ritonavir therapy was demonstrated , all patients were eligible to switch to open - label ritonavir for the duration of the follow - up period .
Median duration of double - blind therapy with ritonavir and placebo was 6 months .
The median duration of follow - up through the end of the open - label phase was 13 . 5 months for patients randomized to ritonavir and 14 months for patients randomized to placebo .
The cumulative incidence of clinical disease progression or death during the double - blind phase of Study 247 was 26 % for patients initially randomized to ritonavir compared to 42 % for patients initially randomized to placebo .
This difference in rates was statistically significant .
Cumulative mortality through the end of the open - label follow - up phase for patients enrolled in Study 247 was 18 % ( 99 / 543 ) for patients initially randomized to ritonavir compared to 26 % ( 142 / 547 ) for patients initially randomized to placebo .
This difference in rates was statistically significant .
However , since the analysis at the end of the open - label phase includes patients in the placebo arm who were switched from placebo to ritonavir therapy , the survival benefit of ritonavir cannot be precisely estimated .
During the double - blind phase of Study 247 , CD4 cell counts increases from baseline for patients randomized to ritonavir at Week 2 and Week 4 were observed .
From Week 4 and through Week 24 , mean CD4 cell counts for patients randomized to ritonavir appeared to plateau .
In contrast , there was no apparent change in mean CD4 cell counts for patients randomized to placebo at any visit between baseline and Week 24 of the double - blind phase of Study 247 .
14 . 2 Patients without Prior Antiretroviral Therapy In Study 245 , 356 antiretroviral - naive HIV - infected patients ( mean baseline CD4 = 364 cells per µL ) were randomized to receive either ritonavir 600 mg twice - daily , zidovudine 200 mg three - times - daily , or a combination of these drugs .
During the double - blind phase of study 245 , greater mean CD4 cell count increases were observed from baseline to Week 12 in the ritonavir - containing arms compared to the zidovudine arms .
Mean CD4 cell count changes subsequently appeared to plateau through Week 24 in the ritonavir arm , whereas mean CD4 cell counts gradually diminished through Week 24 in the zidovudine and ritonavir plus zidovudine arms .
Greater mean reductions in plasma HIV - 1 RNA levels were observed from baseline to Week 2 for the ritonavir - containing arms compared to the zidovudine arm .
After Week 2 and through Week 24 , mean plasma HIV - 1 RNA levels either remained stable in the ritonavir and zidovudine arms or gradually rebounded toward baseline in the ritonavir plus zidovudine arm .
