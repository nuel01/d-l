Infants and young children are especially susceptible to the toxic effects of anticholinergics .
Close supervision is recommended for infants and children with spastic paralysis or brain damage since an increased response to anticholinergics has been reported in these patients and dosage adjustments are often required .
When anticholinergics are given to children where the environmental temperature is high , there is a risk of a rapid increase in body temperature because of these medications ’ suppression of sweat gland activity .
A paradoxical reaction characterized by hyperexcitability may occur in children taking large doses of anticholinergics .

Caution is also recommended when anticholinergics are given to geriatric patients , because of the danger of precipitating undiagnosed glaucoma .
Memory may become severely impaired in geriatric patients , especially those who already have memory problems , with the continued use of anticholinergics since these drugs block the actions of acetylcholine , which is responsible for many functions of the brain , including memory functions .
