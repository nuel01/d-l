( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Immune reconstitution syndrome : May necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
( 5 . 2 ) • Lactic acidosis / severe hepatomegaly with steatosis : Discontinue treatment in patients who develop symptoms or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients Coinfected with HIV - 1 and HBV All patients should be tested for the presence of chronic Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) before or when initiating emtricitabine [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B ( e . g . , liver decompensation and liver failure ) have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV - 1 and HBV and have discontinued emtricitabine .
Patients who are coinfected with HIV - 1 and HBV who discontinue emtricitabine should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow - up for at least several months after stopping treatment .
If appropriate , initiation of anti - hepatitis B therapy may be warranted , especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis , since posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure .
5 . 2 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy , including emtricitabine .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [ PCP ] , or tuberculosis ) , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
Autoimmune disorders ( such as Graves ' disease , polymyositis , and Guillain - Barre syndrome ) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution ; however , the time to onset is more variable , and can occur many months after initiation of treatment .
5 . 3 Lactic Acidosis / Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis , including fatal cases , have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs , including FTC , alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals .
Treatment with emtricitabine should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity ( which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations ) .
5 . 4 Dose Adjustment in Patients with New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Emtricitabine is principally eliminated by the kidney .
Reduction of the dosage of emtricitabine is recommended for patients with impaired renal function [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials Experience in Adults More than 2 , 000 adult subjects with HIV - 1 infection have been treated with emtricitabine alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents for periods of 10 days to 200 weeks in clinical trials .
The most common adverse reactions ( incidence greater than or equal to 10 % , any severity ) identified from any of the three large , controlled clinical trials include headache , diarrhea , nausea , fatigue , dizziness , depression , insomnia , abnormal dreams , rash , abdominal pain , asthenia , increased cough , and rhinitis .
In Trials 301 A and 303 , the most common adverse reactions that occurred in subjects receiving emtricitabine with other antiretroviral agents were headache , diarrhea , nausea , and rash , which were generally mild to moderate .
Approximately 1 % of subjects discontinued participation in the clinical trials due to these events .
All adverse reactions were reported with similar frequency in emtricitabine and control treatment groups except for skin discoloration , which was reported with higher frequency in the emtricitabine treated group .
Skin discoloration , manifested by hyperpigmentation on the palms or soles , was generally mild and asymptomatic .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The potential for drug interactions with emtricitabine has been studied in combination with AZT , indinavir , d4T , famciclovir , and tenofovir DF ( TDF ) .
There were no clinically significant drug interactions for any of these drugs .
Drug interactions trials are described elsewhere in the labeling [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Breastfeeding is not recommended .
( 8 . 2 ) • Pediatrics : Dose adjustment based on age and weight .
( 2 . 5 , 12 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to emtricitabine during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry ( APR ) at 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
Risk Summary Available data from the APR show no increase in the overall risk of major birth defects with first trimester exposure for emtricitabine ( FTC ) ( 2 . 3 % ) compared with the background rate for major birth defects of 2 . 7 % in a U . S . reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program ( MACDP ) ( see Data ) .
The rate of miscarriage for individual drugs is not reported in the APR .
In the U . S . , general population , the estimated background risk of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 15 – 20 % .
In animal reproduction studies , no adverse developmental effects were observed when FTC was administered at exposures ≥ 60 times that of the recommended daily dose of emtricitabine ( see Data ) .
Data Human Data Based on prospective reports to the APR of exposures to FTC - containing regimens during pregnancy resulting in live births ( including over 2 , 700 exposed in the first trimester and over 1 , 200 exposed in the second / third trimester ) , there was no increase between FTC and overall birth defects compared with the background birth defect rate of 2 . 7 % in a U . S . reference population of the MACDP .
The prevalence of birth defects in live births was 2 . 4 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 9 % to 3 . 1 % ) with first trimester exposure to FTC - containing regimens and 2 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 5 % to 3 . 3 % ) with the second / third trimester exposure to FTC - containing regimens .
Prospective reports from the APR of overall major birth defects in pregnancies exposed to FTC are compared with a U . S . background major birth defect rate .
Methodologic limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group .
Limitations of using an external comparator include differences in methodology and populations , as well as confounding due to the underlying disease .
Additionally , published observational studies on FTC exposure in pregnancy have not shown an increased risk for major malformations .
Animal Data FTC was administered orally to pregnant mice ( at 0 , 250 , 500 , or 1 , 000 mg / kg / day ) , and rabbits ( at 0 , 100 , 300 , or 1 , 000 mg / kg / day ) through organogenesis ( on gestation days 6 through 15 , and 7 through 19 , respectively ) .
No significant toxicological effects were observed in embryo - fetal toxicity studies performed with FTC in mice at exposures ( AUC ) approximately 60 times higher and in rabbits at approximately 120 times higher than human exposures at the recommended daily dose .
In a pre / postnatal development study in mice , FTC was administered orally at doses up to 1 , 000 mg / kg / day ; no significant adverse effects directly related to drug were observed in the offspring exposed daily from before birth ( in utero ) through sexual maturity at daily exposures ( AUC ) of approximately 60 times higher than human exposures at the recommended daily dose .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV - 1 infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV - 1 .
Based on published data , FTC has been shown to be present in human breast milk .
It is not known if FTC affects milk production or has effects on the breastfed child .
Because of the potential for : ( 1 ) HIV transmission ( in HIV - negative infants ) ; ( 2 ) developing viral resistance ( in HIV - positive infants ) ; and ( 3 ) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant similar to those seen in adults , instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are taking emtricitabine .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of FTC in patients between 3 months and 21 years of age is supported by data from three open - label , nonrandomized clinical trials in which FTC was administered to 169 HIV - 1 infected treatment - naive and experienced ( defined as virologically suppressed on a 3 TC containing regimen for which FTC was substituted for 3 TC ) subjects [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
The pharmacokinetics of FTC were studied in 20 neonates born to HIV - 1 positive mothers [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
All neonates were HIV - 1 negative at the end of the trial ; the efficacy of FTC in preventing or treating HIV - 1 could not be determined .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of emtricitabine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , dose selection for the elderly patient should be cautious , keeping in mind the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Modify the dose or dosing interval for emtricitabine in patients with creatinine clearance below 50 mL / min or in patients with end stage renal disease requiring dialysis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE If overdose occurs , the patient should be monitored for evidence of toxicity , and standard supportive treatment applied as necessary .
Hemodialysis treatment removes approximately 30 % of the FTC dose over a 3 - hour dialysis period starting within 1 . 5 hours of FTC dosing ( blood flow rate of 400 mL / min and a dialysate flow rate of 600 mL / min ) .
It is not known whether FTC can be removed by peritoneal dialysis .
11 DESCRIPTION Emtricitabine is a synthetic nucleoside analog with activity against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) reverse transcriptase .
The chemical name of emtricitabine is 5 - fluoro - 1 - ( 2 R , 5 S ) - [ 2 - ( hydroxymethyl ) - 1 , 3 - oxathiolan - 5 - yl ] cytosine .
Emtricitabine is the ( - ) enantiomer of a thio analog of cytidine , which differs from other cytidine analogs in that it has a fluorine in the 5 - position .
It has a molecular formula of C 8 H 10 FN 3 O 3 S and a molecular weight of 247 . 24 .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Emtricitabine is a white to off - white powder with a solubility of approximately 112 mg / mL in water at 25 ºC .
The log P for FTC is - 0 . 43 and the pKa is 2 . 65 .
Emtricitabine capsules are for oral administration .
Each capsule contains 200 mg of emtricitabine and the inactive ingredients , mannitol , hypromellose , and magnesium stearate .
The capsule shell contains the following inactive ingredients and dyes : FD & C blue 1 , titanium dioxide , gelatin , and sodium lauryl sulfate .
The capsules are printed with ink containing black iron oxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Emtricitabine is an antiretroviral drug [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Adults The pharmacokinetic properties of FTC were evaluated in healthy subjects and HIV - 1 - infected subjects .
Emtricitabine pharmacokinetics are similar between these populations .
Figure 1 shows the mean steady - state plasma FTC concentration - time profile in 20 HIV - 1 - infected subjects receiving emtricitabine capsules .
Figure 1 Mean ( ± 95 % CI ) Steady - State Plasma FTC Concentrations in HIV - 1 - Infected Adults ( N = 20 ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] Absorption Emtricitabine is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration , with peak plasma concentrations occurring at 1 - 2 hours postdose .
Following multiple dose oral administration of emtricitabine capsules to 20 HIV - 1 infected subjects , the ( mean ± SD ) steady - state plasma FTC peak concentration ( C max ) was 1 . 8 ± 0 . 7 µg / mL and the area - under the plasma concentration - time curve over a 24 - hour dosing interval ( AUC ) was 10 . 0 ± 3 . 1 µg • hr / mL .
The mean steady - state plasma trough concentration at 24 hours postdose was 0 . 09 µg / mL .
The mean absolute bioavailability of emtricitabine capsules was 93 % , while the mean absolute bioavailability of emtricitabine oral solution was 75 % .
The relative bioavailability of emtricitabine oral solution was approximately 80 % of emtricitabine capsules .
The multiple dose pharmacokinetics of FTC are dose proportional over a dose range of 25 - 200 mg .
Distribution In vitro binding of FTC to human plasma proteins was less than 4 % and independent of concentration over the range of 0 . 02 - 200 µg / mL .
At peak plasma concentration , the mean plasma to blood drug concentration ratio was ~ 1 . 0 and the mean semen to plasma drug concentration ratio was ~ 4 . 0 .
Metabolism Following administration of radiolabelled FTC , complete recovery of the dose was achieved in urine ( ~ 86 % ) and feces ( ~ 14 % ) .
Thirteen percent ( 13 % ) of the dose was recovered in urine as three putative metabolites .
The biotransformation of FTC includes oxidation of the thiol moiety to form the 3 ' - sulfoxide diastereomers ( ~ 9 % of dose ) and conjugation with glucuronic acid to form 2 ' - O - glucuronide ( ~ 4 % of dose ) .
No other metabolites were identifiable .
Elimination The plasma FTC half - life is approximately 10 hours .
The renal clearance of FTC is greater than the estimated creatinine clearance , suggesting elimination by both glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion .
There may be competition for elimination with other compounds that are also renally eliminated .
Effects of Food on Oral Absorption Emtricitabine capsules may be taken with or without food .
Emtricitabine systemic exposure ( AUC ) was unaffected while C max decreased by 29 % when emtricitabine capsules were administered with food ( an approximately 1000 kcal high - fat meal ) .
Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of FTC have not been fully evaluated in the elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) .
Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of FTC at steady state were determined in 77 HIV - 1 infected pediatric subjects , and the pharmacokinetic profile was characterized in four age groups ( Table 6 ) .
The FTC exposure achieved in pediatric subjects receiving a daily dose of 6 mg / kg up to a maximum of 240 mg oral solution or a 200 mg capsule is similar to exposures achieved in adult subjects receiving a once - daily dose of 200 mg .

Assessment of Drug Interactions At concentrations up to 14 - fold higher than those observed in vivo , FTC did not inhibit in vitro drug metabolism mediated by any of the following human CYP isoforms : CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , and CYP3A4 .
FTC did not inhibit the enzyme responsible for glucuronidation ( uridine - 5 ' - disphosphoglucuronyl transferase ) .
Based on the results of these in vitro experiments and the known elimination pathways of FTC , the potential for CYP - mediated interactions involving FTC with other medicinal products is low .
Emtricitabine has been evaluated in healthy volunteers in combination with TDF , AZT , indinavir , famciclovir , and d4T .

FTC - TP is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases α , β , ε , and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ .
Antiviral Activity The antiviral activity of FTC against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV - 1 was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines , the MAGI - CCR5 cell line , and peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
The 50 % effective concentration ( EC 50 ) values for FTC were in the range of 0 . 0013 - 0 . 64 μM ( 0 . 0003 - 0 . 158 µg / mL ) .
The median EC 50 , range , and number of isolates for the laboratory isolates were 0 . 07 , 0 . 009 − 0 . 62 , 10 ; 0 . 011 , 0 . 002 − 0 . 03 , 12 ; 0 . 055 , 0 . 0015 − 0 . 09 , 4 respectively for lymphoblastoid , PBMC , and reporter cells .
The median EC 50 , range , and number of isolates for the clinical isolates were 0 . 05 , 0 . 0105 − 0 . 64 , 15 ; 0 . 015 , 0 . 004 − 0 . 028 , 6 respectively for lymphoblastoid cells and PBMCs .
No antagonism was observed in drug combination studies of emtricitabine with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) ( abacavir , lamivudine , stavudine , tenofovir , zidovudine ) , non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NNRTIs ) ( delavirdine , efavirenz , nevirapine ) , and protease inhibitors ( amprenavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , saquinavir ) .
FTC displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV - 1 clades A , B , C , D , E , F , and G ( EC 50 values ranged from 0 . 007 - 0 . 075 μM ) and showed strain - specific activity against HIV - 2 ( EC 50 values ranged from 0 . 007 - 1 . 5 μM in PBMCs and MAGI cells ) .
Resistance FTC - resistant isolates of HIV - 1 have been selected in cell culture and in vivo .
Genotypic analysis of these isolates showed that the reduced susceptibility to FTC was associated with a valine or isoleucine ( M184V / I ) substitution in the HIV - 1 RT .
FTC - resistant isolates of HIV - 1 have been recovered from some subjects treated with FTC alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents .
In a clinical trial of treatment - naive subjects treated with emtricitabine , didanosine , and efavirenz ( EFV ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] , viral isolates from 37 . 5 % of subjects with virologic failure showed reduced susceptibility to FTC .
Genotypic analysis of these isolates showed that the resistance was due to M184V / I substitutions in the HIV - 1 RT .
In a clinical trial of treatment - naive subjects treated with either emtricitabine , TDF , and EFV or AZT / 3 TC and EFV [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] , resistance analysis was performed on HIV - 1 isolates from all confirmed virologic failure subjects with greater than 400 copies / mL of HIV - 1 RNA at Week 144 or early discontinuation .
Development of EFV resistance - associated substitutions occurred most frequently and was similar between the treatment arms .
The M184V amino acid substitution , associated with resistance to emtricitabine and 3 TC , was observed in 2 / 19 analyzed subject isolates in the emtricitabine + TDF group and in 10 / 29 analyzed subject isolates in the AZT / 3 TC group .
Through 144 weeks of Trial 934 , no subjects have developed a detectable K65R substitution in their HIV - 1 as analyzed through standard genotypic analysis .
Cross Resistance Cross - resistance among certain NRTIs has been recognized .
FTC - resistant isolates ( M184V / I ) were cross - resistant to 3 TC but retained susceptibility in cell culture to AZT , didanosine , d4T , and tenofovir , and to NNRTIs ( delavirdine , EFV , and nevirapine ) .
HIV - 1 isolates containing the K65R substitution , selected in vivo by abacavir , didanosine , and tenofovir , demonstrated reduced susceptibility to inhibition by FTC .
Viruses harboring substitutions conferring reduced susceptibility to AZT and d4T ( M41L , D67N , K70R , L210W , T215Y / F , K219Q / E ) or didanosine ( L74V ) remained sensitive to FTC .
HIV - 1 containing the K103N substitution associated with resistance to NNRTIs was susceptible to FTC .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In long - term oral carcinogenicity studies of FTC , no drug - related increases in tumor incidence were found in mice at doses up to 750 mg / kg / day ( 26 times the human systemic exposure at the therapeutic dose of 200 mg / day ) or in rats at doses up to 600 mg / kg / day ( 31 times the human systemic exposure at the therapeutic dose ) .
Emtricitabine was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial test ( Ames test ) or mouse lymphoma or mouse micronucleus assays .
Emtricitabine did not affect fertility in male rats at approximately 140 - fold or in male and female mice at approximately 60 - fold higher exposures ( AUC ) than in humans given the recommended 200 mg daily dose .
Fertility was normal in the offspring of mice exposed daily from before birth ( in utero ) through sexual maturity at daily exposures ( AUC ) of approximately 60 - fold higher than human exposures at the recommended 200 mg daily dose .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Overview of Clinical Trials The efficacy and safety of emtricitabine were evaluated in the trials summarized in Table 10 .
14 . 2 Clinical Trial Results in Treatment - Naive Adults Trial 934 Data through 144 weeks are reported for Trial 934 , a randomized , open - label , active - controlled multicenter clinical trial comparing Emtricitabine + TDF administered in combination with EFV versus AZT / 3 TC fixed - dose combination administered in combination with EFV in 511 antiretroviral - naive subjects .
From Weeks 96 to 144 of the trial , subjects received FTC / TDF fixed - dose combination with EFV in place of emtricitabine + TDF with EFV .
Subjects had a mean age of 38 years ( range 18 - 80 ) ; 86 % were male , 59 % were Caucasian , and 23 % were Black .
The mean baseline CD4 + cell count was 245 cells / mm 3 ( range 2 - 1191 ) and median baseline plasma HIV - 1 RNA was 5 . 01 log 10 copies / mL ( range 3 . 56 - 6 . 54 ) .
Subjects were stratified by baseline CD4 + cell count ( < or ≥ 200 cells / mm 3 ) ; 41 % had CD4 + cell counts < 200 cells / mm 3 and 51 % of subjects had baseline viral loads > 100 , 000 copies / mL .
Table 11 provides treatment outcomes through 48 and 144 weeks for those subjects who did not have EFV resistance at baseline .
Table 11 Virologic Outcomes of Randomized Treatment at Week 48 and 144 ( Trial 934 ) a . Subjects who were responders at Week 48 or Week 96 ( HIV - 1 RNA < 400 copies / mL ) but did not consent to continue in the trial after Week 48 or Week 96 were excluded from analysis .
b . Subjects achieved and maintained confirmed HIV - 1 RNA < 400 copies / mL through Weeks 48 and 144 .
c . Includes confirmed viral rebound and failure to achieve confirmed < 400 copies / mL through Weeks 48 and 144 .
d . Includes lost to follow - up , subject withdrawal , noncompliance , protocol violation and other reasons .
Outcomes Week 48 Week 144 Emtricitabine + TDF + EFV ( N = 244 ) AZT / 3 TC + EFV ( N = 243 ) Emtricitabine + TDF + EFV ( N = 227 ) a AZT / 3 TC + EFV ( N = 229 ) a Responder b 84 % 73 % 71 % 58 % Virologic failure c 2 % 4 % 3 % 6 % Rebound 1 % 3 % 2 % 5 % Never suppressed 0 % 0 % 0 % 0 % Change in antiretroviral regimen 1 % 1 % 1 % 1 % Death < 1 % 1 % 1 % 1 % Discontinued due to adverse event 4 % 9 % 5 % 12 % Discontinued for other reasons d 10 % 14 % 20 % 22 % Through Week 48 , 84 % , and 73 % of subjects in the emtricitabine + TDF group and the AZT / 3 TC group , respectively , achieved and maintained HIV - 1 RNA < 400 copies / mL ( 71 % and 58 % through Week 144 ) .
The difference in the proportion of subjects who achieved and maintained HIV - 1 RNA < 400 copies / mL through 48 weeks largely results from the higher number of discontinuations due to adverse events and other reasons in the AZT / 3 TC group in this open - label trial .
In addition , 80 % and 70 % of subjects in the emtricitabine + TDF group and the AZT / 3 TC group , respectively , achieved and maintained HIV - 1 RNA < 50 copies / mL through Week 48 ( 64 % and 56 % through Week 144 ) .
The mean increase from baseline in CD4 + cell count was 190 cells / mm 3 in the emtricitabine + TDF group and 158 cells / mm 3 in the AZT / 3 TC group at Week 48 ( 312 and 271 cells / mm 3 at Week 144 ) .
Through 48 weeks , 7 subjects in the emtricitabine + TDF group and 5 subjects in the AZT / 3 TC group experienced a new CDC Class C event ( 10 and 6 subjects through 144 weeks ) .
Trial 301 A Trial 301 A was a 48 - week double - blind , active - controlled , multicenter clinical trial comparing emtricitabine ( 200 mg once daily ) administered in combination with didanosine and EFV versus d4T , didanosine , and EFV in 571 antiretroviral naïve adult subjects .
Subjects had a mean age of 36 years ( range 18 - 69 ) ; 85 % were male , 52 % Caucasian , 16 % African - American , and 26 % Hispanic .
Subjects had a mean baseline CD4 + cell count of 318 cells / mm 3 ( range 5 - 1317 ) and a median baseline plasma HIV - 1 RNA of 4 . 9 log 10 copies / mL ( range 2 . 6 - 7 . 0 ) .
Thirty - eight percent of subjects had baseline viral loads > 100 , 000 copies / mL and 31 % had CD4 + cell counts < 200 cells / mL .
Table 12 provides treatment outcomes through 48 weeks .

14 . 3 Clinical Trial Results in Treatment - Experienced Adults Trial 303 Trial 303 was a 48 - week , open - label , active - controlled , multicenter clinical trial comparing emtricitabine ( 200 mg once daily ) to 3 TC , in combination with d4T or AZT and a protease inhibitor or NNRTI in 440 adult subjects who were on a 3 TC - containing triple - antiretroviral drug regimen for at least 12 weeks prior to trial entry and had HIV - 1 RNA ≤ 400 copies / mL .
Subjects were randomized 1 : 2 to continue therapy with 3 TC ( 150 mg twice daily ) or to switch to emtricitabine ( 200 mg once daily ) .
All subjects were maintained on their stable background regimen .
Subjects had a mean age of 42 years ( range 22 - 80 ) ; 86 % were male , 64 % Caucasian , 21 % African - American , and 13 % Hispanic .
Subjects had a mean baseline CD4 + cell count of 527 cells / mm 3 ( range 37 - 1909 ) , and a median baseline plasma HIV - 1 RNA of 1 . 7 log 10 copies / mL ( range 1 . 7 - 4 . 0 ) .

Through 48 weeks , in the emtricitabine group 2 subjects ( 0 . 7 % ) experienced a new CDC Class C event compared to 2 subjects ( 1 . 4 % ) in the 3 TC group .
14 . 4 Clinical Trial Results in Pediatrics In three open - label , nonrandomized clinical trials , FTC was administered to 169 HIV - 1 infected treatment - naive and experienced ( defined as virologically suppressed on a 3 TC - containing regimen for which FTC was substituted for 3 TC ) subjects between 3 months and 21 years of age .
Subjects received once - daily emtricitabine oral solution ( 6 mg / kg to a maximum of 240 mg / day ) or emtricitabine capsules ( a single 200 mg capsule once daily ) in combination with at least two other antiretroviral agents .
Subjects had a mean age of 7 . 9 years ( range 0 . 3 - 21 ) ; 49 % were male , 15 % Caucasian , 61 % Black , and 24 % Hispanic .
Subjects had a median baseline HIV - 1 RNA of 4 . 6 log 10 copies / mL ( range 1 . 7 - 6 . 4 ) and a mean baseline CD4 + cell count of 745 cells / mm 3 ( range 2 - 2650 ) .
