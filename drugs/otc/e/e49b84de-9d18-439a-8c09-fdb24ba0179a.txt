EpiPen ® and EpiPen ® Jr Auto - Injectors do not contain latex .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Epinephrine is the drug of choice for the emergency treatment of severe allergic reactions ( Type I ) to insect stings or bites , foods , drugs , and other allergens .
It can also be used in the treatment of anaphylaxis of unknown cause ( idiopathic anaphylaxis ) or exercise - induced anaphylaxis .
When given intramuscularly or subcutaneously it has a rapid onset and short duration of action .
Epinephrine acts on both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors .
Through its action on alpha adrenergic receptors , epinephrine lessens the vasodilation and increased vascular permeability that occurs during anaphylaxis , which can lead to loss of intravascular fluid volume and hypotension .
Through its action on beta - adrenergic receptors , epinephrine causes bronchial smooth muscle relaxation that helps alleviate bronchospasm , wheezing and dyspnea that may occur during anaphylaxis .
Epinephrine also alleviates pruritus , urticaria , and angioedema and may be effective in relieving gastrointestinal and genitourinary symptoms associated with anaphylaxis because of its relaxer effects on the smooth muscle of the stomach , intestine , uterus , and urinary bladder .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE EpiPen ® and EpiPen ® Jr Auto - Injectors are indicated in the emergency treatment of allergic reactions ( Type I ) including anaphylaxis to stinging insects ( e . g . , order Hymenoptera , which include bees , wasps , hornets , yellow jackets and fire ants ) and biting insects ( e . g . , triatoma , mosquitos ) , allergen immunotherapy , foods , drugs , diagnostic testing substances ( e . g . , radiocontrast media ) and other allergens , as well as idiopathic anaphylaxis or exercise - induced anaphylaxis .
EpiPen ® and EpiPen ® Jr Auto - Injectors are intended for immediate administration in patients , who are determined to be at increased risk for anaphylaxis , including individuals with a history of anaphylactic reactions .
Selection of the appropriate dosage strength is determined according to patient body weight ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section ) .
Such reactions may occur within minutes after exposure and consist of flushing , apprehension , syncope , tachycardia , thready or unobtainable pulse associated with a fall in blood pressure , convulsions , vomiting , diarrhea and abdominal cramps , involuntary voiding , wheezing , dyspnea due to laryngeal spasm , pruritus , rashes , urticaria or angioedema .
EpiPen ® and EpiPen ® Jr Auto - Injectors are intended for immediate self - administration as emergency supportive therapy only and are not a substitute for immediate medical care .
CONTRAINDICATIONS There are no absolute contraindications to the use of epinephrine in a life - threatening situation .
WARNINGS EpiPen ® and EpiPen ® Jr Auto - Injectors should only be injected into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh .
DO NOT INJECT INTO BUTTOCK .
Injection into the buttock may not provide effective treatment of anaphylaxis .
Advise the patient to go immediately to the nearest emergency room for further treatment of anaphylaxis .
Since epinephrine is a strong vasoconstrictor , accidental injection into the digits , hands or feet may result in loss of blood flow to the affected area .
Treatment should be directed at vasodilation in addition to further treatment of anaphylaxis ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
Advise the patient to go immediately to the nearest emergency room and to inform the healthcare provider in the emergency room of the location of the accidental injection .
DO NOT INJECT INTRAVENOUSLY .
Large doses or accidental intravenous injection of epinephrine may result in cerebral hemorrhage due to sharp rise in blood pressure .
Rapidly acting vasodilators can counteract the marked pressor effects of epinephrine if there is such inadvertent administration .
Epinephrine is the preferred treatment for serious allergic reactions or other emergency situations even though this product contains sodium metabisulfite , a sulfite that may , in other products , cause allergic - type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms or life - threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible persons .
The alternatives to using epinephrine in a life - threatening situation may not be satisfactory .
The presence of a sulfite in this product should not deter administration of the drug for treatment of serious allergic or other emergency situations even if the patient is sulfite - sensitive .
Epinephrine should be administered with caution in patients who have heart disease , including patients with cardiac arrhythmias , coronary artery or organic heart disease , or hypertension .
In such patients , or in patients who are on drugs that may sensitize the heart to arrhythmias , e . g . , digitalis , diuretics , or anti - arrhythmics , epinephrine may precipitate or aggravate angina pectoris as well as produce ventricular arrhythmias .
It should be recognized that the presence of these conditions is not a contraindication to epinephrine administration in an acute , life - threatening situation .
Epinephrine is light sensitive and should be stored in the carrier tube provided .
Store at 25 ° C ( 77 ° F ) ; excursions permitted to 15 ° C - 30 ° C ( 59 ° F - 86 ° F ) ( See USP Controlled Room Temperature ) .
Do not refrigerate .
Before using , check to make sure the solution in the auto - injector is not discolored .
Replace the auto - injector if the solution is discolored or contains a precipitate .
PRECAUTIONS ( 1 ) General EpiPen ® and EpiPen ® Jr Auto - Injectors are not intended as a substitute for immediate medical care .
In conjunction with the administration of epinephrine , the patient should seek immediate medical or hospital care .
More than two sequential doses of epinephrine should only be administered under direct medical supervision .
Epinephrine is essential for the treatment of anaphylaxis .
Patients with a history of severe allergic reactions ( anaphylaxis ) to insect stings or bites , foods , drugs , and other allergens as well as idiopathic and exercise - induced anaphylaxis should be carefully instructed about the circumstances under which epinephrine should be used .
It must be clearly determined that the patient is at risk of future anaphylaxis , since the following risks may be associated with epinephrine administration ( see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION ) .
Epinephrine should be used with caution in patients who have cardiac arrhythmias , coronary artery or organic heart disease , hypertension , or in patients who are on drugs that may sensitize the heart to arrhythmias , e . g . , digitalis , diuretics , quinidine , or other antiarrhythmics .
In such patients , epinephrine may precipitate or aggravate angina pectoris as well as produce ventricular arrhythmias .
The effects of epinephrine may be potentiated by tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors .
Some patients may be at greater risk of developing adverse reactions after epinephrine administration .
These include : hyperthyroid individuals , individuals with cardiovascular disease , hypertension , or diabetes , elderly individuals , pregnant women , pediatric patients under 30 kg ( 66 lbs . )
body weight using EpiPen ® Auto - Injector , and pediatric patients under 15 kg ( 33 lbs . )
body weight using EpiPen ® J r Auto - Injector .
Despite these concerns , epinephrine is essential for the treatment of anaphylaxis .
Therefore , patients with these conditions , and / or any other person who might be in a position to administer EpiPen ® or EpiPen ® Jr Auto - Injector to a patient experiencing anaphylaxis should be carefully instructed in regard to the circumstances under which epinephrine should be used .
( 2 ) Information for Patients Complete patient information , including dosage , direction for proper administration and precautions can be found inside each EpiPen ® / EpiPen ® Jr Auto - Injector carton .
Epinephrine may produce symptoms and signs that include an increase in heart rate , the sensation of a more forceful heartbeat , palpitations , sweating , nausea and vomiting , difficulty breathing , pallor , dizziness , weakness or shakiness , headache , apprehension , nervousness , or anxiety .
These symptoms and signs usually subside rapidly , especially with rest , quiet and recumbency .
Patients with hypertension or hyperthyroidism may develop more severe or persistent effects , and patients with coronary artery disease could experience angina .
Patients with diabetes may develop increased blood glucose levels following epinephrine administration .
Patients with Parkinson ' s disease may notice a temporary worsening of symptoms .
In case of accidental injection , the patient should be advised to immediately go to the emergency room for treatment .
Since the epinephrine in the EpiPen ® Auto - Injector is a strong vasoconstrictor when injected into the digits , hands or feet , treatment should be directed at vasodilation if there is such an inadvertent administration to these areas ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
( 3 ) Drug Interactions Patients who receive epinephrine while concomitantly taking cardiac glycosides or diuretics should be observed carefully for the development of cardiac arrhythmias .
The effects of epinephrine may be potentiated by tricyclic antidepressants , monoamine oxidase inhibitors , levothyroxine sodium , and certain antihistamines , notably chlorpheniramine , tripe - lennamine and diphenhydramine .
The cardiostimulating and bronchodilating effects of epinephrine are antagonized by beta - adrenergic blocking drugs , such as propranolol .
The vasoconstricting and hypertensive effects of epinephrine are antagonized by alpha - adrenergic blocking drugs , such as phentoloamine .
Ergot alkaloids may also reverse the pressor effects of epinephrine .
( 4 ) Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Epinephrine and other catecholamines have been shown to have mutagenic potential in vitro and to be an oxidative mutagen in a WP2 bacterial reverse mutation assay .
Epinephrine had a moderate degree of mutagenicity , and was positive in the DNA Repair test with B . subtilis ( REC ) assay , but was not mutagenic in the Salmonella bacterial reverse mutation assay .
Studies of epinephrine after repeated exposure in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential or the effect on fertility have not been conducted .
This should not prevent the use of epinephrine under the conditions noted under INDICATIONS AND USAGE .
( 5 ) Usage in Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C : There is no study on the acute effect of epinephrine on pregnancy .
Epinephrine has been shown to have developmental effects when administered subcutaneously in rabbits at a dose of 1 . 2 mg / kg daily for two to three days ( approximately 30 times the maximum recommended daily subcutaneous or intramuscular dose on a mg / m2 basis ) , in mice at a subcutaneous dose of 1 mg / kg daily for 10 days ( approximately 7 times the maximum daily subcutaneous or intramuscular dose on a mg / m2 basis ) and in hamsters at a subcutaneous dose of 0 . 5 mg / kg daily for 4 days ( approximately 5 times the maximum recommended daily subcutaneous or intramuscular dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
These effects were not seen in mice at a subcutaneous dose of 0 . 5 mg / kg daily for 10 days ( approximately 3 times the maximum recommended daily subcutaneous or intramuscular dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Although , there are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women , epinephrine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions to epinephrine include transient , moderate anxiety ; apprehensiveness ; restlessness ; tremor ; weakness ; dizziness ; sweating ; palpitations ; pallor ; nausea and vomiting ; headache ; and / or respiratory difficulties .
These symptoms occur in some persons receiving therapeutic doses of epinephrine , but are more likely to occur in patients with hypertension or hyperthyroidism .
Arrhythmias , including fatal ventricular fibrillation , have been reported in patients with underlying cardiac disease or certain drugs ( see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ) .
Rapid rises in blood pressure have produced cerebral hemorrhage , particularly in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease .
Angina may occur in patients with coronary artery disease .
The potential for epinephrine to produce these types of adverse reactions does not contraindicate its use in an acute life - threatening allergic reaction .
Accidental injection into the digits , hands or feet may result in loss of blood flow to the affected area ( see WARNINGS ) .
Adverse events experienced as a result of accidental injections may include increased heart rate , local reactions including injection site pallor , coldness and hypoaesthesia or injury at the injection site resulting in bruising , bleeding , discoloration , erythema or skeletal injury .
OVERDOSAGE Epinephrine is rapidly inactivated in the body and treatment following overdose with epinephrine is primarily supportive .
If necessary , pressor effects may be counteracted by rapidly acting vasodilators or alpha - adrenergic blocking drugs .
If prolonged hypotension follows such measure , it may be necessary to administer another pressor drug .
Overdosage of epinephrine may produce extremely elevated arterial pressure , which may result in cerebrovascular hemorrhage , particularly in elderly patients .
Overdosage may also result in pulmonary edema because of peripheral vascular constriction together with cardiac stimulation .
Treatment consists of a rapidly acting alpha - adrenergic blocking drug and / or respiratory support .
Epinephrine overdosage can also cause transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia and these may be accompanied by potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias .
Premature ventricular contractions may appear within one minute after injection and may be followed by multifocal ventricular tachycardia ( prefibrillation rhythm ) .
Subsidence of the ventricular effects may be followed by atrial tachycardia and occasionally by atrioventricular block .
Treatment of arrhythmias consists of administration of a beta - blocking drug such as propranolol .
Overdosage sometimes results in extreme pallor and coldness of the skin , metabolic acidosis and kidney failure .
Suitable corrective measures must be taken in such situations .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION EpiPen ® or EpiPen ® Jr Auto - Injector prescribers should ensure that the patient or caregiver understands the indications and use of this product .
A health care provider should review the patient instructions and operation of the EpiPen ® or EpiPen ® Jr Auto - Injector , in detail , with the patient or caregiver .
