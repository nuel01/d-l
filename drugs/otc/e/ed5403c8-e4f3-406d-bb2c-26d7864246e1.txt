DRUG INTERACTIONS Anticoagulants Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion , USP may induce temporary resistance to prothrombin - depressing anticoagulants , especially when larger doses of Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion , USP are used .
Should this occur , higher doses of anticoagulant therapy may be needed when resuming anticoagulant therapy , or a change in therapy to a different class of anticoagulant may be necessare ( i . e . , heparin sodium ) .

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The preservative benzyl alcohol can cause serious adverse events and death when administgered intravenously to neonates and infants .
If Phytonadione is needed during pregnancy , consider using a benzyl alcohol - free formulation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Published studies with the use of phytonadione during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with phytonadione and adverse developmental outcomes ( see Data ) .
There are maternal and fetal risks associated with vitamin K deficiency during pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with phytonadione .
The estimated background risk for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk Pregnant women with vitamin K deficiency hypoprothrombinemia may be at an increased risk for bleeding diatheses during pregnancy and hemorrhagic events at delivery .
Subclinical maternal vitamin K deficiency during pregnancy has been implicated in rare cases of fetal intracranial hemorrhage .
Data Human Data Phytonadione has been measured in cord blood of infants whose mothers were treated with phytonadione during pregnancy in concentrations lower than seen in maternal plasma .
Administration of vitamin K1 to pregnant women shortly before delivery increased both maternal and cord blood concentrations .
Published data do not report a clear association with phytonadione and adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when used during pregnancy .
However , these studies cannot definitively establish the absence of any risk because of methodologic limitations including small sample size and lack of blinding .
Animal Data In pregnant rats receiving vitamin K1 orally , fetal plasma and liver concentrations increased following administration , supporting placental transfer .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary If available , preservative - free Phytonadione is recommended when Phytonadione is needed during lactation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Phytonadione is present in breastmilk .
There are not data on the effects of Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion , USP on the breastfed child or on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the clinical need for Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion , USP and any potential adverse effects on the breasfed child from Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion , USP or from the underlying maternal condition .
Serious adverse reactions including fatal reactions and the " gasping syndrome " occurred in premature neonates and infants in the intensive care unit who received drugs containing benzyl alcohol as a preservative .
In these cases , benzyl alcohol dosages of 99 to 234 mg / kg / day produced high levels of benzyl alcohol and its metabolites in the blood and urine ( blood levels of benzyl alcohol were 0 . 61 to 1 . 378 mmol / L ) .
Additional adverse reactions included gradual neurological deterioration , seizures , intracranial hemorrhage , hematologic aabnormalities , skin breakdown , hepatic and renal failure , hypotension , bradycardia , and cardiovascular collapse .
Preterm , low - birth weight infants may be more likely to develop these reactions because they may be less able to metabolize benzyl alcohol .
When prescribing Phytonadione in infants consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources including Phytonadione and other drugs containing benzyl alcohol .
The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which serious adverse reactions may occur is not known [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Whenever possible , use preservative - free phytonadione formulations in neonates .
The preservative benzyl alcohol has been associated with serious adverse events and death in pediatric patients .
Premature and low - birth weight infants may be more likely to develop toxicity .
• Pregnancy : If available , use the preservative - free formulation in pregnant women .
( 8 . 1 ) • Lactation : If available , use the preservative - free formulation in lactating women .
( 8 . 2 ) • Pediatric Use : The safety and effectiveness of Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion , USP in pediatric patients from 6 months from 17 years have not been established .
( 8 . 4 ) OVERDOSAGE Hemolysis , jaundice , and hyperbilirubinemia in newborns , particuarly in premature infants , may result from Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion , USP overdose .
DESCRIPTION Phytonadione is a vitamin K replacement , which is a clear , yellow to amber , viscous , odorless or nearly odorless liquid .
It is insoluble in water , soluble in chloroform and slightly soluble in ethanol .
It has a molecular weight of 450 . 70 .
Phytonadoine is 2 - methyl - 3 - phyty - 1 , 4 - naphthoquinone .
Its empirical formula is C31H46O2 and its molecular structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion , USP injection is a yellow , sterile , aqueous colloidal solution of vitamin K1 , with a pH of 3 . 5 to 7 . 0 , available for injection by the intravenous , intramuscular , and subcutaneous routes .
Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion , USP is available in 1 mg ( 1 mg / 0 . 5 mL ) single - dose vials .
Each 0 . 5 mL of Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion , USP contains the following inactive ingredients : 10 mg polysorbate 80 , 10 . 4 mg propylene glycol , 0 . 17 mg sodium acetate anhydrous may have been added to adjust pH to meet USP limits of 3 . 5 to 7 . 0 .
The air above the liquid in the individual containers has been displaced by flushing with nitrogen during the filling operation .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINCIAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion , USP aqueous colloidal solution of vitamin K1 for parenteral injection , possesses the same type and degree of activity as does naturally - occurring vitamin K , which is necessary for the production via the liver of active prothrombin ( factor II ) , proconvertin ( factor VII ) , plasma thromboplastin component ( factor IX ) , and Stuart factor ( factor X ) .
Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for a microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the posttranslational carboxylation of myltiple , specific , peptide - bound glutamic acid residues in inactive hepatic precursors of factors II , VII , IX , and X .
The resulting gamma - car - boxy - glutamic acid residues convert the precursors into active coagulation factors that are subsequently secreted by liver cells into the blood .
In normal animals and humans , phytonadione is virtually devoid of activity .
However , in animals and humans deficient in vitamin K , the pharmacological action of vitamin K is related to its normal physiological function , that is , to promote the hepatic biosynthesis of vitamin K dependent clotting factors .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The action of the aqueous dispersion , when administered intravenously , is generally detectable within an hour or two and hemorrhage is usually controlled within 3 to 6 hours .
A normal INR may often be obtained in 12 to 14 hours .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption : Phytonadione is readily absorbed following intramuscular administration .
Distribution : After absorption phytonadione is initially concentrated in the liver , but the concentration declines rapidly .
Very little vitamin K accumulates in tissues .
Elimination : Little is known about the metabolic fate of vitamin K . Almost no free unmetabolized vitamin K appears in bile or urine .
NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY SECTION 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Studies of carcinogenicity , genotoxicity or impairment of fertility have not been conducted with phytonadione .
