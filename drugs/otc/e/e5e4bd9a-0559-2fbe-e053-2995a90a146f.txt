11 DESCRIPTION 11 . 1 Chemical Characteristics CERIANNA contains fluoroestradiol fluorine 18 ( F 18 ) , a synthetic estrogen analog .
Chemically , fluoroestradiol F 18 is [ 18 F ] 16α - fluoro - 3 , 17β - diol - estratriene - 1 , 3 , 5 ( 10 ) .
The molecular weight is 289 . 37 , and the structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] CERIANNA is a sterile , clear , colorless solution for intravenous injection , with an osmolarity of 340 mOsm .
Its pH ranges between 4 . 5 to 7 . 0 .
The composition of the final product in 40 mL solution is fluoroestradiol no more than 5 μg , fluoroestradiol F 18 148 MBq / mL to 3 , 700 MBq / mL ( 4 mCi / mL to 100 mCi / mL ) , sodium ascorbate 0 . 44 % w / v in sodium chloride 0 . 9 % w / v , and ethanol no more than 3 . 2 % w / v ..
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 11 . 2 Physical Characteristics CERIANNA is radiolabeled with F 18 , a cyclotron produced radionuclide that decays by positron emission to stable oxygen 18 with a half - life of 109 . 8 minutes .
The principal photons useful for diagnostic imaging are the coincident pair of 511 keV gamma photons , resulting from the interaction of the emitted positron with an electron ( Table 2 ) .
Table 2 Principal Radiation Produced from Decay of Fluorine 18 RadiationEnergy ( keV ) % Abundance Positron 249 . 8 96 . 9 Gamma 511 193 . 5 11 . 3 External Radiation The point source air - kerma coefficient for F 18 is 3 . 75 x 10 - 17 Gy m 2 / ( Bq s ) .
The first half - value thickness of lead ( Pb ) for F 18 gamma rays is approximately 6 mm .
The relative reduction of radiation emitted by F 18 that results from various thicknesses of lead shielding is shown in Table 3 .
The use of 8 cm of Pb will decrease the radiation transmission ( i . e . , exposure ) by a factor of about 10 , 000 .
Table 3 Radiation Attenuation of 511 keV Gamma Rays by Lead ShieldingShield Thickness cm of Lead ( Pb ) Coefficient of Attenuation 0 . 6 0 . 5 2 0 . 1 4 0 . 01 6 0 . 001 8 0 . 0001 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of action Fluoroestradiol F 18 binds ER .
The following binding affinity : Kd = 0 . 13 ± 0 . 02 nM , Bmax = 1901 ± 89 fmol / mg , and IC50 = 0 . 085 nM , was determined in an ER - positive human breast cancer cell line ( MCF - 7 ) .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The relationship between fluoroestradiol F18 plasma concentrations and image interpretation has not been studied .
Fluoroestradiol F18 uptake measured by PET in human tumors is directly proportional to tumor ER expression measured by in vitro assays .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution After intravenous injection , 95 % of fluoroestradiol F 18 is bound to plasma proteins .
Fluoroestradiol F 18 distributes primarily to hepatobiliary system , and also to small and large intestines , heart wall , blood , kidney , uterus and bladder .
Metabolism Fluoroestradiol F 18 is metabolized in the liver .
At 20 minutes after injection , approximately 20 % of circulating radioactivity in the plasma is in the form of non - metabolized fluoroestradiol F 18 .
At 2 hours after injection , circulating fluoroestradiol F 18 levels are less than 5 % of peak concentration .
Excretion Elimination is by biliary and urinary excretion .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No long - term studies in animals were performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of CERIANNA .
Mutagenesis Fluoroestradiol was evaluated by in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay ( Ames test ) and in vitro L5178Y / TK + / - mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay .
Fluoroestradiol was negative for genotoxicity by Ames test at up to 1 . 25 μg per plate for 5 tester strains ( Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98 , TA100 , TA1535 and TA1537 and Escherichia Coli tester strain WP2 uvrA ) in the presence or absence of S9 metabolic activation .
Fluoroestradiol was negative for genotoxicity by L5178Y / TK + / - mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay at up to 8 ng / mL in the absence or presence of S9 metabolic activation .
Potential in vivo genotoxicity of fluoroestradiol was evaluated in a rat micronucleus assay .
In this assay , fluoroestradiol did not increase the number of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes ( MN - PCEs ) at 51 μg / kg / day , when given for 14 consecutive days .
However , CERIANNA has the potential to be mutagenic because of the F 18 radioisotope .
Impairment of Fertility No studies in animals have been performed to evaluate potential impairment of fertility in males or females .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The effectiveness of CERIANNA for detecting ER - positive non - primary breast cancer lesions was evaluated based on published study reports of fluoroestradiol F 18 .
Study 1 ( NCT01986569 ) enrolled 90 women ( median age 55 years , 39 % premenopausal ) with histologically confirmed invasive breast cancer .
The patients had first known or suspected recurrence of treated breast cancer or stage IV metastatic breast cancer .
Recent biopsy of lesions outside of bone and areas with high physiologic fluoroestradiol F 18 uptake was also required [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Patients concurrently using estrogen receptor modulators or fulvestrant discontinued them 60 days prior to fluoroestradiol F 18 administration .
Concurrent use of aromatase inhibitors was permitted .
Three image readers were blinded to all clinical information , except for the location of the largest biopsied lesion , for which pathologists independently provided an Allred score ( 0 to 8 ) .
The image readers scored the intensity of FES uptake on a three - point scale relative to normal biodistribution as either “ decreased , ” “ equivocal , ” or “ increased ” ( 1 to 3 ) .
Image reader performance for distinguishing between ER - positive and ER - negative fluoroestradiol F 18 uptake was compared to biopsy in 85 patients .
Of the 47 patients with positive biopsy ( Allred score ≥ 3 ) , 36 were positive on imaging ( majority reader score = 3 ) .
Ten of 11 patients with false negative imaging had Allred scores between 3 and 6 [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Of the 38 patients with negative biopsy , all 38 were negative on imaging .
Study 2 ( NCT00602043 ) in 13 patients showed similar results .
