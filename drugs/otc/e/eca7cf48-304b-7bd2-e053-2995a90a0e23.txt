5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Severe , potentially life threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported .
This includes cases of Stevens - Johnson syndrome , hypersensitivity reaction , toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme .
Immediately discontinue treatment if severe hypersensitivity , severe rash or rash with systemic symptoms or liver transaminase elevations develops and monitor clinical status , including liver transaminases closely .
( 5 . 1 ) • Monitor for immune reconstitution syndrome and fat redistribution .
( 5 . 3 , 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Severe Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe , potentially life - threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported .
In clinical trials , these include cases of Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme .
Hypersensitivity reactions including Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms ( DRESS ) have also been reported and were characterized by rash , constitutional findings , and sometimes organ dysfunction , including hepatic failure .
In Phase 3 clinical trials , Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 1 . 3 % of subjects receiving INTELENCE compared to 0 . 2 % of placebo subjects .
A total of 2 . 2 % of HIV - 1 - infected subjects receiving INTELENCE discontinued from Phase 3 trials due to rash [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Rash occurred most commonly during the first 6 weeks of therapy .
The incidence of rash was higher in females [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Stevens - Johnson syndrome was reported in 1 . 1 % ( 2 / 177 ) of pediatric patients less than 18 years of age receiving INTELENCE in combination with other HIV - 1 antiretroviral agents in an observational study .
Discontinue INTELENCE immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop ( including , but not limited to , severe rash or rash accompanied by fever , general malaise , fatigue , muscle or joint aches , blisters , oral lesions , conjunctivitis , facial edema , hepatitis , eosinophilia , angioedema ) .
Clinical status including liver transaminases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated .
Delay in stopping INTELENCE treatment after the onset of severe rash may result in a life - threatening reaction .
5 . 2 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions The concomitant use of INTELENCE and other drugs may result in potentially significant drug interactions , some of which may lead to [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] : • Loss of therapeutic effect of concomitant drug or INTELENCE and possible development of resistance .
• Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of INTELENCE or other concomitant drugs .
See Table 4 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions , including dosing recommendations .
Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during INTELENCE therapy and review concomitant medications during INTELENCE therapy .
5 . 3 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy , including INTELENCE .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia ( PCP ) or tuberculosis ) , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
Autoimmune disorders ( such as Graves ' disease , polymyositis , Guillain - Barré syndrome , and autoimmune hepatitis ) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution ; however , the time to onset is more variable , and can occur many months after initiation of treatment .
5 . 4 Fat Redistribution Redistribution / accumulation of body fat , including central obesity , dorsocervical fat enlargement ( buffalo hump ) , peripheral wasting , facial wasting , breast enlargement , and " cushingoid appearance " have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy .
The mechanism and long - term consequences of these events are currently unknown .
A causal relationship has not been established .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in greater detail in other sections : • Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
• Immune reconstitution syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
The most common adverse drug reactions of moderate to severe intensity ( at least 2 % ) which occurred at a higher rate than placebo in adults are rash and peripheral neuropathy .
( 6 . 1 ) The most common adverse drug reactions in at least 2 % of pediatric patients are rash and diarrhea .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Janssen Products , LP at 1 - 800 - JANSSEN ( 1 - 800 - 526 - 7736 ) or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Clinical Trials Experience in Adults The safety assessment is based on all data from 1203 subjects in the Phase 3 placebo - controlled trials , TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 , conducted in antiretroviral treatment - experienced HIV - 1 - infected adult subjects , 599 of whom received INTELENCE ( 200 mg twice daily ) .
In these pooled trials , the median exposure for subjects in the INTELENCE arm and placebo arm was 52 . 3 and 51 . 0 weeks , respectively .
Discontinuations due to adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) were 5 . 2 % in the INTELENCE arm and 2 . 6 % in the placebo arm .
The most frequently reported ADR at least Grade 2 in severity was rash ( 10 . 0 % ) .
Stevens - Johnson syndrome , drug hypersensitivity reaction and erythema multiforme were reported in less than 0 . 1 % of subjects during clinical development with INTELENCE [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
A total of 2 . 2 % of HIV - 1 - infected subjects in Phase 3 trials receiving INTELENCE discontinued due to rash .
In general , in clinical trials , rash was mild to moderate , occurred primarily in the second week of therapy , and was infrequent after Week 4 .
Rash generally resolved within 1 to 2 weeks on continued therapy .
The incidence of rash was higher in women compared to men in the INTELENCE arm in the Phase 3 trials ( rash ≥ Grade 2 was reported in 9 / 60 [ 15 . 0 % ] women versus 51 / 539 [ 9 . 5 % ] men ; discontinuations due to rash were reported in 3 / 60 [ 5 . 0 % ] women versus 10 / 539 [ 1 . 9 % ] men ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Patients with a history of NNRTI - related rash did not appear to be at increased risk for the development of INTELENCE - related rash compared to patients without a history of NNRTI - related rash .
Common Adverse Reactions Clinical ADRs of moderate intensity or greater ( greater than or equal to Grade 2 ) and reported in at least 2 % of subjects treated with INTELENCE and occurring at a higher rate compared to placebo ( excess of 1 % ) are presented in Table 2 .
Laboratory abnormalities considered ADRs are included in Table 3 .

AST and ALT abnormalities occurred more frequently in hepatitis B and / or hepatitis C virus co - infected subjects for both treatment groups .
Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening from baseline of AST , ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 27 . 8 % , 25 . 0 % and 7 . 1 % respectively , of INTELENCE - treated co - infected subjects as compared to 6 . 7 % , 7 . 5 % and 1 . 8 % of non - co - infected INTELENCE - treated subjects .
In general , adverse events reported by INTELENCE - treated subjects with hepatitis B and / or hepatitis C virus co - infection were similar to INTELENCE - treated subjects without hepatitis B and / or hepatitis C virus co - infection .
Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Subjects ( 2 Years to Less Than 18 years of age ) The safety assessment in pediatric subjects is based on two single - arm trials .
TMC125 - C213 is a Phase 2 trial in which 101 antiretroviral treatment - experienced HIV - 1 infected pediatric subjects 6 years to less than 18 years of age received INTELENCE in combination with other antiretroviral agents ( Week 24 analysis ) .
TMC125 - C234 / IMPAACT P1090 is a Phase 1 / 2 trial in which 20 antiretroviral treatment - experienced HIV - 1 infected pediatric subjects 2 years to less than 6 years of age received INTELENCE in combination with other antiretroviral agents ( Week 24 analysis ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
In TMC125 - C213 , the frequency , type and severity of adverse drug reactions in pediatric subjects 6 years to less than 18 years of age were comparable to those observed in adult subjects , except for rash which was observed more frequently in pediatric subjects .
The most common adverse drug reactions in at least 2 % of pediatric subjects were rash and diarrhea .
Rash was reported more frequently in female subjects than in male subjects ( rash ≥ Grade 2 was reported in 13 / 64 [ 20 . 3 % ] females versus 2 / 37 [ 5 . 4 % ] males ; discontinuations due to rash were reported in 4 / 64 [ 6 . 3 % ] females versus 0 / 37 [ 0 % ] males ) .
Rash ( greater than or equal to Grade 2 ) occurred in 15 % of pediatric subjects from 6 years to less than 18 years of age .
In the majority of cases , rash was mild to moderate , of macular / papular type , and occurred in the second week of therapy .
Rash was self - limiting and generally resolved within 1 week on continued therapy .
The safety profile for subjects who completed 48 weeks of treatment was similar to the safety profile for subjects who completed 24 weeks of treatment .
In TMC125 - C234 / IMPAACT P1090 , the frequency , type and severity of adverse drug reactions in pediatric subjects 2 years to less than 6 years of age through Week 24 were comparable to those observed in adults .
The most common adverse drug reactions ( any grade ) of pediatric subjects were rash ( 50 % [ 10 / 20 ] ) and diarrhea ( 25 % [ 5 / 20 ] ) .
In this age group , no subjects had Grade 3 or Grade 4 rash and no subjects discontinued prematurely due to rash .
One subject discontinued etravirine due to asymptomatic lipase elevation .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following events have been identified during postmarketing use of INTELENCE .
Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Immune System Disorders : Severe hypersensitivity reactions including DRESS and cases of hepatic failure have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : rhabdomyolysis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Fatal cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens - Johnson syndrome have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Co - administration of INTELENCE with other drugs can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentrations of etravirine .
The potential drug - drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy .
( 7 , 12 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect INTELENCE Etravirine is a substrate of CYP3A , CYP2C9 , and CYP2C19 .
Therefore , co - administration of INTELENCE with drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A , CYP2C9 , and CYP2C19 may alter the therapeutic effect or adverse reaction profile of INTELENCE ( see Table 4 ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Potential for INTELENCE to Affect Other Drugs Etravirine is an inducer of CYP3A and inhibitor of CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 and P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) .
Therefore , co - administration of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A , CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 or are transported by P - gp with INTELENCE may alter the therapeutic effect or adverse reaction profile of the co - administered drug ( s ) ( see Table 4 ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 3 Significant Drug Interactions Table 4 shows significant drug interactions based on which , alterations in dose or regimen of INTELENCE and / or co - administered drug may be recommended .
Drugs that are not recommended for co - administration with INTELENCE are also included in Table 4 [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Table 4 : Significant Drug InteractionsConcomitant Drug Class : Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Etravirine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment ↑ = increase ; ↓ = decrease ; ↔ = no change HIV - antiviral agents : integrase strand inhibitors dolutegravir [ 1 ] ↓ dolutegravir ↔ etravirine Etravirine significantly reduced plasma concentrations of dolutegravir .
Using cross - study comparisons to historical pharmacokinetic data for etravirine , dolutegravir did not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of etravirine .
dolutegravir / darunavir / ritonavir null ↓ dolutegravir ↔ etravirine The effect of etravirine on dolutegravir plasma concentrations was mitigated by co - administration of darunavir / ritonavir or lopinavir / ritonavir , and is expected to be mitigated by atazanavir / ritonavir .
Dolutegravir should only be used with INTELENCE when co - administered with atazanavir / ritonavir , darunavir / ritonavir , or lopinavir / ritonavir .
dolutegravir / lopinavir / ritonavir null ↔ dolutegravir ↔ etravirine HIV - antiviral agents : non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NNRTIs ) efavirenz null nevirapine null ↓ etravirine Combining two NNRTIs has not been shown to be beneficial .
Concomitant use of INTELENCE with efavirenz or nevirapine may cause a significant decrease in the plasma concentrations of etravirine and loss of therapeutic effect of INTELENCE .
Co - administration of INTELENCE and other NNRTIs is not recommended .
delavirdine ↑ etravirine Combining two NNRTIs has not been shown to be beneficial .
INTELENCE and delavirdine should not be co - administered .
rilpivirine ↓ rilpivirine ↔ etravirine Combining two NNRTIs has not been shown to be beneficial .
Co - administration of INTELENCE and rilpivirine is not recommended .
HIV - antiviral agents : protease inhibitors ( PIs ) atazanavir null ( without ritonavir ) ↓ atazanavir Co - administration of INTELENCE and atazanavir without low - dose ritonavir is not recommended .
atazanavir / ritonavir null ↓ atazanavir ↔ etravirine Concomitant use of INTELENCE with atazanavir / ritonavir decreased atazanavir C min but it is not considered clinically relevant .
The mean systemic exposure ( AUC ) of etravirine after co - administration of INTELENCE with atazanavir / ritonavir in HIV - infected subjects was similar to the mean systemic exposure of etravirine observed in the Phase 3 trials after co - administration of INTELENCE and darunavir / ritonavir ( as part of the background regimen ) .
INTELENCE and atazanavir / ritonavir can be co - administered without dose adjustments .
atazanavir / cobicistat ↓ atazanavir ↓ cobicistat Co - administration of INTELENCE with atazanavir / cobicistat is not recommended because it may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance to atazanavir .
darunavir / ritonavir null ↓ etravirine The mean systemic exposure ( AUC ) of etravirine was reduced when INTELENCE was co - administered with darunavir / ritonavir .
Because all subjects in the Phase 3 trials received darunavir / ritonavir as part of the background regimen and etravirine exposures from these trials were determined to be safe and effective , INTELENCE and darunavir / ritonavir can be co - administered without dose adjustments .
darunavir / cobicistat ↓ cobicistat darunavir : effect unknown Co - administration of INTELENCE with darunavir / cobicistat is not recommended because it may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance to darunavir .
fosamprenavir ( without ritonavir ) ↑ amprenavir Concomitant use of INTELENCE with fosamprenavir without low - dose ritonavir may cause a significant alteration in the plasma concentration of amprenavir .
Co - administration of INTELENCE and fosamprenavir without low - dose ritonavir is not recommended .
fosamprenavir / ritonavir null ↑ amprenavir Due to a significant increase in the systemic exposure of amprenavir , the appropriate doses of the combination of INTELENCE and fosamprenavir / ritonavir have not been established .
Co - administration of INTELENCE and fosamprenavir / ritonavir is not recommended .
indinavir null ( without ritonavir ) ↓ indinavir Concomitant use of INTELENCE with indinavir without low - dose ritonavir may cause a significant alteration in the plasma concentration of indinavir .
Co - administration of INTELENCE and indinavir without low - dose ritonavir is not recommended .
lopinavir / ritonavir null ↓ etravirine The mean systemic exposure ( AUC ) of etravirine was reduced after co - administration of INTELENCE with lopinavir / ritonavir ( tablet ) .
Because the reduction in the mean systemic exposures of etravirine in the presence of lopinavir / ritonavir is similar to the reduction in mean systemic exposures of etravirine in the presence of darunavir / ritonavir , INTELENCE and lopinavir / ritonavir can be co - administered without dose adjustments .
nelfinavir ( without ritonavir ) ↑ nelfinavir Concomitant use of INTELENCE with nelfinavir without low - dose ritonavir may cause a significant alteration in the plasma concentration of nelfinavir .
Co - administration of INTELENCE and nelfinavir without low - dose ritonavir is not recommended .
ritonavir null ↓ etravirine Concomitant use of INTELENCE with ritonavir 600 mg twice daily may cause a significant decrease in the plasma concentration of etravirine and loss of therapeutic effect of INTELENCE .
Co - administration of INTELENCE and ritonavir 600 mg twice daily is not recommended .
saquinavir / ritonavir null ↓ etravirine The mean systemic exposure ( AUC ) of etravirine was reduced when INTELENCE was co - administered with saquinavir / ritonavir .
Because the reduction in the mean systemic exposures of etravirine in the presence of saquinavir / ritonavir is similar to the reduction in mean systemic exposures of etravirine in the presence of darunavir / ritonavir , INTELENCE and saquinavir / ritonavir can be co - administered without dose adjustments .
tipranavir / ritonavir null ↓ etravirine Concomitant use of INTELENCE with tipranavir / ritonavir may cause a significant decrease in the plasma concentrations of etravirine and loss of therapeutic effect of INTELENCE .
Co - administration of INTELENCE and tipranavir / ritonavir is not recommended .
CCR5 antagonists maraviroc null ↔ etravirine ↓ maraviroc When INTELENCE is co - administered with maraviroc in the absence of a potent CYP3A inhibitor ( e . g . , ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor ) , the recommended dose of maraviroc is 600 mg twice daily .
No dose adjustment of INTELENCE is needed .
maraviroc / darunavir / ritonavir null [ 2 ] ↔ etravirine ↑ maraviroc When INTELENCE is co - administered with maraviroc in the presence of a potent CYP3A inhibitor ( e . g . , ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor ) , the recommended dose of maraviroc is 150 mg twice daily .
No dose adjustment of INTELENCE is needed .
Other agents Antiarrhythmics : digoxin null ↔ etravirine ↑ digoxin For patients who are initiating a combination of INTELENCE and digoxin , the lowest dose of digoxin should initially be prescribed .
For patients on a stable digoxin regimen and initiating INTELENCE , no dose adjustment of either INTELENCE or digoxin is needed .
The serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored and used for titration of the digoxin dose to obtain the desired clinical effect .
amiodarone bepridil disopyramide flecainide lidocaine ( systemic ) mexiletine propafenone quinidine ↓ antiarrhythmics Concentrations of these antiarrhythmics may be decreased when co - administered with INTELENCE .
INTELENCE and antiarrhythmics should be co - administered with caution .
Drug concentration monitoring is recommended , if available .
Anticoagulant : warfarin ↑ anticoagulants Warfarin concentrations may be increased when co - administered with INTELENCE .
The international normalized ratio ( INR ) should be monitored when warfarin is combined with INTELENCE .
Anticonvulsants : carbamazepine phenobarbital phenytoin ↓ etravirine Carbamazepine , phenobarbital and phenytoin are inducers of CYP450 enzymes .
INTELENCE should not be used in combination with carbamazepine , phenobarbital , or phenytoin as co - administration may cause significant decreases in etravirine plasma concentrations and loss of therapeutic effect of INTELENCE .
Antifungals : fluconazole null ↑ etravirine ↔ fluconazole Co - administration of etravirine and fluconazole significantly increased etravirine exposures .
The amount of safety data at these increased etravirine exposures is limited , therefore , etravirine and fluconazole should be co - administered with caution .
No dose adjustment of INTELENCE or fluconazole is needed .
voriconazole null ↑ voriconazole Co - administration of etravirine and voriconazole significantly increased etravirine exposures .
The amount of safety data at these increased etravirine exposures is limited , therefore , etravirine and voriconazole should be co - administered with caution .
No dose adjustment of INTELENCE or voriconazole is needed .
Antifungals : itraconazole ketoconazole posaconazole ↑ etravirine ↓ itraconazole ↓ ketoconazole ↔ posaconazole Posaconazole , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , may increase plasma concentrations of etravirine .
Itraconazole and ketoconazole are potent inhibitors as well as substrates of CYP3A4 .
Concomitant systemic use of itraconazole or ketoconazole and INTELENCE may increase plasma concentrations of etravirine .
Simultaneously , plasma concentrations of itraconazole or ketoconazole may be decreased by INTELENCE .
Dose adjustments for itraconazole , ketoconazole or posaconazole may be necessary depending on the other co - administered drugs .
Antiinfective : clarithromycin null ↑ etravirine ↓ clarithromycin ↑ 14 - OH - clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was decreased by INTELENCE ; however , concentrations of the active metabolite , 14 - hydroxy - clarithromycin , were increased .
Because 14 - hydroxy - clarithromycin has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium complex ( MAC ) , overall activity against this pathogen may be altered .
Alternatives to clarithromycin , such as azithromycin , should be considered for the treatment of MAC .
Antimalarial : artemether / lumefantrine null ↔ etravirine ↓ artemether ↓ dihydroartemisinin ↓ lumefantrine Caution is warranted when co - administering INTELENCE and artemether / lumefantrine as it is unknown whether the decrease in exposure of artemether or its active metabolite , dihydroartemisinin , could result in decreased antimalarial efficacy .
No dose adjustment is needed for INTELENCE .
Antimycobacterials : rifampin rifapentine ↓ etravirine Rifampin and rifapentine are potent inducers of CYP450 enzymes .
INTELENCE should not be used with rifampin or rifapentine as co - administration may cause significant decreases in etravirine plasma concentrations and loss of therapeutic effect of INTELENCE .
Antimycobacterial : rifabutin null ↓ etravirine ↓ rifabutin ↓ 25 - O - desacetylrifabutin If INTELENCE is NOT co - administered with a protease inhibitor / ritonavir , then rifabutin at a dose of 300 mg once daily is recommended .
If INTELENCE is co - administered with darunavir / ritonavir , lopinavir / ritonavir or saquinavir / ritonavir , then rifabutin should not be co - administered due to the potential for significant reductions in etravirine exposure .
Benzodiazepine : diazepam ↑ diazepam Concomitant use of INTELENCE with diazepam may increase plasma concentrations of diazepam .
A decrease in diazepam dose may be needed .
Corticosteroid : dexamethasone ( systemic ) ↓ etravirine Systemic dexamethasone induces CYP3A and can decrease etravirine plasma concentrations .
This may result in loss of therapeutic effect of INTELENCE .
Systemic dexamethasone should be used with caution or alternatives should be considered , particularly for long - term use .
Herbal products : St . John ' s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) ↓ etravirine Concomitant use of INTELENCE with products containing St . John ' s wort may cause significant decreases in etravirine plasma concentrations and loss of therapeutic effect of INTELENCE .
INTELENCE and products containing St . John ' s wort should not be co - administered .
Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) direct - acting antivirals : daclatasvir ↓ daclatasvir Co - administration of INTELENCE with daclatasvir may decrease daclatasvir concentrations .
Increase the daclatasvir dose to 90 mg once daily .
elbasvir / grazoprevir ↓ elbasvir ↓ grazoprevir Co - administration of INTELENCE with elbasvir / grazoprevir may decrease elbasvir and grazoprevir concentrations , leading to reduced therapeutic effect of elbasvir / grazoprevir .
Co - administration is not recommended .
simeprevir ↓ simeprevir Co - administration of INTELENCE with simeprevir may decrease simeprevir concentrations .
Co - administration is not recommended .
HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors : atorvastatin null ↔ etravirine ↓ atorvastatin ↑ 2 - OH - atorvastatin The combination of INTELENCE and atorvastatin can be given without dose adjustments , however , the dose of atorvastatin may need to be altered based on clinical response .
pravastatin rosuvastatin ↔ etravirine ↔ pravastatin ↔ rosuvastatin No interaction between pravastatin , rosuvastatin and INTELENCE is expected .
lovastatin simvastatin ↓ lovastatin ↓ simvastatin Lovastatin and simvastatin are CYP3A substrates and co - administration with INTELENCE may result in lower plasma concentrations of the HMG - CoA reductase inhibitor .
fluvastatin pitavastatin ↑ fluvastatin ↑ pitavastatin Fluvastatin and pitavastatin are metabolized by CYP2C9 and co - administration with INTELENCE may result in higher plasma concentrations of the HMG - CoA reductase inhibitor .
Dose adjustments for these HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors may be necessary .
Immunosuppressants : cyclosporine sirolimus tacrolimus ↓ immunosuppressant INTELENCE and systemic immunosuppressants should be co - administered with caution because plasma concentrations of cyclosporine , sirolimus , or tacrolimus may be affected .
Narcotic analgesics / treatment of opioid dependence : buprenorphine buprenorphine / naloxone null methadone null ↔ etravirine ↓ buprenorphine ↔ norbuprenorphine ↔ methadone INTELENCE and buprenorphine ( or buprenorphine / naloxone ) can be co - administered without dose adjustments , however , clinical monitoring for withdrawal symptoms is recommended as buprenorphine ( or buprenorphine / naloxone ) maintenance therapy may need to be adjusted in some patients .
INTELENCE and methadone can be co - administered without dose adjustments , however , clinical monitoring for withdrawal symptoms is recommended as methadone maintenance therapy may need to be adjusted in some patients .
Phosphodiesterase type 5 ( PDE - 5 ) inhibitors : sildenafil null tadalafil vardenafil ↓ sildenafil ↓ N - desmethyl - sildenafil INTELENCE and sildenafil can be co - administered without dose adjustments , however , the dose of sildenafil may need to be altered based on clinical effect .
Platelet aggregation inhibitors : clopidogrel ↓ clopidogrel ( active ) metabolite Activation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite may be decreased when clopidogrel is co - administered with INTELENCE .
Alternatives to clopidogrel should be considered .
[ 1 ] The interaction between INTELENCE and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study .
All other drug interactions shown are predicted .
[ 2 ] The reference for etravirine exposure is the pharmacokinetic parameters of etravirine in the presence of darunavir / ritonavir .
7 . 4 Drugs Without Clinically Significant Interactions with INTELENCE In addition to the drugs included in Table 4 , the interaction between INTELENCE and the following drugs were evaluated in clinical studies and no dose adjustment is needed for either drug [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] : didanosine , enfuvirtide ( ENF ) , ethinylestradiol / norethindrone , omeprazole , paroxetine , raltegravir , ranitidine , and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Breastfeeding is not recommended due to the potential for HIV - 1 transmission .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to INTELENCE during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry ( APR ) at 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
Risk Summary Prospective pregnancy data from clinical trials and the APR are not sufficient to adequately assess the risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Etravirine use during pregnancy has been evaluated in a limited number of individuals as reported by the APR , and available data show 1 birth defect in 66 first trimester exposures to etravirine - containing regimens ( see Data ) .
The estimated background rate for major birth defects is 2 . 7 % in the U . S . reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program ( MACDP ) .
The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR .
The estimated background rate of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies in the U . S . general population is 15 – 20 % .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In animal reproduction studies , no adverse developmental effects were observed with orally administered etravirine at exposures equivalent to those at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 400 mg daily ( see Data ) .
Data Human Data Based on prospective reports to the APR of 116 live births following exposure to etravirine - containing regimens during pregnancy ( including 66 exposed in the first trimester and 38 exposed in the second / third trimester ) , the number of birth defects in live births for etravirine was 1 out of 66 with first trimester exposure and 0 out of 38 with second / third trimester exposure .
Prospective reports from the APR of overall major birth defects in pregnancies exposed to INTELENCE is compared with a U . S . background major birth defect rate .
Methodological limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group .
Limitations of using an external comparator include differences in methodology and populations , as well as confounding due to the underlying disease ; these limitations preclude an accurate comparison of outcomes .
INTELENCE ( 200 mg twice daily ) in combination with other antiretroviral agents was evaluated in a clinical trial enrolling 15 pregnant subjects during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and postpartum .
Thirteen subjects completed the trial through postpartum period ( 6 – 12 weeks after delivery ) .
The pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that exposure to total etravirine was generally higher during pregnancy compared with postpartum [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Among subjects who were virologically suppressed ( HIV - 1 RNA less than 50 copies / mL ) at baseline ( 9 / 13 ) , virologic suppression was maintained through the third trimester and postpartum period .
Among subjects with HIV - 1 RNA greater than 50 copies / mL and less than 400 copies / mL at baseline ( 3 / 13 ) , viral loads remained less than 400 copies / mL .
In one subject with HIV - 1 RNA greater than 1 , 000 copies / mL at baseline ( 1 / 13 ) , HIV - 1 RNA remained greater than 1 , 000 copies / mL during the study period .
Thirteen infants were born to 13 HIV - infected pregnant individuals in this study .
HIV - 1 test results were not available for 2 infants .
Among the eleven infants with HIV - 1 test results available , who were born to 11 HIV - infected pregnant individuals who completed the study , all had test results that were negative for HIV - 1 at the time of delivery .
No unexpected safety findings were observed compared with the known safety profile of INTELENCE in non - pregnant adults .
Animal Data Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were performed in rats ( at 250 , 500 and 1 , 000 mg / kg / day ) and rabbits ( at 125 , 250 and 375 mg / kg / day ) administered etravirine on gestation days 6 through 16 , and 6 through 19 , respectively .
In both species , no treatment - related embryo - fetal effects were observed .
In addition , no treatment - related effects were observed in a pre - and postnatal development study performed in rats administered oral doses up to 500 mg / kg / day on gestation days 7 through lactation day 7 .
The systemic drug exposures achieved at the high dose in these animal studies were equivalent to those at the MRHD .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV - 1 - infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV .
Based on limited data , etravirine has been shown to be present in human breast milk .
There are no data on the effects of etravirine on the breastfed infant , or the effects of etravirine on milk production .
Because of the potential for ( 1 ) HIV - 1 transmission ( in HIV - negative infants ) , ( 2 ) developing viral resistance ( in HIV - positive infants ) and ( 3 ) adverse reactions in breastfed infants similar to those seen in adults , instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving INTELENCE .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of INTELENCE have been established for the treatment of HIV - infected pediatric patients from 2 years of age to less than 18 years [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Use of INTELENCE in pediatric patients 2 years to less than 18 years of age is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies of INTELENCE in adults with additional data from two Phase 2 trials in treatment - experienced pediatric subjects , TMC125 - C213 , 6 years to less than 18 years of age ( N = 101 ) and TMC125 - C234 / IMPAACT P1090 , 2 years to less than 6 years of age ( N = 20 ) .
Both studies were open - label , single arm trials of etravirine plus an optimized background regimen .
In clinical trials , the safety , pharmacokinetics , and efficacy were comparable to that observed in adults except for rash ( greater than or equal to Grade 2 ) which was observed more frequently in pediatric subjects [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Postmarketing reports of Stevens - Johnson syndrome in pediatric patients receiving INTELENCE have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Treatment with INTELENCE is not recommended in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Five HIV - infected subjects from 1 year to < 2 years of age were enrolled in TMC125 - C234 / IMPAACT P1090 .
Etravirine exposure was lower than reported in HIV - infected adults ( AUC 12 h geometric mean ratio [ 90 % CI ] was 0 . 59 [ 0 . 34 , 1 . 01 ] for pediatric subjects from 1 year to < 2 years of age compared to adults ) .
Virologic failure at Week 24 ( confirmed HIV - RNA greater than or equal to 400 copies / mL ) occurred in 3 of 4 evaluable subjects who discontinued before or had reached Week 24 .
Genotypic and phenotypic resistance to etravirine developed in 1 of the 3 subjects who experienced virologic failure .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of INTELENCE did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years of age and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment of INTELENCE is required in patients with mild ( Child - Pugh Class A ) or moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B ) hepatic impairment .
The pharmacokinetics of INTELENCE have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment Since the renal clearance of etravirine is negligible ( less than 1 . 2 % ) , a decrease in total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment .
No dose adjustments are required in patients with renal impairment .
As etravirine is highly bound to plasma proteins , it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no specific antidote for overdose with INTELENCE .
Human experience of overdose with INTELENCE is limited .
The highest dose studied in healthy volunteers was 400 mg once daily .
Treatment of overdose with INTELENCE consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient .
Because etravirine is highly protein bound , dialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal of the active substance .
11 DESCRIPTION INTELENCE ( etravirine ) is a non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) .
The chemical name for etravirine is 4 - [ [ 6 - amino - 5 - bromo - 2 - [ ( 4 - cyanophenyl ) amino ] - 4 - pyrimidinyl ] oxy ] - 3 , 5 - dimethylbenzonitrile .
Its molecular formula is C 20 H 15 BrN 6 O and its molecular weight is 435 . 28 .
Etravirine has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Etravirine is a white to slightly yellowish - brown powder .
Etravirine is practically insoluble in water over a wide pH range .
It is very slightly soluble in propylene glycol and slightly soluble in ethanol .
Etravirine is soluble in polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) 400 and freely soluble in some organic solvents ( e . g . , N , N - dimethylformamide and tetrahydrofuran ) .
INTELENCE 25 mg tablets are available as white to off - white , oval scored tablets for oral administration .
Each 25 mg tablet contains 25 mg of etravirine and the inactive ingredients colloidal silicon dioxide , croscarmellose sodium , hypromellose , lactose monohydrate , magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose .
INTELENCE 100 mg tablets are available as white to off - white , oval tablets for oral administration .
Each 100 mg tablet contains 100 mg of etravirine and the inactive ingredients colloidal silicon dioxide , croscarmellose sodium , hypromellose , lactose monohydrate , magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose .
INTELENCE 200 mg tablets are available as white to off - white , biconvex , oblong tablets for oral administration .
Each 200 mg tablet contains 200 mg of etravirine and the inactive ingredients colloidal silicon dioxide , croscarmellose sodium , hypromellose , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose and silicified microcrystalline cellulose .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Etravirine is an antiretroviral drug [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a thorough QT / QTc study in 41 healthy subjects , INTELENCE 200 mg twice daily or 400 mg once daily did not affect the QT / QTc interval .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic properties of INTELENCE were determined in healthy adult subjects and in treatment - experienced HIV - 1 - infected adult and pediatric subjects .
The systemic exposures ( AUC ) to etravirine were lower in HIV - 1 - infected subjects ( Table 5 ) than in healthy subjects .
Table 5 : Population Pharmacokinetic Estimates of Etravirine 200 mg Twice Daily in HIV - 1 - Infected Adult Subjects ( Integrated Data from Phase 3 Trials at Week 48 ) [ 1 ] Parameter Etravirine N = 575 AUC 12 h ( ng ∙ h / mL ) Geometric mean ± standard deviation 4522 ± 4710 Median ( range ) 4380 ( 458 – 59084 ) C 0 h ( ng / mL ) Geometric mean ± standard deviation 297 ± 391 Median ( range ) 298 ( 2 – 4852 ) [ 1 ] All HIV - 1 - infected subjects enrolled in Phase 3 clinical trials received darunavir / ritonavir 600 / 100 mg twice daily as part of their background regimen .
Therefore , the pharmacokinetic parameter estimates shown in Table 5 account for reductions in the pharmacokinetic parameters of etravirine due to co - administration of INTELENCE with darunavir / ritonavir .
Note : The median protein binding adjusted EC 50 for MT4 cells infected with HIV - 1 / IIIB in vitro equals 4 ng / mL .
Absorption and Bioavailability Following oral administration , etravirine was absorbed with a T max of about 2 . 5 to 4 hours .
The absolute oral bioavailability of INTELENCE is unknown .
In healthy subjects , the absorption of etravirine is not affected by co - administration of oral ranitidine or omeprazole , drugs that increase gastric pH . Effects of Food on Oral Absorption The systemic exposure ( AUC ) to etravirine was decreased by about 50 % when INTELENCE was administered under fasting conditions , as compared to when INTELENCE was administered following a meal .
Within the range of meals studied , the systemic exposures to etravirine were similar .
The total caloric content of the various meals evaluated ranged from 345 kilocalories ( 17 grams fat ) to 1160 kilocalories ( 70 grams fat ) .
Distribution Etravirine is about 99 . 9 % bound to plasma proteins , primarily to albumin ( 99 . 6 % ) and alpha 1 - acid glycoprotein ( 97 . 66 % to 99 . 02 % ) in vitro .
The distribution of etravirine into compartments other than plasma ( e . g . , cerebrospinal fluid , genital tract secretions ) has not been evaluated in humans .
Metabolism In vitro experiments with human liver microsomes ( HLMs ) indicate that etravirine primarily undergoes metabolism by CYP3A , CYP2C9 , and CYP2C19 enzymes .
The major metabolites , formed by methyl hydroxylation of the dimethylbenzonitrile moiety , were at least 90 % less active than etravirine against wild - type HIV in cell culture .
Elimination After single dose oral administration of 800 mg 14 C - etravirine , 93 . 7 % and 1 . 2 % of the administered dose of 14 C - etravirine was recovered in the feces and urine , respectively .
Unchanged etravirine accounted for 81 . 2 % to 86 . 4 % of the administered dose in feces .
Unchanged etravirine was not detected in urine .
The mean ( ± standard deviation ) terminal elimination half - life of etravirine was about 41 ( ± 20 ) hours .
Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Population pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV - infected subjects showed that etravirine pharmacokinetics are not considerably different within the age range ( 18 to 77 years ) evaluated [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of etravirine in 115 treatment - experienced HIV - 1 - infected pediatric subjects , 2 years to less than 18 years of age showed that the administered weight - based dosages resulted in etravirine exposure comparable to that in adults receiving INTELENCE 200 mg twice daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
The pharmacokinetic parameters for etravirine ( AUC 12 h and C 0 h ) are summarized in Table 6 .
Table 6 : Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Etravirine in Treatment - Experienced HIV - 1 - Infected Pediatric Subjects 2 Years to Less Than 18 Years of Age ( TMC125 - C213 [ Population PK ] and TMC125 - C234 / P1090 ) Study TMC125 - C213 TMC125 - C234 / IMPAACT P1090 Age Range ( years ) ( 6 years to less than 18 years ) ( 2 years to less than 6 years ) Parameter N = 101 N = 14 AUC 12 h ( ng ∙ h / mL ) Geometric mean ± standard deviation 3742 ± 4314 3504 ± 2923 Median ( range ) 4499 ( 62 – 28865 ) 3579 ( 1221 – 11815 ) C 0 h ( ng / mL ) Geometric mean ± standard deviation 205 ± 342 183 ± 240 Median ( range ) 287 ( 2 – 2276 ) 162 ( 54 – 908 ) The pharmacokinetics and dose of etravirine in pediatric subjects less than 2 years of age have not been established [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Male and Female Patients No significant pharmacokinetic differences have been observed between males and females .
Racial or Ethnic Groups Population pharmacokinetic analysis of etravirine in HIV - infected subjects did not show an effect of race on exposure to etravirine .
Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of etravirine have not been studied in patients with renal impairment .
The results from a mass balance study with 14 C - etravirine showed that less than 1 . 2 % of the administered dose of etravirine is excreted in the urine as metabolites .
No unchanged drug was detected in the urine .
As etravirine is highly bound to plasma proteins , it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Etravirine is primarily metabolized by the liver .
The steady state pharmacokinetic parameters of etravirine were similar after multiple dose administration of INTELENCE to subjects with normal hepatic function ( 16 subjects ) , mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A , 8 subjects ) , and moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class B , 8 subjects ) .
The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of etravirine has not been evaluated [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Pregnancy and Postpartum After intake of INTELENCE 200 mg twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents ( 13 subjects with 2 NRTIs , 1 subject with 2 NRTIs + lopinavir + ritonavir , 1 subject with 2 NRTIs + raltegravir ) , based on intra - individual comparison , the C max and AUC 12 h of total etravirine were 23 to 42 % higher during pregnancy compared with postpartum ( 6 – 12 weeks ) .
The C min of total etravirine was 78 to 125 % higher during pregnancy compared with postpartum ( 6 – 12 weeks ) , while two subjects had C min < 10 ng / mL in the postpartum period ( 6 – 12 weeks ) [ C min of total etravirine was 11 to 16 % higher when these 2 subjects are excluded ] ( see Table 7 ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Increased etravirine exposures during pregnancy are not considered clinically significant .
The protein binding of etravirine was similar ( > 99 % ) during the second trimester , third trimester , and postpartum period .
Table 7 : Pharmacokinetic Results of Total Etravirine After Administration of Etravirine 200 mg Twice Daily as Part of an Antiretroviral Regimen , During the 2 nd Trimester of Pregnancy , the 3 rd Trimester of Pregnancy , and Postpartum .

Patients with Hepatitis B and / or Hepatitis C Virus Co - Infection Population pharmacokinetic analysis of the TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 trials showed reduced clearance for etravirine in HIV - 1 - infected subjects with hepatitis B and / or C virus co - infection .
Based upon the safety profile of INTELENCE [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] , no dose adjustment is necessary in patients co - infected with hepatitis B and / or C virus .
Drug Interactions Etravirine is a substrate of CYP3A , CYP2C9 , and CYP2C19 .
Therefore , co - administration of INTELENCE with drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A , CYP2C9 , and CYP2C19 may alter the therapeutic effect or adverse reaction profile of INTELENCE .
Etravirine is an inducer of CYP3A and inhibitor of CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 and P - gp .
Therefore , co - administration of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A , CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 or are transported by P - gp with INTELENCE may alter the therapeutic effect or adverse reaction profile of the co - administered drug ( s ) .
Drug interaction studies were performed with INTELENCE and other drugs likely to be co - administered and some drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interactions .
The effects of co - administration of other drugs on the AUC , C max , and C min values of etravirine are summarized in Table 8 ( effect of other drugs on INTELENCE ) .
The effect of co - administration of INTELENCE on the AUC , C max , and C min values of other drugs are summarized in Table 9 ( effect of INTELENCE on other drugs ) .

Etravirine binds directly to reverse transcriptase ( RT ) and blocks the RNA - dependent and DNA - dependent DNA polymerase activities by causing a disruption of the enzyme ' s catalytic site .
Etravirine does not inhibit the human DNA polymerases α , β , and γ .
Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Etravirine exhibited activity against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of wild - type HIV - 1 in acutely infected T - cell lines , human peripheral blood mononuclear cells , and human monocytes / macrophages with median EC 50 values ranging from 0 . 9 to 5 . 5 nM ( i . e . , 0 . 4 to 2 . 4 ng / mL ) .
Etravirine demonstrated antiviral activity in cell culture against a broad panel of HIV - 1 group M isolates ( subtype A , B , C , D , E , F , G ) with EC 50 values ranging from 0 . 29 to 1 . 65 nM and EC 50 values ranging from 11 . 5 to 21 . 7 nM against group O primary isolates .
Etravirine did not show antagonism when studied in combination with the following antiretroviral drugs — the NNRTIs delavirdine , efavirenz , and nevirapine ; the N ( t ) RTIs abacavir , didanosine , emtricitabine , lamivudine , stavudine , tenofovir , and zidovudine ; the PIs amprenavir , atazanavir , darunavir , indinavir , lopinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , saquinavir , and tipranavir ; the gp41 fusion inhibitor ENF ; the integrase strand transfer inhibitor raltegravir and the CCR5 co - receptor antagonist maraviroc .
Resistance In Cell Culture Etravirine - resistant strains were selected in cell culture originating from wild - type HIV - 1 of different origins and subtypes , as well as NNRTI resistant HIV - 1 .
Development of reduced susceptibility to etravirine typically required more than one substitution in reverse transcriptase of which the following were observed most frequently : L100I , E138K , E138G , V179I , Y181C , and M230I .
In Treatment - Experienced Subjects In the Phase 3 trials TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 , substitutions that developed most commonly in subjects with virologic failure at Week 48 to the INTELENCE - containing regimen were V179F , V179I , and Y181C which usually emerged in a background of multiple other NNRTI resistance - associated substitutions .
In all the trials conducted with INTELENCE in HIV - 1 infected subjects , the following substitutions emerged most commonly : L100I , E138G , V179F , V179I , Y181C and H221Y .
Other NNRTI - resistance - associated substitutions which emerged on etravirine treatment in less than 10 % of the virologic failure isolates included K101E / H / P , K103N / R , V106I / M , V108I , Y181I , Y188L , V189I , G190S / C , N348I and R356K .
The emergence of NNRTI substitutions on etravirine treatment contributed to decreased susceptibility to etravirine with a median fold - change in etravirine susceptibility of 40 - fold from reference and a median fold - change of 6 - fold from baseline .
Cross - Resistance Cross - resistance among NNRTIs has been observed .
Cross - resistance to delavirdine , efavirenz , and / or nevirapine is expected after virologic failure with an etravirine - containing regimen .
Virologic failure on a rilpivirine - containing regimen with development of rilpivirine resistance is likely to result in cross - resistance to etravirine ( see Treatment - Naïve HIV - 1 - Infected Subjects in the Phase 3 Trials for EDURANT ( rilpivirine ) below ) .
Cross - resistance to etravirine has been observed after virologic failure on a doravirine - containing regimen with development of doravirine resistance .
Some NNRTI - resistant viruses are susceptible to etravirine , but genotypic and phenotypic testing should guide the use of etravirine ( see Baseline Genotype / Phenotype and Virologic Outcome Analyses below ) .
Site - Directed NNRTI Mutant Virus Etravirine showed antiviral activity against 55 of 65 HIV - 1 strains ( 85 % ) with single amino acid substitutions at RT positions associated with NNRTI resistance , including the most commonly found K103N .
The single amino acid substitutions associated with an etravirine reduction in susceptibility greater than 3 - fold were K101A , K101P , K101Q , E138G , E138Q , Y181C , Y181I , Y181T , Y181V , and M230L , and of these , the greatest reductions were Y181I ( 13 - fold change in EC 50 value ) and Y181V ( 17 - fold change in EC 50 value ) .
Mutant strains containing a single NNRTI resistance - associated substitution ( K101P , K101Q , E138Q , or M230L ) had cross - resistance between etravirine and efavirenz .
The majority ( 39 of 61 ; 64 % ) of the NNRTI mutant viruses with 2 or 3 amino acid substitutions associated with NNRTI resistance had decreased susceptibility to etravirine ( fold - change greater than 3 ) .
The highest levels of resistance to etravirine were observed for HIV - 1 harboring a combination of substitutions V179F + Y181C ( 187 fold - change ) , V179F + Y181I ( 123 fold - change ) , or V179F + Y181C + F227C ( 888 fold - change ) .
Clinical Isolates Etravirine retained a fold - change less than or equal to 3 against 60 % of 6171 NNRTI - resistant clinical isolates .
In the same panel , the proportion of clinical isolates resistant to delavirdine , efavirenz and / or nevirapine ( defined as a fold - change above their respective biological cutoff values in the assay ) was 79 % , 87 % , and 95 % , respectively .
In TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 , 34 % of the baseline isolates had decreased susceptibility to etravirine ( fold - change greater than 3 ) and 60 % , 69 % , and 78 % of all baseline isolates were resistant to delavirdine , efavirenz , and nevirapine , respectively .
Of subjects who received etravirine and were virologic failures in TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 , 90 % , 84 % , and 96 % of viral isolates obtained at the time of treatment failure were resistant to delavirdine , efavirenz , and nevirapine , respectively .
Treatment - Naïve HIV - 1 - Infected Subjects in the Phase 3 Trials for EDURANT ( Rilpivirine ) There are currently no clinical data available on the use of etravirine in subjects who experienced virologic failure on a rilpivirine - containing regimen .
However , in the rilpivirine adult clinical development program , there was evidence of phenotypic cross - resistance between rilpivirine and etravirine .
In the pooled analyses of the Phase 3 clinical trials for rilpivirine , 38 rilpivirine virologic failure subjects had evidence of HIV - 1 strains with genotypic and phenotypic resistance to rilpivirine .
Of these subjects , 89 % ( 34 subjects ) of virologic failure isolates were cross - resistant to etravirine based on phenotype data .
Consequently , it can be inferred that cross - resistance to etravirine is likely after virologic failure and development of rilpivirine resistance .
Refer to the prescribing information for EDURANT ( rilpivirine ) for further information .
Baseline Genotype / Phenotype and Virologic Outcome Analyses In TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 , the presence at baseline of the substitutions L100I , E138A , I167V , V179D , V179F , Y181I , Y181V , or G190S was associated with a decreased virologic response to etravirine .
Additional substitutions associated with a decreased virologic response to etravirine when in the presence of 3 or more additional 2008 IAS - USA defined NNRTI substitutions include A98G , K101H , K103R , V106I , V179T , and Y181C .
The presence of K103N , which was the most prevalent NNRTI substitution in TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 at baseline , did not affect the response in the INTELENCE arm .
Overall , response rates to etravirine decreased as the number of baseline NNRTI substitutions increased ( shown as the proportion of subjects achieving viral load less than 50 plasma HIV RNA copies / mL at Week 48 ) ( Table 10 ) .

Each drug in the background therapy was scored as a ' 1 ' or ' 0 ' based on whether the viral isolate was considered susceptible or resistant to that drug , respectively .
In the calculation of the PSS , darunavir was counted as a sensitive antiretroviral if the FC was less than or equal to 10 ; ENF was counted as a sensitive antiretroviral if it had not been used previously .
INTELENCE was not included in this calculation .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Etravirine was evaluated for carcinogenic potential by oral gavage administration to mice and rats for up to approximately 104 weeks .
Daily doses of 50 , 200 and 400 mg / kg were administered to mice and doses of 70 , 200 and 600 mg / kg were administered to rats in the initial period of approximately 41 to 52 weeks .
The high and middle doses were subsequently adjusted due to tolerability and reduced by 50 % in mice and by 50 to 66 % in rats to allow for completion of the studies .
In the mouse study , statistically significant increases in the incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma and incidences of hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas combined were observed in treated females .
In the rat study , no statistically significant increases in tumor findings were observed in either sex .
The relevance of these liver tumor findings in mice to humans is not known .
Because of tolerability of the formulation in these rodent studies , maximum systemic drug exposures achieved at the doses tested were lower than those in humans at the clinical dose ( 400 mg / day ) , with animal vs . human AUC ratios being 0 . 6 - fold ( mice ) and 0 . 2 - to - 0 . 7 - fold ( rats ) .
Mutagenesis Etravirine tested negative in the in vitro Ames reverse mutation assay , in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocyte , and in vitro clastogenicity mouse lymphoma assay , tested in the absence and presence of a metabolic activation system .
Etravirine did not induce chromosomal damage in the in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Impairment of Fertility No effects on fertility and early embryonic development were observed when etravirine was tested in rats at maternal doses up to 500 mg / day , resulting in systemic drug exposure up to the recommended human dose ( 400 mg / day ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Treatment - Experienced Adult Subjects The clinical efficacy of INTELENCE is derived from the analyses of 48 - week data from 2 ongoing , randomized , double - blinded , placebo - controlled , Phase 3 trials , TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 ( DUET - 1 and DUET - 2 ) in subjects with 1 or more NNRTI resistance - associated substitutions .
These trials are identical in design and the results below are pooled data from the two trials .
TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 are Phase 3 studies designed to evaluate the safety and antiretroviral activity of INTELENCE in combination with a background regimen ( BR ) as compared to placebo in combination with a BR .
Eligible subjects were treatment - experienced HIV - 1 - infected subjects with plasma HIV - 1 RNA greater than 5000 copies / mL while on an antiretroviral regimen for at least 8 weeks .
In addition , subjects had 1 or more NNRTI resistance - associated substitutions at screening or from prior genotypic analysis , and 3 or more of the following primary PI substitutions at screening : D30N , V32I , L33F , M46I / L , I47A / V , G48V , I50L / V , V82A / F / L / S / T , I84V , N88S , or L90M .
Randomization was stratified by the intended use of ENF in the BR , previous use of darunavir / ritonavir , and screening viral load .
Virologic response was defined as HIV - 1 RNA less than 50 copies / mL at Week 48 .
All study subjects received darunavir / ritonavir as part of their BR , and at least 2 other investigator - selected antiretroviral drugs ( N [ t ] RTIs with or without ENF ) .
Of INTELENCE - treated subjects , 25 . 5 % used ENF for the first time ( de novo ) and 20 . 0 % re - used ENF .
Of placebo - treated subjects , 26 . 5 % used de novo ENF and 20 . 4 % re - used ENF .
In the pooled analysis for TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 , demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between the INTELENCE arm and the placebo arm ( Table 13 ) .
Table 13 displays selected demographic and baseline disease characteristics of the subjects in the INTELENCE and placebo arms .

The mean decrease in plasma HIV - 1 RNA from baseline to Week 48 was - 2 . 23 log 10 copies / mL for INTELENCE - treated subjects and - 1 . 46 log 10 copies / mL for placebo - treated subjects .
The mean CD4 + cell count increase from baseline for INTELENCE - treated subjects was 96 cells / mm 3 and 68 cells / mm 3 for placebo - treated subjects .
Of the study population who either re - used or did not use ENF , 57 . 4 % of INTELENCE - treated subjects and 31 . 7 % of placebo - treated subjects achieved HIV - 1 RNA less than 50 copies / mL .
Of the study population using ENF de novo , 67 . 3 % of INTELENCE - treated subjects and 57 . 2 % of placebo - treated subjects achieved HIV - 1 RNA less than 50 copies / mL .
Treatment - emergent CDC category C events occurred in 4 % of INTELENCE - treated subjects and 8 . 4 % of placebo - treated subjects .
Study TMC125 - C227 was a randomized , exploratory , active - controlled , open - label , Phase 2 b trial .
Eligible subjects were treatment - experienced , PI - naïve HIV - 1 - infected subjects with genotypic evidence of NNRTI resistance at screening or from prior genotypic analysis .
The virologic response was evaluated in 116 subjects who were randomized to INTELENCE ( 59 subjects ) or an investigator - selected PI ( 57 subjects ) , each given with 2 investigator - selected N ( t ) RTIs .
INTELENCE - treated subjects had lower antiviral responses associated with reduced susceptibility to the N ( t ) RTIs and to INTELENCE as compared to the control PI - treated subjects .
14 . 2 Treatment - Experienced Pediatric Subjects ( 2 Years to Less Than 18 Years of Age ) The efficacy of INTELENCE for treatment - experienced pediatric subjects is based on two Phase 2 trials , TMC125 - C213 and TMC125 - C234 / IMPAACT P1090 .
