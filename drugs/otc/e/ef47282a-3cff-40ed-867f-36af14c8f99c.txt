Table 5 : Reconstitution Instructions for EMPLICITIStrength Amount of Sterile Water for Injection , USP Required for Reconstitution Deliverable Volume of Reconstituted EMPLICITI in the Vial Postreconstitution Concentration * After reconstitution , each vial contains overfill to allow for withdrawal of 12 mL ( 300 mg ) and 16 mL ( 400 mg ) , respectively .
300 mg vial 13 mL 12 mL * 25 mg / mL 400 mg vial 17 mL 16 mL * 25 mg / mL Reconstitution • • Aseptically reconstitute each EMPLICITI vial with a syringe of adequate size and a less than or equal to 18 - gauge needle ( e . g . , 17 - gauge ) .
A slight back pressure may be experienced during administration of the Sterile Water for Injection , USP , which is considered normal .
• • Hold the vial upright and swirl the solution by rotating the vial to dissolve the lyophilized cake .
Invert the vial a few times in order to dissolve any powder that may be present on top of the vial or the stopper .
Avoid vigorous agitation .
DO NOT SHAKE .
The lyophilized powder should dissolve in less than 10 minutes .
• • After the remaining solids are completely dissolved , allow the reconstituted solution to stand for 5 to 10 minutes .
The reconstituted preparation results in a colorless to slightly yellow , clear to slightly opalescent solution .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
Discard the solution if any particulate matter or discoloration is observed .
Dilution • • Once the reconstitution is completed , withdraw the necessary volume for the calculated dose from each vial , up to a maximum of 16 mL from 400 mg vial and 12 mL from 300 mg vial .
• • Further dilute with either 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP or 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP , into an infusion bag made of polyvinyl chloride or polyolefin .
The final infusion concentration should range between 1 mg / mL and 6 mg / mL .
• • The volume of 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP or 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP should be adjusted so as not to exceed 5 mL / kg of patient weight at any given dose of EMPLICITI .
Complete the EMPLICITI infusion within 24 hours of reconstitution of the EMPLICITI lyophilized powder .
If not used immediately , the infusion solution may be stored under refrigeration conditions : 2 ° C to 8 ° C ( 36 ° F - 46 ° F ) and protected from light for up to 24 hours ( a maximum of 8 hours of the total 24 hours can be at room temperature , 20 ° C to 25 ° C [ 68 ° F - 77 ° F ] , and room light ) .

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of incidence of antibodies to EMPLICITI in the studies described below with the incidences of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading .
Of 390 patients across four clinical studies including ELOQUENT - 2 and in 53 patients in the ELOQUENT - 3 trial , who were treated with EMPLICITI and evaluable for the presence of anti - product antibodies , 72 patients ( 18 . 5 % ) in the four clinical trials and 19 patients ( 36 % ) in the ELOQUENT - 3 trial tested positive for treatment - emergent anti - product antibodies by an electrochemiluminescent ( ECL ) assay .
In 63 ( 88 % ) of the 72 patients in the four clinical trials , anti - product antibodies occurred within the first 2 months of the initiation of EMPLICITI treatment and resolved by 2 to 4 months in 49 ( 78 % ) patients .
In the ELOQUENT - 3 trial , in all 19 patients , anti - product antibodies occurred within the first 2 months of the initiation of EMPLICITI treatment and were resolved by 2 to 3 months in 18 ( 95 % ) patients .
Neutralizing antibodies post - treatment were detected in 19 of 299 patients in the four clinical trials and 2 of 53 patients in the ELOQUENT - 3 trial who were evaluable for the presence of neutralizing antibodies .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Drug Interactions For important drug interactions involving lenalidomide , pomalidomide and dexamethasone , refer to their respective prescribing information .
7 . 2 Laboratory Test Interference EMPLICITI may be detected in the SPEP and serum immunofixation assays of myeloma patients and could interfere with correct response classification .
A small peak in the early gamma region on SPEP that is IgGƙ on serum immunofixation may potentially be attributed to EMPLICITI , particularly in patients whose endogenous myeloma protein is IgA , IgM , IgD , or lambda light chain restricted .
This interference can impact the determination of complete response and possibly relapse from complete response in patients with IgG kappa myeloma protein [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : Embryo - fetal toxicity in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or pomalidomide and dexamethasone .
( 8 . 1 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on EMPLICITI use in pregnant women to inform a drug associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with elotuzumab .
EMPLICITI is administered in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or pomalidomide and dexamethasone .
Lenalidomide and pomalidomide can cause embryo - fetal harm and are contraindicated for use in pregnancy .
Refer to the lenalidomide , pomalidomide and dexamethasone prescribing information for additional information .
Lenalidomide and pomalidomide are only available through a REMS program .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of EMPLICITI in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child from elotuzumab administered in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or pomalidomide and dexamethasone , advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with EMPLICITI .
Refer to the lenalidomide , pomalidomide and dexamethasone prescribing information for additional information .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Refer to the lenalidomide and pomalidomide labeling for pregnancy testing requirements prior to initiating treatment in females of reproductive potential .
When EMPLICITI is used with lenalidomide or pomalidomide , there is a risk of fetal harm , including severe life - threatening human birth defects associated with lenalidomide and pomalidomide , and the need to follow requirements regarding pregnancy avoidance , including testing .
Contraception Females Refer to the lenalidomide and pomalidomide labeling for contraception requirements prior to initiating treatment in females of reproductive potential .
Males Lenalidomide and pomalidomide are present in the blood and semen of patients receiving the drug .

8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 646 patients across treatment groups in the ELOQUENT - 2 randomized trial designed to evaluate the use of EMPLICITI in combination with lenalidomide and low - dose dexamethasone in multiple myeloma , 57 % were 65 years of age or older ; the number of patients 65 years or older was similar between treatment groups .
No overall differences in efficacy or safety were observed between patients 65 years or older and younger patients ( less than 65 years of age ) .
Of the 117 patients across treatment groups in the ELOQUENT - 3 randomized trial designed to evaluate the use of EMPLICITI in combination with pomalidomide and low - dose dexamethasone in multiple myeloma , 62 % were 65 years of age or older ; the number of patients 65 years or older was similar between treatment groups .
This study did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
10 OVERDOSAGE The dose of EMPLICITI at which severe toxicity occurs is not known .
EMPLICITI does not appear to be removed by dialysis as determined in a study of patients with renal impairment .
In case of overdosage , monitor patients closely for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and institute appropriate symptomatic treatment .
11 DESCRIPTION Elotuzumab is a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody directed to SLAMF7 , a cell surface glycoprotein .
Elotuzumab consists of the complementary determining regions ( CDR ) of the mouse antibody , MuLuc63 , grafted onto human IgG1 heavy and kappa light chain frameworks .
Elotuzumab is produced in NS0 cells by recombinant DNA technology .
Elotuzumab has a theoretical mass of 148 . 1 kDa for the intact antibody .
EMPLICITI ( elotuzumab ) is a sterile , nonpyrogenic , preservative - free lyophilized powder that is white to off - white , whole or fragmented cake in single - dose vials .
EMPLICITI for Injection is supplied as 300 mg per vial and 400 mg per vial and requires reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection , USP ( 13 mL and 17 mL , respectively ) to obtain a solution with a concentration of 25 mg / mL .
After reconstitution , each vial contains overfill to allow for withdrawal of 12 mL ( 300 mg ) and 16 mL ( 400 mg ) .
The reconstituted solution is colorless to slightly yellow , clear to slightly opalescent .
Prior to intravenous infusion , the reconstituted solution is diluted with either 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP or 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
Each 300 mg single - dose vial of EMPLICITI also contains the following inactive ingredients : citric acid monohydrate ( 2 . 44 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 3 . 4 mg ) , sodium citrate ( 16 . 6 mg ) , and sucrose ( 510 mg ) .
Each 400 mg single - dose vial of EMPLICITI also contains the following inactive ingredients : citric acid monohydrate ( 3 . 17 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 4 . 4 mg ) , sodium citrate ( 21 . 5 mg ) , and sucrose ( 660 mg ) .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Elotuzumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the SLAMF7 ( Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family member 7 ) protein .
SLAMF7 is expressed on myeloma cells independent of cytogenetic abnormalities .
SLAMF7 is also expressed on Natural Killer ( NK ) cells , plasma cells , and at lower levels on specific immune cell subsets of differentiated cells within the hematopoietic lineage .
Elotuzumab directly activates NK cells through the SLAMF7 pathway .
Elotuzumab also targets SLAMF7 on myeloma cells and interacts with Fc receptors on effector cells to mediate the killing of myeloma cells through antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) and antibody - dependent cellular phagocytosis ( ADCP ) .
In nonclinical models , the combination of elotuzumab and lenalidomide resulted in enhanced activation of NK cells that was greater than the effects of either agent alone and increased anti - tumor activity in vitro and in vivo .
Elotuzumab has also demonstrated increased anti - tumor activity when combined with pomalidomide in vivo .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology EMPLICITI does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent when administered with lenalidomide and dexamethasone at the recommended dose or as monotherapy ( at a dose 2 times the recommended dose ) .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Elotuzumab exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics ( PK ) resulting in greater than proportional increases in area under the concentration - time curve ( AUC ) indicative of target - mediated clearance .
The administration of the recommended 10 mg / kg EMPLICITI regimen with lenalidomide and dexamethasone is predicted to result in geometric mean ( CV % ) steady - state trough concentrations of 194 μg / mL ( 52 % ) .
The administration of the recommended EMPLICITI regimen with pomalidomide and dexamethasone is predicted to result in geometric mean ( CV % ) steady - state trough concentrations of 124 μg / mL ( 59 % ) .
Elimination The clearance of elotuzumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone decreased from a geometric mean ( CV % ) of 17 . 5 ( 21 . 2 % ) to 5 . 8 ( 31 % ) mL / day / kg with an increase in dose from 0 . 5 ( i . e . , 0 . 05 times the recommended dosage ) to 20 mg / kg ( i . e . , 2 times the recommended dosage ) .
When elotuzumab is administered with lenalidomide and dexamethasone , approximately 97 % of the maximum steady - state concentration is predicted to be eliminated with a geometric mean ( CV % ) of 82 . 4 ( 48 % ) days .
When elotuzumab is administered with pomalidomide and dexamethasone , approximately 97 % of the maximum steady - state concentration is predicted to be eliminated with a geometric mean ( CV % ) of 78 ( 42 % ) days .
Specific Populations Clinically significant differences were not observed in the PK of elotuzumab based on age ( 37 to 88 years ) , sex , race , baseline lactate dehydrogenase , albumin , renal impairment ( creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) 15 to 89 mL / min ) , end - stage renal disease ( CLcr < 15 mL / min ) with or without hemodialysis , mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal ( ULN ) and aspartate transaminase ( AST ) > ULN OR total bilirubin 1 to 1 . 5 times the ULN and AST any value ) , and coadministration with lenalidomide / dexamethasone or pomalidomide / dexamethasone .
The PK of elotuzumab in patients with moderate ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 to 3 times the ULN and AST any value ) to severe ( total bilirubin > 3 times the ULN and AST any value ) hepatic impairment is unknown .
The clearance of elotuzumab increased with increasing body weight supporting a weight - based dose .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity or mutagenicity data are available for elotuzumab in animals or humans .
Fertility studies have not been performed for elotuzumab .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES ELOQUENT - 2 ( NCT01239797 ) The efficacy and safety of EMPLICITI in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone were evaluated in ELOQUENT - 2 , a randomized , open - label trial in patients with multiple myeloma who had received one to three prior therapies and had documented progression following their most recent therapy .
Eligible patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive either EMPLICITI in combination with lenalidomide and low - dose dexamethasone or lenalidomide and low - dose dexamethasone .
Treatment was administered in 4 - week cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
