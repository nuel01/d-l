Hypersensitivity reactions to doxorubicin hydrochloride or the components of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection ( 4 , 5 . 2 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hand - Foot Syndrome may occur .
Dose modification or discontinuation may be required ( 5 . 3 ) Embryofetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm .
Advise of potential risk to a fetus .
Use effective contraception ( 5 . 5 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Cardiomyopathy Doxorubicin hydrochloride can result in myocardial damage , including acute left ventricular failure .
The risk of cardiomyopathy with doxorubicin hydrochloride is generally proportional to the cumulative exposure .
Include prior use of other anthracyclines or anthracenediones in calculations of cumulative dose .
The risk of cardiomyopathy may be increased at lower cumulative doses inpatients with prior mediastinal irradiation .
In a clinical study in 250 patients with advanced cancer who were treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection , the risk of cardiomyopathy was 11 % when the cumulative anthracycline dose was between 450 to 550 mg / m 2 .
Cardiomyopathy was defined as > 20 % decrease in resting left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) from baseline where LVEF remained in the normal range or a > 10 % decrease in LVEF from baseline where LVEF was less than the institutional lower limit of normal .
Two percent of patients developed signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure without documented evidence of cardiomyopathy .
Assess left ventricular cardiac function ( e . g . MUGA or echocardiogram ) prior to initiation of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection , during treatment to detect acute changes , and after treatment to detect delayed cardiomyopathy .
Administer doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection to patients with a history of cardiovascular disease only when the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk .
5 . 2 Infusion - Related Reactions Serious , life - threatening , and fatal infusion - related reactions characterized by one or more of the following symptoms can occur with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection : flushing , shortness of breath , facial swelling , headache , chills , chest pain , back pain , tightness in the chest and throat , fever , tachycardia , pruritus , rash , cyanosis , syncope , bronchospasm , asthma , apnea , and hypotension .
Of 239 patients with ovarian cancer treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection in Trial 4 , 7 % of patients experienced acute infusion - related reactions resulting in dose interruption .
All occurred during cycle 1 and none during subsequent cycles .
Across multiple studies of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection monotherapy including this and other studies enrolling 760 patients with various solid tumors , 11 % of patients had infusion - related reactions .
The majority of infusion - related events occurred during the first infusion .
Ensure that medications to treat infusion - related reactions and cardiopulmonary resuscitative equipment are available for immediate use prior to initiation of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection .
Initiate doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection infusions at a rate of 1 mg / min and increase rate as tolerated [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
Withhold doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection for Grade 1 , 2 , or 3 infusion - related actions and resume at a reduced infusion rate .
Discontinue doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection infusion for serious or life - threatening infusion - related reactions .
5 . 3 Hand - Foot Syndrome ( HFS ) In Trial 4 , the incidence of HFS was 51 % of patients in the doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection arm and 0 . 9 % of patients in the topotecan arm , including 24 % Grade 3 or 4 cases of HFS in doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection - treated patients and no Grade 3 or 4 cases in topotecan - treated patients .
HFS or other skin toxicity required discontinuation of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection in 4 . 2 % of patients .
HFS was generally observed after 2 or 3 cycles of treatment but may occur earlier .
Delay doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection for the first episode of Grade 2 or greater HFS [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Discontinue doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection if HFS is severe and debilitating .
5 . 4 Secondary Oral Neoplasms Secondary oral cancers , primarily squamous cell carcinoma , have been reported from post - marketing experience in patients with long - term ( more than one year ) exposure to doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection .
These malignancies were diagnosed both during treatment with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection and up to 6 years after the last dose .
Examine patients at regular intervals for the presence of oral ulceration or with any oral discomfort that may be indicative of secondary oral cancer .
The altered pharmacokinetics and preferential tissue distribution of liposomal doxorubicin that contributes to enhanced skin toxicity and mucositis compared to free doxorubicin may play a role in the development of oral secondary malignancies with long - term use .
5 . 5 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action , doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman ; avoid the use of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection during the 1 st trimester .
Available human data do not establish the presence or absence of major birth defects and miscarriage related to the use of doxorubicin hydrochloride during the 2 nd and 3 rd trimesters .
At doses approximately 0 . 12 times the recommended clinical dose , doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection was embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for 6 months after treatment with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) and ( 8 . 3 ) ] .

However , the background risk in the U . S . general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 to 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
Data Animal Data Doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection was embryotoxic at doses of 1 mg / kg / day in rats and was embryotoxic and abortifacient at 0 . 5 mg / kg / day in rabbits ( both doses are about 0 . 12 times the recommended dose of 50 mg / m 2 human dose on a mg / m 2 basis ) .
Embryotoxicity was characterized by increased embryo - fetal deaths and reduced live litter sizes .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection is present in human milk .
Because many drugs , including anthracyclines , are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection , discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection .
Contraception Females Doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for 6 months after treatment with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection .
Males Doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection may damage spermatozoa and testicular tissue , resulting in possible genetic fetal abnormalities .
Males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during and for 6 months after treatment with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection [ see Non - clinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Females In females of reproductive potential , doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection may cause infertility and result in amenorrhea .
Premature menopause can occur with doxorubicin hydrochloride .
Recovery of menses and ovulation is related to age at treatment .
Males Doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection may result in oligospermia , azoospermia , and permanent loss of fertility .
Sperm counts have been reported to return to normal levels in some men .
This may occur several years after the end of therapy [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection conducted in patients with either epithelial ovarian cancer ( Trial 4 ) or with AIDS - related Kaposi ’ s sarcoma ( Trial 5 ) did not contain sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In Trial 6 , of 318 patients treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection in combination with bortezomib for multiple myeloma , 37 % were 65 years of age or older and 8 % were 75 years of age or older .
No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these patients and younger patients .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection has not been adequately evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment .
Doxorubicin is eliminated in large part by the liver .
Reduce doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection for serum bilirubin of 1 . 2 mg / dL or higher .
10 OVERDOSAGE Acute overdosage with doxorubicin hydrochloride causes increased risk of severe mucositis , leukopenia , and thrombocytopenia .
11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection is doxorubicin hydrochloride , USP , an anthracycline topoisomerase inhibitor , that is encapsulated in PEGYLATED liposomes for intravenous use .
The chemical name of doxorubicin hydrochloride , USP is ( 8 S , 10 S ) - 10 - [ ( 3 - amino - 2 , 3 , 6 - trideoxy - α - L - lyxo - hexopyranosyl ) oxy ] - 8 - glycolyl - 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 - tetrahydro - 6 , 8 , 11 - trihydroxy - 1 - methoxy - 5 , 12 - naphthacenedione hydrochloride .
The molecular formula is C 27 - H 29 - NO 11 • HCl ; its molecular weight is 579 . 99 .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection is a sterile , translucent , red liposomal dispersion .
Each vial contains 20 mg or 50 mg doxorubicin hydrochloride , USP at a concentration of 2 mg / mL ( equivalent to 1 . 87 mg / mL of doxorubicin ) and a pH of 6 . 5 .
The PEGYLATED liposome carriers are composed of cholesterol , 3 . 19 mg / mL ; fully hydrogenated soy phosphatidylcholine ( HSPC ) , 9 . 58 mg / mL ; and N - ( carbonyl - methoxypolyethylene glycol 2000 ) - 1 , 2 - distearoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine sodium salt ( MPEG - DSPE ) , 3 . 19 mg / mL .
Each mL also contains ammonium sulfate , approximately 0 . 6 mg ; histidine as a buffer ; hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide for pH control ; and sucrose to maintain isotonicity .
Greater than 90 % of the drug is encapsulated in the PEGYLATED liposomes .
MPEG - DSPE has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] n = ca . 45 HSPC has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] m , n = 14 or 16 Representation of a PEGYLATED liposome : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The active ingredient of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection is doxorubicin hydrochloride .
The mechanism of action of doxorubicin hydrochloride is thought to be related to its ability to bind DNA and inhibit nucleic acid synthesis .
Cell structure studies have demonstrated rapid cell penetration and perinuclear chromatin binding , rapid inhibition of mitotic activity and nucleic acid synthesis , and induction of mutagenesis and chromosomal aberrations .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic parameters for total doxorubicin following a single dose of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection infused over 30 minutes are presented in Table 8 .
Table 8 : Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Total Doxorubicin from Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome Injection in Patients With AIDS - Related Kaposi ’ s Sarcoma Dose Parameter ( units ) 10 mg / m 2 20 mg / m 2 Peak Plasma Concentration ( mcg / mL ) 4 . 12 ± 0 . 215 8 . 34 ± 0 . 49 Plasma Clearance ( L / h / m 2 ) 0 . 056 ± 0 . 01 0 . 041 ± 0 . 004 Steady State Volume of Distribution ( L / m 2 ) 2 . 83 ± 0 . 145 2 . 72 ± 0 . 120 AUC ( mcg / mL • h ) 277 ± 32 . 9 590 ± 58 . 7 First Phase ( λ 1 ) Half - Life ( h ) 4 . 7 ± 1 . 1 5 . 2 ± 1 . 4 Second Phase ( λ 1 ) Half - Life ( h ) 52 . 3 ± 5 . 6 55 ± 4 . 8 N = 23 Mean ± Standard Error Doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection displayed linear pharmacokinetics over the range of 10 to 20 mg / m 2 .
Relative to doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection doses at or below 20 mg / m 2 , the pharmacokinetics of total doxorubicin following a 50 mg / m 2 doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection dose are nonlinear .
At this dose , the elimination half - life of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection is longer and the clearance lower compared to a 20 mg / m 2 dose .
Distribution : Direct measurement of liposomal doxorubicin shows that at least 90 % of the drug ( the assay used cannot quantify less than 5 to 10 % free doxorubicin ) remains liposome - encapsulated during circulation .
In contrast to doxorubicin , which displays a large volume of distribution ( range 700 to 1100 L / m 2 ) , the small steady state volume of distribution of liposomal doxorubicin suggests that doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection is largely confined to vascular fluid .
Doxorubicin becomes available after the liposomes are extravasated .
Plasma protein binding of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection has not been determined ; the plasma protein binding of doxorubicin is approximately 70 % .
Metabolism : Doxorubicinol , the major metabolite of doxorubicin , was detected at concentrations of 0 . 8 to 26 . 2 ng / mL in the plasma of patients who received 10 or 20 mg / m 2 doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection .
Elimination : The plasma clearance of total doxorubicin from doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection was 0 . 041 L / h / m 2 at a dose of 20 mg / m 2 .
Following administration of doxorubicin , the plasma clearance of doxorubicin is 24 to 35 L / h / m 2 .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment Of Fertility Mutagenicity or carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection , however doxorubicin was shown to be mutagenic in the in vitro Ames assay , and clastogenic in multiple in vitro assays ( CHO cell , V79 hamster cell , human lymphoblast , and SCE assays ) and the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
The possible adverse effects on fertility in animals have not been adequately evaluated .
Doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection resulted in mild to moderate ovarian and testicular atrophy in mice after administration of a single dose of 36 mg / kg ( about 2 times the 50 mg / m 2 human dose on a mg / m 2 basis ) .
Decreased testicular weights and hypospermia were observed in rats after repeat doses ≥ 0 . 25 mg / kg / day ( about 0 . 03 times the 50 mg / m 2 human dose on a mg / m 2 basis ) , and diffuse degeneration of the seminiferous tubules and a marked decrease in spermatogenesis were observed in dogs after repeat doses of 1 mg / kg / day ( about 0 . 4 times the 50 mg / m 2 human dose on a mg / m 2 basis ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Ovarian Cancer Doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection was studied in three open - label , single - arm , clinical studies of 176 patients with metastatic ovarian cancer ( Trials 1 , 2 , and 3 ) .
One hundred forty - five of these patients were refractory to both paclitaxel - and platinum - based chemotherapy regimens , defined as disease progression while on treatment or relapse within 6 months of completing treatment .
Patients received doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection at 50 mg / m 2 every 3 or 4 weeks for 3 to 6 + cycles in the absence of dose - limiting toxicity or disease progression .
The median age at diagnosis ranged from 52 to 64 years in the 3 studies , and the range was 22 to 85 .
Most patients had International Federation of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( FIGO ) stage III or IV disease ( ranging from 83 % to 93 % ) .
Approximately one third of the patients had three or more prior lines of therapy ( ranging from 22 % to 33 % ) .
The primary outcome measure was confirmed response rate based on Southwestern Oncology Group ( SWOG ) criteria for patients refractory to both paclitaxel - and a platinum - containing regimen .
Secondary efficacy parameters were time to response , duration of response , and time to progression .
The response rates for the individual single arm trials are given in Table 9 below .
Table 9 : Response Rates in Patients With Refractory Ovarian Cancer From Single Arm Ovarian Cancer Trials Trial 1 ( U . S . ) N = 27 Trial 2 ( U . S . ) N = 82 Trial 3 ( non - U . S . ) N = 36 Response Rate 22 . 2 % 17 . 1 % 0 % 95 % Confidence Interval 8 . 6 % - 42 . 3 % 9 . 7 % - 27 % 0 % - 9 . 7 % In a pooled analysis of Trials 1 to 3 , the response rate for all patients refractory to paclitaxel and platinum agents was 13 . 8 % ( 95 % CI 8 . 1 % to 19 . 3 % ) .
The median time to progression was 15 . 9 weeks , the median time to response was 17 . 6 weeks , and the duration of response was 39 . 4 weeks .
In Trial 4 , a randomized , multicenter , open - label , trial in 474 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer after platinum - based chemotherapy , patients were randomized to receive either doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection 50 mg / m 2 every 4 weeks ( n = 239 ) or topotecan 1 . 5 mg / m 2 daily for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks ( n = 235 ) .
Patients were stratified according to platinum sensitivity ( response to initial platinum - based therapy and a progression - free interval of greater than 6 months off treatment ) and the presence of bulky disease ( tumor mass greater than 5 cm in size ) .
The primary outcome measure was time to progression ( TTP ) .
Other endpoints included overall survival and objective response rate .
Of the 474 patients , the median age at diagnosis was 60 years ( range 25 to 87 ) , 90 % were FIGO stage III and IV ; 46 % were platinum sensitive ; and 45 % had bulky disease .
There was no statistically significant difference in TTP between the two arms .
Results are provided in Table 10 .

14 . 2 AIDS - Related Kaposi ’ s Sarcoma Doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection was studied in an open - label , single - arm , multicenter study at a dose of 20 mg / m 2 every 3 weeks , until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity ( Trial 5 ) .
Data is described for a cohort of 77 patients retrospectively identified as having disease progression on prior systemic combination chemotherapy ( at least two cycles of a regimen containing at least two of three treatments : bleomycin , vincristine or vinblastine , or doxorubicin ) or as being intolerant to such therapy .
Forty - nine of the 77 ( 64 % ) patients had received prior doxorubicin hydrochloride .
The median time on study was 5 . 1 months ( range 1 day to 15 months ) .
The median cumulative dose of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection was 154 mg / m 2 ( range 20 to 620 mg / m 2 ) .
Among the 77 patients , mean age was 38 years ( range 24 to 54 ) ; 87 % were Caucasian , 5 % Hispanic , 4 % Black , and 4 % Asian / Other / Unknown ; median CD4 count was 10 cells / mm 3 ; ACTG staging criteria were 78 % poor risk for tumor burden , 96 % poor risk for immune system , and 58 % poor risk for systemic illness at baseline ; and mean Karnofsky status score was 74 % .
All patients had cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions , 40 % also had oral lesions , 26 % pulmonary lesions , and 14 % had lesions of the stomach / intestine .
Two analyses of tumor response were used : one based on investigator assessment of changes in lesions based on modified ACTG criteria ( partial response defined as no new lesions , sites of disease , or worsening edema ; flattening of ≥ 50 % of previously raised lesions or area of indicator lesions decreasing by ≥ 50 % ; and response lasting at least 21 days with no prior progression ) , and one based on changes in up to five prospectively indentified representative indicator lesions ( partial response defined as flattening of ≥ 50 % of previously raised indicator lesions , or > 50 % decrease in the area of indicator lesions and lasting at least 21 days with no prior progression ) .
Of the 77 patients , 34 were evaluable for investigator assessment and 42 were evaluable for indicator lesion assessment ; analyses of tumor responses are shown in Table 11 .

2 There were no complete responses in this population .
Retrospective efficacy analyses were performed in two trials that had subsets of patients who received single - agent doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection and who were on stable antiretroviral therapy for at least 60 days prior to enrollment and until a response was demonstrated .
In one trial , 7 of 17 ( 40 % ) patients had a durable response ( median duration not reached but was longer than 11 . 6 months ) .
In the second trial , 4 of 11 patients ( 40 % ) on a stable antiretroviral therapy demonstrated durable responses .
14 . 3 Multiple Myeloma The efficacy of doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection in combination with bortezomib was evaluated in Trial 6 , a randomized , open - label , international , multicenter study in 646 patients who had not previously received bortezomib and whose disease progressed during or after at least one prior therapy .
Patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to receive either doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection ( 30 mg / m 2 ) administered IV on day 4 following bortezomib ( 1 . 3 mg / m 2 IV on days 1 , 4 , 8 and 11 ) or bortezomib alone every 3 weeks for up to 8 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Patients who maintained a response were allowed to receive further treatment .
The median number of cycles in each treatment arm was 5 ( range 1 to 18 ) .
The baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of the patients with multiple myeloma were similar between treatment arms ( Table 12 ) .
