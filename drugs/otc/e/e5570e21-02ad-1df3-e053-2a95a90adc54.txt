Advise patients to seek medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of infection .
( 5 . 3 ) • The presence of a sulfite in this product should not deter use .
( 5 . 4 ) • Administer with caution in patients with heart disease ; may aggravate angina pectoris or produce ventricular arrhythmias .
( 5 . 5 ) 5 . 1 Emergency Treatment EpiPen and EpiPen Jr are intended for immediate administration as emergency supportive therapy and are not intended as a substitute for immediate medical care .
In conjunction with the administration of epinephrine , the patient should seek immediate medical or hospital care .
More than two sequential doses of epinephrine should only be administered under direct medical supervision [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) , Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 2 Injection - Related Complications EpiPen and EpiPen Jr should only be injected into the anterolateral aspect of the thigh [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
Do not inject intravenously Large doses or accidental intravenous injection of epinephrine may result in cerebral hemorrhage due to sharp rise in blood pressure .
Rapidly acting vasodilators can counteract the marked pressor effects of epinephrine if there is such inadvertent administration .
Do not inject into buttock Injection into the buttock may not provide effective treatment of anaphylaxis .
Advise the patient to go immediately to the nearest emergency room for further treatment of anaphylaxis .
Additionally , injection into the buttock has been associated with Clostridial infections ( gas gangrene ) .
Cleansing with alcohol does not kill bacterial spores , and therefore , does not lower this risk .
Do not inject into digits , hands or feet Since epinephrine is a strong vasoconstrictor , accidental injection into the digits , hands or feet may result in loss of blood flow to the affected area .
Advise the patient to go immediately to the nearest emergency room and to inform the healthcare provider in the emergency room of the location of the accidental injection .
Treatment of such inadvertent administration should consist of vasodilation , in addition to further appropriate treatment of anaphylaxis [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Hold leg firmly during injection Lacerations , bent needles , and embedded needles have been reported when EpiPen and EpiPen Jr have been injected into the thigh of young children who are uncooperative and kick or move during an injection .
To minimize the risk of injection related injury when administering , hold the child ’ s leg firmly in place and limit movement prior to and during injection .
5 . 3 Serious Infections at the Injection Site Rare cases of serious skin and soft tissue infections , including necrotizing fasciitis and myonecrosis caused by Clostridia ( gas gangrene ) , have been reported at the injection site following epinephrine injection for anaphylaxis .
Clostridium spores can be present on the skin and introduced into the deep tissue with subcutaneous or intramuscular injection .
While cleansing with alcohol may reduce presence of bacteria on the skin , alcohol cleansing does not kill Clostridium spores .
To decrease the risk of Clostridium infection , do not inject EpiPen into the buttock [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Advise patients to seek medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of infection , such as persistent redness , warmth , swelling , or tenderness , at the epinephrine injection site .
5 . 4 Allergic Reactions Associated with Sulfite The presence of a sulfite in this product should not deter administration of the drug for treatment of serious allergic or other emergency situations even if the patient is sulfite - sensitive .
Epinephrine is the preferred treatment for serious allergic reactions or other emergency situations even though this product contains sodium metabisulfite , a sulfite that may , in other products , cause allergic - type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms or life - threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible persons .
The alternatives to using epinephrine in a life - threatening situation may not be satisfactory .
5 . 5 Disease Interactions Some patients may be at greater risk for developing adverse reactions after epinephrine administration .
Despite these concerns , it should be recognized that the presence of these conditions is not a contraindication to epinephrine administration in an acute , life - threatening situation .
Therefore , patients with these conditions , and / or any other person who might be in a position to administer EpiPen or EpiPen Jr to a patient experiencing anaphylaxis should be carefully instructed in regard to the circumstances under which epinephrine should be used .
Patients with Heart Disease Epinephrine should be administered with caution to patients who have heart disease , including patients with cardiac arrhythmias , coronary artery or organic heart disease , or hypertension .
In such patients , or in patients who are on drugs that may sensitize the heart to arrhythmias , epinephrine may precipitate or aggravate angina pectoris as well as produce ventricular arrhythmias [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Other Patients and Diseases Epinephrine should be administered with caution to patients with hyperthyroidism , diabetes , elderly individuals , and pregnant women .
Patients with Parkinson ’ s disease may notice a temporary worsening of symptoms .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Due to the lack of randomized , controlled clinical trials of epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis , the true incidence of adverse reactions associated with the systemic use of epinephrine is difficult to determine .
Adverse reactions reported in observational trials , case reports , and studies are listed below .
Common adverse reactions to systemically administered epinephrine include anxiety ; apprehensiveness ; restlessness ; tremor ; weakness ; dizziness ; sweating ; palpitations ; pallor ; nausea and vomiting ; headache ; and / or respiratory difficulties .

( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Elderly patients may be at greater risk of developing adverse reactions .
( 5 . 5 , 8 . 5 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well controlled studies of the acute effect of epinephrine in pregnant women .
In animal reproductive studies , epinephrine administered by the subcutaneous route to rabbits , mice , and hamsters during the period of organogenesis was teratogenic at doses 7 times and higher than the maximum recommended human intramuscular and subcutaneous dose on a mg / m 2 basis .
Epinephrine is the first - line medication of choice for the treatment of anaphylaxis during pregnancy in humans .
Epinephrine should be used for treatment of anaphylaxis during pregnancy in the same manner as it is used in non - pregnant patients .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and embryo / fetal risk During pregnancy , anaphylaxis can be catastrophic and can lead to hypoxic - ischemic encephalopathy and permanent central nervous system damage or death in the mother and , more commonly , in the fetus or neonate .
The prevalence of anaphylaxis occurring during pregnancy is reported to be approximately 3 cases per 100 , 000 deliveries .
Management of anaphylaxis during pregnancy is similar to management in the general population .
Epinephrine is the first line - medication of choice for treatment of anaphylaxis ; it should be used in the same manner in pregnant and non - pregnant patients .
In conjunction with the administration of epinephrine , the patient should seek immediate medical or hospital care .
Data Animal Data In an embryofetal development study with rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis , epinephrine was shown to be teratogenic ( including gastroschisis and embryonic lethality ) at doses approximately 40 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose ( on a mg / m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 1 . 2 mg / kg / day for two to three days ) .
In an embryofetal development study with mice dosed during the period of organogenesis , epinephrine was shown to be teratogenic ( including embryonic lethality ) at doses approximately 8 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose ( on a mg / m 2 basis at maternal subcutaneous dose of 1 mg / kg / day for 10 days ) .
These effects were not seen in mice at approximately 4 times the maximum recommended daily intramuscular or subcutaneous dose ( on a mg / m 2 basis at a subcutaneous maternal dose of 0 . 5 mg / kg / day for 10 days ) .
In an embryofetal development study with hamsters dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 10 , epinephrine was shown to be teratogenic at doses approximately 7 times the maximum recommended intramuscular or subcutaneous dose ( on a mg / m 2 basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 0 . 5 mg / kg / day ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of epinephrine in human milk , the effects on breastfed infants , or the effects on milk production .
Epinephrine is the first line - medication of choice for treatment of anaphylaxis ; it should be used in the same manner in breastfeeding and non - breastfeeding patients .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use EpiPen or EpiPen Jr may be administered to pediatric patients at a dosage appropriate to body weight [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Clinical experience with the use of epinephrine suggests that the adverse reactions seen in children are similar in nature and extent to those both expected and reported in adults .
Since the doses of epinephrine delivered from EpiPen and EpiPen Jr are fixed , consider using other forms of injectable epinephrine if doses lower than 0 . 15 mg are deemed necessary .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies for the treatment of anaphylaxis have not been performed in subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
However , other reported clinical experience with use of epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis has identified that geriatric patients may be particularly sensitive to the effects of epinephrine .
Therefore , EpiPen should be administered with caution in elderly individuals , who may be at greater risk for developing adverse reactions after epinephrine administration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) , Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage of epinephrine may produce extremely elevated arterial pressure , which may result in cerebrovascular hemorrhage , particularly in elderly patients .
Overdosage may also result in pulmonary edema because of peripheral vascular constriction together with cardiac stimulation .
Treatment consists of rapidly acting vasodilators or alpha - adrenergic blocking drugs and / or respiratory support .
Epinephrine overdosage can also cause transient bradycardia followed by tachycardia , and these may be accompanied by potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias .
Premature ventricular contractions may appear within one minute after injection and may be followed by multifocal ventricular tachycardia ( prefibrillation rhythm ) .
Subsidence of the ventricular effects may be followed by atrial tachycardia and occasionally by atrioventricular block .
Treatment of arrhythmias consists of administration of a beta - adrenergic blocking drug such as propranolol .
Overdosage sometimes results in extreme pallor and coldness of the skin , metabolic acidosis , and kidney failure .
Suitable corrective measures must be taken in such situations .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Epinephrine acts on both alpha - and beta - adrenergic receptors .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Through its action on alpha - adrenergic receptors , epinephrine lessens the vasodilation and increased vascular permeability that occurs during anaphylaxis , which can lead to loss of intravascular fluid volume and hypotension .
Through its action on beta - adrenergic receptors , epinephrine causes bronchial smooth muscle relaxation and helps alleviate bronchospasm , wheezing and dyspnea that may occur during anaphylaxis .
Epinephrine also alleviates pruritus , urticaria , and angioedema and may relieve gastrointestinal and genitourinary symptoms associated with anaphylaxis because of its relaxer effects on the smooth muscle of the stomach , intestine , uterus and urinary bladder .
When given subcutaneously or intramuscularly , epinephrine has a rapid onset and short duration of action .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of epinephrine have not been conducted .
Epinephrine and other catecholamines have been shown to have mutagenic potential in vitro .
Epinephrine was positive in the Salmonella bacterial reverse mutation assay , positive in the mouse lymphoma assay , and negative in the in vivo micronucleus assay .
Epinephrine is an oxidative mutagen based on the E . coli WP2 Mutoxitest bacterial reverse mutation assay .
This should not prevent the use of epinephrine where indicated [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
The potential for epinephrine to impair reproductive performance has not been evaluated , but epinephrine has been shown to decrease implantation in female rabbits dosed subcutaneously with 1 . 2 mg / kg / day ( 40 - fold the highest human intramuscular or subcutaneous daily dose ) during gestation days 3 to 9 .
