( 5 . 4 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Immune - Mediated Adverse Reactions IMFINZI is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death - receptor 1 ( PD - 1 ) or the PD - ligand 1 ( PD - L1 ) , blocking the PD - 1 / PD - L1 pathway , thereby removing inhibition of the immune response , potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune - mediated adverse reactions .
Important immune - mediated adverse reactions listed under Warnings and Precautions may not include all possible severe and fatal immune - mediated reactions .
The incidence and severity of immune - mediated adverse reactions were similar when IMFINZI was administered as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy or in combination with tremelimumab - actl and platinum - based chemotherapy , unless otherwise noted .
Immune - mediated adverse reactions , which may be severe or fatal , can occur in any organ system or tissue .
Immune - mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting treatment with a PD 1 / PD L1 blocking antibody .
While immune - mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment with PD - 1 / PD - L1 blocking antibodies , immune - mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of PD - 1 / PD - L1 blocking antibodies .
Early identification and management of immune - mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of PD - 1 / PD - L1 blocking antibodies .
Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune - mediated adverse reactions .
Evaluate liver enzymes , creatinine , and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment .
In cases of suspected immune - mediated adverse reactions , initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies , including infection .
Institute medical management promptly , including specialty consultation as appropriate .
Withhold or permanently discontinue IMFINZI depending on severity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
In general , if IMFINZI requires interruption or discontinuation , administer systemic corticosteroid therapy ( 1 mg to 2 mg / kg / day prednisone or equivalent ) until improvement to Grade 1 or less .
Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less , initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month .
Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune - mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action , IMFINZI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data on the use of IMFINZI in pregnant women .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of durvalumab to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys from the confirmation of pregnancy through delivery at exposure levels approximately 6 to 20 times higher than those observed at the clinical dose of 10 mg / kg based on area under the curve ( AUC ) , resulted in an increase in premature delivery , fetal loss , and premature neonatal death ( see Data ) .
Human immunoglobulin G1 ( IgG1 ) is known to cross the placental barrier ; therefore , durvalumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus .
Apprise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data As reported in the literature , the PD - 1 / PD - L1 pathway plays a central role in preserving pregnancy by maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the fetus .
In mouse allogeneic pregnancy models , disruption of PD - L1 signaling was shown to result in an increase in fetal loss .
The effects of durvalumab on prenatal and postnatal development were evaluated in reproduction studies in cynomolgus monkeys .
Durvalumab was administered from the confirmation of pregnancy through delivery at exposure levels approximately 6 to 20 times higher than those observed at the clinical dose of 10 mg / kg ( based on AUC ) .
Administration of durvalumab resulted in premature delivery , fetal loss ( abortion and stillbirth ) , and increase in neonatal deaths .
Durvalumab was detected in infant serum on postpartum Day 1 , indicating the presence of placental transfer of durvalumab .
Based on its mechanism of action , fetal exposure to durvalumab may increase the risk of developing immune - mediated disorders or altering the normal immune response and immune - mediated disorders have been reported in PD - 1 knockout mice .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of durvalumab in human milk , its effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk .
The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure in the breastfed child to IMFINZI are unknown .
Durvalumab was present in the milk of lactating cynomolgus monkeys and was associated with premature neonatal death ( see Data ) .
Because of the potential for adverse reactions in a breastfed child , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with IMFINZI and for 3 months after the last dose .
Refer to the Prescribing Information for the agents administered in combination with IMFINZI for recommended duration to not breastfeed , as appropriate .
Data In lactating cynomolgus monkeys , durvalumab was present in breast milk at about 0 . 15 % of maternal serum concentrations after administration of durvalumab from the confirmation of pregnancy through delivery at exposure levels approximately 6 to 20 times higher than those observed at the recommended clinical dose of 10 mg / kg ( based on AUC ) .
Administration of durvalumab resulted in premature neonatal death .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy testing Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with IMFINZI .
Contraception Females IMFINZI can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IMFINZI and for 3 months following the last dose of IMFINZI .
Refer to the Prescribing Information for the agents administered in combination with IMFINZI for recommended contraception duration , as appropriate .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of IMFINZI have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 476 patients treated with IMFINZI in the PACIFIC study , 45 % were 65 years or older , while 7 . 6 % were 75 years or older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years or older and younger patients .
The PACIFIC study did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 75 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
Of the 265 patients with ES - SCLC treated with IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy 101 ( 38 % ) patients were 65 years or older and 19 ( 7 . 2 % ) patients were 75 years or older .
There were no clinically meaningful differences in safety or efficacy between patients 65 years or older and younger patients .
Of the 330 patients with metastatic NSCLC treated with IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab - actl and platinum - based chemotherapy , 143 ( 43 % ) patients were 65 years or older and 35 ( 11 % ) patients were 75 years or older .
There were no clinically meaningful differences in safety or efficacy between patients 65 years or older and younger patients .
Of the 338 patients with BTC treated with IMFINZI in combination with chemotherapy in the TOPAZ - 1 study , 158 ( 47 % ) patients were 65 years or older and 38 ( 11 % ) patients were 75 years or older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of IMFINZI have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients .
Of the 393 patients with uHCC treated with IMFINZI in combination with tremelimumab - actl , 50 % of patients were 65 years of age or older and 13 % of patients were 75 years of age or older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of IMFINZI have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients ..
11 DESCRIPTION Durvalumab is a programmed cell death ligand 1 ( PD - L1 ) blocking antibody .
Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa ( IgG1κ ) monoclonal antibody that is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cell suspension culture .
IMFINZI ( durvalumab ) Injection for intravenous use is a sterile , preservative - free , clear to opalescent , colorless to slightly yellow solution , free from visible particles .
Each 500 mg vial of IMFINZI contains 500 mg of durvalumab in 10 mL solution .
Each mL contains durvalumab , 50 mg , L - histidine ( 2 mg ) , L - histidine hydrochloride monohydrate ( 2 . 7 mg ) , α , α - trehalose dihydrate ( 104 mg ) , Polysorbate 80 ( 0 . 2 mg ) , and Water for Injection , USP .
Each 120 mg vial of IMFINZI contains 120 mg of durvalumab in 2 . 4 mL solution .
Each mL contains durvalumab , 50 mg , L - histidine ( 2 mg ) , L - histidine hydrochloride monohydrate ( 2 . 7 mg ) , α , α - trehalose dihydrate ( 104 mg ) , Polysorbate 80 ( 0 . 2 mg ) , and Water for Injection , USP .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Expression of programmed cell death ligand - 1 ( PD - L1 ) can be induced by inflammatory signals ( e . g . , IFN - gamma ) and can be expressed on both tumor cells and tumor - associated immune cells in the tumor microenvironment .
PD - L1 blocks T - cell function and activation through interaction with PD - 1 and CD80 ( B7 . 1 ) .
By binding to its receptors , PD - L1 reduces cytotoxic T - cell activity , proliferation , and cytokine production .
Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa ( IgG1κ ) monoclonal antibody that binds to PD L1 and blocks the interaction of PD - L1 with PD - 1 and CD80 ( B7 . 1 ) .
Blockade of PD - L1 / PD - 1 and PD L1 / CD80 interactions releases the inhibition of immune responses , without inducing antibody dependent cell - mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) .
PD - L1 blockade with durvalumab led to increased T - cell activation in vitro and decreased tumor size in co - engrafted human tumor and immune cell xenograft mouse models .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The steady state AUC , Ctrough , and Cmax in patients administered with 1 , 500 mg every 4 weeks are 6 % higher , 19 % lower , and 55 % higher than those administered with 10 mg / kg every 2 weeks , respectively .
Based on the modeling of pharmacokinetic data and exposure relationships for safety , there are no anticipated clinically meaningful differences in efficacy and safety for the doses of 1 , 500 mg every 4 weeks compared to 10 mg / kg every 2 weeks in patients weighing > 30 kg with NSCLC .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of durvalumab as a single agent was studied in patients with doses ranging from 0 . 1 mg / kg ( 0 . 01 times the approved recommended dosage ) to 20 mg / kg ( 2 times the approved recommended dosage ) administered once every two , three , or four weeks .
PK exposure increased more than dose - proportionally at doses < 3 mg / kg ( 0 . 3 times the approved recommended dosage ) and dose proportionally at doses ≥ 3 mg / kg every 2 weeks .
Steady state was achieved at approximately 16 weeks .
The pharmacokinetics of durvalumab is similar when assessed as a single agent , when in combination with chemotherapy , when in combination with tremelimumab - actl and when in combination with tremelimumab - actl and platinum - based chemotherapy .
Distribution The geometric mean ( % coefficient of variation [ CV % ] ) steady state volume of distribution ( Vss ) was 5 . 4 ( 13 . 1 % ) L . Elimination Durvalumab clearance decreases over time , with a mean maximal reduction ( CV % ) from baseline values of approximately 23 % ( 57 % ) resulting in a geometric mean ( CV % ) steady state clearance ( CLss ) of 8 mL / h ( 39 % ) at day 365 ; the decrease in CLss is not considered clinically relevant .
The geometric mean ( CV % ) terminal half - life , based on baseline CL was approximately 21 ( 26 % ) days .
Specific Populations There were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of durvalumab based on body weight ( 31 to 175 kg ) , age ( 18 to 96 years ) , sex , race ( White , Black , Asian , Native Hawaiian , Pacific Islander , or Native American ) , albumin levels ( 4 to 57 g / L ) , lactate dehydrogenase levels ( 18 to 15 , 800 U / L ) , soluble PD - L1 ( 67 to 3 , 470 pg / mL ) , tumor type ( NSCLC , SCLC , BTC and HCC ) , mild or moderate renal impairment ( CLcr 30 to 89 mL / min ) , and mild or moderate hepatic impairment ( bilirubin ≤ 3 x ULN and any AST ) .
The effect of severe renal impairment ( CLcr 15 to 29 mL / min ) or severe hepatic impairment ( bilirubin > 3 x ULN and any AST ) on the pharmacokinetics of durvalumab is unknown .
12 . 6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti - drug antibodies ( ADA ) is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparison of the incidence of ADAs in the studies described below with the incidence of ADAs in other studies including those of IMFINZI .
Of the 2 , 280 patients who received IMFINZI 10 mg / kg every 2 weeks or 20 mg / kg every 4 weeks as a single - agent , 69 patients ( 3 % ) tested positive for ADAs and 12 ( 0 . 5 % ) tested positive for neutralizing antibodies .
The development of ADAs against durvalumab appears to have no clinically relevant effect on its pharmacokinetics or safety .
Of the 201 patients in the CASPIAN study who received IMFINZI 1 , 500 mg every 3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy for four doses followed by IMFINZI 1 , 500 mg every 4 weeks , no patients tested positive for ADAs .
Of the 240 patients in the TOPAZ - 1 study who received IMFINZI 1 , 500 mg every 3 weeks in combination with chemotherapy up to 8 cycles followed by IMFINZI 1 , 500 mg every 4 weeks , 2 ( 0 . 8 % ) patients tested positive for treatment emergent ADAs and neutralizing antibodies , respectively .
There were insufficient numbers of patients with ADAs or neutralizing antibodies ( 2 patients each ) to determine whether ADAs have an impact on pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics , safety and / or effectiveness of IMFINZI .
During the 12 week treatment period in the HIMALAYA study , of the 294 patients who received IMFINZI once every 4 weeks in combination with a single dose of tremelimumab - actl and who were evaluated for the presence of ADAs against IMFINZI at predose week 0 , week 4 and week 12 , 3 . 1 % ( 9 / 294 ) of patients tested positive for anti - durvalumab - antibodies .
Among the 9 patients who tested positive for ADA , 55 . 6 % ( 5 / 9 ) tested positive for neutralizing antibodies against durvalumab .
There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti - durvalumab antibodies on the safety of durvalumab ; however , the effect of ADAs on the pharmacokinetics and effectiveness of durvalumab is unknown .
During 16 weeks of treatment during the POSEIDON study , among 286 patients who received IMFINZI 1 , 500 mg in combination with tremelimumab - actl 75 mg every 3 weeks for five doses and chemotherapy for four cycles followed by IMFINZI 1 , 500 mg every 4 weeks 10 % ( 29 / 286 ) of patients tested positive for anti - durvalumab antibodies with predose sampling at week 0 , week 3 and week 12 .
Among the 29 patients who tested positive for ADAs , 10 % ( 3 / 29 ) tested positive for neutralizing antibodies against durvalumab .
The geometric mean of durvalumab concentration in patients with ADA positive was 46 mcg / mL compared to 89 mcg / mL in patients with ADA negative .
There was no clinically significant effect of anti - durvalumab antibodies on the safety of durvalumab ; however , there is insufficient data to assess whether the observed ADA associated pharmacokinetic changes reduce effectiveness of durvalumab .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic and genotoxic potential of durvalumab have not been evaluated .
Animal fertility studies have not been conducted with durvalumab .
In repeat - dose toxicology studies with durvalumab in sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys of up to 3 months duration , there were no notable effects on the male and female reproductive organs .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology In animal models , inhibition of PD - L1 / PD - 1 signaling increased the severity of some infections and enhanced inflammatory responses .
Mycobacterium tuberculosis - infected PD - 1 knockout mice exhibit markedly decreased survival compared with wild - type controls , which correlated with increased bacterial proliferation and inflammatory responses in these animals .

14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Non - Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) Unresectable Stage III NSCLC - PACIFIC The efficacy of IMFINZI was evaluated in the PACIFIC study ( NCT02125461 ) , a multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study in patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC who completed at least 2 cycles of concurrent platinum - based chemotherapy and definitive radiation within 42 days prior to initiation of the study drug and had a WHO performance status of 0 or 1 .
The study excluded patients who had progressed following concurrent chemoradiation , patients with active or prior documented autoimmune disease within 2 years of initiation of the study or patients with medical conditions that required systemic immunosuppression .
Randomization was stratified by sex , age ( < 65 years vs . ≥ 65 years ) , and smoking history ( smoker vs . non - smoker ) .
Patients were randomized 2 : 1 to receive IMFINZI 10 mg / kg or placebo intravenously every 2 weeks for up to 12 months or until unacceptable toxicity or confirmed RECIST v1 . 1 - defined progression .
Assessment of tumor status was performed every 8 weeks .
The major efficacy outcome measures were progression - free survival ( PFS ) as assessed by a BICR RECIST v1 . 1 , and overall survival ( OS ) .
Additional efficacy outcome measures included ORR and DoR assessed by BICR .
A total of 713 patients were randomized : 476 patients to the IMFINZI arm and 237 to the placebo arm .
The study population characteristics were : median age of 64 years ( range : 23 to 90 ) ; 70 % male ; 69 % White and 27 % Asian ; 16 % current smokers , 75 % former smokers , and 9 % never smokers ; 51 % WHO performance status of 1 ; 53 % with Stage IIIA and 45 % were Stage IIIB ; 46 % with squamous and 54 % with non - squamous histology .
All patients received definitive radiotherapy as per protocol , of which 92 % received a total radiation dose of 54 Gy to 66 Gy ; 99 % of patients received concomitant platinum - based chemotherapy ( 55 % cisplatin - based , 42 % carboplatin - based chemotherapy , and 2 % switched between cisplatin and carboplatin ) .
At a pre - specified interim analysis for OS based on 299 events ( 61 % of total planned events ) , the study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS in patients randomized to IMFINZI compared to placebo .
The pre - specified interim analysis of PFS based on 371 events ( 81 % of total planned events ) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS in patients randomized to IMFINZI compared to placebo .
