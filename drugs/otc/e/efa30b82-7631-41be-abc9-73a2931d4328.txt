External Radiation The specific gamma ray constant for fluorine F 18 is 6 . 0 R / hr / mCi ( 0 . 3 Gy / hr / kB ) at 1 cm .
The half - value layer ( HVL ) for the 511 keV photons is 4 . 1 mm lead ( Pb ) .
A range of values for the attenuation of radiation results from the interposition of various thickness of Pb .
The range of attenuation coefficients for this radionuclide is shown in Table 2 .
For example , the interposition of an 8 . 3 mm thickness of Pb , with a coefficient of attenuation of 0 . 25 , will decrease the external radiation by 75 % .

Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is transported through the cell membrane by facilitative glucose transporter proteins and is phosphorylated within the cell to [ 18 F ] FDG - 6 - phosphate by the enzyme hexokinase .
Once phosphorylated it cannot exit until it is dephosphorylated by glucose - 6 - phosphatase .
Therefore , within a given tissue or pathophysiological process , the retention and clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect a balance involving glucose transporter , hexokinase and glucose - 6 - phosphatase activities .
When allowance is made for the kinetic differences between glucose and Fludeoxyglucose F 18 transport and phosphorylation ( expressed as the “ lumped constant ” ratio ) , Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is used to assess glucose metabolism .
In comparison to background activity of the specific organ or tissue type , regions of decreased or absent uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect the decrease or absence of glucose metabolism .
Regions of increased uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 reflect greater than normal rates of glucose metabolism .
Pharmacodynamics Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection is rapidly distributed to all organs of the body after intravenous administration .
After background clearance of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection , optimal PET imaging is generally achieved between 30 to 40 minutes after administration .
In cancer , the cells are generally characterized by enhanced glucose metabolism partially due to ( 1 ) an increase in the activity of glucose transporters , ( 2 ) an increased rate of phosphorylation activity , ( 3 ) a reduction of phosphatase activity or , ( 4 ) a dynamic alteration in the balance among all these processes .
However , glucose metabolism of cancer as reflected by Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation shows considerable variability .
Depending on tumor type , stage , and location , Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation may be increased , normal , or decreased .
Also , inflammatory cells can have the same variability of uptake of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 .
In the heart , under normal aerobic conditions , the myocardium meets the bulk of its energy requirements by oxidizing free fatty acids .
Most of the exogenous glucose taken up by the myocyte is converted into glycogen .
However , under ischemic conditions , the oxidation of free fatty acids stimulated , and glucose taken up by the myocyte is metabolized immediately instead of being converted into glycogen .
Under these conditions , phosphorylated Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulates in the myocyte and can be detected with PET imaging .
Normally , the brain relies on anaerobic metabolism .
In epilepsy , the glucose metabolism varies .
Generally , during a seizure , glucose metabolism increases .
Interictally , the seizure focus tends to be hypometabolic .
Pharmacokinetics In four healthy male volunteers , receiving an intravenous administration of 30 seconds in duration , the arterial blood level profile for Fludeoxyglucose F 18 was described as a triexponential decay curve .
The effective half - life ranges of the three phases were 0 . 2 - 0 . 3 minutes , 10 - 13 minutes with a mean and standard deviation ( STD ) of 11 . 6 ± 1 . 1 min , and 80 - 95 minutes with a mean and STD of 88 ±□ 4 min .
Plasma Protein Binding The extent of binding of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 to plasma proteins is not known .
Metabolism Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is transported into cells and phosphorylated to [ 18 F ] - FDG - 6 - phosphate at a rate proportional to the rate of glucose utilization within that tissue .
[ 18 F ] - FDG - 6 - phosphate presumably is metabolized to 2 - deoxy - 2 - [ 18 F ] fluoro - 6 - phospho - D - mannose ( [ 18 F ] FDM - 6 - phosphate ) .
Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection may contain several impurities ( e . g . , 2 - deoxy - 2 - chloro - D - glucose ( ClDG ) ) .
Biodistribution and metabolism of C1DG are presumed to be similar to Fludeoxyglucose F 18 and would be expected to result in intracellular formation of 2 - deoxy - 2 - chloro - 6 - phospho - D - glucose ( C1DG - 6 - phosphate ) and 2 - deoxy - 2 - chloro - 6 - phospho - D - mannose ( ClDM - 6 - phosphate ) .
The phosphorylated deoxyglucose compounds are dephosphorylated and the resulting compounds ( FDG , FDM , C1DG , and ClDM ) presumably leave cells by passive diffusion .
Fludeoxyglucose F 18 and related compounds are cleared from non - cardiac tissues within 3 to 24 hours after administration .
Clearance from the cardiac tissue may require more than 96 hours .
Fludeoxyglucose F 18 that is not involved in glucose metabolism in any tissue is then excreted in the urine .
Excretion Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is cleared from most tissues within 24 hours and can be eliminated from the body unchanged in the urine .
Three elimination phases have been identified in the reviewed literature .
Within 33 minutes , a mean of 3 . 9 % of the administrated radioactive dose was measured in the urine .
The amount of radiation exposure of the urinary bladder at two hours post - administration suggests that 20 . 6 % ( mean ) of the radioactive dose was present in the bladder .
Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations Extensive dose range and dose adjustment studies with this drug product in normal and special populations have not been completed .
In pediatric patients with epilepsy , doses given have been as low as 2 . 6 mCi .
The pharmacokinetics of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection in renally - impaired patients have not been characterized .
Fludeoxyglucose F 18 is eliminated through the renal system .
Care should be taken to prevent excessive and unnecessary radiation exposure to this organ system and adjacent tissues .
The effects of fasting , varying blood sugar levels , conditions of glucose intolerance , and diabetes mellitus on Fludeoxyglucose F 18 distribution in humans have not been ascertained .
Diabetic patients may need stabilization of blood glucose levels on the day before and on the day of the Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection study .
Drug - Drug Interactions Drug - drug interactions with Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection have not been evaluated .
CLINICAL TRIALS Oncology : 1 The efficacy of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection in positron emission tomography cancer imaging was demonstrated in 16 independent literature reports .
These studies prospectively evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 for detecting malignancies .
All these studies had at least 50 patients and used pathology as a standard of truth to compare the results of PET imaging with Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection .
The studies encompassed a variety of cancers : non - small cell lung cancer , colo - rectal , pancreatic , breast , thyroid , melanoma , Hodgkin ’ s and non - Hodgkin ’ s lymphoma , and various types of metastatic cancers to lung , liver , bone , and axillary nodes .
The doses in the studies ranged from 200 MBq to 740 MBq with a median and mean dose of 370 MBq .
In these studies the patients had a clinical reason for the evaluation of malignancy ( e . g . , the patients had an abnormality identified by a prior test and were seeking a diagnosis , or the patients had an existing diagnosis of cancer and were having further work - up or monitoring ) .
None of these studies evaluated the use of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection in routine population screening in which healthy , asymptomatic people are tested for purposes of cancer early detection .
The efficacy of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET imaging in cancer screening , including its ability to decrease cause - specific mortality , is unknown .
In PET imaging with Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection , sensitivity is restricted by the biologic variability of cancer glucose utilization found in individual patients , with different cancers ( see Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacodynamic sections ) .
In the reviewed studies , the sensitivity and specificity varied with the type of cancer , size of cancer , and other clinical parameters .
Also , there were false negatives and false positives .
Negative PET imaging results with Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection do not preclude the diagnosis of cancer and further work - up is indicated .
Also , positive PET imaging results with Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection cannot replace biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of cancer .
There are non - malignant conditions such as fungal infections , inflammatory processes , and benign tumors that had patterns of increased glucose metabolism that give rise to false - positive examinations .
Cardiology : 2 The efficacy of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection for cardiac use was demonstrated in ten independent literature reports , which , in general , shared the characteristics summarized below .
The studies were prospective and enrolled patients with coronary artery disease and chronic left ventricular systolic dysfunction of a mild to moderate degree .
The patients were scheduled to undergo coronary revascularization with either coronary artery bypass surgery or angioplasty .
Before revascularization , patients underwent PET imaging with Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection and perfusion imaging with other diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals .
Doses of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection ranged from 74 - 370 MBq ( 2 - 10 mCi ) .
Segmental , left ventricular , wall - motion assessments of asynergic areas made before revascularization were compared to those made after successful revascularization to identify myocardial segments with functional recovery .
Segmental wall motion assessments were made blinded to the results of metabolic / perfusion imaging , and PET image analyses were quantitative .
Left ventricular myocardial segments were predicted to have reversible loss of systolic function if they showed Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation and reduced perfusion ( i . e . , flow - metabolism mismatch ) .
Conversely , myocardial segments were predicted to have irreversible loss of systolic function if they showed concordant reductions in both Fludeoxyglucose F 18 accumulation and perfusion ( i . e . , matched defects ) .
Diagnostic performance measures such as sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , and negative predictive value were calculated .
None of the studies prospectively determined the degree to which mismatch , or the location of mismatch , is associated with improvements in global ventricular function , clinical symptoms , exercise tolerance , or survival .
Findings of flow - metabolism mismatch in a myocardial segment suggest that successful revascularization will restore myocardial function in that segment .
However , false - positive tests occur regularly , and the decision to have a patient undergo revascularization should not be based on PET findings alone .
Similarly , findings of a matched defect in a myocardial segment suggest that myocardial function will not recover in that segment , even if it is successfully revascularized .
However , false - negative tests occur regularly , and the decision to recommend against coronary revascularization , or to recommend a cardiac transplant , should not be based on PET findings alone .
The reversibility of segmental dysfunction as predicted with Fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET imaging depends on successful coronary revascularization .
Therefore , in patients with a low likelihood of successful revascularization , the diagnostic usefulness of PET imaging with Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection is limited .
Epilepsy : 3 In a prospective , open label trial , Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection was evaluated in 86 patients with epilepsy .
Each patient received a dose of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection in the range of 185 - 370 MBq ( 5 - 10 mCi ) .
Demographic characteristics of race and gender are not available .
The mean age was 16 . 4 years ( range : 4 months - 58 years ; of these , 42 patients were < 12 years and 16 patients were < 2 years old ) .
Patients had a known diagnosis of complex partial epilepsy and were under evaluation as surgical candidates for treatment of their seizure disorder .
Seizure foci had been previously identified on ictal EEGs and sphenoidal EEGs .
In 16 % ( 14 / 87 ) of patients , the pre - Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection findings were confirmed by Fludeoxyglucose F 18 ; 34 % ( 30 / 87 ) of patients , images of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection provided new findings .
In 32 % ( 27 / 87 ) , imaging with Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection was not definitive .
The influence of these findings on surgical outcome , medical management , or behavior is not known .
Several other studies comparing imaging with Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection results to subsphenoidal EEG , MRI and / or surgical findings supported the concept that the degree of hypometabolism corresponds to areas of confirmed epileptogenic foci .
The safety and effectiveness of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection to distinguish idiopathic epileptogenic foci from tumors or other brain lesions that may cause seizures have not been established .

To help protect themselves and others in their environment , patients should take the following precautions for 12 hours after injection : whenever possible , a toilet should be used and should be flushed several times after each use and hands should be washed thoroughly after each voiding or fecal elimination .
If blood , urine or feces soil clothing , the clothing should be washed separately .
Diabetic Patients Transport of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 into cells may be affected by fasting or by blood glucose changes associated with diabetes mellitus .
Diabetic patients may need stabilization of blood glucose levels on the day before and on the day of administration of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment or Fertility Studies with Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , mutagenic potential or effects on fertility .
Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection .
It is not known whether Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .

ADVERSE REACTIONS The Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection safety database for epilepsy included of 374 patients .
Of these , 245 were male and 105 were female .
For 24 patients , gender was not specified .
The mean age was 47 . 8 years ( range under 2 to over 65 years ) .
Eighteen patients were between the age of 0 and 2 years ; 42 patients were between the ages of 2 and 21 years ; 213 patients were between 21 and 65 years ; 98 patients were older than 65 years ; and the ages of 3 male patients were not specified .
A racial distribution is not available .
In this database , adverse drug reactions that required medical intervention were not reported .
In a small , 42 patient subset of the 374 patients studied , 4 patients had transient hypotension , 6 had hypo - or hyperglycemia and 3 had transient increases in alkaline phosphatase .
Reviews of the oncology and cardiology literature did not reveal reported adverse reactions .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection for an adult ( 70 kg ) is 185 - 370 MBq ( 5 - 10 mCi ) , as an intravenous injection for studies of malignancy , cardiology , and epilepsy .
In general , Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection should be administered after patients have fasted for 4 - 6 hours .
For cardiac use , Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection may be administered either to patients who have fasted or to patients who have received a glucose load ( See Patient Preparation section ) .
The optimum rates of administration and upper safe dose for Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection have not been established .
The time interval between doses of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection should be long enough to allow substantial decay ( physical and biological ) of previous administrations .
The final dose for the patient should be calculated using proper decay factors from the time of the end of synthesis ( EOS ) , and measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration system before administration .
See decay factors in Table 3 .
Patient Preparation : Blood glucose levels should be stabilized before Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection is administered .
In non - diabetic patients this may be accomplished by fasting 4 - 6 hours before Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection .
Diabetic patients may need stabilization of blood glucose on the day preceding and on the day of administration of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection .
For cardiac imaging , administration of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection to fasting patients limits the accumulation of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 to ischemic myocardium .
This may make localization of the ischemic region difficult because the surrounding myocardium will not be well visualized .
Conversely , administration of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection to patients who have received a glucose load ( e . g . , 50 - 75 grams , 1 - 2 hours before administration of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection ) allows the surrounding , non - ischemic myocardium to be seen and facilitates localization of ischemic areas .
Imaging : Optimally , it is recommended that positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging be initiated within 40 minutes of administration of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection .
Static emission scans are acquired 30 - 100 minutes from time of injection .
OVERDOSAGE Overdoses of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection have not been reported .
See Radiation Dosimetry section for related information .
DRUG HANDLING Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection , USP , like other parenteral drugs , should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration before administration , whenever solution and container permit .
Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection preparations containing particulate matter or discoloration should not be administered .
They should be disposed of in a safe manner , in compliance with applicable regulations .

RADIATION DOSIMETRY The estimated human absorbed radiation doses ( rem / mCi ) to a 1 - year old ( 9 . 8 kg ) , 5 - year old ( 19 kg ) , 10 - year old ( 32 kg ) , 15 - year old ( 57 kg ) , and adult ( 70 kg ) from intravenous administration of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection are shown in Table 4 .
These estimates were calculated based on human4 data and using the data published by the International Commission on Radiological Protection5 for Fludeoxyglucose F 18 .
The dosimetry data obtained and presented in this table show that there are slight variations in absorbed radiation dose for various organs in each of the age groups .
These dissimilarities in absorbed radiation dose are understood to be due to developmental age variations ( e . g . , organ size , location , and overall metabolic rate for each age group ) .
The identified critical organs ( in descending order ) across all age groups evaluated ( i . e . , newborn , 1 , 5 , 10 , 15 year ( s ) and adults ) are the urinary bladder , heart , pancreas , spleen , and lungs .
The absolute values for absorbed radiation in each of these organs vary in each of the age groups .
