Drugs that inhibit or induce CYP3A may alter the plasma concentrations of ibrexafungerp and affect the safety and efficacy of BREXAFEMME [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] Table 3 Effect of Coadministered Drugs on Ibrexafungerp Pharmacokinetics : Concomitant Drugs Effect on Ibrexafungerp Concentration Recommendation Strong CYP3A inhibitors : ( e . g . , ketoconazole , itraconazole ) Significantly increased Reduce the BREXAFEMME dosage [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] Strong and Moderate CYP3A inducers : ( e . g . , rifampin , carbamazepine , phenytoin , St . John ’ s wort , long acting barbiturates , bosentan , efavirenz , or etravirine ) Not studied in vivo or in vitro , but likely to result in significant reduction Avoid concomitant administration Ibrexafungerp is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 , P - gp and OATP1B3 transporter [ ( see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
However , given the short treatment duration for VVC , the effect of BREXAFEMME on the pharmacokinetics of substrates of CYP3A4 , P - gp and OATP1B3 transporters is not considered to be clinically significant .
• Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors increases the exposure of ibrexafungerp .
Reduce BREXAFEMME dose with concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor to 150 mg twice daily for one day .
( 2 . 2 , 7 ) • Concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inducers may significantly reduce the exposure of ibrexafungerp .
Avoid concomitant administration of BREXAFEMME with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers .
( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies , BREXAFEMME use is contraindicated in pregnancy because it may cause fetal harm .
In pregnant rabbits , oral ibrexafungerp administered during organogenesis was associated with rare malformations including absent forelimb ( s ) , absent hindpaw , absent ear pinna , and thoracogastroschisis at dose exposures greater or equal to approximately 5 times the human exposure at the RHD .
Oral ibrexafungerp administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis was not associated with fetal toxicity or increased fetal malformations at a dose exposure approximately 5 times the human exposure at the RHD ( see Data ) .
Available data on BREXAFEMME use in pregnant women are insufficient to draw conclusions about any drug - associated risks of major birth defects , miscarriage , or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
There is a pregnancy safety study for BREXAFEMME .
If BREXAFEMME is inadvertently administered during pregnancy or if pregnancy is detected within 4 days after a patient receives BREXAFEMME , pregnant women exposed to BREXAFEMME and healthcare providers should report pregnancies to SCYNEXIS , Inc . at 1 - 888 - 982 - SCYX ( 7299 ) .
Data Animal Data In a rat embryo - fetal study , ibrexafungerp was administered to pregnant rats by oral gavage from gestation days ( GDs ) 6 through 17 at doses of 10 , 20 , 35 , and 50 mg / kg / day .
No fetal malformations or changes in embryo - fetal survival or fetal body weights occurred with any of the doses of ibrexafungerp up to the high - dose of 50 mg / kg / day ( approximately 5 times the RHD based on plasma AUC comparison ) .
In an embryo - fetal study in rabbits , ibrexafungerp was administered by oral gavage at doses of 10 , 25 , and 50 mg / kg / day from GD 7 through GD 19 .
In the mid - dose group administered 25 mg / kg / day ( approximately 5 times the RHD based on AUC comparison ) , fetal malformations , including absent ear pinna , craniorachischisis , thoracogastroschisis , trunk kyphosis , absent forelimbs , absent forepaws , and absent hindpaw occurred in a single fetus .
Malformations including absent hindpaw and anencephaly occurred with an increased litter incidence in the high - dose group of 50 mg / kg / day ( approximately 13 times the RHD based on AUC comparison ) , and other malformations occurred in single fetuses and litters including absent ear pinna , thoracogastroschisis , absent forelimb , and absent thyroid gland .
No changes in embryo - fetal survival or fetal body weights were observed with any of the ibrexafungerp doses , and fetal malformations were not observed with the 10 mg / kg / day dose of ibrexafungerp ( approximately 2 times the RHD based on AUC comparison ) .
In a pre - postnatal study in rats , ibrexafungerp was administered by oral gavage from GD 6 through the lactation period until lactation day 20 in maternal doses of 10 , 20 , 35 , and 50 mg / kg / day .
No maternal toxicity or adverse effects on the survival , growth , behavior , or reproduction of first - generation offspring occurred with any of the ibrexafungerp doses up to the high dose of 50 mg / kg / day ( approximately 5 times the RHD based on AUC comparison ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ibrexafungerp in either human or animal milk , the effects on the breast - fed infant , or the effects on milk production .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Ibrexafungerp is a triterpenoid antifungal drug [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Ibrexafungerp exposure - response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic response are unknown .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At a concentration of 5 times or greater than that achieved after a single day 300 mg twice daily dose , ibrexafungerp does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy subjects , ibrexafungerp area under the curve ( AUC ) and maximal concentration ( C max ) increased approximately dose - proportionally following single dose administration from 10 to 1600 mg ( 0 . 02 to 2 . 67 times the approved recommended daily dose ) and multiple - dose administration from 300 - 800 mg ( 0 . 50 to 1 . 33 times the approved recommended daily dose ) .
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients with VVC , the model predicts that 300 mg twice a day for 2 doses achieves a mean ( % CV ) AUC 0 - 24 exposure of 6832 ( 15 % ) ng • hr / mL and C max of 435 ( 15 % ) ng / mL under fasted conditions and a mean AUC 0 - 24 exposure of 9867 ( 15 % ) ng • h / mL and C max of 629 ( 15 % ) ng / mL under fed conditions .
Absorption After oral administration of BREXAFEMME in healthy volunteers , ibrexafungerp generally reaches maximum plasma concentrations 4 to 6 hours after single and multiple dosing .
Effect of Food Following administration of BREXAFEMME to healthy volunteers , the ibrexafungerp C max increased 32 % and the AUC increased 38 % with a high fat meal ( 800 - 1000 calories ; 50 % fat ) , compared to fasted conditions .
This exposure change is not considered clinically significant [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Distribution The mean steady state volume of distribution ( Vss ) of ibrexafungerp is approximately 600 L . Ibrexafungerp is highly protein bound ( greater than 99 % ) , predominantly to albumin .
Animal studies demonstrate a 9 - fold higher exposure in vaginal tissue than in blood .
Elimination Ibrexafungerp is eliminated mainly via metabolism and biliary excretion .
The elimination half - life is approximately 20 hours .
Metabolism In vitro studies show that ibrexafungerp undergoes hydroxylation by CYP3A4 , followed by glucuronidation and sulfation of a hydroxylated inactive metabolite .
Excretion Following oral administration of radio - labeled ibrexafungerp to healthy volunteers , a mean of 90 % of the radioactive dose ( 51 % as unchanged ibrexafungerp ) was recovered in feces and 1 % was recovered in urine .
SpecificPopulations Post - Menarchal Pediatric Females and Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of ibrexafungerp were not altered in post - menarchal pediatric females ( ages 13 to 17 years ) or in geriatric patients ( ages 65 to 76 years ) .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of ibrexafungerp were not altered in subjects with mild ( Child - Pugh Class A ) to moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B ) hepatic impairment when the total AUC estimates were compared to healthy subjects .
The impact of severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) on the pharmacokinetics of ibrexafungerp is unknown .

Effect of Coadministered Drugs on Ibrexafungerp Pharmacokinetics StrongCYP3A4 Inhibitor : Ketoconazole ( 400 mg once daily for 15 days ) , a strong CYP3A4 and P - gp inhibitor , increased the ibrexafungerp AUC by 5 . 8 - fold and C max by 2 . 5 - fold [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitor : Diltiazem ( 240 mg once daily for 15 days ) increased the ibrexafungerp AUC by 2 . 5 - fold and C max by 2 . 2 - fold .
This exposure change is not considered clinically significant at the approved recommended dosage for VVC .
Proton Pump Inhibitor : Pantoprazole ( 40 mg once daily for 5 days ) decreased ibrexafungerp AUC by approximately 25 % and C max by 22 % .
This exposure change is not considered clinically significant at the approved recommended dosage for VVC .
Effect of Ibrexafungerp on the Pharmacokinetics of Coadministered Drugs The effects of ibrexafungerp on substrates of CYP2C8 , CYP3A4 , P - gp , and OATP1B3 transporters were evaluated in studies that included loading doses of ibrexafungerp of 1250 to 1500 mg ( 2 . 1 to 2 . 5 times the approved recommended daily dose ) for two days followed by 750 mg ( 1 . 25 times the approved recommended daily dose ) once daily for 3 - 7 days .
CYP2C8 substrates : Ibrexafungerp did not increase the AUC 0 - inf or C max of rosiglitazone , a moderate sensitive CYP2C8 substrate .
CYP3A4 substrates : Ibrexafungerp resulted in 1 . 4 - fold increase in the AUC 0 - inf and no effect on the C max of the sensitive CYP3A4 and P - gp substrate tacrolimus .
P - gp substrates : Ibrexafungerp resulted in a 1 . 4 - fold increase in the AUC 0 - 48 and a 1 . 25 - fold increase in the C max of the P - gp substrate dabigatran .
OATP1B3 transporters : Ibrexafungerp resulted in a 2 . 8 - fold increase in the AUC 0 - 24 and a 3 . 5 fold increase in the C max of the OATP1B3 transporter substrate pravastatin .

13 . 2 Animal Toxicity and / or Pharmacology Daily administration of oral ibrexafungerp for 26 weeks in rats , at the highest dose of 80 mg / kg / day ( approximately 10 times the RHD based on AUC comparison ) , was associated with marked , but reversible , phospholipidosis and foamy histiocytes in alveolar tissue in the lung and labored breathing , marked irritation and metaplasia in gastric mucosa , and peripheral nerve degeneration accompanied by hind - limb paralysis .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Treatment of VVC Two randomized placebo - controlled clinical trials ( Trial 1 , NCT03734991 and Trial 2 , NCT03987620 ) with a similar design were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single day of BREXAFEMME 600 mg ( two 150 mg tablets per dose , administered 12 hours apart ) for the treatment of VVC .
Non - pregnant post - menarchal females with a diagnosis of VVC were eligible .
A diagnosis of VVC was defined as ( a ) minimum composite vulvovaginal signs and symptoms ( VSS ) score of ≥ 4 with at least two signs or symptoms having a score of 2 ( moderate ) or greater ; ( b ) positive microscopic examination with 10 % KOH in a vaginal sample revealing yeast forms ( hyphae / pseudohyphae ) or budding yeasts , and ( c ) normal vaginal pH ( ≤ 4 . 5 ) .
The total composite VSS score was based on the vulvovaginal signs ( erythema , edema , excoriation ) and vulvovaginal symptoms ( itching , burning , or irritation ) where each was scored as 0 = absent , 1 = mild , 2 = moderate , or 3 = severe .
Study visits included the test of cure ( TOC , Day 8 to 14 ) visit and a follow - up ( Day 21 to 29 ) visit .
The modified intent to treat ( MITT ) population included randomized subjects with a baseline culture positive for Candida species who took at least 1 dose of study medication .
Trial 1 was conducted in the United States .
The MITT population consisted of 190 patients treated with BREXAFEMME and 100 patients treated with placebo .
The average age was 34 years ( range 17 - 67 years ) , with 91 % less than 50 years .
Fifty - four percent ( 54 % ) were White and 40 % were Black or African American , 26 % were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity .
The average BMI was 30 and 9 % had a history of diabetes .
The median VSS score at baseline was 9 ( range 4 - 18 ) .
The majority ( 92 % ) of the subjects were culture - positive with C . albicans .
Trial 2 was conducted in the United States ( 39 % ) and Bulgaria ( 61 % ) .
The MITT population consisted of 189 patients treated with BREXAFEMME and 89 patients treated with placebo .
The average age was 34 years ( range 18 - 65 years ) , with 92 % less than 50 years .
Eighty - one percent ( 81 % ) were White and 19 % were Black or African American , 10 % were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity .
The average BMI was 26 and 5 % had a history of diabetes .
The median VSS score at baseline was 10 ( range 4 - 18 ) .
The majority ( 89 % ) of the subjects were culture - positive with C . albicans .
Efficacy was assessed by clinical outcome at the TOC visit .
A complete clinical response was defined as the complete resolution of signs and symptoms ( VSS score of 0 ) .
Additional endpoints included a negative culture for Candida spp .
at the TOC visit , and clinical outcome at the follow - up visit .
Statistically significantly greater percentages of patients experienced a complete clinical response at TOC , negative culture at TOC , and complete clinical response at follow - up with treatment with BREXAFEMME compared to placebo .
The results for the clinical and mycological responses are presented in Table 4 .

14 . 2 Reduction in the Incidence of RVVC A randomized placebo - controlled clinical trial ( Trial 3 , NCT04029116 ) was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BREXAFEMME 300 mg ( two 150 mg tablets ) administered approximately 12 hours apart ( e . g . , in the morning and in the evening ) for one day , for a total daily dosage of 600 mg ( four 150 mg tablets ) administered once monthly for six months .
Trial 3 was conducted in the United States ( 33 % ) , Bulgaria ( 28 % ) , Poland ( 12 % ) , and Russia ( 28 % ) .
Non - pregnant post - menarchal females presenting with a symptomatic VVC episode and a history of recurrent VVC ( at least 3 episodes of VVC in the previous 12 months ) were eligible .
The symptomatic episode at Screening was treated with 3 doses of fluconazole 150 mg 3 days apart .
To be randomized , patients had to have a culture - confirmed VVC episode at Screening and had to achieve significant resolution of their vulvovaginal signs and symptoms ( defined as a total composite score ≤ 2 on the VSS Scale ) after fluconazole treatment .
Patients were randomized at a 1 : 1 ratio to receive double - blind BREXAFEMME or placebo administered as a single - day treatment repeated every 4 weeks for a total of 6 single - day treatments .
Study visits included the test of cure ( TOC ) at Week 24 ( 4 weeks after the last dose ) and a follow - up visit at Week 36 .
The intent to treat ( ITT ) population was all randomized patients .
The ITT population consisted of 130 patients treated with BREXAFEMME and 130 patients treated with placebo .
The average age was 34 years ( range 18 - 65 years ) with 95 % less than 50 years .
Ninety percent ( 90 % ) of patients were White , 8 % were Black or African American , and 2 % were Asian and other race .
Eight percent ( 8 % ) of patients were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity .
The average BMI of the patient population was 25 and 16 . 5 % were obese ( BMI > 30 ) .
Efficacy was assessed as the percentage of patients with Clinical Success , defined as subjects with No Culture Proven , Presumed or Suspected Recurrence of VVC requiring antifungal therapy up to TOC at Week 24 .
Clinical success was also assessed at the Week 36 Follow - up visit .
Statistically significantly greater percentages of patients experienced Clinical Success at TOC compared to placebo .
The clinical success rate at TOC was lower for patients in the United States when compared to patients outside the United States ( ex - US ) for both BREXAFEMME and placebo groups .
In both regions , the BREXAFEMME group had a higher clinical success rate compared to placebo ( US : 33 % vs 23 % and ex - US : 81 % vs 68 % in BREXAFEMME vs placebo arms , respectively ) and the difference between the treatment groups was consistent [ US : 10 . 1 % ( - 9 . 0 , 29 . 1 ) and ex - US : 12 . 9 % ( 0 . 04 , 25 . 7 ) ] .
Clinical Success at Week 36 was also greater for BREXAFEMME compared to placebo .
The results for clinical success and reasons for clinical failure are presented in Table 5 .
