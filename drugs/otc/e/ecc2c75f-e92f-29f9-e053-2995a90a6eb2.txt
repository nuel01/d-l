Clinical Pharmacology Sodium Fluoride acts systemically ( before tooth eruption ) and topically ( post eruption ) by increasing tooth resistance to acid dissolution , by promoting remineralization and by inhibiting the cariogenic microbial process .
Indications and Usage As a supplemental source of Fluoride .
It has been established that ingestion of fluoridated drinking water ( 1 ppm F ) during the period of tooth development results in significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries . 1 Sodium Fluoride Drops were developed to provide systemic Fluoride for use as a supplement in pediatric patients from 6 months to age 3 and older , living in areas where the drinking water Fluoride level does not exceed 0 . 6 ppm F . Contraindications Do not use in areas where drinking water exceeds 0 . 6 ppm F . Do not administer to pediatric patients less than 6 months old .
Warnings Prolonged daily ingestion of quantities greater than the recommended amount may result in various degrees of dental fluorosis in pediatric patients under age 6 years , especially if the water fluoridation exceeds 0 . 6 ppm .
Read directions carefully before using .
Keep out of the reach of infants and children .
Precautions See " Overdosage " section .
Incompatibility of Fluoride with dairy foods has been reported due to formation of Calcium Fluoride which is poorly absorbed .
