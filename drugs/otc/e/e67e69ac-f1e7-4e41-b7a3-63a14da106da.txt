Inactives : sodium chloride , sodium acetate , sodium hydroxide and / or hydrochloric acid ( pH 4 . 4 - 7 . 8 ) , purified water and benzalkonium chloride 0 . 01 % ( preservative ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Apraclonidine hydrochloride is a relatively selective alpha - 2 - adrenergic agonist .
When instilled in the eye , apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % , has the action of reducing elevated , as well as normal , intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , whether or not accompanied by glaucoma .
Ophthalmic apraclonidine has minimal effect on cardiovascular parameters .
Elevated IOP presents a major risk factor in glaucomatous field loss .
The higher the level of IOP , the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss .
Apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % has the action of reducing IOP .
The onset of action of apraclonidine can usually be noted within one hour , and maximum IOP reduction occurs about three hours after instillation .
Aqueous fluorophotometry studies demonstrate that apraclonidine ' s predominant mechanism of action is reduction of aqueous flow via stimulation of the alpha - adrenergic system .
Repeated dose - response and comparative studies ( 0 . 125 % - 1 . 0 % apraclonidine ) demonstrate that 0 . 5 % apraclonidine is at the top of the dose - response IOP reduction curve .
The clinical utility of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % is most apparent for those glaucoma patients on maximally tolerated medical therapy .
Patients on maximally tolerated medical therapy with uncontrolled IOP , and scheduled to undergo laser trabeculoplasty or trabeculectomy surgery were enrolled into a double - masked , placebo - controlled , multicenter clinical trial to determine if apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % , dosed three times daily , could delay the need for surgery for up to three months .
All patients enrolled into this trial had advanced glaucoma and were undergoing maximally tolerated medical therapy , i . e . , patients were using combinations of a topical beta blocker , sympathomimetics , parasympathomimetics and oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors .
Patients were considered to be treatment failures in this study if , in the opinion of the investigators , their IOP was uncontrolled by the masked study medication or there was evidence of further optic nerve damage or visual field loss , and surgery was indicated .
Of 171 patients receiving masked medication , 84 were treated with apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % and 87 were treated with placebo ( apraclonidine vehicle ) .
Apraclonidine treatment resulted in a significantly greater percentage of treatment successes compared to patients treated with placebo .
In this placebo - controlled maximum therapy trial , 14 . 3 % of patients treated with apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % were discontinued due to adverse events , primarily allergic - like reactions ( 12 . 9 % ) .
The IOP lowering efficacy of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % diminishes over time in some patients .
This loss of effect , or tachyphylaxis , appears to be an individual occurrence with a variable time of onset and should be closely monitored .
An unpredictable decrease of IOP control in some patients , incidence of ocular allergic responses and systemic side effects , may limit the utility of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % .
However , patients on maximally tolerated medical therapy may still benefit from the additional IOP reduction provided by the short - term use of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % .
Topical use of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % leads to systemic absorption .
Studies of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % dosed one drop three times a day in both eyes for 10 days , in normal volunteers , yielded mean peak and trough concentrations of 0 . 9 ng / mL and 0 . 5 ng / mL , respectively .
The half - life of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % was calculated to be 8 hours .
Apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % , because of its alpha adrenergic activity , is a vasoconstrictor .
Single dose ocular blood flow studies in monkeys , using the microsphere technique , demonstrated a reduced blood flow for the anterior segment ; however , no reduction in blood flow was observed in the posterior segment of the eye after a topical dose of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % .
Ocular blood flow studies have not been conducted in humans .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % is indicated for short - term adjunctive therapy , in patients on maximally tolerated medical therapy , who require additional IOP reduction .
Patients on maximally tolerated medical therapy , who are treated with apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % to delay surgery , should have frequent follow - up examinations and treatment should be discontinued if the IOP rises significantly .
The addition of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % to patients already using two aqueous suppressing drugs ( i . e . , beta - blocker plus carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ) as part of their maximally tolerated medical therapy may not provide additional benefit .
This is because apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % is an aqueous suppressing drug and the addition of a third aqueous suppressant may not significantly reduce IOP .
The IOP lowering efficacy of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % diminishes over time in some patients .
This loss of effect , or tachyphylaxis , appears to be an individual occurrence with a variable time of onset and should be closely monitored .
The benefit for most patients is less than one month .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to apraclonidine or any other component of this medication , as well as systemic clonidine .
It is also contraindicated in patients receiving monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitors .
WARNINGS Not for injection or oral ingestion .
FOR TOPICAL OPHTHALMIC USE ONLY .
PRECAUTIONS General Glaucoma patients on maximally tolerated medical therapy who are treated with apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % to delay surgery should have their visual fields monitored periodically .
Although the topical use of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % has not been studied in renal failure patients , structurally related clonidine undergoes a significant increase in half - life in patients with severe renal impairment .
Close monitoring of cardiovascular parameters in patients with impaired renal function is advised if they are candidates for topical apraclonidine therapy .
Close monitoring of cardiovascular parameters in patients with impaired liver function is also advised as the systemic dosage form of clonidine is partly metabolized in the liver .
While the topical administration of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % had minimal effect on heart rate or blood pressure in clinical studies evaluating glaucoma patients , the preclinical pharmacology profile of this drug suggests that caution should be observed in treating patients with severe , uncontrolled cardiovascular disease , including hypertension .
The possibility of a vasovagal attack should be considered and caution should be exercised in patients with a history of such episodes .
Apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % should be used with caution in patients with coronary insufficiency , recent myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular disease , chronic renal failure , Raynaud ' s disease , or thromboangiitis obliterans .
Caution and monitoring of depressed patients are advised since apraclonidine has been infrequently associated with depression .
Apraclonidine can cause dizziness and somnolence .
Patients who engage in hazardous activities requiring mental alertness should be warned of the potential for a decrease in mental alertness while using apraclonidine .
Topical ocular administration of two drops of 0 . 5 % , 1 . 0 % , and 1 . 5 % apraclonidine ophthalmic solution to New Zealand albino rabbits three times daily for one month resulted in sporadic and transient instances of minimal corneal edema in the 1 . 5 % group only ; no histopathological changes were noted in those eyes .
Use of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % can lead to an allergic - like reaction characterized wholly or in part by the symptoms of hyperemia , pruritus , discomfort , tearing , foreign body sensation , and edema of the lids and conjunctiva .
If ocular allergic - like symptoms occur , apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % therapy should be discontinued .
Information for Patients Do not touch dropper tip to any surface as this may contaminate the contents .
The preservative in apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % , benzalkonium chloride , may be absorbed by soft contact lenses .
Contact lenses should be removed during instillation of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % but may be reinserted 15 minutes after instillation .
Drug Interactions Apraclonidine should not be used in patients receiving MAO inhibitors ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Although no specific drug interactions with topical glaucoma drugs or systemic medications were identified in clinical studies of apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % , the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants ( alcohol , barbiturates , opiates , sedatives , anesthetics ) should be considered .
Tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to blunt the hypotensive effect of systemic clonidine .
It is not known whether the concurrent use of these agents with apraclonidine can lead to a reduction in IOP lowering effect .
No data on the level of circulating catecholamines after apraclonidine withdrawal are available .
Caution , however , is advised in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines .
An additive hypotensive effect has been reported with the combination of systemic clonidine and neuroleptic therapy .
Systemic clonidine may inhibit the production of catecholamines in response to insulin - induced hypoglycemia and mask the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia .
Since apraclonidine may reduce pulse and blood pressure , caution in using drugs such as beta - blockers ( ophthalmic and systemic ) , antihypertensives , and cardiac glycosides is advised .
Patients using cardiovascular drugs concurrently with apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % should have pulse and blood pressures frequently monitored .
Caution should be exercised with simultaneous use of clonidine and other similar pharmacologic agents .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No significant change in tumor incidence or type was observed following two years of oral administration of apraclonidine HCl to rats and mice at dosages of 1 . 0 and 0 . 6 mg / kg , up to 20 and 12 times , respectively , the maximum dose recommended for human topical ocular use .
Apraclonidine HCl was not mutagenic in a series of in vitro mutagenicity tests , including the Ames test , a mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay , a chromosome aberration assay in cultured Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells , a sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells , and a cell transformation assay .
An in vivo mouse micronucleus assay conducted with apraclonidine HCl also provided no evidence of mutagenicity .
Reproduction and fertility studies in rats showed no adverse effect on male or female fertility at a dose of 0 . 5 mg / kg ( 5 to 10 times the maximum recommended human dose ) .
Pregnancy Apraclonidine HCl has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rabbits when given in an oral dose of 3 . 0 mg / kg ( 60 times the maximum recommended human dose ) .
Dose related maternal toxicity was observed in pregnant rats at 0 . 3 mg / kg ( 6 times the maximum recommended human dose ) .
There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women .
Apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when apraclonidine ophthalmic solution 0 . 5 % is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients .
