Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - Release Tablets , USP is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
HOW SUPPLIED METFORMIN HYDROCHLORIDE EXTENDED - RELEASE TABLETS ARE SUPPLIED : 750 mg - White to Off - White capsule shaped no score imprint code 102 Bottles of 30 NDC 43063 - 902 - 30 Bottles of 60 NDC 43063 - 902 - 60 There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes with metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets or any other pharmacologic agent .
Dosage of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance , while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily doses .
The maximum recommended daily dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets in adults is 2000 mg .
Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should generally be given once daily with the evening meal .
Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be started at a low dose , with gradual dose escalation , both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient .
During treatment initiation and dose titration ( see Recommended Dosing Schedule ) , fasting plasma glucose should be used to determine the therapeutic response to metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient .
Thereafter , glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately three months .
The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets , either when used as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylurea or insulin .
Monitoring of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin will also permit detection of primary failure , i . e . , inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication , and secondary failure , i . e . , loss of an adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness .
Short - term administration of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually well - controlled on diet alone .
Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets must be swallowed whole and never crushed or chewed .
Occasionally , the inactive ingredients of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets will be eliminated in the feces as a soft , hydrated mass .
( See Patient information printed below . )
Recommended Dosing Schedule Adults - In general , clinically significant responses are not seen at doses below 1500 mg per day .
However , a lower recommended starting dose and gradually increased dosage is advised to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms .
The usual starting dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablet is 500 mg once daily with the evening meal .
Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly , up to a maximum of 2000 mg once daily with the evening meal .
If glycemic control is not achieved on metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets 2000 mg once daily , a trial of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets 1000 mg twice daily should be considered .
In a randomized trial , patients currently treated with metformin hydrochloride tablets were switched to metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
Results of this trial suggest that patients receiving metformin hydrochloride tablets treatment may be safely switched to metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets once daily at the same total daily dose , up to 2000 mg once daily .
Following a switch from metformin hydrochloride tablets to metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets , glycemic control should be closely monitored and dosage adjustments made accordingly Pediatrics â€“ Safety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established .
Transfer From Other Antidiabetic Therapy When transferring patients from standard oral hypoglycemic agents other than chlorpropamide to metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets , no transition period generally is necessary .
When transferring patients from chlorpropamide , care should be exercised during the first two weeks because of the prolonged retention of chlorpropamide in the body , leading to overlapping drug effects and possible hypoglycemia .
Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - Release Tablets and Oral Sulfonylurea Therapy in Adult Patients If patients have not responded to four weeks of the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets monotherapy , consideration should be given to gradual addition of an oral sulfonylurea while continuing metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets at the maximum dose , even if prior primary or secondary failure to a sulfonylurea has occurred .
Clinical and pharmacokinetic drug - drug interaction data are currently available only for metformin plus glyburide ( glibenclamide ) .
With concomitant metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets and sulfonylurea therapy , the desired control of blood glucose may be obtained by adjusting the dose of each drug .
However , attempts should be made to identify the minimum effective dose of each drug to achieve this goal .
With concomitant metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets and sulfonylurea therapy , the risk of hypoglycemia associated with sulfonylurea therapy continues and may be increased .
Appropriate precautions should be taken .
( See Package Insert of the respective sulfonylurea . )
If patients have not satisfactorily responded to one to three months of concomitant therapy with the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets and the maximum dose of an oral sulfonylurea , consider therapeutic alternatives including switching to insulin with or without metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
Concomitant Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - Release Tablets and Insulin Therapy in Adult Patients The current insulin dose should be continued upon initiation of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets therapy .
Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets therapy should be initiated at 500 mg once daily in patients on insulin therapy .
For patients not responding adequately , the dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be increased by 500 mg after approximately 1 week and by 500 mg every week thereafter until adequate glycemic control is achieved .
The maximum recommended daily dose is 2000 mg for metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
It is recommended that the insulin dose be decreased by 10 % to 25 % when fasting plasma glucose concentrations decrease to less than 120 mg / dL in patients receiving concomitant insulin and metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
Further adjustment should be individualized based on glucose - lowering response .
Specific Patient Populations Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets are not recommended for use in pregnancy .
Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablet is not recommended in pediatric patients ( below the age of 17 years ) .
The initial and maintenance dosing of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be conservative in patients with advanced age , due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population .
Any dosage adjustment should be based on a careful assessment of renal function .
Generally , elderly , debilitated , and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of lactic acidosis , particularly in the elderly .
WARNING : LACTIC ACIDOSIS Postmarketing cases of metformin - associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death , hypothermia , hypotension , and resistant bradyarrhythmias .
The onset of metformin associated lactic acidosis is often subtle , accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise , myalgias , respiratory distress , somnolence , and abdominal pain .
Metformin associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels ( > 5 mmol / Liter ) , anion gap acidosis ( without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia ) , an increased lactate / pyruvate ratio ; and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg / mL ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
Risk factors for metformin - associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment , concomitant use of certain drugs ( e . g . carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate ) , age 65 years old or greater , having a radiological study with contrast , surgery and other procedures , hypoxic states ( e . g . , acute congestive heart failure ) , excessive alcohol intake , and hepatic impairment .
Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin - associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and PRECAUTIONS ) .
If metformin - associated lactic acidosis is suspected , immediately discontinue metformin and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting .
Prompt hemodialysis is recommended ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
