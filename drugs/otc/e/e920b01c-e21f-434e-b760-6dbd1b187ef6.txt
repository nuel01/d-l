[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] INDICATIONS AND USAGE Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension .
These fixed - dose combinations are not indicated for initial therapy ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
In using lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets , consideration should be given to the fact that an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor , captopril , has caused agranulocytosis , particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease , and that available data are insufficient to show that lisinopril does not have a similar risk .
( See WARNINGS . )
In considering use of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets , it should be noted that Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non - Blacks .
( See WARNINGS , Head and Neck Angioedema . )
CONTRAINDICATIONS Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product and in patients with a history of angioedema related to previous treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and in patients with hereditary or idiopathic angioedema .
Because of the hydrochlorothiazide component , this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide - derived drugs .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide has been evaluated for safety in 930 patients , including 100 patients treated for 50 weeks or more .
In clinical trials with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide no adverse experiences peculiar to this combination drug have been observed .
Adverse experiences that have occurred have been limited to those that have been previously reported with lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide .
The most frequent clinical adverse experiences in controlled trials ( including open label extensions ) with any combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide were : dizziness ( 7 . 5 percent ) , headache ( 5 . 2 percent ) , cough ( 3 . 9 percent ) , fatigue ( 3 . 7 percent ) and orthostatic effects ( 3 . 2 percent ) , all of which were more common than in placebo - treated patients .
Generally , adverse experiences were mild and transient in nature ; but see WARNINGSregarding angioedema and excessive hypotension or syncope .
Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse effects was required in 4 . 4 percent of patients , principally because of dizziness , cough , fatigue and muscle cramps .
Adverse experiences occurring in greater than one percent of patients treated with lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide in controlled clinical trials are shown below .

( See WARNINGS . )
Cough : See PRECAUTIONS , Cough .
Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Serum Electrolytes : See PRECAUTIONS .
Creatinine , Blood Urea Nitrogen : Minor reversible increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine were observed in patients with essential hypertension treated with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide .
More marked increases have also been reported and were more likely to occur in patients with renal artery stenosis .
( See PRECAUTIONS . )
Serum Uric Acid , Glucose , Magnesium , Cholesterol , Triglycerides and Calcium : See PRECAUTIONS .
OVERDOSAGE No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide .
Treatment is symptomatic and supportive .
Therapy with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide should be discontinued and the patient observed closely .
Suggested measures include induction of emesis and / or gastric lavage , and correction of dehydration , electrolyte imbalance and hypotension by established procedures .
Lisinopril Following a single oral dose of 20 mg / kg , no lethality occurred in rats and death occurred in one of 20 mice receiving the same dose .
The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension , for which the usual treatment would be intravenous infusion of normal saline solution .
Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis .
( See WARNINGS , Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure . )
Hydrochlorothiazide Oral administration of a single oral dose of 10 mg / kg to mice and rats was not lethal .
The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion ( hypokalemia , hypochloremia , hyponatremia ) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis .
If digitalis has also been administered , hypokalemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Lisinopril is an effective treatment of hypertension in once - daily doses of 10 to 80 mg , while hydrochlorothiazide is effective in doses of 12 . 5 to 50 mg .
In clinical trials of lisinopril / hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using lisinopril doses of 10 to 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6 . 25 to 50 mg , the antihypertensive response rates generally increased with increasing dose of either component .
The side effects ( see WARNINGS ) of lisinopril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose ; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose - dependent phenomena ( primarily hypokalemia ) and dose - independent phenomena ( e . g . , pancreatitis ) , the former much more common than the latter .
Therapy with any combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose - independent side effects , but addition of lisinopril in clinical trials blunted the hypokalemia normally seen with diuretics .
To minimize dose - independent side effects , it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy .
Dose Titration Guided by Clinical Effect A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10 mg / 12 . 5 mg or lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 20 mg / 12 . 5 mg .
Further increases of either or both components could depend on clinical response .
The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2 - 3 weeks have elapsed .
Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide , but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen , may achieve similar or greater blood pressure control with less potassium loss if they are switched to lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 10 mg / 12 . 5 mg .
Dosage higher than lisinopril 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg should not be used .
Replacement Therapy The combination may be substituted for the titrated individual components .
Use in Renal Impairment The usual regimens of therapy with lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets need not be adjusted as long as the patient ' s creatinine clearance is > 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ( serum creatinine approximately ( 3 mg / dL or 265 Âµmol / L ) .
In patients with more severe renal impairment , loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides , so lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended ( see WARNINGS , Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure ) .
