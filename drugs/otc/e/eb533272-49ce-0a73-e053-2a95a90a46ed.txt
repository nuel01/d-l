Infants ( up to 12 months ) • Infants may be given 2 , 600 lipase units per 120 mL of formula or per breast - feeding .
( 2 . 1 ) • Do not mix PANCREAZE delayed - release capsule contents directly into formula or breast milk prior to administration .
( 2 . 2 ) Children Older than 12 Months and Younger than 4 Years • Enzyme dosing should begin with 1 , 000 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal to a maximum of 2 , 500 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal ( or less than or equal to 10 , 000 lipase units / kg of body weight per day ) , or less than 4 , 000 lipase units / g fat ingested per day .
( 2 . 1 ) Children 4 Years and Older and Adults • Enzyme dosing should begin with 500 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal to a maximum of 2 , 500 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal ( or less than or equal to 10 , 000 lipase units / kg of body weight per day ) , or less than 4 , 000 lipase units / g fat ingested per day .
( 2 . 1 ) Limitations on Dosing • Dosing should not exceed the recommended maximum dosage set forth by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Consensus Conferences Guidelines .
( 2 . 1 ) Administration • PANCREAZE should be swallowed whole .
For infants or patients unable to swallow intact capsules , the contents may be sprinkled on soft acidic food with a pH of 4 . 5 or less , e . g . , applesauce .
( 2 . 2 ) 2 . 1 Dosage PANCREAZE is not interchangeable with other pancrelipase products .
PANCREAZE is orally administered .
Therapy should be initiated at the lowest recommended dose and gradually increased .
The dosage of PANCREAZE should be individualized based on clinical symptoms , the degree of steatorrhea present , and the fat content of the diet ( see Limitations on Dosing below ) .
Dosage recommendations for pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy were published following the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Consensus Conferences .
1 , 2 , 3 PANCREAZE should be administered in a manner consistent with the recommendations of the Conferences provided in the following paragraphs with one exception .
The Conferences recommend doses of 2 , 000 to 4 , 000 lipase units in infants up to 12 months .
PANCREAZE is available in a 2 , 600 lipase unit delayed - release capsule .
The recommended dose of PANCREAZE in infants up to 12 months is 2 , 600 lipase units per 120 mL of formula or per breast - feeding .
Patients may be dosed on a fat ingestion - based or actual body weight - based dosing scheme .
Infants ( up to 12 months ) Infants may be given 2 , 600 lipase units per 120 mL of formula or per breast - feeding .
Do not mix PANCREAZE delayed - release capsule contents directly into formula or breast milk prior to administration [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Children Older than 12 Months and Younger than 4 Years Enzyme dosing should begin with 1 , 000 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal for children less than age 4 years to a maximum of 2 , 500 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal ( or less than or equal to 10 , 000 lipase units / kg of body weight per day ) , or less than 4 , 000 lipase units / g fat ingested per day .
Children 4 Years and Older and Adults Enzyme dosing should begin with 500 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal for those older than age 4 years to a maximum of 2 , 500 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal ( or less than or equal to 10 , 000 lipase units / kg of body weight per day ) , or less than 4 , 000 lipase units / g fat ingested per day .
Usually , half of the prescribed PANCREAZE dose for an individualized full meal should be given with each snack .
The total daily dose should reflect approximately three meals plus two or three snacks per day .
Enzyme doses expressed as lipase units / kg of body weight per meal should be decreased in older patients because they weigh more but tend to ingest less fat per kilogram of body weight .
Limitations on Dosing Dosing should not exceed the recommended maximum dosage set forth by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Consensus Conferences Guidelines .
1 , 2 , 3 If symptoms and signs of steatorrhea persist , the dosage may be increased by a healthcare professional .
Patients should be instructed not to increase the dosage on their own .
There is great inter - individual variation in response to enzymes ; thus , a range of doses is recommended .
Changes in dosage may require an adjustment period of several days .
If doses are to exceed 2 , 500 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal , further investigation is warranted .
Doses greater than 2 , 500 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal ( or greater than 10 , 000 lipase units / kg of body weight per day ) should be used with caution and only if they are documented to be effective by 3 - day fecal fat measures that indicate a significantly improved coefficient of fat absorption .
Doses greater than 6 , 000 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal have been associated with colonic strictures , indicative of fibrosing colonopathy , in children with cystic fibrosis less than 12 years of age [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Patients currently receiving higher doses than 6 , 000 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal should be examined and the dosage either immediately decreased or titrated downward to a lower range .
2 . 2 Administration PANCREAZE should always be taken as prescribed by a healthcare professional .
Infants ( up to 12 months ) PANCREAZE should be administered to infants immediately prior to each feeding , using a dosage of 2 , 600 lipase units per 120 mL of formula or per breast - feeding ( i . e . , one delayed - release capsule with 2 , 600 USP units of lipase ) .
Contents of the delayed - release capsule may be sprinkled on small amounts of acidic soft food with a pH of 4 . 5 or less ( e . g . , applesauce ) and given to the infant within 15 minutes .
Contents of the delayed - release capsule may also be administered directly to the mouth .
Administration should be followed by breast milk or formula .
Contents of the delayed - release capsule should not be mixed directly into formula or breast milk as this may diminish efficacy .
Care should be taken to ensure that PANCREAZE is not crushed or chewed or retained in the mouth , to avoid irritation of the oral mucosa .
Children and Adults PANCREAZE should be taken during meals or snacks , with sufficient fluid .
PANCREAZE delayed - release capsules and delayed - release capsule contents should not be crushed or chewed .
Delayed - release capsules should be swallowed whole .
For patients who are unable to swallow intact delayed - release capsules , the delayed - release capsules may be carefully opened and the contents sprinkled on small amounts of acidic soft food with a pH of 4 . 5 or less ( e . g . , applesauce ) .
The PANCREAZE - soft food mixture should be swallowed immediately without crushing or chewing , and followed with water or juice to ensure complete ingestion .
Care should be taken to ensure that no drug is retained in the mouth .

( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Fibrosing colonopathy is associated with high - dose use of pancreatic enzyme replacement .
Exercise caution when doses of PANCREAZE exceed 2 , 500 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal ( or greater than 10 , 000 lipase units / kg of body weight per day ) .
( 5 . 1 ) • To avoid irritation of oral mucosa , do not chew PANCREAZE or retain in the mouth .
( 5 . 2 ) • Exercise caution when prescribing PANCREAZE to patients with gout , renal impairment , or hyperuricemia .
( 5 . 3 ) • There is theoretical risk of viral transmission with all pancreatic enzyme products including PANCREAZE .
( 5 . 4 ) • Exercise caution when administering pancrelipase to a patient with a known allergy to proteins of porcine origin .
( 5 . 5 ) 5 . 1 Fibrosing Colonopathy Fibrosing colonopathy has been reported following treatment with different pancreatic enzyme products .
4 , 5 Fibrosing colonopathy is a rare serious adverse reaction initially described in association with high - dose pancreatic enzyme use , usually with use over a prolonged period of time and most commonly reported in pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis .
The underlying mechanism of fibrosing colonopathy remains unknown .
Doses of pancreatic enzyme products exceeding 6 , 000 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal have been associated with colonic strictures in children less than 12 years of age .
1 Patients with fibrosing colonopathy should be closely monitored because some patients may be at risk of progressing to stricture formation .
It is uncertain whether regression of fibrosing colonopathy occurs .
1 It is generally recommended , unless clinically indicated , that enzyme doses should be less than 2 , 500 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal ( or less than 10 , 000 lipase units / kg of body weight per day ) or less than 4 , 000 lipase units / g fat ingested per day [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Doses greater than 2 , 500 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal ( or greater than 10 , 000 lipase units / kg of body weight per day ) should be used with caution and only if they are documented to be effective by 3 - day fecal fat measures that indicate a significantly improved coefficient of fat absorption .
Patients receiving higher doses than 6 , 000 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal should be examined and the dosage either immediately decreased or titrated downward to a lower range .
5 . 2 Potential for Irritation to Oral Mucosa Care should be taken to ensure that no drug is retained in the mouth .
PANCREAZE should not be crushed or chewed or mixed in foods having a pH greater than 4 . 5 .
These actions can disrupt the protective enteric coating resulting in early release of enzymes , irritation of oral mucosa , and / or loss of enzyme activity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
For patients who are unable to swallow intact delayed - release capsules , the delayed - release capsules may be carefully opened and the contents sprinkled to a small amount of acidic soft food with a pH of 4 . 5 or less , such as applesauce .
The PANCREAZE - soft food mixture should be swallowed immediately and followed with water or juice to ensure complete ingestion .
5 . 3 Potential for Risk of Hyperuricemia Caution should be exercised when prescribing PANCREAZE to patients with gout , renal impairment , or hyperuricemia .
Porcine - derived pancreatic enzyme products contain purines that may increase blood uric acid levels .
5 . 4 Potential Viral Exposure from the Product Source PANCREAZE is sourced from pancreatic tissue from swine used for food consumption .
Although the risk that PANCREAZE will transmit an infectious agent to humans has been reduced by testing for certain viruses during manufacturing and by inactivating certain viruses during manufacturing , there is a theoretical risk for transmission of viral disease , including diseases caused by novel or unidentified viruses .
Thus , the presence of porcine viruses that might infect humans cannot be definitely excluded .
However , no cases of transmission of an infectious illness associated with the use of porcine pancreatic extracts have been reported .
5 . 5 Allergic Reactions Caution should be exercised when administering pancrelipase to a patient with a known allergy to proteins of porcine origin .
Rarely , severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis , asthma , hives , and pruritus have been reported with other pancreatic enzyme products with different formulations of the same active ingredient ( pancrelipase ) .
The risks and benefits of continued PANCREAZE treatment in patients with severe allergy should be taken into consideration with the overall clinical needs of the patient .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions reported with different pancreatic enzyme products of the same active ingredient ( pancrelipase ) include fibrosing colonopathy , hyperuricemia and allergic reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ] .
• Treatment - emergent adverse events occurring in at least 2 patients ( greater than or equal to 10 % ) receiving PANCREAZE or placebo are abdominal pain , abdominal pain upper , flatulence , diarrhea , abnormal feces , and fatigue .

The short - term safety of PANCREAZE was assessed in two clinical trials conducted in 57 patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency ( EPI ) due to CF . Study 1 was conducted in 40 patients , ages 8 years to 57 years ; Study 2 was conducted in 17 patients , ages 6 months to 30 months .
In Study 1 , PANCREAZE was administered in a dose of approximately 6 , 300 lipase units per kilogram per day for lengths of treatment ranging from 8 to 26 days ; in Study 2 , PANCREAZE was administered in four treatment arms ( doses of 1 , 375 , 2 , 875 , 4 , 735 , and 5 , 938 lipase units per kilogram per day ) for lengths of treatment ranging from 6 to 11 days .
The population was nearly evenly distributed in gender , and approximately 96 % of patients were Caucasian .
Study 1 was a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study of 40 patients , ages 8 to 57 years , with EPI due to CF . In this study , patients received PANCREAZE at individually titrated doses ( not to exceed 2 , 500 lipase units per kilogram per meal ) for 14 days , followed by randomization to PANCREAZE or matching placebo for 7 days of treatment .
The mean exposure to PANCREAZE during this study , including titration period and randomized withdrawal period , was 18 days .
The incidence of adverse events ( regardless of causality ) was higher during placebo treatment ( 60 % ) than during PANCREAZE treatment ( 40 % ) .
The most common adverse events reported during the study were gastrointestinal complaints , which were reported more commonly during placebo treatment ( 55 % ) than during PANCREAZE treatment ( 30 % ) .
The type and incidence of adverse events were similar in children ( 8 to 11 years ) , adolescents ( 12 to 17 years ) , and adults ( greater than 18 years ) .
Table 1 enumerates treatment - emergent adverse events that occurred in at least 2 patients ( greater than or equal to 10 % ) treated with either PANCREAZE or placebo in Study 1 .
Adverse events were classified by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) terminology .
Table 1 . Treatment - Emergent Adverse Events Occurring in at Least 2 Patients ( Greater Than or Equal to 10 % ) in Either Treatment Group of the Placebo - Controlled , Clinical Study of PANCREAZEMedDRA Primary System Organ Class Preferred Term PANCREAZE ( N = 20 ) n ( % ) Placebo ( N = 20 ) n ( % ) Gastrointestinal Disorders Abdominal pain 2 ( 10 % ) 3 ( 15 % ) Abdominal pain upper 1 ( 5 % ) 3 ( 15 % ) Flatulence 1 ( 5 % ) 3 ( 15 % ) Diarrhea 0 ( 0 % ) 4 ( 20 % ) Abnormal feces 0 ( 0 % ) 3 ( 15 % ) General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions Fatigue 0 ( 0 % ) 2 ( 10 % ) Study 2 was a randomized , investigator - blinded , dose - ranging study of 17 patients , ages 6 months to 30 months , with EPI due to CF . All patients were transitioned from their usual PEP treatment to PANCREAZE at 375 lipase units per kilogram body weight per meal for a 6 day run - in period .
Patients were then randomized to receive PANCREAZE at one of four doses ( 375 , 750 , 1 , 125 , and 1 , 500 lipase units per kilogram body weight per meal ) for 5 days .
Adverse events were collected on patient diary entries and at each study visit .
The most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal , including diarrhea and vomiting , and were similar in type and frequency across treatment arms and to those reported in the double - blind , placebo - controlled trial ( Study 1 ) .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Postmarketing data for PANCREAZE have been available since 1988 .
The safety data are similar to those described below .
Delayed - and immediate - release pancreatic enzyme products with different formulations of the same active ingredient ( pancrelipase ) have been used for the treatment of patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis and other conditions , such as chronic pancreatitis .
The long - term safety profile of these products has been described in the medical literature .
The most serious adverse events included fibrosing colonopathy , distal intestinal obstruction syndrome ( DIOS ) , recurrence of pre - existing carcinoma , and severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis , asthma , hives , and pruritus .
The most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders , including abdominal pain , diarrhea , flatulence , constipation and nausea , and skin disorders including pruritus , urticaria and rash .
In general , these products have a well - defined and favorable risk - benefit profile in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug interactions have been identified .
No formal interaction studies have been conducted .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Patients • The safety and effectiveness of PANCREAZE were assessed in pediatric patients , aged 6 to 30 months old and aged 8 to 17 years old .
( 8 . 4 ) • The safety and efficacy of pancreatic enzyme products with different formulations of pancrelipase in pediatric patients have been described in the medical literature and through clinical experience .
( 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published data from case reports with pancrelipase use in pregnant women have not identified a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Pancrelipase is minimally absorbed systematically ; therefore , maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with pancrelipase .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of pancrelipase in either human or animal milk , the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production .
Pancrelipase is minimally absorbed systemically following oral administration , therefore maternal use is not expected to result in clinically relevant exposure of breastfed infants to the drug .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for PANCREAZE and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from PANCREAZE or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 3 Pediatric Use The short - term safety and effectiveness of PANCREAZE were assessed in two clinical studies in pediatric patients with EPI due to CF ; one study included patients ages 6 to 30 months , and the other included patients ages 8 years to 17 years .
Study 1 was a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study in 40 patients , 14 of whom were pediatric patients , including 7 children aged 8 to 11 years , and 7 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years .
The safety and efficacy in pediatric patients in this study were similar to adult patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Study 2 was a randomized , investigator - blinded , dose - ranging study in 17 pediatric patients aged 6 to 30 months .
When patient regimen was switched from their usual PEP regimen to PANCREAZE , patients showed similar control of their fat malabsorption [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The safety and efficacy of pancreatic enzyme products with different formulations of pancrelipase consisting of the same active ingredients ( lipases , proteases , and amylases ) for treatment of children with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis has been described in the medical literature and through clinical experience .
Dosing of pediatric patients should be in accordance with recommended guidance from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Consensus Conferences [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Doses of other pancreatic enzyme products exceeding 6 , 000 lipase units / kg of body weight per meal have been associated with fibrosing colonopathy and colonic strictures in children less than 12 years of age [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE In Study 1 , a 10 year - old patient was administered a PANCREAZE dose of 12 , 399 lipase units per kilogram per day for the duration of the open - label and randomized withdrawal periods .
The patient experienced mild abdominal pain throughout both study periods .
Abnormal chemistry data at the end of the study included mild elevations of aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , and serum phosphate .
Abnormal hematology data at the end of the study included mild elevations of hematocrit .
No abnormalities from analyses of urinalysis or uric acid were noted .
Chronic high doses of pancreatic enzyme products have been associated with fibrosing colonopathy and colonic strictures [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
High doses of pancreatic enzyme products have been associated with hyperuricosuria and hyperuricemia , and should be used with caution in patients with a history of hyperuricemia , gout , or renal impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The pancreatic enzymes in PANCREAZE catalyze the hydrolysis of fats to monoglyceride , glycerol and free fatty acids , proteins into peptides and amino acids , and starches into dextrins and short chain sugars such as maltose and maltriose in the duodenum and proximal small intestine , thereby acting like digestive enzymes physiologically secreted by the pancreas .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pancreatic enzymes in PANCREAZE are enteric - coated to minimize destruction or inactivation in gastric acid .
PANCREAZE is expected to release most of the enzymes in vivo at pH greater than 5 . 5 .
Pancreatic enzymes are not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in appreciable amounts .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity , genetic toxicology , and animal fertility studies have not been performed with pancrelipase .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The short - term safety and efficacy of PANCREAZE were evaluated in two studies conducted in 57 patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency ( EPI ) associated with cystic fibrosis ( CF ) .
Study 1 was a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study of 40 patients , ages 8 to 57 years , with EPI due to CF . In this study , patients received PANCREAZE at individually titrated doses ( not to exceed 2 , 500 lipase units per kilogram per meal ) for 14 days ( open - label period ) followed by randomization to PANCREAZE or matching placebo for 7 days of treatment ( double - blind withdrawal period ) .
Only patients with coefficient of fat absorption ( CFA ) ≥ 80 % in the open - label period were randomized to the double - blind withdrawal period .
The mean dose during the controlled treatment period was 6 , 400 lipase units per kilogram per day .
All patients consumed a high - fat diet ( greater than or equal to 100 grams of fat per day ) during the treatment period .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in CFA from the open label period to the end of the double - blind withdrawal period .
The CFA was determined by a 72 - hour stool collection period during both treatment periods , when both fat excretion and fat ingestion were measured ( Table 2 ) .
Table 2 .
Change in CFA in Study 1 ( Open - Label Period to End of Double - Blind Withdrawal Period ) PANCREAZE n = 20 Placebo n = 20 CFA [ % ] Open - Label Period [ 1 ] ( Mean , SD ) 88 ( 5 ) 91 ( 5 ) End of Double - Blind Withdrawal Period [ 2 ] ( Mean , SD ) 87 ( 8 ) 56 ( 25 ) Change in CFA [ 3 ] [ % ] Open - Label Period to End of Double - Blind Withdrawal Period ( Mean , SD ) - 2 ( 6 ) - 34 ( 23 ) Treatment Difference Point Estimate ( 95 % CI ) 33 ( 25 , 40 ) [ 1 ] Minimum of 72 hours from start of open label period .
[ 2 ] Double - blind withdrawal period ranged from 4 to 7 days .
[ 3 ] p < 0 . 001 At the end of the double - blind withdrawal period , the mean change in CFA from the open - label period to the end of the double - blind withdrawal period was - 2 % with PANCREAZE treatment compared to - 34 % with placebo treatment .
There were similar responses to PANCREAZE by age and gender .
Study 2 was a randomized , investigator - blinded , dose - ranging study of 17 patients , ages 6 months to 30 months ( mean 18 months ) with EPI due to CF . The final analysis population was limited to 16 patients ; 1 patient was excluded due to withdrawal of consent .
All patients were transitioned from their usual PEP treatment to PANCREAZE at 375 lipase units per kilogram body weight per meal for a 6 - day run - in period .
Patients were then randomized to receive PANCREAZE at one of four doses ( 375 , 750 , 1 , 125 , and 1 , 500 lipase units per kilogram body weight per meal ) for 5 days .
The CFA was measured at the end of the run - in period and at the end of the randomized period ( Table 3 ) .
Table 3 .
Change in CFA in Study 2 ( End of Run - in Period to End of Study ) 375 units lipase / kg / meal n = 4 750 units lipase / kg / meal n = 4 1 , 125 units lipase / kg / meal n = 4 1 , 500 units lipase / kg / meal n = 4 CFA ( % ) Day 6 [ 1 ] ( Mean , SD ) 93 ( 2 ) 90 ( 5 ) 81 ( 11 ) 93 ( 3 ) Day 11 [ 2 ] ( Mean , SD ) 92 ( 3 ) 91 ( 4 ) 80 ( 13 ) 91 ( 2 ) Change in CFA ( % ) Day 6 to Day 11 ( Mean , SD ) - 2 ( 3 ) 1 ( 3 ) - 1 ( 3 ) - 2 ( 3 ) [ 1 ] End of Run - in Period ; [ 2 ] End of Study Overall , patients showed similar CFA at the end of the run - in period ( mean PANCREAZE dose of 1 , 600 lipase units per kilogram body weight per day ) as at the end of the study across the four treatment arms .
