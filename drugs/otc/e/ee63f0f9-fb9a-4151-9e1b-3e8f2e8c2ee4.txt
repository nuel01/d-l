Subjects were allowed to use other rosacea therapies .
A total of 276 subjects applied brimonidine topical gel for at least one year .
The most common adverse events ( ≥ 4 % of subjects ) for the entire study were flushing ( 10 % ) , erythema ( 8 % ) , rosacea ( 5 % ) , nasopharyngitis ( 5 % ) , skin burning sensation ( 4 % ) , increased intraocular pressure ( 4 % ) , and headache ( 4 % ) .
Allergic contact dermatitis Allergic contact dermatitis to brimonidine topical gel was reported in approximately 1 % of subjects across the clinical development program .
Two subjects underwent patch testing with individual product ingredients .
One subject was found to be sensitive to brimonidine tartrate , and one subject was sensitive to phenoxyethanol ( a preservative ) .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of brimonidine topical gel .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Cardiovascular disorders : bradycardia , hypotension ( including orthostatic hypotension ) Immune system disorders : angioedema , hypersensitivity , lip swelling , swollen tongue , throat tightness , urticaria Nervous system disorders : dizziness Skin and subcutaneous disorders : pallor 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Anti - hypertensives / Cardiac Glycosides Alpha - 2 agonists , as a class , may reduce blood pressure .
Caution in using drugs such as beta - blockers , anti - hypertensives and / or cardiac glycosides is advised .
7 . 2 CNS Depressants Although specific drug - drug interactions studies have not been conducted with brimonidine topical gel , the possibility of an additive or potentiating effect with CNS depressants ( alcohol , barbiturates , opiates , sedatives , or anaesthetics ) should be considered .
7 . 3 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitors may theoretically interfere with the metabolism of brimonidine and potentially result in an increased systemic side - effect such as hypotension .
Caution is advised in patients taking MAO inhibitors which can affect the metabolism and uptake of circulating amines .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of brimonidine topical gel in pregnant women .
In animal studies , brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into the fetal circulation to a limited extent .
Brimonidine topical gel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Brimonidine tartrate was not teratogenic when given at oral doses up to 2 . 5 mg / kg / day in pregnant rats during gestation days 6 through 15 and 5 mg / kg / day in pregnant rabbits during gestation days 6 through 18 .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether brimonidine tartrate is excreted in human milk , although in animal studies , brimonidine tartrate has been shown to be excreted in breast milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from brimonidine topical gel in nursing infants , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Keep brimonidine topical gel out of reach of children .
Serious adverse reactions were experienced by two children of a subject in a clinical trial who accidentally ingested brimonidine topical gel [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use One hundred and five subjects aged 65 and older were included in clinical trials with brimonidine topical gel .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects ≥ 65 years of age and younger adult subjects .
Clinical studies of brimonidine topical gel did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
10 OVERDOSAGE No information is available on overdose in adults with brimonidine topical gel .
Oral overdoses of other alpha - 2 adrenergic agonists have been reported to cause symptoms such as hypotension , asthenia , vomiting , lethargy , sedation , bradycardia , arrhythmias , miosis , apnoea , hypotonia , hypothermia , respiratory depression , and seizure .
Treatment of an oral overdose includes supportive and symptomatic therapy ; a patent airway should be maintained .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Brimonidine is a relatively selective alpha - 2 adrenergic agonist .
Topical application of brimonidine topical gel may reduce erythema through direct vasoconstriction .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The absorption of brimonidine from brimonidine topical gel was evaluated in a clinical trial in 24 adult subjects with facial erythema associated with rosacea .
All enrolled subjects received once daily topical application of brimonidine topical gel 1 gram to the entire face for 29 days .
Pharmacokinetic assessments were performed on Day 1 , Day 15 , and Day 29 .
The mean plasma maximum concentration ( Cmax ) and area under the concentration - time curve ( AUC ) were highest on Day 15 , with Cmax and AUC values ( ± standard deviation ) of 46 ± 62 pg / mL and 417 ± 264 pg . hr / mL , respectively .
The systemic drug exposure was slightly lower on Day 29 indicating no further drug accumulation .
Metabolism Brimonidine is extensively metabolized by the liver .
Excretion Urinary excretion is the major route of elimination of brimonidine and its metabolites .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 21 - month oral ( diet ) mouse carcinogenicity study and a 24 - month oral ( diet ) rat carcinogenicity study , no drug - related neoplasms were observed in mice at oral doses of brimonidine tartrate up to 2 . 5 mg / kg / day or in rats at oral doses of brimonidine tartrate up to 1 mg / kg / day .
In a dermal rat carcinogenicity study with brimonidine topical gel , brimonidine tartrate was administered to Wistar rats at topical doses of 0 . 9 ( 0 . 03 % gel ) , 1 . 8 ( 0 . 06 % gel ) , and 5 . 4 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 18 % gel ) in males and 5 . 4 ( 0 . 18 % gel ) , 30 ( 1 % gel ) during Days 1 - 343 / 10 . 8 ( 0 . 36 % gel ) thereafter , and 60 ( 2 % gel ) during Days 1 - 343 / 21 . 6 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 72 % gel ) thereafter in females once daily for 24 months .
No drug - related neoplasms were observed in this study .
In a 12 - month dermal photo - carcinogenicity study , topical doses of 0 % ( brimonidine topical gel vehicle ) , 0 . 18 % , 1 % and 2 % brimonidine tartrate gel were administered to hairless albino mice once daily , five days per week , with concurrent exposure to simulated sunlight .
No drug - related adverse effects were observed in this study .
The results of this study suggest that topical treatment with brimonidine topical gel would not enhance photo - carcinogenesis .
Mutagenesis Brimonidine tartrate was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a series of in vitro and in vivo studies , including the Ames test , a chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cells , and three studies in CD1 mice ( a host - mediated assay , a cytogenetic study , and a dominant lethal assay ) .
Impairment of Fertility Reproduction and fertility studies in rats with brimonidine tartrate demonstrated no adverse effects on male or female fertility at oral doses up to 1 mg / kg / day .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Brimonidine topical gel was evaluated for the treatment of moderate to severe , persistent ( nontransient ) facial erythema of rosacea in two randomized , double - blind , vehicle - controlled clinical trials , which were identical in design .
The trials were conducted in 553 subjects aged 18 years and older who were treated once daily for 4 weeks with either brimonidine topical gel or vehicle .
Overall , 99 % of subjects were Caucasian and 76 % were female .
Baseline disease severity was graded using a 5 - point Clinical Erythema Assessment ( CEA ) scale and a 5 - point Patient Self Assessment ( PSA ) scale , on which subjects scored either “ moderate ” or “ severe ” on both scales .
The primary efficacy endpoint in both pivotal trials was 2 - grade Composite Success , defined as the proportion of subjects with a 2 - grade improvement on both CEA and PSA measured at hours 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 on Day 29 .
Table 2 presents the efficacy results .
In addition to Day 29 , efficacy was evaluated on Day 15 and Day 1 , and the results are presented in Figures 1 and 2 for Studies 1 and 2 , respectively .
