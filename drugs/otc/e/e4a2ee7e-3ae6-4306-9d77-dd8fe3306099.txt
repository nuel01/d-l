6 . 2 Post Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of PADCEV .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Epidermal necrosis , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
6 . 3 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is a potential for immunogenicity .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the trials described below with the incidence of antibodies in other trials or other enfortumab vedotin - ejfv products may be misleading .
Following administration of PADCEV 1 . 25 mg / kg ; 16 / 590 ( 2 . 7 % ) patients tested positive for anti - therapeutic antibody ( ATA ) against enfortumab vedotin - ejfv at one or more post - baseline time points .
Due to the limited number of patients with ATA against enfortumab vedotin - ejfv , no conclusions can be drawn concerning a potential effect of immunogenicity on efficacy , safety or pharmacokinetics .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of dual P - gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with PADCEV may increase the exposure to monomethyl auristatin E ( MMAE ) .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Effects of Other Drugs on PADCEV Dual P - gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Concomitant use with dual P - gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase unconjugated MMAE exposure [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which may increase the incidence or severity of PADCEV toxicities .
Closely monitor patients for signs of toxicity when PADCEV is given concomitantly with dual P - gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Lactation : Advise women not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals , PADCEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available human data on PADCEV use in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk .
In an animal reproduction study , administration of enfortumab vedotin - ejfv to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused maternal toxicity , embryo - fetal lethality , structural malformations and skeletal anomalies at maternal exposures similar to the exposures at the recommended human dose of 1 . 25 mg / kg ( see Data ) .
Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % - 4 % and 15 % - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In a rat pilot embryo - fetal development study , administration of enfortumab vedotin - ejfv on gestation day 6 and 13 during the period of organogenesis resulted in a complete litter loss in all pregnant rats at the maternally toxic dose of 5 mg / kg ( approximately 3 times the exposure at the recommended human dose ) .
A dose of 2 mg / kg ( similar to the exposure at the recommended human dose ) resulted in maternal toxicity , embryo - fetal lethality and structural malformations that included gastroschisis , malrotated hindlimb , absent forepaw , malpositioned internal organs and fused cervical arch .
Additionally , skeletal anomalies ( asymmetric , fused , incompletely ossified , and misshapen sternebrae , misshapen cervical arch , and unilateral ossification of the thoracic centra ) and decreased fetal weight were observed .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of enfortumab vedotin - ejfv in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child , advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with PADCEV and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating PADCEV treatment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception Females PADCEV can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PADCEV and for 2 months after the last dose .
Males Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PADCEV and for 4 months after the last dose .
Infertility Males Based on findings from animal studies , PADCEV may impair male fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of PADCEV in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 680 patients treated with PADCEV in clinical trials , 440 ( 65 % ) were 65 years or older and 168 ( 25 % ) were 75 years or older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Avoid the use of PADCEV in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 x ULN and AST any ) .
PADCEV has only been studied in a limited number of patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( n = 3 ) and has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In another ADC that contains MMAE , the frequency of ≥ Grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths was greater in patients with moderate ( Child - Pugh B ) or severe ( Child - Pugh C ) hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function .
No adjustment in the starting dose is required when administering PADCEV to patients with mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin 1 to 1 . 5 × ULN and AST any , or total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN ) .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild ( CrCL > 60 - 90 mL / min ) , moderate ( CrCL 30 - 60 mL / min ) or severe ( CrCL < 30 mL / min ) renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION Enfortumab vedotin - ejfv is a Nectin - 4 directed antibody - drug conjugate ( ADC ) comprised of a fully human anti - Nectin - 4 IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody ( AGS - 22C3 ) conjugated to the small molecule microtubule disrupting agent , monomethyl auristatin E ( MMAE ) via a protease - cleavable maleimidocaproyl valine - citrulline ( vc ) linker ( SGD - 1006 ) .
Conjugation takes place on cysteine residues that comprise the interchain disulfide bonds of the antibody to yield a product with a drug - to - antibody ratio of approximately 3 . 8 : 1 .
The molecular weight is approximately 152 kDa .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Approximately 4 molecules of MMAE are attached to each antibody molecule .
Enfortumab vedotin - ejfv is produced by chemical conjugation of the antibody and small molecule components .
The antibody is produced by mammalian ( Chinese hamster ovary ) cells and the small molecule components are produced by chemical synthesis .
PADCEV ( enfortumab vedotin - ejfv ) for injection is provided as a sterile , preservative - free , white to off - white lyophilized powder in single - dose vials for intravenous use .
PADCEV is supplied as a 20 mg per vial and a 30 mg per vial and requires reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection , USP , ( 2 . 3 mL and 3 . 3 mL , respectively ) resulting in a clear to slightly opalescent , colorless to slightly yellow solution with a final concentration of 10 mg / mL [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
After reconstitution , each vial allows the withdrawal of 2 mL ( 20 mg ) and 3 mL ( 30 mg ) .
Each mL of reconstituted solution contains 10 mg of enfortumab vedotin - ejfv , histidine ( 1 . 4 mg ) , histidine hydrochloride monohydrate ( 2 . 31 mg ) , polysorbate 20 ( 0 . 2 mg ) and trehalose dihydrate ( 55 mg ) with a pH of 6 . 0 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Enfortumab vedotin - ejfv is an ADC .
The antibody is a human IgG1 directed against Nectin - 4 , an adhesion protein located on the surface of cells .
The small molecule , MMAE , is a microtubule - disrupting agent , attached to the antibody via a protease - cleavable linker .
Nonclinical data suggest that the anticancer activity of enfortumab vedotin - ejfv is due to the binding of the ADC to Nectin - 4 - expressing cells , followed by internalization of the ADC - Nectin - 4 complex , and the release of MMAE via proteolytic cleavage .
Release of MMAE disrupts the microtubule network within the cell , subsequently inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In an exposure - response analysis , higher enfortumab vedotin - ejfv exposure was associated with higher incidence of some adverse reactions ( e . g . , Grade ≥ 2 peripheral neuropathy , Grade ≥ 3 hyperglycemia ) .
The exposure - response relationship for efficacy has not been fully characterized .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At the recommended dose , PADCEV had no large QTc prolongation ( > 20 msec ) .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Population pharmacokinetic analysis included data from 748 patients based on five studies .
Enfortumab vedotin - ejfv pharmacokinetics were characterized after single and multiple doses in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma and other solid tumors .
The exposure parameters of ADC and unconjugated MMAE ( the cytotoxic component of enfortumab vedotin - ejfv ) are summarized in Table 9 below .
Peak ADC concentrations were observed near the end of intravenous infusion while peak MMAE concentrations were observed approximately 2 days after enfortumab vedotin - ejfv dosing .
Minimal accumulation of the ADC and MMAE was observed following repeat administration of enfortumab vedotin - ejfv in patients .
Steady - state concentrations of ADC and MMAE were reached after 1 treatment cycle .
Table 9 .
Exposure parameters of ADC and unconjugated MMAE after first treatment cycle of 1 . 25 mg / kg of enfortumab vedotin - ejfv dose of Days 1 , 8 and 15 Cmax = maximum concentration , AUC0 - 28 d = area under the concentration - time curve from time zero to 28 days , Ctrough , 0 - 28 d = pre - dose concentration on day 28 ADC Mean ( ± SD ) Unconjugated MMAE Mean ( ± SD ) Cmax 28 ( 6 . 1 ) µg / mL 5 . 5 ( 3 . 0 ) ng / mL AUC0 - 28 d 110 ( 26 ) µg ∙ d / mL 85 ( 50 ) ng ∙ d / mL Ctrough , 0 - 28 d 0 . 31 ( 0 . 18 ) µg / mL 0 . 81 ( 0 . 88 ) ng / mL Distribution The estimated mean steady - state volume of distribution of ADC was 12 . 8 liters following administration of enfortumab vedotin - ejfv .
Plasma protein binding of MMAE ranged from 68 % to 82 % , in vitro .
Elimination ADC and MMAE exhibited multi - exponential declines with an elimination half - life of 3 . 6 days and 2 . 6 days , respectively .
The mean clearance ( CL ) of enfortumab vedotin - ejfv and unconjugated MMAE in patients was 0 . 11 L / h and 2 . 11 L / h , respectively , in patients .
Elimination of MMAE appeared to be limited by its rate of release from enfortumab vedotin - ejfv .
Metabolism Enfortumab vedotin - ejfv catabolism has not been studied in humans ; however , it is expected to undergo catabolism to small peptides , amino acids , unconjugated MMAE , and unconjugated MMAE - related catabolites .
Enfortumab vedotin - ejfv releases MMAE via proteolytic cleavage , and MMAE is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 in vitro .
Excretion The excretion of enfortumab vedotin - ejfv is not fully characterized .
Following a single - dose of another ADC that contains MMAE , 17 % of the total MMAE administered was recovered in feces and 6 % in urine over a 1 - week period , primarily as unchanged drug .
A similar excretion profile of MMAE is expected after enfortumab vedotin - ejfv administration .
Specific Populations Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis , no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of enfortumab vedotin - ejfv were observed based on age ( 24 to 90 years ) , sex , or race / ethnicity ( Caucasian , Asian , Black , or others ) .
Hepatic Impairment Based on population pharmacokinetics analysis , there was a 37 % AUC0 - 28 d increase in unconjugated MMAE exposure observed in patients with mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin of 1 to 1 . 5 × ULN and AST any , or total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN , n = 65 ) compared to normal hepatic function .
Enfortumab vedotin - ejfv has only been studied in limited number of patients with moderate hepatic impairment and has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
The effect of moderate or severe hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 x ULN and AST any ) or liver transplantation on the pharmacokinetics of ADC or unconjugated MMAE is unknown .
Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of enfortumab vedotin - ejfv and unconjugated MMAE were evaluated after the administration of 1 . 25 mg / kg of enfortumab vedotin - ejfv to patients with mild ( creatinine clearance ; CrCL > 60 – 90 mL / min ; n = 272 ) , moderate ( CrCL 30 – 60 mL / min ; n = 315 ) and severe ( CrCL < 30 mL / min ; n = 25 ) renal impairment .
No significant differences in exposure ( AUC ) of ADC and MMAE were observed in patients with mild , moderate or severe renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function .
The effect of end stage renal disease with or without dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of ADC or unconjugated MMAE is unknown .
Drug Interaction Trials No clinical trials evaluating the drug - drug interaction potential of enfortumab vedotin - ejfv have been conducted .
Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic ( PBPK ) Modeling Predictions : Dual P - gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitor : Concomitant use of enfortumab vedotin - ejfv with ketoconazole ( a dual P - gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ) is predicted to increase unconjugated MMAE Cmax by 15 % and AUC by 38 % .
Dual P - gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inducer : Concomitant use of enfortumab vedotin - ejfv with rifampin ( a dual P - gp and strong CYP3A4 inducer ) is predicted to decrease unconjugated MMAE Cmax by 28 % and AUC by 53 % .
Sensitive CYP3A substrates : Concomitant use of enfortumab vedotin - ejfv is predicted not to affect exposure to midazolam ( a sensitive CYP3A substrate ) .
In Vitro Studies Transporter Systems : MMAE is a substrate of P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) , but not an inhibitor of P - gp .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with enfortumab vedotin - ejfv or the small molecule cytotoxic agent ( MMAE ) have not been conducted .
MMAE was genotoxic in the rat bone marrow micronucleus study through an aneugenic mechanism .
This effect is consistent with the pharmacological effect of MMAE as a microtubule - disrupting agent .
MMAE was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay ( Ames test ) or the L5178Y mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay .
Fertility studies with enfortumab vedotin - ejfv or MMAE have not been conducted .
However , results of repeat - dose toxicity studies in rats indicate the potential for enfortumab vedotin - ejfv to impair male reproductive function and fertility .
In repeat - dose toxicology studies conducted in rats for up to 13 weeks , doses ≥ 2 mg / kg enfortumab vedotin - ejfv ( at exposures similar to the exposures at the recommended human dose ) resulted in decreases in testes and epididymis weights , seminiferous tubule degeneration , spermatid / spermatocyte depletion in the testes and cell debris , sperm granuloma and hypospermia / abnormal spermatids in the epididymis .
Findings in the testes and epididymis did not reverse by the end of the recovery period .
