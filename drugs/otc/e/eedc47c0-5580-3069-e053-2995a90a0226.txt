DESCRIPTION Polymyxin B Sulfate is one of a group of basic polypeptide antibiotics derived from B polymyxa ( B aerosporous ) .
Polymyxin B sulfate is the sulfate salt of Polymyxins B1 and B2 , which are produced by the growth of Bacillus polymyxa ( Prazmowski ) Migula ( Fam .
Bacillacea ) .
It has a potency of not less than 6000 polymyxin B units per mg , calculated on the anhydrous basis .
The structural formulae are : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Polymyxin B 1 ( R = CH 3 ) Polymyxin B 2 ( R = H ) Each vial contains 500 , 000 polymyxin B units for parenteral or ophthalmic administration .
Polymyxin B for Injection is in powder form suitable for preparation of sterile solutions for intramuscular , intravenous drip , intrathecal , or ophthalmic use .
In the medical literature , dosages have frequently been given in terms of equivalent weights of pure polymyxin B base .
Each milligram of pure polymyxin B base is equivalent to 10 , 000 units of polymyxin B and each microgram of pure polymyxin B base is equivalent to 10 units of polymyxin B . Aqueous solutions of polymyxin B sulfate may be stored up to 12 months without significant loss of potency if kept under refrigeration .
In the interest of safety , solutions for parenteral use should be stored under refrigeration and any unused portion should be discarded after 72 hours .
Polymyxin B sulfate should not be stored in alkaline solutions since they are less stable .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Polymyxin B sulfate has a bactericidal action against almost all gram - negative bacilli except the Proteus group .
Polymyxins increase the permeability of bacterial cell wall membranes .
All gram - positive bacteria , fungi , and the gram - negative cocci , N gonorrhoeae and N meningitidis , are resistant .
Polymyxin B has bactericidal action against almost all Gram - negative bacilli except the Proteus group .
Polymyxins increase the permeability of the bacterial cell membrane leading to death of the cell .
All Gram - positive bacteria , fungi , and Gram - negative cocci , are resistant to polymyxin B . Appropriate methods should be used when performing in vitro susceptibility testing of polymyxin B ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) .
The following in vitro susceptibility test criteria should only be used for interpreting the results of polymyxin B susceptibility testing against P . aeruginosa when the indicated quality control parameters are met during testing .
In vitro susceptibility test interpretive criteria for polymyxin B sulfate against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Minimal Inhibitory Concentration ( MIC ) ( mcg / mL ) Disk Diffusion Interpretive Criteria ( mm ) ( 300 unit disk ) Pathogen Susceptible Intermediate Resistant Susceptible Intermediate Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa ≤ 2 4 ≥ 8 ≥ 12 - ≤ 11 In vitro susceptibility test quality control ranges for polymyxin B sulfate against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Quality Control Organism ( ATCC * Number ) Minimum Inhibatory Concentration ( MIC ) Range ( mcg / mL ) Disk Diffusion Quality Control Range ( 300 unit disk ) ( mm ) Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( 27853 ) 1 - 4 14 - 18 Polymyxin B sulfate is not absorbed from the normal alimentary tract .
Since the drug loses 50 percent of its activity in the presence of serum , active blood levels are low .
Repeated injections may give a cumulative effect .
Levels tend to be higher in infants and children .
The drug is excreted slowly by the kidneys .
Tissue diffusion is poor and the drug does not pass the blood brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid .
In therapeutic dosage , polymyxin B sulfate causes some nephrotoxicity with tubule damage to a slight degree .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Acute Infections Caused by Susceptible Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
Polymyxin B sulfate is a drug of choice in the treatment of infections of the urinary tract , meninges , and bloodstream caused by susceptible strains of Ps .
aeruginosa .
It may also be used topically and subconjunctivally in the treatment of infections of the eye caused by susceptible strains of Ps .
aeruginosa .
It may be indicated in serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the following organisms , when less potentially toxic drugs are ineffective or contraindicated : H influenzae , specifically meningeal infections .
Escherichiacoli , specifically urinary tract infections .
Aerobacter aerogenes , specifically bacteremia .
Klebsiellapneumoniae , specifically bacteremia .
NOTE : IN MENINGEAL INFECTIONS , POLYMYXIN B SULFATE SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED ONLY BY THE INTRATHECAL ROUTE .
To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Polymyxin B for Injection USP and other antibacterial drugs , Polymyxin B for Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria .
When culture and susceptibility information are available , they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy .
In the absence of such data , local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy .
CONTRAINDICATIONS This drug is contraindicated in persons with a prior history of hypersensitivity reactions to polymyxins .
WARNINGS Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including Polymyxin B for Injection , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibiotic treatment of C . difficile and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
PRECAUTIONS General .
Prescribing Polymyxin B for Injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increase the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria .
See WARNING box .
Baseline renal function should be done prior to therapy , with frequent monitoring of renal function and blood levels of the drug during parenteral therapy .
Avoid concurrent use of a curariform muscle relaxant and other neurotoxic drugs ( ether , tubocurarine , succinylcholine , gallamine , decamethonium and sodium citrate ) which may precipitate respiratory depression .
If signs of respiratory paralysis appear , respiration should be assisted as required , and the drug discontinued .
As with other antibiotics , use of this drug may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms , including fungi .
If superinfection occurs , appropriate therapy should be instituted .
Information for Patients Information for Patients .
Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including polymyxin B for injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections .
They do not treat viral infections ( e . g . , the common cold ) .
When polymyxin B for injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection , patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy , the medication should be taken exactly as directed .
Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may ( 1 ) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and ( 2 ) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by polymyxin B for injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future .
Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued .
Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics , patients can develop watery and bloody stools ( with or without stomach cramps and fever ) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic .
If this occurs , patients should contact their physician as soon as possible .
ADVERSE REACTIONS See “ WARNING ” box .
