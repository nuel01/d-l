( 5 . 2 ) • Seizures : Use caution in patients with a history of seizures and patients at increased risk of seizure , including medications that lower the seizure threshold .
( 5 . 3 , 7 . 1 ) • Patients with renal impairment or taking concomitant medications that affect renal function : Use caution , ensure adequate hydration and consider testing .
( 5 . 4 , 7 . 1 , 8 . 6 ) • Mucosal ulcerations : Consider potential for mucosal ulcerations when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease .
( 5 . 5 , 7 . 3 ) • Patients at risk for aspiration : Observe during administration .
( 5 . 7 ) • Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis : Inform patients to seek immediate medical care if symptoms occur .
( 5 . 8 ) 5 . 1 Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities Advise patients to hydrate adequately before , during , and after the use of PEG - 3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution .
Use caution in patients with congestive heart failure when replacing fluids .
If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration including signs of orthostatic hypotension after taking PEG - 3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution , consider performing post - colonoscopy lab tests ( electrolytes , creatinine , and BUN ) and treat accordingly .
Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias , seizures and renal impairment .
Correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities before treatment with PEG - 3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution .
In addition , use caution when prescribing PEG - 3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution for patients who have conditions , or who are using medications , that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure , arrhythmias , and renal impairment [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation .
Use caution when prescribing PEG - 3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias ( e . g . , patients with a history of prolonged QT , uncontrolled arrhythmias , recent myocardial infarction , unstable angina , congestive heart failure , or cardiomyopathy ) .
Consider pre - dose and post - colonoscopy ECGs in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias .
5 . 3 Seizures There have been reports of generalized tonic - clonic seizures and / or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures .
The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities ( e . g . , hyponatremia , hypokalemia , hypocalcemia , and hypomagnesemia ) and low serum osmolality .
The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities .
Use caution when prescribing PEG - 3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure , such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold ( e . g . , tricyclic antidepressants ) , patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines , or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 4 Renal Impairment Use caution when prescribing PEG - 3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution for patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function ( such as diuretics , angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors , angiotensin receptor blockers , or non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .

5 . 5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis Administration of osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations , and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization .
Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and PEG - 3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution may increase this risk [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
Consider the potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) .
5 . 6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected , perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering PEG - 3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis .

Observe these patients during administration of PEG - 3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution , especially if it is administered via nasogastric tube .
Do not combine PEG - 3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution with starch - based thickeners [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) , a component of PEG - 3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution , when mixed with starch - thickened liquids reduces the viscosity of the starch - thickened liquid .
When a PEG - based product used for another indication was mixed in starch - based pre - thickened liquids used in patients with dysphagia , thinning of the liquid occurred and cases of choking and potential aspiration were reported .
5 . 8 Hypersensitivity Reactions PEG - 3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution contains PEG and may cause serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis , angioedema , rash , urticaria , and pruritus [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs and symptoms occur .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • Renal impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Colonic mucosal ulcerations and ischemic colitis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Patients with significant gastrointestinal disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Aspiration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of PEG - 3350 and Electrolytes for Oral Solution were identified in clinical trials or postmarketing reports .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to estimate their frequency , reliably , or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Cardiovascular : arrhythmia , atrial fibrillation , peripheral edema , asystole , and acute pulmonary edema after aspiration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
