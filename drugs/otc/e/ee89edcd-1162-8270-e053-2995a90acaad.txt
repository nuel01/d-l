DESCRIPTION CARNITOR ® ( levocarnitine ) is a carrier molecule in the transport of long - chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane .
The chemical name of levocarnitine is 3 - carboxy - 2 ( R ) - hydroxy - N , N , N - trimethyl - 1 - propanaminium , inner salt .
Levocarnitine is a white crystalline , hygroscopic powder .
It is readily soluble in water , hot alcohol , and insoluble in acetone .
The specific rotation of levocarnitine is between - 29 ° and - 32 ° .
Its chemical structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Empirical Formula : C 7 H 15 NO 3 Molecular Weight : 161 . 20 CARNITOR ® ( levocarnitine ) Injection is a sterile aqueous solution containing 1 g of levocarnitine per 5 mL vial .
The pH is adjusted to 6 . 0 - 6 . 5 with hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY CARNITOR ® ( levocarnitine ) is a naturally occurring substance required in mammalian energy metabolism .
It has been shown to facilitate long - chain fatty acid entry into cellular mitochondria , thereby delivering substrate for oxidation and subsequent energy production .
Fatty acids are utilized as an energy substrate in all tissues except the brain .
In skeletal and cardiac muscle , fatty acids are the main substrate for energy production .
Primary systemic carnitine deficiency is characterized by low concentrations of levocarnitine in plasma , RBC , and / or tissues .
It has not been possible to determine which symptoms are due to carnitine deficiency and which are due to an underlying organic acidemia , as symptoms of both abnormalities may be expected to improve with CARNITOR ® .
The literature reports that carnitine can promote the excretion of excess organic or fatty acids in patients with defects in fatty acid metabolism and / or specific organic acidopathies that bioaccumulate acylCoA esters .
1 - 6 Secondary carnitine deficiency can be a consequence of inborn errors of metabolism or iatrogenic factors such as hemodialysis .
CARNITOR ® may alleviate the metabolic abnormalities of patients with inborn errors that result in accumulation of toxic organic acids .
Conditions for which this effect has been demonstrated are : glutaric aciduria II , methyl malonic aciduria , propionic acidemia , and medium chain fatty acylCoA dehydrogenase deficiency .
7 , 8 Autointoxication occurs in these patients due to the accumulation of acylCoA compounds that disrupt intermediary metabolism .
The subsequent hydrolysis of the acylCoA compound to its free acid results in acidosis which can be life - threatening .
Levocarnitine clears the acylCoA compound by formation of acylcarnitine , which is quickly excreted .
Carnitine deficiency is defined biochemically as abnormally low plasma concentrations of free carnitine , less than 20 µmol / L at one week post term and may be associated with low tissue and / or urine concentrations .
Further , this condition may be associated with a plasma concentration ratio of acylcarnitine / levocarnitine greater than 0 . 4 or abnormally elevated concentrations of acylcarnitine in the urine .
In premature infants and newborns , secondary deficiency is defined as plasma levocarnitine concentrations below age - related normal concentrations .
End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) patients on maintenance hemodialysis may have low plasma carnitine concentrations and an increased ratio of acylcarnitine / carnitine because of reduced intake of meat and dairy products , reduced renal synthesis and dialytic losses .
Certain clinical conditions common in hemodialysis patients such as malaise , muscle weakness , cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrhythmias may be related to abnormal carnitine metabolism .
Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies with CARNITOR ® have shown that administration of levocarnitine to ESRD patients on hemodialysis results in increased plasma levocarnitine concentrations .
PHARMACOKINETICS In a relative bioavailability study in 15 healthy adult male volunteers , CARNITOR ® Tablets were found to be bio - equivalent to CARNITOR ® Oral Solution .
Following 4 days of dosing with 6 tablets of CARNITOR ® 330 mg b . i . d . or 2 g of CARNITOR ® oral solution b . i . d . , the maximum plasma concentration ( C max ) was about 80 µmol / L and the time to maximum plasma concentration ( T max ) occurred at 3 . 3 hours .
The plasma concentration profiles of levocarnitine after a slow 3 minute intravenous bolus dose of 20 mg / kg of CARNITOR ® were described by a two - compartment model .
Following a single i . v . administration , approximately 76 % of the levocarnitine dose was excreted in the urine during the 0 - 24 h interval .
Using plasma concentrations uncorrected for endogenous levocarnitine , the mean distribution half life was 0 . 585 hours and the mean apparent terminal elimination half life was 17 . 4 hours .
The absolute bioavailability of levocarnitine from the two oral formulations of CARNITOR ® , calculated after correction for circulating endogenous plasma concentrations of levocarnitine , was 15 . 1 ± 5 . 3 % for CARNITOR ® Tablets and 15 . 9 ± 4 . 9 % for CARNITOR ® Oral Solution .
Total body clearance of levocarnitine ( Dose / AUC including endogenous baseline concentrations ) was a mean of 4 . 00 L / h .
Levocarnitine was not bound to plasma protein or albumin when tested at any concentration or with any species including the human .
9 In a 9 - week study , 12 ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis for at least 6 months received CARNITOR ® 20 mg / kg three times per week after dialysis .
Prior to initiation of CARNITOR ® therapy , mean plasma levocarnitine concentrations were approximately 20 µmol / L pre - dialysis and 6 µmol / L post - dialysis .
The table summarizes the pharmacokinetic data ( mean ± SD µmol / L ) after the first dose of CARNITOR ® and after 8 weeks of CARNITOR ® therapy .
N = 12 Baseline Single dose 8 weeks C max - 1139 ± 240 1190 ± 270 Trough ( pre - dialysis , pre - dose ) 21 . 3 ± 7 . 7 68 . 4 ± 26 . 1 190 ± 55 After one week of CARNITOR ® therapy ( 3 doses ) , all patients had trough concentrations between 54 and 180 µmol / L ( normal 40 - 50 µmol / L ) and concentrations remained relatively stable or increased over the course of the study .
In a similar study in ESRD patients also receiving 20 mg / kg CARNITOR ® 3 times per week after hemodialysis , 12 - and 24 - week mean pre - dialysis ( trough ) levocarnitine concentrations were 189 ( N = 25 ) and 243 ( N = 23 ) µmol / L , respectively .
In a dose - ranging study in ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis , patients received 10 , 20 , or 40 mg / kg CARNITOR ® 3 times per week following dialysis ( N ~ 30 for each dose group ) .
Mean ± SD trough levocarnitine concentrations ( µmol / L ) by dose after 12 and 24 weeks of therapy are summarized in the table .
12 weeks 24 weeks 10 mg / kg 116 ± 69 148 ± 50 20 mg / kg 210 ± 58 240 ± 60 40 mg / kg 371 ± 111 456 ± 162 While the efficacy of CARNITOR ® to increase carnitine concentrations in patients with ESRD undergoing dialysis has been demonstrated , the effects of supplemental carnitine on the signs and symptoms of carnitine deficiency and on clinical outcomes in this population have not been determined .
METABOLISM AND EXCRETION In a pharmacokinetic study where five normal adult male volunteers received an oral dose of [ 3 H - methyl ] - L - carnitine following 15 days of a high carnitine diet and additional carnitine supplement , 58 to 65 % of the administered radioactive dose was recovered in the urine and feces in 5 to 11 days .
Maximum concentration of [ 3 H - methyl ] - L - carnitine in serum occurred from 2 . 0 to 4 . 5 hr after drug administration .
Major metabolites found were trimethylamine N - oxide , primarily in urine ( 8 % to 49 % of the administered dose ) and [ 3 H ] - γ - butyrobetaine , primarily in feces ( 0 . 44 % to 45 % of the administered dose ) .
Urinary excretion of levocarnitine was about 4 to 8 % of the dose .
Fecal excretion of total carnitine was less than 1 % of the administered dose .
10 After attainment of steady state following 4 days of oral administration of CARNITOR ® Tablets ( 1980 mg q12h ) or Oral Solution ( 2000 mg q12h ) to 15 healthy male volunteers , the mean urinary excretion of levocarnitine during a single dosing interval ( 12 h ) was about 9 % of the orally administered dose ( uncorrected for endogenous urinary excretion ) .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE For the acute and chronic treatment of patients with an inborn error of metabolism which results in secondary carnitine deficiency .
For the prevention and treatment of carnitine deficiency in patients with end stage renal disease who are undergoing dialysis .
CONTRAINDICATIONS None known .
WARNINGS Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis , laryngeal edema , and bronchospasm have been reported following CARNITOR ® administration , mostly in patients with end stage renal disease who are undergoing dialysis .
Some reactions occurred within minutes after intravenous administration of CARNITOR ® .
If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs , discontinue CARNITOR ® treatment and initiate appropriate medical treatment .
Consider the risks and benefits of re - administering CARNITOR ® to individual patients following a severe reaction .
If the decision is made to re - administer the product , monitor patients for a reoccurrence of signs and symptoms of a severe hypersensitivity reaction .
PRECAUTIONS General The safety and efficacy of oral levocarnitine has not been evaluated in patients with renal insufficiency .
Chronic administration of high doses of oral levocarnitine in patients with severely compromised renal function or in ESRD patients on dialysis may result in accumulation of the potentially toxic metabolites , trimethylamine ( TMA ) and trimethylamine - N - oxide ( TMAO ) , since these metabolites are normally excreted in the urine .
Drug Interactions Reports of INR increase with the use of warfarin have been observed .
It is recommended that INR levels be monitored in patients on warfarin therapy after the initiation of treatment with levocarnitine or after dose adjustments .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Mutagenicity tests performed in Salmonella typhimurium , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and Schizosaccharomyces pombe indicate that levocarnitine is not mutagenic .
No long - term animal studies have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of levocarnitine .
Pregnancy Reproductive studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 3 . 8 times the human dose on the basis of surface area and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to CARNITOR ® .
There are , however , no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers Levocarnitine supplementation in nursing mothers has not been specifically studied .
Studies in dairy cows indicate that the concentration of levocarnitine in milk is increased following exogenous administration of levocarnitine .
In nursing mothers receiving levocarnitine , any risks to the child of excess carnitine intake need to be weighed against the benefits of levocarnitine supplementation to the mother .
Consideration may be given to discontinuation of nursing or of levocarnitine treatment .
Pediatric Use See Dosage and Administration .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials Experience Transient nausea and vomiting have been observed .
Less frequent adverse reactions are body odor , nausea , and gastritis .
An incidence for these reactions is difficult to estimate due to the confounding effects of the underlying pathology .
The table below lists the adverse events that have been reported in two double - blind , placebo - controlled trials in patients on chronic hemodialysis .
Events occurring at ≥ 5 % are reported without regard to causality .

In patients with pre - existing seizure activity , an increase in seizure frequency and / or severity has been reported .
Hypersensitivity reactions : Anaphylaxis , laryngeal edema and bronchospasm ( see WARNINGS ) .
OVERDOSAGE There have been no reports of toxicity from levocarnitine overdosage .
Levocarnitine is easily removed from plasma by dialysis .
The intravenous LD 50 of levocarnitine in rats is 5 . 4 g / kg and the oral LD 50 of levocarnitine in mice is 19 . 2 g / kg .
Large doses of levocarnitine may cause diarrhea .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION CARNITOR ® Injection is administered intravenously .
Metabolic Disorders The recommended dose is 50 mg / kg given as a slow 2 - 3 minute bolus injection or by infusion .
Often a loading dose is given in patients with severe metabolic crisis , followed by an equivalent dose over the following 24 hours .
It should be administered q3h or q4h , and never less than q6h either by infusion or by intravenous injection .
All subsequent daily doses are recommended to be in the range of 50 mg / kg or as therapy may require .
The highest dose administered has been 300 mg / kg .
It is recommended that a plasma carnitine concentration be obtained prior to beginning this parenteral therapy .
Weekly and monthly monitoring is recommended as well .
This monitoring should include blood chemistries , vital signs , plasma carnitine concentrations ( the plasma free carnitine concentration should be between 35 and 60 µmol / L ) and overall clinical condition .
ESRD Patients on Hemodialysis The recommended starting dose is 10 - 20 mg / kg dry body weight as a slow 2 - 3 minute bolus injection into the venous return line after each dialysis session .
Initiation of therapy may be prompted by trough ( pre - dialysis ) plasma levocarnitine concentrations that are below normal ( 40 - 50 µmol / L ) .
Dose adjustments should be guided by trough ( pre - dialysis ) levocarnitine concentrations , and downward dose adjustments ( e . g . to 5 mg / kg after dialysis ) may be made as early as the third or fourth week of therapy .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
