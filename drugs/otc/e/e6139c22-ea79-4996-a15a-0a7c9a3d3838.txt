Temporarily discontinue CRESTOR in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis .
Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing CRESTOR dosage .
Instruct patients to promptly report unexplained muscle pain , tenderness , or weakness , particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever .
( 5 . 1 , 7 . 1 , 8 . 5 , 8 . 6 , 8 . 8 ) • • Immune - Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy ( IMNM ) : Rare reports of IMNM , an autoimmune myopathy , have been reported with statin use .
Discontinue CRESTOR if IMNM is suspected .
( 5 . 2 ) • • Hepatic Dysfunction : Increases in serum transaminases have occurred , some persistent .
Rare reports of fatal and non - fatal hepatic failure have occurred .
Consider testing liver enzymes before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter .
If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and / or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs , promptly discontinue CRESTOR .
( 4 , 5 . 3 , 8 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis CRESTOR may cause myopathy [ muscle pain , tenderness , or weakness associated with elevated creatine kinase ( CK ) ] and rhabdomyolysis .
Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins , including CRESTOR .
Risk Factors for Myopathy Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater , uncontrolled hypothyroidism , renal impairment , concomitant use with certain other drugs ( including other lipid - lowering therapies ) , and higher CRESTOR dosage .
Asian patients on CRESTOR may be at higher risk for myopathy [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 8 ) ] .
The myopathy risk is greater in patients taking CRESTOR 40 mg daily compared with lower CRESTOR dosages .
Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis The concomitant use of CRESTOR with cyclosporine or gemfibrozil is not recommended .
CRESTOR dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain antiviral medications , darolutamide , and regorafenib [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
Niacin , fibrates , and colchicine may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Discontinue CRESTOR if markedly elevated CK levels occur or if myopathy is either diagnosed or suspected .
Muscle symptoms and CK elevations may resolve if CRESTOR is discontinued .
Temporarily discontinue CRESTOR in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis ( e . g . , sepsis ; shock ; severe hypovolemia ; major surgery ; trauma ; severe metabolic , endocrine , or electrolyte disorders ; or uncontrolled epilepsy ) .
Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the CRESTOR dosage .
Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain , tenderness or weakness , particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever .
5 . 2 Immune - Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports of immune - mediated necrotizing myopathy ( IMNM ) , an autoimmune myopathy , associated with statin use , including reports of recurrence when the same or a different statin was administered .
IMNM is characterized by proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase that persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment ; positive anti - HMG CoA reductase antibody ; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy ; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents .
Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary .
Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required .
Discontinue CRESTOR if IMNM is suspected .
5 . 3 Hepatic Dysfunction Increases in serum transaminases have been reported with use of CRESTOR [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In most cases , these changes appeared soon after initiation , were transient , were not accompanied by symptoms , and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy .
In a pooled analysis of placebo - controlled trials , increases in serum transaminases to more than three times the ULN occurred in 1 . 1 % of patients taking CRESTOR versus 0 . 5 % of patients treated with placebo .
Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with CRESTOR .
There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non - fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins , including CRESTOR .
Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and / or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Consider liver enzyme testing before CRESTOR initiation and when clinically indicated thereafter .
CRESTOR is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and / or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs , promptly discontinue CRESTOR .
5 . 4 Proteinuria and Hematuria In the CRESTOR clinical trial program , dipstick - positive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were observed among CRESTOR treated patients .
These findings were more frequent in patients taking CRESTOR 40 mg , when compared to lower doses of CRESTOR or comparator statins , though it was generally transient and was not associated with worsening renal function .
Although the clinical significance of this finding is unknown , consider a dose reduction for patients on CRESTOR therapy with unexplained persistent proteinuria and / or hematuria during routine urinalysis testing .
5 . 5 Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins , including CRESTOR .
Based on clinical trial data with CRESTOR , in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Optimize lifestyle measures , including regular exercise , maintaining a healthy body weight , and making healthy food choices .

Once the INR is stable , monitor INR at regularly recommended intervals .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm .
( 8 . 1 ) • • Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended during treatment with CRESTOR .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Discontinue CRESTOR when pregnancy is recognized .
Alternatively , consider the ongoing therapeutic needs of the individual patient .
CRESTOR decreases synthesis of cholesterol and possibly other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol ; therefore , CRESTOR may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant patients based on the mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
In addition , treatment of hyperlipidemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy .
Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid - lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long - term therapy of primary hyperlipidemia for most patients .
Available data from case series and prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies over decades of use with statins in pregnant women have not identified a drug - associated risk of major congenital malformations .
Published data from prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies with CRESTOR use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine if there is a drug - associated risk of miscarriage ( see Data ) .
In animal reproduction studies , no adverse developmental effects were observed in pregnant rats or rabbits orally administered rosuvastatin during the period of organogenesis at doses that resulted in systemic exposures equivalent to human exposures at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 40 mg / day , based on AUC and body surface area ( mg / m2 ) , respectively ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data A Medicaid cohort linkage study of 1152 statin - exposed pregnant women compared to 886 , 996 controls did not find a significant teratogenic effect from maternal use of statins in the first trimester of pregnancy , after adjusting for potential confounders – including maternal age , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , obesity , and alcohol and tobacco use – using propensity score ‑ based methods .
The relative risk of congenital malformations between the group with statin use and the group with no statin use in the first trimester was 1 . 07 ( 95 % confidence interval 0 . 85 to 1 . 37 ) after controlling for confounders , particularly pre - existing diabetes mellitus .
There were also no statistically significant increases in any of the organ - specific malformations assessed after accounting for confounders .
In the majority of pregnancies , statin treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified .
Study limitations include reliance on physician coding to define the presence of a malformation , lack of control for certain confounders such as body mass index , use of prescription dispensing as verification for the use of a statin , and lack of information on non - live births .
Animal Data In female rats given 5 , 15 and 50 mg / kg / day before mating and continuing through to gestation day 7 resulted in decreased fetal body weight ( female pups ) and delayed ossification at 50 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the human exposure at the MRHD dose of 40 mg / day based on AUC ) .
In pregnant rats given 2 , 10 and 50 mg / kg / day of rosuvastatin from gestation day 7 through lactation day 21 ( weaning ) , decreased pup survival occurred at 50 mg / kg / day ( dose equivalent to 12 times the MRHD of 40 mg / day based body surface area ) .
In pregnant rabbits given 0 . 3 , 1 , and 3 mg / kg / day of rosuvastatin from gestation day 6 to day 18 , decreased fetal viability and maternal mortality was observed at 3 mg / kg / day ( dose equivalent to the MRHD of 40 mg / day based on body surface area ) .
Rosuvastatin crosses the placenta in rats and rabbits and is found in fetal tissue and amniotic fluid at 3 % and 20 % , respectively , of the maternal plasma concentration following a single 25 mg / kg oral gavage dose on gestation day 16 in rats .
In rabbits , fetal tissue distribution was 25 % of maternal plasma concentration after a single oral gavage dose of 1 mg / kg on gestation day 18 .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from case reports in published literature indicate that CRESTOR is present in human milk .
There is no available information on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production .
Statins , including CRESTOR , decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol and may cause harm to the breastfed infant .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant , based on the mechanism of action , advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with CRESTOR [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of CRESTOR as an adjunct to diet to reduce LDL - C have been established in pediatric patients 8 years of age and older with HeFH .
Use of CRESTOR for this indication is based on one 12 - week controlled trial with a 40 - week open - label extension period in 176 pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with HeFH and one 2 - year open - label , uncontrolled trial in 175 pediatric patients 8 years of age and older with HeFH [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
In the 1 - year trial with a 12 - week controlled phase , there was no detectable effect of CRESTOR on growth , weight , BMI ( body mass index ) , or sexual maturation in patients aged 10 to 17 years .
The safety and effectiveness of CRESTOR as an adjunct to other LDL - C - lowering therapies to reduce LDL - C have been established pediatric patients 7 years of age and older with HoFH .
Use of CRESTOR for this indication is based on a randomized , placebo - controlled , cross - over study in 14 pediatric patients 7 years of age and older with HoFH [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of CRESTOR have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 8 years of age with HeFH , younger than 7 years of age with HoFH , or in pediatric patients with other types of hyperlipidemia ( other than HeFH or HoFH ) .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of CRESTOR - treated patients in clinical studies , 3159 ( 31 % ) were 65 years and older , and 698 ( 6 . 8 % ) were 75 years and older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects .
Advanced age ( ≥ 65 years ) is a risk factor for CRESTOR - associated myopathy and rhabdomyolysis .
Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , recognizing the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of myopathy .
Monitor geriatric patients receiving CRESTOR for the increased risk of myopathy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Rosuvastatin exposure is not influenced by mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr ≥ 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) .
Exposure to rosuvastatin is increased to a clinically significant extent in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) who are not receiving hemodialysis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Renal impairment is a risk factor for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis .
Monitor all patients with renal impairment for development of myopathy .
In patients with severe renal impairment not on hemodialysis , the recommended starting dosage is 5 mg daily and should not exceed 10 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment CRESTOR is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis .
Chronic alcohol liver disease is known to increase rosuvastatin exposure .
Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and / or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warning and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 8 Asian Patients Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated an approximate 2 ‑ fold increase in median exposure to rosuvastatin in Asian subjects when compared with White controls .
Adjust the CRESTOR dosage in Asian patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE No specific antidotes for CRESTOR are known .
Hemodialysis does not significantly enhance clearance of rosuvastatin .
Contact Poison Control ( 1 ‑ 800 ‑ 222 ‑ 1222 ) for latest recommendations .
11 DESCRIPTION CRESTOR ( rosuvastatin ) is a 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG CoA ) - reductase inhibitor .
The chemical name for rosuvastatin calcium is bis [ ( E ) - 7 - [ 4 - ( 4 - fluorophenyl ) - 6 - isopropyl - 2 - [ methyl ( methylsulfonyl ) amino ] pyrimidin - 5 - yl ] ( 3 R , 5 S ) - 3 , 5 - dihydroxyhept - 6 - enoic acid ] calcium salt with the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The empirical formula for rosuvastatin calcium is ( C22H27FN3O6S ) 2 Ca and the molecular weight is 1001 . 14 .
Rosuvastatin calcium is a white amorphous powder that is sparingly soluble in water and methanol , and slightly soluble in ethanol .
Rosuvastatin calcium is a hydrophilic compound with a partition coefficient ( octanol / water ) of 0 . 13 at pH of 7 . 0 .
CRESTOR tablets for oral use contain rosuvastatin 5 mg , 10 mg , 20 mg , or 40 mg ( equivalent to 5 . 2 mg , 10 . 4 mg , 20 . 8 mg , and 41 . 6 mg rosuvastatin calcium ) and the following inactive ingredients : crospovidone NF , hypromellose NF , lactose monohydrate NF , magnesium stearate NF , microcrystalline cellulose NF , red ferric oxide NF , titanium dioxide USP , triacetin NF , tribasic calcium phosphate NF and yellow ferric oxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action CRESTOR is an inhibitor of HMG - CoA reductase , the rate - limiting enzyme that converts 3 ‑ hydroxy ‑ 3 ‑ methylglutaryl coenzyme A to mevalonate , a precursor of cholesterol .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Inhibition of HMG - CoA reductase by rosuvastatin accelerates the expression of LDL - receptors , followed by the uptake of LDL - C from blood to the liver , leading to a decrease in plasma LDL - C and total cholesterol .
Sustained inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in the liver also decreases levels of very - low - density lipoproteins .
The maximum LDL - C reduction of CRESTOR is usually achieved by 4 weeks and is maintained after that .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In clinical pharmacology studies in man , peak plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were reached 3 to 5 hours following oral dosing .
Both Cmax and AUC increased in approximate proportion to CRESTOR dose .
The absolute bioavailability of rosuvastatin is approximately 20 % .
The AUC of rosuvastatin does not differ following evening or morning drug administration .
Effect of food Administration of CRESTOR with food did not affect the AUC of rosuvastatin .
Distribution Mean volume of distribution at steady - state of rosuvastatin is approximately 134 liters .
Rosuvastatin is 88 % bound to plasma proteins , mostly albumin .
This binding is reversible and independent of plasma concentrations .
Elimination Metabolism Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolized ; approximately 10 % of a radiolabeled dose is recovered as metabolite .
The major metabolite is N - desmethyl rosuvastatin , which is formed principally by cytochrome P450 \ 2C9 , and in vitro studies have demonstrated that N - desmethyl rosuvastatin has approximately one - sixth to one - half the HMG ‑ CoA reductase inhibitory activity of the parent compound .
Overall , greater than 90 % of active plasma HMG ‑ CoA reductase inhibitory activity is accounted for by the parent compound .
Excretion Following oral administration , rosuvastatin and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the feces ( 90 % ) .
After an intravenous dose , approximately 28 % of total body clearance was via the renal route , and 72 % by the hepatic route .
The elimination half - life of rosuvastatin is approximately 19 hours .
Specific Populations Geriatric Patients There were no differences in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin between the nonelderly and elderly populations ( age ≥ 65 years ) .
Pediatric Patients In a population pharmacokinetic analysis of two pediatric trials involving patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia 10 to 17 years of age and 8 to 17 years of age , respectively , rosuvastatin exposure appeared comparable to or lower than rosuvastatin exposure in adult patients .
Male and Female Patients There were no differences in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin between men and women .
Racial or Ethnic Groups A population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics among Caucasian , Hispanic , and Black or Afro - Caribbean groups .
However , pharmacokinetic studies , including one conducted in the US , have demonstrated an approximate 2 ‑ fold elevation in median exposure ( AUC and Cmax ) in Asian subjects when compared with a Caucasian control group .
Patients with Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr ≥ 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) had no influence on plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin .
However , plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin increased to a clinically significant extent ( about 3 ‑ fold ) in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) not receiving hemodialysis compared with healthy subjects ( CLcr > 80 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) .
Steady - state plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin in patients on chronic hemodialysis were approximately 50 % greater compared with healthy volunteer subjects with normal renal function .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcohol liver disease , plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were modestly increased .
In patients with Child ‑ Pugh A disease , Cmax and AUC were increased by 60 % and 5 % , respectively , as compared with patients with normal liver function .
In patients with Child ‑ Pugh B disease , Cmax and AUC were increased 100 % and 21 % , respectively , compared with patients with normal liver function .
Drug Interactions Studies Rosuvastatin clearance is not dependent on metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4 to a clinically significant extent .
Rosuvastatin is a substrate for certain transporter proteins including the hepatic uptake transporter organic anion - transporting polyprotein 1B1 ( OATP1B1 ) and efflux transporter breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) .
Concomitant administration of CRESTOR with medications that are inhibitors of these transporter proteins ( e . g . cyclosporine , certain HIV protease inhibitors ) may result in increased rosuvastatin plasma concentrations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .

Higher plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin have been reported in very small groups of patients ( n = 3 to 5 ) who have two reduced function alleles of the gene that encodes OATP1B1 ( SLCO1B1 521 T > C ) .
The frequency of this genotype ( i . e . , SLCO1B1 521 C / C ) is generally lower than 5 % in most racial / ethnic groups .
The impact of this polymorphism on efficacy and / or safety of CRESTOR has not been clearly established .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a 104 - week carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 2 , 20 , 60 , or 80 mg / kg / day by oral gavage , the incidence of uterine stromal polyps was significantly increased in females at 80 mg / kg / day at systemic exposure 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC .
Increased incidence of polyps was not seen at lower doses .
In a 107 - week carcinogenicity study in mice given 10 , 60 , or 200 mg / kg / day by oral gavage , an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenoma / carcinoma was observed at 200 mg / kg / day at systemic exposures 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC .
An increased incidence of hepatocellular tumors was not seen at lower doses .
Rosuvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , the mouse lymphoma assay , and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells .
Rosuvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test .
In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 5 , 15 , 50 mg / kg / day , males were treated for 9 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating and throughout mating until gestation day 7 .
No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 50 mg / kg / day ( systemic exposures up to 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC ) .
In testicles of dogs treated with rosuvastatin at 30 mg / kg / day for one month , spermatidic giant cells were seen .
Spermatidic giant cells were observed in monkeys after 6 ‑ month treatment at 30 mg / kg / day in addition to vacuolation of seminiferous tubular epithelium .
Exposures in the dog were 20 times and in the monkey 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on body surface area .
Similar findings have been seen with other drugs in this class .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention : An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin ( JUPITER ) study , the effect of CRESTOR on the occurrence of major cardiovascular ( CV ) disease events was assessed in 17 , 802 men ( ≥ 50 years ) and women ( ≥ 60 years ) who had no clinically evident cardiovascular disease , LDL ‑ C levels < 130 mg / dL and hsCRP levels ≥ 2 mg / L .
The study population had an estimated baseline coronary heart disease risk of 11 . 6 % over 10 years based on the Framingham risk criteria and included a high percentage of patients with additional risk factors such as hypertension ( 58 % ) , low HDL ‑ C levels ( 23 % ) , cigarette smoking ( 16 % ) , or a family history of premature CHD ( 12 % ) .
Patients had a median baseline LDL ‑ C of 108 mg / dL and hsCRP of 4 . 3 mg / L .
Patients were randomly assigned to placebo ( n = 8901 ) or CRESTOR 20 mg once daily ( n = 8901 ) and were followed for a mean duration of 2 years .
The JUPITER study was stopped early by the Data Safety Monitoring Board due to meeting predefined stopping rules for efficacy in CRESTOR - treated subjects .
The primary end point was a composite end point consisting of the time - to - first occurrence of any of the following major CV events : CV death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , nonfatal stroke , hospitalization for unstable angina or an arterial revascularization procedure .
CRESTOR significantly reduced the risk of major CV events ( 252 events in the placebo group vs . 142 events in the rosuvastatin group ) with a statistically significant ( p < 0 . 001 ) relative risk reduction of 44 % and absolute risk reduction of 1 . 2 % ( see Figure 1 ) .
The risk reduction for the primary end point was consistent across the following predefined subgroups : age , sex , race , smoking status , family history of premature CHD , body mass index , LDL ‑ C , HDL ‑ C , and hsCRP levels .
Figure 1 .
Time to First Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Events in JUPITER [ MULTIMEDIA ] The individual components of the primary end point are presented in Figure 3 .
CRESTOR significantly reduced the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction , nonfatal stroke , and arterial revascularization procedures .
There were no significant treatment differences between the CRESTOR and placebo groups for death due to cardiovascular causes or hospitalizations for unstable angina .
CRESTOR significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction ( 6 fatal events and 62 nonfatal events in placebo - treated subjects vs . 9 fatal events and 22 nonfatal events in CRESTOR - treated subjects ) and the risk of stroke ( 6 fatal events and 58 nonfatal events in placebo - treated subjects vs . 3 fatal events and 30 nonfatal events in CRESTOR - treated subjects ) .
In a post - hoc subgroup analysis of JUPITER subjects ( rosuvastatin = 725 , placebo = 680 ) with a hsCRP ≥ 2 mg / L and no other traditional risk factors ( smoking , BP ≥ 140 / 90 or taking antihypertensives , low HDL ‑ C ) other than age , after adjustment for high HDL ‑ C , there was no significant treatment benefit with CRESTOR treatment .
Figure 2 .
Major CV Events by Treatment Group in JUPITER [ MULTIMEDIA ] At one year , CRESTOR increased HDL ‑ C and reduced LDL ‑ C , hsCRP , total cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels ( p < 0 . 001 for all versus placebo ) .
Primary Hyperlipidemia in Adults CRESTOR reduces Total ‑ C , LDL ‑ C , ApoB , non - HDL ‑ C , and TG , and increases HDL ‑ C , in adult patients with hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia .
In a multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled study in patients with hyperlipidemia , CRESTOR given as a single daily dose ( 5 to 40 mg ) for 6 weeks significantly reduced Total ‑ C , LDL ‑ C , non - HDL ‑ C , and ApoB , across the dose range ( Table 10 ) .

[ 2 ] CRESTOR 10 mg reduced LDL - C significantly more than atorvastatin 10 mg ; pravastatin 10 mg , 20 mg , and 40 mg ; simvastatin 10 mg , 20 mg , and 40 mg .
( p < 0 . 002 ) [ 3 ] CRESTOR 20 mg reduced LDL - C significantly more than atorvastatin 20 mg and 40 mg ; pravastatin 20 mg and 40 mg ; simvastatin 20 mg , 40 mg , and 80 mg .
( p < 0 . 002 ) [ 4 ] CRESTOR 40 mg reduced LDL - C significantly more than atorvastatin 40 mg ; pravastatin 40 mg ; simvastatin 40 mg , and 80 mg .
( p < 0 . 002 ) Slowing of the Progression of Atherosclerosis In the Measuring Effects on Intima Media Thickness : an Evaluation Of Rosuvastatin 40 mg ( METEOR ) study , the effect of therapy with CRESTOR on carotid atherosclerosis was assessed by B - mode ultrasonography in patients with elevated LDL ‑ C , at low risk ( Framingham risk < 10 % over ten years ) for symptomatic coronary artery disease and with subclinical atherosclerosis as evidenced by carotid intimal - medial thickness ( cIMT ) .
In this double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical study 984 adult patients were randomized ( of whom 876 were analyzed ) in a 5 : 2 ratio to CRESTOR 40 mg or placebo once daily .
Ultrasonograms of the carotid walls were used to determine the annualized rate of change per patient from baseline to two years in mean maximum cIMT of 12 measured segments .
The estimated difference in the rate of change in the maximum cIMT analyzed over all 12 carotid artery sites between patients treated with CRESTOR and placebo - treated patients was - 0 . 0145 mm / year ( 95 % CI – 0 . 0196 , – 0 . 0093 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .
The annualized rate of change from baseline for the placebo group was + 0 . 0131 mm / year ( p < 0 . 0001 ) .
The annualized rate of change from baseline for the group treated with CRESTOR was - 0 . 0014 mm / year ( p = 0 . 32 ) .
At an individual patient level in the group treated with CRESTOR , 52 . 1 % of patients demonstrated an absence of disease progression ( defined as a negative annualized rate of change ) , compared to 37 . 7 % of patients in the placebo group .
HeFH in Adults In a study of adult patients with HeFH ( baseline mean LDL of 291 mg / dL ) , patients were randomized to CRESTOR 20 mg or atorvastatin 20 mg .
The dose was increased at 6 - week intervals .
Significant LDL - C reductions from baseline were seen at each dose in both treatment groups ( Table 12 ) .

Patients ranged in age from 10 to 17 years ( median age of 14 years ) with approximately 30 % of the patients 10 to 13 years and approximately 17 % , 18 % , 40 % , and 25 % at Tanner stages II , III , IV , and V , respectively .
Females were at least 1 year postmenarche .
Mean LDL - C at baseline was 233 mg / dL ( range of 129 to 399 ) .
The 12 ‑ week double - blind phase was followed by a 40 week open label dose - titration phase , where all patients ( n = 173 ) received 5 mg , 10 mg or 20 mg rosuvastatin daily .
Rosuvastatin significantly reduced LDL - C ( primary end point ) , total cholesterol and ApoB levels at each dose compared to placebo .
Results are shown in Table 13 below .

All patients had a documented genetic defect in the LDL receptor or in ApoB .
Approximately 89 % were White , 7 % were Asian , 1 % were Black , and fewer than 1 % were Hispanic .
Mean LDL - C at baseline was 236 mg / dL .
Fifty - eight ( 33 % ) patients were prepubertal at baseline .
The starting rosuvastatin dosage for all children and adolescents was 5 mg once daily .
Children 8 to less than 10 years of age ( n = 41 at baseline ) could titrate to a maximum dosage of 10 mg once daily , and children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age could titrate to a maximum dosage of 20 mg once daily .
The reductions in LDL ‑ C from baseline were generally consistent across age groups within the trial as well as with previous experience in both adult and pediatric controlled trials .
HoFH in Adult and Pediatric Patients In an open - label , forced - titration study , HoFH patients ( n = 40 , 8 ‑ 63 years ) were evaluated for their response to CRESTOR 20 to 40 mg titrated at a 6 ‑ week interval .
In the overall population , the mean LDL ‑ C reduction from baseline was 22 % .
About one - third of the patients benefited from increasing their dose from 20 mg to 40 mg with further LDL - C lowering of greater than 6 % .
In the 27 patients with at least a 15 % reduction in LDL ‑ C , the mean LDL - C reduction was 30 % ( median 28 % reduction ) .
Among 13 patients with an LDL ‑ C reduction of < 15 % , 3 had no change or an increase in LDL ‑ C .
Reductions in LDL ‑ C of 15 % or greater were observed in 3 of 5 patients with known receptor negative status .
HoFH in Pediatric Patients CRESTOR was studied in a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , multicenter , cross - over study in 14 pediatric patients with HoFH .
The study included a 4 ‑ week dietary lead ‑ in phase during which patients received CRESTOR 10 mg daily , a cross ‑ over phase that included two 6 ‑ week treatment periods with either CRESTOR 20 mg or placebo in random order , followed by a 12 ‑ week open ‑ label phase during which all patients received CRESTOR 20 mg .
Patients ranged in age from 7 to 15 years of age ( median 11 years ) , 50 % were male , 71 % were White , 21 % were Asian , 7 % were Black , and no patients were of Hispanic ethnicity .
Fifty percent were on apheresis therapy and 57 % were taking ezetimibe .
Patients who entered the study on apheresis therapy or ezetimibe continued the treatment throughout the entire study .
Mean LDL ‑ C at baseline was 416 mg / dL ( range 152 to 716 mg / dL ) .
A total of 13 patients completed both treatment periods of the randomized cross - over phase ; one patient withdrew consent due to inability to have blood drawn during the cross - over phase .
CRESTOR 20 mg significantly reduced LDL - C , total cholesterol , ApoB , and non - HDL - C compared to placebo ( Table 14 ) .
