A Sugar - Free Systemic Alkalizer DESCRIPTION Sodium Citrate and Citric Acid Oral Solution USP is a stable and pleasant - tasting systemic alkalizer containing sodium citrate and citric acid in a sugar - free base .
It is a nonparticulate neutralizing buffer .
Sodium Citrate and Citric Acid Oral Solution USP contains in each teaspoonful ( 5 mL ) : SODIUM CITRATE Dihydrate 500 mg ( 0 . 34 Molar ) CITRIC ACID Monohydrate 334 mg ( 0 . 32 Molar ) Each mL contains 1 mEq sodium ion and is equivalent to 1 mEq bicarbonate ( HCO3 ) .
Sodium citrate contains the following inactive ingredients : flavoring , polyethylene glycol , propylene glycol , purified water , sodium benzoate , and sorbitol solution .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Sodium citrate is absorbed and metabolized to sodium bicarbonate , thus acting as a systemic alkalizer .
The effects are essentially those of chlorides before absorption and those of bicarbonates subsequently .
Oxidation is virtually complete so that less than 5 % of sodium citrate is excreted in the urine unchanged .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sodium Citrate and Citric Acid Oral Solution USP is an effective alkalinizing agent .
It is useful in those conditions where long - term maintenance of an alkaline urine is desirable , and is of value in the alleviation of chronic metabolic acidosis , such as results from chronic renal insufficiency or the syndrome of renal tubular acidosis , especially when the administration of potassium salts is undesirable or contraindicated .
This product is also useful for buffering and neutralizing gastric hydrochloric acid quickly and effectively .
Sodium Citrate and Citric Acid Oral Solution USP is concentrated , and when administered after meals and before bedtime , allows one to maintain an alkaline urinary pH around the clock , usually without the necessity of a 2 A . M . dose .
This product alkalinizes the urine without producing a systemic alkalosis in the recommended dosage .
This product is highly palatable , pleasant tasting , and tolerable , even when administered for long periods .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Patients on sodium - restricted diets or with severe renal impairment .
PRECAUTIONS Sodium Citrate and Citric Acid Oral Solution USP should be used with caution by patients with low urinary output unless under the supervision of a physician .
This product should not be administered concurrently with aluminum - based antacids .
Patients should be directed to dilute adequately with water and preferably , to take each dose after meals to avoid saline laxative effect .
Sodium salts should be used cautiously in patients with cardiac failure , hypertension , impaired renal function , peripheral and pulmonary edema , and toxemia of pregnancy .
Periodic examinations and determinations of serum electrolytes , particularly serum bicarbonate level , should be carried out in those patients with renal disease in order to avoid these complications .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Sodium Citrate and Citric Acid Oral Solution USP is generally well tolerated , without any unpleasant side effects , when given in recommended doses to patients with normal renal function and urinary output .
However , as with any alkalinizing agent , caution must be used in certain patients with abnormal renal mechanisms to avoid development of alkalosis , especially in the presence of hypocalcemia .
