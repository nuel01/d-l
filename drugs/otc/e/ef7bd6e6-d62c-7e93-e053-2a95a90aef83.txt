[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is an antihistamine with anticholinergic ( drying ) and sedative side effects .
Antihistamines appear to compete with histamine for cell receptor sites on effector cells .

INDICATIONS & USAGE Diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the injectable form is effective in adults and pediatric patients , other than premature infants and neonates , for the following conditions when diphenhydramine hydrochloride in the oral form is impractical .
Antihistaminic For amelioration of allergic reactions to blood or plasma , in anaphylaxis as an adjunct to epinephrine and other standard measures after the acute symptoms have been controlled , and for other uncomplicated allergic conditions of the immediate type when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated .
Motion Sickness For active treatment of motion sickness .
Antiparkinsonism For use in parkinsonism , when oral therapy is impossible or contraindicated , as follows : parkinsonism in the elderly who are unable to tolerate more potent agents ; mild cases of parkinsonism in other age groups , and in other cases of parkinsonism in combination with centrally acting anticholinergic agents .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Use in Neonates or Premature Infants This drug should not be used in neonates or premature infants .
Use in Nursing Mothers Because of the higher risk of antihistamines for infants generally , and for neonates and prematures in particular , antihistamine therapy is contraindicated in nursing mothers .
Use as a Local Anesthetic Because of the risk of local necrosis , this drug should not be used as a local anesthetic .
Antihistamines are also contraindicated in the following conditions : Hypersensitivity to diphenhydramine hydrochloride and other antihistamines of similar chemical structure .
WARNINGS Antihistamines should be used with considerable caution in patients with narrow - angle glaucoma , stenosing peptic ulcer , pyloroduodenal obstruction , symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy , or bladder - neck obstruction .
Local necrosis has been associated with the use of subcutaneous or intradermal use of intravenous diphenhydramine hydrochloride .
Use in Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients , especially , antihistamines in overdosage may cause hallucinations , convulsions , or death .
As in adults , antihistamines may diminish mental alertness in pediatric patients .
In the young pediatric patient , particularly , they may produce excitation .
Use in the Elderly ( approximately 60 years or older ) Antihistamines are more likely to cause dizziness , sedation , and hypotension in elderly patients .
PRECAUTIONS General Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has an atropine - like action and , therefore , should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma , increased intraocular pressure , hyperthyroidism , cardiovascular disease or hypertension .
Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease including asthma .
Information for Patients Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol .
Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness such as driving a car or operating appliances , machinery , etc .
Drug Interactions Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants ( hypnotics , sedatives , tranquilizers , etc . ) .
MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic ( drying ) effects of antihistamines .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed .
Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B . Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Pediatric Use Diphenhydramine hydrochloride should not be used in neonates and premature infants ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Diphenhydramine hydrochloride may diminish mental alertness , or , in the young pediatric patient , cause excitation .
