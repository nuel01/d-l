DESCRIPTION CONTENTS : Each maroon and brown soft gelatin capsule contains : Ferrous fumarate ........................................................................
200 mg ( 66 mg elemental iron ) Ascorbic acid .............................................................................. 250 mg Folic acid ........................................................................................ 1 mg Cyanocobalamin ......................................................................... 10 mcg DISCUSSION : The amount of elemental iron and the absorption of the iron components of commercial iron preparations vary widely .
It is further established that certain " accessory components " may be included to enhance absorption and utilization of iron .
Hematogen FA Capsules are formulated to provide the essential factors for a complete , versatile hematinic .
ACTIONS HIGH ELEMENTAL IRON CONTENT : Ferrous fumarate , used in Hematogen FA Capsules , is an organic iron 1 , 2 complex which has the highest elemental iron content of any hematinic salt - 33 % This compares with 20 % for ferrous sulfate ( heptahydrate ) and 13 % for ferrous gluconate .
MORE COMPLETE ABSORPTION : It has been repeatedly shown that Ascorbic acid , when given in sufficient amounts , can increase the absorption of ferrous Iron from the gastrointestinal tract .
The absorption promoting effect is mainly due to the reducing action of ascorbic acid within the gastrointestinal lumen , which helps to prevent or delay the formation of insoluble or less dissociated ferric compounds .
Iron absorption has been shown to increase sharply with increasing amounts of ascorbic acid , showing a gain in absorption of approximately 40 % at 250 mg .
Above 250 mg , the gain becomes insignificant , with an additional gain of only approximately 8 % at 500 mg .
Each Hematogen FA capsule contains 250 mg of ascorbic acid , believed to be the optimal amount PROMOTES MOVEMENT OF PLASMA IRON : Ascorbic acid also plays an important role in the movement of plasma iron to storage depots in the tissues .
The action , which leads to the transport of plasma iron to ferritin , presumably involves its reducing effect , converting transferrin iron from the ferric to the ferrous state .
There is also evidence that ascorbic acid improves iron utilization , presumably as a further result of its reducing action and some evidence that effect upon erythropoiesis .
Ascorbic acid is further alleged to enhance the conversion of folic acid to a more physiologically active form , folinic acid , which would make it even more important in the treatment of anemia since it would aid in the utilization of dietary folic acid . "
EXCELLENT ORAL TOLERATION : Ferrous fumarate is used in Hematogen FA Capsules because it is less likely to cause the gastric disturbances so often associated with oral iron therapy .
Ferrous fumarate has a low ionization constant and high solubility in the entire pH range of the gastrointestinal tract .
It does not precipitate proteins or have the astringency of more ionizable forms of iron , and does not interfere with proteolytic or diastatic activities of the digestive system .
Because of excellent oral toleration , Hematogen FA Capsules can usually be administered between meals when iron absorption is maximal .
FOLIC ACID SUPPLEMENTATION : The use of supplemental folic acid may be indicated in patients with increased requirements for this vitamin , such as iron deficiency anemia .
Folic acid administration may 12 reduce the risk of neural tube defects in the developing fetus .
Folic acid has also been shown to reduce circulating homocysteine leveIs in the blood .
FoIate as 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate and B as methylcobalamin are involved in the remethylation reaction of homocysteine to methionine .
Elevated homocysteine plasma levels are associated with increased risk of preeclampsia , neural tube defects , myocardial infarction and artherosclerosis .
TOXICITY : Ferrous fumarate was found to be the least toxic of three popular oral iron salts , with an oral LD of 630 mg / kg .
In the same report , the LD of ferrous gluconate was reported to be 320 mg / kg and ferrous sulfate 230 mg / kg .
INDICATIONS For the treatment of all anemias responsive to oral iron therapy , such as hypochromic anemia associated with pregnancy , chronic or acute blood loss , dietary restriction , metabolic disease and post - surgical convalescence .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Hemochromatosis and hemosiderosis are contraindications to iron therapy .
Folic acid is contraindicated in patients with pernicious anemia ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
WARNING WARNING : Accidental overdose of iron - containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6 years of age .
Keep this product out of reach of children .
In case of accidental overdose , call a doctor or poison control center immediately .
PRECAUTIONS Folic acid should not be prescribed until the diagnosis of pernicious anemia has been eliminated , since it can 14 alleviate the hematologic manifestations , while allowing neurological damage to continue undetected .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Average capsule doses in sensitive individuals or excessive dosage may cause nausea , skin rash , vomiting , diarrhea , precordial pain , or flushing of the face and extremities .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Usual adult dose is 1 soft gelatin capsule daily .
HOW SUPPLIED Capsules NDC 63044 - 632 - 17 , Unit Dose Box 100 CAUTION : Federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription .
