1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Eptifibatide injection is a platelet aggregation inhibitor indicated for : • • Treatment of acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) managed medically or with percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) ( 1 . 1 ) • • Treatment of patients undergoing PCI ( including intracoronary stenting ) ( 1 . 2 ) 1 . 1 Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) Eptifibatide injection is indicated to decrease the rate of a combined endpoint of death or new myocardial infarction ( MI ) in patients with ACS ( unstable angina [ UA ] / non - ST - elevation myocardial infarction [ NSTEMI ] ) , including patients who are to be managed medically and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .
1 . 2 Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) Eptifibatide injection is indicated to decrease the rate of a combined endpoint of death , new MI , or need for urgent intervention in patients undergoing PCI , including those undergoing intracoronary stenting [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 , 14 . 2 ) ] .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Eptifibatide injection in GALAXY container is for intravenous infusion only , not for intravenous bolus use .
Before infusion of eptifibatide injection , the following laboratory tests should be performed to identify pre - existing hemostatic abnormalities : hematocrit or hemoglobin , platelet count , serum creatinine , and PT / aPTT .
In patients undergoing PCI , the activated clotting time ( ACT ) should also be measured .
The activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) should be maintained between 50 and 70 seconds unless PCI is to be performed .
In patients treated with heparin , bleeding can be minimized by close monitoring of the aPTT and ACT .
Eptifibatide injection in GALAXY container is for intravenous infusion only , not for intravenous bolus use .
ACS or PCI : 180 mcg / kg IV bolus as soon as possible after diagnosis followed by infusion at 2 mcg / kg / min .
( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 ) PCI : Add a second 180 mcg / kg bolus at 10 minutes .
( 2 . 2 ) In patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL / min , reduce the infusion to 1 mcg / kg / min .

A minimum of 12 hours of infusion is recommended .
• • In patients who undergo CABG surgery , eptifibatide injection infusion should be discontinued prior to surgery .
• • Aspirin , 160 to 325 mg , should be given 1 to 24 hours prior to PCI and daily thereafter .
• • Eptifibatide injection should be given concomitantly with heparin to achieve a target ACT of 200 to 300 seconds .
Administer 60 - units / kg bolus initially in patients not treated with heparin within 6 hours prior to PCI .
• • Additional boluses during PCI to maintain ACT within target .
• • Heparin infusion after the PCI is strongly discouraged .
Patients requiring thrombolytic therapy should discontinue eptifibatide injection .
2 . 3 Important Administration Instructions • 1 .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration .
Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact .
Check for minute leaks prior to use by squeezing bag firmly .
If leaks are found , discard solution as sterility may be impaired .
If the administration port protector is damaged , detached or not present , discard the container as the solution path sterility may be compromised .
• 2 .
Do not use GALAXY containers in series connections .
Such use would result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is complete .

( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Treatment with eptifibatide is contraindicated in patients with : • • A history of bleeding diathesis , or evidence of active abnormal bleeding within the previous 30 days • • Severe hypertension ( systolic blood pressure > 200 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure > 110 mm Hg ) not adequately controlled on antihypertensive therapy • • Major surgery within the preceding 6 weeks • • History of stroke within 30 days or any history of hemorrhagic stroke • • Current or planned administration of another parenteral GP IIb / IIIa inhibitor • • Dependency on renal dialysis • • Hypersensitivity to eptifibatide or any component of the product ( hypersensitivity reactions that occurred included anaphylaxis and urticaria ) .
• • Bleeding diathesis or bleeding within the previous 30 days ( 4 ) • • Severe uncontrolled hypertension ( 4 ) • • Major surgery within the preceding 6 weeks ( 4 ) • • Stroke within 30 days or any history of hemorrhagic stroke ( 4 ) • • Coadministration of another parenteral GP IIb / IIIa inhibitor ( 4 ) • • Dependency on renal dialysis ( 4 ) • • Known hypersensitivity to any component of the product ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Eptifibatide can cause serious bleeding .
If bleeding cannot be controlled , discontinue eptifibatide immediately .
Minimize vascular and other traumas .
If heparin is given concomitantly , monitor aPTT or ACT .
( 5 . 1 ) • • Thrombocytopenia : Discontinue eptifibatide and heparin .
Monitor and treat condition appropriately .
( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Bleeding Bleeding is the most common complication encountered during eptifibatide therapy .
Administration of eptifibatide is associated with an increase in major and minor bleeding , as classified by the criteria of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Study group ( TIMI ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Most major bleeding associated with eptifibatide has been at the arterial access site for cardiac catheterization or from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract .
Minimize the use of arterial and venous punctures , intramuscular injections , and the use of urinary catheters , nasotracheal intubation , and nasogastric tubes .
When obtaining intravenous access , avoid non - compressible sites ( e . g . , subclavian or jugular veins ) .
Use of Thrombolytics , Anticoagulants , and Other Antiplatelet Agents Risk factors for bleeding include older age , a history of bleeding disorders , and concomitant use of drugs that increase the risk of bleeding ( thrombolytics , oral anticoagulants , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , and P2Y12 inhibitors ) .
Concomitant treatment with other inhibitors of platelet receptor glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb / IIIa should be avoided .
In patients treated with heparin , bleeding can be minimized by close monitoring of the aPTT and ACT [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Care of the Femoral Artery Access Site in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) In patients undergoing PCI , treatment with eptifibatide is associated with an increase in major and minor bleeding at the site of arterial sheath placement .
After PCI , eptifibatide infusion should be continued until hospital discharge or up to 18 to 24 hours , whichever comes first .
Heparin use is discouraged after the PCI procedure .
Early sheath removal is encouraged while eptifibatide is being infused .
Prior to removing the sheath , it is recommended that heparin be discontinued for 3 to 4 hours and an aPTT of < 45 seconds or ACT < 150 seconds be achieved .
In any case , both heparin and eptifibatide should be discontinued and sheath hemostasis should be achieved at least 2 to 4 hours before hospital discharge .
If bleeding at access site cannot be controlled with pressure , infusion of eptifibatide and heparin should be discontinued immediately .
5 . 2 Thrombocytopenia There have been reports of acute , profound thrombocytopenia ( immune - mediated and non - immune mediated ) with eptifibatide .
In the event of acute profound thrombocytopenia or a confirmed platelet decrease to < 100 , 000 / mm3 , discontinue eptifibatide and heparin ( unfractionated or low - molecular weight ) .
Monitor serial platelet counts , assess the presence of drug - dependent antibodies , and treat as appropriate [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
There has been no clinical experience with eptifibatide initiated in patients with a baseline platelet count < 100 , 000 / mm3 .
If a patient with low platelet counts is receiving eptifibatide , their platelet count should be monitored closely .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reaction is also discussed elsewhere in the labeling : • • Bleeding [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] Bleeding and hypotension are the most commonly reported adverse reactions .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
A total of 16 , 782 patients were treated in the Phase III clinical trials ( PURSUIT , ESPRIT , and IMPACT II ) [ see Clinical Trials ( 14 ) ] .
These 16 , 782 patients had a mean age of 62 years ( range : 20 - 94 years ) .
Eighty - nine percent of the patients were Caucasian , with the remainder being predominantly Black ( 5 % ) and Hispanic ( 5 % ) .
Sixty - eight percent were men .
Because of the different regimens used in PURSUIT , IMPACT II , and ESPRIT , data from the 3 studies were not pooled .
Bleeding and hypotension were the most commonly reported adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 5 % and greater than placebo ) in the eptifibatide controlled clinical trial database .
Bleeding The incidence of bleeding and transfusions in the PURSUIT and ESPRIT studies are shown in Table 2 .
Bleeding was classified as major or minor by the criteria of the TIMI study group .
Major bleeding consisted of intracranial hemorrhage and other bleeding that led to decreases in hemoglobin greater than 5 g / dL .
Minor bleeding included spontaneous gross hematuria , spontaneous hematemesis , other observed blood loss with a hemoglobin decrease of more than 3 g / dL , and other hemoglobin decreases that were greater than 4 g / dL but less than 5 g / dL .
In patients who received transfusions , the corresponding loss in hemoglobin was estimated through an adaptation of the method of Landefeld et al .

[ 2 ] Includes transfusions of whole blood , packed red blood cells , fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate , platelets , and autotransfusion during the initial hospitalization .
The majority of major bleeding reactions in the ESPRIT study occurred at the vascular access site ( 1 and 8 patients , or 0 . 1 % and 0 . 8 % in the placebo and eptifibatide groups , respectively ) .
Bleeding at “ other ” locations occurred in 0 . 2 % and 0 . 4 % of patients , respectively .
In the PURSUIT study , the greatest increase in major bleeding in eptifibatide - treated patients compared to placebo - treated patients was also associated with bleeding at the femoral artery access site ( 2 . 8 % versus 1 . 3 % ) .
Oropharyngeal ( primarily gingival ) , genitourinary , gastrointestinal , and retroperitoneal bleeding were also seen more commonly in eptifibatide - treated patients compared to placebo - treated patients .
Among patients experiencing a major bleed in the IMPACT II study , an increase in bleeding on eptifibatide versus placebo was observed only for the femoral artery access site ( 3 . 2 % versus 2 . 8 % ) .
Table 3 displays the incidence of TIMI major bleeding according to the cardiac procedures carried out in the PURSUIT study .
The most common bleeding complications were related to cardiac revascularization ( CABG - related or femoral artery access site bleeding ) .
A corresponding table for ESPRIT is not presented , as every patient underwent PCI in the ESPRIT study and only 11 patients underwent CABG .

In the PURSUIT and ESPRIT studies , the risk of major bleeding with eptifibatide increased as patient weight decreased .
This relationship was most apparent for patients weighing less than 70 kg .
Bleeding resulting in discontinuation of the study drug was more frequent among patients receiving eptifibatide than placebo ( 4 . 6 % versus 0 . 9 % in ESPRIT , 8 % versus 1 % in PURSUIT , 3 . 5 % versus 1 . 9 % in IMPACT II ) .
Intracranial Hemorrhage and Stroke Intracranial hemorrhage was rare in the PURSUIT , IMPACT II , and ESPRIT clinical studies .
In the PURSUIT study , 3 patients in the placebo group , 1 patient in the group treated with eptifibatide 180 / 1 . 3 , and 5 patients in the group treated with eptifibatide 180 / 2 experienced a hemorrhagic stroke .
The overall incidence of stroke was 0 . 5 % in patients receiving eptifibatide 180 / 1 . 3 , 0 . 7 % in patients receiving eptifibatide 180 / 2 , and 0 . 8 % in placebo patients .
In the IMPACT II study , intracranial hemorrhage was experienced by 1 patient treated with eptifibatide 135 / 0 . 5 , 2 patients treated with eptifibatide 135 / 0 . 75 , and 2 patients in the placebo group .
The overall incidence of stroke was 0 . 5 % in patients receiving 135 / 0 . 5 eptifibatide , 0 . 7 % in patients receiving eptifibatide 135 / 0 . 75 , and 0 . 7 % in the placebo group .
In the ESPRIT study , there were 3 hemorrhagic strokes , 1 in the placebo group and 2 in the eptifibatide group .
In addition there was 1 case of cerebral infarction in the eptifibatide group .
Immunogenicity / Thrombocytopenia The potential for development of antibodies to eptifibatide has been studied in 433 subjects .
Eptifibatide was nonantigenic in 412 patients receiving a single administration of eptifibatide ( 135 - mcg / kg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of either 0 . 5 mcg / kg / min or 0 . 75 mcg / kg / min ) , and in 21 subjects to whom eptifibatide ( 135 - mcg / kg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 0 . 75 mcg / kg / min ) was administered twice , 28 days apart .
In both cases , plasma for antibody detection was collected approximately 30 days after each dose .
The development of antibodies to eptifibatide at higher doses has not been evaluated .
In patients with suspected eptifibatide - related immune - mediated thrombocytopenia , IgG antibodies that react with the GP IIb / IIIa complex were identified in the presence of eptifibatide and in eptifibatide - naïve patients .
These findings suggest acute thrombocytopenia after the administration of eptifibatide can develop as a result of naturally occurring drug - dependent antibodies or those induced by prior exposure to eptifibatide .
Similar antibodies were identified with other GP IIb / IIIa ligand - mimetic agents .
Immune - mediated thrombocytopenia with eptifibatide may be associated with hypotension and / or other signs of hypersensitivity .
In the PURSUIT and IMPACT II studies , the incidence of thrombocytopenia ( < 100 , 000 / mm3 or ≥ 50 % reduction from baseline ) and the incidence of platelet transfusions were similar between patients treated with eptifibatide and placebo .
In the ESPRIT study , the incidence was 0 . 6 % in the placebo group and 1 . 2 % in the eptifibatide group .
Other Adverse Reactions In the PURSUIT and ESPRIT studies , the incidence of serious nonbleeding adverse reactions was similar in patients receiving placebo or eptifibatide ( 19 % and 19 % , respectively , in PURSUIT ; 6 % and 7 % , respectively , in ESPRIT ) .
In PURSUIT , the only serious nonbleeding adverse reaction that occurred at a rate of at least 1 % and was more common with eptifibatide than placebo ( 7 % versus 6 % ) was hypotension .
Most of the serious nonbleeding adverse reactions consisted of cardiovascular reactions typical of a UA population .
In the IMPACT II study , serious nonbleeding adverse reactions that occurred in greater than 1 % of patients were uncommon and similar in incidence between placebo and eptifibatide - treated patients .
Discontinuation of study drug due to adverse reactions other than bleeding was uncommon in the PURSUIT , IMPACT II , and ESPRIT studies , with no single reaction occurring in > 0 . 5 % of the study population ( except for “ other ” in the ESPRIT study ) .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Because the reactions below are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
The following adverse reactions have been reported in postmarketing experience , primarily with eptifibatide in combination with heparin and aspirin : cerebral , GI , and pulmonary hemorrhage .
Fatal bleeding reactions have been reported .
Acute profound thrombocytopenia , as well as immune - mediated thrombocytopenia , has been reported [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • • Coadministration of antiplatelet agents , thrombolytics , heparin , aspirin , and chronic NSAID use increases the risk of bleeding .
Avoid concomitant use with other glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb / IIIa inhibitors .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Use of Thrombolytics , Anticoagulants , and Other Antiplatelet Agents Coadministration of antiplatelet agents , thrombolytics , heparin , aspirin , and chronic NSAID use increases the risk of bleeding .
Concomitant treatment with other inhibitors of platelet receptor GP IIb / IIIa should be avoided .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Geriatric Use : Risk of bleeding increases with age .
( 8 . 5 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Teratology studies have been performed by continuous intravenous infusion of eptifibatide in pregnant rats at total daily doses of up to 72 mg / kg / day ( about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis ) and in pregnant rabbits at total daily doses of up to 36 mg / kg / day ( also about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis ) .
These studies revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to eptifibatide .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women with eptifibatide .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , eptifibatide should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether eptifibatide is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when eptifibatide is administered to a nursing mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of eptifibatide in pediatric patients have not been studied .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use The PURSUIT and IMPACT II clinical studies enrolled patients up to the age of 94 years ( 45 % were age 65 and over ; 12 % were age 75 and older ) .
There was no apparent difference in efficacy between older and younger patients treated with eptifibatide .
The incidence of bleeding complications was higher in the elderly in both placebo and eptifibatide groups , and the incremental risk of eptifibatide - associated bleeding was greater in the older patients .
No dose adjustment was made for elderly patients , but patients over 75 years of age had to weigh at least 50 kg to be enrolled in the PURSUIT study ; no such limitation was stipulated in the ESPRIT study [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Approximately 50 % of eptifibatide is cleared by the kidney in patients with normal renal function .
Total drug clearance is decreased by approximately 50 % and steady - state plasma eptifibatide concentrations are doubled in patients with an estimated CrCl < 50 mL / min ( using the Cockcroft - Gault equation ) .
Therefore , the infusion dose should be reduced to 1 mcg / kg / min in such patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
The safety and efficacy of eptifibatide in patients dependent on dialysis has not been established .
10 OVERDOSAGE There has been only limited experience with overdosage of eptifibatide .
There were 8 patients in the IMPACT II study , 9 patients in the PURSUIT study , and no patients in the ESPRIT study who received bolus doses and / or infusion doses more than double those called for in the protocols .
None of these patients experienced an intracranial bleed or other major bleeding .
Eptifibatide was not lethal to rats , rabbits , or monkeys when administered by continuous intravenous infusion for 90 minutes at a total dose of 45 mg / kg ( about 2 to 5 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis ) .
Symptoms of acute toxicity were loss of righting reflex , dyspnea , ptosis , and decreased muscle tone in rabbits and petechial hemorrhages in the femoral and abdominal areas of monkeys .
From in vitro studies , eptifibatide is not extensively bound to plasma proteins and thus may be cleared from plasma by dialysis .
11 DESCRIPTION Eptifibatide is a cyclic heptapeptide containing 6 amino acids and 1 mercaptopropionyl ( des - amino cysteinyl ) residue .
An interchain disulfide bridge is formed between the cysteine amide and the mercaptopropionyl moieties .
Chemically it is N6 - ( aminoiminomethyl ) - N2 - ( 3 - mercapto - 1 - oxopropyl ) - L - lysylglycyl - L - α - aspartyl - L - tryptophyl - L - prolyl - L - cysteinamide , cyclic ( 1 → 6 ) - disulfide .
Eptifibatide binds to the platelet receptor glycoprotein ( GP ) IIb / IIIa of human platelets and inhibits platelet aggregation .
The eptifibatide peptide is produced by solution - phase peptide synthesis , and is purified by preparative reverse - phase liquid chromatography and lyophilized .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Eptifibatide Injection is a clear , colorless , sterile , non - pyrogenic solution for intravenous infusion with an empirical formula of C35H49N11O9S2 and a molecular weight of 831 . 96 .
Eptifibatide injection is a refrigerated , premixed , sterile , non - pyrogenic single - dose solution packaged in the GALAXY container ( PL 2501 plastic ) .
The 100 mL container consists of 0 . 75 mg / mL of eptifibatide .
The container also contains 5 . 25 mg / mL citric acid and sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH to 5 . 35 .
The GALAXY container is fabricated from a specially designed multilayered plastic ( PL 2501 ) .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period .
The suitability of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to the USP biological tests for plastic containers , as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Eptifibatide reversibly inhibits platelet aggregation by preventing the binding of fibrinogen , von Willebrand factor , and other adhesive ligands to GP IIb / IIIa .
When administered intravenously , eptifibatide inhibits ex vivo platelet aggregation in a dose - and concentration - dependent manner .
Platelet aggregation inhibition is reversible following cessation of the eptifibatide infusion ; this is thought to result from dissociation of eptifibatide from the platelet .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Infusion of eptifibatide into baboons caused a dose - dependent inhibition of ex vivo platelet aggregation , with complete inhibition of aggregation achieved at infusion rates greater than 5 mcg / kg / min .
In a baboon model that is refractory to aspirin and heparin , doses of eptifibatide that inhibit aggregation prevented acute thrombosis with only a modest prolongation ( 2 - to 3 - fold ) of the bleeding time .
Platelet aggregation in dogs was also inhibited by infusions of eptifibatide , with complete inhibition at 2 mcg / kg / min .
This infusion dose completely inhibited canine coronary thrombosis induced by coronary artery injury ( Folts model ) .
Human pharmacodynamic data were obtained in healthy subjects and in patients presenting with UA or NSTEMI and / or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention .
Studies in healthy subjects enrolled only males ; patient studies enrolled approximately one - third women .
In these studies , eptifibatide inhibited ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) and other agonists in a dose - and concentration - dependent manner .
The effect of eptifibatide was observed immediately after administration of a 180 - mcg / kg intravenous bolus .
Table 4 shows the effects of dosing regimens of eptifibatide used in the IMPACT II and PURSUIT studies on ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by 20 µM ADP in PPACK - anticoagulated platelet - rich plasma and on bleeding time .
The effects of the dosing regimen used in ESPRIT on platelet aggregation have not been studied .

The eptifibatide dosing regimen used in the ESPRIT study included two 180 - mcg / kg bolus doses given 10 minutes apart combined with a continuous 2 - mcg / kg / min infusion .
When administered alone , eptifibatide has no measurable effect on PT or aPTT .
There were no important differences between men and women or between age groups in the pharmacodynamic properties of eptifibatide .
Differences among ethnic groups have not been assessed .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of eptifibatide are linear and dose - proportional for bolus doses ranging from 90 to 250 mcg / kg and infusion rates from 0 . 5 to 3 mcg / kg / min .
Plasma elimination half - life is approximately 2 . 5 hours .
Administration of a single 180 - mcg / kg bolus combined with an infusion produces an early peak level , followed by a small decline prior to attaining steady state ( within 4 - 6 hours ) .
This decline can be prevented by administering a second 180 - mcg / kg bolus 10 minutes after the first .
The extent of eptifibatide binding to human plasma protein is about 25 % .
Clearance in patients with coronary artery disease is about 55 mL / kg / h .
In healthy subjects , renal clearance accounts for approximately 50 % of total body clearance , with the majority of the drug excreted in the urine as eptifibatide , deaminated eptifibatide , and other , more polar metabolites .
No major metabolites have been detected in human plasma .
Special Populations Geriatric Patients in clinical studies were older ( range : 20 - 94 years ) than those in the clinical pharmacology studies .
Elderly patients with coronary artery disease demonstrated higher plasma levels and lower total body clearance of eptifibatide when given the same dose as younger patients .
Limited data are available on lighter weight ( < 50 kg ) patients over 75 years of age .
Renal Impairment In patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency ( CrCl < 50 mL / min using the Cockcroft - Gault equation ) , the clearance of eptifibatide is reduced by approximately 50 % and steady - state plasma levels approximately doubled [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Hepatic Impairment No studies have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment .
Gender Males and females have not demonstrated any clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of eptifibatide .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No long - term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of eptifibatide .
Eptifibatide was not genotoxic in the Ames test , the mouse lymphoma cell ( L 5178 Y , TK + / - ) forward mutation test , the human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test , or the mouse micronucleus test .
Administered by continuous intravenous infusion at total daily doses up to 72 mg / kg / day ( about 4 times the recommended maximum daily human dose on a body surface area basis ) , eptifibatide had no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Eptifibatide was studied in 3 placebo - controlled , randomized studies .
PURSUIT evaluated patients with acute coronary syndromes : UA or NSTEMI .
Two other studies , ESPRIT and IMPACT II , evaluated patients about to undergo a PCI .
Patients underwent primarily balloon angioplasty in IMPACT II and intracoronary stent placement , with or without angioplasty , in ESPRIT .
14 . 1 Non - ST - Segment Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome Non - ST - segment elevation acute coronary syndrome is defined as prolonged ( ≥ 10 minutes ) symptoms of cardiac ischemia within the previous 24 hours associated with either ST - segment changes ( elevations between 0 . 6 mm and 1 mm or depression > 0 . 5 mm ) , T - wave inversion ( > 1 mm ) , or positive CK - MB .
This definition includes " unstable angina " and " NSTEMI " but excludes MI that is associated with Q waves or greater degrees of ST - segment elevation .
PURSUIT ( Platelet Glycoprotein IIb / IIIa in Unstable Angina : Receptor Suppression Using Eptifibatide Therapy ) PURSUIT was a 726 - center , 27 - country , double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled study in 10 , 948 patients presenting with UA or NSTEMI .
Patients could be enrolled only if they had experienced cardiac ischemia at rest ( ≥ 10 minutes ) within the previous 24 hours and had either ST - segment changes ( elevations between 0 . 6 mm and 1 mm or depression > 0 . 5 mm ) , T - wave inversion ( > 1 mm ) , or increased CK - MB .
Important exclusion criteria included a history of bleeding diathesis , evidence of abnormal bleeding within the previous 30 days , uncontrolled hypertension , major surgery within the previous 6 weeks , stroke within the previous 30 days , any history of hemorrhagic stroke , serum creatinine > 2 mg / dL , dependency on renal dialysis , or platelet count < 100 , 000 / mm3 .
Patients were randomized to placebo , to eptifibatide 180 - mcg / kg bolus followed by a 2 - mcg / kg / min infusion ( 180 / 2 ) , or to eptifibatide 180 - mcg / kg bolus followed by a 1 . 3 - mcg / kg / min infusion ( 180 / 1 . 3 ) .
The infusion was continued for 72 hours , until hospital discharge , or until the time of CABG , whichever occurred first , except that if PCI was performed , the eptifibatide infusion was continued for 24 hours after the procedure , allowing for a duration of infusion up to 96 hours .
The lower - infusion - rate arm was stopped after the first interim analysis when the 2 active - treatment arms appeared to have the same incidence of bleeding .
Patient age ranged from 20 to 94 ( mean 63 ) years , and 65 % were male .
The patients were 89 % Caucasian , 6 % Hispanic , and 5 % Black , recruited in the United States and Canada ( 40 % ) , Western Europe ( 39 % ) , Eastern Europe ( 16 % ) , and Latin America ( 5 % ) .
This was a “ real world ” study ; each patient was managed according to the usual standards of the investigational site ; frequencies of angiography , PCI , and CABG therefore differed widely from site to site and from country to country .
Of the patients in PURSUIT , 13 % were managed with PCI during drug infusion , of whom 50 % received intracoronary stents ; 87 % were managed medically ( without PCI during drug infusion ) .
The majority of patients received aspirin ( 75 - 325 mg once daily ) .
Heparin was administered intravenously or subcutaneously , at the physician ' s discretion , most commonly as an intravenous bolus of 5000 units followed by a continuous infusion of 1000 units / h .
For patients weighing less than 70 kg , the recommended heparin bolus dose was 60 units / kg followed by a continuous infusion of 12 units / kg / h .
A target aPTT of 50 to 70 seconds was recommended .
A total of 1250 patients underwent PCI within 72 hours after randomization , in which case they received intravenous heparin to maintain an ACT of 300 to 350 seconds .
The primary endpoint of the study was the occurrence of death from any cause or new MI ( evaluated by a blinded Clinical Endpoints Committee ) within 30 days of randomization .
Compared to placebo , eptifibatide administered as a 180 - mcg / kg bolus followed by a 2 - mcg / kg / min infusion significantly ( p = 0 . 042 ) reduced the incidence of endpoint events ( see Table 6 ) .
The reduction in the incidence of endpoint events in patients receiving eptifibatide was evident early during treatment , and this reduction was maintained through at least 30 days ( see Figure 1 ) .
Table 5 also shows the incidence of the components of the primary endpoint , death ( whether or not preceded by an MI ) and new MI in surviving patients at 30 days .

Table 6 shows the incidence of death or MI within 72 hours .
Table 6 : Clinical Events ( Death or MI ) in the PURSUIT Study Within 72 Hours of Randomization Placebo Eptifibatide ( 180 mcg / kg bolus then then 2 mcg / kg / min infusion ) Overall patient population – At 72 hours Patients undergoing early PCI – Pre - procedure ( nonfatal MI only ) – At 72 hours Patients not undergoing early PCI – At 72 hours n = 4739 7 . 6 % n = 631 5 . 5 % 14 . 4 % n = 4108 6 . 5 % n = 4722 5 . 9 % n = 619 1 . 8 % 9 % n = 4103 5 . 4 % All of the effect of eptifibatide was established within 72 hours ( during the period of drug infusion ) , regardless of management strategy .
Moreover , for patients undergoing early PCI , a reduction in events was evident prior to the procedure .
An analysis of the results by sex suggests that women who would not routinely be expected to undergo PCI receive less benefit from eptifibatide ( 95 % confidence limits for relative risk of 0 . 94 - 1 . 28 ) than do men ( 0 . 72 - 0 . 9 ) .
This difference may be a true treatment difference , the effect of other differences in these subgroups , or a statistical anomaly .
No differential outcomes were seen between male and female patients undergoing PCI ( see results for ESPRIT ) .
Follow - up data were available through 165 days for 10 , 611 patients enrolled in the PURSUIT trial ( 96 . 9 % of the initial enrollment ) .
This follow - up included 4566 patients who received eptifibatide at the 180 / 2 dose .
As reported by the investigators , the occurrence of death from any cause or new MI for patients followed for at least 165 days was reduced from 13 . 6 % with placebo to 12 . 1 % with eptifibatide 180 / 2 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) IMPACT II ( Eptifibatide to Minimize Platelet Aggregation and Prevent Coronary Thrombosis II ) IMPACT II was a multicenter , double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled study conducted in the United States in 4010 patients undergoing PCI .
Major exclusion criteria included a history of bleeding diathesis , major surgery within 6 weeks of treatment , gastrointestinal bleeding within 30 days , any stroke or structural CNS abnormality , uncontrolled hypertension , PT > 1 . 2 times control , hematocrit < 30 % , platelet count < 100 , 000 / mm3 , and pregnancy .
Patient age ranged from 24 to 89 ( mean 60 ) years , and 75 % were male .
The patients were 92 % Caucasian , 5 % Black , and 3 % Hispanic .
Forty - one percent of the patients underwent PCI for ongoing ACS .
Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment regimens , each incorporating a bolus dose initiated immediately prior to PCI followed by a continuous infusion lasting 20 to 24 hours : • 1 ) 135 - mcg / kg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 0 . 5 mcg / kg / min of eptifibatide ( 135 / 0 . 5 ) ; • 2 ) 135 - mcg / kg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 0 . 75 mcg / kg / min of eptifibatide ( 135 / 0 . 75 ) ; or • 3 ) a matching placebo bolus followed by a matching placebo continuous infusion .
Each patient received aspirin and an intravenous heparin bolus of 100 units / kg , with additional bolus infusions of up to 2000 additional units of heparin every 15 minutes to maintain an ACT of 300 to 350 seconds .
The primary endpoint was the composite of death , MI , or urgent revascularization , analyzed at 30 days after randomization in all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug .
As shown in Table 7 , each eptifibatide regimen reduced the rate of death , MI , or urgent intervention , although at 30 days , this finding was statistically significant only in the lower - dose eptifibatide group .
As in the PURSUIT study , the effects of eptifibatide were seen early and persisted throughout the 30 - day period .

ESPRIT ( Enhanced Suppression of the Platelet IIb / IIIa Receptor with Eptifibatide Therapy ) The ESPRIT study was a multicenter , double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled study conducted in the United States and Canada that enrolled 2064 patients undergoing elective or urgent PCI with intended intracoronary stent placement .
Exclusion criteria included MI within the previous 24 hours , ongoing chest pain , administration of any oral antiplatelet or oral anticoagulant other than aspirin within 30 days of PCI ( although loading doses of thienopyridine on the day of PCI were encouraged ) , planned PCI of a saphenous vein graft or subsequent “ staged ” PCI , prior stent placement in the target lesion , PCI within the previous 90 days , a history of bleeding diathesis , major surgery within 6 weeks of treatment , gastrointestinal bleeding within 30 days , any stroke or structural CNS abnormality , uncontrolled hypertension , PT > 1 . 2 times control , hematocrit < 30 % , platelet count < 100 , 000 / mm3 , and pregnancy .
Patient age ranged from 24 to 93 ( mean 62 ) years , and 73 % of patients were male .
The study enrolled 90 % Caucasian , 5 % African American , 2 % Hispanic , and 1 % Asian patients .
Patients received a wide variety of stents .
Patients were randomized either to placebo or eptifibatide administered as an intravenous bolus of 180 mcg / kg followed immediately by a continuous infusion of 2 mcg / kg / min , and a second bolus of 180 mcg / kg administered 10 minutes later ( 180 / 2 / 180 ) .
Eptifibatide infusion was continued for 18 to 24 hours after PCI or until hospital discharge , whichever came first .
Each patient received at least 1 dose of aspirin ( 162 - 325 mg ) and 60 units / kg of heparin as a bolus ( not to exceed 6000 units ) if not already receiving a heparin infusion .
Additional boluses of heparin ( 10 - 40 units / kg ) could be administered in order to reach a target ACT between 200 and 300 seconds .
The primary endpoint of the ESPRIT study was the composite of death , MI , urgent target vessel revascularization ( UTVR ) , and “ bailout ” to open - label eptifibatide due to a thrombotic complication of PCI ( TBO ) ( e . g . , visible thrombus , “ no reflow , ” or abrupt closure ) at 48 hours .
MI , UTVR , and TBO were evaluated by a blinded Clinical Events Committee .
As shown in Table 8 , the incidence of the primary endpoint and selected secondary endpoints was significantly reduced in patients who received eptifibatide .
A treatment benefit in patients who received eptifibatide was seen by 48 hours and at the end of the 30 - day observation period .
Table 8 : Clinical Events in the ESPRIT Study * Eptifibatide was administered as 180 mcg / kg boluses at times 0 and 10 minutes and an infusion at 2 mcg / kg / min .

Consistent with previous studies of GP IIb / IIIa inhibitors , most of the benefit achieved acutely with eptifibatide was in the reduction of MI .
Eptifibatide reduced the occurrence of MI at 48 hours from 9 % for placebo to 5 . 4 % ( p = 0 . 0015 ) and maintained that effect with significance at 30 days .
There was no treatment difference with respect to sex in ESPRIT .
Eptifibatide reduced the incidence of the primary endpoint in both men ( 95 % confidence limits for relative risk : 0 . 54 , 1 . 07 ) and women ( 0 . 24 , 0 . 72 ) at 48 hours .
Follow - up ( 12 - month ) mortality data were available for 2024 patients ( 1017 on eptifibatide ) enrolled in the ESPRIT trial ( 98 . 1 % of the initial enrollment ) .
Twelve - month clinical event data were available for 1964 patients ( 988 on eptifibatide ) , representing 95 . 2 % of the initial enrollment .
As shown in Table 9 , the treatment effect of eptifibatide seen at 48 hours and 30 days appeared preserved at 6 months and 1 year .
Most of the benefit was in reduction of MI .
