2 . 3 Instructions for Use [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 2 . 4 Dosing Considerations The dosage of PERIKABIVEN ® should be individualized based on the patient ’ s clinical condition ( ability to adequately metabolize amino acids , dextrose and lipids ) , body weight and nutritional / fluid requirements , as well as additional energy given orally / enterally to the patient .
PERIKABIVEN ® is a combination of amino acids , electrolytes , dextrose , and lipids in a fixed volume and concentration .
The dosage selection is based upon fluid requirements which can be used in conjunction with the nutritional requirements to determine final dosage [ see Table 1 ] .
PERIKABIVEN ® meets the total nutritional requirements for protein , dextrose and lipids in stable patients , and can be individualized to meet specific needs with the addition of nutrients .
The maximum infusion rate is based upon the dextrose component .
Prior to administration of PERIKABIVEN ® , correct severe fluid , electrolyte and acid - base disorders .
Before starting the infusion , obtain serum triglyceride levels to establish the baseline value .
Recommended Adult Dosage The recommended dosage of PERIKABIVEN ® in adults is 27 to 40 mL / kg / day .
The recommended daily nutritional requirements for protein , dextrose and lipids compared to the amount of nutrition provided by PERIKABIVEN ® are shown in Table 1 .
The maximum daily dosage of PERIKABIVEN ® in adults should not exceed 40 mL / kg / day .
In patients with serum triglyceride concentrations above 400 mg / dL , stop the PERIKABIVEN ® infusion and monitor serum triglyceride levels .
Once the triglycerides are < 400 mg / dL , restart PERIKABIVEN ® at a lower infusion rate and advance rate in smaller increments towards target dosage , checking the triglyceride levels prior to each adjustment [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 12 ) ] .

** Protein is provided as amino acids .
When infused intravenously amino acids are metabolized and utilized as the building blocks of protein .
Treatment with PERIKABIVEN ® may be continued for as long as is required by the patient ’ s condition .
Dosing in Renal Impairment In patients with renal impairment , the dosage of PERIKABIVEN ® should be the recommended adult dosage ( see above ) .
Prior to administration , correct severe fluid or electrolyte imbalances .
Closely monitor serum electrolyte levels and adjust the volume of PERIKABIVEN ® administered as required [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) ] .
Renal patients not needing dialysis require 0 . 6 to 0 . 8 g of protein / kg / day .
Patients on dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy should receive 1 . 2 to 1 . 8 g of protein / kg / day up to a maximum of 2 . 5 g of protein / kg / day based on nutritional status and estimated protein losses2 .
The PERIKABIVEN ® dosage can be adjusted based on the treatment for the renal impairment , supplementing protein as indicated .
Additional protein may be added to PERIKABIVEN ® bag or infused separately .
If required , additional amino acids may be added to the PERIKABIVEN ® bag or infused separately .
Compatibility of additions should be evaluated by a pharmacist and questions may be directed to Fresenius Kabi USA , LLC .
Infusion Duration and Rate The recommended duration of infusion for PERIKABIVEN ® is between 12 and 24 hours , depending on the clinical situation .
The maximum infusion rate of PERIKABIVEN ® is 3 . 7 mL / kg / hour .
This corresponds to 0 . 09 g / kg / hour of amino acids , 0 . 25 g / kg / hour of dextrose ( the rate limiting factor ) and 0 . 13 g / kg / hour of lipid .
Dosing Instructions • Determine the fluid requirements ( 27 to 40 mL / kg / day ) and the patient ’ s nutritional requirements ( see Table 1 ) to be delivered , then select the corresponding PERIKABIVEN ® bag .
• Determine the preferred duration of infusion ( 12 to 24 hours ) .
• Ensure that the rate of infusion ( PERIKABIVEN ® dosage in mL / kg / day divided by the preferred duration of infusion ( hours ) does not exceed the maximum infusion rate for the patient ( i . e . , 3 . 7 mL / kg / hour ) .
The infusion rate may need to be reduced and duration of infusion increased in order not to exceed the maximum infusion rate .
• Once the infusion rate in mL / kg / hour has been selected , calculate the infusion rate ( mL / hour ) using the patient ’ s weight .
• Compare the patient ’ s nutrient requirements with the amount supplied by PERIKABIVEN ® .
Discuss with a pharmacist any additions that may be required .

( 3 ) • PERIKABIVEN ® is available in three sizes 2 , 400 mL , 1 , 920 mL , and 1 , 440 mL .
( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of PERIKABIVEN ® is contraindicated in patients with the following : • Known hypersensitivity to egg , soybean proteins , peanut proteins , corn or corn products or to any of the active substances or excipients • Severe hyperlipidemia or severe disorders of lipid metabolism characterized by hypertriglyceridemia ( serum triglyceride concentration > 1 , 000 g / dL ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 12 ) ] • Inborn error of amino acid metabolism • Cardiopulmonary instability ( including pulmonary edema , cardiac insufficiency , myocardial infarction , acidosis and hemodynamic instability requiring significant vasopressor support ) • Hemophagocytic syndrome • Known hypersensitivity to egg , soybean proteins , peanut proteins , corn or corn products , or to any of the active substances or excipients ( 4 ) • Severe hyperlipidemia or severe disorders of lipid metabolism with serum triglycerides > 1 , 000 mg / dL ( 4 , 5 . 12 ) • Inborn errors of amino acid metabolism ( 4 ) • Cardiopulmonary instability ( 4 ) • Hemophagocytic syndrome ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypersensitivity reactions : Monitor for signs or symptoms and discontinue infusion if reactions occur .
( 5 . 2 ) • Infection , fat overload , hyperglycemia and refeeding complications : Monitor for signs and symptoms ; monitor laboratory parameters .
( 5 . 3 , 5 . 4 , 5 . 5 , 5 . 6 , 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Death in Preterm Infants Deaths in preterm infants after infusion of intravenous lipid emulsions have been reported .
Autopsy findings included intravascular lipid accumulation in the lungs .
Preterm and small for gestational age infants have poor clearance of intravenous lipid emulsion and increased free fatty acid plasma levels following lipid emulsion infusion .
The safe and effective use of PERIKABIVEN ® injection in pediatric patients , including preterm infants , has not been established .
PERIKABIVEN ® is not recommended for use in pediatric patients under the age of 2 years including preterm infants .
5 . 2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Stop infusion immediately and treat patient accordingly if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity or allergic reaction develop .
Signs or symptoms may include : tachypnea , dyspnea , hypoxia , bronchospasm , tachycardia , hypotension , cyanosis , vomiting , nausea , headache , sweating , dizziness , altered mentation , flushing , rash , urticaria , erythema , pyrexia and chills .
5 . 3 Infections Patients who require parenteral nutrition are at high risk of infections due to malnutrition and their underlying disease state .
Infection and sepsis may occur as a result of the use of intravenous catheters to administer parenteral nutrition , poor maintenance of catheters , or immunosuppressive effects of illness , drugs , and parenteral formulations .
Decrease the risk of septic complications with heightened emphasis on aseptic technique in catheter placement and maintenance , as well as aseptic technique in the preparation of the nutritional formula .
Monitor for signs and symptoms ( including fever and chills ) of early infections , including laboratory test results ( including leukocytosis and hyperglycemia ) and frequent checks of the parenteral access device .
5 . 4 Fat Overload Syndrome Fat overload syndrome is a rare condition that has been reported with intravenous lipid formulations .
A reduced or limited ability to metabolize the lipid contained in PERIKABIVEN ® accompanied by prolonged plasma clearance may result in a syndrome characterized by a sudden deterioration in the patient ' s condition accompanied by fever , anemia , leukopenia , thrombocytopenia , coagulation disorders , hyperlipidemia , liver fatty infiltration ( hepatomegaly ) , deteriorating liver function , and central nervous system manifestations ( e . g . , coma ) .
The cause of the fat overload syndrome is unclear .
The syndrome is usually reversible when the infusion of the lipid emulsion is stopped .
Although it has been most frequently observed when the recommended lipid dosage was exceeded , cases have also been described where the lipid formulation was administered according to instructions .
5 . 5 Refeeding Syndrome Refeeding severely undernourished patients with parenteral nutrition may result in the refeeding syndrome , characterized by the intracellular shift of potassium , phosphorus , and magnesium as the patient becomes anabolic .
Thiamine deficiency and fluid retention may also develop .
Carefully monitor severely undernourished patients and slowly increase their nutrient intakes , while avoiding overfeeding , to prevent these complications .
5 . 6 Diabetes / Hyperglycemia PERIKABIVEN ® should be used with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia .
With the administration of PERIKABIVEN ® , hyperglycemia and hyperosmolar syndrome may result .
Administration of dextrose at a rate exceeding the patient ' s utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia , coma and death .
Monitor blood glucose levels and treat hyperglycemia to maintain optimum levels while infusing PERIKABIVEN ® .
Insulin may be administered or adjusted to maintain optimal blood glucose levels during PERIKABIVEN ® administration .
5 . 7 Monitoring / Laboratory Tests Routine Monitoring • Frequent clinical evaluation and laboratory determinations are necessary for proper monitoring during administration .
• Monitor fluid status closely in patients with heart failure or pulmonary edema .
• Monitor serum triglycerides , fluid and electrolyte status , serum osmolarity , blood glucose , liver and kidney function , and blood count , including platelet and coagulation parameters , throughout treatment .
In situations of severely elevated electrolyte levels stop PERIKABIVEN ® until levels have been corrected .
Essential Fatty Acids Monitoring patients for signs and symptoms of essential fatty acid deficiency ( EFAD ) is recommended .
Laboratory tests are available to determine serum fatty acids levels .
Reference values should be consulted to help determine adequacy of essential fatty acid status .
Increasing essential fatty acid intake ( enterally or parenterally ) is effective in treating and preventing EFAD .
In PERIKABIVEN ® , the mean composition of linoleic acid ( an omega - 6 essential fatty acid ) is 19 mg / mL ( range 17 to 20 mg / mL ) and alpha - linolenic acid ( an omega - 3 essential fatty acid ) is 2 . 3 mg / mL ( range 1 . 8 to 3 . 8 mg / mL ) .
There are insufficient long - term data to determine whether PERIKABIVEN ® can supply essential fatty acids in adequate amounts in patients who may have increased requirements .
5 . 8 Thrombophlebitis PERIKABIVEN ® is indicated for peripheral administration , or may be infused into a central vein .
Peripheral catheters should not be used for solutions with osmolarity of ≥ 900 mOsm / L .
The primary complication of peripheral access is venous thrombophlebitis , which manifests as pain , erythema , tenderness or a palpable cord .
The catheter should be removed as soon as thrombophlebitis develops .
5 . 9 Precipitation with Ceftriaxone Precipitation of ceftriaxone - calcium can occur when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium - containing parenteral nutrition solutions , such as PERIKABIVEN ® in the same intravenous administration line .
Ceftriaxone must not be administered simultaneously with PERIKABIVEN ® via a Y - site .
However , ceftriaxone and PERIKABIVEN ® may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 10 Hepatobiliary Disorders Hepatobiliary disorders are known to develop in some patients without preexisting liver disease who receive parenteral nutrition , including cholecystitis , cholelithiasis , cholestasis , hepatic steatosis , fibrosis and cirrhosis , possibly leading to hepatic failure .
The etiology of these disorders is thought to be multifactorial and may differ between patients .
Increase of blood ammonia levels and hyperammonemia may occur in patients receiving amino acid solutions .
In some patients this may indicate hepatic insufficiency or the presence of an inborn error of amino acid metabolism [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] or hepatic insufficiency .
Monitor liver function parameters and ammonia .
Patients developing signs of hepatobiliary disorders should be assessed early by a clinician knowledgeable in liver diseases in order to identify causative and contributory factors , and possible therapeutic and prophylactic interventions .
5 . 11 Electrolyte Imbalance and Fluid Overload in Renal Impairment Patients with renal impairment , such as pre - renal azotemia , renal obstruction and protein - losing nephropathy may be at increased risk of electrolyte and fluid volume imbalance .
PERIKABIVEN ® should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment .
PERIKABIVEN ® dosage may require adjustment with specific attention to fluid , protein and electrolyte content in these patients .
Monitor renal function parameters .
Patients developing signs of renal impairment should be assessed early by a clinician knowledgeable in renal disease in order to determine the appropriate PERIKABIVEN ® dosage and other treatment options .
5 . 12 Hypertriglyceridemia To evaluate the patient ’ s capacity to eliminate and metabolize the infused lipid emulsion , measure serum triglycerides before the start of infusion ( baseline value ) , with each increase in dosage , and regularly throughout treatment .
Reduce dose of PERIKABIVEN ® and monitor serum triglyceride levels in patients with serum triglyceride concentrations above 400 mg / dL to avoid the clinical consequences associated with hypertriglyceridemia .
Serum triglyceride levels above 1 , 000 mg / dL have been associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis .
Impaired lipid metabolism with hypertriglyceridemia may occur in conditions such as inherited lipid disorders , obesity , diabetes mellitus , and metabolic syndrome .
In these cases , increased triglycerides can also be increased by dextrose and / or overfeeding .
Monitor overall energy intake and other sources of lipid and dextrose , as well as drugs that may interfere with lipid and dextrose metabolism .
5 . 13 Aluminum Toxicity PERIKABIVEN ® contains no more than 25 mcg / L of aluminum .
The aluminum contained in PERIKABIVEN ® may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration in patients with impaired kidney function .
Preterm infants are at greater risk because their kidneys are immature , and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions that contain aluminum .
Patients with impaired kidney function , including preterm infants , who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg / kg / day , accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity .
Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration of total parenteral nutrition products .
5 . 14 Interference with Laboratory Tests High levels of lipids in plasma may interfere with some laboratory blood tests such as hemoglobin , triglycerides , bilirubin , LDH , and oxygen saturation , if blood is sampled before lipid has been cleared from the bloodstream .
Lipids are normally cleared after a lipid - free interval of 5 to 6 hours in most patients .
PERIKABIVEN ® contains Vitamin K1 which may interfere with anticoagulant activity [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 15 Risk of Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease Parenteral Nutrition Associated Liver Disease ( PNALD ) has been reported in patients who receive parenteral nutrition for extended periods of time , especially preterm infants , and can present as cholestasis or steatohepatitis .
The exact etiology is unknown and is likely multifactorial .
Intravenously administered phytosterols ( plant sterols ) contained in plant - derived lipid formulations have been associated with development of PNALD although a causal relationship has not been established .
If PERIKABIVEN ® treated patients develop liver test abnormalities consider discontinuation or dosage reduction .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the prescribing information .
• Hypersensitivity Reactions [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Infections [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Fat Overload Syndrome [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Refeeding Syndrome [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Diabetes / Hyperglycemia [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Thrombophlebitis [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] • Hepatobiliary Disorders [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 , 5 . 15 ) ] • Electrolyte Imbalance and Fluid Overload in Renal Impairment [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) ] • Hypertriglyceridemia [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5 . 12 ) ] • Aluminum Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 13 ) ] The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 3 % ) are hyperglycemia , hypokalemia , pyrexia , and increased blood triglycerides .

6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The clinical data described for PERIKABIVEN ® reflects exposure in 93 patients exposed for 5 to 7 days in 4 active - controlled trials .
The pooled population exposed to PERIKABIVEN ® was 18 to 87 years old , 48 % female , 73 % Caucasian .
The enrolled patients had varied underlying conditions such as gastrointestinal disorders ( 55 % ) , vascular disorders ( 30 % ) , metabolism and nutrition disorders ( 28 % ) , respiratory , thoracic , and mediastinal disorders ( 22 % ) , and psychiatric disorders ( 20 % ) .
Most patients received peripheral intravenous infusion doses of ≥ 80 % of their target mean daily exposure .
Adverse reactions occurring in at least 2 % of patients who received PERIKABIVEN ® are shown in Table 3 .
Table 3 : Adverse Reactions in > 2 % of Patients Treated with PERIKABIVEN ® Adverse reaction PERIKABIVEN ® N = 93 ( % ) Hyperglycemia * 5 ( 5 ) Hypokalemia 4 ( 4 ) Pyrexia 4 ( 4 ) Blood triglycerides increased 3 ( 3 ) Phlebitis 2 ( 2 ) Nausea 2 ( 2 ) Pruritus 2 ( 2 ) Gamma - glutamyltransferase increased 2 ( 2 ) Blood alkaline phosphatase increased 2 ( 2 ) Alanine aminotransferase increased 2 ( 2 ) Blood glucose increased * 2 ( 2 ) C - reactive protein increased 2 ( 2 ) Blood urea increased 2 ( 2 ) Hypoalbuminemia 2 ( 2 ) * Terms as reported in clinical studies Less common adverse reactions in ≤ 1 % of patients who received PERIKABIVEN ® were hyperkalemia , hypomagnesaemia , hypernatremia , tachycardia , hypertension , thrombophlebitis , vomiting , jaundice , rash and increased blood bilirubin .
6 . 2 Post - Marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of PERIKABIVEN ® in countries where it is registered .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily post - approval from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to product exposure .
• Gastrointestinal disorders : abdominal distension , abdominal pain • General disorders and administration site conditions : chest tightness • Hepatobiliary disorders : cholestasis • Immune system disorders : allergic reaction , anaphylaxis • Infections and infestations : infection • Vascular disorders : flushed face 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Coumarin and coumarin derivatives , including warfarin : Anticoagulant activity may be counteracted ; monitor laboratory parameters .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Coumarin and Coumarin Derivatives The soybean oil present in PERIKABIVEN ® has vitamin K1 .
Vitamin K1 can reverse the anticoagulant activity of coumarin and coumarin derivatives , which work by blocking recycling of vitamin K1 .
Monitoring for anticoagulant activity is recommended in patients who are on both PERIKABIVEN ® and coumarin or coumarin derivatives .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal Impairment : Patients on dialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy may require additional protein supplementation to meet nutritional requirements .
If required , adjust the volume of PERIKABIVEN ® administered based on serum electrolyte levels and fluid balance .
( 2 . 4 , 8 . 7 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data on the use of PERIKABIVEN ® in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug - associated risk .
However , there are clinical considerations if PERIKABIVEN ® is used in pregnant women [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with PERIKABIVEN ® .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - Associated Maternal and / or Embryofetal Risk Severe malnutrition in a pregnant woman is associated with preterm delivery , low birth weight , intrauterine growth restriction , congenital malformations and perinatal mortality .
Parenteral nutrition should be considered if a pregnant woman ’ s nutritional requirements cannot be fulfilled by oral or enteral intake .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data available to assess the presence of PERIKABIVEN ® and / or its active metabolite ( s ) in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for PERIKABIVEN ® , and any potential adverse effects of PERIKABIVEN ® on the breastfed child or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of PERIKABIVEN ® in pediatric patients has not been established .
Deaths in preterm infants after infusion of intravenous lipid emulsion have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Patients , particularly preterm infants , are at risk for aluminum toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 13 ) ] .
PERIKABIVEN ® is not recommended for use in pediatric patients under the age of two years , including preterm infants , as the fixed content of the formulation does not meet the nutritional requirements of this age group due to the following reasons : • Calcium and dextrose needs are not met and lipids , protein and magnesium exceed requirements .
• The product does not contain the amino acids cysteine and taurine , considered conditionally essential for neonates and infants .
Patients , including pediatric patients , may be at risk for PNALD [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5 . 15 ) ] .
Newborns – especially those born premature and with low birth weight – are at increased risk of developing hypo – or hyperglycemia and therefore need close monitoring during treatment with intravenous dextrose solutions to ensure adequate glycemic control in order to avoid potential long term adverse effects .
Hypoglycemia in the newborn can cause prolonged seizures , coma and brain damage .
Hyperglycemia has been associated with intraventricular hemorrhage , late onset bacterial and fungal infection , retinopathy of prematurity , necrotizing enterocolitis , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , prolonged length of hospital stay , and death .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of PERIKABIVEN ® did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from other younger patients .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or drug therapy .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment In patients with impaired liver function PERIKABIVEN ® should be administered with caution .

The amino acids provide the structural units that make up proteins and are used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or are oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide as a source of energy .
The administered dextrose is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water , yielding energy .
Intravenously administered lipids provide a biologically utilizable source of calories and essential fatty acids .
Fatty acids serve as an important substrate for energy production .
The most common mechanism of action for energy derived from fatty acid metabolism is beta - oxidation .
Fatty acids are important for membrane structure and function , precursors for bioactive molecules ( such as prostaglandins ) , and as regulators of gene expression .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The infused lipid particles provided by PERIKABIVEN ® are expected to be cleared from the blood stream in a manner thought to be comparable to the clearing of chylomicrons .
In healthy volunteers , the maximum clearance rate of the triglycerides after fasting overnight has been found to be 3 . 8 ± 1 . 5 g / kg per 24 hours .
Both elimination and oxidation rates are dependent on the patient ' s clinical condition ; elimination is faster and utilization is increased in postoperative patients , in sepsis , burns and trauma , while patients with renal impairment and hypertriglyceridemia may show lower utilization of exogenous lipid emulsions .
Due to differences in elimination , patients with these conditions should be closely monitored during PERIKABIVEN ® administration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 , 5 . 11 ) ] .
The disposition of infused amino acids , dextrose and electrolytes are essentially the same as those supplied by ordinary food .
A clinical study in healthy volunteers employing high intravenous doses ( 80 mmol ) of either sodium glycerophosphate used in PERIKABIVEN ® or reference , inorganic sodium phosphate demonstrated that both compounds resulted in comparable serum inorganic phosphate concentrations after a single intravenous dose .
Changes from baseline in the serum levels of sodium , potassium and total calcium were comparable across the two phosphate sources in this study .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate carcinogenic potential of PERIKABIVEN ® or its effect on fertility .
Genotoxicity studies have not been conducted with PERIKABIVEN ® to assess its mutagenic potential .
