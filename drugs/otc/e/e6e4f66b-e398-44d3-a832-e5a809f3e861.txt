Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Blood and Lymphatic System : severe bleeding ( in association with thrombocytopenia ) Hypersensitivity : allergic manifestations , anaphylactoid reactions , angioedema Gastrointestinal : abdominal pain potentially associated with neutropenic enterocolitis , gastrointestinal perforation Pulmonary : interstitial lung disease Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue : severe dermatitis , severe pruritus General and Administration Site Conditions : extravasation , mucosal inflammation 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal data and its mechanism of action , HYCAMTIN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no available clinical data on the use of HYCAMTIN in pregnancy .
Topotecan caused embryolethality , fetotoxicity , and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis at doses similar to the clinical dose ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the background risk of major birth defects is 2 % to 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 % to 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
Data Animal Data In rabbits , an intravenous dose of 0 . 10 mg / kg / day [ about equal to the 1 . 5 mg / m2 clinical dose based on body surface area ( BSA ) ] given on Days 6 through 20 of gestation caused maternal toxicity , embryolethality and reduced fetal body weight .
In the rat , an intravenous dose of 0 . 23 mg / kg / day ( about equal to the 1 . 5 mg / m2 clinical dose based on BSA ) given for 14 days before mating through gestation Day 6 caused fetal resorption , microphthalmia , pre - implant loss , and mild maternal toxicity .
Administration of an intravenous dose of 0 . 10 mg / kg / day ( about half the 1 . 5 mg / m2 clinical dose based on BSA ) given to rats on Days 6 through 17 of gestation caused an increase in post - implantation mortality .
This dose also caused an increase in total fetal malformations .
The most frequent malformations were of the eye ( microphthalmia , anophthalmia , rosette formation of the retina , coloboma of the retina , ectopic orbit ) , brain ( dilated lateral and third ventricles ) , skull , and vertebrae .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of topotecan or its metabolites in human milk or their effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production .
Lactating rats excrete high concentrations of topotecan in milk ( see Data ) .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with HYCAMTIN for injection and for 1 week after the last dose .
Data Following intravenous administration of topotecan to lactating rats at a dose of 4 . 72 mg / m2 ( about twice the 1 . 5 mg / m2 clinical dose based on BSA ) to lactating rats , topotecan was excreted into milk at concentrations up to 48 - fold higher than those in plasma .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating HYCAMTIN for injection [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception HYCAMTIN can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with HYCAMTIN for injection and for 6 months after the last dose .
Males HYCAMTIN may damage spermatozoa , resulting in possible genetic and fetal abnormalities .
Advise males with a female partner of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with HYCAMTIN for injection and for 3 months after the last dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Females HYCAMTIN can have both acute and long - term effects on fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Males Effects on spermatogenesis occurred in animals administered topotecan [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 879 patients with metastatic ovarian cancer or small cell lung cancer in clinical trials of HYCAMTIN for injection , 32 % were aged 65 years and older , while 3 . 8 % were aged 75 years and older .
Of the 140 patients with Stage IV - B , relapsed , or refractory cervical cancer in clinical trials of HYCAMTIN for injection who received HYCAMTIN with cisplatin in the randomized clinical trial , 6 % were aged 65 years and older , while 3 % were aged 75 years and older .
No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dose of HYCAMTIN for injection in patients with a CLcr of 20 to 39 mL / min [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with CLcr greater than or equal to 40 mL / min .
Insufficient data are available in patients with CLcr less than 20 mL / min to provide a dosage recommendation for HYCAMTIN for injection .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdoses ( up to 10 - fold of the recommended dose ) have occurred in patients receiving intravenous topotecan .
The primary complication of overdosage is myelosuppression .
Elevated hepatic enzymes , mucositis , gastrointestinal toxicity , and skin toxicity have occurred with overdosages .
If an overdose is suspected , monitor the patient closely for myelosuppression and institute supportive - care measures as appropriate .
11 DESCRIPTION Topotecan is a topoisomerase inhibitor .
The chemical name for topotecan hydrochloride is ( S ) - 10 - [ ( dimethylamino ) methyl ] - 4 - ethyl - 4 , 9 - dihydroxy - 1 H - pyrano [ 3 ’ , 4 ’ : 6 , 7 ] indolizino [ 1 , 2 - b ] quinoline - 3 , 14 - ( 4 H , 12 H ) - dione monohydrochloride .
The molecular formula is C23H23N3O5 • HCl and the molecular weight is 457 . 9 g / mol .
It is soluble in water and melts with decomposition at 213ºC to 218ºC .
Topotecan hydrochloride has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] HYCAMTIN ( topotecan ) for injection , for intravenous use is supplied as a sterile , lyophilized , buffered , light yellow to greenish powder available in single - dose vials .
Each 4 mg vial contains 4 mg topotecan hydrochloride as free base .
The reconstituted solution ranges in color from yellow to yellow - green .
Inactive ingredients are mannitol , 48 mg , and tartaric acid , 20 mg .
Hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide may be used to adjust the pH . The solution pH ranges from 2 . 5 to 3 . 5 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single - strand breaks .
Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I ‑ DNA complex and prevents re - ligation of these single - strand breaks .
The cytotoxicity of topotecan is thought to be due to double - strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis , when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topotecan , topoisomerase I , and DNA .
Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double - strand breaks .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following administration of HYCAMTIN for injection at doses of 0 . 5 to 1 . 5 mg / m2 ( 0 . 1 to 0 . 3 times the recommended single agent dose ) administered as a 30 - minute infusion , area under the curve ( AUC ) increases proportionally with dose .
Distribution Protein binding of topotecan is approximately 35 % .
Elimination The terminal half - life of topotecan is 2 to 3 hours following intravenous administration .
Metabolism Topotecan undergoes a reversible pH - dependent hydrolysis of its pharmacologically active lactone moiety .
At pH less than or equal to 4 , the lactone is exclusively present , whereas the ring - opened hydroxy - acid form predominates at physiologic pH . Topotecan is metabolized to an N - demethylated metabolite in vitro .
The mean metabolite : parent AUC ratio was about 3 % for total topotecan and topotecan lactone following intravenous administration .
Excretion The overall recovery of total topotecan and its N - desmethyl metabolite in urine and feces over 9 days averaged 73 % ± 2 % following an intravenous dose .
Mean values of 51 % ± 3 % as total topotecan and 3 % ± 1 % as N - desmethyl topotecan were excreted in the urine .
Fecal elimination of total topotecan accounted for 18 % ± 4 % while fecal elimination of N - desmethyl topotecan was 1 . 7 % ± 0 . 6 % .
An O - glucuronidation metabolite of topotecan and N - desmethyl topotecan has been identified in the urine .
Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of topotecan were observed based on age , sex , or hepatic impairment following intravenous administration .
Patients with Renal Impairment Compared to patients with CLcr ( calculated by the Cockcroft - Gault method using ideal body weight ) greater than 60 mL / min , plasma clearance of topotecan lactone decreased by 33 % in patients with CLcr 40 - 60 mL / min and decreased 65 % in patients with CLcr 20 - 39 mL / min .
The effect on topotecan pharmacokinetics in patients with CLcr less than 20 mL / min is unknown [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies No clinically significant changes in topotecan pharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered cisplatin .
No clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of free platinum were observed in patients coadministered cisplatin with topotecan .
In Vitro Studies Topotecan does not inhibit CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2C8 / 9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E , CYP3A , or CYP4A or dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity testing of topotecan has not been performed .
Topotecan is known to be genotoxic to mammalian cells and is a probable carcinogen .
Topotecan was mutagenic to L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells and clastogenic to cultured human lymphocytes with and without metabolic activation .
It was also clastogenic to mouse bone marrow .
Topotecan did not cause mutations in bacterial cells .
Topotecan given to female rats prior to mating at an intravenous dose of 1 . 4 mg / m2 [ about equal to the clinical dose based on body surface area ( BSA ) ] caused superovulation possibly related to inhibition of follicular atresia .
This dose given to pregnant female rats also caused increased pre - implantation loss .
Studies in dogs given at an intravenous dose of 0 . 4 mg / m2 ( about 0 . 25 times the clinical dose based on BSA ) of topotecan daily for a month suggest that treatment may cause an increase in the incidence of multinucleated spermatogonial giant cells in the testes .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Ovarian Cancer The efficacy of HYCAMTIN for injection was evaluated in two clinical trials of 223 patients with metastatic ovarian cancer .
All patients had disease that had recurred on , or was unresponsive to , a platinum - containing regimen .
Patients in these trials received an initial dose of 1 . 5 mg / m2 as an intravenous infusion for 5 consecutive days , starting on Day 1 of a 21 - day cycle .
One trial ( Study 039 ) was a randomized trial of 112 patients who received HYCAMTIN for injection and of 114 patients who received paclitaxel ( 175 mg / m2 intravenously over 3 hours on Day 1 of a 21 - day cycle ) .
All patients had recurrent ovarian cancer after a platinum - containing regimen or had not responded to at least 1 prior platinum - containing regimen .
Patients who did not respond to the trial therapy , or who progressed , could be given the alternative treatment .
The efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate , response duration , time to progression , and overall survival ( OS ) .
The results of the trial did not show statistically significant improvements in response rates , response duration , time to progression , and OS as shown in Table 4 .

In the cross - over phase , 13 % of 61 patients who received HYCAMTIN after paclitaxel had a partial response and 10 % of 49 patients who received paclitaxel after HYCAMTIN had a response ( 2 complete responses ) .
HYCAMTIN for injection was active in ovarian cancer patients who had developed resistance to platinum - containing therapy , defined as tumor progression while on , or tumor relapse within 6 months after completion of , a platinum - containing regimen .
One complete and 6 partial responses were seen in 60 patients , for a response rate of 12 % .
In the same trial , there were no complete responders and 4 partial responders on the paclitaxel arm , for a response rate of 7 % .
HYCAMTIN for injection was also studied in an open - label , non - comparative trial in 111 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer after treatment with a platinum - containing regimen , or who had not responded to 1 prior platinum - containing regimen .
The response rate was 14 % ( 95 % CI : 7 % , 20 % ) .
The median duration of response was 5 months ( 4 . 6 weeks to 9 . 6 months ) .
The time to progression was 2 . 6 months ( 5 days to 1 . 4 years ) .
The median survival was 1 . 3 years ( 1 . 4 weeks , to 2 . 2 years ) .
14 . 2 Small Cell Lung Cancer ( SCLC ) The efficacy of HYCAMTIN for injection was evaluated in 426 patients with recurrent or progressive small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) in a randomized , comparative trial and in 3 single - arm trials .
Randomized Comparative Trial In a randomized , comparative trial , 211 patients were randomized 1 : 1 to receive HYCAMTIN for injection ( 1 . 5 mg / m2 once daily intravenously for 5 days starting on Day 1 of a 21 - day cycle ) or CAV ( cyclophosphamide 1 , 000 mg / m2 , doxorubicin 45 mg / m2 , vincristine 2 mg administered sequentially on Day 1 of a 21 - day cycle ) .
All patients were considered sensitive to first - line chemotherapy ( responders who then subsequently progressed greater than or equal to 60 days after completion of first - line therapy ) .
A total of 77 % of patients treated with HYCAMTIN for injection and 79 % of patients treated with CAV received platinum / etoposide with or without other agents as first - line chemotherapy .
The efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate , response duration , time to progression or OS .
The results of the trial did not show statistically significant improvements in response rate , response duration , time to progression , or OS as shown in Table 5 .

Changes on a disease - related symptom scale are presented in Table 6 .
It should be noted that not all patients had all symptoms , nor did all patients respond to all questions .
Each symptom was rated on a 4 - category scale with an improvement defined as a change in 1 category from baseline sustained over 2 courses .
Limitations in interpretation of the rating scale and responses preclude formal statistical analysis .

In all three trials , patients were stratified as either sensitive ( responders who then subsequently progressed greater than or equal to 90 days after completion of first - line therapy ) or refractory ( no response to first - line chemotherapy or who responded to first - line therapy and then progressed within 90 days of completing first - line therapy ) .
Response rates ranged from 11 % to 31 % for sensitive patients and 2 % to 7 % for refractory patients .
Median time to progression and median survival were similar in all three trials and the comparative trial .
14 . 3 Cervical Cancer The efficacy of HYCAMTIN for injection was evaluated in a multi - center , randomized ( 1 : 1 ) , open - label study ( Study GOG 0179 ) conducted in 147 patients with histologically confirmed Stage IV - B , recurrent , or persistent cervical cancer considered not amenable to curative treatment with surgery and / or radiation .
Patients were randomized to HYCAMTIN for injection ( 0 . 75 mg / m2 once daily intravenously for 3 consecutive days starting on Day 1 of a 21 - day cycle ) with cisplatin ( 50 mg / m2 intravenously on Day 1 ) or cisplatin as a single agent .
Fifty - six percent of patients treated with HYCAMTIN with cisplatin and 56 % of patients treated with cisplatin had received prior cisplatin with or without other agents as first - line chemotherapy .
The efficacy outcome measure was OS .
Median OS of eligible patients receiving HYCAMTIN with cisplatin was 9 . 4 months ( 95 % CI : 7 . 9 , 11 . 9 ) compared with 6 . 5 months ( 95 % CI : 5 . 8 , 8 . 8 ) among patients randomized to cisplatin alone with a log rank P - value of 0 . 033 ( significance level was 0 . 044 after adjusting for the interim analysis ) .
The unadjusted hazard ratio for OS was 0 . 76 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 59 , 0 . 98 ) .
