( 4 , 5 . 3 , 8 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis Rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets may cause myopathy ( muscle pain , tenderness , or weakness with creatine kinase [ CK ] above ten times the upper limit of normal ) and rhabdomyolysis .
Acute kidney injury secondary to myoglobinuria and rare fatalities have occurred as a result of rhabdomyolysis with statins , including rosuvastatin .
Risk Factors for Myopathy Risk factors for myopathy include age 65 years or greater , uncontrolled hypothyroidism , renal impairment , concomitant use with certain other drugs including other lipid - lowering therapies , and higher rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets dosage ; Asian patients on rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets may be at higher risk for myopathy [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 8 ) ] .
The myopathy risk is greater in patients taking rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets 40 mg / 10 mg daily compared with lower rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets dosages .
Steps to Prevent or Reduce the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis The concomitant use of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets with cyclosporine or gemfibrozil is not recommended .
Rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets dosage modifications are recommended for patients taking certain antiviral medications , darolutamide , and regorafenib [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Niacin , fibrates , and colchicine may also increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Discontinue rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets if markedly elevated CK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected .
Muscle symptoms and CK increases may resolve if rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets is discontinued .
Temporarily discontinue rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets in patients experiencing an acute or serious condition at high risk of developing renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis , e . g . , sepsis ; shock ; severe hypovolemia ; major surgery ; trauma ; severe metabolic , endocrine , or electrolyte disorders ; or uncontrolled epilepsy .
Inform patients of the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when starting or increasing the rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets dosage .
Instruct patients to promptly report any unexplained muscle pain , tenderness or weakness , particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever .
5 . 2 Immune - Mediated Necrotizing Myopathy There have been rare reports of immune - mediated necrotizing myopathy ( IMNM ) , an autoimmune myopathy , associated with statin use .
IMNM is characterized by : proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase , which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment ; positive anti - HMG CoA reductase antibody ; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy ; and improvement with immunosuppressive agents .
Additional neuromuscular and serologic testing may be necessary .
Treatment with immunosuppressive agents may be required .
Consider risk of IMNM carefully prior to initiation of a different statin .
If therapy is initiated with a different statin , monitor for signs and symptoms of IMNM .
5 . 3 Hepatic Dysfunction Increases in serum transaminases have occurred with rosuvastatin [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In most cases , the elevations appeared soon after initiation , were transient , were not accompanied by symptoms , and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy .
In a pooled analysis of placebo - controlled trials , increases in serum transaminases to more than three times the ULN occurred in 1 . 1 % of patients taking rosuvastatin versus 0 . 5 % of patients treated with placebo .
Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have also occurred with rosuvastatin .
There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non - fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins , including rosuvastatin .
Patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and / or have a history of liver disease may be at increased risk for hepatic injury .
Consider liver enzyme testing before rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets initiation and thereafter , when clinically indicated .
Rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
If serious hepatic injury with clinical symptoms and / or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs , promptly discontinue rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets .
5 . 4 Proteinuria and Hematuria In the rosuvastatin clinical trial program , dipstick - positive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were observed among rosuvastatin treated patients .
These findings were more frequent in patients taking rosuvastatin 40 mg , when compared to lower doses of rosuvastatin or comparator statins , though it was generally transient and was not associated with worsening renal function .
Although the clinical significance of this finding is unknown , consider a dose reduction for patients on rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets therapy with unexplained persistent proteinuria and / or hematuria during routine urinalysis testing .
5 . 5 Increases in HbA1c and Fasting Serum Glucose Levels Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with statins , including rosuvastatin .
Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin , in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus .
Optimize lifestyle measures , including regular exercise , maintaining a healthy body weight , and making healthy food choices [ See Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .

( 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Drug Interactions that Increase the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe Tablets Rosuvastatin is a substrate of CYP2C9 and transporters ( such as OATP1B1 , BCRP ) .
Rosuvastatin plasma levels can be significantly increased with concomitant administration of inhibitors of CYP2C9 and transporters .
Table 5 includes a list of drugs that increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when used concomitantly with rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets and instructions for preventing or managing them [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Table 5 : Drug Interactions that Increase the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe Tablets Cyclosporine or Gemfibrozil Clinical Impact : Cyclosporine increased rosuvastatin exposure 7 - fold .
In addition , ezetimibe and cyclosporine used concomitantly can increase exposure to both ezetimibe and cyclosporine .
Gemfibrozil significantly increased rosuvastatin exposure and gemfibrozil may cause myopathy when given alone .
The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of cyclosporine or gemfibrozil with rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets .
Intervention : Avoid concomitant use of cyclosporine or gemfibrozil with rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets .
Anti - Viral Medications Clinical Impact : Rosuvastatin plasma levels were significantly increased with concomitant administration of many anti - viral drugs , which increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis .
Intervention : Avoid concomitant use of sofosbuvir / velpatasvir / voxilaprevir and ledipasvir / sofosbuvir with rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets .
In patients taking simeprevir , dasabuvir / ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , elbasvir / grazoprevir , sofosbuvir / velpatasvir , glecaprevir / pibrentasvir , atazanavir / ritonavir , and lopinavir / ritonavir initiate with a dose of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets 5 mg / 10 mg once daily , and do not exceed a dose of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets 10 mg / 10 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
No dose adjustment is needed for concomitant use with fosamprenavir / ritonavir or tipranavir / ritonavir .
Monitor all patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy , particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward titration of either drug .
Darolutamide Clinical Impact : Darolutamide increased rosuvastatin exposure more than 5 - fold .
The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use .
Intervention : In patients taking darolutamide , do not exceed a dose of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets 5 mg / 10 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Regorafenib Clinical Impact : Regorafenib increased rosuvastatin exposure and may increase the risk of myopathy .
Intervention : In patients taking regorafenib , do not exceed a dose of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets 10 mg / 10 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Fenofibrates ( e . g . , fenofibrate and fenofibric acid ) Clinical Impact : Fibrates may cause myopathy when given alone .
The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of fibrates with rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets .
Intervention : Consider if the benefit of using fibrates concomitantly with rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis .
If concomitant use is decided , monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy , particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug .
Niacin Clinical Impact : Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have occurred with concomitant use of niacin with rosuvastatin .
Intervention : Consider if the benefit of using niacin concomitantly with rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis .
If concomitant use is decided , monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy , particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug .
Colchicine Clinical Impact : Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with concomitant use of colchicine with rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets Intervention : Consider if the benefit of using colchicine concomitantly with rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis .
If concomitant use is decided , monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy , particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug .
7 . 2 Drug Interactions that Decrease the Efficacy of Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe Tablets Table 6 presents drug interactions that may decrease the efficacy of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets and instructions for preventing or managing them .
Table 6 : Drug Interactions that Decrease the Efficacy of Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe Tablets Bile Acid Sequestrants Clinical Impact : Concomitant cholestyramine administration decreased the mean exposure of total ezetimibe approximately 55 % .
The incremental LDL - C reduction due to adding ezetimibe may be attenuated by coadminstration with cholestyramine .
[ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention : In patients taking a bile acid sequestrant , administer rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets at least 2 hours before or at least 4 hours after the bile acid sequestrant [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Antacid Clinical Impact : Concomitant aluminum and magnesium hydroxide combination antacid administration decreased the mean exposure of rosuvastatin 50 % and total ezetimibe 4 % .
The incremental LDL - C reduction due to adding rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets may be attenuated by coadministration with antacid .
[ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention : In patients taking antacid , administer rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets 2 hours after the antacid [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
7 . 3 Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe Tablets Effects on Other Drugs Table 7 presents rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets effect on other drugs and instructions for preventing or managing them .
Table 7 : Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe Tablets Effects on Other Drugs Warfarin Clinical Impact : Rosuvastatin significantly increased the INR in patients receiving coumarin anticoagulants [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention : In patients taking warfarin , obtain an INR before starting rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets and frequently enough after initiation , dose titration or discontinuation to ensure that no significant alteration in INR occurs .
Once the INR is stable , monitor INR at regularly recommended intervals .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm .
( 8 . 1 ) • Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended during treatment with rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Discontinue rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets when pregnancy is recognized .
Alternatively , consider the ongoing therapeutic needs of the individual patient .
Rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets decreases synthesis of cholesterol and possibly other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol ; therefore , rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant patients based on the mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
In addition , treatment of hyperlipidemia is not generally necessary during pregnancy .
Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and the discontinuation of lipid - lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on the outcome of long - term therapy of primary hyperlipidemia for most patients .
Available data from case series and prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies over decades of use with statins in pregnant women have not identified a drug - associated risk of major congenital malformations .
Published data from prospective and retrospective observational cohort studies with rosuvastatin use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine if there is a drug - associated risk of miscarriage ( see Data ) .
In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of rosuvastatin to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 40 mg / day resulted in no adverse developmental effects ( see Data ) .
There are insufficient data on ezetimibe use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of ezetimibe to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 10 and 150 times , respectively , the MRHD resulted in no adverse developmental effects ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data A Medicaid cohort linkage study of 1152 statin - exposed pregnant women compared to 886 , 996 controls did not find a significant teratogenic effect from maternal use of statins in the first trimester of pregnancy , after adjusting for potential confounders – including maternal age , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , obesity , and alcohol and tobacco use – using propensity score - based methods .
The relative risk of congenital malformations between the group with statin use and the group with no statin use in the first trimester was 1 . 07 ( 95 % confidence interval 0 . 85 to 1 . 37 ) after controlling for confounders , particularly pre - existing diabetes mellitus .
There were also no statistically significant increases in any of the organ - specific malformations assessed after accounting for confounders .
In the majority of pregnancies , statin treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified .
Study limitations include reliance on physician coding to define the presence of a malformation , lack of control for certain confounders such as body mass index , use of prescription dispensing as verification for the use of a statin , and lack of information on non - live births .
Animal Data Rosuvastatin Rosuvastatin administration did not indicate a teratogenic effect in rats at ≤ 25 mg / kg / day or in rabbits ≤ 3 mg / kg / day ( doses equivalent to the MRHD of 40 mg / day based on AUC and body surface area , respectively ) .
In female rats given 5 , 15 and 50 mg / kg / day before mating and continuing through to gestation day 7 resulted in decreased fetal body weight ( female pups ) and delayed ossification at 50 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the human exposure at the MRHD dose of 40 mg / day based on AUC ) .
In pregnant rats given 2 , 10 and 50 mg / kg / day of rosuvastatin from gestation day 7 through lactation day 21 ( weaning ) , decreased pup survival occurred at 50 mg / kg / day ( dose equivalent to 12 times the MRHD of 40 mg / day based body surface area ) .
In pregnant rabbits given 0 . 3 , 1 , and 3 mg / kg / day of rosuvastatin from gestation day 6 to day 18 , decreased fetal viability and maternal mortality was observed at 3 mg / kg / day ( dose equivalent to the MRHD of 40 mg / day based on body surface area ) .
Rosuvastatin crosses the placenta in rats and rabbits and is found in fetal tissue and amniotic fluid at 3 % and 20 % , respectively , of the maternal plasma concentration following a single 25 mg / kg oral gavage dose on gestation day 16 in rats .
A higher fetal tissue distribution ( 25 % maternal plasma concentration ) was observed in rabbits after a single oral gavage dose of 1 mg / kg on gestation day 18 .
Ezetimibe In oral ( gavage ) embryo - fetal development studies of ezetimibe conducted in rats ( gestation days 6 - 15 ) and rabbits ( gestation days 7 - 19 ) , there was no evidence of maternal toxicity or embryolethality at any dose tested ( 250 , 500 , 1000 mg / kg / day ) at exposures equivalent to 10 and 150 times the clinical exposure , based on AUC , in rats and rabbits .
In rats , increased incidences of common fetal skeletal findings ( extra pair of thoracic ribs , unossified cervical vertebral centra , shortened ribs ) were observed at 1000 mg / kg / day ( ~ 10 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0 - 24 hr for total ezetimibe ) .
In rabbits treated with ezetimibe , an increased incidence of extra thoracic ribs was observed at 1000 mg / kg / day ( 150 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0 - 24 hr for total ezetimibe ) .
The animal - to - human exposure multiple for total ezetimibe at the no observed effect level was 6 times for rat and 134 times for rabbit .
Fetal exposure to ezetimibe ( conjugated and unconjugated ) was confirmed in subsequent placental transfer studies conducted using a maternal dose of 1000 mg / kg / day .
The fetal maternal plasma exposure ratio ( total ezetimibe ) was 1 . 5 for rats on gestation day 20 and 0 . 03 for rabbits on gestation day 22 .
The effect of ezetimibe on prenatal and postnatal development and maternal function was evaluated in pregnant rats at doses of 100 , 300 or 1000 mg / kg / day ( gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 ) .
No maternal toxicity or adverse developmental outcomes were observed up to and including the highest dose tested ( 17 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0 - 24 hr for total ezetimibe ) .
Multiple dose studies of ezetimibe given in combination with statins in rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in higher ezetimibe and statin exposures .
Reproductive findings occurred at lower doses in combination therapy compared to monotherapy .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data from case reports in published literature indicate that rosuvastatin is present in human milk .
There is no available information on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production .
Statins , including rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets , decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol and may cause harm to the breastfed infant .
There is no information about the presence of ezetimibe in human milk .
Ezetimibe is present in rat milk ( see Data ) .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
There is no information about the effects of ezetimibe on the breastfed infant or the effects of ezetimibe on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant , based on the mechanism of action , advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
Data Ezetimibe was present in the milk of lactating rats .
The pup to maternal plasma ratio for total ezetimibe was 0 . 5 on lactation day 12 .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Advanced age ( ≥ 65 years ) is a risk factor for rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets - associated myopathy and rhabdomyolysis .
Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , recognizing the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function ; of concomitant disease or other drug therapy ; and the higher risk of myopathy .

Ezetimibe Of the 2396 patients who received ezetimibe monotherapy in clinical studies , 669 ( 28 % ) were 65 and older , and 111 ( 5 % ) were 75 and older .
Of the 11 , 308 patients who received ezetimibe + statin in clinical studies , 3587 ( 32 % ) were 65 and older , and 924 ( 8 % ) were 75 and older .
No overall differences in safety and effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients .
In a multiple - dose study with ezetimibe , plasma concentrations for ezetimibe were about 2 - fold higher in older ( ≥ 65 years ) healthy subjects compared to younger subjects [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Renal impairment is a risk factor for myopathy and rhabdomyolysis .
Monitor patients with renal impairment for development of myopathy .
In patients with severe renal impairment not on hemodialysis , the recommended starting dosage is 5 mg / 10 mg daily and should not exceed 10 mg / 10 mg daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Rosuvastatin Rosuvastatin exposure is not influenced by mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr ≥ 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) .
Exposure to rosuvastatin is increased to a clinically significant extent in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) who are not receiving hemodialysis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Ezetimibe In a trial of 9270 patients with moderate to severe renal impairment ( 6247 non - dialysis patients with median serum creatinine 2 . 5 mg / dL and median estimated glomerular filtration rate 25 . 6 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 , and 3023 dialysis patients ) , the incidence of serious adverse events , adverse events leading to discontinuation of study treatment , or adverse events of special interest ( musculoskeletal adverse events , liver enzyme abnormalities , incident cancer ) was similar between patients ever assigned to ezetimibe 10 mg plus simvastatin 20 mg ( n = 4650 ) or placebo ( n = 4620 ) during a median follow - up of 4 . 9 years .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets is contraindicated in patients with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 8 Asian Population Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated an approximate 2 - fold increase in median exposure to rosuvastatin in Asian subjects when compared with Caucasian controls .
Adjust the rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets dosage in Asian patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] 10 OVERDOSAGE No specific treatments of over dosage with rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets are known .
Hemodialysis does not significantly enhance clearance of rosuvastatin .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Rosuvastatin Rosuvastatin is an inhibitor of HMG CoA - reductase , the rate - limiting enzyme that converts 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutaryl coenzyme A to mevalonate , a precursor of cholesterol .
In in vivo and in vitro studies , rosuvastatin produces its lipid - modifying effects in two ways .
First , it increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell - surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL .
Second , rosuvastatin inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL , which reduces the total number of VLDL and LDL particles .
Ezetimibe The molecular target of ezetimibe is the sterol transporter , Niemann - Pick C1 - Like 1 ( NPC1L1 ) , which is involved in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols .
Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol , leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver .
This causes a reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The maximum therapeutic response of rosuvastatin is usually achieved by 4 weeks and is maintained after that .
The maximum therapeutic response of ezetimibe is generally achieved within 2 weeks and is maintained during chronic therapy .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Rosuvastatin In clinical pharmacology studies in man , peak plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were reached 3 to 5 hours following oral dosing .
Both Cmax and AUC increased in approximate proportion to rosuvastatin dose .
The absolute bioavailability of rosuvastatin is approximately 20 % .
The AUC of rosuvastatin does not differ following evening or morning drug administration .
Administration of rosuvastatin with food did not affect the AUC of rosuvastatin .
Ezetimibe After oral administration , ezetimibe is absorbed and extensively conjugated to a pharmacologically active phenolic glucuronide ( ezetimibe - glucuronide ) .
After a single 10 - mg dose of ezetimibe to fasted adults , mean ezetimibe peak plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) of 3 . 4 to 5 . 5 ng / mL were attained within 4 to 12 hours ( Tmax ) .
Ezetimibe - glucuronide mean Cmax values of 45 to 71 ng / mL were achieved between 1 and 2 hours ( Tmax ) .
There was no substantial deviation from dose proportionality between 5 and 20 mg .
The absolute bioavailability of ezetimibe cannot be determined , as the compound is virtually insoluble in aqueous media suitable for injection .
Concomitant food administration ( high - fat or non - fat meals ) had no effect on the extent of absorption of ezetimibe when administered as ezetimibe 10 - mg tablets .
The Cmax value of ezetimibe was increased by 38 % with consumption of high - fat meals .
Distribution Rosuvastatin Mean volume of distribution at steady - state of rosuvastatin is approximately 134 liters .
Rosuvastatin is 88 % bound to plasma proteins , mostly albumin .
This binding is reversible and independent of plasma concentrations .
Ezetimibe Ezetimibe and ezetimibe - glucuronide are highly bound ( > 90 % ) to human plasma proteins .
Elimination Rosuvastatin Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolized ; approximately 10 % of a radiolabeled dose is recovered as metabolite .
The major metabolite is N - desmethyl rosuvastatin , which is formed principally by cytochrome P450 \ 2C9 , and in vitro studies have demonstrated that N - desmethyl rosuvastatin has approximately one - sixth to one - half the HMG - CoA reductase inhibitory activity of the parent compound .
Overall , greater than 90 % of active plasma HMG - CoA reductase inhibitory activity is accounted for by the parent compound .
Following oral administration , rosuvastatin and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the feces ( 90 % ) .
The elimination half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of rosuvastatin is approximately 19 hours .
After an intravenous dose , approximately 28 % of total body clearance was via the renal route , and 72 % by the hepatic route .
Ezetimibe Ezetimibe is primarily metabolized in the small intestine and liver via glucuronide conjugation with subsequent biliary and renal excretion .
Minimal oxidative metabolism has been observed in all species evaluated .
In humans , ezetimibe is rapidly metabolized to ezetimibe - glucuronide .
Ezetimibe and ezetimibe - glucuronide are the major drug - derived compounds detected in plasma , constituting approximately 10 to 20 % and 80 to 90 % of the total drug in plasma , respectively .
Both ezetimibe and ezetimibe - glucuronide are eliminated from plasma with a half - life of approximately 22 hours for both ezetimibe and ezetimibe - glucuronide .
Plasma concentration - time profiles exhibit multiple peaks , suggesting enterohepatic recycling .
Following oral administration of 14 C - ezetimibe ( 20 mg ) to human subjects , total ezetimibe ( ezetimibe + ezetimibe - glucuronide ) accounted for approximately 93 % of the total radioactivity in plasma .
After 48 hours , there were no detectable levels of radioactivity in the plasma .
Approximately 78 % and 11 % of the administered radioactivity were recovered in the feces and urine , respectively , over a 10 - day collection period .
Ezetimibe was the major component in feces and accounted for 69 % of the administered dose , while ezetimibe - glucuronide was the major component in urine and accounted for 9 % of the administered dose .
Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Rosuvastatin There were no differences in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin between the nonelderly and elderly populations ( age ≥ 65 years ) .
Ezetimibe In a multiple - dose study with ezetimibe given 10 mg once daily for 10 days , plasma concentrations for total ezetimibe were about 2 - fold higher in older ( ≥ 65 years ) healthy subjects compared to younger subjects .
Gender Rosuvastatin There were no differences in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin between men and women .
Ezetimibe In a multiple - dose study with ezetimibe given 10 mg once daily for 10 days , plasma concentrations for total ezetimibe were slightly higher ( < 20 % ) in women than in men .
Race Rosuvastatin A population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics among Caucasian , Hispanic , and Black or Afro - Caribbean groups .
However , pharmacokinetic studies , including one conducted in the US , have demonstrated an approximate 2 - fold elevation in median exposure ( AUC and Cmax ) in Asian subjects when compared with a Caucasian control group .
[ See Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Specific Populations ( 8 . 8 ) . ]
Ezetimibe Based on a meta - analysis of multiple - dose pharmacokinetic studies , there were no pharmacokinetic differences between Black and Caucasian subjects .
Studies in Asian subjects indicated that the pharmacokinetics of ezetimibe were similar to those seen in Caucasian subjects .
Hepatic Impairment Rosuvastatin In patients with chronic alcohol liver disease , plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were modestly increased .
In patients with Child - Pugh A disease , Cmax and AUC were increased by 60 % and 5 % , respectively , as compared with patients with normal liver function .
In patients with Child - Pugh B disease , Cmax and AUC were increased 100 % and 21 % , respectively , compared with patients with normal liver function [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Ezetimibe After a single 10 - mg dose of ezetimibe , the mean AUC for total ezetimibe was increased approximately 1 . 7 - fold in patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh score 5 to 6 ) , compared to healthy subjects .
The mean AUC values for total ezetimibe and ezetimibe increased approximately 3 - to 4 - fold and 5 - to 6 - fold , respectively , in patients with moderate ( Child - Pugh score 7 to 9 ) or severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh score 10 to 15 ) .
In a 14 - day , multiple - dose study ( 10 mg daily ) in patients with moderate hepatic impairment , the mean AUC for total ezetimibe and ezetimibe increased approximately 4 - fold on both Day 1 and Day 14 when compared to healthy subjects [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , and Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Renal Impairment Rosuvastatin Mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr ≥ 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) had no influence on plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin .
However , plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin increased to a clinically significant extent ( about 3 - fold ) in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) not receiving hemodialysis compared with healthy subjects ( CLcr > 80 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) .
Steady - state plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin in patients on chronic hemodialysis were approximately 50 % greater compared with healthy volunteer subjects with normal renal function .
Ezetimibe After a single 10 - mg dose of ezetimibe in patients with severe renal disease ( n = 8 ; mean CLcr ≤ 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , the mean AUC values for total ezetimibe , ezetimibe - glucuronide , and ezetimibe were increased approximately 1 . 5 - fold , compared to healthy subjects ( n = 9 ) .
Drug Interactions No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction was seen when ezetimibe was coadministered with rosuvastatin .
Specific pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets have not been performed .
Cytochrome P450 Rosuvastatin clearance is not dependent on metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4 to a clinically significant extent .
Rosuvastatin is a substrate for certain transporter proteins including the hepatic uptake transporter organic anion - transporting polyprotein 1B1 ( OATP1B1 ) and efflux transporter breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 , 7 . 3 ) ] .
Ezetimibe had no significant effect on a series of probe drugs ( caffeine , dextromethorphan , tolbutamide , and IV midazolam ) known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 ( 1A2 , 2D6 , 2C8 / 9 and 3A4 ) in a " cocktail " study of twelve healthy adult males .
This indicates that ezetimibe is neither an inhibitor nor an inducer of these cytochrome P450 isozymes .

Higher plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin have been reported in very small groups of patients ( n = 3 to 5 ) who have two reduced function alleles of the gene that encodes OATP1B1 ( SLCO1B1 521 T > C ) .
The frequency of this genotype ( i . e . , SLCO1B1 521 T > C ) is generally lower than 5 % in most racial / ethnic groups .
The impact of this polymorphism on rosuvastatin is unknown .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No animal carcinogenicity or fertility studies have been conducted with the combination of rosuvastatin and ezetimibe .
Rosuvastatin In a 104 - week carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 2 , 20 , 60 , or 80 mg / kg / day by oral gavage , the incidence of uterine stromal polyps was significantly increased in females at 80 mg / kg / day at systemic exposure 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC .
Increased incidence of polyps was not seen at lower doses .
In a 107 - week carcinogenicity study in mice given 10 , 60 , or 200 mg / kg / day by oral gavage , an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenoma / carcinoma was observed at 200 mg / kg / day at systemic exposures 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC .
An increased incidence of hepatocellular tumors was not seen at lower doses .
Rosuvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , the mouse lymphoma assay , and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells .
Rosuvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test .
In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 5 , 15 , 50 mg / kg / day , males were treated for 9 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating and throughout mating until gestation day 7 .
No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 50 mg / kg / day ( systemic exposures up to 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC ) .
In testicles of dogs treated with rosuvastatin at 30 mg / kg / day for one month , spermatidic giant cells were seen .
Spermatidic giant cells were observed in monkeys after 6 - month treatment at 30 mg / kg / day in addition to vacuolation of seminiferous tubular epithelium .
Exposures in the dog were 20 times and in the monkey 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on body surface area .
Similar findings have been seen with other drugs in this class .
Ezetimibe A 104 - week dietary carcinogenicity study with ezetimibe was conducted in rats at doses up to 1500 mg / kg / day ( males ) and 500 mg / kg / day ( females ) ( ~ 20 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0 - 24 hr for total ezetimibe ) .
A 104 - week dietary carcinogenicity study with ezetimibe was also conducted in mice at doses up to 500 mg / kg / day ( > 150 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0 - 24 hr for total ezetimibe ) .
There were no statistically significant increases in tumor incidences in drug - treated rats or mice .
No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in vitro in a microbial mutagenicity ( Ames ) test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli with or without metabolic activation .
No evidence of clastogenicity was observed in vitro in a chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation .
In addition , there was no evidence of genotoxicity in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test .
In oral ( gavage ) fertility studies of ezetimibe conducted in rats , there was no evidence of reproductive toxicity at doses up to 1000 mg / kg / day in male or female rats ( ~ 7 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0 - 24 hr for total ezetimibe ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Primary Hyperlipidemia Rosuvastatin and ezetimibe tablets reduces total - C , LDL - C , Apo B , and non - HDL - C in adults with hyperlipidemia .
Rosuvastatin monotherapy In a multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled , dose - ranging study in patients with hyperlipidemia , rosuvastatin given as a single daily dose for 6 weeks significantly reduced Total - C , LDL - C , non - HDL - C , and Apo B , across the dose range ( Table 12 ) .
Table 12 .

Ezetimibe , added to ongoing statin therapy , significantly lowered total - C , LDL - C , Apo B , non - HDL - C , and TG , and increased HDL - C compared with a statin administered alone ( Table 13 ) .
LDL - C reductions induced by ezetimibe were generally consistent across all statins .

In the overall population , the mean LDL - C reduction from baseline was 22 % .
About one - third of the patients benefited from increasing their dose from 20 mg to 40 mg with further LDL lowering of greater than 6 % .
In the 27 patients with at least a 15 % reduction in LDL - C , the mean LDL - C reduction was 30 % ( median 28 % reduction ) .
Among 13 patients with an LDL - C reduction of < 15 % , 3 had no change or an increase in LDL - C .
Reductions in LDL - C of 15 % or greater were observed in 3 of 5 patients with known receptor negative status .
Ezetimibe monotherapy A study was conducted to assess the efficacy of ezetimibe in the treatment of HoFH .
This double - blind , randomized , 12 - week study enrolled 50 patients with a clinical and / or genotypic diagnosis of HoFH , with or without concomitant LDL apheresis , already receiving atorvastatin or simvastatin ( 40 mg ) .
Patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups : atorvastatin or simvastatin ( 80 mg ) , ezetimibe administered with atorvastatin or simvastatin ( 40 mg ) , or ezetimibe administered with atorvastatin or simvastatin ( 80 mg ) .
Due to decreased bioavailability of ezetimibe in patients concomitantly receiving cholestyramine , ezetimibe was dosed at least 4 hours before or after administration of resins .
Mean baseline LDL - C was 341 mg / dL in those patients randomized to atorvastatin 80 mg or simvastatin 80 mg alone and 316 mg / dL in the group randomized to ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 40 or 80 mg or simvastatin 40 or 80 mg .
Ezetimibe , administered with atorvastatin or simvastatin ( 40 and 80 mg statin groups , pooled ) , significantly reduced LDL - C ( 21 % ) compared with increasing the dose of simvastatin or atorvastatin monotherapy from 40 to 80 mg ( 7 % ) .
In those treated with ezetimibe plus 80 mg atorvastatin or with ezetimibe plus 80 mg simvastatin , LDL - C was reduced by 27 % .
