4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Concomitant administration of SUNLENCA with strong CYP3A inducers is contraindicated due to decreased lenacapavir plasma concentrations , which may result in the loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance to SUNLENCA [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Concomitant administration of SUNLENCA is contraindicated with strong CYP3A inducers .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Immune reconstitution syndrome : May necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
( 5 . 1 ) Residual concentrations of lenacapavir may remain in systemic circulation for up to 12 months or longer .
Counsel patients regarding the dosing schedule ; non - adherence could lead to loss of virologic response and development of resistance .
( 5 . 2 ) May increase exposure and risk of adverse reactions to drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A initiated within 9 months after the last subcutaneous dose of SUNLENCA .
( 5 . 2 ) If discontinued , initiate an alternative , fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen where possible no later than 28 weeks after the final injection of SUNLENCA .
If virologic failure occurs , switch to an alternative regimen if possible .
( 5 . 2 ) Injection site reactions may occur , and nodules and indurations may be persistent .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [ such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia ( PCP ) , or tuberculosis ] , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
Autoimmune disorders ( such as Graves ' disease , polymyositis , Guillain - Barré syndrome , and autoimmune hepatitis ) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution ; however , the time to onset is more variable , and can occur many months after initiation of treatment .
5 . 2 Long - Acting Properties and Potential Associated Risks with SUNLENCA Residual concentrations of lenacapavir may remain in the systemic circulation of patients for prolonged periods ( up to 12 months or longer after the last subcutaneous dose ) .
It is important to counsel patients that maintenance dosing by injection is required every 6 months , because missed doses or non - adherence to injections could lead to loss of virologic response and development of resistance [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Lenacapavir , a moderate CYP3A inhibitor , may increase the exposure to , and therefore potential risk of adverse reactions from , drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A initiated within 9 months after the last subcutaneous dose of SUNLENCA [ see Drug Interactions and Clinical Pharmacology ( 7 . 2 , 12 . 3 ) ] .
If SUNLENCA is discontinued , to minimize the potential risk of developing viral resistance , it is essential to initiate an alternative , fully suppressive antiretroviral regimen where possible no later than 28 weeks after the final injection of SUNLENCA .
If virologic failure occurs during treatment , switch the patient to an alternative regimen if possible [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 3 Injection Site Reactions Administration of SUNLENCA may result in local injection site reactions ( ISRs ) .
If clinically significant ISRs occur , evaluate and institute appropriate therapy and follow - up .
Manifestations of ISRs may include swelling , pain , erythema , nodule , induration , pruritus , extravasation or mass .
Nodules and indurations at the injection site may take longer to resolve than other ISRs .
In clinical studies , after a median follow - up of 553 days , 30 % of nodules and 13 % of indurations ( in 10 % and 1 % of subjects , respectively ) associated with the first injections of SUNLENCA had not fully resolved .
Measurements and qualitative assessments of ISRs were not routinely reported .
Where described , the majority of the injection site nodules and indurations were palpable but not visible , and had a maximum size of approximately 1 to 4 cm [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The mechanism driving the persistence of injection site nodules and indurations in some patients is not fully understood , but based on available data , they may be related to the presence of the subcutaneous drug depot .
In some patients who had a skin biopsy performed of an injection site nodule or induration , dermatopathology revealed foreign body inflammation or granulomatous response .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling : • Immune Reconstitution Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Injection Site Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Most common adverse reactions ( incidence greater than or equal to 3 % , all grades ) are nausea and injection site reactions .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The primary safety assessment of SUNLENCA was based on data from heavily treatment - experienced adult subjects with HIV who received SUNLENCA in a Phase 2 / 3 trial ( CAPELLA ; N = 72 ) through Week 52 ( median duration on study of 71 weeks ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] , as well as supportive data in treatment - naïve adult subjects with HIV who received SUNLENCA in a Phase 2 trial ( CALIBRATE ; N = 157 ) through Week 54 ( median duration of exposure of 66 weeks ) .
The most common adverse reactions ( all Grades ) reported in at least 3 % of subjects in CAPELLA were nausea and injection site reactions .
The proportion of subjects in CAPELLA who discontinued treatment with SUNLENCA due to adverse events , regardless of severity , was 1 % ( Grade 1 injection site nodule in 1 subject ) .
Table 3 displays the frequency of adverse reactions ( all Grades ) greater than or equal to 3 % in the SUNLENCA group .
Table 3 Adverse Reactions ( All Grades ) Reported in ≥ 3 % [ 1 ] of Heavily Treatment Experienced Adults with HIV - 1 Receiving SUNLENCA in CAPELLA ( Week 52 Analysis ) Adverse Reactions SUNLENCA + Background Regimen ( N = 72 ) Injection Site Reactions 65 % Nausea 4 % [ 1 ] Frequencies of adverse reactions are based on all adverse events attributed to trial drug by the investigator , based on all subjects ( cohorts 1 and 2 ) in CAPELLA .
The majority ( 96 % ) of all adverse reactions associated with SUNLENCA were mild or moderate in severity .
Injection - Associated Adverse Reactions Local Injection Site Reactions ( ISRs ) : The most frequent adverse reactions were ISRs .
Of the 72 subjects in CAPELLA , 65 % had experienced an ISR attributed to study drug through at least the Week 52 visit .
Most subjects had mild ( Grade 1 , 44 % ) or moderate ( Grade 2 , 17 % ) ISRs .
Four percent of subjects experienced a severe ( Grade 3 ) ISR ( erythema , pain , swelling ) that resolved within 15 days .
The ISRs reported in more than 1 % of subjects were swelling ( 36 % ) , pain ( 31 % ) , erythema ( 31 % ) , nodule ( 25 % ) , induration ( 15 % ) , pruritus ( 6 % ) , extravasation ( 3 % ) and mass ( 3 % ) .
ISRs reported in 1 % of subjects included discomfort , hematoma , edema , and ulcer .
Nodules and indurations at the injection site took longer to resolve than other ISRs .
The median time to resolution of all ISRs , excluding nodules and indurations , was 5 days ( range : 1 to 183 ) .
The median time to resolution of nodules and indurations associated with the first injections of SUNLENCA was 148 ( range : 41 to 727 ) and 70 ( range : 3 to 252 ) days , respectively .
After a median follow up of 553 days , 30 % of nodules and 13 % of indurations ( in 10 % and 1 % of subjects , respectively ) associated with the first injections of SUNLENCA had not fully resolved .
Qualitative descriptions of injection site nodules and indurations were not routinely reported , but , where reported , the majority of injection site nodules and indurations were palpable but not visible .
Measurements of injection site nodules and indurations were not routinely performed or standardized , but where measurements were reported , the maximum size for the majority of injection site nodules and indurations was approximately 1 to 4 cm [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Laboratory Abnormalities The frequency of laboratory abnormalities ( Grades 3 to 4 ) occurring in at least 2 % of subjects in CAPELLA are presented in Table 4 .
A causal association between SUNLENCA and these laboratory abnormalities has not been established .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Consult the Full Prescribing Information prior to and during treatment for important drug interactions .
( 4 , 7 , 12 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Effect of Other Drugs on SUNLENCA Lenacapavir is a substrate of P - gp , UGT1A1 , and CYP3A .
Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers Drugs that are strong or moderate inducers of CYP3A may significantly decrease plasma concentrations of lenacapavir [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which may result in loss of therapeutic effect of SUNLENCA and development of resistance .
Concomitant administration of SUNLENCA with strong CYP3A inducers during SUNLENCA treatment is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Concomitant administration of SUNLENCA with moderate CYP3A inducers during SUNLENCA treatment is not recommended .
Combined P - gp , UGT1A1 , and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Combined P - gp , UGT1A1 , and strong CYP3A inhibitors may significantly increase plasma concentrations of SUNLENCA .
Concomitant administration of SUNLENCA with these inhibitors is not recommended .
7 . 2 Effect of SUNLENCA on Other Drugs Lenacapavir is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A .
Due to the long half - life of lenacapavir following subcutaneous administration , SUNLENCA may increase the exposure of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] initiated within 9 months after the last subcutaneous dose of SUNLENCA , which may increase the potential risk of adverse reactions .
See the prescribing information of the sensitive CYP3A substrate for dosing recommendations with moderate inhibitors of CYP3A .
7 . 3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Table 5 provides a listing of clinically significant drug interactions with recommended prevention or management strategies , but is not all inclusive .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Individuals infected with HIV should be instructed not to breastfeed due to the potential for HIV transmission .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to SUNLENCA during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry ( APR ) at 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
Risk Summary There are insufficient human data on the use of SUNLENCA during pregnancy to inform a drug - associated risk of birth defects and miscarriage .
In animal reproduction studies , no adverse developmental effects were observed when lenacapavir was administered to rats and rabbits at exposures ( AUC ) ≥ 16 times the exposure in humans at the recommended human dose ( RHD ) of SUNLENCA ( see Data ) .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
The background rate of major birth defects in a U . S . reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program ( MACDP ) is 2 . 7 % .
The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR .
The estimated background rate of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies in the U . S . general population is 15 to 20 % .
Data Animal Data Lenacapavir was administered intravenously to pregnant rabbits ( up to 20 mg / kg / day on gestation days ( GD ) 7 to 19 ) , orally to rats ( up to 300 mg / kg / day on GD 6 to 17 ) , and subcutaneously to rats ( up to 300 mg / kg on GD 6 ) .
No significant toxicological effects on embryo - fetal ( rats and rabbits ) or pre / postnatal ( rats ) development were observed at exposures ( AUC ) approximately 16 times ( rats ) and 39 times ( rabbits ) the exposure in humans at the RHD of SUNLENCA .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV - 1 - infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV - 1 infection .
It is not known whether SUNLENCA is present in human breast milk , affects human milk production , or has effects on the breastfed infant .
After administration to pregnant rats , lenacapavir was detected in the plasma of nursing rat pups , without effects on these nursing pups ( see Data ) .
Because of the potential for 1 ) HIV transmission ( in HIV - negative infants ) ; 2 ) developing viral resistance ( in HIV - positive infants ) ; and 3 ) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant similar to those seen in adults , instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving SUNLENCA .
Data Animal Data Lenacapavir was detected at low levels in the plasma of nursing rat pups in the pre / postnatal development study ( post - natal day 10 ) .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of SUNLENCA have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of SUNLENCA did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment of SUNLENCA is recommended in patients with mild , moderate or severe renal impairment ( estimated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 15 mL per minute ) .
SUNLENCA has not been studied in patients with ESRD ( estimated creatinine clearance less than 15 mL per minute ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment of SUNLENCA is recommended in patients with mild ( Child - Pugh Class A ) or moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B ) hepatic impairment .
SUNLENCA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE No data are available on overdose of SUNLENCA in patients .
If overdose occurs , monitor the patient for evidence of toxicity .
Treatment of overdose with SUNLENCA consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient .
As lenacapavir is highly bound to plasma proteins , it is unlikely to be significantly removed by dialysis .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action SUNLENCA is an HIV - 1 antiretroviral agent [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure - Response In CAPELLA , oral loading doses ( 600 mg on Day 1 and Day 2 , 300 mg on Day 8 ) followed by subcutaneous doses ( 927 mg every 6 months starting on Day 15 ) of SUNLENCA in heavily treatment - experienced subjects with multiclass resistant HIV - 1 , efficacy outcomes ( change in plasma HIV - 1 RNA from Day 1 to Day 14 , and percentage of subjects with HIV - 1 RNA less than 50 copies / mL at Week 26 ) were similar across the range of observed lenacapavir exposures .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At supratherapeutic exposures of lenacapavir ( 9 - fold higher than the therapeutic exposures of SUNLENCA ) , SUNLENCA does not prolong the QTcF interval to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic ( PK ) properties of lenacapavir are provided in Table 6 and Table 7 .
The estimated lenacapavir exposures are comparable between the two recommended dosing regimens .

[ 2 ] Post hoc exposures from CAPELLA ( N = 62 ) .
The estimated exposures of lenacapavir were 43 % to 100 % higher in subjects with HIV - 1 infection compared to subjects without HIV - 1 infection .
Specific Populations There were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of lenacapavir based on age ( 18 to 78 years ) , sex , ethnicity ( hispanic or non - hispanic ) , race ( white , black , asian or other ) , body weight ( 41 . 4 to 164 kg ) , severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance of 15 to less than 30 mL per minute , estimated by Cockroft - Gault method ) , or moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class B ) .
The effect of end - stage renal disease ( including dialysis ) , or severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) , on the pharmacokinetics of lenacapavir is unknown .
As lenacapavir is greater than 98 . 5 % protein bound , dialysis is not expected to alter exposures of lenacapavir [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .

Uridine diphosphate ( UDP ) - glucuronosyl transferase ( UGT ) Enzymes : Lenacapavir is not an inhibitor of UGT1A1 .
Transporter Systems : Lenacapavir is not an inhibitor of organic anion transporter 1 ( OAT1 ) , OAT3 , organic cation transporter ( OCT ) 1 , OCT2 , multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter ( MATE ) 1 , or MATE 2 - K .
Lenacapavir is not a substrate of BCRP , OATP1B1 , or OATP1B3 .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Lenacapavir is a multistage , selective inhibitor of HIV - 1 capsid function that directly binds to the interface between capsid protein ( p24 ) subunits in hexamers .
Surface plasmon resonance sensorgrams showed dose - dependent and saturable binding of lenacapavir to cross - linked wild - type capsid hexamer with an equilibrium binding constant ( KD ) of 1 . 4 nM .
Lenacapavir inhibits HIV - 1 replication by interfering with multiple essential steps of the viral lifecycle , including capsid - mediated nuclear uptake of HIV - 1 proviral DNA ( by blocking nuclear import proteins binding to capsid ) , virus assembly and release ( by interfering with Gag / Gag - Pol functioning , reducing production of capsid protein subunits ) , and capsid core formation ( by disrupting the rate of capsid subunit association , leading to malformed capsids ) .
Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Lenacapavir has antiviral activity that is specific to human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV - 1 and HIV - 2 ) .
The antiviral activity of lenacapavir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV - 1 was assessed in T - lymphoblastoid cell lines , PBMCs , primary monocyte / macrophage cells , and CD4 + T - lymphocytes with EC50 values ranging from 30 to 190 pM .
Lenacapavir displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against all HIV - 1 groups ( M , N , O ) , including subtypes A , A1 , AE , AG , B , BF , C , D , E , F , G with EC50 values ranging from 20 and 160 pM .
The median EC50 value for subtype B isolates ( n = 8 ) was 40 pM .
Lenacapavir was 15 - to 25 - fold less active against HIV - 2 isolates relative to HIV - 1 .
In a study of lenacapavir in combination with representatives from the major classes of anti - retroviral agents ( INSTIs , NNRTIs , NRTIs , and PIs ) , no antagonism of antiviral activity was observed .
Resistance In Cell Culture HIV - 1 variants with reduced susceptibility to lenacapavir have been selected in cell culture .
Resistance selections with lenacapavir identified 7 substitutions in capsid : L56I , M66I , Q67H , K70N , N74D / S , and T107N singly or in dual combination that conferred 4 - to > 3 , 226 - fold reduced phenotypic susceptibility to lenacapavir relative to wild - type ( WT ) virus .
The M66I substitution alone or in combination conferred > 3 , 226 - fold decreased susceptibility to lenacapavir in a single - cycle infectivity assay ; substitutions Q67H and T107N , conferred 4 - to 6 . 3 - fold decreased susceptibility ; K70N , N74D and Q67H / N74S conferred 22 - to 32 - fold decreased susceptibility ; and L56I conferred 239 - fold decreased susceptibility .
In Clinical Trials In CAPELLA , 31 % ( 22 / 72 ) of heavily treatment - experienced subjects met the criteria for resistance analyses through Week 52 ( HIV - 1 RNA ≥ 50 copies / mL at confirmed virologic failure [ suboptimal virologic response at Week 4 , virologic rebound , or viremia at last visit ] ) and were analyzed for lenacapavir resistance - associated substitution emergence .
Lenacapavir resistance - associated capsid substitutions were found in 41 % ( n = 9 ) of subjects with confirmed virologic failure who had post - baseline capsid genotypic resistance data ( n = 22 ) .
The M66I CA substitution was observed in 27 % ( 6 / 22 ) of subjects , alone or in combination with other lenacapavir resistance - associated capsid substitutions including Q67Q / H , Q67Q / H / K / N , K70K / R , K70N / S , N74D , N74N / H , A105T , and T107A .
The other 3 subjects with virologic failure had emergent lenacapavir resistance - associated capsid substitutions Q67K + K70H , Q67H + K70R + T107S , and Q67Q / H .
Phenotypic analyses of the confirmed virologic failure isolates with emergent lenacapavir resistance - associated substitutions showed 6 - to > 1428 - fold decreases in lenacapavir susceptibility when compared to WT .
Among the 9 subjects with virologic failure who developed lenacapavir resistance - associated substitutions in capsid , 4 received SUNLENCA in combination with a background regimen with no fully active antiretrovirals based on the baseline genotypic and / or phenotypic resistance .
Therefore , given the risk of developing resistance in situations of functional monotherapy , careful consideration should be given to having active drugs in addition to SUNLENCA in the treatment regimen .
Four subjects with virologic failure had emergent resistance substitutions to components of the optimized background regimen ( OBR ) : emergent NRTI substitution M184I / V and NNRTI substitution K103N / Y with emtricitabine and doravirine plus atazanavir , bictegravir , and tenofovir alafenamide in OBR ; emergent NNRTI substitution V106M from a mixture at baseline ( in addition to lenacapavir resistance - associated substitutions M66I + T107A ) with doravirine plus emtricitabine and ibalizumab in OBR ; emergent NRTI substitutions K65R and S68N from mixtures at baseline ( in addition to lenacapavir resistance - associated substitution M66I ) with tenofovir alafenamide , plus emtricitabine , dolutegravir , darunavir / cobistat , and rilpivirine in OBR ; and emergent NRTI substitution K65K / R with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus darunavir / cobistat , dolutegravir , and emtricitabine in OBR .
Cross - Resistance The antiviral activity in cell culture of lenacapavir was determined against a broad spectrum of HIV - 1 site - directed mutants and patient - derived HIV - 1 isolates with resistance to the four main classes of anti - retroviral agents ( INSTI , NNRTI , NRTI , and PI ; n = 58 ) , as well as to viruses resistant to the gp120 - directed attachment inhibitor fostemsavir , the CD4 + - directed post - attachment inhibitor ibalizumab , the CCR5 co - receptor antagonist maraviroc , and the gp41 fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide ( n = 42 ) .
These data indicated that lenacapavir remained fully active against all variants tested , thereby demonstrating a non - overlapping resistance profile .
In addition , the antiviral activity of lenacapavir in patient isolates was unaffected by the presence of naturally occurring Gag polymorphisms and substitutions at protease cleavage sites .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Lenacapavir was not carcinogenic in a 6 - month rasH2 transgenic mouse study in males or females at doses of up to 300 mg / kg / dose once every 13 weeks .
A 2 - year rat carcinogenicity study is ongoing .
Mutagenesis Lenacapavir was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity assays , including microbial mutagenesis , chromosome aberration in human peripheral blood lymphocytes , and in in vivo rat micronucleus assays .
Impairment of Fertility There were no effects on fertility , mating performance or early embryonic development when lenacapavir was administered to rats at systemic exposures ( AUC ) 5 times the exposure to humans at the RHD of SUNLENCA .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy and safety of SUNLENCA in HIV - 1 infected , heavily treatment - experienced subjects with multidrug resistance is based on 52 - week data from CAPELLA , a randomized , placebo - controlled , double - blind , multicenter trial ( NCT 04150068 ) .
CAPELLA was conducted in 72 heavily treatment - experienced subjects with multiclass resistant HIV - 1 .
Subjects were required to have a viral load ≥ 400 copies / mL , documented resistance to at least two antiretroviral medications from each of at least 3 of the 4 classes of antiretroviral medications ( NRTI , NNRTI , PI and INSTI ) , and ≤ 2 fully active antiretroviral medications from the 4 classes of antiretroviral medications remaining at baseline due to resistance , intolerability , drug access , contraindication , or other safety concerns .
The trial was composed of two cohorts .
Subjects were enrolled into the randomized cohort ( cohort 1 , N = 36 ) if they had a < 0 . 5 log10 HIV - 1 RNA decline compared to the screening visit .
Subjects were enrolled into the non - randomized cohort ( cohort 2 , N = 36 ) if they had a ≥ 0 . 5 log10 HIV - 1 RNA decline compared to the screening visit or after cohort 1 reached its planned sample size .
In the 14 - day functional monotherapy period , subjects in cohort 1 were randomized in a 2 : 1 ratio in a blinded fashion to receive either SUNLENCA or placebo , while continuing their failing regimen .
This period was to establish the virologic activity of SUNLENCA .
After the functional monotherapy period , subjects who had received SUNLENCA continued on SUNLENCA along with an optimized background regimen ( OBR ) ; subjects who had received placebo during this period initiated SUNLENCA along with an OBR .
Subjects in cohort 1 had a mean age of 52 years ( range : 24 to 71 ) , 72 % were male , 46 % were White , 46 % were Black , and 9 % were Asian .
29 % percent of subjects identified as Hispanic / Latino .
The mean baseline plasma HIV - 1 RNA was 4 . 3 log10 copies / mL ( range : 2 . 3 to 5 . 4 ) .
19 % of subjects had baseline viral loads greater than 100 , 000 copies / mL .
The mean baseline CD4 + cell count was 161 cells / mm3 ( range : 6 to 827 ) .
75 % of subjects had CD4 + cell counts below 200 cells / mm3 .
The mean number of years since subjects first started HIV treatment was 24 years ( range : 7 to 33 ) ; the mean number of antiretroviral agents in failing regimens at baseline was 4 ( range : 1 to 7 ) .
The percentage of subjects in the randomized cohort with known resistance to at least 2 agents from the NRTI , NNRTI , PI and INSTI classes was 97 % , 94 % , 78 % and 75 % , respectively .
In cohort 1 , 53 % of subjects had no fully active agents , 31 % had 1 fully active agent , and 17 % had 2 or more fully active agents within their initial failing regimen , including 6 % of subjects were who were receiving fostemsavir , which was an investigational agent at the start of the CAPELLA trial .
Subjects in cohort 2 initiated SUNLENCA and an OBR on Day 1 .
Subjects in cohort 2 had a mean age of 48 years ( range : 23 to 78 ) , 78 % were male , 36 % were White , 31 % were Black , 33 % were Asian , and 14 % of subjects identified as Hispanic / Latino .
The mean baseline plasma HIV - 1 RNA was 4 . 1 log10 copies / mL ( range : 1 . 3 to 5 . 7 ) .
19 % of subjects had baseline viral loads greater than 100 , 000 copies / mL .
The mean baseline CD4 + cell count was 258 cells / mm3 ( range : 3 to 1296 ) .
53 % of subjects had CD4 + cell counts below 200 cells / mm3 .
The mean number of years since subjects first started HIV treatment was 19 years ( range : 3 to 35 ) ; the mean number of antiretroviral agents in failing regimens at baseline was 4 ( range : 2 to 7 ) .
The percentage of subjects in the non - randomized cohort with known resistance to at least 2 agents from the NRTI , NNRTI , PI and INSTI classes was 100 % , 100 % , 83 % and 64 % , respectively .
In cohort 2 , 31 % of subjects had no fully active agents , 42 % had 1 fully active agent , and 28 % had 2 or more fully active agents within their initial failing regimen , including 6 % of subjects who were receiving fostemsavir , which was an investigational agent at the start of the CAPELLA trial .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects in cohort 1 achieving ≥ 0 . 5 log10 copies / mL reduction from baseline in HIV - 1 RNA at the end of the functional monotherapy period .
The results of the primary endpoint analysis are shown in Table 10 .

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA - approved patient labeling ( Patient Information ) .
Drug Interactions SUNLENCA may interact with certain drugs ; therefore , advise patients to report to their healthcare provider the use of any other prescription or non - prescription medication or herbal products , including St . John ' s wort , during treatment with SUNLENCA [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
If SUNLENCA is discontinued , advise patients that SUNLENCA may remain in the body and affect certain other drugs for up to 9 months after receiving their last injection [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 , 7 . 3 ) ] .
Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider immediately of any symptoms of infection , as in some patients with advanced HIV infection ( AIDS ) , signs and symptoms of inflammation from previous infections may occur soon after anti - HIV treatment is started [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Adherence to SUNLENCA Counsel patients about the importance of continued medication adherence and scheduled visits to maintain viral suppression and to reduce risk of loss of virologic response and development of resistance .
Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider immediately if they stop taking SUNLENCA or any other drug in their antiretroviral regimen [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Injection Site Reactions Inform patients that injection site reactions ( ISRs ) , such as swelling , pain , erythema , nodule , induration , pruritus , extravasation or mass , may occur .
Nodules and indurations at the injection site may take longer to resolve than other ISRs and may be persistent .
Instruct patients when to contact their healthcare provider about these reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Pregnancy Registry Inform patients that there is an antiretroviral pregnancy registry to monitor fetal outcomes of pregnant individuals exposed to SUNLENCA [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Lactation Instruct individuals with HIV - 1 infection not to breastfeed because HIV - 1 can be passed to the baby in breast milk [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 2 ) ] .
