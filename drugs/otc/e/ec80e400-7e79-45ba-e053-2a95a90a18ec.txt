6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trial of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates in practice .
In seven clinical trials , patients with allergic conjunctivitis or those at a risk of developing allergic conjunctivitis received one drop of either cetirizine ( N = 511 ) or vehicle ( N = 329 ) in one or both eyes .
The most commonly reported adverse reactions occurred in approximately 1 – 7 % of patients treated with either ZERVIATE or vehicle .
These reactions were ocular hyperemia , instillation site pain , and visual acuity reduced .
The most common adverse reactions ( 1 – 7 % ) were ocular hyperemia , instillation site pain , and visual acuity reduced .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There were no adequate or well - controlled studies with ZERVIATE ™ ( cetirizine ophthalmic solution ) 0 . 24 % in pregnant women .
Cetirizine should be used in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Animal Data Cetirizine was not teratogenic in mice , rats , or rabbits at oral doses up to 96 , 225 , and 135 mg / kg , respectively ( approximately 1300 , 4930 , and 7400 times the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose ( MRHOD ) , on a mg / m 2 basis ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Cetirizine has been reported to be excreted in human breast milk following oral administration .
Multiple doses of oral dose cetirizine ( 10 mg tablets once daily for 10 days ) resulted in systemic levels ( Mean C max = 311 ng / mL ) that were 100 times higher than the observed human exposure ( Mean C max = 3 . 1 ng / mL ) following twice - daily administration of cetirizine ophthalmic solution 0 . 24 % to both eyes for one week [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Comparable bioavailability has been found between the tablet and syrup dosage forms .
However , it is not known whether the systemic absorption resulting from topical ocular administration of ZERVIATE could produce detectable quantities in human breast milk .
There is no adequate information regarding the effects of cetirizine on breastfed infants , or the effects on milk production to inform risk of ZERVIATE to an infant during lactation .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for ZERVIATE and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ZERVIATE .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ZERVIATE has been established in pediatric patients two years of age and older .
Use of ZERVIATE in these pediatric patients is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies of ZERVIATE in pediatric and adult patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients .
11 DESCRIPTION ZERVIATE is a sterile opthalmic solution containing cetirizene , which is a histamine - 1 ( H1 ) receptor antagonist , for topical administration to the eyes .
Cetirizine hydrochloride is a white , crystalline , water - soluble powder with a molecular weight of 461 . 8 and a molecular formula of C 21 H 25 ClN 20 3 • 2 HCl .
The chemical structure is presented below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Chemical Name : ( RS ) - 2 - [ 2 - [ 4 - [ ( 4 - Chlorophenyl ) phenylmethyl ] piperazin - 1 - yl ] ethoxy ] acetic acid , dihydrochloride Each mL of ZERVIATE contains an active ingredient [ cetirizine 2 . 40 mg ( equivalent to 2 . 85 mg of cetirizine hydrochloride ) ] and the following inactive ingredients : benzalkonium chloride 0 . 010 % ( preservative ) ; glycerin ; sodium phosphate , dibasic ; edetate disodium ; polyethylene glycol 400 ; polysorbate 80 ; hypromellose ; hydrochloric acid / sodium hydroxide ( to adjust pH ) ; and water for injection .
ZERVIATE solution has a pH of approximately 7 . 0 and osmolality of approximately 300 mOsm / kg .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action ZERVIATE , an antihistamine , is a histamine - 1 ( H1 ) receptor antagonist .
The antihistaminic activity of cetirizine has been documented in a variety of animal and human models .
In vivo and ex vivo animal models have shown negligible anticholinergic and antiserotonergic activity .
In vitro receptor binding studies have shown no measurable affinity for other than H1 receptors .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy subjects , bilateral topical ocular dosing of one drop of ZERVIATE ™ ( cetirizine ophthalmic solution ) 0 . 24 % resulted in a mean cetirizine plasma C max of 1 . 7 ng / mL following a single dose and 3 . 1 ng / mL after twice - daily dosing for one week .
The observed mean terminal half - life of cetirizine was 8 . 6 hours following a single dose and 8 . 2 hours after twice - daily dosing of ZERVIATE for one week .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity In a 2 - year carcinogenicity study in rats , orally administered cetirizine was not carcinogenic at dietary doses up to 20 mg / kg ( approximately 550 times the MRHOD , on a mg / m 2 basis ) .
In a 2 - year carcinogenicity study in mice , cetirizine caused an increased incidence of benign liver tumors in males at a dietary dose of 16 mg / kg ( approximately 220 times the MRHOD , on a mg / m 2 basis ) .
No increase in the incidence of liver tumors was observed in mice at a dietary dose of 4 mg / kg ( approximately 55 times the MRHOD , on a mg / m 2 basis ) .
The clinical significance of these findings during long - term use of cetirizine is not known .
Mutagenesis Cetirizine was not mutagenic in the Ames test or in an in vivo micronucleus test in rats .
Cetirizine was not clastogenic in the human lymphocyte assay or the mouse lymphoma assay .
Impairment of Fertility In a fertility and general reproductive performance study in mice , cetirizine did not impair fertility at an oral dose of 64 mg / kg ( approximately 875 times the MRHOD on a mg / m 2 basis ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of ZERVIATE was established in three randomized , double - masked , placebo - controlled , conjunctival allergen challenge ( CAC ) clinical trials in patients with a history of allergic conjunctivitis .
Onset and duration of action were evaluated in two of these trials in which patients were randomized to receive ZERVIATE or vehicle ophthalmic solutions .
Patients were evaluated with an ocular itching severity score ranging from 0 ( no itching ) to 4 ( incapacitating itch ) at several time points after CAC administration .
Table 1 displays data from the mean ocular itching severity scores after ocular administration of an antigen using the CAC model .
A one unit difference compared to vehicle is considered a clinically meaningful change in the ocular itching severity score .
Patients treated with ZERVIATE demonstrated statistically and clinically significantly less ocular itching compared to vehicle at 15 minutes and 8 hours after treatment .
