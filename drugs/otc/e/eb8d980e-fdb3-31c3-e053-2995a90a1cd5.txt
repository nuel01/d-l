3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Capsules : 7 . 9 mg ( voclosporin ) oval , pink / orange in color , imprinted on one side with VCS in white ink .
Capsules : 7 . 9 mg ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS LUPKYNIS is contraindicated in : • Patients concomitantly using strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e . g . , ketoconazole , itraconazole , clarithromycin ) because these medications can significantly increase exposure to LUPKYNIS which may increase the risk of acute and / or chronic nephrotoxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) , and Pharmacokinetics ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
• Patients who have had a known serious or severe hypersensitivity reaction to LUPKYNIS or any of its excipients .
• Patients concomitantly using strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e . g . , ketoconazole , itraconazole , clarithromycin ) .
( 4 ) • Known serious or severe hypersensitivity reaction to LUPKYNIS or any of its excipients .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Nephrotoxicity ( acute and / or chronic ) : May occur due to LUPKYNIS or concomitant nephrotoxic drugs .
Monitor renal function ; consider dosage reduction .
( 5 . 3 ) • Hypertension : May require antihypertensive therapy ; monitor relevant drug interactions .
( 5 . 4 ) • Neurotoxicity : Including risk of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( PRES ) ; monitor for neurologic abnormalities ; reduce dosage or discontinue LUPKYNIS .
( 5 . 5 ) • Hyperkalemia : Risk may be increased with other agents associated with hyperkalemia ; monitor serum potassium levels .
( 5 . 6 ) • QT Prolongation : Consider obtaining electrocardiograms and monitoring electrolytes in patients at high risk .
( 5 . 7 ) • Immunizations : Avoid live vaccines .
( 5 . 8 ) • Pure Red Cell Aplasia : Consider discontinuation .
( 5 . 9 ) 5 . 1 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies Immunosuppressants , including LUPKYNIS , increase the risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies , particularly of the skin .
The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent .
Examine patients for skin changes and advise to avoid or limit sun exposure and to avoid artificial UV light ( tanning beds , sun lamps ) by wearing protective clothing and using a broad spectrum sunscreen with a high protection factor ( SPF 30 or higher ) .
5 . 2 Serious Infections Immunosuppressants , including LUPKYNIS , increase the risk of developing bacterial , viral , fungal , and protozoal infections , including opportunistic infections .
These infections may lead to serious , including fatal , outcomes .
Viral infections reported include cytomegalovirus and herpes zoster infections .
Monitor for the development of infection .
Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient ; use the lowest effective dose needed to maintain response .
5 . 3 Nephrotoxicity LUPKYNIS , like other calcineurin - inhibitors , can cause acute and / or chronic nephrotoxicity .
Nephrotoxicity was reported in clinical trials [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor eGFR regularly during treatment , and consider dose reduction or discontinuation in patients with decreases in eGFR from baseline [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] ; persistent decrease of eGFR should be evaluated for chronic calcineurin - inhibitor nephrotoxicity .
Consider the risks and benefits of LUPKYNIS treatment in light of the patient ’ s treatment response and risk of worsening nephrotoxicity , including in the following situations : • Longer treatment duration beyond one year .
Safety and efficacy of LUPKYNIS have not been established beyond one year [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
• Co - administration with drugs associated with nephrotoxicity .
The risk for acute and / or chronic nephrotoxicity is increased when LUPKYNIS is concomitantly administered with drugs associated with nephrotoxicity .
5 . 4 Hypertension Hypertension is a common adverse reaction of LUPKYNIS therapy and may require antihypertensive therapy [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Some antihypertensive drugs can increase the risk for hyperkalemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
Certain calcium - channel blocking agents ( verapamil and diltiazem ) may increase voclosporin blood concentrations and require dosage reduction of LUPKYNIS [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Monitor blood pressure regularly during treatment and treat new - onset hypertension and exacerbations of pre - existing hypertension .
If a patient experiences increases in blood pressure that cannot be managed with dose reduction of LUPKYNIS or other appropriate medical intervention , consider discontinuation of LUPKYNIS [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 5 Neurotoxicity LUPKYNIS , like other calcineurin - inhibitors , may cause a spectrum of neurotoxicities [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The most severe neurotoxicities include posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( PRES ) , delirium , seizure , and coma ; others include tremors , paresthesias , headache , mental status changes , and changes in motor and sensory functions .
Monitor for neurologic symptoms and consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of LUPKYNIS if neurotoxicity occurs .
5 . 6 Hyperkalemia Hyperkalemia , which may be serious and require treatment , has been reported with calcineurin - inhibitors including LUPKYNIS [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Concomitant use of agents associated with hyperkalemia ( e . g . , potassium - sparing diuretics , ACE inhibitors , angiotensin receptor blockers ) may increase the risk for hyperkalemia .
Monitor serum potassium levels periodically during treatment .
5 . 7 QTc Prolongation LUPKYNIS prolongs the QTc interval in a dose - dependent manner after single dose administration at a dose higher than the recommended lupus nephritis therapeutic dose [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
The use of LUPKYNIS in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong QTc may result in clinically significant QT prolongation .
Certain circumstances may increase the risk of the occurrence of torsade de pointes and / or sudden death in association with the use of drugs that prolong the QTc interval , including ( 1 ) bradycardia ; ( 2 ) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia ; ( 3 ) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval ; and ( 4 ) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval .
5 . 8 Immunizations Avoid the use of live attenuated vaccines during treatment with LUPKYNIS ( e . g . , intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , BCG , yellow fever , varicella , and TY21a typhoid vaccines ) .
Inactivated vaccines noted to be safe for administration may not be sufficiently immunogenic during treatment with LUPKYNIS .
5 . 9 Pure Red Cell Aplasia Cases of pure red cell aplasia ( PRCA ) have been reported in patients treated with another calcineurin - inhibitor immunosuppressant .
All of these patients reported risk factors for PRCA such as parvovirus B19 infection , underlying disease , or concomitant medications associated with PRCA .
A mechanism for calcineurin - inhibitor - induced PRCA has not been elucidated .
If PRCA is diagnosed , consider discontinuation of LUPKYNIS .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors : Reduce LUPKYNIS daily dosage to 15 . 8 mg in the morning and 7 . 9 mg in the evening .
( 2 . 5 , 7 . 1 , 12 . 3 ) • Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers : Avoid co - administration .
( 7 . 1 , 12 . 3 ) • Certain P - gp substrates : Reduce dosage of certain P - gp substrates with a narrow therapeutic window when co - administered with LUPKYNIS .
( 7 . 2 , 12 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Effect of Other Drugs on LUPKYNIS Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors Voclosporin is a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate .
Co - administration with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors increases voclosporin exposure [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which may increase the risk of LUPKYNIS adverse reactions .
Co - administration of LUPKYNIS with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e . g . , ketoconazole , itraconazole , clarithromycin ) is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Reduce LUPKYNIS dosage when co - administered with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e . g . , verapamil , fluconazole , diltiazem ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Avoid food or drink containing grapefruit when taking LUPKYNIS .
Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Voclosporin is a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate .
Co - administration with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers decreases voclosporin exposure [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which may decrease the efficacy of LUPKYNIS .
Avoid co - administration of LUPKYNIS with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers .
7 . 2 Effect of LUPKYNIS on Other Drugs Certain P - gp Substrates Voclosporin is a P - gp inhibitor .
Co - administration of voclosporin increases exposure of P - gp substrates [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which may increase the risk of adverse reactions of these substrates .
For certain P - gp substrates with a narrow therapeutic window , reduce the dosage of the substrate as recommended in its prescribing information , if needed .
OATP1B1 Substrates The effect of LUPKYNIS on OATP1B1 substrates ( e . g . , statins ) has not been studied clinically .
However , voclosporin is an OATP1B1 inhibitor in vitro , and information suggests an increase in the concentration of these substrates is possible [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Monitor for adverse reactions of OATP1B1 substrates when used concomitantly with LUPKYNIS .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : May cause fetal harm .
( 8 . 1 ) • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) • Renal Impairment : Use of LUPKYNIS is not recommended in patients with a baseline eGFR ≤ 45 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 unless the benefit exceeds the risk .
If used in patients with severe renal impairment at baseline , LUPKYNIS should be used at a reduced dose .
( 2 . 4 , 8 . 6 ) • Hepatic Impairment : • Mild and moderate hepatic impairment : Dose reduction is required .
• Severe hepatic impairment : Avoid LUPKYNIS use .
( 2 . 4 , 8 . 7 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Avoid use of LUPKYNIS in pregnant women due to the alcohol content of the drug formulation .
The available data on the use of LUPKYNIS in pregnant patients are insufficient to determine whether there is a drug - associated risk for major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
LUPKYNIS may be used in combination with a background immunosuppressive therapy regimen that includes MMF .
MMF used in pregnant women and men whose female partners are pregnant can cause fetal harm ( major birth defects and miscarriage ) .
Refer to the MMF prescribing information for more information on its use during pregnancy .
In animal reproductive studies , oral administration of either voclosporin or a 50 : 50 mixture of voclosporin and its cis - isomer was embryocidal and fetocidal in rats and rabbits at doses 15 - and 1 - times , respectively , the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 23 . 7 mg twice a day , based on drug exposure AUC .
There were no treatment - related fetal malformations or variations .
Additional findings of reduced placental and fetal body weights occurred in rabbits at 0 . 1 to 0 . 3 - times the MRHD and in rats at higher drug exposures .
Voclosporin was transferred across the placenta in pregnant rats .
For rats , but not all doses in rabbits , these effects were associated with maternal toxicity consisting of reductions in body weight gain .
Dystocia was evident in a pre - and postnatal study in rats , but there were no effects of voclosporin on postnatal growth and development ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - Associated Maternal and / or Embryo / Fetal Risk Pregnant women with SLE are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes , including worsening of the underlying disease , premature birth , miscarriage , and intrauterine growth restriction .
Maternal LN increases the risk of hypertension and preeclampsia / eclampsia .
Passage of maternal autoantibodies across the placenta may result in adverse neonatal outcomes , including neonatal lupus and congenital heart block .
Fetal / Neonatal adverse reactions The formulation of LUPKYNIS contains alcohol ( 21 . 6 mg of dehydrated ethanol per capsule for a total daily dose of 129 . 4 mg / day ) .
Published studies have demonstrated that alcohol is associated with fetal harm including central nervous system abnormalities , behavioral disorders and impaired intellectual development .
There is no safe level of alcohol exposure in pregnancy ; therefore , avoid use of LUPKYNIS in pregnant women .
Data Animal Data Voclosporin ( 90 to 95 % trans - isomer ) is the active ingredient in LUPKYNIS .
Animal reproductive studies were primarily conducted with an approximate 50 : 50 mixture of voclosporin and its cis - isomer .
Similarity of the toxicity effects of the 50 : 50 mixture and voclosporin was demonstrated in comparative toxicity studies with adult rats .
Interconversion between cis and trans isomers was not detected with in vitro or in vivo studies .
In an embryofetal developmental study , pregnant rats were dosed orally , during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 - 17 , with the 50 : 50 mixture of voclosporin and its cis - isomer , litter size was reduced due to increased fetal resorptions and deaths at drug exposures approximately 15 - times the MRHD ( on an AUC basis with a maternal oral dose of 25 mg / kg / day ) .
Surviving fetuses had reduced placental weights and slightly reduced fetal weights .
There were no treatment - related fetal malformations or variations with doses up to 15 - times the MRHD , although reductions in ossification sites were observed in the metatarsal bones .
This dose was associated with maternal toxicity based on decreased body weight gain .
The no effect dose for both fetal and maternal effects occurred at a drug exposure approximately 7 - times the MRHD ( on an AUC basis with a maternal oral dose of 10 mg / kg / day ) .
Two embryofetal developmental studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits that received either the 50 : 50 mixture of voclosporin and its cis - isomer or voclosporin during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 - 18 .
Litter size was reduced due to increased fetal resorptions and deaths with 50 : 50 mixture at drug exposures approximately the MRHD ( on an AUC basis with a maternal oral dose of 20 mg / kg / day ) .
Increased resorptions were observed with voclosporin at 0 . 1 - times the MRHD ( on an AUC basis with a maternal dose of 20 mg / kg / day ) ; however , litter size was not significantly affected .
Decreased placental weights and fetal body weights were observed with the 50 : 50 mixture at doses 0 . 3 - times the MRHD and higher ( on an AUC basis with maternal oral doses of 10 mg / kg / day and higher ) .
Decreased fetal body weights were observed with voclosporin at doses 0 . 1 - times the MRHD and higher ( on an AUC basis with maternal oral doses of 5 mg / kg / day and higher ) .
There were no treatment - related malformations or variations .
Both studies had reductions of ossification sites in the metacarpal bones with the 50 : 50 mixture at doses 2 - times the MRHD , and the sternabrae and hyoid body and / or arches with voclosporin at doses 0 . 1 - times the MRHD and higher .
The high dose of 20 mg / kg / day 50 : 50 mixture or voclosporin was associated with maternal toxicity based on decreased body weight gains .
These rabbit studies indicated that the toxicity of 50 : 50 mixture of voclosporin and its cis - isomer and voclosporin were qualitatively similar ; however , voclosporin was more potent than the 50 : 50 mixture , consistent with its pharmacological potency .
The no effect dose for the fetal effects of voclosporin occurred at a drug exposure approximately 0 . 01 - times the MRHD ( on an AUC basis with a maternal oral dose of 1 mg / kg / day ) .
In a pre - and post - natal developmental study , rats were dosed from gestation day 7 through lactation day 20 with a 50 : 50 mixture of voclosporin and its cis - isomer .
Dystocia ( delayed parturition ) occurred at a dose 12 - times the MRHD ( on an AUC basis with a maternal oral dose of 25 mg / kg / day ) that resulted in reductions of the mean number of total pups delivered and surviving pups per litter .
This dose was associated with maternal toxicity based on decreased body weight gain .
No adverse effects on dams or their pups were observed at doses 3 - times the MRHD and lower ( on an AUC basis with a maternal oral dose of 10 mg / kg / day ) .
There were no effects on behavioral and physical development , or the reproductive performance of male or female pups .
The no effect dose for delivery and pup survival was 10 mg / kg / day .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no available data on the presence of voclosporin in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Voclosporin is present in milk of lactating rats .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
Given the serious adverse reactions seen in adult patients treated with LUPKYNIS such as increased risk of serious infections , advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment and for at least 7 days after the last dose of LUPKYNIS ( approximately 6 elimination half - lives ) .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential LUPKYNIS may be used in combination with a background immunosuppressive therapy regimen that includes MMF .
If LUPKYNIS is administered with MMF , the information for MMF regarding pregnancy testing , contraception , and infertility also applies to this combination regimen .
Refer to MMF prescribing information for additional information .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of LUPKYNIS in pediatric patients has not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of LUPKYNIS did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Use of LUPKYNIS is not recommended in patients with a baseline eGFR ≤ 45 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 unless the benefit exceeds the risk .
If used in patients with severe renal impairment at baseline , LUPKYNIS should be used at a reduced dose [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment at baseline [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Monitor eGFR closely .
After initiating therapy , dosing adjustments should be made based on eGFR [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment In patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh A and Child - Pugh B ) , reduce the LUPKYNIS dosage [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Avoid LUPKYNIS in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Cases of accidental overdose have been reported with LUPKYNIS ; symptoms may include tremor , headache , nausea and vomiting , infections , tachycardia , urticaria , lethargy , and increases in blood urea nitrogen , serum creatinine , and alanine aminotransferase levels .
No specific antidote to LUPKYNIS therapy is available .
If overdose occurs , general supportive measures and symptomatic treatment should be conducted , including stopping treatment with LUPKYNIS and assessing blood urea nitrogen , serum creatinine , eGFR and alanine aminotransferase levels .
Consider contacting a poison center ( 1 - 800 - 222 - 1222 ) or medical toxicologist for advice and review of overdosage management recommendations .
11 DESCRIPTION LUPKYNIS ( voclosporin ) capsules , a calcineurin - inhibitor immunosuppressant , is available for administration as soft gelatin capsules containing 7 . 9 mg voclosporin per capsule .
Inactive ingredients include alcohol , Vitamin E polyethylene glycol succinate ( NF ) , polysorbate 40 ( NF ) , medium - chain triglycerides ( NF ) , gelatin , sorbitol , glycerin , iron oxide yellow , iron oxide red , titanium dioxide , and water .
Voclosporin ( 90 to 95 % trans - isomer ) is the active ingredient in LUPKYNIS .
Chemically , voclosporin is named : Cyclo { { ( 6 E ) - ( 2 S , 3 R , 4 R ) - 3 - hydroxy - 4 - methyl - 2 - ( methylamino ) - 6 , 8 - nonadienoyl } - L - 2 - aminobutyryl - N - methyl - glycyl - N - methyl - L - leucyl - L - valyl - N - methyl - L - leucyl - L - alanyl - D - alanyl - N - methyl - L - leucyl - N - methyl - L - leucyl - N - methyl - L - valyl } .
The chemical structure of voclosporin is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Voclosporin has an empirical formula of C 63 H 111 N 11 O 12 and a molecular weight of 1214 . 6 g / mole .
It appears as white to off - white solid matter .
At ambient temperature , voclosporin is freely soluble in acetone , acetonitrile , ethanol , and methanol , and practically insoluble in heptanes ( USP ) .
Voclosporin is practically insoluble ( less than 0 . 1 g / L at 20ºC ) in water and melts above 144ºC with decomposition .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action LUPKYNIS is a calcineurin - inhibitor immunosuppressant .
The mechanism of voclosporin suppression of calcineurin has not been fully established .
Activation of lymphocytes involves an increase in intracellular calcium concentrations that bind to the calcineurin regulatory site and activate calmodulin binding catalytic subunit and through dephosphorylation activates the transcription factor , Nuclear Factor of Activated T - Cell Cytoplasmic ( NFATc ) .
The immunosuppressant activity results in inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation , T - cell cytokine production , and expression of T - cell activation surface antigens .
Studies in animal models also support a non - immunological role for calcineurin inhibition in kidney function to stabilize actin cytoskeleton and stress fibers in podocytes leading to increased podocyte integrity in glomeruli .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Calcineurin inhibition Concentration - dependent calcineurin inhibition , measured as the percent of maximum calcineurin inhibition , was observed after oral administration of voclosporin twice daily in healthy volunteers .
There is little or no lag time between the time to maximum drug concentration and the time to maximum calcineurin inhibition .
Voclosporin inhibits calcineurin in a dose - dependent manner up to a maximum dose of 1 . 0 mg / kg .
Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized , placebo - and active - controlled ( moxifloxacin 400 mg ) , single dose study with parallel study design , dose - dependent QT prolonging effect was detected with LUPKYNIS in the dose range of 0 . 5 – 4 . 5 mg / kg ( up to 9 - fold coverage of the therapeutic exposure ) .
Dose - dependent QT prolongation effect was observed with a time to maximum QTc increase occurring at 4 – 6 - hour postdose across different dose levels .
The maximum mean placebo - adjusted changes of QTcF from baseline after LUPKYNIS 0 . 5 mg / kg , 1 . 5 mg / kg , 3 . 0 mg / kg , and 4 . 5 mg / kg dose were 6 . 4 msec , 17 . 5 msec , 25 . 7 msec , and 34 . 6 msec , respectively .
In a separate , randomized , placebo - controlled , crossover study in 31 healthy subjects , an absence of large mean increases ( i . e . , > 20 msec ) was observed following 7 days of treatment with LUPKYNIS at 0 . 3 , 0 . 5 and 1 . 5 mg / kg twice daily ( approximately 6 - fold coverage of the therapeutic exposure ) .
The mechanism for the QT prolonging effect as observed in the single - dose and multiple - dose studies is unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The whole blood voclosporin pharmacokinetics increase in a greater than dose - proportional manner over the therapeutic range .
With a twice daily dosing regimen , voclosporin achieves steady - state after 6 days and the accumulation is approximately 2 - fold .
Absorption The median T max of voclosporin is 1 . 5 hours ( 1 to 4 hours ) when administered on an empty stomach .
Effect of Food Co - administration of voclosporin with food decreased both the rate and extent of absorption : with either low - or high - fat meals , C max and AUC of voclosporin were reduced by 29 % to 53 % and 15 % to 25 % , respectively .
Distribution The apparent volume of distribution ( V ss / F ) of voclosporin is 2 , 154 L . Protein binding of voclosporin is 97 % .
Voclosporin partitions extensively into red blood cells and distribution between whole blood and plasma is concentration - and temperature - dependent .
Elimination The mean apparent clearance at steady - state ( CL ss / F ) of voclosporin is 63 . 6 L / h , and mean terminal half - life ( t 1 / 2 ) is approximately 30 hours ( 24 . 9 to 36 . 5 hours ) .
Metabolism Voclosporin is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 .
Voclosporin is the major circulating component and the pharmacologic activity is mainly attributed to the parent molecule .
A major metabolite in human whole blood represented 16 . 7 % of total exposure and is about 8 - fold less potent than the parent molecule .
Excretion Following single oral administration of radiolabeled voclosporin 70 mg , 92 . 7 % of the radioactivity was recovered in feces ( including 5 % as unchanged voclosporin ) , and 2 . 1 % was recovered in urine ( including 0 . 25 % as unchanged voclosporin ) .
Specific Populations There were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of voclosporin based on age ( 18 to 66 years ) , sex , race ( Caucasian , Black , Asian , other ) , or body weight ( 37 to 133 kg ) .
Patients with Renal Impairment Voclosporin C max and AUC were similar in volunteers with mild ( CL Cr 60 to 89 mL / min as estimated by Cockcroft - Gault ) and moderate ( CL Cr 30 to 59 mL / min ) renal impairment compared to volunteers with normal renal function ( CL Cr ≥ 90 mL / min ) .
The C max and AUC increased 1 . 5 - and 1 . 7 - fold , respectively , in volunteers with severe renal impairment ( CL Cr < 30 mL / min ) .
The effect of end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) with or without hemodialysis on the pharmacokinetics of voclosporin is unknown .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Voclosporin C max and AUC increased approximately 1 . 5 - to 2 . 0 - fold in volunteers with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh A ) or moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh B ) .
The effect of severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) on the pharmacokinetics of voclosporin is unknown .
Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Other Drugs on LUPKYNIS The effect of co ‑ administered drugs on the exposure of voclosporin is shown in Table 2 .

• Weak CYP3A inhibitors : Co - administration of multiple doses of fluvoxamine and cimetidine is predicted to have minimal effects on voclosporin C max and AUC 0 - 12 .
• Moderate CYP3A inducers : Co - administration of multiple doses of efavirenz is predicted to decrease voclosporin C max and AUC 0 - 12 by 61 % and 70 % , respectively .
In vitro , voclosporin is not a substrate for breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) or organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 .
Effect of LUPKYNIS on other Drugs Voclosporin was studied on a background therapy that included MMF .
Voclosporin 23 . 7 mg twice a day in patients with SLE ( with or without LN ) had no effect on MPA exposure .
Also , clinical studies indicate that voclosporin is a weak inhibitor of P - gp and has no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate midazolam .
Summary of the results from clinical studies which evaluated the effect of voclosporin on other drugs is provided in Table 3 .

Voclosporin is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a 2 - year mouse carcinogenicity study , administration of voclosporin at oral doses of 3 , 10 , or 30 mg / kg / day resulted in an increased incidence of malignant lymphoma in high dose females ( 7 . 5 times the MRHD on an AUC basis ) and a dose - responsive trend for increase in malignant lymphoma in males .
Malignant lymphoma was considered drug related in mice .
In a 2 - year rat carcinogenicity study , oral administration of voclosporin at doses up to 1 . 25 mg / kg / day in males and 2 . 5 mg / kg / day in females ( doses that result in approximately similar drug exposures in rats ) resulted in no statistically significant increases of tumor incidences .
In a 39 - week oral toxicology study with monkeys , malignant lymphomas occurred at a dose of 150 mg / kg / day ( approximately 4 - and 7 - times MRHD based on AUC for male and female animals , respectively ) .
[ At this dose , monkeys experienced high levels of immunosuppression as indicated by maximum calcineurin inhibition levels ( E max ) of greater than 80 % . ]
Voclosporin was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a standard battery of genetic toxicity studies that included the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay , in vitro Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosomal aberration assay , and in vivo rat micronucleus assay .
Voclosporin had no effect on fertility at doses up to 25 mg / kg / day in male and female rats ( 16 - and 9 - times MRHD based on AUC , respectively ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of LUPKYNIS were investigated in Study 1 ( NCT03021499 ) , a 52 - week , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial in patients with a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus and with International Society of Nephrology / Renal Pathology Society ( ISN / RPS ) biopsy - proven active Class III or IV LN ( alone or in combination with Class V LN ) or Class V LN .
Patients with Class III or IV LN ( alone or in combination with Class V LN ) were required to have a urine protein to creatinine ( UPCR ) ratio of ≥ 1 . 5 mg / mg ; patients with Class V LN were required to have a UPCR of ≥ 2 mg / mg .
A total of 357 patients with LN were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive either LUPKYNIS 23 . 7 mg twice daily or placebo .
Patients in both arms received background treatment with MMF and corticosteroids as follows : • Oral MMF at a target dose of 2 g / day ( 1 g twice a day ) .
( Patients not already receiving MMF were started on MMF 500 mg twice a day with escalation to MMF 1 g twice a day after the first week . )
Dose increases up to 3 g / day were allowed .
• Intravenous ( IV ) methylprednisolone on Day 1 and Day 2 at a dose of 500 mg / day ( body weight ≥ 45 kg ) or 250 mg / day ( body weight < 45 kg ) followed by a reducing taper of oral corticosteroids [ oral prednisone 25 mg / day ( body weight ≥ 45 kg ) or 20 mg / day ( body weight < 45 kg ) ; tapered to achieve a target dose of 2 . 5 mg / day by Week 16 ] .
Throughout the study , patients were prohibited from using immunosuppressants ( other than MMF and hydroxychloroquine / chloroquine ) and from changing / commencing angiotensin II receptor blockers ( ARBs ) or angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors .
Patients with baseline eGFR ≤ 45 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 were not enrolled in this study .
Dosage was adjusted based on eGFR and BP in a pre - defined dosage adjustment protocol .
Dosage adjustments should follow the dosage recommendations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
The median age of patients was 31 years ( range 18 to 72 ) .
The proportion of women was 88 % .

The mean ( SD ) starting oral corticosteroid dose ( Day 3 ) was 22 . 8 ( ± 4 . 8 ) mg / day ; approximately 81 % received ≤ 2 . 5 mg / day of oral corticosteroids at Week 16 .
The distribution by kidney biopsy class was Class III or IV ( 60 . 8 % ) , Class III or IV in combination with Class V ( 24 . 9 % ) , and Class V ( 14 . 3 % ) .
Mean ( SD ) eGFR on entry was 91 ( ± 30 ) mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 .
Mean ( SD ) UPCR on entry was 4 . 0 ( ± 2 . 5 ) mg / mg .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving complete renal response at Week 52 .
Complete renal response was defined as follows ( both must be met ) : • UPCR of ≤ 0 . 5 mg / mg , and • eGFR ≥ 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 or no confirmed decrease from baseline in eGFR of > 20 % or no treatment - or disease - related eGFR - associated event ( defined as blood creatinine increased , creatinine renal clearance decreased , glomerular filtration rate decreased , serum creatinine increased , renal impairment , renal failure , or renal failure acute ) at time of assessment .
In order to be considered a responder , the patient must not have received more than 10 mg prednisone for ≥ 3 consecutive days or for ≥ 7 days in total during Weeks 44 through 52 .
Patients who received rescue medication or withdrew from the study were considered non - responders .
A higher proportion of patients in the LUPKYNIS arm than the placebo arm achieved complete renal response at Week 52 ( Table 4 ) .
