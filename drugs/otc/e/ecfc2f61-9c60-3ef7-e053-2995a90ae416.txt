DESCRIPTION The DELFLEX ® peritoneal dialysis solutions ( standard and low magnesium / low calcium ) are sterile , non - pyrogenic formulations of dextrose and electrolytes in water for injection , USP , for use in peritoneal dialysis .
These solutions do not contain antimicrobial agents or additional buffers .
Composition , calculated osmolarity , pH , and ionic concentrations are shown in Table 2 .
Dextrose , USP , is chemically designated D - glucose monohydrate ( C 6 H 12 O 6 • H 2 O ) a hexose sugar freely soluble in water .
The structural formula is shown here : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Calcium chloride , USP , is chemically designated calcium chloride dihydrate ( CaCl 2 • 2 H 2 O ) white fragments or granules freely soluble in water .
Magnesium chloride , USP , is chemically designated magnesium chloride hexahydrate ( MgCl 2 • 6 H 2 O ) colorless flakes or crystals very soluble in water .
Sodium lactate solution , USP , is chemically designated ( CH 3 CH ( OH ) COONa ) , a 60 % aqueous solution miscible in water .
Sodium chloride , USP , is chemically designated ( NaCl ) , a white , crystalline compound freely soluble in water .
Water for injection , USP , is chemically designated ( H 2 O ) .
Hydrochloric Acid or Sodium Hydroxide may be added for pH adjustment .
pH is 5 . 5 ± 0 . 5 .
Exposure to temperatures above 25 ° C ( 77 ° F ) during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content .
Higher temperatures lead to greater losses .
It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period .
Since the inner bag is compounded from flexible plastic , water may permeate from the inner bag into the overwrap in quantities insufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions in contact with the plastic inner bag can cause certain chemical components of the bag to leach out in very small amounts ; however , the safety of the plastic formulation is supported by biological tests for plastic containers .

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action DELFLEX peritoneal dialysis solutions are hypertonic peritoneal dialysis solutions containing dextrose , a monosaccharide , as the primary osmotic agent .
An osmotic gradient must be created between the peritoneal membrane and the dialysis solution in order for ultrafiltration to occur .
The hypertonic concentration of glucose in DELFLEX solutions exert an osmotic pressure across the peritoneal membrane resulting in transcapillary ultrafiltration .
Like other peritoneal dialysis solutions , DELFLEX solutions contain electrolytes to facilitate the correction of acid - base and electrolyte abnormalities .
DELFLEX solutions contain a buffer , lactate , to help normalize acid - base abnormalities .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Glucose can be rapidly absorbed from the peritoneal cavity by diffusion and appears quickly in the circulation due to the high glucose concentration gradient between DELFLEX solutions compared to blood capillary glucose level .
Absorption per unit time will be the highest at the start of an exchange and decreases over time .
The rate of glucose absorption will be dependent upon the transport characteristics of the patient ' s peritoneal membrane as determined by a peritoneal equilibration test ( PET ) .
Glucose absorption will also depend upon the concentration of glucose used for the exchange and the length of the dwell .
Transport of other molecules will be dependent upon the molecular size of the solute , the concentration gradient , and the effective peritoneal surface area as determined by the PET .
Metabolism and Elimination Glucose is metabolized by normal cellular pathways ( i . e . , glycolysis ) .
Metabolism of lactate occurs in the liver and results in the generation of the bicarbonate .
Glucose not absorbed during PD exchange procedure is removed by drainage of the PD solution from the peritoneal cavity .
Drug Interaction Studies Antibiotics No formal clinical drug interaction studies have been performed .
In vitro studies of the following medications have demonstrated stability with DELFLEX solutions : cefazolin , ceftazidime , gentamicin , and vancomycin .
13 .
NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long term animal studies with DELFLEX peritoneal dialysis solutions have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential , mutagenic potential or effect on fertility .

PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Aseptic technique must be used throughout the procedure and at its termination in order to reduce the possibility of infection .
The solution bag should remain in the carton and the overwrap intact until time of use .
Use only after checking for strength , clarity , amount , leaks , and expiration date .
Advise patients that DELFLEX peritoneal dialysis solution should not be heated in a microwave oven .
Care should be taken to ensure that there is not any leakage around the catheter , since if not controlled , the leakage can create edema from subcutaneous infiltration of the dialysis solution .
The leakage will also create an inaccurate fluid balance measurement .
If any leakage is identified , advise the patient not to proceed with infusion and notify your physician .
