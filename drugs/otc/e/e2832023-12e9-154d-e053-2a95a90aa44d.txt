WARNING : COMPLEX SLEEP BEHAVIORS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning Complex sleep behaviors including sleep - walking , sleep - driving , and engaging in other activities while not fully awake may occur following use of ZOLPIMIST .
Some of these events may result in serious injuries , including death .
Discontinue ZOLPIMIST immediately if a patient experiences a complex sleep behavior .
( 4 , 5 . 1 ) 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE ZOLPIMIST ( zolpidem tartrate ) is indicated for the short - term treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep initiation .
Zolpidem tartrate has been shown to decrease sleep latency for up to 35 days in controlled clinical studies [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The clinical trials performed in support of efficacy were 4 - 5 weeks in duration with the final formal assessments of sleep latency performed at the end of treatment .
ZOLPIMIST is indicated for the short - term treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep initiation .
Zolpidem tartrate has been shown to decrease sleep latency for up to 35 days in controlled clinical studies .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Adult dose : 10 mg once daily immediately before bedtime .
( 2 . 1 ) • Elderly / debilitated patients / hepatic impaired : 5 mg once daily immediately before bedtime .
( 2 . 2 ) • Downward dosage adjustment may be necessary when used with CNS depressants .
( 2 . 3 ) • Should not be taken with or immediately after a meal .
( 2 . 4 ) 2 . 1 Dosage in Adults Use the lowest effective dose for the patient .
The recommended initial dose is 5 mg for women and either 5 or 10 mg for men , taken only once per night immediately before bedtime with at least 7 - 8 hours remaining before the planned time of awakening .
If the 5 mg dose is not effective , the dose can be increased to 10 mg .
In some patients , the higher morning blood levels following use of the 10 mg dose increase the risk of next day impairment of driving and other activities that require full alertness [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The total dose of ZOLPIMIST should not exceed 10 mg once daily immediately before bedtime .
The recommended initial doses for women and men are different because zolpidem clearance is lower in women .
2 . 2 Special Populations Elderly or debilitated patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of zolpidem tartrate .
Patients with hepatic insufficiency do not clear the drug as rapidly as normal subjects .
The recommended dose of ZOLPIMIST in both of these patient populations is 5 mg once daily immediately before bedtime [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ; Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
2 . 3 Use with CNS Depressants Dosage adjustment may be necessary when ZOLPIMIST is combined with other CNS - depressant drugs because of the potentially additive effects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
2 . 4 Administration ZOLPIMIST is packaged in a child - resistant container .
For detailed instructions on how to use ZOLPIMIST , refer to the Patient Instructions for Use ( following the Medication Guide ) .
ZOLPIMIST must be primed before it is used for the first time .
To prime , patients should be told to point the black spray opening away from their face and other people and spray 5 times .
For administration , the child - resistant container should be held upright with the black spray opening pointed directly into the mouth .
The patient should fully press down on the pump to make sure a full dose ( 5 mg ) of ZOLPIMIST is sprayed directly into the mouth over the tongue .
If a 10 mg dose is prescribed , a second spray should be administered .
If the patient does not use ZOLPIMIST for at least 14 days , it must be primed again with 1 spray .
The patient should be referred to the Patient Instructions for Use included at the end of the Medication Guide .
The effect of ZOLPIMIST may be slowed by ingestion with or immediately after a meal .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS ZOLPIMIST is available as a clear , colorless , and cherry flavored solution designed to be sprayed directly into the mouth over the tongue .
Each metered actuation ( one spray ) of ZOLPIMIST delivers 5 mg of zolpidem tartrate in 100 μL .
Two actuations deliver 10 mg of zolpidem tartrate .
After an initial priming of 5 actuations , there are 60 metered actuations in each child - resistant container .
The total number of available doses is dependent on the number of actuations per dose ( 1 or 2 actuations ) and the frequency of priming .

( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS ZOLPIMIST is contraindicated in patients : ZOLPIMIST is contraindicated in patients : • who have experienced complex sleep behaviors after taking ZOLPIMIST [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • with known hypersensitivity to zolpidem tartrate [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
• Patients who have experienced complex sleep behaviors after taking ZOLPIMIST .
( 4 ) • Known hypersensitivity to zolpidem tartrate .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • CNS - depressant Effects : Impairs alertness and motor coordination , including the risk of morning impairment .
If used in combination with other CNS depressants , dose reduction may be needed due to additive effects .
Do not use with alcohol .
Instruct patients on correct use .
( 2 . 3 , 5 . 2 ) • Need to Evaluate for Co - Morbid Diagnosis : Reevaluate if insomnia persists after 7 to 10 days of use .
( 5 . 3 ) • Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid Reactions : Angioedema and anaphylaxis have been reported .
Do not rechallenge if such reactions occur .
( 5 . 4 ) • Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral changes : Changes including decreased inhibition , bizarre behavior , agitation , and depersonalization have been reported .
Immediately evaluate any new onset of behavioral changes .
( 5 . 5 ) • Depression : Worsening of depression or suicidal thinking may occur .
Prescribe the least amount feasible to avoid intentional overdose .
( 5 . 7 ) • Withdrawal Effects : Symptoms may occur with rapid dose reduction or discontinuation .
( 5 . 5 , 9 . 3 ) • Elderly / debilitated patients : Use lower dose due to impaired motor , cognitive performance , and increased sensitivity .
( 2 . 2 , 5 . 7 ) • Patients with hepatic impairment , mild to moderate COPD , impaired drug metabolism or hemodynamic responses , mild to moderate sleep apnea : Use with caution and monitor closely .
( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Complex Sleep Behaviors Complex sleep behaviors including sleep - walking , sleep - driving , and engaging in other activities while not fully awake may occur following the first or any subsequent use of zolpidem .
Patients can be seriously injured or injure others during complex sleep behaviors .
Such injuries may result in a fatal outcome .
Other complex sleep behaviors ( e . g . , preparing and eating food , making phone calls , or having sex ) have also been reported .
Patients usually do not remember these events .
Post - marketing reports have shown that complex sleep behaviors may occur with zolpidem alone at recommended dosages , with or without the concomitant use of alcohol or other central nervous system ( CNS ) depressants Discontinue ZOLPIMIST immediately if a patient experiences a complex sleep behavior .

Post - marketing reports have shown that complex sleep behaviors may occur with zolpidem alone at recommended dosages , with or without the concomitant use of alcohol or other central nervous system ( CNS ) depressants [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Discontinue ZOLPIMIST immediately if a patient experiences a complex sleep behavior .
5 . 2 CNS Depressant Effects and Next - Day Impairment Zolpidem tartrate , like other sedative - hypnotic drugs , has CNS - depressant effects .
Due to the rapid onset of action , ZOLPIMIST should only be administered immediately prior to going to bed .
Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness or motor coordination such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle after ingesting the drug , including potential impairment of the performance of such activities that may occur the day following administration of ZOLPIMIST .
Zolpidem tartrate showed additive effects when combined with alcohol and should not be taken with alcohol .
Patients should also be cautioned about possible combined effects with other CNS - depressant drugs .
Dosage adjustments may be necessary when ZOLPIMIST is administered with such agents because of the potentially additive effects .

Dosage adjustments may be necessary when ZOLPIMIST is administered with such agents because of the potentially additive effects .
Because ZOLPIMIST can cause drowsiness and a decreased level of consciousness , patients , particularly the elderly , are at higher risk of falls .
Because ZOLPIMIST can cause drowsiness and a decreased level of consciousness , patients , particularly the elderly , are at higher risk of falls .
5 . 3 Need to Evaluate for Co - Morbid Diagnoses Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and / or psychiatric disorder , symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient .
The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and / or medical illness that should be evaluated .
Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new thinking or behavioral abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder .
Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative - hypnotic drugs , including zolpidem .
5 . 4 Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid Reactions Rare cases of angioedema involving the tongue , glottis , or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of sedative - hypnotics , including zolpidem .
Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea , throat closing , or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis .
Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department .
If angioedema involves the throat , glottis , or larynx , airway obstruction may occur and be fatal .
Patients who develop angioedema after treatment with zolpidem should not be rechallenged with the drug .
5 . 5 Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes A variety of abnormal thinking and behavioral changes have been reported to occur in association with the use of sedative - hypnotics .
Some of these changes may be characterized by decreased inhibition ( e . g . , aggressiveness and extroversion that seemed out of character ) , similar to effects produced by alcohol and other CNS depressants .
Visual and auditory hallucinations have been reported as well as behavioral changes such as bizarre behavior , agitation , and depersonalization .
In controlled trials , < 1 % of adults with insomnia who received zolpidem reported hallucinations .
In a clinical trial , 7 . 4 % of pediatric patients with insomnia associated with attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , who received zolpidem , reported hallucinations .
[ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] It can rarely be determined with certainty whether a particular instance of the abnormal behaviors listed above is drug induced , spontaneous in origin , or a result of an underlying psychiatric or physical disorder .
Nonetheless , the emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation .
5 . 6 Withdrawal Effects Following the rapid dose decrease or abrupt discontinuation of sedative - hypnotics , there have been reports of signs and symptoms similar to those associated with withdrawal from other CNS - depressant drugs .
[ see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) ] 5 . 7 Special Populations Use in the elderly and / or debilitated patients : Impaired motor and / or cognitive performance after repeated exposure or unusual sensitivity to sedative - hypnotic drugs is a concern in the treatment of elderly and / or debilitated patients .
Therefore , the recommended ZOLPIMIST dosage is 5 mg in such patients to decrease the possibility of side effects .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] These patients should be closely monitored .
Use in patients with concomitant illness : Clinical experience with zolpidem tartrate in patients with concomitant systemic illness is limited .
Caution is advisable in using ZOLPIMIST in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses .
Although studies did not reveal respiratory depressant effects at hypnotic doses of zolpidem in normal subjects or in patients with mild to moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , a reduction in the Total Arousal Index together with a reduction in lowest oxygen saturation and increase in the times of oxygen desaturation below 80 % and 90 % was observed in patients with mild - to - moderate sleep apnea when treated with zolpidem tartrate ( 10 mg ) when compared to placebo .
Since sedative - hypnotics have the capacity to depress respiratory drive , precautions should be taken if ZOLPIMIST is prescribed to patients with compromised respiratory function .
Post - marketing reports of respiratory insufficiency , most of which involved patients with pre - existing respiratory impairment , have been received .
ZOLPIMIST should be used with caution in patients with sleep apnea syndrome or myasthenia gravis .
Data in end - stage renal failure patients repeatedly treated with zolpidem tartrate did not demonstrate drug accumulation or alterations in pharmacokinetic parameters .
No dosage adjustment in renally impaired patients is required ; however , these patients should be closely monitored .
[ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] A study in subjects with hepatic impairment did reveal prolonged elimination in this group ; therefore , treatment should be initiated with 5 mg in patients with hepatic compromise , and they should be closely monitored .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] Use in patients with depression : As with other sedative - hypnotic drugs , ZOLPIMIST should be administered with caution to patients exhibiting signs or symptoms of depression .
Suicidal tendencies may be present in such patients and protective measures may be required .
Intentional over - dosage is more common in this group of patients ; therefore , the least amount of drug that is feasible should be prescribed for the patient at any one time .
Use in pediatric patients : Safety and effectiveness of zolpidem have not been established in pediatric patients .
In an 8 - week study in pediatric patients ( 6 - 17 years of age ) with insomnia associated with ADHD , zolpidem did not decrease sleep latency compared to placebo .
Hallucinations were reported in 7 . 4 % of the pediatric patients who received zolpidem tartrate ; none of the pediatric patients who received placebo reported hallucinations .
[ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling : • Complex Sleep Behaviors [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • CNS - Depressant Effects and Next Day Impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Serious anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Withdrawal Effects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] Most commonly observed adverse reactions were : Short - term ( < 10 nights ) : Drowsiness , dizziness , and diarrhea Long - term ( 28 - 35 nights ) : Dizziness and drugged feelings ( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Aytu BioScience , Inc . at 1 - 855 - 298 - 8246 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does , however , provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating incidence rates .
Associated with discontinuation of treatment : Approximately 4 % of 1 , 701 patients who received zolpidem tartrate at all doses ( 1 . 25 to 90 mg ) in U . S . premarketing clinical trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction .
Reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation from U . S . trials were daytime drowsiness ( 0 . 5 % ) , dizziness ( 0 . 4 % ) , headache ( 0 . 5 % ) , nausea ( 0 . 6 % ) , and vomiting ( 0 . 5 % ) .
Approximately 4 % of 1 , 959 patients who received zolpidem at all doses ( 1 to 50 mg ) in similar foreign trials discontinued treatment because of an adverse reaction .
Reactions most commonly associated with discontinuation from these trials were daytime drowsiness ( 1 . 1 % ) , dizziness / vertigo ( 0 . 8 % ) , amnesia ( 0 . 5 % ) , nausea ( 0 . 5 % ) , headache ( 0 . 4 % ) , and falls ( 0 . 4 % ) .
Data from a clinical study in which selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) - treated patients were given zolpidem revealed that four of the seven discontinuations during double - blind treatment with zolpidem ( n = 95 ) were associated with impaired concentration , continuing or aggravated depression , and manic reaction ; one patient treated with placebo ( n = 97 ) was discontinued after an attempted suicide .
Most commonly observed adverse reactions in controlled trials : During short - term treatment ( up to 10 nights ) with zolpidem tartrate at doses up to 10 mg , the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of zolpidem and seen at statistically significant differences from placebo - treated patients were drowsiness ( reported by 2 % of zolpidem patients ) , dizziness ( 1 % ) , and diarrhea ( 1 % ) .
During longer - term treatment ( 28 to 35 nights ) with zolpidem tartrate at doses up to 10 mg , the most commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of zolpidem and seen at statistically significant differences from placebo - treated patients were dizziness ( 5 % ) and drugged feelings ( 3 % ) .
Adverse reactions observed at an incidence of ≥ 1 % in controlled trials : The following tables enumerate treatment - emergent adverse reactions frequencies that were observed at an incidence equal to 1 % or greater among patients with insomnia who received zolpidem tartrate and at a greater incidence than placebo in U . S . placebo - controlled trials .
Events reported by investigators were classified utilizing a modified World Health Organization ( WHO ) dictionary of preferred terms for the purpose of establishing event frequencies .
The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of side effects in the course of usual medical practice , in which patient characteristics and other factors differ from those that prevailed in these clinical trials .
Similarly , the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigators involving related drug products and uses , since each group of drug trials is conducted under a different set of conditions .
However , the cited figures provide the physician with a basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and nondrug factors to the incidence of side effects in the population studied .
The following table was derived from results of 11 placebo - controlled short - term U . S . efficacy trials involving zolpidem in doses ranging from 1 . 25 to 20 mg .
The table is limited to data from doses up to and including 10 mg , the highest dose recommended for use .
Incidence of Treatment - Emergent Adverse Reactions in Placebo - Controlled Clinical Trials Lasting up to 10 Nights ( Percentage of patients reporting ) Body System / Adverse Reaction * Zolpidem ( ≤ 10 mg ) ( n = 685 ) Placebo ( n = 473 ) * Reactions reported by at least 1 % of patients treated with zolpidem tartrate and at a greater frequency than placebo .
Central and Peripheral Nervous System Headache 7 6 Drowsiness 2 - Dizziness 1 - Gastrointestinal System Diarrhea 1 - The following table was derived from results of three placebo - controlled long - term efficacy trials involving zolpidem tartrate .
These trials involved patients with chronic insomnia who were treated for 28 to 35 nights with zolpidem tartrate at doses of 5 , 10 , or 15 mg .
The table is limited to data from doses up to and including 10 mg , the highest dose recommended for use .
The table includes only adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of at least 1 % for zolpidem tartrate patients .
Incidence of Treatment - Emergent Adverse Reactions in Placebo - Controlled Clinical Trials Lasting up to 35 Nights ( Percentage of patients reporting ) Body System / Adverse Reaction * Zolpidem ( ≤ 10 mg ) ( n = 152 ) Placebo ( n = 161 ) * Reactions reported by at least 1 % of patients treated with zolpidem tartrate and at a greater frequency than placebo .
Autonomic Nervous System Dry mouth 3 1 Body as a Whole Allergy 4 1 Back pain 3 2 Influenza - like symptoms 2 - Chest pain 1 - Cardiovascular System Palpitation 2 - Central and Peripheral Nervous System Drowsiness 8 5 Dizziness 5 1 Lethargy 3 1 Drugged feeling 3 - Lightheadedness 2 1 Depression 2 1 Abnormal dreams 1 - Amnesia 1 - Sleep disorder 1 - Gastrointestinal System Diarrhea 3 2 Abdominal pain 2 2 Constipation 2 1 Respiratory System Sinusitis 4 2 Pharyngitis 3 1 Skin and Appendages Rash 2 1 Dose relationship for adverse reactions : There is evidence from dose comparison trials suggesting a dose relationship for many of the adverse reactions associated with zolpidem tartrate use , particularly for certain CNS and gastrointestinal adverse reactions .
Oral tissue - related adverse reactions in ZOLPIMIST pharmacokinetics studies : The effect of chronic daily administrations of ZOLPIMIST on oral tissue has not been evaluated .
In pharmacokinetic studies conducted with ZOLPIMIST in healthy subjects , an oral soft tissue exam was performed , and no signs of oral irritation were noted following administration of single doses of ZOLPIMIST .
Adverse event incidence across the entire preapproval database : Zolpidem tartrate was administered to 3 , 660 subjects in clinical trials throughout the United States , Canada , and Europe .
Treatment - emergent adverse event associated with clinical trial participation were recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing .
To provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing treatment - emergent adverse events , similar types of untoward events were grouped into a smaller number of standardized event categories and classified utilizing a modified WHO dictionary of preferred terms .
The frequencies presented , therefore , represent the proportions of the 3 , 660 individuals exposed to zolpidem tartrate , at all doses , who experienced an event of the type cited on at least one occasion while receiving zolpidem tartrate .
All reported treatment - emergent adverse events are included , except those already listed in the table above of adverse events in placebo - controlled studies , those coding terms that are so general as to be uninformative , and those events where a drug cause was remote .
It is important to emphasize that , although the events reported did occur during treatment with zolpidem tartrate , they were not necessarily caused by it .
Adverse events are further classified within body system categories and enumerated in order of decreasing frequency using the following definitions : frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in greater than 1 / 100 subjects ; infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1 / 100 to 1 / 1 , 000 patients ; rare events are those occurring in less than 1 / 1 , 000 patients .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • CNS depressants : Enhanced CNS - depressant effects with combination use .
Use with alcohol causes additive psychomotor impairment .
( 7 . 1 ) • Imipramine : Decreased alertness observed with combination use .
( 7 . 1 ) • Chlorpromazine : Impaired alertness and psychomotor performance observed with combination use .
( 7 . 1 ) • Rifampin : Combination use decreases exposure to and effects of zolpidem .
( 7 . 2 ) • Ketoconazole : Combination use increases exposure to and effect of zolpidem .
( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 CNS - active Drugs Since the systematic evaluations of zolpidem in combination with other CNS - active drugs have been limited , careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of any CNS - active drug to be used with ZOLPIMIST .
Any drug with CNS - depressant effects could potentially enhance the CNS - depressant effects of zolpidem .
Zolpidem tartrate was evaluated in healthy subjects in single - dose interaction studies for several CNS drugs .
Imipramine in combination with zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction other than a 20 % decrease in peak levels of imipramine , but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness .
Similarly , chlorpromazine in combination with zolpidem tartrate produced no pharmacokinetic interaction , but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness and psychomotor performance .
A study involving haloperidol and zolpidem revealed no effect of haloperidol on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of zolpidem .
The lack of a drug interaction following single - dose administration does not predict a lack following chronic administration .
An additive effect on psychomotor performance between alcohol and zolpidem was demonstrated [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) ] .
A single - dose interaction study with zolpidem 10 mg and fluoxetine 20 mg at steady - state levels in male volunteers did not demonstrate any clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions .
When multiple doses of zolpidem and fluoxetine at steady - state concentrations were evaluated in healthy females , the only significant change was a 17 % increase in the zolpidem half - life ( t 1 / 2 ) .
There was no evidence of an additive effect in psychomotor performance .
Following five consecutive nightly doses of zolpidem 10 mg in the presence of sertraline 50 mg ( 17 consecutive daily doses at 7 : 00 am in healthy female volunteers ) , zolpidem maximum concentration ( C max ) was significantly higher ( 43 % ) and time to maximum concentration ( T max ) was significantly decreased ( 53 % ) .
Pharmacokinetics of sertraline and N - desmethylsertraline were unaffected by zolpidem .
7 . 2 Drugs that Affect Drug Metabolism via Cytochrome P450 Some compounds known to inhibit CYP3A may increase exposure to zolpidem .
The effect of inhibitors of other P450 enzymes has not been carefully evaluated .
A randomized , double - blind , crossover interaction study in ten healthy volunteers between itraconazole ( 200 mg once daily for 4 days ) and a single dose of zolpidem ( 10 mg ) given 5 hours after the last dose of itraconazole resulted in a 34 % increase in AUC 0 –∞ of zolpidem .
There were no significant pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem on subjective drowsiness , postural sway , or psychomotor performance .
A randomized , placebo - controlled , crossover interaction study in eight healthy female subjects between five consecutive daily doses of rifampin ( 600 mg ) and a single dose of zolpidem ( 20 mg ) given 17 hours after the last dose of rifampin showed significant reductions of the AUC ( – 73 % ) , C max ( – 58 % ) , and t 1 / 2 ( – 36 % ) of zolpidem , together with significant reductions in the pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem .
A randomized double - blind crossover interaction study in twelve healthy subjects showed that co - administration of single 5 mg dose of zolpidem tartrate with ketoconazole , a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor , given as 200 mg twice daily for 2 days increased C max of zolpidem by a factor of 1 . 3 and increased the total AUC of zolpidem by a factor of 1 . 7 compared to zolpidem alone and prolonged the t1 / 2 by approximately 30 % along with an increase in the pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem .
Caution should be used when ketoconazole is given with zolpidem and consideration should be given to using a lower dose of zolpidem when ketoconazole and zolpidem are given together .
Patients should be advised that use of ZOLPIMIST with ketoconazole may enhance the sedative effects .
7 . 3 Other Drugs with No Interaction with Zolpidem A study involving cimetidine / zolpidem and ranitidine / zolpidem combinations revealed no effect of either drug on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of zolpidem .
Zolpidem had no effect on digoxin pharmacokinetics and did not affect prothrombin time when given with warfarin in normal subjects .
7 . 4 Drug - laboratory Test Interactions Zolpidem is not known to interfere with commonly employed clinical laboratory tests .
In addition , clinical data indicate that zolpidem does not cross - react with benzodiazepines , opiates , barbiturates , cocaine , cannabinoids , or amphetamines in two standard urine drug screens .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Based on animal data , zolpidem may cause fetal harm .
( 8 . 1 ) • Nursing mothers : Infant exposure via breast milk .
( 8 . 3 ) • Pediatric use : Safety and effectiveness have not been established .
Hallucinations ( incidence rate 7 . 4 % ) and other psychiatric and / or nervous system adverse reactions were observed frequently in a study of pediatric patients with Attention - Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder .
( 5 . 7 , 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of ZOLPIMIST in pregnant women .
Studies in children to assess the effects of prenatal exposure to zolpidem have not been conducted ; however , cases of severe neonatal respiratory depression have been reported when zolpidem was used at the end of pregnancy , especially when taken with other CNS depressants .
Children born to mothers taking sedative - hypnotic drugs may be at risk for withdrawal symptoms during the postnatal period .
Neonatal flaccidity has also been reported in infants born to mothers who received sedative - hypnotic drugs during pregnancy .
ZOLPIMIST should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus .
Administration of zolpidem to pregnant rats and rabbits resulted in adverse effects on offspring development at doses greater than the zolpidem tartrate maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 10 mg / day ( approximately 8 mg / day zolpidem base ) ; however , teratogenicity was not observed .
When zolpidem was administered at oral doses of 4 , 20 , and 100 mg base / kg / day to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis , dose - related decreases in fetal skull ossification occurred at all but the lowest dose , which is approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg / m 2 basis .
In rabbits treated during organogenesis with zolpidem at oral doses of 1 , 4 , and 16 mg base / kg / day , increased embryo - fetal death and incomplete fetal skeletal ossification occurred at the highest dose tested .
The no - effect dose for embryo - fetal toxicity in rabbits is approximately 10 times the MRHD on a mg / m 2 basis .
Administration of zolpidem to rats at oral doses of 4 , 20 , and 100 mg base / kg / day during the latter part of pregnancy and throughout lactation produced decreased offspring growth and survival at all but the lowest dose , which is approximately 5 times the MRHD on a mg / m 2 basis .
8 . 2 Labor and Delivery ZOLPIMIST has no established use in labor and delivery .
[ see Pregnancy ( 8 . 1 ) ] 8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Zolpidem is excreted in human milk .
Studies in lactating mothers indicate that the t1 / 2 of zolpidem is similar to that in non - lactating women ( 2 . 6 ± 0 . 3 hours ) .
Between 0 . 004 % and 0 . 019 % of the total administered dose is excreted into milk .
The effect of zolpidem on the nursing infant is not known .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use ZOLPIMIST is not recommended for use in children .
Safety and effectiveness of zolpidem in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established .
In an 8 - week controlled study of pediatric patients ( 6 - 17 years of age ) with insomnia associated with attention - deficit / hyperactivity - disorder ( ADHD ) an oral solution of zolpidem tartrate dosed at 0 . 25 mg / kg at bedtime did not decrease sleep latency compared to placebo .
Psychiatric and nervous system disorders comprised the most frequent ( > 5 % ) treatment emergent adverse reactions observed with zolpidem versus placebo and included dizziness ( 23 . 5 % vs . 1 . 5 % ) , headache ( 12 . 5 % vs . 9 . 2 % ) , and hallucinations were reported in 7 % of the pediatric patients who received zolpidem ; none of the pediatric patients who received placebo reported hallucinations .
[ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] Ten patients on zolpidem ( 7 . 4 % ) discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use A total of 154 patients in U . S . controlled clinical trials and 897 patients in non - U . S . clinical trials who received oral zolpidem were ≥ 60 years of age .
For a pool of U . S . patients receiving zolpidem tartrate at doses of ≤ 10 mg or placebo , there were three adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of at least 3 % for zolpidem and for which the zolpidem incidence was at least twice the placebo incidence ( i . e . , they could be considered drug related ) .
Adverse Reaction Zolpidem Placebo Dizziness 3 % 0 % Drowsiness 5 % 2 % Diarrhea 3 % 1 % A total of 30 / 1 , 959 ( 1 . 5 % ) non - U . S . patients receiving zolpidem reported falls , including 28 / 30 ( 93 % ) who were ≥ 70 years of age .
Of these 28 patients , 23 ( 82 % ) were receiving zolpidem doses > 10 mg .
A total of 24 / 1 , 959 ( 1 . 2 % ) non - U . S . patients receiving zolpidem reported confusion , including 18 / 24 ( 75 % ) who were ≥ 70 years of age .
Of these 18 patients , 14 ( 78 % ) were receiving zolpidem doses > 10 mg .
The dose of ZOLPIMIST in elderly patients is 5 mg to minimize the adverse effects related to impaired motor and / or cognitive performance and unusual sensitivity to sedative - hypnotic drugs .
[ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] 9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9 . 1 Controlled Substance Zolpidem tartrate is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by federal regulation .
9 . 2 Abuse Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance .
Abuse is characterized by misuse of the drug for non - medical purposes , often in combination with other psychoactive substances .
Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in a diminution of one or more of the drug effects over time .
Tolerance may occur to both desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects .
Addiction is a primary , chronic , neurobiological disease with genetic , psychosocial , and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations .
It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following : impaired control over drug use , compulsive use , continued use despite harm , and craving .
Drug addiction is a treatable disease , using a multidisciplinary approach , but relapse is common .
Studies of abuse potential in former drug abusers found that the effects of single doses of zolpidem tartrate 40 mg were similar , but not identical , to diazepam 20 mg , while zolpidem tartrate 10 mg was difficult to distinguish from placebo .
Because persons with a history of addiction to , or abuse of , drugs or alcohol are at increased risk for misuse , abuse and addiction of zolpidem , they should be monitored carefully when receiving zolpidem or any other hypnotic .
9 . 3 Dependence Physical dependence is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation , rapid dose reduction , decreasing blood level of the drug , and / or administration of an antagonist .
Sedative - hypnotics have produced withdrawal signs and symptoms following abrupt discontinuation .
These reported symptoms range from mild dysphoria and insomnia to a withdrawal syndrome that may include abdominal and muscle cramps , vomiting , sweating , tremors , and convulsions .
The following adverse reactions which are considered to meet the DSM - III - R criteria for uncomplicated sedative - hypnotic withdrawal were reported during U . S . clinical trials following placebo substitution occurring within 48 hours following last zolpidem treatment : fatigue , nausea , flushing , lightheadedness , uncontrolled crying , emesis , stomach cramps , panic attack , nervousness , and abdominal discomfort .
These reported adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of 1 % or less .
However , available data cannot provide a reliable estimate of the incidence , if any , of dependence during treatment at recommended doses .
Post - marketing reports of abuse , dependence , and withdrawal have been received .
10 OVERDOSAGE 10 . 1 Signs and Symptoms In post - marketing experience of overdose with zolpidem tartrate alone , or in combination with CNS - depressant agents , impairment of consciousness ranging from somnolence to coma , cardiovascular and / or respiratory compromise , and fatal outcomes have been reported .
10 . 2 Recommended Treatment General symptomatic and supportive measures should be used along with immediate gastric lavage where appropriate .
Intravenous fluids should be administered as needed .
Zolpidem ' s sedative - hypnotic effect was shown to be reduced by flumazenil and therefore may be useful ; however , flumazenil administration may contribute to the appearance of neurological symptoms ( convulsions ) .
As in all cases of drug overdose , respiration , pulse , blood pressure , and other appropriate signs should be monitored , and general supportive measures employed .
Hypotension and CNS depression should be monitored and treated by appropriate medical intervention .
Sedating drugs should be withheld following zolpidem overdosage , even if excitation occurs .
The value of dialysis in the treatment of overdosage has not been determined , although hemodialysis studies in patients with renal failure receiving therapeutic doses have demonstrated that zolpidem is not dialyzable .
As with the management of all overdosage , the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered .
The physician may wish to consider contacting a poison control center for up - to - date information on the management of hypnotic drug product overdosage .
11 DESCRIPTION ZOLPIMIST ( zolpidem tartrate ) is a gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) A agonist of the imidazopyridine class .
Chemically , zolpidem is N , N , 6 - trimethyl - 2 - p - tolylimidazo [ 1 , 2 - a ] pyridine - 3 - acetamide l - ( + ) - tartrate ( 2 : 1 ) .
It has the following structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Zolpidem tartrate is a white to off - white crystalline powder that is sparingly soluble in water , alcohol , and propylene glycol .
It has a molecular weight of 764 . 89 .
ZOLPIMIST is available as an oral solution designed to be sprayed directly into the mouth over the tongue .
Each metered actuation of ZOLPIMIST delivers 5 mg of zolpidem tartrate in 100 μL .
Two actuations deliver 10 mg of zolpidem tartrate .
ZOLPIMIST includes the following inactive ingredients : artificial cherry flavor , benzoic acid , citric acid monohydrate , hydrochloric acid , neotame , propylene glycol , and purified water .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Zolpidem , the active moiety of zolpidem tartrate , is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines , barbiturates , or other drugs with known hypnotic properties .
It interacts with a GABA - BZ receptor complex and shares some of the pharmacological properties of the benzodiazepines .
In contrast to the benzodiazepines which non - selectively bind to and activate all BZ receptor subtypes , zolpidem in vitro binds the BZ 1 receptor preferentially with a high affinity ratio of the α 1 / α 5 subunits .
This selective binding of zolpidem on the BZ 1 receptor is not absolute , but it may explain the relative absence of myorelaxant and anticonvulsant effects in animal studies as well as the preservation of deep sleep ( stages 3 and 4 ) in human studies of zolpidem at hypnotic doses .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics ZOLPIMIST ( zolpidem tartrate ) Oral Spray is bioequivalent to Ambien ® tablets ( Sanofi - Aventis ) .
The pharmacokinetic profile of ZOLPIMIST is characterized by rapid absorption from the oral mucosa and gastrointestinal tract , and a short elimination t 1 / 2 in healthy subjects .
In a single - dose crossover study in 10 healthy young ( 18 - 40 years of age ) male subjects administered 2 . 5 , 5 , and 10 mg ZOLPIMIST , the results demonstrated a linear relationship to dose for mean C max and AUC 0 - ∞ over the range of doses administered in the study .
In a single - dose crossover study in 43 healthy young ( 18 - 45 years of age ) subjects administered 5 and 10 mg ZOLPIMIST , the means for C max were 114 ( range : 19 to 197 ) and 210 ng / mL ( range : 77 to 401 ) , respectively , occurring at a mean time to maximum concentration ( T max ) of approximately 0 . 9 hours for both .
The mean zolpidem t 1 / 2 was 2 . 7 ( range : 1 . 7 to 5 . 0 ) and 3 . 0 hours ( range : 1 . 7 to 8 . 4 ) , for 5 and 10 mg ZOLPIMIST , respectively .
In the same study , the means for C max were 123 ( range : 53 to 221 ) and 219 ng / mL ( range : 101 to 446 ) for 5 and 10 mg Ambien ® tablets , respectively , occurring at a mean T max of 0 . 9 and 1 . 0 hours , respectively .
The mean zolpidem t 1 / 2 was 2 . 8 ( range : 1 . 5 to 6 . 0 ) and 3 . 1 hours ( range : 1 . 1 to 8 . 6 ) for the 5 and 10 mg Ambien ® tablets , respectively .
Zolpidem is converted to inactive metabolites that are eliminated primarily by renal excretion .
Total protein binding for zolpidem was found to be 92 . 5 ± 0 . 1 % and remained constant , independent of concentration between 40 and 790 ng / mL .
Zolpidem did not accumulate in young adults following nightly dosing with 20 mg zolpidem tartrate for 2 weeks .
A food - effect crossover study in 14 healthy young ( 18 - 45 years of age ) male subjects compared the pharmacokinetics of ZOLPIMIST 10 mg when administered while fasting at least 8 hours or 5 minutes after eating a standard high - fat meal .
Results demonstrated that with food , mean AUC 0 - ∞ and C max were decreased by 27 % and 58 % , respectively , while mean T max was prolonged by 225 % ( from 0 . 8 to 2 . 6 hours ) .
These results suggest that , for faster sleep onset , as with all zolpidem products , ZOLPIMIST should not be administered with or immediately after a meal .
Special Populations : Elderly : In the elderly , the dose for zolpidem tartrate should be 5 mg [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
This recommendation is based on several studies in which the mean C max , t 1 / 2 , and AUC were significantly increased when compared to results in young adults administered zolpidem tartrate .
In a pharmacokinetic study of 24 elderly ( ≥ 65 years of age ) subjects administered 5 mg ZOLPIMIST , the means for C max and AUC were 134 ng / mL and 493 ng ∙ hr / mL respectively , following administration of a single 5 mg oral dose of ZOLPIMIST .
Zolpidem tartrate did not accumulate in elderly subjects following nightly oral dosing of 10 mg for 1 week .
Hepatic impairment : The pharmacokinetics of zolpidem in eight patients with chronic hepatic insufficiency were compared to results in healthy subjects .
Following a single 20 mg oral zolpidem tartrate dose , mean C max and AUC were found to be two times ( 250 vs 499 ng / mL ) and five times ( 788 vs 4 , 203 ng ∙ hr / mL ) higher , respectively , in hepatically compromised patients .
T max did not change .
The mean t 1 / 2 in cirrhotic patients of 9 . 9 hours ( range : 4 . 1 to 25 . 8 hours ) was greater than that observed in normal subjects of 2 . 2 hours ( range : 1 . 6 to 2 . 4 hours ) .
Dosing should be modified accordingly in patients with hepatic insufficiency .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] Renal impairment : The pharmacokinetics of zolpidem were studied in 11 patients with end - stage renal failure ( mean Cl Cr = 6 . 5 ± 1 . 5 mL / min ) undergoing hemodialysis three times a week , who were dosed with zolpidem tartrate 10 mg orally each day for 14 or 21 days .
No statistically significant differences were observed for C max , T max , t 1 / 2 , and AUC between the first and last day of drug administration when baseline concentration adjustments were made .
Zolpidem was not hemodialyzable .
No accumulation of unchanged drug appeared after 14 or 21 days .
Zolpidem pharmacokinetics were not significantly different in renally impaired patients .
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with compromised renal function .
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with compromised renal function .
However , as a general precaution , these patients should be closely monitored .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis : Zolpidem was administered to mice and rats for 2 years at oral doses of 4 , 18 , and 80 mg base / kg / day .
In mice , these doses are approximately 2 . 5 , 10 , and 50 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 10 mg / day ( 8 mg zolpidem base ) on mg / m 2 basis .
In rats , these doses are approximately 5 , 20 , and 100 times the MRHD on a mg / m 2 basis .
No evidence of carcinogenic potential was observed in mice .
In rats , renal tumors ( lipoma , liposarcoma ) were seen at the mid - and high doses .
Mutagenesis : Zolpidem was negative in in vitro ( bacterial reverse mutation , mouse lymphoma , and chromosomal aberration ) and in vivo ( mouse micronucleus ) genetic toxicology assays .
Impairment of fertility : Oral administration of zolpidem ( doses of 4 , 20 , and 100 mg base / kg / day ) to rats prior to and during mating , and continuing in females through postpartum day 25 , resulted in irregular estrus cycles and prolonged precoital intervals at the highest dose tested .
The no - effect dose for these findings is approximately 24 times the MRHD on a mg / m 2 basis .
There was no impairment of fertility at any dose tested .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Transient Insomnia Normal adults experiencing transient insomnia ( n = 462 ) during the first night in a sleep laboratory were evaluated in a double - blind , parallel group , single - night trial comparing two doses of zolpidem ( 7 . 5 and 10 mg ) and placebo .
Both zolpidem doses were superior to placebo on objective ( polysomnographic ) measures of sleep latency , sleep duration , and number of awakenings .
Normal elderly adults ( mean age 68 ) experiencing transient insomnia ( n = 35 ) during the first two nights in a sleep laboratory were evaluated in a double - blind , crossover , 2 - night trial comparing four doses of zolpidem ( 5 , 10 , 15 , and 20 mg ) and placebo .
All zolpidem doses were superior to placebo on the two primary PSG parameters ( sleep latency and efficiency ) and all four subjective outcome measures ( sleep duration , sleep latency , number of awakenings , and sleep quality ) .
14 . 2 Chronic Insomnia Zolpidem was evaluated in two controlled studies for the treatment of patients with chronic insomnia ( most closely resembling primary insomnia , as defined in the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , DSM - IV ™ ) .
Adult outpatients with chronic insomnia ( n = 75 ) were evaluated in a double - blind , parallel group , 5 - week trial comparing two doses of zolpidem tartrate and placebo .
On objective ( polysomnographic ) measures of sleep latency and sleep efficiency , zolpidem 10 mg was superior to placebo on sleep latency for the first 4 weeks and on sleep efficiency for weeks 2 and 4 .
Zolpidem was comparable to placebo on number of awakenings at both doses studied .
Adult outpatients ( n = 141 ) with chronic insomnia were also evaluated , in a double - blind , parallel group , 4 - week trial comparing two doses of zolpidem and placebo .
Zolpidem 10 mg was superior to placebo on a subjective measure of sleep latency for all 4 weeks , and on subjective measures of total sleep time , number of awakenings , and sleep quality for the first treatment week .
Increased wakefulness during the last third of the night as measured by polysomnography has not been observed in clinical trials with zolpidem .
14 . 3 Studies Pertinent to Safety Concerns for Sedative - hypnotic Drugs Next - day residual effects : Next - day residual effects of zolpidem tartrate were evaluated in seven studies involving normal subjects .
In three studies in adults ( including one study in a phase advance model of transient insomnia ) and in one study in elderly subjects , a small but statistically significant decrease in performance was observed in the Digit Symbol Substitution Test ( DSST ) when compared to placebo .
Studies of zolpidem tartrate in non - elderly patients with insomnia did not detect evidence of next - day residual effects using the DSST , the Multiple Sleep Latency Test ( MSLT ) , and patient ratings of alertness .
Rebound effects : There was no objective ( polysomnographic ) evidence of rebound insomnia at recommended doses seen in studies evaluating sleep on the nights following discontinuation of zolpidem tartrate .
There was subjective evidence of impaired sleep in the elderly on the first post - treatment night at doses above the recommended elderly dose of 5 mg .
Memory impairment : Controlled studies in adults utilizing objective measures of memory yielded no consistent evidence of next - day memory impairment following the administration of zolpidem tartrate .
However , in one study involving zolpidem doses of 10 and 20 mg , there was a significant decrease in next - morning recall of information presented to subjects during peak drug effect ( 90 minutes post - dose ) ( i . e . , these subjects experienced anterograde amnesia ) .
There was also subjective evidence from adverse event data for anterograde amnesia occurring in association with the administration of zolpidem tartrate , predominantly at doses above 10 mg .
Effects on sleep stages : In studies that measured the percentage of sleep time spent in each sleep stage , zolpidem tartrate has generally been shown to preserve sleep stages .
Sleep time spent in stages 3 and 4 ( deep sleep ) was found comparable to placebo with only inconsistent , minor changes in REM ( paradoxical ) sleep at the recommended dose .
