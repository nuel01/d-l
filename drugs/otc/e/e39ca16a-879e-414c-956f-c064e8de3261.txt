( 5 . 6 ) 5 . 1 Hypokalemia , Fluid Retention , and Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions Due to Mineralocorticoid Excess Abiraterone acetate tablets may cause hypertension , hypokalemia , and fluid retention as a consequence of increased mineralocorticoid levels resulting from CYP17 inhibition [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor patients for hypertension , hypokalemia , and fluid retention at least once a month .
Control hypertension and correct hypokalemia before and during treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets .
In the combined data from 4 placebo - controlled trials using prednisone 5 mg twice daily in combination with 1 , 000 mg abiraterone acetate daily , grades 3 - 4 hypokalemia were detected in 4 % of patients on the abiraterone acetate tablets arm and 2 % of patients on the placebo arm .
Grades 3 - 4 hypertension were observed in 2 % of patients each arm and grades 3 - 4 fluid retention in 1 % of patients each arm .
In LATITUDE ( a randomized placebo - controlled , multicenter clinical trial ) , which used prednisone 5 mg daily in combination with 1 , 000 mg abiraterone acetate daily , grades 3 - 4 hypokalemia were detected in 10 % of patients on the abiraterone acetate tablets arm and 1 % of patients on the placebo arm , grades 3 - 4 hypertension were observed in 20 % of patients on the abiraterone acetate tablets arm and 10 % of patients on the placebo arm .
Grades 3 - 4 fluid retention occurred in 1 % of patients each arm [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Closely monitor patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure , hypokalemia or fluid retention , such as those with heart failure , recent myocardial infarction , cardiovascular disease , or ventricular arrhythmia .
In postmarketing experience , QT prolongation and Torsades de Pointes have been observed in patients who develop hypokalemia while taking abiraterone acetate tablets .
The safety of abiraterone acetate tablets in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < 50 % or New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III or IV heart failure ( in COU - AA - 301 ) or NYHA Class II to IV heart failure ( in COU - AA - 302 and LATITUDE ) has not been established because these patients were excluded from these randomized clinical trials [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
5 . 2 Adrenocortical Insufficiency Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0 . 3 % of 2230 patients taking abiraterone acetate tablets and in 0 . 1 % of 1763 patients taking placebo in the combined data of the 5 randomized , placebo - controlled clinical studies .
Adrenocortical insufficiency was reported in patients receiving abiraterone acetate tablets in combination with prednisone , following interruption of daily steroids and / or with concurrent infection or stress .
Monitor patients for symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency , particularly if patients are withdrawn from prednisone , have prednisone dose reductions , or experience unusual stress .
Symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency may be masked by adverse reactions associated with mineralocorticoid excess seen in patients treated with abiraterone acetate tablets .
If clinically indicated , perform appropriate tests to confirm the diagnosis of adrenocortical insufficiency .
Increased dosage of corticosteroids may be indicated before , during and after stressful situations [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 3 Hepatotoxicity In postmarketing experience , there have been abiraterone acetate tablets - associated severe hepatic toxicity , including fulminant hepatitis , acute liver failure and deaths [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
In the combined data of 5 randomized clinical trials , grade 3 - 4 ALT or AST increases ( at least 5 x ULN ) were reported in 6 % of 2230 patients who received abiraterone acetate tablets , typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment .
Patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver test elevation than those beginning with normal values .
Treatment discontinuation due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic function occurred in 1 . 1 % of 2230 patients taking abiraterone acetate tablets .
In these clinical trials , no deaths clearly related to abiraterone acetate tablets were reported due to hepatotoxicity events .
Measure serum transaminases ( ALT and AST ) and bilirubin levels prior to starting treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets , every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter .
In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment receiving a reduced abiraterone acetate tablets dose of 250 mg , measure ALT , AST , and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment , every week for the first month , every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter .
Promptly measure serum total bilirubin , AST , and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop .
Elevations of AST , ALT , or bilirubin from the patient ’ s baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring .
If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN , or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN , interrupt abiraterone acetate tablets treatment and closely monitor liver function .
Re - treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets at a reduced dose level may take place only after return of liver function tests to the patient ’ s baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2 . 5 x ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1 . 5 x ULN [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Permanently discontinue abiraterone acetate tablets for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 x ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
The safety of abiraterone acetate tablets re - treatment of patients who develop AST or ALT greater than or equal to 20 x ULN and / or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10 x ULN is unknown .
5 . 4 Increased Fractures and Mortality in Combination with Radium Ra 223 Dichloride Abiraterone acetate tablets plus prednisone / prednisolone are not recommended for use in combination with radium Ra 223 dichloride outside of clinical trials .
The clinical efficacy and safety of concurrent initiation of abiraterone acetate tablets plus prednisone / prednisolone and radium Ra 223 dichloride was assessed in a randomized , placebo - controlled multicenter study ( ERA - 223 trial ) in 806 patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic castration - resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases .
The study was unblinded early based on an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommendation .
At the primary analysis , increased incidences of fractures ( 28 . 6 % vs 11 . 4 % ) and deaths ( 38 . 5 % vs 35 . 5 % ) have been observed in patients who received abiraterone acetate tablets plus prednisone / prednisolone in combination with radium Ra 223 dichloride compared to patients who received placebo in combination with abiraterone acetate tablets plus prednisone / prednisolone .
5 . 5 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity The safety and efficacy of abiraterone acetate tablets have not been established in females .
Based on animal reproductive studies and mechanism of action , abiraterone acetate tablets can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female .
In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of abiraterone acetate to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at maternal exposures approximately ≥ 0 . 03 times the human exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended dose .
Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets and for 3 weeks after the last dose of abiraterone acetate tablets [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .
Abiraterone acetate tablets should not be handled by females who are or may become pregnant [ see How Supplied / Storage and Handling ( 16 ) ] .
5 . 6 Hypoglycemia Severe hypoglycemia has been reported when abiraterone acetate tablets were administered to patients with pre - existing diabetes receiving medications containing thiazolidinediones ( including pioglitazone ) or repaglinide [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Monitor blood glucose in patients with diabetes during and after discontinuation of treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets .
Assess if antidiabetic drug dosage needs to be adjusted to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia .

11 DESCRIPTION Abiraterone acetate , the active ingredient of abiraterone acetate tablets , USP is the acetyl ester of abiraterone .
Abiraterone is an inhibitor of CYP17 ( 17α - hydroxylase / C17 , 20 - lyase ) .
Each abiraterone acetate tablet contains either 250 mg or 500 mg of abiraterone acetate .
Abiraterone acetate is designated chemically as 17 - ( Pyridin - 3 - yl ) androsta - 5 , 16 - dien - 3β - yl acetate and its structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Abiraterone acetate , USP is a white to off - white , non - hygroscopic , powder .
Its molecular formula is C26H33NO2 and it has a molecular weight of 391 . 55 .
Abiraterone acetate is a lipophilic compound with an octanol - water partition coefficient of 5 . 12 ( Log P ) and is practically insoluble in water .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Abiraterone acetate is converted in vivo to abiraterone , an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor , that inhibits 17 α - hydroxylase / C17 , 20 - lyase ( CYP17 ) .
This enzyme is expressed in testicular , adrenal , and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis .
CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions : 1 ) the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17α - hydroxy derivatives by 17α - hydroxylase activity and 2 ) the subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) and androstenedione , respectively , by C17 , 20 lyase activity .
DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone .
Inhibition of CYP17 by abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels .
Androgen deprivation therapies , such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy , decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor .
Abiraterone acetate tablets decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo - controlled clinical trial .
It is not necessary to monitor the effect of abiraterone acetate tablets on serum testosterone levels .
Changes in serum prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) levels may be observed but have not been shown to correlate with clinical benefit in individual patients .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a multi - center , open - label , single - arm trial , 33 patients with metastatic CRPC received abiraterone acetate tablets orally at a dose of 1 , 000 mg once daily at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal in combination with prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily .
Assessments up to Cycle 2 Day 2 showed no large changes in the QTc interval ( i . e . , > 20 ms ) from baseline .
However , small increases in the QTc interval ( i . e . , < 10 ms ) due to abiraterone acetate cannot be excluded due to study design limitations .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following administration of abiraterone acetate , the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone have been studied in healthy subjects and in patients with metastatic CRPC .
In vivo , abiraterone acetate is converted to abiraterone .
In clinical studies , abiraterone acetate plasma concentrations were below detectable levels ( < 0 . 2 ng / mL ) in > 99 % of the analyzed samples .
Absorption Following oral administration of abiraterone acetate to patients with metastatic CRPC , the median time to reach maximum plasma abiraterone concentrations is 2 hours .
Abiraterone accumulation is observed at steady - state , with a 2 - fold higher exposure ( steady - state AUC ) compared to a single 1 , 000 mg dose of abiraterone acetate .
At the dose of 1 , 000 mg daily in patients with metastatic CRPC , steady - state values ( mean ± SD ) of Cmax were 226 ± 178 ng / mL and of AUC were 993 ± 639 ng • hr / mL .
No major deviation from dose proportionality was observed in the dose range of 250 mg to 1 , 000 mg .
However , the exposure was not significantly increased when the dose was doubled from 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 mg ( 8 % increase in the mean AUC ) .
Effect of Food Systemic exposure of abiraterone is increased when abiraterone acetate is administered with food .
In healthy subjects abiraterone Cmax and AUC0 - ∞ were approximately 7 - and 5 - fold higher , respectively , when a single dose of abiraterone acetate was administered with a low - fat meal ( 7 % fat , 300 calories ) and approximately 17 - and 10 - fold higher , respectively , when a single dose of abiraterone acetate was administered with a high - fat ( 57 % fat , 825 calories ) meal compared to overnight fasting .
Abiraterone AUC0 - ∞ was approximately 7 - fold or 1 . 6 - fold higher , respectively , when a single dose of abiraterone acetate was administered 2 hours after or 1 hour before a medium fat meal ( 25 % fat , 491 calories ) compared to overnight fasting .
Systemic exposures of abiraterone in patients with metastatic CRPC , after repeated dosing of abiraterone acetate were similar when abiraterone acetate was taken with low - fat meals for 7 days and increased approximately 2 - fold when taken with high - fat meals for 7 days compared to when taken at least 2 hours after a meal and at least 1 hour before a meal for 7 days .
Given the normal variation in the content and composition of meals , taking abiraterone acetate tablets with meals has the potential to result in increased and highly variable exposures .
Distribution Abiraterone is highly bound ( > 99 % ) to the human plasma proteins , albumin and alpha - 1 acid glycoprotein .
The apparent steady - state volume of distribution ( mean ± SD ) is 19 , 669 ± 13 , 358 L . Elimination In patients with metastatic CRPC , the mean terminal half - life of abiraterone in plasma ( mean ± SD ) is 12 ± 5 hours .
Metabolism Following oral administration of 14 C - abiraterone acetate as capsules , abiraterone acetate is hydrolyzed to abiraterone ( active metabolite ) .
The conversion is likely through esterase activity ( the esterases have not been identified ) and is not CYP mediated .
The two main circulating metabolites of abiraterone in human plasma are abiraterone sulphate ( inactive ) and N - oxide abiraterone sulphate ( inactive ) , which account for about 43 % of exposure each .
CYP3A4 and SULT2A1 are the enzymes involved in the formation of N - oxide abiraterone sulphate and SULT2A1 is involved in the formation of abiraterone sulphate .
Excretion Following oral administration of 14 C - abiraterone acetate , approximately 88 % of the radioactive dose is recovered in feces and approximately 5 % in urine .
The major compounds present in feces are unchanged abiraterone acetate and abiraterone ( approximately 55 % and 22 % of the administered dose , respectively ) .
Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of abiraterone was examined in subjects with baseline mild ( N = 8 ) or moderate ( N = 8 ) hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A and B , respectively ) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function .
Systemic exposure to abiraterone after a single oral 1 , 000 mg dose given under fasting conditions increased approximately 1 . 1 - fold and 3 . 6 - fold in subjects with mild and moderate baseline hepatic impairment , respectively .
The mean half - life of abiraterone is prolonged to approximately 18 hours in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and to approximately 19 hours in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment .
In another trial , the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in subjects with baseline severe ( N = 8 ) hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function .
The systemic exposure ( AUC ) of abiraterone increased by approximately 7 - fold in subjects with severe baseline hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function .
In addition , the mean protein binding was found to be lower in the severe hepatic impairment group compared to the normal hepatic function group , which resulted in a two - fold increase in the fraction of free drug in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in patients with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) on a stable hemodialysis schedule ( N = 8 ) and in matched control subjects with normal renal function ( N = 8 ) .
In the ESRD cohort of the trial , a single 1 , 000 mg abiraterone acetate tablets dose was given under fasting conditions 1 hour after dialysis , and samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected up to 96 hours post dose .
Systemic exposure to abiraterone after a single oral 1 , 000 mg dose did not increase in subjects with end - stage renal disease on dialysis , compared to subjects with normal renal function .
Drug Interactions Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Other Drugs on Abiraterone Acetate Tablets Strong CYP3A4 inducers : In a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study of healthy subjects pretreated with a strong CYP3A4 inducer ( rifampin , 600 mg daily for 6 days ) followed by a single dose of abiraterone acetate 1 , 000 mg , the mean plasma AUC ∞ of abiraterone was decreased by 55 % .
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors : Co - administration of ketoconazole , a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 , had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone .
Effect of Abiraterone Acetate Tablets on Other Drugs CYP2D6 substrates : The Cmax and AUC of dextromethorphan ( CYP2D6 substrate ) were increased 2 . 8 - and 2 . 9 - fold , respectively when dextromethorphan 30 mg was given with abiraterone acetate 1 , 000 mg daily ( plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily ) .
The AUC for dextrorphan , the active metabolite of dextromethorphan , increased approximately 1 . 3 fold .
CYP1A2 substrates : When abiraterone acetate 1 , 000 mg daily ( plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily ) was given with a single dose of 100 mg theophylline ( CYP1A2 substrate ) , no increase in systemic exposure of theophylline was observed .
CYP2C8 substrates : The AUC of pioglitazone ( CYP2C8 substrate ) was increased by 46 % when pioglitazone was given to healthy subjects with a single dose of 1 , 000 mg abiraterone acetate .
In Vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) Enzymes : Abiraterone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and has the potential to inhibit CYP1A2 , CYP2D6 , CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 / 5 .
Transporter Systems In vitro studies show that at clinically relevant concentrations , abiraterone acetate and abiraterone are not substrates of P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) and that abiraterone acetate is an inhibitor of P - gp .
In vitro , abiraterone and its major metabolites were shown to inhibit the hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1 .
There are no clinical data available to confirm transporter based interaction .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility A two - year carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats at oral abiraterone acetate doses of 5 , 15 , and 50 mg / kg / day for males and 15 , 50 , and 150 mg / kg / day for females .
Abiraterone acetate increased the combined incidence of interstitial cell adenomas and carcinomas in the testes at all dose levels tested .
This finding is considered to be related to the pharmacological activity of abiraterone .
Rats are regarded as more sensitive than humans to developing interstitial cell tumors in the testes .
Abiraterone acetate was not carcinogenic in female rats at exposure levels up to 0 . 8 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC .
Abiraterone acetate was not carcinogenic in a 6 - month study in the transgenic ( Tg . rasH2 ) mouse .
Abiraterone acetate and abiraterone was not mutagenic in an in vitro microbial mutagenesis ( Ames ) assay or clastogenic in an in vitro cytogenetic assay using primary human lymphocytes or an in vivo rat micronucleus assay .
In repeat - dose toxicity studies in male rats ( 13 - and 26 - weeks ) and monkeys ( 39 - weeks ) , atrophy , aspermia / hypospermia , and hyperplasia in the reproductive system were observed at ≥ 50 mg / kg / day in rats and ≥ 250 mg / kg / day in monkeys and were consistent with the antiandrogenic pharmacological activity of abiraterone .
These effects were observed in rats at systemic exposures similar to humans and in monkeys at exposures approximately 0 . 6 times the AUC in humans .
In a fertility study in male rats , reduced organ weights of the reproductive system , sperm counts , sperm motility , altered sperm morphology and decreased fertility were observed in animals dosed for 4 weeks at ≥ 30 mg / kg / day orally .
Mating of untreated females with males that received 30 mg / kg / day oral abiraterone acetate resulted in a reduced number of corpora lutea , implantations and live embryos and an increased incidence of pre - implantation loss .
Effects on male rats were reversible after 16 weeks from the last abiraterone acetate administration .
In a fertility study in female rats , animals dosed orally for 2 weeks until day 7 of pregnancy at ≥ 30 mg / kg / day had an increased incidence of irregular or extended estrous cycles and pre - implantation loss ( 300 mg / kg / day ) .
There were no differences in mating , fertility , and litter parameters in female rats that received abiraterone acetate .
Effects on female rats were reversible after 4 weeks from the last abiraterone acetate administration .
The dose of 30 mg / kg / day in rats is approximately 0 . 3 times the recommended dose of 1 , 000 mg / day based on body surface area .
In 13 - and 26 - week studies in rats and 13 - and 39 - week studies in monkeys , a reduction in circulating testosterone levels occurred with abiraterone acetate at approximately one half the human clinical exposure based on AUC .
As a result , decreases in organ weights and toxicities were observed in the male and female reproductive system , adrenal glands , liver , pituitary ( rats only ) , and male mammary glands .
The changes in the reproductive organs are consistent with the antiandrogenic pharmacological activity of abiraterone acetate .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology A dose - dependent increase in cataracts was observed in rats after daily oral abiraterone acetate administration for 26 weeks starting at ≥ 50 mg / kg / day ( similar to the human clinical exposure based on AUC ) .
In a 39 - week monkey study with daily oral abiraterone acetate administration , no cataracts were observed at higher doses ( 2 times greater than the clinical exposure based on AUC ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy and safety of abiraterone acetate tablets with prednisone was established in three randomized placebo - controlled international clinical studies .
All patients in these studies received a GnRH analog or had prior bilateral orchiectomy .
Patients with prior ketoconazole treatment for prostate cancer and a history of adrenal gland or pituitary disorders were excluded from these trials .
Concurrent use of spironolactone was not allowed during the study period .
COU - AA - 301 : Patients with Metastatic CRPC who had Received Prior Docetaxel Chemotherapy : In COU - AA - 301 ( NCT00638690 ) , a total of 1195 patients were randomized 2 : 1 to receive either abiraterone acetate tablets orally at a dose of 1 , 000 mg once daily in combination with prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily ( N = 797 ) or placebo once daily plus prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily ( N = 398 ) .
Patients randomized to either arm were to continue treatment until disease progression ( defined as a 25 % increase in PSA over the patient ’ s baseline / nadir together with protocol - defined radiographic progression and symptomatic or clinical progression ) , initiation of new treatment , unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal .
The following patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms .
The median age was 69 years ( range 39 - 95 ) and the racial distribution was 93 % Caucasian , 3 . 6 % Black , 1 . 7 % Asian , and 1 . 6 % Other .
Eighty - nine percent of patients enrolled had an ECOG performance status score of 0 - 1 and 45 % had a Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form score of ≥ 4 ( patient ’ s reported worst pain over the previous 24 hours ) .
Ninety percent of patients had metastases in bone and 30 % had visceral involvement .
Seventy percent of patients had radiographic evidence of disease progression and 30 % had PSA - only progression .
Seventy percent of patients had previously received one cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen and 30 % received two regimens .
The protocol pre - specified interim analysis was conducted after 552 deaths and showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival ( OS ) in patients treated with abiraterone acetate tablets with prednisone compared to patients in the placebo with prednisone arm ( Table 9 and Figure 1 ) .
An updated survival analysis was conducted when 775 deaths ( 97 % of the planned number of deaths for final analysis ) were observed .
Results from this analysis were consistent with those from the interim analysis ( Table 7 ) .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] COU - AA - 302 : Patients with Metastatic CRPC who had not Received Prior Cytotoxic Chemotherapy : In COU - AA - 302 ( NCT00887198 ) , 1088 patients were randomized 1 : 1 to receive either abiraterone acetate tablets orally at a dose of 1 , 000 mg once daily ( N = 546 ) or Placebo orally once daily ( N = 542 ) .
Both arms were given concomitant prednisone 5 mg twice daily .
Patients continued treatment until radiographic or clinical ( cytotoxic chemotherapy , radiation or surgical treatment for cancer , pain requiring chronic opioids , or ECOG performance status decline to 3 or more ) disease progression , unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal .
Patients with moderate or severe pain , opiate use for cancer pain , or visceral organ metastases were excluded .
Patient demographics were balanced between the treatment arms .
The median age was 70 years .
The racial distribution of patients treated with abiraterone acetate tablets was 95 % Caucasian , 2 . 8 % Black , 0 . 7 % Asian and 1 . 1 % Other .
The ECOG performance status was 0 for 76 % of patients , and 1 for 24 % of patients .
Co - primary efficacy endpoints were overall survival and radiographic progression - free survival ( rPFS ) .
Baseline pain assessment was 0 - 1 ( asymptomatic ) in 66 % of patients and 2 - 3 ( mildly symptomatic ) in 26 % of patients as defined by the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form ( worst pain over the last 24 hours ) .
Radiographic progression - free survival was assessed with the use of sequential imaging studies and was defined by bone scan identification of 2 or more new bone lesions with confirmation ( Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria ) and / or modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria for progression of soft tissue lesions .
Analysis of rPFS utilized centrally - reviewed radiographic assessment of progression .
The planned final analysis for OS , conducted after 741 deaths ( median follow up of 49 months ) demonstrated a statistically significant OS improvement in patients treated with abiraterone acetate tablets with prednisone compared to those treated with placebo with prednisone ( Table 8 and Figure 2 ) .
Sixty - five percent of patients on the abiraterone acetate tablets arm and 78 % of patients on the placebo arm used subsequent therapies that may prolong OS in metastatic CRPC .
Abiraterone acetate tablets were used as a subsequent therapy in 13 % of patients on the abiraterone acetate tablets arm and 44 % of patients on the placebo arm .

[ 2 ] Hazard Ratio is derived from a stratified proportional hazards model .
Hazard ratio < 1 favors abiraterone acetate tablets with prednisone .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] The primary efficacy analyses are supported by the following prospectively defined endpoints .
The median time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy was 25 . 2 months for patients in the abiraterone acetate tablets arm and 16 . 8 months for patients in the placebo arm ( HR = 0 . 580 ; 95 % CI : [ 0 . 487 , 0 . 691 ] , p < 0 . 0001 ) .
The median time to opiate use for prostate cancer pain was not reached for patients receiving abiraterone acetate tablets and was 23 . 7 months for patients receiving placebo ( HR = 0 . 686 ; 95 % CI : [ 0 . 566 , 0 . 833 ] , p = 0 . 0001 ) .
The time to opiate use result was supported by a delay in patient reported pain progression favoring the abiraterone acetate tablets arm .
LATITUDE : Patients with Metastatic High - Risk CSPC : In LATITUDE ( NCT01715285 ) , 1199 patients with metastatic high - risk CSPC were randomized 1 : 1 to receive either abiraterone acetate tablets orally at a dose of 1 , 000 mg once daily with prednisone 5 mg once daily ( N = 597 ) or placebos orally once daily ( N = 602 ) .
High - risk disease was defined as having at least two of three risk factors at baseline : a total Gleason score of ≥ 8 , presence of ≥ 3 lesions on bone scan , and evidence of measurable visceral metastases .
Patients with significant cardiac , adrenal , or hepatic dysfunction were excluded .
Patients continued treatment until radiographic or clinical disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal or death .
Clinical progression was defined as the need for cytotoxic chemotherapy , radiation or surgical treatment for cancer , pain requiring chronic opioids , or ECOG performance status decline to ≥ 3 .
Patient demographics were balanced between the treatment arms .
The median age was 67 years among all randomized subjects .
The racial distribution of patients treated with abiraterone acetate tablets was 69 % Caucasian , 2 . 5 % Black , 21 % Asian , and 8 . 1 % Other .
The ECOG performance status was 0 for 55 % , 1 for 42 % , and 2 for 3 . 5 % of patients .
Baseline pain assessment was 0 - 1 ( asymptomatic ) in 50 % of patients , 2 - 3 ( mildly symptomatic ) in 23 % of patients , and ≥ 4 in 28 % of patients as defined by the Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form ( worst pain over the last 24 hours ) .
A major efficacy outcome was overall survival .
The pre - specified interim analysis after 406 deaths showed a statistically significant improvement in OS in patients on abiraterone acetate tablets with prednisone compared to those on placebos .
Twenty - one percent of patients on the abiraterone acetate tablets arm and 41 % of patients on the placebos arm received subsequent therapies that may prolong OS in metastatic CRPC .
An updated survival analysis was conducted when 618 deaths were observed .
The median follow - up time was 52 months .
Results from this analysis were consistent with those from the pre - specified interim analysis ( Table 10 and Figure 4 ) .
At the updated analysis , 29 % of patients on the abiraterone acetate tablets arm and 45 % of patients on the placebos arm received subsequent therapies that may prolong OS in metastatic CRPC .
