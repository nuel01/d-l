[ MULTIMEDIA ] Rx only [ MULTIMEDIA ] DESCRIPTION : 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP solution is sterile and nonpyrogenic .
It is a parenteral solution containing dextrose in water for injection intended for intravenous administration .
Each 100 mL of 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP , contains dextrose monohydrate , 5 g in water for injection .
The caloric value is 170 kcal / L .
The osmolarity is 252 mOsmol / L ( calc . )
, which is slightly hypotonic .
The solution pH is 4 . 3 ( 3 . 2 to 6 . 5 ) .
This solution contains no bacteriostat , antimicrobial agent or added buffer and is intended only as a single - dose injection .
When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded .
5 % Dextrose Injection , USP is a parenteral fluid and nutrient replenisher .
Dextrose , USP is chemically designated D - glucose monohydrate ( C 6 H 12 O 6 • H 2 O ) , a hexose sugar freely soluble in water .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Water for Injection , USP is chemically designated H 2 O .
The flexible container is fabricated from a specially formulated non - plasticized film containing polypropylene and thermoplastic elastomers ( freeflex ® bag ) .
The freeflex ® + bag has a needle - free injection port and can accept standard luer lock syringes to add medication .
The amount of water that can permeate from the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions in contact with the flexible container can leach out certain of the container ' s chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period .
The suitability of the container material has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : When administered intravenously , these solutions provide a source of water and carbohydrate .
Isotonic and hypertonic concentrations of dextrose are suitable for parenteral maintenance of water requirements when salt is not needed or should be avoided .
Solutions containing carbohydrate in the form of dextrose restore blood glucose levels and provide calories .
Carbohydrate in the form of dextrose may aid in minimizing liver glycogen depletion and exerts a protein - sparing action .
Dextrose injected parenterally undergoes oxidation to carbon dioxide and water .
Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70 % of total body weight .
Average normal adult daily requirements range from two to three liters ( 1 to 1 . 5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production ) .
Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms .
Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium ( Na + ) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE : Intravenous solutions containing dextrose are indicated for parenteral replenishment of fluid and minimal carbohydrate calories as required by the clinical condition of the patient .
CONTRAINDICATIONS : 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP without electrolytes should not be administered simultaneously with blood through the same infusion set because of the possibility that pseudoagglutination of red cells may occur .
WARNINGS : Excessive administration of potassium - free solutions may result in significant hypokalemia .
The intravenous administration of these solutions can cause fluid and / or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of administered parenteral solutions .
The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of such solutions .
PRECAUTIONS : Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance , electrolyte concentrations and acid - base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation .
Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus .
Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged .
Discard unused portion .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Studies with 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , mutagenic potential or effects on fertility .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with dextrose .
It is also not known whether dextrose can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Dextrose should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers Caution should be exercised when 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP is administered to a nursing mother .
Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population are based on the similarity of the clinical conditions of the pediatric and adult populations .
In neonates or very small infants the volume of fluid may affect fluid and electrolyte balance .
Frequent monitoring of serum glucose concentrations is required when dextrose is prescribed to pediatric patients , particularly neonates and low birth weight infants .
In very low birth weight infants , excessive or rapid administration of dextrose injection may result in increased serum osmolarity and possible intracerebral hemorrhage .
Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
ADVERSE REACTIONS : Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response , infection at the site of injection , venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection , extravasation and hypervolemia .
If an adverse reaction does occur , discontinue the infusion , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
OVERDOSAGE : In the event of overhydration or solute overload , re - evaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective measures ( see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : The dose is dependent upon the age , weight and clinical condition of the patient .
As reported in the literature , the dosage and constant infusion rate of intravenous dextrose must be selected with caution in pediatric patients , particularly neonates and low birth weight infants , because of the increased risk of hyperglycemia / hypoglycemia .
Drug Interactions Additives may be incompatible .
Consult with pharmacist , if available .
When introducing additives , use aseptic technique , mix thoroughly and do not store .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
