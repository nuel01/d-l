WARNING XELODA Warfarin Interaction : Patients receiving concomitant capecitabine and oral coumarin - derivative anticoagulant therapy should have their anticoagulant response ( INR or prothrombin time ) monitored frequently in order to adjust the anticoagulant dose accordingly .
A clinically important XELODA - Warfarin drug interaction was demonstrated in a clinical pharmacology trial ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and PRECAUTIONS ) .
Altered coagulation parameters and / or bleeding , including death , have been reported in patients taking XELODA concomitantly with coumarin - derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin and phenprocoumon .
Postmarketing reports have shown clinically significant increases in prothrombin time ( PT ) and INR in patients who were stabilized on anticoagulants at the time XELODA was introduced .
These events occurred within several days and up to several months after initiating XELODA therapy and , in a few cases , within 1 month after stopping XELODA .
These events occurred in patients with and without liver metastases .
Age greater than 60 and a diagnosis of cancer independently predispose patients to an increased risk of coagulopathy .
DESCRIPTION XELODA ( capecitabine ) is a fluoropyrimidine carbamate with antineoplastic activity .
It is an orally administered systemic prodrug of 5 ' - deoxy - 5 - fluorouridine ( 5 ' - DFUR ) which is converted to 5 - fluorouracil .
The chemical name for capecitabine is 5 ' - deoxy - 5 - fluoro - N - [ ( pentyloxy ) carbonyl ] - cytidine and has a molecular weight of 359 . 35 .
Capecitabine has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Capecitabine is a white to off - white crystalline powder with an aqueous solubility of 26 mg / mL at 20 ° C . XELODA is supplied as biconvex , oblong film - coated tablets for oral administration .
Each light peach - colored tablet contains 150 mg capecitabine and each peach - colored tablet contains 500 mg capecitabine .
The inactive ingredients in XELODA include : anhydrous lactose , croscarmellose sodium , hydroxypropyl methylcellulose , microcrystalline cellulose , magnesium stearate and purified water .
The peach or light peach film coating contains hydroxypropyl methylcellulose , talc , titanium dioxide , and synthetic yellow and red iron oxides .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY XELODA is relatively non - cytotoxic in vitro .
This drug is enzymatically converted to 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) in vivo .
Bioactivation Capecitabine is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract .
In the liver , a 60 kDa carboxylesterase hydrolyzes much of the compound to 5 ' - deoxy - 5 - fluorocytidine ( 5 ' - DFCR ) .
Cytidine deaminase , an enzyme found in most tissues , including tumors , subsequently converts 5 ' - DFCR to 5 ' - deoxy - 5 - fluorouridine ( 5 ' - DFUR ) .
The enzyme , thymidine phosphorylase ( dThdPase ) , then hydrolyzes 5 ' - DFUR to the active drug 5 - FU .
Many tissues throughout the body express thymidine phosphorylase .
Some human carcinomas express this enzyme in higher concentrations than surrounding normal tissues .
Metabolic Pathway of capecitabine to 5 - FU [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Mechanism of Action Both normal and tumor cells metabolize 5 - FU to 5 - fluoro - 2 ' - deoxyuridine monophosphate ( FdUMP ) and 5 - fluorouridine triphosphate ( FUTP ) .
These metabolites cause cell injury by two different mechanisms .
First , FdUMP and the folate cofactor , N5 - 10 - methylenetetrahydrofolate , bind to thymidylate synthase ( TS ) to form a covalently bound ternary complex .
This binding inhibits the formation of thymidylate from 2 ' - deoxyuridylate .
Thymidylate is the necessary precursor of thymidine triphosphate , which is essential for the synthesis of DNA , so that a deficiency of this compound can inhibit cell division .
Second , nuclear transcriptional enzymes can mistakenly incorporate FUTP in place of uridine triphosphate ( UTP ) during the synthesis of RNA .
This metabolic error can interfere with RNA processing and protein synthesis .
Pharmacokinetics in Colorectal Tumors and Adjacent Healthy Tissue Following oral administration of XELODA 7 days before surgery in patients with colorectal cancer , the median ratio of 5 - FU concentration in colorectal tumors to adjacent tissues was 2 . 9 ( range from 0 . 9 to 8 . 0 ) .
These ratios have not been evaluated in breast cancer patients or compared to 5 - FU infusion .
Human Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of XELODA and its metabolites have been evaluated in about 200 cancer patients over a dosage range of 500 to 3500 mg / m2 / day .
Over this range , the pharmacokinetics of XELODA and its metabolite , 5 ' - DFCR were dose proportional and did not change over time .
The increases in the AUCs of 5 ' - DFUR and 5 - FU , however , were greater than proportional to the increase in dose and the AUC of 5 - FU was 34 % higher on day 14 than on day 1 .
The elimination half - life of both parent capecitabine and 5 - FU was about ¾ of an hour .
The inter - patient variability in the Cmax and AUC of 5 - FU was greater than 85 % .
Following oral administration of 825 mg / m2 capecitabine twice daily for 14 days , Japanese patients ( n = 18 ) had about 36 % lower Cmax and 24 % lower AUC for capecitabine than the Caucasian patients ( n = 22 ) .
Japanese patients had also about 25 % lower Cmax and 34 % lower AUC for FBAL than the Caucasian patients .
The clinical significance of these differences is unknown .
No significant differences occurred in the exposure to other metabolites ( 5 ' - DFCR , 5 ' - DFUR , and 5 - FU ) .
Absorption , Distribution , Metabolism and Excretion Capecitabine reached peak blood levels in about 1 . 5 hours ( Tmax ) with peak 5 - FU levels occurring slightly later , at 2 hours .
Food reduced both the rate and extent of absorption of capecitabine with mean Cmax and AUC0 - ∞ decreased by 60 % and 35 % , respectively .
The Cmax and AUC0 - ∞ of 5 - FU were also reduced by food by 43 % and 21 % , respectively .
Food delayed Tmax of both parent and 5 - FU by 1 . 5 hours ( see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Plasma protein binding of capecitabine and its metabolites is less than 60 % and is not concentration - dependent .
Capecitabine was primarily bound to human albumin ( approximately 35 % ) .
Capecitabine is extensively metabolized enzymatically to 5 - FU .
The enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase hydrogenates 5 - FU , the product of capecitabine metabolism , to the much less toxic 5 - fluoro - 5 , 6 - dihydro - fluorouracil ( FUH2 ) .
Dihydropyrimidinase cleaves the pyrimidine ring to yield 5 - fluoro - ureido - propionic acid ( FUPA ) .
Finally , β - ureido - propionase cleaves FUPA to α - fluoro - β - alanine ( FBAL ) which is cleared in the urine .
Capecitabine and its metabolites are predominantly excreted in urine ; 95 . 5 % of administered capecitabine dose is recovered in urine .
Fecal excretion is minimal ( 2 . 6 % ) .
The major metabolite excreted in urine is FBAL which represents 57 % of the administered dose .
About 3 % of the administered dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug .
A clinical phase 1 study evaluating the effect of XELODA on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel ( Taxotere ® ) and the effect of docetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of XELODA was conducted in 26 patients with solid tumors .
XELODA was found to have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel ( Cmax and AUC ) and docetaxel has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and the 5 - FU precursor 5 ' - DFUR .
Special Populations A population analysis of pooled data from the two large controlled studies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer ( n = 505 ) who were administered XELODA at 1250 mg / m2 twice a day indicated that gender ( 202 females and 303 males ) and race ( 455 white / Caucasian patients , 22 black patients , and 28 patients of other race ) have no influence on the pharmacokinetics of 5 ' - DFUR , 5 - FU and FBAL .
Age has no significant influence on the pharmacokinetics of 5 ' - DFUR and 5 - FU over the range of 27 to 86 years .
A 20 % increase in age results in a 15 % increase in AUC of FBAL ( see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Hepatic Insufficiency XELODA has been evaluated in 13 patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction due to liver metastases defined by a composite score including bilirubin , AST / ALT and alkaline phosphatase following a single 1255 mg / m2 dose of XELODA .
Both AUC0 - ∞ and Cmax of capecitabine increased by 60 % in patients with hepatic dysfunction compared to patients with normal hepatic function ( n = 14 ) .
The AUC0 - ∞ and Cmax of 5 - FU were not affected .
In patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction due to liver metastases , caution should be exercised when XELODA is administered .
The effect of severe hepatic dysfunction on XELODA is not known ( see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Renal Insufficiency Following oral administration of 1250 mg / m2 capecitabine twice a day to cancer patients with varying degrees of renal impairment , patients with moderate ( creatinine clearance = 30 to 50 mL / min ) and severe ( creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min ) renal impairment showed 85 % and 258 % higher systemic exposure to FBAL on day 1 compared to normal renal function patients ( creatinine clearance > 80 mL / min ) .
Systemic exposure to 5 ' - DFUR was 42 % and 71 % greater in moderately and severely renal impaired patients , respectively , than in normal patients .
Systemic exposure to capecitabine was about 25 % greater in both moderately and severely renal impaired patients ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Drug - Drug Interactions Anticoagulants In four patients with cancer , chronic administration of capecitabine ( 1250 mg / m2 bid ) with a single 20 mg dose of warfarin increased the mean AUC of S - warfarin by 57 % and decreased its clearance by 37 % .
Baseline corrected AUC of INR in these 4 patients increased by 2 . 8 - fold , and the maximum observed mean INR value was increased by 91 % ( see Boxed WARNING and PRECAUTIONS : Drug - Drug Interactions ) .
Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes In vitro enzymatic studies with human liver microsomes indicated that capecitabine and its metabolites ( 5 ' - DFUR , 5 ' - DFCR , 5 - FU , and FBAL ) had no inhibitory effects on substrates of cytochrome P450 for the major isoenzymes such as 1A2 , 2A6 , 3A4 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , and 2E1 .
Antacid When Maalox ® ( 20 mL ) , an aluminum hydroxide - and magnesium hydroxide - containing antacid , was administered immediately after XELODA ( 1250 mg / m2 , n = 12 cancer patients ) , AUC and Cmax increased by 16 % and 35 % , respectively , for capecitabine and by 18 % and 22 % , respectively , for 5 ' - DFCR .
No effect was observed on the other three major metabolites ( 5 ' - DFUR , 5 - FU , FBAL ) of XELODA .
XELODA has a low potential for pharmacokinetic interactions related to plasma protein binding .
CLINICAL STUDIES General The recommended dose of XELODA was determined in an open - label , randomized clinical study , exploring the efficacy and safety of continuous therapy with capecitabine ( 1331 mg / m2 / day in two divided doses , n = 39 ) , intermittent therapy with capecitabine ( 2510 mg / m2 / day in two divided doses , n = 34 ) , and intermittent therapy with capecitabine in combination with oral leucovorin ( LV ) ( capecitabine 1657 mg / m2 / day in two divided doses , n = 35 ; leucovorin 60 mg / day ) in patients with advanced and / or metastatic colorectal carcinoma in the first - line metastatic setting .
There was no apparent advantage in response rate to adding leucovorin to XELODA ; however , toxicity was increased .
XELODA , 1250 mg / m2 twice daily for 14 days followed by a 1 - week rest , was selected for further clinical development based on the overall safety and efficacy profile of the three schedules studied .
Adjuvant Colon Cancer A multicenter randomized , controlled phase 3 clinical trial in patients with Dukes ' C colon cancer provided data concerning the use of XELODA for the adjuvant treatment of patients with colon cancer .
The primary objective of the study was to compare disease - free survival ( DFS ) in patients receiving XELODA to those receiving IV 5 - FU / LV alone .
In this trial , 1987 patients were randomized either to treatment with XELODA 1250 mg / m2 orally twice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1 - week rest period , given as 3 - week cycles for a total of 8 cycles ( 24 weeks ) or IV bolus 5 - FU 425 mg / m2 and 20 mg / m2 IV leucovorin on days 1 to 5 , given as 4 - week cycles for a total of 6 cycles ( 24 weeks ) .
Patients in the study were required to be between 18 and 75 years of age with histologically - confirmed Dukes ' stage C colon cancer with at least one positive lymph node and to have undergone ( within 8 weeks prior to randomization ) complete resection of the primary tumor without macroscopic or microscopic evidence of remaining tumor .
Patients were also required to have no prior cytotoxic chemotherapy or immunotherapy ( except steroids ) , and have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 ( KPS ≥ 70 % ) , ANC ≥ 1 . 5 × 109 / L , platelets ≥ 100 × 109 / L , serum creatinine ≤ 1 . 5 ULN , total bilirubin ≤ 1 . 5 ULN , AST / ALT ≤ 2 . 5 ULN and CEA within normal limits at time of randomization .
The baseline demographics for XELODA and 5 - FU / LV patients are shown in Table 1 .
The baseline characteristics were well - balanced between arms .

The starting dose was reduced in patients with moderate renal impairment ( calculated creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL / min ) at baseline ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Subsequently , for all patients , doses were adjusted when needed according to toxicity .
Dose management for XELODA included dose reductions , cycle delays and treatment interruptions ( see Table 2 ) .
Table 2 Summary of Dose Modifications in X - ACT Study XELODA N = 995 5 - FU / LV N = 974 Median relative dose intensity ( % ) 93 92 Patients completing full course of treatment ( % ) 83 87 Patients with treatment interruption ( % ) 15 5 Patients with cycle delay ( % ) 46 29 Patients with dose reduction ( % ) 42 44 Patients with treatment interruption , cycle delay , or dose reduction ( % ) 57 52 The median follow - up at the time of the analysis was 53 months .
The hazard ratio for DFS for XELODA compared to 5 - FU / LV was 0 . 87 ( 95 % C . I . 0 . 76 – 1 . 00 ) .
Because the upper 2 - sided 95 % confidence limit of hazard ratio was less than 1 . 20 , XELODA was non - inferior to 5 - FU / LV .
The choice of the non - inferiority margin of 1 . 20 corresponds to the retention of approximately 75 % of the 5 - FU / LV effect on DFS .
Survival data were not mature at the time of the analysis with a median follow - up of 53 months .
The comparison of overall survival did not reach statistical significance for the test of difference ( HR 0 . 88 , 95 % C . I . 0 . 74 – 1 . 05 ; p = 0 . 169 ) .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Data from two open - label , multicenter , randomized , controlled clinical trials involving 1207 patients support the use of XELODA in the first - line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma .
The two clinical studies were identical in design and were conducted in 120 centers in different countries .
Study 1 was conducted in the US , Canada , Mexico , and Brazil ; Study 2 was conducted in Europe , Israel , Australia , New Zealand , and Taiwan .
Altogether , in both trials , 603 patients were randomized to treatment with XELODA at a dose of 1250 mg / m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1 - week rest period and given as 3 - week cycles ; 604 patients were randomized to treatment with 5 - FU and leucovorin ( 20 mg / m2 leucovorin IV followed by 425 mg / m2 IV bolus 5 - FU , on days 1 to 5 , every 28 days ) .
In both trials , overall survival , time to progression and response rate ( complete plus partial responses ) were assessed .
Responses were defined by the World Health Organization criteria and submitted to a blinded independent review committee ( IRC ) .
Differences in assessments between the investigator and IRC were reconciled by the sponsor , blinded to treatment arm , according to a specified algorithm .
Survival was assessed based on a non - inferiority analysis .
The baseline demographics for XELODA and 5 - FU / LV patients are shown in Table 4 .

The similarity of XELODA and 5 - FU / LV in these studies was assessed by examining the potential difference between the two treatments .
In order to assure that XELODA has a clinically meaningful survival effect , statistical analyses were performed to determine the percent of the survival effect of 5 - FU / LV that was retained by XELODA .
The estimate of the survival effect of 5 - FU / LV was derived from a meta - analysis of ten randomized studies from the published literature comparing 5 - FU to regimens of 5 - FU / LV that were similar to the control arms used in these Studies 1 and 2 .
The method for comparing the treatments was to examine the worst case ( 95 % confidence upper bound ) for the difference between 5 - FU / LV and XELODA , and to show that loss of more than 50 % of the 5 - FU / LV survival effect was ruled out .
It was demonstrated that the percent of the survival effect of 5 - FU / LV maintained was at least 61 % for Study 2 and 10 % for Study 1 .
The pooled result is consistent with a retention of at least 50 % of the effect of 5 - FU / LV .
It should be noted that these values for preserved effect are based on the upper bound of the 5 - FU / LV vs XELODA difference .
These results do not exclude the possibility of true equivalence of XELODA to 5 - FU / LV ( see Table 5 , Table 6 , and Figure 2 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Breast Cancer XELODA has been evaluated in clinical trials in combination with docetaxel ( Taxotere ® ) and as monotherapy .
Breast Cancer Combination Therapy The dose of XELODA used in the phase 3 clinical trial in combination with docetaxel was based on the results of a phase 1 study , where a range of doses of docetaxel administered in 3 - week cycles in combination with an intermittent regimen of XELODA ( 14 days of treatment , followed by a 7 - day rest period ) were evaluated .
The combination dose regimen was selected based on the tolerability profile of the 75 mg / m2 administered in 3 - week cycles of docetaxel in combination with 1250 mg / m2 twice daily for 14 days of XELODA administered in 3 - week cycles .
The approved dose of 100 mg / m2 of docetaxel administered in 3 - week cycles was the control arm of the phase 3 study .
XELODA in combination with docetaxel was assessed in an open - label , multicenter , randomized trial in 75 centers in Europe , North America , South America , Asia , and Australia .
A total of 511 patients with metastatic breast cancer resistant to , or recurring during or after an anthracycline - containing therapy , or relapsing during or recurring within 2 years of completing an anthracycline - containing adjuvant therapy were enrolled .
Two hundred and fifty - five ( 255 ) patients were randomized to receive XELODA 1250 mg / m2 twice daily for 14 days followed by 1 week without treatment and docetaxel 75 mg / m2 as a 1 - hour intravenous infusion administered in 3 - week cycles .
In the monotherapy arm , 256 patients received docetaxel 100 mg / m2 as a 1 - hour intravenous infusion administered in 3 - week cycles .

The objective response rate in this population was supported by a response rate of 18 . 5 % ( 1 CR , 24 PRs ) in the overall population of 135 patients with measurable disease , who were less resistant to chemotherapy ( see Table 9 ) .
The median time to progression was 90 days and the median survival was 306 days .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Colorectal Cancer • XELODA is indicated as a single agent for adjuvant treatment in patients with Dukes ' C colon cancer who have undergone complete resection of the primary tumor when treatment with fluoropyrimidine therapy alone is preferred .
XELODA was non - inferior to 5 - fluorouracil and leucovorin ( 5 - FU / LV ) for disease - free survival ( DFS ) .
Although neither XELODA nor combination chemotherapy prolongs overall survival ( OS ) , combination chemotherapy has been demonstrated to improve disease - free survival compared to 5 - FU / LV .
Physicians should consider these results when prescribing single - agent XELODA in the adjuvant treatment of Dukes ' C colon cancer .
• XELODA is indicated as first - line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma when treatment with fluoropyrimidine therapy alone is preferred .
Combination chemotherapy has shown a survival benefit compared to 5 - FU / LV alone .
A survival benefit over 5 - FU / LV has not been demonstrated with XELODA monotherapy .
Use of XELODA instead of 5 - FU / LV in combinations has not been adequately studied to assure safety or preservation of the survival advantage .
Breast Cancer • XELODA in combination with docetaxel is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior anthracycline - containing chemotherapy .
• XELODA monotherapy is also indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer resistant to both paclitaxel and an anthracycline - containing chemotherapy regimen or resistant to paclitaxel and for whom further anthracycline therapy is not indicated , eg , patients who have received cumulative doses of 400 mg / m2 of doxorubicin or doxorubicin equivalents .
Resistance is defined as progressive disease while on treatment , with or without an initial response , or relapse within 6 months of completing treatment with an anthracycline - containing adjuvant regimen .
CONTRAINDICATIONS XELODA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to capecitabine or to any of its components .
XELODA is contraindicated in patients who have a known hypersensitivity to 5 - fluorouracil .
XELODA is contraindicated in patients with known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) deficiency .
XELODA is also contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance below 30 mL / min [ Cockroft and Gault ] ) ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations ) .
WARNINGS Renal Insufficiency Patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline require dose reduction ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Patients with mild and moderate renal impairment at baseline should be carefully monitored for adverse events .
Prompt interruption of therapy with subsequent dose adjustments is recommended if a patient develops a grade 2 to 4 adverse event as outlined in Table 18 in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .
Coagulopathy See Boxed WARNING .
Diarrhea XELODA can induce diarrhea , sometimes severe .
Patients with severe diarrhea should be carefully monitored and given fluid and electrolyte replacement if they become dehydrated .
In 875 patients with either metastatic breast or colorectal cancer who received XELODA monotherapy , the median time to first occurrence of grade 2 to 4 diarrhea was 34 days ( range from 1 to 369 days ) .
The median duration of grade 3 to 4 diarrhea was 5 days .
National Cancer Institute of Canada ( NCIC ) grade 2 diarrhea is defined as an increase of 4 to 6 stools / day or nocturnal stools , grade 3 diarrhea as an increase of 7 to 9 stools / day or incontinence and malabsorption , and grade 4 diarrhea as an increase of ≥ 10 stools / day or grossly bloody diarrhea or the need for parenteral support .
If grade 2 , 3 or 4 diarrhea occurs , administration of XELODA should be immediately interrupted until the diarrhea resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1 .
Following a reoccurrence of grade 2 diarrhea or occurrence of any grade 3 or 4 diarrhea , subsequent doses of XELODA should be decreased ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Standard antidiarrheal treatments ( eg , loperamide ) are recommended .
Necrotizing enterocolitis ( typhlitis ) has been reported .
Geriatric Patients Patients ≥ 80 years old may experience a greater incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events ( see PRECAUTIONS : Geriatric Use ) .
In 875 patients with either metastatic breast or colorectal cancer who received XELODA monotherapy , 62 % of the 21 patients ≥ 80 years of age treated with XELODA experienced a treatment - related grade 3 or 4 adverse event : diarrhea in 6 ( 28 . 6 % ) , nausea in 3 ( 14 . 3 % ) , hand - and - foot syndrome in 3 ( 14 . 3 % ) , and vomiting in 2 ( 9 . 5 % ) patients .
Among the 10 patients 70 years of age and greater ( no patients were > 80 years of age ) treated with XELODA in combination with docetaxel , 30 % ( 3 out of 10 ) of patients experienced grade 3 or 4 diarrhea and stomatitis , and 40 % ( 4 out of 10 ) experienced grade 3 hand - and - foot syndrome .
Among the 67 patients ≥ 60 years of age receiving XELODA in combination with docetaxel , the incidence of grade 3 or 4 treatment - related adverse events , treatment - related serious adverse events , withdrawals due to adverse events , treatment discontinuations due to adverse events and treatment discontinuations within the first two treatment cycles was higher than in the < 60 years of age patient group .
In 995 patients receiving XELODA as adjuvant therapy for Dukes ' C colon cancer after resection of the primary tumor , 41 % of the 398 patients ≥ 65 years of age treated with XELODA experienced a treatment - related grade 3 or 4 adverse event : hand - and - foot syndrome in 75 ( 18 . 8 % ) , diarrhea in 52 ( 13 . 1 % ) , stomatitis in 12 ( 3 . 0 % ) , neutropenia / granulocytopenia in 11 ( 2 . 8 % ) , vomiting in 6 ( 1 . 5 % ) , and nausea in 5 ( 1 . 3 % ) patients .
In patients ≥ 65 years of age ( all randomized population ; capecitabine 188 patients , 5 - FU / LV 208 patients ) treated for Dukes ' C colon cancer after resection of the primary tumor , the hazard ratios for disease - free survival and overall survival for XELODA compared to 5 - FU / LV were 1 . 01 ( 95 % C . I . 0 . 80 – 1 . 27 ) and 1 . 04 ( 95 % C . I . 0 . 79 – 1 . 37 ) , respectively .
Pregnancy XELODA may cause fetal harm when given to a pregnant woman .
Capecitabine at doses of 198 mg / kg / day during organogenesis caused malformations and embryo death in mice .
In separate pharmacokinetic studies , this dose in mice produced 5 ' - DFUR AUC values about 0 . 2 times the corresponding values in patients administered the recommended daily dose .
Malformations in mice included cleft palate , anophthalmia , microphthalmia , oligodactyly , polydactyly , syndactyly , kinky tail and dilation of cerebral ventricles .
At doses of 90 mg / kg / day , capecitabine given to pregnant monkeys during organogenesis caused fetal death .
This dose produced 5 ' - DFUR AUC values about 0 . 6 times the corresponding values in patients administered the recommended daily dose .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women using XELODA .
If the drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus .
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with XELODA .
PRECAUTIONS General Patients receiving therapy with XELODA should be monitored by a physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents .
Most adverse events are reversible and do not need to result in discontinuation , although doses may need to be withheld or reduced ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Combination With Other Drugs Use of XELODA in combination with irinotecan has not been adequately studied .
Hand - and - Foot Syndrome Hand - and - foot syndrome ( palmar - plantar erythrodysesthesia or chemotherapy - induced acral erythema ) is a cutaneous toxicity .
Median time to onset was 79 days ( range from 11 to 360 days ) with a severity range of grades 1 to 3 for patients receiving XELODA monotherapy in the metastatic setting .
Grade 1 is characterized by any of the following : numbness , dysesthesia / paresthesia , tingling , painless swelling or erythema of the hands and / or feet and / or discomfort which does not disrupt normal activities .
Grade 2 hand - and - foot syndrome is defined as painful erythema and swelling of the hands and / or feet and / or discomfort affecting the patient ' s activities of daily living .
Grade 3 hand - and - foot syndrome is defined as moist desquamation , ulceration , blistering or severe pain of the hands and / or feet and / or severe discomfort that causes the patient to be unable to work or perform activities of daily living .
If grade 2 or 3 hand - and - foot syndrome occurs , administration of XELODA should be interrupted until the event resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1 .
Following grade 3 hand - and - foot syndrome , subsequent doses of XELODA should be decreased ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Cardiotoxicity The cardiotoxicity observed with XELODA includes myocardial infarction / ischemia , angina , dysrhythmias , cardiac arrest , cardiac failure , sudden death , electrocardiographic changes , and cardiomyopathy .
These adverse events may be more common in patients with a prior history of coronary artery disease .
Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase Deficiency Rarely , unexpected , severe toxicity ( eg , stomatitis , diarrhea , neutropenia and neurotoxicity ) associated with 5 - fluorouracil has been attributed to a deficiency of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) activity .
A link between decreased levels of DPD and increased , potentially fatal toxic effects of 5 - fluorouracil therefore cannot be excluded .
Hepatic Insufficiency Patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction due to liver metastases should be carefully monitored when XELODA is administered .
The effect of severe hepatic dysfunction on the disposition of XELODA is not known ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Hyperbilirubinemia In 875 patients with either metastatic breast or colorectal cancer who received at least one dose of XELODA 1250 mg / m2 twice daily as monotherapy for 2 weeks followed by a 1 - week rest period , grade 3 ( 1 . 5 - 3 × ULN ) hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 15 . 2 % ( n = 133 ) of patients and grade 4 ( > 3 × ULN ) hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 3 . 9 % ( n = 34 ) of patients .
Of 566 patients who had hepatic metastases at baseline and 309 patients without hepatic metastases at baseline , grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 22 . 8 % and 12 . 3 % , respectively .
Of the 167 patients with grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia , 18 . 6 % ( n = 31 ) also had postbaseline elevations ( grades 1 to 4 , without elevations at baseline ) in alkaline phosphatase and 27 . 5 % ( n = 46 ) had postbaseline elevations in transaminases at any time ( not necessarily concurrent ) .
The majority of these patients , 64 . 5 % ( n = 20 ) and 71 . 7 % ( n = 33 ) , had liver metastases at baseline .
In addition , 57 . 5 % ( n = 96 ) and 35 . 3 % ( n = 59 ) of the 167 patients had elevations ( grades 1 to 4 ) at both prebaseline and postbaseline in alkaline phosphatase or transaminases , respectively .
Only 7 . 8 % ( n = 13 ) and 3 . 0 % ( n = 5 ) had grade 3 or 4 elevations in alkaline phosphatase or transaminases .
In the 596 patients treated with XELODA as first - line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer , the incidence of grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia was similar to the overall clinical trial safety database of XELODA monotherapy .
The median time to onset for grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia in the colorectal cancer population was 64 days and median total bilirubin increased from 8 µm / L at baseline to 13 µm / L during treatment with XELODA .
Of the 136 colorectal cancer patients with grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia , 49 patients had grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia as their last measured value , of which 46 had liver metastases at baseline .
In 251 patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a combination of XELODA and docetaxel , grade 3 ( 1 . 5 to 3 × ULN ) hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 7 % ( n = 17 ) and grade 4 ( > 3 × ULN ) hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 2 % ( n = 5 ) .
If drug - related grade 2 to 4 elevations in bilirubin occur , administration of XELODA should be immediately interrupted until the hyperbilirubinemia resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1 .
NCIC grade 2 hyperbilirubinemia is defined as 1 . 5 × normal , grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia as 1 . 5 to 3 × normal and grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia as > 3 × normal .
( See recommended dose modifications under DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . )
Hematologic In 875 patients with either metastatic breast or colorectal cancer who received a dose of 1250 mg / m2 administered twice daily as monotherapy for 2 weeks followed by a 1 - week rest period , 3 . 2 % , 1 . 7 % , and 2 . 4 % of patients had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia , thrombocytopenia or decreases in hemoglobin , respectively .
In 251 patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a dose of XELODA in combination with docetaxel , 68 % had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia , 2 . 8 % had grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia , and 9 . 6 % had grade 3 or 4 anemia .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility Adequate studies investigating the carcinogenic potential of XELODA have not been conducted .
Capecitabine was not mutagenic in vitro to bacteria ( Ames test ) or mammalian cells ( Chinese hamster V79 / HPRT gene mutation assay ) .
Capecitabine was clastogenic in vitro to human peripheral blood lymphocytes but not clastogenic in vivo to mouse bone marrow ( micronucleus test ) .
Fluorouracil causes mutations in bacteria and yeast .
Fluorouracil also causes chromosomal abnormalities in the mouse micronucleus test in vivo .
Impairment of Fertility In studies of fertility and general reproductive performance in mice , oral capecitabine doses of 760 mg / kg / day disturbed estrus and consequently caused a decrease in fertility .
In mice that became pregnant , no fetuses survived this dose .
The disturbance in estrus was reversible .
In males , this dose caused degenerative changes in the testes , including decreases in the number of spermatocytes and spermatids .
In separate pharmacokinetic studies , this dose in mice produced 5 ' - DFUR AUC values about 0 . 7 times the corresponding values in patients administered the recommended daily dose .
Information for Patients ( see Patient Package Insert ) Patients and patients ' caregivers should be informed of the expected adverse effects of XELODA , particularly nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and hand - and - foot syndrome , and should be made aware that patient - specific dose adaptations during therapy are expected and necessary ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Patients should be encouraged to recognize the common grade 2 toxicities associated with XELODA treatment .
Diarrhea Patients experiencing grade 2 diarrhea ( an increase of 4 to 6 stools / day or nocturnal stools ) or greater should be instructed to stop taking XELODA immediately .
Standard antidiarrheal treatments ( eg , loperamide ) are recommended .
Nausea Patients experiencing grade 2 nausea ( food intake significantly decreased but able to eat intermittently ) or greater should be instructed to stop taking XELODA immediately .
Initiation of symptomatic treatment is recommended .
Vomiting Patients experiencing grade 2 vomiting ( 2 to 5 episodes in a 24 - hour period ) or greater should be instructed to stop taking XELODA immediately .
Initiation of symptomatic treatment is recommended .
Hand - and - Foot Syndrome Patients experiencing grade 2 hand - and - foot syndrome ( painful erythema and swelling of the hands and / or feet and / or discomfort affecting the patients ' activities of daily living ) or greater should be instructed to stop taking XELODA immediately .
Stomatitis Patients experiencing grade 2 stomatitis ( painful erythema , edema or ulcers of the mouth or tongue , but able to eat ) or greater should be instructed to stop taking XELODA immediately .
Initiation of symptomatic treatment is recommended ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Fever and Neutropenia Patients who develop a fever of 100 . 5 ° F or greater or other evidence of potential infection should be instructed to call their physician .
Drug - Food Interaction In all clinical trials , patients were instructed to administer XELODA within 30 minutes after a meal .
Since current safety and efficacy data are based upon administration with food , it is recommended that XELODA be administered with food ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Drug - Drug Interactions Antacid The effect of an aluminum hydroxide - and magnesium hydroxide - containing antacid ( Maalox ) on the pharmacokinetics of XELODA was investigated in 12 cancer patients .
There was a small increase in plasma concentrations of XELODA and one metabolite ( 5 ' - DFCR ) ; there was no effect on the 3 major metabolites ( 5 ' - DFUR , 5 - FU and FBAL ) .
Anticoagulants Patients receiving concomitant capecitabine and oral coumarin - derivative anticoagulant therapy should have their anticoagulant response ( INR or prothrombin time ) monitored closely with great frequency and the anticoagulant dose should be adjusted accordingly ( see Boxed WARNING and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ) .
Altered coagulation parameters and / or bleeding have been reported in patients taking XELODA concomitantly with coumarin - derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin and phenprocoumon .
These events occurred within several days and up to several months after initiating XELODA therapy and , in a few cases , within 1 month after stopping XELODA .
These events occurred in patients with and without liver metastases .
In a drug interaction study with single - dose warfarin administration , there was a significant increase in the mean AUC of S - warfarin .
The maximum observed INR value increased by 91 % .
This interaction is probably due to an inhibition of cytochrome P450 2C9 by capecitabine and / or its metabolites ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ) .
CYP2C9 substrates Other than warfarin , no formal drug - drug interaction studies between XELODA and other CYP2C9 substrates have been conducted .
Care should be exercised when XELODA is coadministered with CYP2C9 substrates .
Phenytoin The level of phenytoin should be carefully monitored in patients taking XELODA and phenytoin dose may need to be reduced ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : Dose Management Guidelines ) .
Postmarketing reports indicate that some patients receiving XELODA and phenytoin had toxicity associated with elevated phenytoin levels .
Formal drug - drug interaction studies with phenytoin have not been conducted , but the mechanism of interaction is presumed to be inhibition of the CYP2C9 isoenzyme by capecitabine and / or its metabolites ( see PRECAUTIONS : Drug - Drug Interactions : Anticoagulants ) .
Leucovorin The concentration of 5 - fluorouracil is increased and its toxicity may be enhanced by leucovorin .
Deaths from severe enterocolitis , diarrhea , and dehydration have been reported in elderly patients receiving weekly leucovorin and fluorouracil .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Category D ( see WARNINGS ) .
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with XELODA .
Nursing Women Lactating mice given a single oral dose of capecitabine excreted significant amounts of capecitabine metabolites into the milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from capecitabine , it is recommended that nursing be discontinued when receiving XELODA therapy .
Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of XELODA in persons < 18 years of age have not been established .
Geriatric Use Physicians should pay particular attention to monitoring the adverse effects of XELODA in the elderly ( see WARNINGS : Geriatric Patients ) .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Adjuvant Colon Cancer Table 11 shows the adverse events occurring in ≥ 5 % of patients from one phase 3 trial in patients with Dukes ' C colon cancer who received at least one dose of study medication and had at least one safety assessment .
A total of 995 patients were treated with 1250 mg / m2 twice a day of XELODA administered for 2 weeks followed by a 1 - week rest period , and 974 patients were administered 5 - FU and leucovorin ( 20 mg / m2 leucovorin IV followed by 425 mg / m2 IV bolus 5 - FU , on days 1 - 5 , every 28 days ) .
The median duration of treatment was 164 days for capecitabine - treated patients and 145 days for 5 - FU / LV - treated patients .
A total of 112 ( 11 % ) and 73 ( 7 % ) capecitabine and 5 - FU / LV - treated patients , respectively , discontinued treatment because of adverse events .
A total of 18 deaths due to all causes occurred either on study or within 28 days of receiving study drug : 8 ( 0 . 8 % ) patients randomized to XELODA and 10 ( 1 . 0 % ) randomized to 5 - FU / LV .

[ 2 ] It should be noted that grading was according to NCIC CTC Version 1 ( May , 1994 ) .
In the NCIC - CTC Version 1 , hyperbilirubinemia grade 3 indicates a bilirubin value of 1 . 5 to 3 . 0 × upper limit of normal ( ULN ) range , and grade 4 a value of > 3 . 0 × ULN .
The NCI CTC Version 2 and above define a grade 3 bilirubin value of > 3 . 0 to 10 . 0 × ULN , and grade 4 values > 10 . 0 × ULN .
Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Table 13 shows the adverse events occurring in ≥ 5 % of patients from pooling the two phase 3 trials in first line metastatic colorectal cancer .
A total of 596 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer were treated with 1250 mg / m2 twice a day of XELODA administered for 2 weeks followed by a 1 - week rest period , and 593 patients were administered 5 - FU and leucovorin in the Mayo regimen ( 20 mg / m2 leucovorin IV followed by 425 mg / m2 IV bolus 5 - FU , on days 1 - 5 , every 28 days ) .
In the pooled colorectal database the median duration of treatment was 139 days for capecitabine - treated patients and 140 days for 5 - FU / LV - treated patients .
A total of 78 ( 13 % ) and 63 ( 11 % ) capecitabine and 5 - FU / LV - treated patients , respectively , discontinued treatment because of adverse events / intercurrent illness .
A total of 82 deaths due to all causes occurred either on study or within 28 days of receiving study drug : 50 ( 8 . 4 % ) patients randomized to XELODA and 32 ( 5 . 4 % ) randomized to 5 - FU / LV .

In the XELODA and docetaxel combination arm the treatment was XELODA administered orally 1250 mg / m2 twice daily as intermittent therapy ( 2 weeks of treatment followed by 1 week without treatment ) for at least 6 weeks and docetaxel administered as a 1 - hour intravenous infusion at a dose of 75 mg / m2 on the first day of each 3 - week cycle for at least 6 weeks .
In the monotherapy arm docetaxel was administered as a 1 - hour intravenous infusion at a dose of 100 mg / m2 on the first day of each 3 - week cycle for at least 6 weeks .
The mean duration of treatment was 129 days in the combination arm and 98 days in the monotherapy arm .
A total of 66 patients ( 26 % ) in the combination arm and 49 ( 19 % ) in the monotherapy arm withdrew from the study because of adverse events .
The percentage of patients requiring dose reductions due to adverse events was 65 % in the combination arm and 36 % in the monotherapy arm .
The percentage of patients requiring treatment interruptions due to adverse events in the combination arm was 79 % .
Treatment interruptions were part of the dose modification scheme for the combination therapy arm but not for the docetaxel monotherapy - treated patients .

Medical management of overdose should include customary supportive medical interventions aimed at correcting the presenting clinical manifestations .
Although no clinical experience using dialysis as a treatment for XELODA overdose has been reported , dialysis may be of benefit in reducing circulating concentrations of 5 ' - DFUR , a low – molecular - weight metabolite of the parent compound .
Single doses of XELODA were not lethal to mice , rats , and monkeys at doses up to 2000 mg / kg ( 2 . 4 , 4 . 8 , and 9 . 6 times the recommended human daily dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose of XELODA is 1250 mg / m2 administered orally twice daily ( morning and evening ; equivalent to 2500 mg / m2 total daily dose ) for 2 weeks followed by a 1 - week rest period given as 3 - week cycles .
XELODA tablets should be swallowed with water within 30 minutes after a meal .
In combination with docetaxel , the recommended dose of XELODA is 1250 mg / m2 twice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1 - week rest period , combined with docetaxel at 75 mg / m2 as a 1 - hour intravenous infusion every 3 weeks .
Pre - medication , according to the docetaxel labeling , should be started prior to docetaxel administration for patients receiving the XELODA plus docetaxel combination .
Table 17 displays the total daily dose by body surface area and the number of tablets to be taken at each dose .
Adjuvant treatment in patients with Dukes ' C colon cancer is recommended for a total of 6 months , ie , XELODA 1250 mg / m2 orally twice daily for 2 weeks followed by a 1 - week rest period , given as 3 - week cycles for a total of 8 cycles ( 24 weeks ) .

Patients should be carefully monitored for toxicity and doses of XELODA should be modified as necessary to accommodate individual patient tolerance to treatment ( see CLINICAL STUDIES ) .
Toxicity due to XELODA administration may be managed by symptomatic treatment , dose interruptions and adjustment of XELODA dose .
Once the dose has been reduced it should not be increased at a later time .
The dose of phenytoin and the dose of coumarin - derivative anticoagulants may need to be reduced when either drug is administered concomitantly with XELODA ( see PRECAUTIONS : Drug - Drug Interactions ) .
XELODA dose modification scheme as described below ( see Table 18 and Table 19 ) is recommended for the management of adverse events .

Dosage modifications are not recommended for grade 1 events .
Therapy with XELODA should be interrupted upon the occurrence of a grade 2 or 3 adverse experience .
Once the adverse event has resolved or decreased in intensity to grade 1 , then XELODA therapy may be restarted at full dose or as adjusted according to Table 18 and Table 19 .
If a grade 4 experience occurs , therapy should be discontinued or interrupted until resolved or decreased to grade 1 , and therapy should be restarted at 50 % of the original dose .
Doses of XELODA omitted for toxicity are not replaced or restored ; instead the patient should resume the planned treatment cycles .
Adjustment of Starting Dose in Special Populations Hepatic Impairment In patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction due to liver metastases , no starting dose adjustment is necessary ; however , patients should be carefully monitored .
Patients with severe hepatic dysfunction have not been studied .
Renal Impairment No adjustment to the starting dose of XELODA is recommended in patients with mild renal impairment ( creatinine clearance = 51 to 80 mL / min [ Cockroft and Gault , as shown below ] ) .
In patients with moderate renal impairment ( baseline creatinine clearance = 30 to 50 mL / min ) , a dose reduction to 75 % of the XELODA starting dose when used as monotherapy or in combination with docetaxel ( from 1250 mg / m2 to 950 mg / m2 twice daily ) is recommended ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations ) .
Subsequent dose adjustment is recommended as outlined in Table 18 and Table 19 if a patient develops a grade 2 to 4 adverse event ( see WARNINGS ) .
The starting dose adjustment recommendations for patients with moderate renal impairment apply both to XELODA monotherapy and XELODA in combination use with docetaxel .
Cockroft and Gault Equation : ( 140 - age [ yrs ] ) ( body wt [ kg ] ) Creatinine clearance for males = ————————————— ( 72 ) ( serum creatinine [ mg / dL ] ) Creatinine clearance for females = 0 . 85 × male value Geriatrics Physicians should exercise caution in monitoring the effects of XELODA in the elderly .

This leaflet contains important information about XELODA .
However , this information does not take the place of talking with your doctor .
This information cannot cover all possible risks and benefits of XELODA .
Your doctor should always be your first choice for discussing your medical condition and this medicine .
What is XELODA ?
XELODA is a medicine you take by mouth ( orally ) .
XELODA is changed in the body to 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - FU ) .
In some patients with colon , rectum or breast cancer , 5 - FU stops cancer cells from growing and decreases the size of the tumor .
XELODA is used to treat : • – cancer of the colon after surgery • – cancer of the colon or rectum ( colorectal cancer ) that has spread to other parts of the body ( metastatic colorectal cancer ) .
You should know that in studies , other medicines showed improved survival when they were taken together with 5 - FU and leucovorin .
In studies , XELODA was no worse than 5 - FU and leucovorin taken together but did not improve survival compared to these two medicines .
• – breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body ( metastatic breast cancer ) together with another medicine called docetaxel ( Taxotere ® ) • – breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and has not improved after treatment with other medicines such as paclitaxel ( Taxol ® ) and anthracycline - containing medicine such as Adriamycin ™ and doxorubicin What is the most important information about XELODA ?
XELODA may increase the effect of other medicines used to thin your blood such as warfarin ( Coumadin ® ) .
It is very important that your doctor knows if you are taking a blood thinner such as warfarin because XELODA may increase the effect of this medicine and could lead to serious side effects .
If you are taking blood thinners and XELODA , your doctor needs to check more often how fast your blood clots and change the dose of the blood thinner , if needed .

TELL YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU • – take a blood thinner such as warfarin ( Coumadin ) .
This is very important because XELODA may increase the effect of the blood thinner .
If you are taking blood thinners and XELODA , your doctor needs to check more often how fast your blood clots and change the dose of the blood thinner , if needed .
• – take phenytoin ( Dilantin ® ) .
Your doctor needs to test the levels of phenytoin in your blood more often or change your dose of phenytoin .
• – are pregnant or think you may be pregnant .
XELODA may harm your unborn child .
