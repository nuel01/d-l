IMPORTANT DRUG INFORMATION may be found at the following link : https : / / imaging . bracco . com / us - en / products / ct - ct - colonography / iomeron July 6 , 2022 Subject : Temporary importation of Iomeron ® ( iomeprol injection ) to address drug shortage issues Dear Healthcare Professional , Due to the current critical shortages of Omnipaque ™ ( iohexol injection ) , Visipaque ™ ( iodixanol injection ) , and Ultravist ( iopromide injection ) in the U . S . market , Bracco Diagnostics Inc . ( hereafter “ Bracco ” ) is coordinating with the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to increase the availability of iodinated contrast media indicated for intravascular use .
Accordingly , Bracco has initiated temporary importation of Iomeron ® ( iomeprol injection ) , an intravascular iodinated contrast medium , into the U . S . market .
This product will be used in adult patients by intravenous or intraarterial route of administration only during the shortage .
FDA has not approved Iomeron ( iomeprol ) .
Iomeron ( iomeprol ) drug product is manufactured by BIPSO GmbH in Germany and Patheon Italia S . p . A . in Italy .
These facilities are also used to manufacture Bracco ’ s FDA - approved intravascular iodinated contrast medium Isovue ( iopamidol injection ) .
FDA ’ s regulatory discretion for the importation and distribution of Iomeron ( iomeprol ) is limited to Bracco during the critical U . S . shortages of Omnipaque , Visipaque , and Ultravist .
Effective immediately , and during this temporary period , Bracco will offer the following presentations of Iomeron ( iomeprol ) to the U . S . market : Product Description Iodine Concentration ( mg iodine / mL ) Package Size Lot Number Label Language NDC Number UK SmPC Iomeron ( iomeprol injection ) 250 250 56 X 100 mL 2C42685 French 0270 - 7250 - 10 Iomeron 300 UK SmPC SD Iomeron ( iomeprol injection ) 300 300 56 X 100 mL 2C43416 KP1552A French 0270 - 7300 - 10 Iomeron 300 UK SmPC SD Iomeron ( iomeprol injection ) 300 300 10 X 200 mL KP2701F English 0270 - 7300 - 20 Iomeron 300 UK SmPC SD Iomeron ( iomeprol injection ) 300 300 6 X 500 mL KP2804A Spanish 0270 - 9300 - 06 Iomeron 300 UK SmPC MD Iomeron ( iomeprol injection ) 350 350 56 X 100 mL LP1566C Russian 0270 - 7350 - 10 Iomeron 350 UK SmPC SD Iomeron ( iomeprol injection ) 350 350 30 X 150 mL 2C42507 French 0270 - 7350 - 15 Iomeron 350 UK SmPC SD Iomeron ( iomeprol injection ) 350 350 10 X 200 mL LP2705A English 0270 - 7350 - 20 Iomeron 350 UK SmPC SD Iomeron ( iomeprol injection ) 350 350 6 X 500 mL LP2807A Spanish 0270 - 9350 - 06 Iomeron 350 UK SmPC MD Iomeron ( iomeprol injection ) 350 350 9 X 500 mL LP2810B English 0270 - 9350 - 09 Iomeron 350 UK SmPC MD Iomeron ( iomeprol injection ) 400 400 56 X 100 mL MP1577A Russian 0270 - 7400 - 13 Iomeron 400 UK SmPC SD Iomeron ( iomeprol injection ) 400 400 10 X 100 mL MP2561C Portuguese 0270 - 7400 - 10 Iomeron 400 UK SmPC SD Iomeron ( iomeprol injection ) 400 400 56 X 100 mL MP2556A Polish 0270 - 7400 - 16 Iomeron 400 UK SmPC SD Iomeron ( iomeprol injection ) 400 400 30 X 200 mL MP2702C Slovenian 0270 - 7400 - 20 Iomeron 400 UK SmPC SD Iomeron ( iomeprol injection ) 400 400 9 X 500 mL MP2807C English 0270 - 9400 - 01 Iomeron 400 UK SmPC MD Iomeron ( iomeprol injection ) 400 400 6 X 500 mL MP2806A English 0270 - 9400 - 06 Iomeron 400 UK SmPC MD Iomeron ( iomeprol injection ) 400 400 9 X 500 mL MP2807A Portuguese 0270 - 9400 - 03 Iomeron 400 UK SmPC MD The imported Iomeron ( iomeprol ) was originally labelled for use in countries outside the United States .
The bottle and box labels will display the text used when marketing Iomeron ( iomeprol ) in those countries .
Note that : • The prescribing information will be provided with each bottle of Iomeron ( iomeprol ) , in the form of the appropriate Summary of Product Characteristics ( SmPC ) document approved for the U . K . , which is written in English , and is representative of all Iomeron ( iomeprol ) SmPCs for that presentation .
• Copies of the U . K . SmPCs accompany this letter , along with images of the U . K . bottle and box labels that will be imported .
• The Iomeron ( iomeprol ) U . K . SmPCs are available on - line at : https : / / imaging . bracco . com / us - en / products / ct - ct - colonography / iomeron • For those bottles and box labels not in English , English translations of these labels are available on - line at : https : / / imaging . bracco . com / us - en / products / ct - ct - colonography / iomeron There are differences among the currently marketed nonionic , low - osmolar iodinated contrast media in their physico - chemical properties , as can be seen in the below table that compares them at the concentration of 300 mg iodine / mL ( except for Visipaque , for which the nearest concentration is 320 mg iodine / mL ) : Table of Physico - chemical Properties of Iomeron ( iomeprol ) vs .

The U . K . SmPC states that the Iomeron multi - dose bottle stopper should be pierced only once , and that proper withdrawal cannulas for piercing the stopper and drawing up the contrast medium should be used .
For those injectors in which the Iomeron container would be directly inserted ( i . e . , there would be no use of a transfer set ) , the injector manufacturer ’ s procedures for insertion should be followed , keeping in mind that the bottle stopper should be pierced only once .
Microbial contamination studies were performed where Iomeron solutions in multi - dose containers were inoculated with micro - organisms .
These studies demonstrated that Iomeron solutions are bacteriostatic , with microbial growth not observed over the 10 - hour period of the studies .
Based upon these studies , when the 500 mL multi - dose container is used to draw up or administer separate doses of Iomeron , any unused product remaining in the bottle after 10 hours from the stopper being pierced must be discarded .
Please see Appendix 1 of this letter for tables showing the differences among the FDA - approved intra - arterial and intravenous indications for Omnipaque ( iohexol ) , Visipaque ( iodixanol ) , Ultravist ( iopromide ) and Isovue ( iopamidol ) vs . the intra - arterial and intravenous indications for Iomeron ( iomeprol ) approved in the U . K . Iomeron ( iomeprol ) will be available only by prescription in the U . S . However , the imported lots do not have the statement “ Rx only ” on their labeling .
Please refer to the Iomeron ( iomeprol ) U . K . SmPC for the product ’ s full prescribing information .
In addition , please note the following comments and recommendations : • There are differences between indications for Iomeron ( iomeprol ) approved in the U . K . and approved indications for iodinated contrast media ( ICM ) in the US .
Tables comparing indications for selected FDA approved ICM and Iomeron ( iomeprol ) are provided in Appendix 1 .
• We recommend that imported Iomeron ( iomeprol ) be administered only by intravenous and intra - arterial routes .
• We recommend that imported Iomeron ( iomeprol ) be used only in adult patients .
Iomeron ( iomeprol ) adult dosing per the U . K . SmPC is provided in Appendix 2 .
• Obtain a history of allergy , hypersensitivity , or hypersensitivity reactions to iodinated contrast agents and always have emergency resuscitation equipment and trained personnel available prior to Iomeron administration .
Monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions .
• Use the lowest necessary dose of Iomeron ( iomeprol ) in patients with renal impairment or with congestive heart failure .
• Avoid angiocardiography whenever possible in patients with homocystinuria because of the risk of inducing thrombosis and embolism .
• Thyroid storm has occurred after the intravascular use of iodinated contrast agents in patients with hyperthyroidism , or with an autonomously functioning thyroid nodule .
Evaluate the risk in such patients before use of any iodinated contrast agent .
• Administer iodinated contrast agents with extreme caution in patients with known or suspected pheochromocytoma .
Inject the minimum amount of contrast necessary , assess the blood pressure throughout the procedure , and have measures for treatment of a hypertensive crisis readily available .
• Severe cutaneous adverse reaction severity may increase and time to onset may decrease with repeat administration of contrast agents ; prophylactic medications may not prevent or mitigate severe cutaneous adverse reactions .
Avoid administering Iomeron to patients with a history of a severe cutaneous adverse reaction to Iomeron .
• Stop metformin at the time of , or prior to , Iomeron ( Iomeron ) administration in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment , alcoholism or heart failure ; or in patients who will be administered intra - arterial iodinated contrast .
Re - evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure and reinstitute metformin only after renal function is stable .
• Administration of iodinated contrast agents may interfere with thyroid uptake of radioactive iodine ( I - 131 and I - 123 ) and decrease therapeutic and diagnostic efficacy in patients with carcinoma of the thyroid .
The decrease in efficacy lasts for 6 to 8 weeks .
• Renal toxicity has been reported in a few patients with liver dysfunction who were given an oral cholecystographic agent followed by intravascular iodinated contrast agents .
Administration of any intravascular iodinated contrast agent should therefore be postponed in patients who have recently received a cholecystographic contrast agent .
The Iomeron ( iomeprol ) barcode may not register accurately on U . S . barcode scanning systems .
Institutions should manually input the product into their systems and confirm that their systems do not provide incorrect information when the product is scanned .
Alternative procedures should be followed to assure that the correct drug product is being used and administered to individual patients .

Unless otherwise instructed by the doctor , a normal diet may be maintained on the day of the examination .
In myelography , lower doses may be used for lumbar or thoracic studies and higher doses for cervical or total columnar studies .
Regardless of the nature of the myelographic study , Iomeron should be injected slowly over 1 - 2 minutes .
The X ray can be taken up to 60 minutes following injection .
Post myelographic CT of the spinal column should be delayed for approximately four hours to allow dilution and clearance of excessive contrast .
4 . 3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients .
Intrathecal concomitant administration of corticosteroids with contrast media is contraindicated .
4 . 4 Special warnings and special precautions for use In consideration of possible complications , the patient should be kept under observation for at least 30 minutes after the examination .
Extreme caution during injection of contrast media is necessary to avoid extravasation .
Hydration Patients must be well hydrated , and any relevant abnormalities of fluid or electrolyte balance should be corrected prior to and following contrast media injection .
Especially patients with diabetes mellitus , polyuria , oligouria , hyperuricaemia , infants , small children , and elderly patients , should not be exposed to dehydration .
Also patients with severely compromised hepatic and renal impairment are more at risk .
Caution should be exercised in hydrating patients with underlying conditions that may be worsened by fluid overload , including congestive heart failure .
Rehydration prior to use of iomeprol is recommended in patients with sickle cell disease .
Special population Hypersensitivity to iodinated contrast media , allergic predisposition A positive history of allergy , asthma or untoward reaction during previous similar investigations indicates a need for extra caution since , as with other contrast media , this product may provoke anaphylaxis or other manifestations of allergy with nausea , vomiting , dyspnoea , erythema , urticaria and hypotension .
The benefits should clearly outweigh the risks in such patients and appropriate resuscitative measures should be immediately available .
The primary treatments are as follows : Effect Major Symptoms Primary Treatment Vasomotor effect warmth nausea / vomiting reassurance Cutaneous scattered hives severe urticaria H1 - antihistamines H2 - antihistamines Bronchospastic wheezing oxygen Beta - 2 - agonist inhalers Anaphylactoid angioedema oxygen reaction urticaria bronchospasm hypotension iv fluids adrenergics ( iv epinephrine ) Inhaled beta - 2 - adrenergics antihistamines ( H1 - and H2 - blockers ) corticosteroids Hypotensive hypotension iv fluids Vagal reaction hypotension bradycardia iv fluids iv atropine From : Bush WH ; The Contrast Media Manual ; Katzburg RW Ed . ; Williams and Wilkins ; Baltimore 1992 ; Chapter 2 p 23 The risk of bronchospasm - inducing reactions in asthmatic patients is higher after contrast media administration , especially in patients taking beta - blockers .
Hypersensitivity testing In patients with suspected or known hypersensitivity to contrast media , sensitivity test doses are not recommended , as severe or fatal reactions to contrast media are not predictable from sensitivity test .
Myelomatosis or paraproteinaemias are conditions predisposing to renal impairment following CM administration .
The benefits of the use of a contrast - enhanced procedure should be carefully weighted against the possible risk .
Adequate hydration and monitoring of renal function are recommended after CM administration .
Cardiovascular diseases Care should be taken in severe cardiac disease particularly heart failure and coronary artery disease .
Reactions may include pulmonary oedema , haemodynamic changes , ischaemic ECG changes and arrhythmias .
In severe , chronic hypertension the risk of renal damage following administration of a contrast medium is increased .
In these cases the risks associated with the catheterization procedure are increased .
The product should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism or goitre .
Use may interfere with thyroid function tests .
The administration of iodinated contrast media may aggravate myasthenia signs and symptoms .
CNS Disorders Particular care is needed in patients with acute cerebral infarction , acute intracranial haemorrhage and any conditions involving damage to the blood brain barrier , brain oedema or acute demyelination .
Convulsive seizures are more likely in patients with intracranial tumours or metastases or with a history of epilepsy .
Neurological symptoms related to cerebrovascular diseases , intracranial tumours / metastases or degenerative or inflammatory pathologies may be exacerbated .
There is an increased risk of transient neurological complications in patients with symptomatic cerebrovascular disease e . g . stroke , transient ischaemic attacks .
Cerebral ischaemic phenomena may be caused by intravascular injection .
Anticonvulsant therapy should not be discontinued .
In acute and chronic alcoholism the increase in blood brain barrier permeability facilitates the passage of the contrast medium into cerebral tissue possibly leading to CNS disorders .
There is a possibility of a reduced seizure threshold in alcoholics .
In patients with a drug addiction there is also the possibility of a reduced seizure threshold .
Patients with phaeochromocytoma may develop severe , occasionally uncontrollable hypertensive crises during intra - arterial administration .
Premedication with an alpha and beta receptor blocker is recommended in these patients .
Pronounced excitement , anxiety and pain can cause side effects or intensify reaction to the contrast medium .
A sedative may be given .
Renal impairment In patients with moderate to severe impairment of renal function , attention should be paid to renal function parameters before re - examining the patient with a contrast media .
Preventive measures include : • identification of high - risk patients ; • ensuring adequate hydration before CM administration , preferably by maintaining i . v . infusion before and during the procedure and until the CM has been cleared by the kidneys ; avoiding whenever possible , the administration of nephrotoxic drugs or major surgery or procedure such as renal angioplasty , until the CM has been cleared ; A combination of severe hepatic and renal impairment delays excretion of the contrast medium therefore such patients should not be examined unless absolutely necessary .
Diabetes mellitus Care should be taken in renal impairment and diabetes .
In these patients it is important to maintain hydration in order to minimise deterioration in renal function .
The presence of renal damage in diabetic patients is one of the factors predisposing to renal impairment following contrast media administration .
This may precipitate lactic acidosis in patients who are taking metformin ( see section 4 . 5 - Interaction with medicaments and other forms of interaction ) .
Children : Infants up to 1 year , especially the new - born , are particularly susceptible to electrolyte imbalance and haemodynamic alterations .
Care should be taken regarding the dosage used .
Transient hypothyroidism may occur in neonates when the mother or the neonate has received an iodinated contrast agent .
Thyroid function tests ( usually TSH and T4 ) are recommended in neonates 7 - 10 days and 1 month after exposure to Iomeron especially in preterm neonates .
Elderly : There is special risk of reactions involving the circulatory system such that myocardial ischaemia , major arrhythmias and extrasystoles are more likely to occur .
A combination of neurological disturbances and vascular pathologies present a serious complication .
The probability of acute renal insufficiencies is higher in these people .
Precautions for dedicated exams Angiography Non ionic contrast media have less antiocoagulant activity in vitro than ionic media .
Meticulous attention should therefore be paid to angiographic technique .
Non ionic media should not be allowed to remain in contact with blood in a syringe , and intravascular catheters should be flushed frequently to minimise the risk of clotting which , rarely , has led to serious thromboembolic complications .
Intravascular administration should be performed if possible with the patient lying down .
The patient should be kept in this position and closely observed for at least 30 minutes after the procedure since the majority of severe incidents occur with this time .
Myelography Following intrathecal use , the patient should rest with the head and the chest elevated for 1 hour and be kept well hydrated .
Thereafter , he / she may ambulate carefully , but bending down must be avoided .
If remaining in bed , the head and chest should be kept elevated for 6 hours .
Patients , suspected of having a lower seizure threshold should be observed during this period .
Venography Special care is required when venography is performed in patients with thrombosis , phlebitis , severe ischaemic disease , local infection or a totally obstructed artero - venous system .
4 . 5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Use of the product may interfere with tests for thyroid function .
Vasopressor agents should not be administered prior to iomeprol .
Treatment with drugs that lower the seizure threshold such as certain neuroleptics ( MAO inhibitors , tricyclic antidepressants ) , analeptics , and anti - emetics and phenotiazine derivatives should be discontinued 48 hours before the examination .
Treatment should not be resumed until 24 hours post - procedure .
It has been reported that cardiac and / or hypertensive patients under treatment with diuretics , ACE - inhibitors , and / or beta blocking agents are at higher risk of adverse reactions when administered iodinated contrast media .
Beta - blockers may impair the response to treatment of bronchospasm induced by contrast medium .
Patients with normal renal function can continue to take metformin normally .
In diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy , under treatment with metformin and with moderate renal impairment , metformin should be stopped at the time of , or prior to the procedure and withheld for 48 hours subsequent to the procedure and reinstituted only after renal function has been re - evaluated and found to be normal In emergency patients in whom renal function is either impaired or unknown , the physician shall weigh out risk and benefit of an examination with a contrast medium and take precautions .
Metformin should be stopped from time of contrast medium administration .
After the procedure the patient should be monitored for signs of lactic acidosis .
Metformin should be restarted 48 hours after contrast medium if serum creatinine / eGFR is unchanged from the pre - imaging level .
Allergy - like reactions to contrast media are more frequent and may manifest as delayed reactions in patients treated with immuno - modulators , like Interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) .
Epidural and intrathecal corticosteroids should never be concurrently administered when iodinated contrast media are used , because corticosteroids may promote and affect the signs and symptoms of arachnoiditis ( see section 4 . 3 - Contraindications ) .
4 . 6 Fertility , pregnancy and lactation Women of childbearing potential Appropriate investigations and measures should be taken when exposing women of child - bearing potential to any X - ray examination , whether with or without contrast medium .
Pregnancy Animal studies have not indicated any harmful effects with respect to the course of pregnancy or on the health of the unborn or neonate .
The safety of iomeprol in human pregnancy however has not been established .
Therefore avoid in pregnancy unless there is no safer alternative .
Since , wherever possible , exposure to radiation should be avoided during pregnancy , the benefits of any X ray examination , whether with or without contrast material , should for this reason alone be carefully weighed against the possible risk .
Breastfeeding No human data exist concerning the excretion of iomeprol in breast milk .
Animal studies have demonstrated that the excretion of iomeprol in breast milk is similar to that of other contrast agents and that these compounds are only minimally absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract of the young .
Adverse effects on the nursing infant are therefore unlikely to occur .
Stopping breastfeeding is unnecessary .
4 . 7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines There is no known effect on the ability to drive and operate machines .
After intrathecal administration , it is recommended that the patient should wait 24 hours before driving or operating machinery .
4 . 8 Undesirable effects General The use of iodinated contrast media may cause untoward side effects .
They are usually mild to moderate and transient in nature .
However , severe and life - threatening reactions sometimes leading to death have been reported .
In most cases , reactions occur within minutes of dosing but at times reactions may occur at later time .
Anaphylaxis ( anaphylactoid / hypersensitivity reactions ) may manifest with various symptoms , and rarely does any one patient develop all the symptoms .
Typically , in 1 to 15 min ( but rarely after as long as 2 h ) , the patient complains of feeling abnormal , agitation , flushing , feeling hot , sweating increased , dizziness , increased lacrimation , rhinitis , palpitations , paresthesia , pruritus , sore throat and throat tightness , dysphagia , cough , sneezing , urticaria , erythema , mild localised oedema , angioneurotic oedema and dyspnoea due to glottic / laryngeal / pharyngeal oedema and / or spasm manifesting with wheezing , and bronchospasm .
Nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , and diarrhoea are also reported .
These reactions , which can occur independently of the dose administered or the route of administration , may represent the first signs of circulatory collapse .
Administration of the contrast medium must be discontinued immediately and , if needed , appropriate specific treatment urgently initiated via venous access .
Severe reactions involving the cardiovascular system , such as vasodilatation , with pronounced hypotension , tachycardia , dyspnoea , agitation , cyanosis and loss of consciousness progressing to respiratory and / or cardiac arrest may result in death .
These events can occur rapidly and require full and aggressive cardio - pulmonary resuscitation .
Primary circulatory collapse can occur as the only and / or initial presentation without respiratory symptoms or without other signs or symptoms outlined above .

Vasospasm and consequent ischaemia have been observed during intra - arterial injections of contrast medium , in particular after coronary and cerebral angiography often procedurally related and possibly triggered by the tip of the catheter or excess catheter pressure .
As with other iodinated contrast media , very rare cases of mucocutaneous syndromes , including Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis ( Lyell syndrome ) and erythema multiforme , have been reported following the administration of Iomeprol injection .
Paediatric patients There is limited experience with paediatric patients .
The clinical trial paediatric safety database comprises 167 patients .
The Iomeprol safety profile is similar in children and adults .
4 . 8 . 2 Intrathecal administration Adults Adults patients involved in clinical trials with intrathecal administration of Iomeprol were 388 .
The most frequently reported adverse reactions following intrathecal administration of Iomeprol are headache , dizziness , nausea , vomiting and back pain .
These reactions are usually mild to moderate and transient in nature .
Rarely , headache may persist for days .
Most side effects occur some hours ( 3 to 6 hours ) after the procedure , due to the distribution of the contrast medium in the CSF circulation from the site of administration to the intravascular space ( see section 5 . 2 : Pharmacokinetic properties ) .
Most reactions usually occur within 24 hours after injection .
* Since the reactions were not observed during clinical trials with 388 patients , best estimate is that their relative occurrence is uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to < 1 / 100 .
The most appropriate MedDRA term is used to describe a certain reaction and its symptoms and related conditions .
** Injection site reactions comprise application site pain , injection site discomfort , injection site pain and injection site warmth .

4 . 8 . 3 Administration to body cavities After injection of an iodinated contrast media in body cavities , contrast media are slowly absorbed from the area of administration into the systemic circulation and subsequently cleared by renal elimination .
Blood amylase increased is common following ERCP .
Very rare cases of pancreatitis have been described .
The reactions reported in cases of arthrography and fistulography usually represent irritative manifestations superimposed on pre - existing conditions of tissue inflammation .
Hypersensitivity reactions are rare , generally mild and in the form of skin reactions .
However , the possibility of severe anaphylactoid reactions cannot be excluded .
As with other iodinated contrast media , pelvic pain and malaise may occur after hysterosalpingography .
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important .
It allows continued monitoring of the benefit / risk balance of the medicinal product .
Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the Yellow Card Scheme Website : www . mhra . gov . uk / yellowcard or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store .
4 . 9 Overdose The effects of overdose on the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems may become life - threatening .
Treatment consists of support of the vital functions and prompt use of symptomatic therapy .
Iomeprol does not bind to plasma or serum proteins and is therefore dialyzable .
5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5 . 1 Pharmacodynamic properties ATC code : V08AB10 Iomeprol is a low osmolality , non - ionic organic molecule with radio - opacity conferred by an iodine content of 49 % of the molecular weight .
It is formulated for use as an intravascular / intracavitary / intrathecal contrast medium in concentrations of up to 400 mg iodine per ml .
Even at this concentration the low viscosity allows delivery of high doses through thin catheters .
5 . 2 Pharmacokinetic properties The pharmacokinetics of intravascularly administered iomeprol are similar to those of other iodinated contrast media and conform to a two - compartment model with a rapid distribution and a slower elimination phase .
In healthy subjects , the mean distribution and elimination half - lives of iomeprol were 0 . 5 hours and 1 . 9 hours respectively .
Distribution volume is similar to that of extra cellular fluid .
There is no significant serum protein binding and iomeprol is not metabolized .
Elimination is almost exclusively through the kidneys ( 90 % of the dose recovered in the urine within 96 hours of its administration ) and is rapid ( 50 % of an intravascularly administered dose within 2 hours ) .
Following intrathecal administration to animals , iomeprol is completely cleared from the CSF and passes into the plasma compartment .
5 . 3 Preclinical Safety Data Pre - clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , toxicity to reproduction .
Results from studies in rats , mice and dogs demonstrate that iomeprol has an acute intravenous or intra - arterial toxicity similar to that of the other non ionic contrast media , as well as a good systemic tolerability after repeated intravenous administrations in rats and dogs .

Unless otherwise instructed by the doctor , a normal diet may be maintained on the day of the examination .
In myelography , lower doses may be used for lumbar or thoracic studies and higher doses for cervical or total columnar studies .
Regardless of the nature of the myelographic study , Iomeron should be injected slowly over 1 - 2 minutes .
The X ray can be taken up to 60 minutes following injection .
Post myelographic CT of the spinal column should be delayed for approximately four hours to allow dilution and clearance of excessive contrast .
4 . 3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients .
Intrathecal concomitant administration of corticosteroids with contrast media is contraindicated .
4 . 4 Special warnings and special precautions for use In consideration of possible complications , the patient should be kept under observation for at least 30 minutes after the examination .
Extreme caution during injection of contrast media is necessary to avoid extravasation .
Hydration Patients must be well hydrated , and any relevant abnormalities of fluid or electrolyte balance should be corrected prior to and following contrast media injection .
Especially patients with diabetes mellitus , polyuria , oligouria , hyperuricaemia , infants , small children , and elderly patients , should not be exposed to dehydration .
Also patients with severely compromised hepatic and renal impairment are more at risk .
Caution should be exercised in hydrating patients with underlying conditions that may be worsened by fluid overload , including congestive heart failure .
Rehydration prior to use of iomeprol is recommended in patients with sickle cell disease .
Special population Hypersensitivity to iodinated contrast media , allergic predisposition A positive history of allergy , asthma or untoward reaction during previous similar investigations indicates a need for extra caution since , as with other contrast media , this product may provoke anaphylaxis or other manifestations of allergy with nausea , vomiting , dyspnoea , erythema , urticaria and hypotension .
The benefits should clearly outweigh the risks in such patients and appropriate resuscitative measures should be immediately available .
The primary treatments are as follows : Effect Major Symptoms Primary Treatment Vasomotor effect warmth nausea / vomiting reassurance Cutaneous scattered hives severe urticaria H1 - antihistamines H2 - antihistamines Bronchospastic wheezing oxygen Beta - 2 - agonist inhalers Anaphylactoid angioedema oxygen reaction urticaria bronchospasm hypotension iv fluids adrenergics ( iv epinephrine ) Inhaled beta - 2 - adrenergics antihistamines ( H1 - and H2 - blockers ) corticosteroids Hypotensive hypotension iv fluids Vagal reaction hypotension bradycardia iv fluids iv atropine From : Bush WH ; The Contrast Media Manual ; Katzburg RW Ed . ; Williams and Wilkins ; Baltimore 1992 ; Chapter 2 p 23 The risk of bronchospasm - inducing reactions in asthmatic patients is higher after contrast media administration , especially in patients taking beta - blockers .
Hypersensitivity testing In patients with suspected or known hypersensitivity to contrast media , sensitivity test doses are not recommended , as severe or fatal reactions to contrast media are not predictable from sensitivity test .
Myelomatosis or paraproteinaemias are conditions predisposing to renal impairment following CM administration .
The benefits of the use of a contrast - enhanced procedure should be carefully weighted against the possible risk .
Adequate hydration and monitoring of renal function are recommended after CM administration .
Cardiovascular diseases Care should be taken in severe cardiac disease particularly heart failure and coronary artery disease .
Reactions may include pulmonary oedema , haemodynamic changes , ischaemic ECG changes and arrhythmias .
In severe , chronic hypertension the risk of renal damage following administration of a contrast medium is increased .
In these cases the risks associated with the catheterization procedure are increased .
The product should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism or goitre .
Use may interfere with thyroid function tests .
The administration of iodinated contrast media may aggravate myasthenia signs and symptoms .
CNS Disorders Particular care is needed in patients with acute cerebral infarction , acute intracranial haemorrhage and any conditions involving damage to the blood brain barrier , brain oedema or acute demyelination .
Convulsive seizures are more likely in patients with intracranial tumours or metastases or with a history of epilepsy .
Neurological symptoms related to cerebrovascular diseases , intracranial tumours / metastases or degenerative or inflammatory pathologies may be exacerbated .
There is an increased risk of transient neurological complications in patients with symptomatic cerebrovascular disease eg stroke , transient ischaemic attacks .
Cerebral ischaemic phenomena may be caused by intravascular injection .
Anticonvulsant therapy should not be discontinued .
In acute and chronic alcoholism the increase in blood brain barrier permeability facilitates the passage of the contrast medium into cerebral tissue possibly leading to CMS disorders .
There is a possibility of a reduced seizure threshold in alcoholics .
In patients with a drug addiction there is also the possibility of a reduced seizure threshold .
Patients with phaeochromocytoma may develop severe , occasionally uncontrollable hypertensive crises during intra - arterial administration .
Premedication with an alpha and beta receptor blocker is recommended in these patients .
Pronounced excitement , anxiety and pain can cause side effects or intensify reaction to the contrast medium .
A sedative may be given .
Renal impairment In patients with moderate to severe impairment of renal function , attention should be paid to renal function parameters , in particular before re - examining the patient with a contrast media .
Preventive measures include : • identification of high - risk patients ; • ensuring adequate hydration before CM administration , preferably by maintaining i . v . infusion before and during the procedure and until the CM has been cleared by the kidneys ; avoiding whenever possible , the administration of nephrotoxic drugs or major surgery or procedure such as renal angioplasty , until the CM has been cleared ; A combination of severe hepatic and renal impairment delays excretion of the contrast medium therefore such patients should not be examined unless absolutely necessary .
Diabetes mellitus Care should be taken in renal impairment and diabetes .
In these patients it is important to maintain hydration in order to minimise deterioration in renal function .
The presence of renal damage in diabetic patients is one of the factors predisposing to renal impairment following contrast media administration .
This may precipitate lactic acidosis in patients who are taking metformin ( see section 4 . 5 - Interaction with medicaments and other forms of interaction ) .
Children : Infants up to 1 year , especially the new - born , are particularly susceptible to electrolyte imbalance and haemodynamic alterations .
Care should be taken regarding the dosage used .
Transient hypothyroidism may occur in neonates when the mother or the neonate has received an iodinated contrast agent .
Thyroid function tests ( usually TSH and T4 ) are recommended in neonates 7 - 10 days and 1 month after exposure to Iomeron especially in preterm neonates .
Elderly : There is special risk of reactions involving the circulatory system such that myocardial ischaemia , major arrhythmias and extrasystoles are more likely to occur .
A combination of neurological disturbances and vascular pathologies present a serious complication .
The probability of acute renal insufficiencies is higher in these people .
Precautions for dedicated exams Angiography Non ionic contrast media have less antiocoagulant activity in vitro than ionic media .
Meticulous attention should therefore be paid to angiographic technique .
Non ionic media should not be allowed to remain in contact with blood in a syringe , and intravascular catheters should be flushed frequently to minimise the risk of clotting which , rarely , has led to serious thromboembolic complications .
Intravascular administration should be performed if possible with the patient lying down .
The patient should be kept in this position and closely observed for at least 30 minutes after the procedure since the majority of severe incidents occur with this time .
Myelography Following intrathecal use , the patient should rest with the head and the chest elevated for 1 hour and be kept well hydrated .
Thereafter , he / she may ambulate carefully , but bending down must be avoided .
If remaining in bed , the head and chest should be kept elevated for 6 hours .
Patients , suspected of having a lower seizure threshold should be observed during this period .
Venography Special care is required when venography is performed in patients with thrombosis , phlebitis , severe ischaemic disease , local infection or a totally obstructed artero - venous system .
4 . 5 Interaction with other medicaments and other forms of interaction Use of the product may interfere with tests for thyroid function .
Vasopressor agents should not be administered prior to iomeprol .
Treatment with drugs that lower the seizure threshold such as certain neuroleptics ( MAO inhibitors , tricyclic antidepressants ) , analeptics , and anti - emetics and phenotiazine derivatives should be discontinued 48 hours before the examination .
Treatment should not be resumed until 24 hours post - procedure .
It has been reported that cardiac and / or hypertensive patients under treatment with diuretics , ACE - inhibitors , and / or beta blocking agents are at higher risk of adverse reactions when administered iodinated contrast media .
Beta - blockers may impair the response to treatment of bronchospasm induced by contrast medium .
Patients with normal renal function can continue to take metformin normally .
In diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy , under treatment with metformin and with moderate renal impairment , metformin should be stopped at the time of , or prior to the procedure and withheld for 48 hours subsequent to the procedure and reinstituted only after renal function has been re - evaluated and found to be normal In emergency patients in whom renal function is either impaired or unknown , the physician shall weigh out risk and benefit of an examination with a contrast medium and take precautions .
Metformin should be stopped from time of contrast medium administration .
After the procedure the patient should be monitored for signs of lactic acidosis .
Metformin should be restarted 48 hours after contrast medium if serum creatinine / eGFR is unchanged from the pre - imaging level .
Allergy - like reactions to contrast media are more frequent and may manifest as delayed reactions in patients treated with immuno - modulators , like Interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) .
Epidural and intrathecal corticosteroids should never be concurrently administered when iodinated contrast media are used , because corticosteroids may promote and affect the signs and symptoms of arachnoiditis ( see section 4 . 3 - Contraindications ) .
4 . 6 Fertility , pregnancy and lactation Women of childbearing potential Appropriate investigations and measures should be taken when exposing women of child - bearing potential to any X - ray examination , whether with or without contrast medium .
Pregnancy Animal studies have not indicated any harmful effects with respect to the course of pregnancy or on the health of the unborn or neonate .
The safety of iomeprol in human pregnancy however has not been established .
Therefore avoid in pregnancy unless there is no safer alternative .
Since , wherever possible , exposure to radiation should be avoided during pregnancy , the benefits of any X ray examination , whether with or without contrast material , should for this reason alone be carefully weighed against the possible risk .

Nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , and diarrhoea are also reported .
These reactions , which can occur independently of the dose administered or the route of administration , may represent the first signs of circulatory collapse .
Administration of the contrast medium must be discontinued immediately and , if needed , appropriate specific treatment urgently initiated via venous access .

4 . 8 . 3 Administration to body cavities After injection of an iodinated contrast media in body cavities , contrast media are slowly absorbed from the area of administration into the systemic circulation and subsequently cleared by renal elimination .
Blood amylase increased is common following ERCP .
Very rare cases of pancreatitis have been described .
The reactions reported in cases of arthrography and fistulography usually represent irritative manifestations superimposed on pre - existing conditions of tissue inflammation .
Hypersensitivity reactions are rare , generally mild and in the form of skin reactions .
However , the possibility of severe anaphylactoid reactions cannot be excluded .
As with other iodinated contrast media , pelvic pain and malaise may occur after hysterosalpingography .
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important .
It allows continued monitoring of the benefit / risk balance of the medicinal product .
Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the Yellow Card Scheme Website : www . mhra . gov . uk / yellowcard or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store .
4 . 9 Overdose The effects of overdose on the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems may become life - threatening .
Treatment consists of support of the vital functions and prompt use of symptomatic therapy .
Iomeprol does not bind to plasma or serum proteins and is therefore dialyzable .
5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5 . 1 Pharmacodynamic properties ATC code : V08AB10 Iomeprol is a low osmolality , non - ionic organic molecule with radio - opacity conferred by an iodine content of 49 % of the molecular weight .
It is formulated for use as an intravascular / intracavitary / intrathecal contrast medium in concentrations of up to 400 mg iodine per ml .
Even at this concentration the low viscosity allows delivery of high doses through thin catheters .
5 . 2 Pharmacokinetic properties The pharmacokinetics of intravascularly administered iomeprol are similar to those of other iodinated contrast media and conform to a two - compartment model with a rapid distribution and a slower elimination phase .
In healthy subjects , the mean distribution and elimination half - lives of iomeprol were 0 . 5 hours and 1 . 9 hours respectively .
Distribution volume is similar to that of extra cellular fluid .
There is no significant serum protein binding and iomeprol is not metabolized .
Elimination is almost exclusively through the kidneys ( 90 % of the dose recovered in the urine within 96 hours of its administration ) and is rapid ( 50 % of an intravascularly administered dose within 2 hours ) .
Following intrathecal administration to animals , iomeprol is completely cleared from the CSF and passes into the plasma compartment .
5 . 3 Preclinical Safety Data Pre - clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , toxicity to reproduction .
Results from studies in rats , mice and dogs demonstrate that iomeprol has an acute intravenous or intra - arterial toxicity similar to that of the other non ionic contrast media , as well as a good systemic tolerability after repeated intravenous administrations in rats and dogs .

Unless otherwise instructed by the doctor , a normal diet may be maintained on the day of the examination .
The X ray can be taken up to 60 minutes following injection .
4 . 3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients .
4 . 4 Special warnings and special precautions for use In consideration of possible complications , the patient should be kept under observation for at least 30 minutes after the examination .
Extreme caution during injection of contrast media is necessary to avoid extravasation .
Hydration Patients must be well hydrated , and any relevant abnormalities of fluid or electrolyte balance should be corrected prior to and following contrast media injection .
Especially patients with diabetes mellitus , polyuria , oligouria , hyperuricaemia , infants , small children , and elderly patients , should not be exposed to dehydration .
Also patients with severely compromised hepatic and renal impairment are more at risk .
Caution should be exercised in hydrating patients with underlying conditions that may be worsened by fluid overload , including congestive heart failure .
Rehydration prior to use of iomeprol is recommended in patients with sickle cell disease .
Special population Hypersensitivity to iodinated contrast media , allergic predisposition A positive history of allergy , asthma or untoward reaction during previous similar investigations indicates a need for extra caution since , as with other contrast media , this product may provoke anaphylaxis or other manifestations of allergy with nausea , vomiting , dyspnoea , erythema , urticaria and hypotension .
The benefits should clearly outweigh the risks in such patients and appropriate resuscitative measures should be immediately available .
The primary treatments are as follows : Effect Major Symptoms Primary Treatment Vasomotor effect warmth nausea / vomiting reassurance Cutaneous scattered hives severe urticaria H1 - antihistamines H2 - antihistamines Bronchospastic wheezing oxygen Beta - 2 - agonist inhalers Anaphylactoid angioedema oxygen reaction urticaria bronchospasm hypotension iv fluids adrenergics ( iv epinephrine ) Inhaled beta - 2 - adrenergics antihistamines ( H1 - and H2 - blockers ) corticosteroids Hypotensive hypotension iv fluids Vagal reaction hypotension bradycardia iv fluids iv atropine From : Bush WH ; The Contrast Media Manual ; Katzburg RW Ed . ; Williams and Wilkins ; Baltimore 1992 ; Chapter 2 p 23 The risk of bronchospasm - inducing reactions in asthmatic patients is higher after contrast media administration , especially in patients taking beta - blockers .
Hypersensitivity testing In patients with suspected or known hypersensitivity to contrast media , sensitivity test doses are not recommended , as severe or fatal reactions to contrast media are not predictable from sensitivity test .
Myelomatosis or paraproteinaemias are conditions predisposing to renal impairment following CM administration .
The benefits of the use of a contrast - enhanced procedure should be carefully weighted against the possible risk .
Adequate hydration and monitoring of renal function are recommended after CM administration .
Cardiovascular diseases Care should be taken in severe cardiac disease particularly heart failure and coronary artery disease .
Reactions may include pulmonary oedema , haemodynamic changes , ischaemic ECG changes and arrhythmias .
In severe , chronic hypertension the risk of renal damage following administration of a contrast medium is increased .
In these cases the risks associated with the catheterization procedure are increased .
The product should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism or goitre .
Use may interfere with thyroid function tests .
The administration of iodinated contrast media may aggravate myasthenia signs and symptoms .
CNS Disorders Particular care is needed in patients with acute cerebral infarction , acute intracranial haemorrhage and any conditions involving damage to the blood brain barrier , brain oedema or acute demyelination .
Convulsive seizures are more likely in patients with intracranial tumours or metastases or with a history of epilepsy .
Neurological symptoms related to cerebrovascular diseases , intracranial tumours / metastases or degenerative or inflammatory pathologies may be exacerbated .
There is an increased risk of transient neurological complications in patients with symptomatic cerebrovascular disease eg stroke , transient ischaemic attacks .
Cerebral ischaemic phenomena may be caused by intravascular injection .
Anticonvulsant therapy should not be discontinued .
In acute and chronic alcoholism the increase in blood brain barrier permeability facilitates the passage of contrast medium into cerebral tissue possibly leading to CNS disorders .
There is a possibility of a reduced seizure threshold in alcoholics .
In patients with a drug addiction there is also the possibility of a reduced seizure threshold .
Patients with phaeochromocytoma may develop severe , occasionally uncontrollable hypertensive crises during intra - arterial administration .
Premedication with an alpha and beta receptor blocker is recommended in these patients .
Pronounced excitement , anxiety and pain can cause side effects or intensify reaction to the contrast medium .
A sedative may be given .
Renal impairment In patients with moderate to severe impairment of renal function , attention should be paid to renal function parameters before re - examining the patient with a contrast media .
Preventive measures include : • identification of high - risk patients ; • ensuring adequate hydration before CM administration , preferably by maintaining i . v . infusion before and during the procedure and until the CM has been cleared by the kidneys ; avoiding whenever possible , the administration of nephrotoxic drugs or major surgery or procedure such as renal angioplasty , until the CM has been cleared ; A combination of severe hepatic and renal impairment delays excretion of the contrast medium therefore such patients should not be examined unless absolutely necessary .
Diabetes mellitus Care should be taken in renal impairment and diabetes .
In these patients it is important to maintain hydration in order to minimise deterioration in renal function .
The presence of renal damage in diabetic patients is one of the factors predisposing to renal impairment following contrast media administration .
This may precipitate lactic acidosis in patients who are taking metformin ( see section 4 . 5 - Interaction with medicaments and other forms of interaction ) .
Children : Infants up to 1 year , especially the new - born , are particularly susceptible to electrolyte imbalance and haemodynamic alterations .
Care should be taken regarding the dosage used .
Transient hypothyroidism may occur in neonates when the mother or the neonate has received an iodinated contrast agent .
Thyroid function tests ( usually TSH and T4 ) are recommended in neonates 7 - 10 days and 1 month after exposure to Iomeron especially in preterm neonates .
Elderly : There is special risk of reactions involving the circulatory system such that myocardial ischaemia , major arrhythmias and extrasystoles are more likely to occur .
A combination of neurological disturbances and vascular pathologies present a serious complication .
The probability of acute renal insufficiencies is higher in these people .
Precautions for dedicated exams Angiography Non ionic contrast media have less antiocoagulant activity in vitro than ionic media .
Meticulous attention should therefore be paid to angiographic technique .
Non ionic media should not be allowed to remain in contact with blood in a syringe , and intravascular catheters should be flushed frequently to minimise the risk of clotting which , rarely , has led to serious thromboembolic complications .
Intravascular administration should be performed if possible with the patient lying down .
The patient should be kept in this position and closely observed for at least 30 minutes after the procedure since the majority of severe incidents occur with this time .
Venography Special care is required when venography is performed in patients with thrombosis , phlebitis , severe ischaemic disease , local infection or a totally obstructed artero - venous system .
4 . 5 Interaction with other medicaments and other forms of interaction Use of the product may interfere with tests for thyroid function .
Vasopressor agents should not be administered prior to iomeprol .
Treatment with drugs that lower the seizure threshold such as certain neuroleptics ( MAO inhibitors , tricyclic antidepressants ) , analeptics , and anti - emetics and phenotiazine derivatives should be discontinued 48 hours before the examination .
Treatment should not be resumed until 24 hours post - procedure .
It has been reported that cardiac and / or hypertensive patients under treatment with diuretics , ACE - inhibitors , and / or beta blocking agents are at higher risk of adverse reactions when administered iodinated contrast media .
Beta - blockers may impair the response to treatment of bronchospasm induced by contrast medium .
Patients with normal renal function can continue to take metformin normally .
In diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy , under treatment with metformin and with moderate renal impairment , metformin should be stopped at the time of , or prior to the procedure and withheld for 48 hours subsequent to the procedure and reinstituted only after renal function has been re - evaluated and found to be normal In emergency patients in whom renal function is either impaired or unknown , the physician shall weigh out risk and benefit of an examination with a contrast medium and take precautions .
Metformin should be stopped from time of contrast medium administration .
After the procedure the patient should be monitored for signs of lactic acidosis .
Metformin should be restarted 48 hours after contrast medium if serum creatinine / eGFR is unchanged from the pre - imaging level .
Allergy - like reactions to contrast media are more frequent and may manifest as delayed reactions in patients treated with immuno - modulators , like Interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) .
4 . 6 Fertility , pregnancy and lactation Women of childbearing potential Appropriate investigations and measures should be taken when exposing women of child - bearing potential to any X - ray examination , whether with or without contrast medium .
Pregnancy Animal studies have not indicated any harmful effects with respect to the course of pregnancy or on the health of the unborn or neonate .
The safety of iomeprol in human pregnancy however has not been established .
Therefore avoid in pregnancy unless there is no safer alternative .
Breastfeeding No human data exist concerning the excretion of iomeprol in breast milk .
Animal studies have demonstrated that the excretion of iomeprol in breast milk is similar to that of other contrast agents and that these compounds are only minimally absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract of the young .
Adverse effects on the nursing infant are therefore unlikely to occur .
Stopping breastfeeding is unnecessary .
4 . 7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines There is no known effect on the ability to drive and operate machines .
4 . 8 Undesirable effects General The use of iodinated contrast media may cause untoward side effects .
They are usually mild to moderate and transient in nature .
However , severe and life - threatening reactions sometimes leading to death have been reported .
In most cases , reactions occur within minutes of dosing but at times reactions may occur at later time .
Anaphylaxis ( anaphylactoid / hypersensitivity reactions ) may manifest with various symptoms , and rarely does any one patient develop all the symptoms .
Typically , in 1 to 15 min ( but rarely after as long as 2 h ) , the patient complains of feeling abnormal , agitation , flushing , feeling hot , sweating increased , dizziness , increased lacrimation , rhinitis , palpitations , paresthesia , pruritus , sore throat and throat tightness , dysphagia , cough , sneezing , urticaria , erythema , mild localised oedema , angioneurotic oedema and dyspnoea due to glottic / laryngeal / pharyngeal oedema and / or spasm manifesting with wheezing , and bronchospasm .
Nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , and diarrhoea are also reported .
These reactions , which can occur independently of the dose administered or the route of administration , may represent the first signs of circulatory collapse .
Administration of the contrast medium must be discontinued immediately and , if needed , appropriate specific treatment urgently initiated via venous access .
Severe reactions involving the cardiovascular system , such as vasodilatation , with pronounced hypotension , tachycardia , dyspnoea , agitation , cyanosis and loss of consciousness progressing to respiratory and / or cardiac arrest may result in death .
These events can occur rapidly and require full and aggressive cardio - pulmonary resuscitation .
Primary circulatory collapse can occur as the only and / or initial presentation without respiratory symptoms or without other signs or symptoms outlined above .
The adverse reactions reported in clinical trials among 4 , 903 adult patients and from post - marketing surveillance are represented in the tables below by frequency and classified by MedDRA system organ class .
Within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
4 . 8 . 1 Intravascular administration Adult patients involved in clinical trials with intravascular administration of Iomeprol were 4 , 515 .
* Since the reactions were not observed during clinical trials with 4515 patients , best estimate is that their relative occurrence is rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 , 000 to < 1 / 1000 ) .
The most appropriate MedDRA term is used to describe a certain reaction and its symptoms and related conditions .
** Injection site reactions comprise injection site pain and swelling .
In the majority of cases they are due to extravasation of contrast medium .
These reactions are usually transient and result in recovery without sequelae .
Cases of extravasation with inflammation , skin necrosis and even development of compartment syndrome have been reported .
Adults System Organ Class Adverse Reactions Clinical Trials Post - marketing Surveillance Common ( ≥ 1 / 100 t o < 1 / 10 ) Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to < 1 / 100 ) Rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 , 000 to < 1 / 1000 ) Frequency unknown * Blood and lymphatic system disorders Thrombocytopenia , Haemolytic anaemia Immune system disorders Anaphylactoid reaction Psychiatric disorders Anxiety Confusional state Nervous system disorders Headache Dizziness Presyncope Coma Transient ischaemic attack Paralysis Syncope Convulsion Loss of consciousness Dysarthria Paraesthesia Amnesia Somnolence Taste abnormality Eye disorders Blindness transient Visual disturbance Conjunctivitis Lacrimation increased Photopsia Cardiac disorders Bradycardia Tachycardia Extrasystoles Cardiac arrest Myocardial infarction Cardiac failure Angina pectoris Arrhythmia Ventricular or atrial fibrillation Atrioventricular block Palpitations Cyanosis Vascular disorders Hypertension Hypotension Circulatory collapse or shock Hot flush Flushing Pallor Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders Dyspnoea Respiratory arrest Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) Pulmonary oedema Laryngeal oedema Pharyngeal oedema Bronchospasm Asthma Cough Hyperventilation Pharynx discomfort Laryngeal discomfort Rhinitis Dysphonia Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea Vomiting Diarrhoea Abdominal pain Salivary hypersecretion Dysphagia Salivary gland enlargement Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Erythema Urticaria Pruritus Rash Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis Angioedema Cold sweat Sweating increased Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder Back pain Arthralgia Renal and urinary disorders Renal failure General disorders and administration site conditions Feeling hot Chest pain Injection site warmth and pain Asthenia Rigors Pyrexia Injection site reaction ** Coldness local Fatigue Malaise Thirst Investigations Blood creatinine increased Electrocardiogram ST segment elevation Electrocardiogram abnormal Coronary artery thrombosis and coronary artery embolism have been reported as a complication of coronary catheterization procedures .
Vasospasm and consequent ischaemia have been observed during intra - arterial injections of contrast medium , in particular after coronary and cerebral angiography often procedurally related and possibly triggered by the tip of the catheter or excess catheter pressure .
As with other iodinated contrast media , very rare cases of mucocutaneous syndromes , including Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis ( Lyell syndrome ) and erythema multiforme , have been reported following the administration of Iomeprol injection .
Paediatric patients There is limited experience with paediatric patients .
The clinical trial paediatric safety database comprises 167 patients .
The Iomeprol safety profile is similar in children and adults .
4 . 8 . 2 Administration to body cavities After injection of an iodinated contrast media in body cavities , contrast media are slowly absorbed from the area of administration into the systemic circulation and subsequently cleared by renal elimination .
Blood amylase increased is common following ERCP .

4 . 3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients .
4 . 4 Special warnings and special precautions for use In consideration of possible complications , the patient should be kept under observation for at least 30 minutes after the examination .
Extreme caution during injection of contrast media is necessary to avoid extravasation .
Hydration Patients must be well hydrated , and any relevant abnormalities of fluid or electrolyte balance should be corrected prior to and following contrast media injection .
Especially patients with diabetes mellitus , polyuria , oligouria , hyperuricaemia , infants , small children , and elderly patients , should not be exposed to dehydration .
Also patients with severely compromised hepatic and renal impairment are more at risk .
Caution should be exercised in hydrating patients with underlying conditions that may be worsened by fluid overload , including congestive heart failure .
Rehydration prior to use of iomeprol is recommended in patients with sickle cell disease .
Special population Hypersensitivity to iodinated contrast media , allergic predisposition A positive history of allergy , asthma or untoward reaction during previous similar investigations indicates a need for extra caution since , as with other contrast media , this product may provoke anaphylaxis or other manifestations of allergy with nausea , vomiting , dyspnoea , erythema , urticaria and hypotension .
The benefits should clearly outweigh the risks in such patients and appropriate resuscitative measures should be immediately available .
The primary treatments are as follows : Effect Major Symptoms Primary Treatmen Vasomotor effect warmth nausea / vomiting reassurance Cutaneous scattered hives severe urticaria H1 - antihistamines H2 - antihistamines Bronchospastic wheezing oxygen Beta - 2 - agonist inhalers Anaphylactoid angioedema oxygen reaction urticaria bronchospasm hypotension iv fluids adrenergics ( iv epinephrine ) Inhaled beta - 2 - adrenergics antihistamines ( H1 - and H2 - blockers ) corticosteroids Hypotensive hypotension iv fluids Vagal reaction hypotension bradycardia iv fluids iv atropine From : Bush WH ; The Contrast Media Manual ; Katzburg RW Ed . ; Williams and Wilkins ; Baltimore 1992 ; Chapter 2 p 23 The risk of bronchospasm - inducing reactions in asthmatic patients is higher after contrast media administration , especially in patients taking beta - blockers .
Hypersensitivity testing In patients with suspected or known hypersensitivity to contrast media , sensitivity test doses are not recommended , as severe or fatal reactions to contrast media are not predictable from sensitivity test .
Myelomatosis or paraproteinaemias are conditions predisposing to renal impairment following CM administration .
The benefits of the use of a contrast - enhanced procedure should be carefully weighted against the possible risk .
Adequate hydration and monitoring of renal function are recommended after CM administration .
Cardiovascular diseases Care should be taken in severe cardiac disease particularly heart failure and coronary artery disease .
Reactions may include pulmonary oedema , haemodynamic changes , ischaemic ECG changes and arrhythmias .
In severe , chronic hypertension the risk of renal damage following administration of a contrast medium is increased .
In these cases the risks associated with the catheterization procedure are increased .
The product should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism or goitre .
Use may interfere with thyroid function tests .
The administration of iodinated contrast media may aggravate myasthenia signs and symptoms .
CNS Disorders Particular care is needed in patients with acute cerebral infarction , acute intracranial haemorrhage and any conditions involving damage to the blood brain barrier , brain oedema or acute demyelination .
Convulsive seizures are more likely in patients with intracranial tumours or metastases or with a history of epilepsy .
Neurological symptoms related to cerebrovascular diseases , intracranial tumours / metastases or degenerative or inflammatory pathologies may be exacerbated .
There is an increased risk of transient neurological complications in patients with symptomatic cerebrovascular disease eg stroke , transient ischaemic attacks .
Cerebral ischaemic phenomena may be caused by intravascular injection .
Anticonvulsant therapy should not be discontinued .
In acute and chronic alcoholism the increase in blood brain barrier permeability facilitates the passage of the contrast medium into cerebral tissue possibly leading to CMS disorders .
There is a possibility of a reduced seizure threshold in alcoholics .
In patients with a drug addiction there is also the possibility of a reduced seizure threshold .
Patients with phaeochromocytoma may develop severe , occasionally uncontrollable hypertensive crises during intra - arterial administration .
Premedication with an alpha and beta receptor blocker is recommended in these patients .
Pronounced excitement , anxiety and pain can cause side effects or intensify reaction to the contrast medium .
A sedative may be given .
Renal impairment In patients with moderate to severe impairment of renal function , attention should be paid to renal function parameters before re - examining the patient with a contrast media .
Preventive measures include : • identification of high - risk patients ; • ensuring adequate hydration before CM administration , preferably by maintaining i . v . infusion before and during the procedure and until the CM has been cleared by the kidneys ; avoiding whenever possible , the administration of nephrotoxic drugs or major surgery or procedure such as renal angioplasty , until the CM has been cleared ; A combination of severe hepatic and renal impairment delays excretion of the contrast medium therefore such patients should not be examined unless absolutely necessary .
Diabetes mellitus Care should be taken in renal impairment and diabetes .
In these patients it is important to maintain hydration in order to minimise deterioration in renal function .
The presence of renal damage in diabetic patients is one of the factors predisposing to renal impairment following contrast media administration .
This may precipitate lactic acidosis in patients who are taking metformin ( see section 4 . 5 - Interaction with medicaments and other forms of interaction ) .
Children : Infants up to 1 year , especially the newborn , are particularly susceptible to electrolyte imbalance and haemodynamic alterations .
Care should be taken regarding the dosage used .
Transient hypothyroidism may occur in neonates when the mother or the neonate has received an iodinated contrast agent .
Thyroid function tests ( usually TSH and T4 ) are recommended in neonates 7 - 10 days and 1 month after exposure to Iomeron especially in preterm neonates .
Elderly : There is special risk of reactions involving the circulatory system such that myocardial ischaemia , major arrhythmias and extrasystoles are more likely to occur .
A combination of neurological disturbances and vascular pathologies present a serious complication .
The probability of acute renal insufficiencies is higher in these people .
Precautions for dedicated exams Angiography Non ionic contrast media have less antiocoagulant activity in vitro than ionic media .
Meticulous attention should therefore be paid to angiographic technique .
Non ionic media should not be allowed to remain in contact with blood in a syringe , and intravascular catheters should be flushed frequently to minimise the risk of clotting which , rarely , has led to serious thromboembolic complications .
Intravascular administration should be performed if possible with the patient lying down .
The patient should be kept in this position and closely observed for at least 30 minutes after the procedure since the majority of severe incidents occur with this time .
Venography Special care is required when venography is performed in patients with thrombosis , phlebitis , severe ischaemic disease , local infection or a totally obstructed artero - venous system .
4 . 5 Interaction with other medicaments and other forms of interaction Use of the product may interfere with tests for thyroid function .
Vasopressor agents should not be administered prior to iomeprol .
Treatment with drugs that lower the seizure threshold such as certain neuroleptics ( MAO inhibitors , tricyclic antidepressants ) , analeptics , and anti - emetics and phenotiazine derivatives should be discontinued 48 hours before the examination .
Treatment should not be resumed until 24 hours post - procedure .
It has been reported that cardiac and / or hypertensive patients under treatment with diuretics , ACE - inhibitors , and / or beta blocking agents are at higher risk of adverse reactions when administered iodinated contrast media .
Beta - blockers may impair the response to treatment of bronchospasm induced by contrast medium .
Patients with normal renal function can continue to take metformin normally .
In diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy , under treatment with metformin and with moderate renal impairment , metformin should be stopped at the time of , or prior to the procedure and withheld for 48 hours subsequent to the procedure and reinstituted only after renal function has been re - evaluated and found to be normal In emergency patients in whom renal function is either impaired or unknown , the physician shall weigh out risk and benefit of an examination with a contrast medium and take precautions .
Metformin should be stopped from time of contrast medium administration .
After the procedure the patient should be monitored for signs of lactic acidosis .
Metformin should be restarted 48 hours after contrast medium if serum creatinine / eGFR is unchanged from the pre - imaging level .
Allergy - like reactions to contrast media are more frequent and may manifest as delayed reactions in patients treated with immuno - modulators , like Interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) .
4 . 6 Fertility , pregnancy and lactation Women of childbearing potential Appropriate investigations and measures should be taken when exposing women of child - bearing potential to any X - ray examination , whether with or without contrast medium .
Pregnancy Animal studies have not indicated any harmful effects with respect to the course of pregnancy or on the health of the unborn or neonate .
The safety of iomeprol in human pregnancy however has not been established .
Therefore avoid in pregnancy unless there is no safer alternative .
Since , wherever possible , exposure to radiation should be avoided during pregnancy , the benefits of any X ray examination , whether with or without contrast material , should for this reason alone be carefully weighed against the possible risk Breastfeeding No human data exist concerning the excretion of iomeprol in breast milk .
Animal studies have demonstrated that the excretion of iomeprol in breast milk is similar to that of other contrast agents and that these compounds are only minimally absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract of the young .
Adverse effects on the nursing infant are therefore unlikely to occur .
Stopping breastfeeding is unnecessary .
4 . 7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines There is no known effect on the ability to drive and operate machines .
4 . 8 Undesirable effects General The use of iodinated contrast media may cause untoward side effects .
They are usually mild to moderate and transient in nature .
However , severe and life - threatening reactions sometimes leading to death have been reported .
In most cases , reactions occur within minutes of dosing but at times reactions may occur at later time .
Anaphylaxis ( anaphylactoid / hypersensitivity reactions ) may manifest with various symptoms , and rarely does any one patient develop all the symptoms .
Typically , in 1 to 15 min ( but rarely after as long as 2 h ) , the patient complains of feeling abnormal , agitation , flushing , feeling hot , sweating increased , dizziness , increased lacrimation , rhinitis , palpitations , paresthesia , pruritus , sore throat and throat tightness , dysphagia , cough , sneezing , urticaria , erythema , mild localised oedema , angioneurotic oedema and dyspnoea due to glottic / laryngeal / pharyngeal oedema and / or spasm manifesting with wheezing , and bronchospasm .
Nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , and diarrhoea are also reported .
These reactions , which can occur independently of the dose administered or the route of administration , may represent the first signs of circulatory collapse .
Administration of the contrast medium must be discontinued immediately and , if needed , appropriate specific treatment urgently initiated via venous access .
Severe reactions involving the cardiovascular system , such as vasodilatation , with pronounced hypotension , tachycardia , dyspnoea , agitation , cyanosis and loss of consciousness progressing to respiratory and / or cardiac arrest may result in death .
These events can occur rapidly and require full and aggressive cardio - pulmonary resuscitation .
Primary circulatory collapse can occur as the only and / or initial presentation without respiratory symptoms or without other signs or symptoms outlined above .
The adverse reactions reported in clinical trials among 4 , 903 adult patients and from post - marketing surveillance are represented in the tables below by frequency and classified by MedDRA system organ class .
Within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
4 . 8 . 1 Intravascular administration Adult patients involved in clinical trials with intravascular administration of Iomeprol were 4 , 515 .
* Since the reactions were not observed during clinical trials with 4515 patients , best estimate is that their relative occurrence is rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 , 000 to < 1 / 1000 ) .
The most appropriate MedDRA term is used to describe a certain reaction and its symptoms and related conditions .
** Injection site reactions comprise injection site pain and swelling .
In the majority of cases they are due to extravasation of contrast medium .
These reactions are usually transient and result in recovery without sequelae .
Cases of extravasation with inflammation , skin necrosis and even development of compartment syndrome have been reported .
Adults System Organ Class Adverse Reactions Clinical Trials Post - marketing Surveillance Common ( ≥ 1 / 100 t o < 1 / 10 ) Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to < 1 / 100 ) Rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 , 000 to < 1 / 1000 ) Frequency unknown * Blood and lymphatic system disorders Thrombocytopenia , Haemolytic anaemia Immune system disorders Anaphylactoid reaction Psychiatric disorders Anxiety Confusional state Nervous system disorders Headache Dizziness Presyncope Coma Transient ischaemic attack Paralysis Syncope Convulsion Loss of consciousness Dysarthria Paraesthesia Amnesia Somnolence Taste abnormality Eye disorders Blindness transient Visual disturbance Conjunctivitis Lacrimation increased Photopsia Cardiac disorders Bradycardia Tachycardia Extrasystoles Cardiac arrest Myocardial infarction Cardiac failure Angina pectoris Arrhythmia Ventricular or atrial fibrillation Atrioventricular block Palpitations Cyanosis Vascular disorders Hypertension Hypotension Circulatory collapse or shock Hot flush Flushing Pallor Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders Dyspnoea Respiratory arrest Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) Pulmonary oedema Laryngeal oedema Pharyngeal oedema Bronchospasm Asthma Cough Hyperventilation Pharynx discomfort Laryngeal discomfort Rhinitis Dysphonia Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea Vomiting Diarrhoea Abdominal pain Salivary hypersecretion Dysphagia Salivary gland enlargement Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Erythema Urticaria Pruritus Rash Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis Angioedema Cold sweat Sweating increased Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder Back pain Arthralgia Renal and urinary disorders Renal failure General disorders and administration site conditions Feeling hot Chest pain Injection site warmth and pain Asthenia Rigors Pyrexia Injection site reaction ** Coldness local Fatigue Malaise Thirst Investigations Blood creatinine increased Electrocardiogram ST segment elevation Electrocardiogram abnormal Coronary artery thrombosis and coronary artery embolism have been reported as a complication of coronary catheterization procedures .
Vasospasm and consequent ischaemia have been observed during intra - arterial injections of contrast medium , in particular after coronary and cerebral angiography often procedurally related and possibly triggered by the tip of the catheter or excess catheter pressure .
As with other iodinated contrast media , very rare cases of mucocutaneous syndromes , including Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis ( Lyell syndrome ) and erythema multiforme , have been reported following the administration of Iomeprol injection .
Paediatric patients There is limited experience with paediatric patients .
The clinical trial paediatric safety database comprises 167 patients .
The Iomeprol safety profile is similar in children and adults .
4 . 8 . 2 Administration to body cavities After injection of an iodinated contrast media in body cavities , contrast media are slowly absorbed from the area of administration into the systemic circulation and subsequently cleared by renal elimination .
Blood amylase increased is common following ERCP .
Very rare cases of pancreatitis have been described .
The reactions reported in cases of arthrography and fistulography usually represent irritative manifestations superimposed on pre - existing conditions of tissue inflammation .
Hypersensitivity reactions are rare , generally mild and in the form of skin reactions .
However , the possibility of severe anaphylactoid reactions cannot be excluded .
As with other iodinated contrast media , pelvic pain and malaise may occur after hysterosalpingography .
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important .
It allows continued monitoring of the benefit / risk balance of the medicinal product .
Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the Yellow Card Scheme Website : www . mhra . gov . uk / yellowcard or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store .
4 . 9 Overdose The effects of overdose on the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems may become life - threatening .
Treatment consists of support of the vital functions and prompt use of symptomatic therapy .
Iomeprol does not bind to plasma or serum proteins and is therefore dialyzable .
5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5 . 1 Pharmacodynamic properties ATC code : V08AB10 Iomeprol is a low osmolality , non - ionic organic molecule with radio - opacity conferred by an iodine content of 49 % of the molecular weight .
It is formulated for use as an intravascular / intracavitary contrast medium in concentrations of up to 400 mg iodine per ml .
Even at this concentration the low viscosity allows delivery of high doses through thin catheters .
5 . 2 Pharmacokinetic properties The pharmacokinetics of intravascularly administered iomeprol are similar to those of other iodinated contrast media and conform to a two - compartment model with a rapid distribution and a slower elimination phase .
In healthy subjects , the mean distribution and elimination half - lives of iomeprol were 0 . 5 hours and 1 . 9 hours respectively .
Distribution volume is similar to that of extra cellular fluid .
There is no significant serum protein binding and iomeprol is not metabolized .
Elimination is almost exclusively through the kidneys ( 90 % of the dose recovered in the urine within 96 hours of its administration ) and is rapid ( 50 % of an intravascularly administered dose within 2 hours ) .
5 . 3 Preclinical Safety Data Pre - clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , toxicity to reproduction .
Results from studies in rats , mice and dogs demonstrate that iomeprol has an acute intravenous or intra - arterial toxicity similar to that of the other non ionic contrast media , as well as a good systemic tolerability after repeated intravenous administrations in rats and dogs .

4 . 3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients .
4 . 4 Special warnings and special precautions for use In consideration of possible complications , the patient should be kept under observation for at least 30 minutes after the examination .
Extreme caution during injection of contrast media is necessary to avoid extravasation .
A normal diet should be maintained until the patient refrains from eating 2 hours before the procedure .
Hydration Any severe disorders of water and electrolyte balance must be corrected prior to administration .
Adequate hydration must be ensured particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus , polyuria , oliguria and hyperuricaemia ; also in babies , small children and the elderly .
Rehydration prior to use of Iomeprol is recommended in patients with sickle cell disease .
Special population Hypersensitivity to iodinated contrast media , allergic predisposition A positive history of allergy , asthma or untoward reaction during previous similar investigations indicates a need for extra caution since , as with other contrast media , this product may provoke anaphylaxis or other manifestations of allergy with nausea , vomiting , dyspnoea , erythema , urticaria and hypotension .
The benefits should clearly outweigh the risks in such patients and appropriate resuscitative measures should be immediately available .
The primary treatments are as follows : Effect Major Symptoms Primary Treatment Vasomotor effect warmth nausea / vomiting reassurance Cutaneous scattered hives severe urticaria H1 - antihistamines H2 - antihistamines Bronchospastic wheezing oxygen Beta - 2 - agonist inhalers Anaphylactoid angioedema oxygen reaction urticaria bronchospasm hypotension iv fluids adrenergics ( iv epinephrine ) Inhaled beta - 2 - adrenergics antihistamines ( H1 - and H2 - blockers ) corticosteroids Hypotensive hypotension iv fluids Vagal reaction hypotension bradycardia iv fluids iv atropine From : Bush WH ; The Contrast Media Manual ; Katzburg RW Ed . ; Williams and Wilkins ; Baltimore 1992 ; Chapter 2 p 23 The risk of bronchospasm - inducing reactions in asthmatic patients is higher after contrast media administration , especially in patients taking beta - blockers .
Hypersensitivity testing In patients with suspected or known hypersensitivity to contrast media , sensitivity test doses are not recommended , as severe or fatal reactions to contrast media are not predictable from sensitivity test .
Myelomatosis or paraproteinaemias are conditions predisposing to renal impairment following CM administration .
The benefits of the use of a contrast - enhanced procedure should be carefully weighed against the possible risk .
Adequate hydration and monitoring of renal function are recommended after CM administration .
Cardiovascular diseases Care should be taken in patients with severe cardiac disease particularly heart failure and coronary artery disease .
Cardiac manifestations may include pulmonary oedema , haemodynamic changes , ischaemic ECG changes and arrhythmias .
In severe , chronic hypertension the risk of renal damage following administration of a contrast medium is increased .
The product should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism or goitre .
Use may interfere with thyroid function tests .
The administration of iodinated contrast media may aggravate myasthenia signs and symptoms .
CNS Disorders Particular care is needed in patients with acute cerebral infarction , acute intracranial haemorrhage and any conditions involving damage to the blood brain barrier , brain oedema or acute demyelination .
Convulsive seizures are more likely in patients with intracranial tumours or metastases or with a history of epilepsy .
Neurological symptoms related to cerebrovascular diseases , intracranial tumours / metastases or degenerative or inflammatory pathologies may be exacerbated .
There is an increased risk of transient neurological complications in patients with symptomatic cerebrovascular disease eg stroke , transient ischaemic attacks .
Cerebral ischaemic phenomena may be caused by intravascular injection .
Anticonvulsant therapy should not be discontinued .
In acute and chronic alcoholism the increase in blood brain barrier permeability facilitates the passage of the contrast medium into cerebral tissue possibly leading to CMS disorders .
There is a possibility of a reduced seizure threshold in alcoholics .
In patients with a drug addiction there is also the possibility of a reduced seizure threshold .
Patients with phaeochromocytoma may develop severe , occasionally uncontrollable hypertensive crises during intravascular administration .
Premedication with an alpha and beta receptor - blocker is recommended in these patients .
Pronounced excitement , anxiety and pain can cause side effects or intensify reaction to the contrast medium .
A sedative may be given .
Renal failure In patients with moderate to severe impairment of renal function , attention should be paid to renal function parameters , in particular before re - examining the patient with a contrast media .
Preventive measures include : • identification of high - risk patients ; • ensuring adequate hydration before CM administration , preferably by maintaining i . v . infusion before and during the procedure and until the CM has been cleared by the kidneys ; • avoiding whenever possible , the administration of nephrotoxic drugs or major surgery or procedure such as renal angioplasty , until the CM has been cleared ; A combination of severe hepatic and renal impairment delays excretion of the contrast medium therefore such patients should not be examined unless absolutely necessary .

Thyroid function tests ( usually TSH and T4 ) are recommended in neonates 7 - 10 days and 1 month after exposure to Iomeron especially in preterm neonates .
Elderly : The elderly are at special risk of reactions due to reduced physiological functions , especially when high dosage of contrast media is used .
A combination of neurological disturbances and vascular pathologies present a serious complication .
The probability of acute renal insufficiencies is higher in these people .
Intravascular administration should be performed if possible with the patient lying down .
The patient should be kept in this position and closely observed for at least 30 minutes after the procedure since the majority of severe incidents occur with this time .
4 . 5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Use of the product may interfere with tests for thyroid function .
Vasopressor agents should not be administered prior to Iomeprol .
Treatment with drugs that lower the seizure threshold such as certain neuroleptics ( MAO inhibitors , tricyclic antidepressants ) , analeptics , and anti - emetics and phenothiazine derivatives should be discontinued 48 hours before the examination .
Treatment should not be resumed until 24 hours post - procedure .
It has been reported that cardiac and / or hypertensive patients under treatment with diuretics , ACE - inhibitors , and / or beta blocking agents are at higher risk of adverse reactions when administered iodinated contrast media .
Beta - blockers may impair the response to treatment of bronchospasm induced by contrast medium .

Metformin should be stopped from time of contrast medium administration .
After the procedure the patient should be monitored for signs of lactic acidosis .
Metformin should be restarted 48 hours after contrast medium if serum creatinine / eGFR is unchanged from the pre - imaging level .
Allergy - like reactions to contrast media are more frequent and may manifest as delayed reactions in patients treated with immuno - modulators , like Interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) .

4 . 3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients .
4 . 4 Special warnings and special precautions for use In consideration of possible complications , the patient should be kept under observation for at least 30 minutes after the examination .
Extreme caution during injection of contrast media is necessary to avoid extravasation .
A normal diet should be maintained until the patient refrains from eating 2 hours before the procedure .
Hydration Any severe disorders of water and electrolyte balance must be corrected prior to administration .
Adequate hydration must be ensured particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus , polyuria , oliguria and hyperuricaemia ; also in babies , small children and the elderly .
Rehydration prior to use of Iomeprol is recommended in patients with sickle cell disease .
Special population Hypersensitivity to iodinated contrast media , allergic predisposition A positive history of allergy , asthma or untoward reaction during previous similar investigations indicates a need for extra caution since , as with other contrast media , this product may provoke anaphylaxis or other manifestations of allergy with nausea , vomiting , dyspnoea , erythema , urticaria and hypotension .
The benefits should clearly outweigh the risks in such patients and appropriate resuscitative measures should be immediately available .
The primary treatments are as follows : Effect Major Symptoms Primary Treatment Vasomotor effect warmth nausea / vomiting reassurance Cutaneous scattered hives severe urticaria H1 - antihistamines H2 - antihistamines Bronchospastic wheezing oxygen Beta - 2 - agonist inhalers Anaphylactoid angioedema oxygen reaction urticaria bronchospasm hypotension iv fluids adrenergics ( iv epinephrine ) Inhaled beta - 2 - adrenergics antihistamines ( H1 - and H2 - blockers ) corticosteroids Hypotensive hypotension iv fluids Vagal reaction hypotension bradycardia iv fluids iv atropine From : Bush WH ; The Contrast Media Manual ; Katzburg RW Ed . ; Williams and Wilkins ; Baltimore 1992 ; Chapter 2 p 23 The risk of bronchospasm - inducing reactions in asthmatic patients is higher after contrast media administration , especially in patients taking beta - blockers .
Hypersensitivity testing In patients with suspected or known hypersensitivity to contrast media , sensitivity test doses are not recommended , as severe or fatal reactions to contrast media are not predictable from sensitivity test .
Myelomatosis or paraproteinaemias are conditions predisposing to renal impairment following CM administration .
The benefits of the use of a contrast - enhanced procedure should be carefully weighed against the possible risk .
Adequate hydration and monitoring of renal function are recommended after CM administration .
Cardiovascular diseases Care should be taken in patients with severe cardiac disease particularly heart failure and coronary artery disease .
Cardiac manifestations may include pulmonary oedema , haemodynamic changes , ischaemic ECG changes and arrhythmias .
In severe , chronic hypertension the risk of renal damage following administration of a contrast medium is increased .
The product should be used with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism or goitre .
Use may interfere with thyroid function tests .
The administration of iodinated contrast media may aggravate myasthenia signs and symptoms .
CNS Disorders Particular care is needed in patients with acute cerebral infarction , acute intracranial haemorrhage and any conditions involving damage to the blood brain barrier , brain oedema or acute demyelination .
Convulsive seizures are more likely in patients with intracranial tumours or metastases or with a history of epilepsy .
Neurological symptoms related to cerebrovascular diseases , intracranial tumours / metastases or degenerative or inflammatory pathologies may be exacerbated .
There is an increased risk of transient neurological complications in patients with symptomatic cerebrovascular disease eg stroke , transient ischaemic attacks .
Cerebral ischaemic phenomena may be caused by intravascular injection .
Anticonvulsant therapy should not be discontinued .
In acute and chronic alcoholism the increase in blood brain barrier permeability facilitates the passage of contrast medium into cerebral tissue possibly leading to CNS disorders .
There is a possibility of a reduced seizure threshold in alcoholics .
In patients with a drug addiction there is also the possibility of a reduced seizure threshold .
Patients with phaeochromocytoma may develop severe , occasionally uncontrollable hypertensive crises during intravascular administration .
Premedication with an alpha and beta receptor - blocker is recommended in these patients .
Pronounced excitement , anxiety and pain can cause side effects or intensify reaction to the contrast medium .
A sedative may be given .
Renal failure In patients with moderate to severe impairment of renal function , attention should be paid to renal function parameters , before re - examining the patient with a contrast media .
Preventive measures include : • identification of high - risk patients ; • ensuring adequate hydration before CM administration , preferably by maintaining i . v . infusion before and during the procedure and until the CM has been cleared by the kidneys ; • avoiding whenever possible , the administration of nephrotoxic drugs or major surgery or procedure such as renal angioplasty , until the CM has been cleared ; A combination of severe hepatic and renal impairment delays excretion of the contrast medium therefore such patients should not be examined unless absolutely necessary .
Diabetes mellitus Care should be taken in renal impairment and diabetes .
In these patients it is important to maintain hydration in order to minimise deterioration in renal function .
The presence of renal damage in diabetic patients is one of the factors predisposing to renal impairment following contrast media administration .
This may precipitate lactic acidosis in patients who are taking metformin ( see section 4 . 5 - Interaction with medicaments and other forms of interaction ) .
Children : Infants up to 1 year , especially the new - born , are particularly susceptible to electrolyte imbalance and haemodynamic alterations .
Care should be taken regarding the dosage used .
Transient hypothyroidism may occur in neonates when the mother or the neonate has received an iodinated contrast agent .
Thyroid function tests ( usually TSH and T4 ) are recommended in neonates 7 - 10 days and 1 month after exposure to Iomeron especially in preterm neonates .
Elderly : The elderly are at special risk of reactions due to reduced physiological functions , especially when high dosage of contrast media is used .
A combination of neurological disturbances and vascular pathologies present a serious complication .
The probability of acute renal insufficiencies is higher in these people .
Intravascular administration should be performed if possible with the patient lying down .
The patient should be kept in this position and closely observed for at least 30 minutes after the procedure since the majority of severe incidents occur with this time .
4 . 5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Use of the product may interfere with tests for thyroid function .
Vasopressor agents should not be administered prior to Iomeprol .
Treatment with drugs that lower the seizure threshold such as certain neuroleptics ( MAO inhibitors , tricyclic antidepressants ) , analeptics , and anti - emetics and phenothiazine derivatives should be discontinued 48 hours before the examination .
Treatment should not be resumed until 24 hours post - procedure .
It has been reported that cardiac and / or hypertensive patients under treatment with diuretics , ACE - inhibitors , and / or beta blocking agents are at higher risk of adverse reactions when administered iodinated contrast media .
Beta - blockers may impair the response to treatment of bronchospasm induced by contrast medium .
Patients with normal renal function can continue to take metformin normally .
In diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy , under treatment with metformin and with moderate renal impairment , metformin should be stopped at the time of , or prior to the procedure and withheld for 48 hours subsequent to the procedure and reinstituted only after renal function has been re - evaluated and found to be normal In emergency patients in whom renal function is either impaired or unknown , the physician shall weigh out risk and benefit of an examination with a contrast medium and take precautions .
Metformin should be stopped from time of contrast medium administration .
After the procedure the patient should be monitored for signs of lactic acidosis .
Metformin should be restarted 48 hours after contrast medium if serum creatinine / eGFR is unchanged from the pre - imaging level .
Allergy - like reactions to contrast media are more frequent and may manifest as delayed reactions in patients treated with immuno - modulators , like Interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) .
4 . 6 Fertility , pregnancy and lactation Women of childbearing potential Appropriate investigations and measures should be taken when exposing women of child - bearing potential to any X - ray examination , whether with or without contrast medium .
Pregnancy Animal studies have not indicated any harmful effects with respect to the course of pregnancy or on the health of the unborn or neonate .
The safety of Iomeprol in human pregnancy however has not been established .
Therefore avoid in pregnancy unless there is no safer alternative .
Since , wherever possible , exposure to radiation should be avoided during pregnancy , the benefits of any X ray examination , whether with or without contrast material , should for this reason alone be carefully weighed against the possible risk .
Breastfeeding No human data exist concerning the excretion of Iomeprol in breast milk .
Animal studies have demonstrated that the excretion of Iomeprol in breast milk is similar to that of other contrast agents and that these compounds are only minimally absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract of the young .
Adverse effects on the nursing infant are therefore unlikely to occur .
Stopping breastfeeding is unnecessary .
4 . 7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines There is no known effect on the ability to drive and operate machines .
4 . 8 Undesirable effects General The use of iodinated contrast media may cause untoward side effects .
They are usually mild to moderate and transient in nature .
However , severe and life - threatening reactions sometimes leading to death have been reported .
In most cases , reactions occur within minutes of dosing but at times reactions may occur at later time .
Anaphylaxis ( anaphylactoid / hypersensitivity reactions ) may manifest with various symptoms , and rarely does any one patient develop all the symptoms .
Typically , in 1 to 15 min ( but rarely after as long as 2 h ) , the patient complains of feeling abnormal , agitation , flushing , feeling hot , sweating increased , dizziness , increased lacrimation , rhinitis , palpitations , paresthesia , pruritus , sore throat and throat tightness , dysphagia , cough , sneezing , urticaria , erythema , mild localised oedema , angioneurotic oedema and dyspnoea due to glottic / laryngeal / pharyngeal oedema and / or spasm manifesting with wheezing , and bronchospasm .
Nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , and diarrhoea are also reported .
These reactions , which can occur independently of the dose administered or the route of administration , may represent the first signs of circulatory collapse .
Administration of the contrast medium must be discontinued immediately and , if needed , appropriate specific treatment urgently initiated via venous access .
Severe reactions involving the cardiovascular system , such as vasodilatation , with pronounced hypotension , tachycardia , dyspnoea , agitation , cyanosis and loss of consciousness progressing to respiratory and / or cardiac arrest may result in death .
These events can occur rapidly and require full and aggressive cardio - pulmonary resuscitation .
Primary circulatory collapse can occur as the only and / or initial presentation without respiratory symptoms or without other signs or symptoms outlined above .
The adverse reactions reported in clinical trials among 4 , 903 adult patients and from post - marketing surveillance are represented in the tables below by frequency and classified by MedDRA system organ class .
Within each frequency grouping , adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness .
Adult patients involved in clinical trials with intravascular administration of Iomeprol were 4 , 515 .
* Since the reactions were not observed during clinical trials with 4515 patients , best estimate is that their relative occurrence is rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 , 000 to < 1 / 1000 ) .
The most appropriate MedDRA term is used to describe a certain reaction and its symptoms and related conditions .
** Injection site reactions comprise injection site pain and swelling .
In the majority of cases they are due to extravasation of contrast medium .
These reactions are usually transient and result in recovery without sequelae .
Cases of extravasation with inflammation , skin necrosis and even development of compartment syndrome have been reported .
Adults System Organ Class Adverse Reactions Clinical Trials Post - marketing Surveillance Common ( ≥ 1 / 100 t o < 1 / 10 ) Uncommon ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to < 1 / 100 ) Rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 , 000 to < 1 / 1000 ) Frequency unknown * Blood and lymphatic system disorders Thrombocytopenia , Haemolytic anaemia Immune system disorders Anaphylactoid reaction Psychiatric disorders Anxiety Confusional state Nervous system disorders Headache Dizziness Presyncope Coma Transient ischaemic attack Paralysis Syncope Convulsion Loss of consciousness Dysarthria Paraesthesia Amnesia Somnolence Taste abnormality Eye disorders Blindness transient Visual disturbance Conjunctivitis Lacrimation increased Photopsia Cardiac disorders Bradycardia Tachycardia Cardiac arrest Myocardial infarction Cardiac failure Angina pectoris Arrhythmia Ventricular or atrial fibrillation Atrioventricular block Extrasystoles Palpitations Cyanosis Vascular disorders Hypertension Hypotension Circulatory collapse or shock Hot flush Flushing Pallor Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders Dyspnoea Respiratory arrest Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) Pulmonary oedema Laryngeal oedema Pharyngeal oedema Bronchospasm Asthma Cough Hyperventilation Pharynx discomfort Laryngeal discomfort Rhinitis Dysphonia Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea Vomiting Diarrhoea Abdominal pain Salivary hypersecretion Dysphagia Salivary gland enlargement Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Erythema Urticaria Pruritus Rash Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis Angioedema Cold sweat Sweating increased Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorder Back pain Arthralgia Renal and urinary disorders Renal failure General disorders and administration site conditions Feeling hot Chest pain Injection site warmth and pain Asthenia Rigors Pyrexia Injection site reaction ** Coldness local Fatigue Malaise Thirst Investigations Blood creatinine increased Electrocardiogram ST segment elevation Electrocardiogram abnormal As with other iodinated contrast media , very rare cases of mucocutaneous syndromes , including Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis ( Lyell syndrome ) and erythema multiforme , have been reported following the administration of Iomeprol injection .
Paediatric patients There is limited experience with paediatric patients .
The clinical trial paediatric safety database comprises 167 patients .

4 . 9 Overdose The effects of overdose on the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems may become life - threatening .
Treatment consists of support of the vital functions and prompt use of symptomatic therapy .
Iomeprol does not bind to plasma or serum proteins and is therefore dialyzable .
5 PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5 . 1 Pharmacodynamic properties ATC code : V08AB10 Iomeprol is a low osmolality , non - ionic organic molecule with radio - opacity conferred by an iodine content of 49 % of the molecular weight .
It is formulated for use as an intravascular / intracavitary / intrathecal contrast medium in concentrations of up to 400 mg iodine per ml .
Even at this concentration the low viscosity allows delivery of high doses through thin catheters .
5 . 2 Pharmacokinetic properties The pharmacokinetics of intravascularly administered Iomeprol are similar to those of other iodinated contrast media and conform to a two - compartment model with a rapid distribution and a slower elimination phase .
In healthy subjects , the mean distribution and elimination half - lives of Iomeprol were 0 . 5 hours and 1 . 9 hours respectively .
Distribution volume is similar to that of extra cellular fluid .
There is no significant serum protein binding and Iomeprol is not metabolized .
Elimination is almost exclusively through the kidneys ( 90 % of the dose recovered in the urine within 96 hours of its administration ) and is rapid ( 50 % of an intravascularly administered dose within 2 hours ) .
5 . 3 Preclinical Safety Data Pre - clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology , repeated dose toxicity , genotoxicity , toxicity to reproduction .
Results from studies in rats , mice and dogs demonstrate that Iomeprol has an acute intravenous or intra - arterial toxicity similar to that of the other non ionic contrast media , as well as a good systemic tolerability after repeated intravenous administrations in rats and dogs .
