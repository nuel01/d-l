Lenalidomide , a thalidomide analogue , caused limb abnormalities in a developmental monkey study .
Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes severe life - threatening human birth defects .
If lenalidomide is used during pregnancy , it may cause birth defects or embryo - fetal death .
In females of reproductive potential , obtain 2 negative pregnancy tests before starting lenalidomide treatment .
Females of reproductive potential must use 2 forms of contraception or continuously abstain from heterosexual sex during and for 4 weeks after lenalidomide treatment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Medication Guide ( 17 ) ] .
To avoid embryo - fetal exposure to lenalidomide , lenalidomide capsules are only available through a restricted distribution program , the Lenalidomide REMS program ( 5 . 2 ) .
Information about the Lenalidomide REMS program is available at www . lenalidomiderems . com or by calling the toll - free number 1 ‑ 888 ‑ 423 ‑ 5436 .
Hematologic Toxicity ( Neutropenia and Thrombocytopenia ) Lenalidomide can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia .
Eighty percent of patients with del 5 q myelodysplastic syndromes had to have a dose delay / reduction during the major study .
Thirty - four percent of patients had to have a second dose delay / reduction .
Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity was seen in 80 % of patients enrolled in the study .
Patients on therapy for del 5 q myelodysplastic syndromes should have their complete blood counts monitored weekly for the first 8 weeks of therapy and at least monthly thereafter .
Patients may require dose interruption and / or reduction .
Patients may require use of blood product support and / or growth factors [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism Lenalidomide has demonstrated a significantly increased risk of deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) and pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , as well as risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with multiple myeloma who were treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone therapy .
Monitor for and advise patients about signs and symptoms of thromboembolism .
Advise patients to seek immediate medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath , chest pain , or arm or leg swelling .
Thromboprophylaxis is recommended and the choice of regimen should be based on an assessment of the patient ’ s underlying risks [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Pregnancy ( Boxed Warning , 4 . 1 , 5 . 1 , 8 . 1 ) .
• Demonstrated severe hypersensitivity to lenalidomide ( 4 . 2 , 5 . 9 , 5 . 15 ) .
4 . 1 Pregnancy Lenalidomide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female .
Limb abnormalities were seen in the offspring of monkeys that were dosed with lenalidomide during organogenesis .
This effect was seen at all doses tested .
Due to the results of this developmental monkey study , and lenalidomide ’ s structural similarities to thalidomide , a known human teratogen , lenalidomide is contraindicated in females who are pregnant [ see Boxed Warning ] .
If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) , ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
4 . 2 Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions Lenalidomide capsules are contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated severe hypersensitivity ( e . g . , angioedema , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis ) to lenalidomide [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 , 5 . 15 ) ] .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Increased Mortality : serious and fatal cardiac adverse reactions occurred in patients with CLL treated with lenalidomide capsules ( 5 . 5 ) .
• Second Primary Malignancies ( SPM ) : Higher incidences of SPM were observed in controlled trials of patients with MM receiving lenalidomide capsules ( 5 . 6 ) .
• Increased Mortality : Observed in patients with MM when pembrolizumab was added to dexamethasone and a thalidomide analogue ( 5 . 7 ) .
• Hepatotoxicity : Hepatic failure including fatalities ; monitor liver function .
Stop lenalidomide capsules and evaluate if hepatotoxicity is suspected ( 5 . 8 ) .
• Severe Cutaneous Reactions : Discontinue lenalidomide capsules for severe reactions ( 5 . 9 ) .
• Tumor lysis syndrome ( TLS ) including fatalities : Monitor patients at risk of TLS ( i . e . , those with high tumor burden ) and take appropriate precautions ( 5 . 10 ) .
• Tumor flare reaction : Serious tumor flare reactions , including fatal reactions , have occurred during investigational use of lenalidomide capsules for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma ( 5 . 11 ) .
• Impaired Stem Cell mobilization : A decrease in the number of CD34 + cells collected after treatment ( > 4 cycles ) with lenalidomide has been reported .
Consider early referral to transplant center ( 5 . 12 ) .
• Early mortality in MCL : Higher rate of early deaths have occurred in patients with MCL ( 5 . 14 ) .
• Hypersensitivity : Monitor patients for potential hypersensitivity .
Discontinue lenalidomide capsules for angioedema and anaphylaxis ( 5 . 15 ) .
5 . 1 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Lenalidomide is a thalidomide analogue and is contraindicated for use during pregnancy .
Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes life - threatening human birth defects or embryo - fetal death [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
An embryo - fetal development study in monkeys indicates that lenalidomide produced malformations in the offspring of female monkeys who received the drug during pregnancy , similar to birth defects observed in humans following exposure to thalidomide during pregnancy .
Lenalidomide capsules are only available through the Lenalidomide REMS program [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Females of Reproductive Potential Females of reproductive potential must avoid pregnancy for at least 4 weeks before beginning lenalidomide therapy , during therapy , during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy .
Females must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control , beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with lenalidomide , during therapy , during dose interruptions and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of lenalidomide therapy .
Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating therapy .
The first test should be performed within 10 to 14 days and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide therapy and then weekly during the first month , then monthly thereafter in females with regular menstrual cycles or every 2 weeks in females with irregular menstrual cycles [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
Males Lenalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug .
Therefore , males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking lenalidomide capsules and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing lenalidomide capsules , even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy .
Male patients taking lenalidomide capsules must not donate sperm and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing lenalidomide capsules [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
Blood Donation Patients must not donate blood during treatment with lenalidomide capsules and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to lenalidomide .
5 . 2 Lenalidomide REMS Program Because of the embryo - fetal risk [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] , lenalidomide capsules are available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS ) , the Lenalidomide REMS program .
Required components of the Lenalidomide REMS program include the following : • Prescribers must be certified with the Lenalidomide REMS program by enrolling and complying with the REMS requirements .
• Patients must sign a Patient - Physician agreement form and comply with the REMS requirements .
In particular , female patients of reproductive potential who are not pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] and males must comply with contraception requirements [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
• Pharmacies must be certified with the Lenalidomide REMS program , must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive lenalidomide capsules and comply with REMS requirements .
Further information about the Lenalidomide REMS program is available at www . lenalidomiderems . com or by telephone at 1 - 888 - 423 - 5436 .
5 . 3 Hematologic Toxicity Lenalidomide can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia .
Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection .
Advise patients to observe for bleeding or bruising , especially with use of concomitant medication that may increase risk of bleeding .
Patients taking lenalidomide capsules should have their complete blood counts assessed periodically as described below [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 ) ] .
Monitor complete blood counts ( CBC ) in patients taking lenalidomide capsules in combination with dexamethasone or as lenalidomide maintenance therapy for MM every 7 days ( weekly ) for the first 2 cycles , on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 3 , and every 28 days ( 4 weeks ) thereafter .
A dose interruption and / or dose reduction may be required [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
In the MM maintenance therapy trials , Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was reported in up to 59 % of lenalidomide - treated patients and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia in up to 38 % of lenalidomide - treated patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor complete blood counts ( CBC ) in patients taking lenalidomide capsules for MDS weekly for the first 8 weeks and at least monthly thereafter .
Grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity was seen in 80 % of patients enrolled in the MDS study .
In the 48 % of patients who developed Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia , the median time to onset was 42 days ( range , 14 to 411 days ) , and the median time to documented recovery was 17 days ( range , 2 to 170 days ) .
In the 54 % of patients who developed Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia , the median time to onset was 28 days ( range , 8 to 290 days ) , and the median time to documented recovery was 22 days ( range , 5 to 224 days ) [ see Boxed Warning and Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Monitor complete blood counts ( CBC ) in patients taking lenalidomide capsules for MCL weekly for the first cycle ( 28 days ) , every 2 weeks during cycles 2 to 4 , and then monthly thereafter .
Patients may require dose interruption and / or dose reduction .
In the MCL trial , Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was reported in 43 % of the patients .
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 28 % of the patients .
Monitor complete blood counts ( CBC ) in patients taking lenalidomide capsules for FL or MZL weekly for the first 3 weeks of Cycle 1 ( 28 days ) , every 2 weeks during Cycles 2 to 4 , and then monthly thereafter .
Patients may require dose interruption and / or dose reduction .
In the AUGMENT and MAGNIFY trials , Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was reported in 50 % and 33 % , respectively , of patients in the lenalidomide / rituximab arm .
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was reported in 2 % and 8 % , respectively , of patients in the lenalidomide / rituximab arm [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 4 Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism Venous thromboembolic events ( VTE [ DVT and PE ] ) and arterial thromboembolic events ( ATE , myocardial infarction and stroke ) are increased in patients treated with lenalidomide .
A significantly increased risk of DVT ( 7 . 4 % ) and of PE ( 3 . 7 % ) occurred in patients with MM after at least one prior therapy who were treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone therapy compared to patients treated in the placebo and dexamethasone group ( 3 . 1 % and 0 . 9 % ) in clinical trials with varying use of anticoagulant therapies .
In the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma ( NDMM ) study in which nearly all patients received antithrombotic prophylaxis , DVT was reported as a serious adverse reaction ( 3 . 6 % , 2 % , and 1 . 7 % ) in the Rd Continuous , Rd18 , and MPT Arms , respectively .
The frequency of serious adverse reactions of PE was similar between the Rd Continuous , Rd18 , and MPT Arms ( 3 . 8 % , 2 . 8 % , and 3 . 7 % , respectively ) [ see Boxed Warning and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Myocardial infarction ( 1 . 7 % ) and stroke ( CVA ) ( 2 . 3 % ) are increased in patients with MM after at least one prior therapy who were treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone therapy compared to patients treated with placebo and dexamethasone ( 0 . 6 % , and 0 . 9 % ) in clinical trials .
In the NDMM study , myocardial infarction ( including acute ) was reported as a serious adverse reaction ( 2 . 3 % , 0 . 6 % , and 1 . 1 % ) in the Rd Continuous , Rd18 , and MPT Arms , respectively .
The frequency of serious adverse reactions of CVA was similar between the Rd Continuous , Rd18 , and MPT Arms ( 0 . 8 % , 0 . 6 % , and 0 . 6 % , respectively ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Patients with known risk factors , including prior thrombosis , may be at greater risk and actions should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable factors ( e . g . hyperlipidemia , hypertension , smoking ) .
In controlled clinical trials that did not use concomitant thromboprophylaxis , 21 . 5 % overall thrombotic events ( Standardized MedDRA Query Embolic and Thrombotic events ) occurred in patients with refractory and relapsed MM who were treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone compared to 8 . 3 % thrombosis in patients treated with placebo and dexamethasone .
The median time to first thrombosis event was 2 . 8 months .
In the NDMM study in which nearly all patients received antithrombotic prophylaxis , the overall frequency of thrombotic events was 17 . 4 % in patients in the combined Rd Continuous and Rd18 Arms , and was 11 . 6 % in the MPT Arm .
The median time to first thrombosis event was 4 . 3 months in the combined Rd Continuous and Rd18 Arms .
In the AUGMENT trial , the incidence of VTE ( including DVT and PE ) in FL or MZL patients was 3 . 4 % in the lenalidomide / rituximab arm [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In the AUGMENT trial , the incidence of ATE ( including MI ) in FL or MZL patients was 0 . 6 % in the lenalidomide / rituximab arm [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Thromboprophylaxis is recommended .
The regimen of thromboprophylaxis should be based on an assessment of the patient ’ s underlying risks .
Instruct patients to report immediately any signs and symptoms suggestive of thrombotic events .
ESAs and estrogens may further increase the risk of thrombosis and their use should be based on a benefit - risk decision in patients receiving lenalidomide [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 5 Increased Mortality in Patients with CLL In a prospective randomized ( 1 : 1 ) clinical trial in the first line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia , single agent lenalidomide therapy increased the risk of death as compared to single agent chlorambucil .
In an interim analysis , there were 34 deaths among 210 patients on the lenalidomide treatment arm compared to 18 deaths among 211 patients in the chlorambucil treatment arm , and hazard ratio for overall survival was 1 . 92 [ 95 % CI : 1 . 08 to 3 . 41 ] , consistent with a 92 % increase in the risk of death .
The trial was halted for safety in July 2013 .
Serious adverse cardiovascular reactions , including atrial fibrillation , myocardial infarction , and cardiac failure occurred more frequently in the lenalidomide treatment arm .
Lenalidomide capsules are not indicated and not recommended for use in CLL outside of controlled clinical trials .
5 . 6 Second Primary Malignancies In clinical trials in patients with MM receiving lenalidomide , an increase of hematologic plus solid tumor second primary malignancies ( SPM ) notably AML and MDS have been observed .
An increase in hematologic SPM including AML and MDS occurred in 5 . 3 % of patients with NDMM receiving lenalidomide in combination with oral melphalan compared with 1 . 3 % of patients receiving melphalan without lenalidomide .
The frequency of AML and MDS cases in patients with NDMM treated with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone without melphalan was 0 . 4 % .
In patients receiving lenalidomide maintenance therapy following high dose intravenous melphalan and auto - HSCT , hematologic SPM occurred in 7 . 5 % of patients compared to 3 . 3 % in patients receiving placebo .
The incidence of hematologic plus solid tumor ( excluding squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma ) SPM was 14 . 9 % , compared to 8 . 8 % in patients receiving placebo with a median follow - up of 91 . 5 months .
Non - melanoma skin cancer SPM , including squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma , occurred in 3 . 9 % of patients receiving lenalidomide maintenance , compared to 2 . 6 % in the placebo arm .
In patients with relapsed or refractory MM treated with lenalidomide / dexamethasone , the incidence of hematologic plus solid tumor ( excluding squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma ) SPM was 2 . 3 % versus 0 . 6 % in the dexamethasone alone arm .
Non - melanoma skin cancer SPM , including squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma , occurred in 3 . 1 % of patients receiving lenalidomide / dexamethasone , compared to 0 . 6 % in the dexamethasone alone arm .
Patients who received lenalidomide - containing therapy until disease progression did not show a higher incidence of invasive SPM than patients treated in the fixed duration lenalidomide - containing arms .
Monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies .
Take into account both the potential benefit of lenalidomide and the risk of second primary malignancies when considering treatment with lenalidomide .
In the AUGMENT trial with FL or MZL patients receiving lenalidomide / rituximab therapy , hematologic plus solid tumor SPMs , notably AML , have been observed .
In the AUGMENT trial , hematologic SPM of AML occurred in 0 . 6 % of patients with FL or MZL receiving lenalidomide / rituximab therapy .
The incidence of hematologic plus solid tumor SPMs ( excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers ) was 1 . 7 % in the lenalidomide / rituximab arm with a median follow - up of 29 . 8 months ( range 0 . 5 to 51 . 3 months ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies .
Take into account both the potential benefit of lenalidomide and the risk of second primary malignancies when considering treatment with lenalidomide .
5 . 7 Increased Mortality in Patients with MM When Pembrolizumab Is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone In two randomized clinical trials in patients with MM , the addition of pembrolizumab to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone , a use for which no PD - 1 or PD - L1 blocking antibody is indicated , resulted in increased mortality .
Treatment of patients with MM with a PD - 1 or PD - L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials .
5 . 8 Hepatotoxicity Hepatic failure , including fatal cases , has occurred in patients treated with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone .
In clinical trials , 15 % of patients experienced hepatotoxicity ( with hepatocellular , cholestatic and mixed characteristics ) ; 2 % of patients with MM and 1 % of patients with myelodysplasia had serious hepatotoxicity events .
The mechanism of drug - induced hepatotoxicity is unknown .
Pre - existing viral liver disease , elevated baseline liver enzymes , and concomitant medications may be risk factors .
Monitor liver enzymes periodically .
Stop lenalidomide capsules upon elevation of liver enzymes .
After return to baseline values , treatment at a lower dose may be considered .
5 . 9 Severe Cutaneous Reactions Severe cutaneous reactions including Stevens - Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) , toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) have been reported .
DRESS may present with a cutaneous reaction ( such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis ) , eosinophilia , fever , and / or lymphadenopathy with systemic complications such as hepatitis , nephritis , pneumonitis , myocarditis , and / or pericarditis .
These events can be fatal .
Patients with a prior history of Grade 4 rash associated with thalidomide treatment should not receive lenalidomide capsules .
Consider lenalidomide capsules interruption or discontinuation for Grade 2 - 3 skin rash .
Permanently discontinue lenalidomide capsules for Grade 4 rash , exfoliative or bullous rash , or for other severe cutaneous reactions such as SJS , TEN or DRESS [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
5 . 10 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Fatal instances of tumor lysis syndrome ( TLS ) have been reported during treatment with lenalidomide .
The patients at risk of TLS are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment .
Monitor patients at risk closely and take appropriate preventive approaches .
In the AUGMENT trial in FL or MZL patients , TLS occurred in 2 patients ( 1 . 1 % ) in the lenalidomide / rituximab arm .
TLS occurred in 1 patient ( 0 . 5 % ) in the MAGNIFY trial during the lenalidomide / rituximab induction period ; the event was a serious , Grade 3 adverse reaction .
5 . 11 Tumor Flare Reaction Tumor flare reaction ( TFR ) , including fatal reactions , have occurred during investigational use of lenalidomide for CLL and lymphoma , and is characterized by tender lymph node swelling , low grade fever , pain and rash .
Lenalidomide capsules are not indicated and not recommended for use in CLL outside of controlled clinical trials .
Monitoring and evaluation for TFR is recommended in patients with MCL , FL , or MZL .
Tumor flare reaction may mimic progression of disease ( PD ) .
In the MCL trial , 13 / 134 ( 10 % ) of subjects experienced TFR ; all reports were Grade 1 or 2 in severity .
All of the events occurred in Cycle 1 and one patient developed TFR again in Cycle 11 .
In the AUGMENT trial in FL or MZL patients , TFR was reported in 19 / 176 ( 10 . 8 % ) of patients in lenalidomide with rituximab arm ; one patient in the lenalidomide / rituximab arm experienced a Grade 3 TFR .
In the MAGNIFY trial , 9 / 222 ( 4 . 1 % ) of patients experienced TFR ; all reports were Grade 1 or 2 in severity and 1 event was considered as serious .
In a separate MCL phase 2 trial , one case of TFR resulted in a fatal outcome .
Lenalidomide capsules may be continued in patients with Grade 1 and 2 TFR without interruption or modification , at the physician ’ s discretion .
Patients with Grade 1 and 2 TFR may also be treated with corticosteroids , non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) and / or narcotic analgesics for management of TFR symptoms .
In patients with Grade 3 or 4 TFR , it is recommended to withhold treatment with lenalidomide until TFR resolves to ≤ Grade 1 .
Patients with Grade 3 or 4 TFR may be treated for management of symptoms per the guidance for treatment of Grade 1 and 2 TFR .
5 . 12 Impaired Stem Cell Mobilization A decrease in the number of CD34 + cells collected after treatment ( > 4 cycles ) with lenalidomide has been reported .
In patients who are auto - HSCT candidates , referral to a transplant center should occur early in treatment to optimize the timing of the stem cell collection .
In patients who received more than 4 cycles of a lenalidomide - containing treatment or for whom inadequate numbers of CD 34 + cells have been collected with G - CSF alone , G - CSF with cyclophosphamide or the combination of G - CSF with a CXCR4 inhibitor may be considered .
5 . 13 Thyroid Disorders Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have been reported [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Measure thyroid function before start of lenalidomide treatment and during therapy .
5 . 14 Early Mortality in Patients with MCL In another MCL study , there was an increase in early deaths ( within 20 weeks ) , 12 . 9 % in the lenalidomide arm versus 7 . 1 % in the control arm .
On exploratory multivariate analysis , risk factors for early deaths include high tumor burden , MIPI score at diagnosis , and high WBC at baseline ( ≥ 10 x 109 / L ) .
5 . 15 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity , including angioedema , anaphylaxis , and anaphylactic reactions to lenalidomide has been reported .
Permanently discontinue lenalidomide capsules for angioedema and anaphylaxis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Newly Diagnosed MM – Lenalidomide Combination Therapy : Data were evaluated from 1 , 613 patients in a large phase 3 study who received at least one dose of lenalidomide with low dose dexamethasone ( Rd ) given for 2 different durations of time ( i . e . , until progressive disease [ Arm Rd Continuous ; N = 532 ] or for up to eighteen 28 - day cycles [ 72 weeks , Arm Rd18 ; N = 540 ] or who received melphalan , prednisone and thalidomide ( Arm MPT ; N = 541 ) for a maximum of twelve 42 - day cycles ( 72 weeks ) .
The median treatment duration in the Rd Continuous arm was 80 . 2 weeks ( range 0 . 7 to 246 . 7 ) or 18 . 4 months ( range 0 . 16 to 56 . 7 ) .
In general , the most frequently reported adverse reactions were comparable in Arm Rd Continuous and Arm Rd18 , and included diarrhea , anemia , constipation , peripheral edema , neutropenia , fatigue , back pain , nausea , asthenia , and insomnia .
The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 reactions included neutropenia , anemia , thrombocytopenia , pneumonia , asthenia , fatigue , back pain , hypokalemia , rash , cataract , lymphopenia , dyspnea , DVT , hyperglycemia , and leukopenia .
The highest frequency of infections occurred in Arm Rd Continuous ( 75 % ) compared to Arm MPT ( 56 % ) .
There were more grade 3 and 4 and serious adverse reactions of infection in Arm Rd Continuous than either Arm MPT or Rd18 .
In the Rd Continuous arm , the most common adverse reactions leading to dose interruption of lenalidomide were infection events ( 28 . 8 % ) ; overall , the median time to the first dose interruption of lenalidomide was 7 weeks .
The most common adverse reactions leading to dose reduction of lenalidomide in the Rd Continuous arm were hematologic events ( 10 . 7 % ) ; overall , the median time to the first dose reduction of lenalidomide was 16 weeks .
In the Rd Continuous arm , the most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of lenalidomide were infection events ( 3 . 4 % ) .
In both Rd arms , the frequencies of onset of adverse reactions were generally highest in the first 6 months of treatment and then the frequencies decreased over time or remained stable throughout treatment , except for cataracts .
The frequency of onset of cataracts increased over time with 0 . 7 % during the first 6 months and up to 9 . 6 % by the 2 nd year of treatment with Rd Continuous .
Table 4 summarizes the adverse reactions reported for the Rd Continuous , Rd18 , and MPT treatment arms .

* Adverse reactions included in combined adverse reaction terms : Abdominal Pain : Abdominal pain , abdominal pain upper , abdominal pain lower , gastrointestinal pain Pneumonias : Pneumonia , lobar pneumonia , pneumonia pneumococcal , bronchopneumonia , pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia , pneumonia legionella , pneumonia staphylococcal , pneumonia klebsiella , atypical pneumonia , pneumonia bacterial , pneumonia escherichia , pneumonia streptococcal , pneumonia viral Sepsis : Sepsis , septic shock , urosepsis , escherichia sepsis , neutropenic sepsis , pneumococcal sepsis , staphylococcal sepsis , bacterial sepsis , meningococcal sepsis , enterococcal sepsis , klebsiella sepsis , pseudomonal sepsis Rash : Rash , rash pruritic , rash erythematous , rash maculo - papular , rash generalized , rash papular , exfoliative rash , rash follicular , rash macular , drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms , erythema multiforme , rash pustular Deep Vein Thrombosis : Deep vein thrombosis , venous thrombosis limb , venous thrombosis Newly Diagnosed MM - Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy Following Auto - HSCT : Data were evaluated from 1 , 018 patients in two randomized trials who received at least one dose of lenalidomide 10 mg daily as maintenance therapy after auto - HSCT until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity .
The mean treatment duration for lenalidomide treatment was 30 . 3 months for Maintenance Study 1 and 24 months for Maintenance Study 2 ( overall range across both studies from 0 . 1 to 108 months ) .
As of the cut - off date of 1 Mar 2015 , 48 patients ( 21 % ) in the Maintenance Study 1 lenalidomide arm were still on treatment and none of the patients in the Maintenance Study 2 lenalidomide arm were still on treatment at the same cut - off date .
The adverse reactions listed from Maintenance Study 1 included events reported post - transplant ( completion of high - dose melphalan / auto - HSCT ) , and the maintenance treatment period .
In Maintenance Study 2 , the adverse reactions were from the maintenance treatment period only .
In general , the most frequently reported adverse reactions ( more than 20 % in the lenalidomide arm ) across both studies were neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , leukopenia , anemia , upper respiratory tract infection , bronchitis , nasopharyngitis , cough , gastroenteritis , diarrhea , rash , fatigue , asthenia , muscle spasm and pyrexia .
The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 reactions ( more than 20 % in the lenalidomide arm ) included neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , and leukopenia .
The serious adverse reactions lung infection and neutropenia ( more than 4 . 5 % ) occurred in the lenalidomide arm .
For lenalidomide , the most common adverse reactions leading to dose interruption were hematologic events ( 29 . 7 % , data available in Maintenance Study 2 only ) .
The most common adverse reaction leading to dose reduction of lenalidomide were hematologic events ( 17 . 7 % , data available in Maintenance Study 2 only ) .
The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of lenalidomide were thrombocytopenia ( 2 . 7 % ) in Maintenance Study 1 and neutropenia ( 2 . 4 % ) in Maintenance Study 2 .
The frequencies of onset of adverse reactions were generally highest in the first 6 months of treatment and then the frequencies decreased over time or remained stable throughout treatment .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse drug reactions have been identified from the worldwide post - marketing experience with lenalidomide .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure [ see Warnings and Precautions Section ( 5 . 8 to 5 . 11 and 5 . 13 ) ] .
Endocrine disorders : Hypothyroidism , hyperthyroidism Hepatobiliary disorders : Hepatic failure ( including fatality ) , toxic hepatitis , cytolytic hepatitis , cholestatic hepatitis , mixed cytolytic / cholestatic hepatitis , transient abnormal liver laboratory tests Immune system disorders : Angioedema , anaphylaxis , acute graft - versus - host disease ( following allogeneic hematopoietic transplant ) , solid organ transplant rejection Infections and infestations : Viral reactivation ( such as hepatitis B virus and herpes zoster ) , progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) Neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( including cysts and polyps ) : Tumor lysis syndrome , tumor flare reaction Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders : Pneumonitis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Stevens - Johnson Syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis , drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Digoxin : Monitor digoxin plasma levels periodically due to increased Cmax and AUC with concomitant lenalidomide therapy ( 7 . 1 ) .
• Concomitant use of erythropoietin stimulating agents or estrogen containing therapies with lenalidomide may increase the risk of thrombosis ( 7 . 2 ) .
7 . 1 Digoxin When digoxin was co - administered with multiple doses of lenalidomide ( 10 mg / day ) the digoxin Cmax and AUCinf were increased by 14 % .
Periodically monitor digoxin plasma levels , in accordance with clinical judgment and based on standard clinical practice in patients receiving this medication , during administration of lenalidomide capsules .
7 . 2 Concomitant Therapies That May Increase the Risk of Thrombosis Erythropoietic agents , or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis , such as estrogen containing therapies , should be used with caution after making a benefit - risk assessment in patients receiving lenalidomide capsules [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
7 . 3 Warfarin Co - administration of multiple doses of lenalidomide ( 10 mg / day ) with a single dose of warfarin ( 25 mg ) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide or R - and S - warfarin .
Expected changes in laboratory assessments of PT and INR were observed after warfarin administration , but these changes were not affected by concomitant lenalidomide administration .
It is not known whether there is an interaction between dexamethasone and warfarin .
Close monitoring of PT and INR is recommended in patients with MM taking concomitant warfarin .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in females exposed to lenalidomide during pregnancy as well as female partners of male patients who are exposed to lenalidomide .
This registry is also used to understand the root cause for the pregnancy .
Report any suspected fetal exposure to lenalidomide to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 and also to REMS Call Center at 1 - 888 - 423 - 5436 .
Risk Summary Based on the mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] and findings from animal studies [ see Data ] , lenalidomide can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy [ see Boxed Warning , Contraindications ( 4 . 1 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Lenalidomide is a thalidomide analogue .
Thalidomide is a human teratogen , inducing a high frequency of severe and life - threatening birth defects such as amelia ( absence of limbs ) , phocomelia ( short limbs ) , hypoplasticity of the bones , absence of bones , external ear abnormalities ( including anotia , micropinna , small or absent external auditory canals ) , facial palsy , eye abnormalities ( anophthalmos , microphthalmos ) , and congenital heart defects .
Alimentary tract , urinary tract , and genital malformations have also been documented and mortality at or shortly after birth has been reported in about 40 % of infants .
Lenalidomide caused thalidomide - type limb defects in monkey offspring .
Lenalidomide crossed the placenta after administration to pregnant rabbits and pregnant rats [ see Data ] .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus .
If pregnancy does occur during treatment , immediately discontinue the drug .
Under these conditions , refer patient to an obstetrician / gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling .
Report any suspected fetal exposure to lenalidomide to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 and also to REMS Call Center at 1 - 888 - 423 - 5436 .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
The estimated background risk in the U . S . general population of major birth defects is 2 % to 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 % to 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
Data Animal data In an embryo - fetal developmental toxicity study in monkeys , teratogenicity , including thalidomide - like limb defects , occurred in offspring when pregnant monkeys received oral lenalidomide during organogenesis .
Exposure ( AUC ) in monkeys at the lowest dose was 0 . 17 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 25 mg .
Similar studies in pregnant rabbits and rats at 20 times and 200 times the MRHD respectively , produced embryo lethality in rabbits and no adverse reproductive effects in rats .
In a pre - and post - natal development study in rats , animals received lenalidomide from organogenesis through lactation .
The study revealed a few adverse effects on the offspring of female rats treated with lenalidomide at doses up to 500 mg / kg ( approximately 200 times the human dose of 25 mg based on body surface area ) .
The male offspring exhibited slightly delayed sexual maturation and the female offspring had slightly lower body weight gains during gestation when bred to male offspring .
As with thalidomide , the rat model may not adequately address the full spectrum of potential human embryo - fetal developmental effects for lenalidomide .
Following daily oral administration of lenalidomide from Gestation Day 7 through Gestation Day 20 in pregnant rabbits , fetal plasma lenalidomide concentrations were approximately 20 to 40 % of the maternal Cmax .
Following a single oral dose to pregnant rats , lenalidomide was detected in fetal plasma and tissues ; concentrations of radioactivity in fetal tissues were generally lower than those in maternal tissues .
These data indicated that lenalidomide crossed the placenta .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of lenalidomide in human milk , the effects of lenalidomide on the breastfed child , or the effects of lenalidomide on milk production .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed children from lenalidomide , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with lenalidomide .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Lenalidomide can cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating lenalidomide therapy and during therapy .
Advise females of reproductive potential that they must avoid pregnancy 4 weeks before therapy , while taking lenalidomide capsules , during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy .
Females of reproductive potential must have 2 negative pregnancy tests before initiating lenalidomide .
The first test should be performed within 10 to 14 days , and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide capsules .
Once treatment has started and during dose interruptions , pregnancy testing for females of reproductive potential should occur weekly during the first 4 weeks of use , then pregnancy testing should be repeated every 4 weeks in females with regular menstrual cycles .
If menstrual cycles are irregular , the pregnancy testing should occur every 2 weeks .
Pregnancy testing and counseling should be performed if a patient misses her period or if there is any abnormality in her menstrual bleeding .
Lenalidomide treatment must be discontinued during this evaluation .
Contraception Females Females of reproductive potential must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control simultaneously : one highly effective form of contraception – tubal ligation , IUD , hormonal ( birth control pills , injections , hormonal patches , vaginal rings , or implants ) , or partner ’ s vasectomy , and 1 additional effective contraceptive method – male latex or synthetic condom , diaphragm , or cervical cap .
Contraception must begin 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with lenalidomide , during therapy , during dose interruptions , and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of lenalidomide therapy .
Reliable contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of infertility , unless due to hysterectomy .
Females of reproductive potential should be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods , if needed .
Males Lenalidomide is present in the semen of males who take lenalidomide capsules .
Therefore , males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking lenalidomide capsules and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing lenalidomide capsules , even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy .
Male patients taking lenalidomide capsules must not donate sperm and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing lenalidomide capsules .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use MM In Combination : Overall , of the 1 , 613 patients in the NDMM study who received study treatment , 94 % ( 1 , 521 / 1 , 613 ) were 65 years of age or older , while 35 % ( 561 / 1 , 613 ) were over 75 years of age .
The percentage of patients over age 75 was similar between study arms ( Rd Continuous : 33 % ; Rd18 : 34 % ; MPT : 33 % ) .

For other body systems ( e . g . , Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders , Infections and Infestations , Cardiac Disorders , Vascular Disorders ) , there was a less consistent trend for increased frequency of grade 3 / 4 adverse reactions in older vs younger subjects across all treatment arms Serious adverse reactions were generally reported at a higher frequency in the older subjects than in the younger subjects across all treatment arms .
MM Maintenance Therapy : Overall , 10 % ( 106 / 1 , 018 ) of patients were 65 years of age or older , while no patients were over 75 years of age .
Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were higher in the lenalidomide arm ( more than 5 % higher ) in the patients 65 years of age or older versus younger patients .
The frequency of Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions in the Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders were higher in the lenalidomide arm ( more than 5 % higher ) in the patients 65 years of age or older versus younger patients .
There were not a sufficient number of patients 65 years of age or older in lenalidomide maintenance studies who experienced either a serious adverse reaction , or discontinued therapy due to an adverse reaction to determine whether elderly patients respond relative to safety differently from younger patients .
MM After At Least One Prior Therapy : Of the 703 MM patients who received study treatment in Studies 1 and 2 , 45 % were age 65 or over while 12 % of patients were age 75 and over .
The percentage of patients age 65 or over was not significantly different between the lenalidomide / dexamethasone and placebo / dexamethasone groups .
Of the 353 patients who received lenalidomide / dexamethasone , 46 % were age 65 and over .
In both studies , patients > 65 years of age were more likely than patients ≤ 65 years of age to experience DVT , pulmonary embolism , atrial fibrillation , and renal failure following use of lenalidomide .
No differences in efficacy were observed between patients over 65 years of age and younger patients .
Of the 148 patients with del 5 q MDS enrolled in the major study , 38 % were age 65 and over , while 33 % were age 75 and over .
Although the overall frequency of adverse reactions ( 100 % ) was the same in patients over 65 years of age as in younger patients , the frequency of serious adverse reactions was higher in patients over 65 years of age than in younger patients ( 54 % vs . 33 % ) .
A greater proportion of patients over 65 years of age discontinued from the clinical studies because of adverse reactions than the proportion of younger patients ( 27 % vs . 16 % ) .
No differences in efficacy were observed between patients over 65 years of age and younger patients .
Of the 134 patients with MCL enrolled in the MCL trial , 63 % were age 65 and over , while 22 % of patients were age 75 and over .
The overall frequency of adverse reactions was similar in patients over 65 years of age and in younger patients ( 98 % vs . 100 % ) .
The overall incidence of grade 3 and 4 adverse reactions was also similar in these 2 patient groups ( 79 % vs . 78 % , respectively ) .
The frequency of serious adverse reactions was higher in patients over 65 years of age than in younger patients ( 55 % vs . 41 % ) .
No differences in efficacy were observed between patients over 65 years of age and younger patients .
FL or MZL in Combination : Overall , 48 % ( 282 / 590 ) of patients were 65 years of age or older , while 14 % ( 82 / 590 ) of patients were over 75 years of age .
The overall frequency of adverse reactions was similar in patients 65 years of age or older and younger patients for both studies pooled ( 98 % ) .
Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were higher in the lenalidomide arm ( more than 5 % higher ) in the patients 65 years of age or older versus younger patients ( 71 % versus 59 % ) .
The frequency of Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were higher in the lenalidomide arm ( more than 5 % higher ) in the patients 65 years of age or older versus younger patients in the Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders ( 47 % versus 40 % ) and Infections and Infestations ( 16 % versus 11 % ) .
Serious adverse reactions were higher in the lenalidomide arm ( more than 5 % higher ) in the patients 65 years of age or older versus younger patients ( 37 % versus 18 % ) .
The frequency of serious adverse reactions were higher in the lenalidomide arm ( more than 5 % higher ) in the patients 65 years of age or older versus younger patients in Infections and Infestations ( 15 % versus 6 % ) .
Since elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection .
Monitor renal function .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Adjust the starting dose of lenalidomide based on the creatinine clearance value and for patients on dialysis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no specific experience in the management of lenalidomide overdose in patients with MM , MDS , MCL , FL or MZL .
In dose - ranging studies in healthy subjects , some were exposed to up to 200 mg ( administered 100 mg BID ) and in single - dose studies , some subjects were exposed to up to 400 mg .
Pruritus , urticaria , rash , and elevated liver transaminases were the primary reported AEs .
In clinical trials , the dose - limiting toxicity was neutropenia and thrombocytopenia .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Lenalidomide is an analogue of thalidomide with immunomodulatory , antiangiogenic , and antineoplastic properties .
Cellular activities of lenalidomide are mediated through its target cereblon , a component of a cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme complex .
In vitro , in the presence of drug , substrate proteins ( including Aiolos , Ikaros , and CK1α ) are targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation leading to direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects .
Lenalidomide inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of certain hematopoietic tumor cells including MM , mantle cell lymphoma , and del ( 5 q ) myelodysplastic syndromes , follicular lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma in vitro .
Lenalidomide causes a delay in tumor growth in some in vivo nonclinical hematopoietic tumor models including MM .
Immunomodulatory properties of lenalidomide include increased number and activation of T cells and natural killer ( NK ) cells leading to direct and enhanced antibody - dependent cell - mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) via increased secretion of interleukin - 2 and interferon - gamma , increased numbers of NKT cells , and inhibition of pro - inflammatory cytokines ( e . g . , TNF - α and IL - 6 ) by monocytes .
In MM cells , the combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone synergizes the inhibition of cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis .
The combination of lenalidomide and rituximab increases ADCC and direct tumor apoptosis in follicular lymphoma cells and increases ADCC in marginal zone lymphoma cells compared to rituximab alone in vitro .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of lenalidomide on the QTc interval was evaluated in 60 healthy male subjects in a thorough QT study .
At a dose two times the maximum recommended dose , lenalidomide did not prolong the QTc interval .
The largest upper bound of the two - sided 90 % CI for the mean differences between lenalidomide and placebo was below 10 ms . 12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following single and multiple doses of lenalidomide in patients with MM or MDS , the maximum plasma concentrations occurred between 0 . 5 and 6 hours post - dose .
The single and multiple dose pharmacokinetic disposition of lenalidomide is linear with AUC and Cmax values increasing proportionally with dose .
Multiple doses of lenalidomide at the recommended dosage does not result in drug accumulation .
Administration of a single 25 mg dose of lenalidomide with a high - fat meal in healthy subjects reduces the extent of absorption , with an approximate 20 % decrease in AUC and 50 % decrease in Cmax .
In the trials where the efficacy and safety were established for lenalidomide , the drug was administered without regard to food intake .
Lenalidomide capsules can be administered with or without food .
The oral absorption rate of lenalidomide in patients with MCL is similar to that observed in patients with MM or MDS .
Distribution In vitro ( 14 C ) - lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins is approximately 30 % .
Lenalidomide is present in semen at 2 hours ( 1 , 379 ng / ejaculate ) and 24 hours ( 35 ng / ejaculate ) after the administration of lenalidomide capsules 25 mg daily .
Elimination The mean half - life of lenalidomide is 3 hours in healthy subjects and 3 to 5 hours in patients with MM , MDS , or MCL .
Metabolism Lenalidomide - undergoes limited metabolism .
Unchanged lenalidomide is the predominant circulating component in humans .
Two identified metabolites are 5 - hydroxy - lenalidomide and N - acetyl - lenalidomide ; each constitutes less than 5 % of parent levels in circulation .
Excretion Elimination is primarily renal .
Following a single oral administration of [ 14 C ] - lenalidomide 25 mg to healthy subjects , approximately 90 % and 4 % of the radioactive dose was eliminated within ten days in urine and feces , respectively .
Approximately 82 % of the radioactive dose was excreted as lenalidomide in the urine within 24 hours .
Hydroxy - lenalidomide and N - acetyl - lenalidomide represented 4 . 6 % and 1 . 8 % of the excreted dose , respectively .
The renal clearance of lenalidomide exceeds the glomerular filtration rate .
Specific Populations Renal Impairment : Eight subjects with mild renal impairment ( creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) 50 to 79 mL / min calculated using Cockcroft - Gault ) , 9 subjects with moderate renal impairment ( CLcr 30 to 49 mL / min ) , 4 subjects with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) , and 6 patients with end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) requiring dialysis were administered a single 25 mg dose of lenalidomide .
Three healthy subjects of similar age with normal renal function ( CLcr > 80 mL / min ) were also administered a single 25 mg dose of lenalidomide .
As CLcr decreased , half - life increased and drug clearance decreased linearly .
Patients with moderate and severe impairment had a 3 - fold increase in half - life and a 66 % to 75 % decrease in drug clearance compared to healthy subjects .
Patients on hemodialysis ( n = 6 ) had an approximate 4 . 5 - fold increase in half - life and an 80 % decrease in drug clearance compared to healthy subjects .
Approximately 30 % of the drug in body was removed during a 4 - hour hemodialysis session .
Adjust the starting dose of lenalidomide in patients with renal impairment based on the CLcr value [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
Hepatic Impairment : Mild hepatic impairment ( defined as total bilirubin > 1 to 1 . 5 times upper limit normal ( ULN ) or any aspartate transaminase greater than ULN ) did not influence the disposition of lenalidomide .
No pharmacokinetic data is available for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment .
Other Intrinsic Factors : Age ( 39 to 85 years ) , body weight ( 33 to 135 kg ) , sex , race , and type of hematological malignancies ( MM , MDS or MCL ) did not have a clinically relevant effect on lenalidomide clearance in adult patients .
Drug Interactions Co - administration of a single dose or multiple doses of dexamethasone ( 40 mg ) had no clinically relevant effect on the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide ( 25 mg ) .
Co - administration of lenalidomide ( 25 mg ) after multiple doses of a P - gp inhibitor such as quinidine ( 600 mg twice daily ) did not significantly increase the Cmax or AUC of lenalidomide .
Co - administration of the P - gp inhibitor and substrate temsirolimus ( 25 mg ) , with lenalidomide ( 25 mg ) did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide , temsirolimus , or sirolimus ( metabolite of temsirolimus ) .
In vitro studies demonstrated that lenalidomide is a substrate of P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) .
Lenalidomide is not a substrate of human breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) , multidrug resistance protein ( MRP ) transporters MRP1 , MRP2 , or MRP3 , organic anion transporters ( OAT ) OAT1 and OAT3 , organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 ( OATP1B1 ) , organic cation transporters ( OCT ) OCT1 and OCT2 , multidrug and toxin extrusion protein ( MATE ) MATE1 , and organic cation transporters novel ( OCTN ) OCTN1 and OCTN2 .
Lenalidomide is not an inhibitor of P - gp , bile salt export pump ( BSEP ) , BCRP , MRP2 , OAT1 , OAT3 , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , or OCT2 .
Lenalidomide does not inhibit or induce CYP450 isoenzymes .
Also , lenalidomide does not inhibit bilirubin glucuronidation formation in human liver microsomes with UGT1A1 genotyped as UGT1A1 * 1 / * 1 , UGT1A1 * 1 / * 28 , and UGT1A1 * 28 / * 28 .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with lenalidomide have not been conducted .
Lenalidomide was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay ( Ames test ) and did not induce chromosome aberrations in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes , or mutations at the thymidine kinase ( tk ) locus of mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells .
Lenalidomide did not increase morphological transformation in Syrian Hamster Embryo assay or induce micronuclei in the polychromatic erythrocytes of the bone marrow of male rats .
A fertility and early embryonic development study in rats , with administration of lenalidomide up to 500 mg / kg ( approximately 200 times the human dose of 25 mg , based on body surface area ) produced no parental toxicity and no adverse effects on fertility .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Multiple Myeloma Randomized , Open - Label Clinical Trial in Patients with Newly Diagnosed MM : A randomized multicenter , open - label , 3 - arm trial of 1 , 623 patients , was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide and low - dose dexamethasone ( Rd ) given for 2 different durations of time to that of melphalan , prednisone and thalidomide ( MPT ) in newly diagnosed MM patients who were not a candidate for stem cell transplant .
In the first arm of the study , Rd was given continuously until progressive disease [ Arm Rd Continuous ] .
In the second arm , Rd was given for up to eighteen 28 - day cycles [ 72 weeks , Arm Rd18 ] ) .
In the third arm , melphalan , prednisone and thalidomide ( MPT ) was given for a maximum of twelve 42 - day cycles ( 72 weeks ) .
For the purposes of this study , a patient who was < 65 years of age was not a candidate for SCT if the patient refused to undergo SCT therapy or the patient did not have access to SCT due to cost or other reasons .
Patients were stratified at randomization by age ( ≤ 75 versus > 75 years ) , stage ( ISS Stages I and II versus Stage III ) , and country .
Patients in the Rd Continuous and Rd18 arms received lenalidomide 25 mg once daily on Days 1 to 21 of 28 - day cycles .
Dexamethasone was dosed 40 mg once daily on Days 1 , 8 , 15 , and 22 of each 28 - day cycle .
For patients over > 75 years old , the starting dose of dexamethasone was 20 mg orally once daily on days 1 , 8 , 15 , and 22 of repeated 28 - day cycles .
Initial dose and regimens for Rd Continuous and Rd18 were adjusted according to age and renal function .
All patients received prophylactic anticoagulation with the most commonly used being aspirin .
The demographics and disease - related baseline characteristics of the patients were balanced among the 3 arms .
In general , study subjects had advanced - stage disease .
Of the total study population , the median age was 73 in the 3 arms with 35 % of total patients > 75 years of age ; 59 % had ISS Stage I / II ; 41 % had ISS stage III ; 9 % had severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance [ CLcr ] < 30 mL / min ) ; 23 % had moderate renal impairment ( CLcr > 30 to 50 mL / min ; 44 % had mild renal impairment ( CLcr > 50 to 80 mL / min ) .
For ECOG Performance Status , 29 % were Grade 0 , 49 % Grade 1 , 21 % Grade 2 , 0 . 4 % ≥ Grade 3 .
The primary efficacy endpoint , progression - free survival ( PFS ) , was defined as the time from randomization to the first documentation of disease progression as determined by Independent Response Adjudication Committee ( IRAC ) , based on International Myeloma Working Group [ IMWG ] criteria or death due to any cause , whichever occurred first during the study until the end of the PFS follow - up phase .
For the efficacy analysis of all endpoints , the primary comparison was between Rd Continuous and MPT arms .
The efficacy results are summarized in the table below .
PFS was significantly longer with Rd Continuous than MPT : HR 0 . 72 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 61 - 0 . 85 p < 0 . 0001 ) .
A lower percentage of subjects in the Rd Continuous arm compared with the MPT arm had PFS events ( 52 % versus 61 % , respectively ) .
The improvement in median PFS time in the Rd Continuous arm compared with the MPT arm was 4 . 3 months .
The myeloma response rate was higher with Rd Continuous compared with MPT ( 75 . 1 % versus 62 . 3 % ) ; with a complete response in 15 . 1 % of Rd Continuous arm patients versus 9 . 3 % in the MPT arm .
The median time to firstresponse was 1 . 8 months in the Rd Continuous arm versus 2 . 8 months in the MPT arm .
For the interim OS analysis with 03 March 2014 data cutoff , the median follow - up time for all surviving patients is 45 . 5 months , with 697 death events , representing 78 % of prespecified events required for the planned final OS analysis ( 697 / 896 of the final OS events ) .
The observed OS HR was 0 . 75 for Rd Continuous versus MPT ( 95 % CI = 0 . 62 , 0 . 90 ) .

Randomized , Placebo - Controlled Clinical Trials - Maintenance Following Auto - HSCT : Two multicenter , randomized , double - blind , parallel group , placebo - controlled studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide maintenance therapy in the treatment of MM patients after auto - HSCT .
In Maintenance Study 1 , patients between 18 and 70 years of age who had undergone induction therapy followed by auto - HSCT were eligible .
Induction therapy must have occurred within 12 months .
Within 90 to 100 days after auto - HSCT , patients with at least a stable disease response were randomized 1 : 1 to receive either lenalidomide or placebo maintenance .
In Maintenance Study 2 , patients aged < 65 years at diagnosis who had undergone induction therapy followed by auto - HSCT and had achieved at least a stable disease response at the time of hematologic recovery were eligible .
Within 6 months after auto - HSCT , patients were randomized 1 : 1 to receive either lenalidomide or placebo maintenance .
Patients eligible for both trials had to have CLcr ≥ 30 mL / minute .
In both studies , the lenalidomide maintenance dose was 10 mg once daily on days 1 to 28 of repeated 28 - day cycles , could be increased to 15 mg once daily after 3 months in the absence of dose - limiting toxicity , and treatment was to be continued until disease progression or patient withdrawal for another reason .
The dose was reduced , or treatment was temporarily interrupted or stopped , as needed to manage toxicity .
A dose increase to 15 mg once daily occurred in 135 patients ( 58 % ) in Maintenance Study 1 , and in 185 patients ( 60 % ) in Maintenance Study 2 .
The demographics and disease - related baseline characteristics of the patients were similar across the two studies and reflected a typical MM population after auto - HSCT ( see Table 14 ) .

The major efficacy endpoint of both studies was PFS defined from randomization to the date of progression or death , whichever occurred first ; the individual studies were not powered for an overall survival endpoint .
Both studies were unblinded upon the recommendations of their respective data monitoring committees and after surpassing the respective thresholds for preplanned interim analyses of PFS .
After unblinding , patients continued to be followed as before .
Patients in the placebo arm of Maintenance Study 1 were allowed to cross over to receive lenalidomide before disease progression ( 76 patients [ 33 % ] crossed over to lenalidomide ) ; patients in Maintenance Study 2 were not recommended to cross over .
The efficacy results are summarized in the following table .
In both studies , the primary analysis of PFS at unblinding was significantly longer with lenalidomide compared to placebo : Maintenance Study 1 HR 0 . 38 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 27 - 0 . 54 p < 0 . 001 ) and Maintenance Study 2 HR 0 . 50 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 39 - 0 . 64 p < 0 . 001 ) .
For both studies , PFS was updated with a cutoff date of 1 March 2015 as shown in the table and the following Kaplan Meier graphs .
With longer follow - up ( median 72 . 4 and 86 months , respectively ) , the updated PFS analyses for both studies continue to show a PFS advantage for lenalidomide compared to placebo : Maintenance Study 1 HR 0 . 38 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 28 - 0 . 50 ) with median PFS of 68 . 6 months and Maintenance Study 2 HR 0 . 53 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 44 - 0 . 64 ) with median PFS of 46 . 3 months .
Descriptive analysis of OS data with a cutoff date of 1 February 2016 are provided in Table 15 .
Median follow - up time was 81 . 6 and 96 . 7 months for Maintenance Study 1 and Maintenance Study 2 , respectively .
Median OS was 111 and 84 . 2 months for lenalidomide and placebo , respectively , for Maintenance Study 1 , and 105 . 9 and 88 . 1 months , for lenalidomide and placebo , respectively , for Maintenance Study 2 .

Randomized , Open - Label Clinical Studies in Patients with MM After At Least One Prior Therapy Two randomized studies ( Studies 1 and 2 ) were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide .
These multicenter , multinational , double - blind , placebo - controlled studies compared lenalidomide plus oral pulse high - dose dexamethasone therapy to dexamethasone therapy alone in patients with MM who had received at least one prior treatment .
These studies enrolled patients with absolute neutrophil counts ( ANC ) ≥ 1 , 000 / mm3 , platelet counts ≥ 75 , 000 / mm3 , serum creatinine ≤ 2 . 5 mg / dL , serum SGOT / AST or SGPT / ALT ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal ( ULN ) , and serum direct bilirubin ≤ 2 mg / dL .
In both studies , patients in the lenalidomide / dexamethasone group took 25 mg of lenalidomide orally once daily on Days 1 to 21 and a matching placebo capsule once daily on Days 22 to 28 of each 28 day cycle .
Patients in the placebo / dexamethasone group took 1 placebo capsule on Days 1 to 28 of each 28 day cycle .
Patients in both treatment groups took 40 mg of dexamethasone orally once daily on Days 1 to 4 , 9 to 12 , and 17 to 20 of each 28 day cycle for the first 4 cycles of therapy .
The dose of dexamethasone was reduced to 40 mg orally once daily on Days 1 to 4 of each 28 day cycle after the first 4 cycles of therapy .
In both studies , treatment was to continue until disease progression .
In both studies , dose adjustments were allowed based on clinical and laboratory findings .
Sequential dose reductions to 15 mg daily , 10 mg daily and 5 mg daily were allowed for toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Table 16 summarizes the baseline patient and disease characteristics in the two studies .
In both studies , baseline demographic and disease - related characteristics were comparable between the lenalidomide / dexamethasone and placebo / dexamethasone groups .

TTP was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of progressive disease .
Preplanned interim analyses of both studies showed that the combination of lenalidomide / dexamethasone was significantly superior to dexamethasone alone for TTP .
The studies were unblinded to allow patients in the placebo / dexamethasone group to receive treatment with the lenalidomide / dexamethasone combination .
For both studies , the extended follow - up survival data with crossovers were analyzed .
In study 1 , the median survival time was 39 . 4 months ( 95 % CI : 32 . 9 , 47 . 4 ) in lenalidomide / dexamethasone group and 31 . 6 months ( 95 % CI : 24 . 1 , 40 . 9 ) in placebo / dexamethasone group , with a hazard ratio of 0 . 79 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 61 to 1 . 03 ) .
In study 2 , the median survival time was 37 . 5 months ( 95 % CI : 29 . 9 , 46 . 6 ) in lenalidomide / dexamethasone group and 30 . 8 months ( 95 % CI : 23 . 5 , 40 . 3 ) in placebo / dexamethasone group , with a hazard ratio of 0 . 86 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 65 to 1 . 14 ) .

The major study was not designed nor powered to prospectively compare the efficacy of the 2 dosing regimens .
Sequential dose reductions to 5 mg daily and 5 mg every other day , as well as dose delays , were allowed for toxicity [ Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
This major study enrolled 148 patients who had RBC transfusion dependent anemia .
RBC transfusion dependence was defined as having received ≥ 2 units of RBCs within 8 weeks prior to study treatment .
The study enrolled patients with absolute neutrophil counts ( ANC ) ≥ 500 / mm3 , platelet counts ≥ 50 , 000 / mm3 , serum creatinine ≤ 2 . 5 mg / dL , serum SGOT / AST or SGPT / ALT ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal ( ULN ) , and serum direct bilirubin ≤ 2 mg / dL .
Granulocyte colony - stimulating factor was permitted for patients who developed neutropenia or fever in association with neutropenia .

b French - American - British ( FAB ) classification of MDS .
The frequency of RBC transfusion independence was assessed using criteria modified from the International Working Group ( IWG ) response criteria for MDS .
RBC transfusion independence was defined as the absence of any RBC transfusion during any consecutive “ rolling ” 56 days ( 8 weeks ) during the treatment period .
Transfusion independence was seen in 99 / 148 ( 67 % ) patients ( 95 % CI [ 59 , 74 ] ) .
The median duration from the date when RBC transfusion independence was first declared ( i . e . , the last day of the 56 - day RBC transfusion - free period ) to the date when an additional transfusion was received after the 56 - day transfusion - free period among the 99 responders was 44 weeks ( range of 0 to > 67 weeks ) .
Ninety percent of patients who achieved a transfusion benefit did so by completion of three months in the study .
RBC transfusion independence rates were unaffected by age or gender .
The dose of lenalidomide was reduced or interrupted at least once due to an adverse event in 118 ( 79 . 7 % ) of the 148 patients ; the median time to the first dose reduction or interruption was 21 days ( mean , 35 . 1 days ; range , 2 to 253 days ) , and the median duration of the first dose interruption was 22 days ( mean , 28 . 5 days ; range , 2 to 265 days ) .
A second dose reduction or interruption due to adverse events was required in 50 ( 33 . 8 % ) of the 148 patients .
The median interval between the first and second dose reduction or interruption was 51 days ( mean , 59 . 7 days ; range , 15 to 205 days ) and the median duration of the second dose interruption was 21 days ( mean , 26 days ; range , 2 to 148 days ) .
14 . 3 Mantle Cell Lymphoma A multicenter , single - arm , open - label trial of single - agent lenalidomide was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide in patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have relapsed after or were refractory to bortezomib or a bortezomib - containing regimen .
Patients with a creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL / min were given lenalidomide at a dose of 25 mg once daily for 21 days every 28 days .
Patients with a creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL / min and < 60 mL / min were given lenalidomide at a dose of 10 mg once daily for 21 days every 28 days .
Treatment was continued until disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , or withdrawal of consent .
The trial included patients who were at least 18 years of age with biopsy - proven MCL with measurable disease by CT scan .
Patients were required to have received prior treatment with an anthracycline or mitoxantrone , cyclophosphamide , rituximab , and bortezomib , alone or in combination .
Patients were required to have documented refractory disease ( defined as without any response of PR or better during treatment with bortezomib or a bortezomib - containing regimen ) , or relapsed disease ( defined as progression within one year after treatment with bortezomib or a bortezomib - containing regimen ) .
At enrollment patients were to have an absolute neutrophil counts ( ANC ) ≥ 1500 / mm3 , platelet counts ≥ 60 , 000 / mm3 , serum SGOT / AST or SGPT / ALT ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal ( ULN ) unless there was documented evidence of liver involvement by lymphoma , serum total bilirubin ≤ 1 . 5 x ULN except in cases of Gilbert ’ s syndrome or documented liver involvement by lymphoma , and calculated creatinine clearance ( Cockcroft - Gault formula ) ≥ 30 mL / min .
The median age was 67 years ( 43 to 83 ) , 81 % were male and 96 % were Caucasian .

b MIPI = MCL International Prognostic Index .
c High tumor burden is defined as at least one lesion that is ≥ 5 cm in diameter or 3 lesions that are ≥ 3 cm in diameter .
d Bulky disease is defined as at least one lesion that is ≥ 7 cm in the longest diameter .
The efficacy endpoints in the MCL trial were overall response rate ( ORR ) and duration of response ( DOR ) .
Response was determined based on review of radiographic scans by an independent review committee according to a modified version of the International Workshop Lymphoma Response Criteria ( Cheson , 1999 ) .
The DOR is defined as the time from the initial response ( at least PR ) to documented disease progression .
The efficacy results for the MCL population were based on all evaluable patients who received at least one dose of study drug and are presented in Table 20 .
The median time to response was 2 . 2 months ( range 1 . 8 to 13 months ) .

AUGMENT is a randomized , double - blind , multicenter trial ( n = 358 ) in which patients with relapsed or refractory follicular or marginal zone lymphoma were randomized 1 : 1 to receive lenalidomide and rituximab or rituximab and placebo .
AUGMENT included patients diagnosed with Grade 1 , 2 , or 3 a follicular lymphoma , who received at least 1 prior systemic therapy , were refractory or relapsed , not rituximab - refractory , had at least one measurable nodal or extranodal lesion by CT or MRI scan , and had adequate bone marrow , liver , and renal function .
Randomization was stratified by follicular versus marginal zone lymphoma , previous rituximab therapy , and time since other anti - lymphoma therapy .
In AUGMENT , lenalidomide was administered orally 20 mg once daily for Days 1 to 21 of repeating 28 - day cycles for a maximum of 12 cycles or until unacceptable toxicity .
The dose of rituximab was 375 mg / m2 every week in Cycle 1 ( Days 1 , 8 , 15 , and 22 ) and on Day 1 of every 28 - day cycle from Cycles 2 through 5 .
All dosage calculations for rituximab were based on the patient ’ s body surface area ( BSA ) , using actual patient weight .
Dose adjustments for lenalidomide were allowed based on clinical and laboratory findings .
A patient with moderate renal insufficiency ( ≥ 30 to < 60 mL / minute ) received a lower lenalidomide starting dose of 10 mg daily on the same schedule .
After 2 cycles , the lenalidomide dose could be increased to 15 mg once daily on Days 1 to 21 of each 28 - day cycle if the patient tolerated the medication .
MAGNIFY is an open - label , multicenter trial ( n = 232 ) in which patients with relapsed or refractory follicular , marginal zone , or mantle cell lymphoma received 12 induction cycles of lenalidomide and rituximab .
MAGNIFY included patients diagnosed with Grade 1 , 2 , 3 a , 3 b follicular ( including transformed ) , marginal zone , or mantle cell lymphoma Stage I to IV who were previously treated for their lymphoma , had been refractory or had a relapse after their last treatment , had at least one measurable nodal or extranodal lesion by CT or MRI scan , and had adequate bone marrow , liver , and renal function .
Patients refractory to rituximab were also included .
The information from the subjects who received at least 1 dose of initial therapy in the first 12 induction cycles ( n = 222 ) in the MAGNIFY trial was included in the evaluation of the efficacy of lenalidomide / rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory follicular and marginal zone lymphoma .
In MAGNIFY , lenalidomide 20 mg was given on Days 1 to 21 of repeated 28 - day cycles for up to 12 cycles or until unacceptable toxicity , progression , or withdrawal of consent .
The dose of rituximab was 375 mg / m2 every week in Cycle 1 ( Days 1 , 8 , 15 , and 22 ) and on Day 1 of every other 28 - day cycle ( Cycles 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , and 11 ) up to 12 cycles therapy .
All dosage calculations for rituximab were based on the patient BSA and actual weight .
