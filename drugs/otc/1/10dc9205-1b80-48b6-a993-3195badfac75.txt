• Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection is a sterile lyophilized powder for injection in single - dose vials containing vancomycin hydrochloride , USP equivalent to 250 mg , 750 mg , 1 . 25 g , or 1 . 5 g of vancomycin base ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to vancomycin .
• Hypersensitivity to vancomycin ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Infusion Reactions : Hypotension , including shock and cardiac arrest , wheezing , dyspnea , urticaria , muscular , chest pain and “ vancomycin infusion reaction ” which manifests as pruritus and erythema that involves the face , neck and upper torso may occur with rapid intravenous administration .
To reduce the risk of infusion reactions , administer Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection in a diluted solution over a period of 60 minutes or greater and also prior to intravenous anesthetic agents .
( 2 . 1 , 5 . 1 ) • • Nephrotoxicity : Systemic vancomycin exposure may result in acute kidney injury ( AKI ) including acute renal failure , mainly due to interstitial nephritis or less commonly acute tubular necrosis .
Monitor serum vancomycin concentrations and renal function .
( 5 . 2 ) • • Ototoxicity : Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving vancomycin hydrochloride .
Monitor for signs and symptoms of ototoxicity during therapy .
Monitor serum vancomycin concentrations and renal function .
Assessment of auditory function may be appropriate in some instances .
( 5 . 3 ) • • Severe Dermatologic Reactions : Discontinue Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection at the first appearance of skin rashes , mucosal lesions , or blisters .
( 5 . 4 ) • • Clostridioides difficile - Associated Diarrhea : Evaluate patients if diarrhea occurs .
( 5 . 5 ) • • Neutropenia : Periodically monitor leukocyte count .
( 5 . 7 ) • • Phlebitis : To reduce the risk of local irritation and phlebitis administer Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection by a secure intravenous route of administration .
( 5 . 8 ) • • Development of Drug - Resistant Bacteria : Prescribing Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug resistant bacteria .
( 5 . 9 ) 5 . 1 Infusion Reactions Hypotension , including shock and cardiac arrest , wheezing , dyspnea , urticaria , muscular and chest pain may occur with rapid Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection administration .
The reactions may be more severe in younger patients , particularly children , and in patients receiving concomitant muscle relaxant anesthetics .
Rapid intravenous administration of Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection may also be associated with “ vancomycin infusion reaction ” , which manifests as pruritus and erythema that involves the face , neck and upper torso .
Infusion - related adverse reactions are related to both the concentration and the rate of administration of vancomycin .
Infusion - related adverse reactions may occur , however , at any rate or concentration .
Administer Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection in a diluted solution over a period of 60 minutes or greater to reduce the risk of infusion - related adverse reactions .
In selected patients in need of fluid restriction , a concentration up to 10 mg / mL may be used ; use of such higher concentrations may increase the risk of infusion - related adverse reactions .
Administer prior to intravenous anesthetic agents when feasible .
Stop the infusion if a reaction occurs .
5 . 2 Nephrotoxicity Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection can result in acute kidney injury ( AKI ) , including acute renal failure , mainly due to interstitial nephritis or less commonly acute tubular necrosis .
AKI is manifested by increasing blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) and serum creatinine ( Cr ) .
The risk of AKI increases with higher vancomycin serum levels , prolonged exposure , concomitant administration of other nephrotoxic drugs , concomitant administration of piperacillin - tazobactam [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] , volume depletion , pre - existing renal impairment and in critically ill patients and patients with co - morbid conditions that predispose to renal impairment .
Monitor serum vancomycin concentrations and renal function in all patients receiving Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection .
More frequent monitoring is recommended in patients with comorbidities that predispose to impairment in renal function or are concomitantly receiving other nephrotoxic drugs , in critically ill patients , in patients with changing renal function , and in patients requiring higher therapeutic vancomycin levels .
If acute kidney injury occurs , discontinue Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection or reduce the dose .
5 . 3 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection .
It may be transient or permanent .
Ototoxicity manifests as tinnitus , hearing loss , dizziness or vertigo .
The risk is higher in older patients , patients who are receiving higher doses , who have an underlying hearing loss , who are receiving concomitant therapy with another ototoxic agent , such as an aminoglycoside or who have underlying renal impairment .
Monitor for signs and symptoms of ototoxicity during therapy .
Monitor serum vancomycin concentrations and renal function in all patients receiving parenteral vancomycin .
Discontinue Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection if ototoxicity occurs .
Dosage of Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection must be adjusted for patients with renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Serial tests of auditory function may be helpful in order to minimize the risk of ototoxicity .
5 . 4 Severe Dermatologic Reactions Severe dermatologic reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , Stevens - Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) , drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) , acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis ( AGEP ) , and linear IgA bullous dermatosis ( LABD ) have been reported in association with the use of vancomycin .
Cutaneous signs or symptoms reported include skin rashes , mucosal lesions , and blisters .
Discontinue Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection at the first appearance of signs and symptoms of TEN , SJS , DRESS , AGEP , or LABD .
5 . 5 Clostridioides difficile - Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile - associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibacterial treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
Clinically significant serum concentrations have been reported in some patients being treated for active C . difficile - induced pseudomembranous colitis after multiple oral doses of vancomycin .
Prolonged use of Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible microorganisms .
Careful observation of the patient is essential .
If superinfection occurs during therapy , appropriate measures should be taken .
In rare instances , there have been reports of pseudomembranous colitis due to C . difficile developing in patients who received intravenous Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection .
5 . 6 Hemorrhagic Occlusive Retinal Vasculitis ( HORV ) Hemorrhagic occlusive retinal vasculitis , including permanent loss of vision , occurred in patients receiving intracameral or intravitreal administration of vancomycin during or after cataract surgery .
The safety and efficacy of vancomycin administered by the intracameral or the intravitreal route have not been established by adequate and well - controlled trials .
Vancomycin is not indicated for the prophylaxis of endophthalmitis .
5 . 7 Neutropenia Reversible neutropenia has been reported in patients receiving Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Patients who will undergo prolonged therapy with Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection or those who are receiving concomitant drugs which may cause neutropenia should have periodic monitoring of the leukocyte count .
5 . 8 Phlebitis and Other Administration Site Reactions Inflammation at the site of injection of Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection has been reported .
Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection is irritating to tissue and must be given by a secure intravenous route of administration to reduce the risk of local irritation and phlebitis .
Administration of Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection by intramuscular ( IM ) , intraperitoneal , intrathecal ( intralumbar or intraventricular ) , or intravitreal routes has not been approved and is not recommended .
The safety and efficacy of vancomycin administered by the intrathecal ( intralumbar or intraventricular ) route or by the intraperitoneal route have not been established by adequate and well controlled trials .
Pain , tenderness , and necrosis occur with IM injection of Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection or with inadvertent extravasation .
Thrombophlebitis may occur , the frequency and severity of which can be minimized by administering the drug slowly as a dilute solution ( 2 . 5 to 5 g / L ) and by rotation of venous access sites .
Intraperitoneal administration during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) can result in chemical peritonitis .
Manifestations range from cloudy dialysate alone to a cloudy dialysate accompanied by variable degrees of abdominal pain and fever .
This syndrome appears to be resolve after discontinuation of intraperitoneal vancomycin .
5 . 9 Development of Drug - Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria .

No pharmacokinetic interactions have been noted between piperacillin / tazobactam and vancomycin .
7 . 3 Ototoxic and / or Nephrotoxic Drugs Concurrent and / or sequential systemic or topical use of other potentially , neurotoxic and / or nephrotoxic drugs requires more frequent monitoring of renal function .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on vancomycin use in pregnant women to inform a drug associated risk of major birth defects or miscarriage .
Available published data on vancomycin use in pregnancy during the second and third trimesters have not shown an association with adverse pregnancy related outcomes ( see Data ) .
Vancomycin did not show adverse developmental effects when administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses less than or equal to the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area ( see Data ) .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data A published study evaluated hearing loss and nephrotoxicity in infants of pregnant intravenous drug users treated with vancomycin for suspected or documented methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus - aureus in the second or third trimester .
The comparison groups were 10 non - intravenous drug - dependent patients who received no treatment , and 10 untreated intravenous drug - dependent patients who served as substance abuse controls .
No infant in the vancomycin exposed group had abnormal sensorineural hearing at 3 months of age or nephrotoxicity .
A published prospective study assessed outcomes in 55 pregnant women with a positive Group B streptococcus ( GBS ) culture and a high - risk penicillin allergy with resistance to clindamycin or unknown sensitivity who were administered vancomycin at the time of delivery .
Vancomycin dosing ranged from the standard 1 g intravenously every 12 hours to 20 mg / kg intravenous every 8 hours ( maximum individual dose 2 g ) .
No major adverse reactions were recorded either in the mothers or their newborns .
None of the newborns had sensorineural hearing loss .
Neonatal renal function was not examined , but all of the newborns were discharged in good condition .
Animal Data Vancomycin did not cause fetal malformations when administered during organogenesis to pregnant rats ( gestation days 6 to 15 ) and rabbits ( gestation days 6 to 18 ) at the equivalent recommended maximum human dose ( based on body surface area comparisons ) of 200 mg / kg / day IV to rats or 120 mg / kg / day IV to rabbits .
No effects on fetal weight or development were seen in rats at the highest dose tested or in rabbits given 80 mg / kg / day ( approximately 1 and 0 . 8 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area , respectively ) .
Maternal toxicity was observed in rats ( at doses 120 mg / kg and above ) and rabbits ( at 80 mg / kg and above ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are insufficient data to inform the levels of vancomycin in human milk .
There are no data on the effects of vancomycin on the breastfed infant or milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for vancomycin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from vancomycin or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection is indicated in pediatric patients ( neonates and older ) .
In pediatric patients , monitor vancomycin serum concentration and renal function when administering Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
More severe infusion related reactions related to vancomycin administration may occur in pediatric patients .
Concomitant administration of vancomycin and intravenous anesthetic agents has been associated with erythema and histamine - like flushing in all patients including pediatric patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] , and it may be useful to monitor renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Supportive care is advised , with maintenance of glomerular filtration .
Vancomycin is poorly removed by dialysis .
Hemofiltration and hemoperfusion with polysulfone resin have been reported to result in increased vancomycin clearance .
For current information on the management of overdosage , contact the National Poison Control Center at 1 - 800 - 222 - 1222 or www . poison . org .

The molecular formula is C66H75Cl2N9O24 • HCl and the molecular weight is 1 , 485 . 71 .
Vancomycin hydrochloride , USP has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection , USP is a sterile off - white to light tan colored lyophilized plug or powder for injection .
Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection , USP is supplied in single - dose vials , containing 256 mg , 769 mg , 1 . 28 g , or 1 . 54 g of vancomycin hydrochloride , USP equivalent to 250 mg , 750 mg , 1 . 25 g , or 1 . 5 g of vancomycin base .
The lyophilized powder is reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection , USP which forms a clear , colorless or light to dark tan solution and subsequently diluted prior to intravenous administration [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Vancomycin is an antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of vancomycin is unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In subjects with normal kidney function , multiple intravenous dosing of 1 g of vancomycin ( 15 mg / kg ) infused over 60 minutes produces mean plasma concentrations of approximately 63 mcg / mL immediately after the completion of infusion , mean plasma concentrations of approximately 23 mcg / mL 2 hours after infusion , and mean plasma concentrations of approximately 8 mcg / mL 11 hours after the end of the infusion .
Multiple dosing of 500 mg infused over 30 minutes produces mean plasma concentrations of about 49 mcg / mL at the completion of infusion , mean plasma concentrations of about 19 mcg / mL 2 hours after infusion , and mean plasma concentrations of about 10 mcg / mL 6 hours after infusion .
The plasma concentrations during multiple dosing are like those after a single dose .
Distribution The volume of distribution ranges from 0 . 3 to 0 . 43 L / kg after intravenous administration .
Vancomycin is approximately 55 % serum protein bound as measured by ultrafiltration at vancomycin serum concentrations of 10 to 100 mcg / mL .
After intravenous administration of vancomycin , inhibitory concentrations are present in pleural , pericardial , ascitic , and synovial fluids ; in urine ; in peritoneal dialysis fluid ; and in atrial appendage tissue .
Vancomycin does not readily diffuse across normal meninges into the spinal fluid ; but , when the meninges are inflamed , penetration into the spinal fluid occurs .
Elimination Mean plasma clearance is about 0 . 058 L / kg / h , and mean renal clearance is about 0 . 048 L / kg / h .
The mean elimination half - life of vancomycin from plasma is 4 to 6 hours in subjects with normal renal function .
In anephric patients , the mean elimination half - life is 7 . 5 days .
Total body and renal clearance of vancomycin may be reduced in the elderly .
Metabolism There is no apparent metabolism of the vancomycin .
Excretion In the first 24 hours after intravenous administration , about 75 % of an administered dose of vancomycin is excreted in urine by glomerular filtration .
Renal impairment slows excretion of vancomycin .
About 60 % of an intraperitoneal dose of vancomycin administered during peritoneal dialysis is absorbed systemically in 6 hours .
Serum concentrations of about 10 mcg / mL are achieved by intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg / kg of vancomycin .
However , the safety and efficacy of the intraperitoneal use of vancomycin has not been established in adequate and well - controlled trials [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal action of vancomycin results primarily from inhibition of cell - wall biosynthesis .
In addition , vancomycin alters bacterial - cell - membrane permeability and RNA synthesis .
Resistance Vancomycin is not active in vitro against gram - negative bacilli , mycobacteria , or fungi .
There is no cross - resistance between vancomycin and other antibacterials .
Interaction With Other Antimicrobials The combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside acts synergistically in vitro against many isolates of Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus gallolyticus ( previously known as Streptococcus bovis ) , enterococcus spp , and the viridans group streptococci .
Antimicrobial Activity Vancomycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
Aerobic Gram - Positive Bacteria Corynebacterium spp .
Enterococcus spp .
( including Enterococcus faecalis ) Staphylococcus aureus ( including methicillin - resistant and methicillin - susceptible isolates ) Coagulase negative staphylococci ( including S . epidermidis and methicillin - resistant isolates ) Streptococcus gallolyticus ( previously known as Streptococcus bovis ) Viridans group streptococci The following in vitro data are available , but their clinical significance is unknown .
At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for vancomycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group .
However , the efficacy of vancomycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well - controlled clinical trials .
Aerobic Gram - Positive Bacteria Listeria monocytogenes Streptococcus pyogenes Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus agalactiae Anaerobic Gram - Positive Bacteria Actinomyces species Lactobacillus species Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug , please see : https : / / www . fda . gov / STIC .
