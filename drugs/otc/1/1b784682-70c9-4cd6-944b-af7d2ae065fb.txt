7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel should not be used in combination with erythromycin - containing products because of its clindamycin component .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Erythromycin Clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel should not be used in combination with erythromycin - containing products due to possible antagonism to the clindamycin component .
In vitro studies have shown antagonism between these 2 antimicrobials .
The clinical significance of this in vitro antagonism is not known .
7 . 2 Neuromuscular Blocking Agents Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents .
Therefore , clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pediatric Use : The efficacy and safety have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years .
( 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C .
There are no well - controlled studies in pregnant women treated with clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel .
Clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
A limit teratology study performed in Sprague Dawley rats treated topically with clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel or 0 . 025 % tretinoin gel at a dose of 2 mL / kg during gestation days 6 to 15 did not result in teratogenic effects .
Although no systemic levels of tretinoin were detected , craniofacial and heart abnormalities were described in drug - treated groups .
These abnormalities are consistent with retinoid effects and occurred at 16 times the recommended clinical dose assuming 100 % absorption and based on body surface area comparison .
For purposes of comparison of the animal exposure to human exposure , the recommended clinical dose is defined as 1 g of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel applied daily to a 50 - kg person .
Clindamycin : Reproductive developmental toxicity studies performed in rats and mice using oral doses of clindamycin up to 600 mg / kg / day ( 480 and 240 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison , respectively ) or subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 180 mg / kg / day ( 140 and 70 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison , respectively ) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity .
Tretinoin : Oral tretinoin has been shown to be teratogenic in mice , rats , hamsters , rabbits , and primates .
It was teratogenic and fetotoxic in Wistar rats when given orally at doses greater than 1 mg / kg / day ( 32 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison ) .
However , variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported .
In the cynomologous monkey , a species in which tretinoin metabolism is closer to humans than in other species examined , fetal malformations were reported at oral doses of 10 mg / kg / day or greater , but none were observed at 5 mg / kg / day ( 324 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison ) , although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses .
Dose - related teratogenic effects and increased abortion rates were reported in pigtail macaques .
With widespread use of any drug , a small number of birth defect reports associated temporally with the administration of the drug would be expected by chance alone .
Thirty cases of temporally associated congenital malformations have been reported during 2 decades of clinical use of another formulation of topical tretinoin .
Although no definite pattern of teratogenicity and no causal association have been established from these cases , 5 of the reports describe the rare birth defect category , holoprosencephaly ( defects associated with incomplete midline development of the forebrain ) .
The significance of these spontaneous reports in terms of risk to fetus is not known .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether clindamycin is excreted in human milk following use of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel .
However , orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been reported to appear in breast milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
It is not known whether tretinoin is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established .
Clinical trials of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel included 2 , 086 patients aged 12 - 17 years of age with acne vulgaris .
[ See Clinical Studies ( 14 ) . ]
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
11 DESCRIPTION Clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel , 1 . 2 % / 0 . 025 % , is a fixed combination of 2 solubilized active ingredients in an aqueous - based gel .
Clindamycin phosphate is a water soluble ester of the semi - synthetic antibiotic produced by a 7 ( S ) - chloro - substitution of the 7 ( R ) - hydroxyl group of the parent antibiotic lincomycin .
The chemical name for clindamycin phosphate is methyl 7 - chloro - 6 , 7 , 8 - trideoxy - 6 - ( 1 - methyl - trans - 4 - propyl - L - 2 - pyrrolidinecarboxamido ) - 1 - thio - L - threo - α - D - galacto - octopyranoside 2 - ( dihydrogen phosphate ) .
The structural formula for clindamycin phosphate is represented below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Molecular Formula : C18H34ClN2O8PS Molecular Weight : 504 . 97 The chemical name for tretinoin is all - trans 3 , 7 - dimethyl - 9 - ( 2 , 6 , 6 - trimethyl - 1 - cyclohexen - 1 - yl ) - 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 - nonatetraenoic acid .
It is a member of the retinoid family of compounds .
The structural formula for tretinoin is represented below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Molecular Formula : C20H28O2 Molecular Weight : 300 . 44 Clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel contains the following inactive ingredients : anhydrous citric acid , butylated hydroxytoluene , carbomer homopolymer ( type C ) , edetate disodium , laureth 4 , methylparaben , propylene glycol , purified water , and tromethamine .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Clindamycin : [ See Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) . ]
Tretinoin : Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown , current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedone formation .
Additionally , tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In an open - label study of 17 patients with moderate - to - severe acne vulgaris , topical administration of approximately 3 grams of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel once daily for 5 days , clindamycin concentrations were quantifiable in all 17 patients starting from 1 hour post - dose .
All plasma clindamycin concentrations were ≤ 5 . 56 ng / mL on Day 5 , with the exception of 1 subject who had a maximum clindamycin concentration of 8 . 73 ng / mL at 4 hours post - dose .
There was no appreciable increase in systemic exposure to tretinoin , as compared with the baseline value .
The average tretinoin concentration across all sampling times on Day 5 ranged from 1 . 19 to 1 . 23 ng / mL compared with the corresponding baseline mean tretinoin concentration range of 1 . 16 to 1 . 30 ng / mL .
12 . 4 Microbiology No microbiology studies were conducted in the clinical trials with this product .
Mechanism of Action : Clindamycin binds to the 50 S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria and prevents elongation of peptide chains by interfering with peptidyl transfer , thereby suppressing protein synthesis .
Clindamycin has been shown to have in vitro activity against Propionibacterium acnes ( P . acnes ) , an organism that has been associated with acne vulgaris ; however , the clinical significance of this activity against P . acnes was not examined in clinical studies with clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel .
P . acnes resistance to clindamycin has been documented .
Inducible Clindamycin Resistance : The treatment of acne with antimicrobials is associated with the development of antimicrobial resistance in P . acnes as well as other bacteria ( e . g . , Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus pyogenes ) .
The use of clindamycin may result in developing inducible resistance in these organisms .
This resistance is not detected by routine susceptibility testing .
Cross Resistance : Resistance to clindamycin is often associated with resistance to erythromycin .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel or the effect of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel on fertility .
Clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel was negative for mutagenic potential when evaluated in an in vitro Ames Salmonella reversion assay .
Clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel was equivocal for clastogenic potential in the absence of metabolic activation when tested in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay .
Clindamycin : Once - daily dermal administration of 1 % clindamycin as clindamycin phosphate in the gel vehicle ( 32 mg / kg / day , 13 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison ) to mice for up to 2 years did not produce evidence of tumorigenicity .
Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg / kg / day of clindamycin ( 240 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison ) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability .
Tretinoin : In 2 independent mouse studies where tretinoin was administered topically ( 0 . 025 % or 0 . 1 % ) 3 times per week for up to 2 years no carcinogenicity was observed , with maximum effects of dermal amyloidosis .
However , in a dermal carcinogenicity study in mice , tretinoin applied at a dose of 5 . 1 mcg ( 1 . 4 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison ) 3 times per week for 20 weeks acted as a weak promoter of skin tumor formation following a single application of dimethylbenz [ α ] anthracene ( DMBA ) .
In a study in female SENCAR mice , papillomas were induced by topical exposure to DMBA followed by promotion with 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate or mezerein for up to 20 weeks .
Topical application of tretinoin prior to each application of promoting agent resulted in a reduction in the number of papillomas per mouse .
However , papillomas resistant to topical tretinoin suppression were at higher risk for pre - malignant progression .
Tretinoin has been shown to enhance photoco - carcinogenicity in properly performed specific studies , employing concurrent or intercurrent exposure to tretinoin and UV radiation .
The photoco - carcinogenic potential of the clindamycin tretinoin combination is unknown .
Although the significance of these studies to humans is not clear , patients should avoid exposure to sun .
The genotoxic potential of tretinoin was evaluated in an in vitro Ames Salmonella reversion test and an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells .
Both tests were negative .
In oral fertility studies in rats treated with tretinoin , the no - observed - effect - level was 2 mg / kg / day ( 64 times the recommended clinical dose based on body surface area comparison ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel , applied once daily for the treatment of acne vulgaris , was evaluated in 12 - week multi - center , randomized , blinded studies in subjects 12 years and older .
Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who had a 2 - grade improvement from baseline to Week 12 based on the Investigator ’ s Global Assessment ( IGA ) and a mean absolute change from baseline to Week 12 in 2 out of 3 ( total , inflammatory and non - inflammatory ) lesion counts .
The IGA scoring scale used in all the clinical trials for clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel is as follows : 0 Clear Normal , clear skin with no evidence of acne vulgaris .
1 Almost Clear Skin almost clear ; rare non - inflammatory lesions present , with rare non - inflamed papules ( papules must be resolving and may be hyperpigmented , though not pink - red ) requiring no further treatment in the Investigator ’ s opinion .
2 Mild Some non - inflammatory lesions are present , with few inflammatory lesions ( papules / pustules only , no nodulo - cystic lesions ) .
3 Moderate Non - inflammatory lesions predominate , with multiple inflammatory lesions evident ; several - to - many comedones and papules / pustules , and there may or may not be 1 small nodulo - cystic lesion .
4 Severe Inflammatory lesions are more apparent ; many comedones and papules / pustules , there may or may not be a few nodulo - cystic lesions .
5 Very Severe Highly inflammatory lesions predominate ; variable numbers of comedones , many papules / pustules and nodulo - cystic lesions .
In Study 1 , 1 , 649 subjects were randomized to clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel , clindamycin gel , tretinoin gel , and vehicle gel .
The median age of subjects was 17 years and 58 % were females .
At baseline , subjects had an average of 71 total lesions of which the mean number of inflammatory lesions was 25 . 5 lesions and the mean number of non - inflammatory lesions was 45 . 1 lesions .
The majority of subjects enrolled with a baseline IGA score of 3 .
The efficacy results at Week 12 are presented in Table 3 .
