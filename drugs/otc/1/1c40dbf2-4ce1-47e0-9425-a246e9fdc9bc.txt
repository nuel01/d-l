DESCRIPTION Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution , 0 . 5 % is a sterile solution that contains albuterol sulfate , USP , the racemic form of albuterol and a relatively selective beta2 - adrenergic bronchodilator ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGYsection below ) .
Albuterol sulfate has the chemical name α1 - [ ( tert — Butylamino ) methyl ] - 4 - hydroxy - m - xylene - α , α ’ - diol sulfate ( 2 : 1 ) ( salt ) , and the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Albuterol sulfate has a molecular weight of 576 . 71 and the molecular formula ( C13H21NO3 ) 2 • H2SO4 .
Albuterol sulfate is a white crystalline powder , soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol .
The World Health Organization ’ s recommended name for albuterol base is salbutamol .
Albuterol sulfate inhalation solution , 0 . 5 % is in concentrated form .
Dilute the appropriate volume of the solution ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) with sterile normal saline solution to a total volume of 3 mL and administer by nebulization .
Each mL Contains : ACTIVE : Albuterol sulfate equivalent to 5 mg of albuterol in an aqueous solution .
Sulfuric Acid may be added to adjust pH ( 3 . 0 - 5 . 0 ) .
PRESERVATIVE ADDED : Benzalkonium Chloride 0 . 01 % .
Albuterol sulfate inhalation solution contains no sulfiting agents .
It is supplied in 20 mL bottles .
Albuterol Aulfate Inhalation Solution is a clear , colorless to light yellow solution .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY In vitro studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that albuterol has a preferential effect on beta2 - adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol .
While it is recognized that beta2 - adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle , data indicate that there is a population of beta2 - receptors in the human heart existing in a concentration between 10 % and 50 % .
The precise function of these receptors has not been established ( see WARNINGS ) .
The pharmacologic effects of beta - adrenergic agonist drugs , including albuterol , are at least in part attributable to stimulation through beta - adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase , the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) to cyclic - 3 ' , 5 ' - adenosine monophosphate ( cyclic AMP ) .
Increased cyclic AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells , especially from mast cells .
Albuterol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract , in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation , than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects .
Controlled clinical studies and other clinical experience have shown that inhaled albuterol , like other beta - adrenergic agonist drugs , can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients , as measured by pulse rate , blood pressure , symptoms , and / or electrocardiographic changes .
Albuterol is longer acting than isoproterenol in most patients by any route of administration because it is not a substrate for the cellular uptake processes for catecholamines nor for catechol - O - methyl transferase .
Pharmacokinetics Studies in asthmatic patients have shown that less than 20 % of a single albuterol dose was absorbed following either intermittent positive - pressure breathing ( IPPB ) or nebulizer administration ; the remaining amount was recovered from the nebulizer and apparatus and expired air .
Most of the absorbed dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours after drug administration .
Following a 3 - mg dose of nebulized albuterol in adults , the maximum albuterol plasma levels at 0 . 5 hours were 2 . 1 ng / mL ( range , 1 . 4 to 3 . 2 ng / mL ) .
There was a significant dose - related response in FEV1 ( forced expiratory volume in 1 second ) and peak flow rate .
It has been demonstrated that following oral administration of 4 mg of albuterol , the elimination half - life was 5 to 6 hours .
Preclinical Intravenous studies in rats with albuterol sulfate have demonstrated that albuterol crosses the blood - brain barrier and reaches brain concentrations amounting to approximately 5 . 0 % of the plasma concentrations .
In structures outside the brain barrier ( pineal and pituitary glands ) , albuterol concentrations were found to be 100 times those in the whole brain .
Studies in laboratory animals ( minipigs , rodents , and dogs ) have demonstrated the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death ( with histologic evidence of myocardial necrosis ) when beta - agonists and methylxanthines are administered concurrently .
The clinical significance of these findings is unknown .
Clinical Trials In controlled clinical trials in adults , most patients exhibited an onset of improvement in pulmonary function within 5 minutes as determined by FEV1 .
FEV1 measurements also showed that the maximum average improvement in pulmonary function usually occurred at approximately 1 hour following inhalation of 2 . 5 mg of albuterol by compressor - nebulizer and remained close to peak for 2 hours .
Clinically significant improvement in pulmonary function ( defined as maintenance of a 15 % or more increase in FEV1 over baseline values ) continued for 3 to 4 hours in most patients , with some patients continuing up to 6 hours .
Published reports of trials in asthmatic children aged 3 years or older have demonstrated significant improvement in either FEV1 or PEFR within 2 to 20 minutes following single doses of albuterol inhalation solution .
An increase of 15 % or more in baseline FEV1 has been observed in children aged 5 to 11 years up to 6 hours after treatment with doses of 0 . 10 mg / kg or higher of albuterol inhalation solution .
Single doses of 3 , 4 , or 10 mg resulted in improvement in baseline PEFR that was comparable in extent and duration to a 2 - mg dose , but doses above 3 mg were associated with heart rate increases of more than 10 % .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Albuterol sulfate inhalation solution is indicated for the relief of bronchospasm in patients 2 years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease and acute attacks of bronchospasm .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Albuterol sulfate inhalation solution is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to albuterol or any of its components .
WARNINGS Paradoxical Bronchospasm Albuterol sulfate inhalation solution can produce paradoxical bronchospasm , which may be life threatening .
If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs , albuterol sulfate inhalation solution should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted .
It should be recognized that paradoxical bronchospasm , when associated with inhaled formulations , frequently occurs with the first use of a new canister or vial .
Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs and with the home use of nebulizers .
It is therefore essential that the physician instruct the patient in the need for further evaluation if his / her asthma becomes worse .
Cardiovascular Effects Albuterol sulfate inhalation solution , like all other beta - adrenergic agonists , can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients as measured by pulse rate , blood pressure , and / or symptoms .
Although such effects are uncommon after administration of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution at recommended doses , if they occur , the drug may need to be discontinued .
In addition , beta - agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram ( ECG ) changes , such as flattening of the T wave , prolongation of the QTC interval , and ST segment depression .
The clinical significance of these findings is unknown .
Therefore , albuterol sulfate inhalation solution , like all sympathomimetic amines , should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders , especially coronary insufficiency , cardiac arrhythmias , and hypertension .
Deterioration of Asthma Asthma may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer .
If the patient needs more doses of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution than usual , this may be a marker of destabilization of asthma and requires reevaluation of the patient and treatment regimen , giving special consideration to the possible need for anti - inflammatory treatment , e . g . , corticosteroids .
Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of albuterol , as demonstrated by rare cases of urticaria , angioedema , rash , bronchospasm , and oropharyngeal edema .
Use of Anti - inflammatory Agents The use of beta - adrenergic agonist bronchodilators alone may not be adequate to control asthma in many patients .
Early consideration should be given to adding anti - inflammatory agents , eg , corticosteroids .
Microbial Contamination It is recommended that each multi - dose bottle of albuterol be used for only one patient .
Nosocomial outbreaks of pneumonia have occurred in hospitals when one multi - dose bottle of albuterol was used to treat more than one patient .
To avoid microbial contamination , proper aseptic technique should be used each time the bottle is opened .
Precautions should be taken to prevent contact of the dropper tip of the bottle with any surface , including the nebulizer reservoir and associated ventilatory equipment .
In addition , if the solution changes color or becomes cloudy , it should not be used .
PRECAUTIONS General Albuterol , as with all sympathomimetic amines , should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders , especially coronary insufficiency , hypertension , and cardiac arrhythmia ; in patients with convulsive disorders , hyperthyroidism , or diabetes mellitus ; and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines .
Clinically significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been seen in individual patients and could be expected to occur in some patients after use of any betaadrenergic bronchodilator .
Large doses of intravenous albuterol have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis .
As with other beta - agonists , albuterol may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients , possibly through intracellular shunting , which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects .
The decrease is usually transient , not requiring supplementation .
Repeated dosing with 0 . 15 mg / kg of albuterol inhalation solution in children aged 5 to 17 years who were initially normokalemic has been associated with an asymptomatic decline of 20 % to 25 % in serum potassium levels .
To avoid contaminating the multi - dose bottle of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution for inhalation , proper aseptic technique should be used when withdrawing and delivering the dose into the nebulizer .
Information for patients The action of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution may last up to 6 hours or longer .
Albuterol sulfate inhalation solution should not be used more frequently than recommended .
Do not increase the dose or frequency of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution without consulting your physician .
If you find that treatment with albuterol sulfate inhalation solution becomes less effective for symptomatic relief , your symptoms become worse , and / or you need to use the product more frequently than usual , you should seek medical attention immediately .
While you are using albuterol sulfate inhalation solution , other inhaled drugs and asthma medications should be taken only as directed by your physician .
Common adverse effects include palpitations , chest pain , rapid heart rate , and tremor or nervousness .
If you are pregnant or nursing , contact your physician about use of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution .
Effective and safe use of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution includes an understanding of the way that it should be administered .
Drug compatibility ( physical and chemical ) , efficacy , and safety of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established .
See illustrated " Patient Instructions For Use . "
Drug interactions Other short - acting sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators or epinephrine should not be used concomitantly with albuterol .
If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route , they should be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular effects .
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants Albuterol should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants , or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents , because the action of albuterol on the vascular system may be potentiated .
Beta - Blockers Beta - adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta - agonists , such as albuterol sulfate inhalation solution , but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients .
Therefore , patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta - blockers .
However , under certain circumstances , e . g . , as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction , there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta - adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma .
In this setting , cardioselective beta - blockers could be considered , although they should be administered with caution .
Diuretics The ECG changes and / or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of nonpotassium - sparing diuretics ( such as loop or thiazide diuretics ) can be acutely worsened by beta - agonists , especially when the recommended dose of the beta - agonist is exceeded .
Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known , caution is advised in the coadministration of beta - agonists with nonpotassium - sparing diuretics .
Digoxin Mean decreases of 16 % to 22 % in serum digoxin levels were demonstrated after single - dose intravenous and oral administration of albuterol , respectively , to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days .
The clinical significance of these findings for patients with obstructive airway disease who are receiving albuterol and digoxin on a chronic basis is unclear .
Nevertheless , it would be prudent to carefully evaluate the serum digoxin levels in patients who are currently receiving digoxin and albuterol .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a 2 - year study in Sprague - Dawley rats , albuterol sulfate caused a significant dose - related increase in the incidence of benign leiomyomas of the mesovarium at dietary doses of 2 . 0 , 10 , and 50 mg / kg ( approximately 2 , 8 , and 40 times , respectively , the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg / m2 basis or approximately 3 / 5 , 3 , and 15 times , respectively , the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in children on a mg / m2 basis ) .
In another study this effect was blocked by the coadministration of propranolol , a nonselective beta - adrenergic antagonist .
In an 18 - month study in CD - 1 mice , albuterol sulfate showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at dietary doses of up to 500 mg / kg ( approximately 200 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg / m2 basis or approximately 75 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for children on a mg / m2 basis ) .
In a 22 - month study in the Golden hamster , albuterol sulfate showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at dietary doses of up to 50 mg / kg ( approximately 25 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg / m2 basis or approximately 10 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for children on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Albuterol sulfate was not mutagenic in the Ames test with or without metabolic activation using tester strains S . typhimurium TA1537 , TA1538 , and TA98 or E . coli WP2 , WP2uvrA , and WP67 .
No forward mutation was seen in yeast strain S . cerevisiae S9 nor any mitotic gene conversion in yeast strain S . cerevisiae JD1 with or without metabolic activation .
Fluctuation assays in S . typhimurium TA98 and E . coli WP2 , both with metabolic activation , were negative .
Albuterol sulfate was not clastogenic in a human peripheral lymphocyte assay or in an AH1 strain mouse micronucleus assay at intraperitoneal doses of up to 200 mg / kg .
Reproduction studies in rats demonstrated no evidence of impaired fertility at oral doses up to 50 mg / kg ( approximately 40 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C . Albuterol has been shown to be teratogenic in mice .
A study in CD - 1 mice at subcutaneous ( sc ) doses of 0 . 025 , 0 . 25 , and 2 . 5 mg / kg ( approximately 1 / 100 , 1 / 10 , and 1 . 0 times , respectively , the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg / m2 basis ) showed cleft palate formation in 5 of 111 ( 4 . 5 % ) fetuses at 0 . 25 mg / kg and in 10 of 108 ( 9 . 3 % ) fetuses at 2 . 5 mg / kg .
The drug did not induce cleft palate formation at the lowest dose , 0 . 025 mg / kg .
Cleft palate also occurred in 22 of 72 ( 30 . 5 % ) fetuses from females treated with 2 . 5 mg / kg of isoproterenol ( positive control ) subcutaneously ( approximately 1 . 0 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg / m2 basis ) .
A reproduction study in Stride Dutch rabbits revealed cranioschisis in 7 of 19 ( 37 % ) fetuses when albuterol was administered orally at a 50 - mg / kg dose ( approximately 80 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg / m2 basis ) .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Albuterol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
During worldwide marketing experience , various congenital anomalies , including cleft palate and limb defects , have been rarely reported in the offspring of patients being treated with albuterol .
Some of the mothers were taking multiple medications during their pregnancies .
No consistent pattern of defects can be discerned , and a relationship between albuterol use and congenital anomalies has not been established .
Labor and delivery Because of the potential for beta - agonist interference with uterine contractility , use of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution for relief of bronchospasm during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risk .
Tocolysis Albuterol has not been approved for the management of preterm labor .
The benefit : risk ratio when albuterol is administered for tocolysis has not been established .
Serious adverse reactions , including maternal pulmonary edema , have been reported during or following treatment of premature labor with beta2 - agonists , including albuterol .
Nursing mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for albuterol in some animal studies , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
Pediatric use The safety and effectiveness of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution have been established in children 2 years of age and older .
Use of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution in these age - groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution in adults ; the likelihood that the disease course , pathophysiology , and the drug ’ s effect in pediatric and adult patients are substantially similar ; and published reports of trials in pediatric patients 3 years of age or older .
The recommended dose for the pediatric population is based upon three published dose comparison studies of efficacy and safety in children 5 to 17 years , and on the safety profile in both adults and pediatric patients at doses equal to or higher than the recommended doses .
The safety and effectiveness of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution in children below 2 years of age have not been established .

Cases of urticaria , angioedema , rash , bronchospasm , hoarseness , oropharyngeal edema , and arrhythmias ( including atrial fibrillation , supraventicular tachycardia , extrasystoles ) have been reported after the use of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution .
OVERDOSAGE The expected symptoms with overdosage are those of excessive betaadrenergic stimulation and / or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the symptoms listed under ADVERSE REACTIONS , e . g . , seizures , angina , hypertension or hypotension , tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats / min , arrhythmias , nervousness , headache , tremor , dry mouth , palpitation , nausea , dizziness , fatigue , malaise , and sleeplessness .
Hypokalemia may also occur .
In isolated cases in children 2 to 12 years of age , tachycardia with rates > 200 beats / min has been observed .
As with all sympathomimetic medications , cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with abuse of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution .
Treatment consists of discontinuation of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution together with appropriate symptomatic therapy .
The judicious use of a cardioselective beta - receptor blocker may be considered , bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm .
There is insufficient evidence to determine if dialysis is beneficial for overdosage of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution .
Cases of urticaria , angioedema , rash , bronchospasm , hoarseness , oropharyngeal edema , and arrhythmias ( including atrial fibrillation , supraventricular tachycardia , and extrasystoles ) have been reported after the use of inhaled albuterol .
Outbreaks of nosocomial infection ( including infection with Burkholderia cepacia ) have been reported with the inadvertent in - use contamination of multi - dose albuterol sulfate inhalation solution ( see WARNINGS , Microbial Contamination ) .
These outbreaks occurred when a single multi - dose vial was used to treat multiple patients and may have been due to improper aseptic technique .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION To avoid microbial contamination , proper aseptic techniques should be used each time the bottle is opened .
Precautions should be taken to prevent contact of the dropper tip of the bottle with any surface , including the nebulizer reservoir and associated ventilatory equipment .
In addition , if the solution changes color or becomes cloudy , it should not be used .
Children 2 to 12 Years of Age For children 2 to 12 years of age , initial dosing should be based upon body weight ( 0 . 1 to 0 . 15 mg / kg per dose ) , with subsequent dosing titrated to achieve the desired clinical response .
Dosing should not exceed 2 . 5 mg three to four times daily by nebulization .
The following table outlines approximate dosing according to body weight .
Approximate Weight ( kg ) Approximate Weight ( lb ) Dose ( mg ) Volume of Inhalation Solution 10 - 15 22 - 33 1 . 25 0 . 25 mL > 15 > 33 2 . 5 0 . 5 mL The appropriate volume of the 0 . 5 % inhalation solution should be diluted in sterile normal saline solution to a total volume of 3 mL prior to administration via nebulization .
Adults and Children Over 12 Years of Age The usual dosage for adults and children 12 years of age and older is 2 . 5 mg of albuterol administered three to four times daily by nebulization .
More frequent administration or higher doses are not recommended .
To administer 2 . 5 mg of albuterol , dilute 0 . 5 mL of the 0 . 5 % inhalation solution with 2 . 5 mL of sterile normal saline solution .
The flow rate is regulated to suit the particular nebulizer so that albuterol sulfate inhalation solution will be delivered over approximately 5 to 15 minutes .
The use of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution can be continued as medically indicated to control recurring bouts of bronchospasm .
During this time most patients gain optimal benefit from regular use of the inhalation solution .
If a previously effective dosage regimen fails to provide the usual relief , medical advice should be sought immediately as this is often a sign of seriously worsening asthma that would require reassessment of therapy .
Drug compatibility ( physical and chemical ) , efficacy , and safety of albuterol sulfate inhalation solution when mixed with other drugs in a nebulizer have not been established .
