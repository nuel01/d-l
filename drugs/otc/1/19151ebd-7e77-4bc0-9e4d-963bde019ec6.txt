DESCRIPTION Sterile Water for Injection , USP is sterile , nonpyrogenic , distilled water in a Pharmacy Bulk Package .
A Pharmacy Bulk Package is a container of a sterile preparation for parenteral use that contains many single doses .
The contents are intended for use in a pharmacy admixture program and are restricted to the preparation of admixtures for intravenous infusion .
No antimicrobial or other substance has been added .
pH 5 . 5 ( 5 . 0 to 7 . 0 ) .
Osmolarity O mOsmol / L ( calc . )
.
The VIAFLEX plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinyl chloride ( PL 146 Plastic ) .
Exposure to temperatures above 25 ° C / 77 ° F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content .
Higher temperatures lead to greater losses .
It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period .
The amount of water that can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts ; however , biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Sterile Water for Injection , USP is used for fluid replacement only after suitable admixing to approximate isotonicity .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sterile Water for Injection , USP is indicated in the aseptic preparation of parenteral admixtures .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Sterile Water for Injection , USP is a hemolytic agent due to its hypotonicity .

WARNING : This product contains aluminum that may be toxic .
Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired .
Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature , and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions , which contain aluminum .
Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function , including premature neonates , who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 µg / kg / day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity .
Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration .
PRECAUTIONS Do not use unless solution is clear and seal is intact .
Drug product contains no more than 25 µg / L of aluminum .
Pediatric Use : Safety and effectiveness have been established in pediatric patients .
However , in neonates or very small infants the volume of fluid may affect fluid and electrolyte balance .
ADVERSE REACTIONS The administration of a suitable admixture of prescribed drugs may be associated with adverse reactions because of the solution or the technique of administration including febrile response , infection at the site of injection , venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection , extravasation and hypervolemia .
If an adverse reaction does occur , discontinue the infusion , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Following suitable admixture of prescribed drugs , the dosage is usually dependent upon the age , weight and clinical condition of the patient as well as laboratory determinations .
See directions accompanying drugs .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit .

The opacity will diminish gradually .
Check for minute leaks by squeezing inner bag firmly , if leaks are found , discard solution as sterility may be impaired .
For compounding only , not for direct infusion .
Preparation for Admixing • 1 .
