WARNING : SPINAL / EPIDURAL HEMATOMAS Epidural or spinal hematomas may occur in patients who are anticoagulated with low molecular weight heparins ( LMWH ) , heparinoids , or fondaparinux sodium and are receiving neuraxial anesthesia or undergoing spinal puncture .
These hematomas may result in long - term or permanent paralysis .
Consider these risks when scheduling patients for spinal procedures .
Factors that can increase the risk of developing epidural or spinal hematomas in these patients include : • • use of indwelling epidural catheters • • concomitant use of other drugs that affect hemostasis , such as non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , platelet inhibitors , or other anticoagulants • • a history of traumatic or repeated epidural or spinal puncture • • a history of spinal deformity or spinal surgery • • Optimal timing between the administration of fondaparinux sodium and neuraxial procedures is not known .
Monitor patients frequently for signs and symptoms of neurologic impairment .
If neurologic compromise is noted , urgent treatment is necessary .
Consider the benefit and risks before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or to be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .

2 . 6 Instructions for Use Fondaparinux sodium injection is provided in a single - dose , prefilled syringe affixed with an automatic needle protection system .
Fondaparinux sodium is administered by subcutaneous injection .
It must not be administered by intramuscular injection .
Fondaparinux sodium injection is intended for use under a physician ’ s guidance .
Patients may self - inject only if their physician determines that it is appropriate and the patients are trained in subcutaneous injection techniques .
Prior to administration , visually inspect fondaparinux sodium injection to ensure the solution is clear and free of particulate matter .
To avoid the loss of drug when using the prefilled syringe , do not expel the air bubble from the syringe before the injection .
Administration should be made in the fatty tissue , alternating injection sites ( e . g . , between the left and right anterolateral or the left and right posterolateral abdominal wall ) .
To administer fondaparinux sodium injection : • 1 .
Wipe the surface of the injection site with an alcohol swab .
• 2 .
Hold the syringe with either hand and use your other hand to twist the rigid needle guard ( covers the needle ) counter - clockwise .
Pull the rigid needle guard straight off the needle ( Figure 1 ) .
Discard the needle guard .
• 3 .
Do not try to remove the air bubbles from the syringe before giving the injection .
• 4 .
Pinch a fold of skin at the injection site between your thumb and forefinger and hold it throughout the injection .
• 5 .
Hold the syringe with your thumb on the top pad of the plunger rod and your next 2 fingers on the finger grips on the syringe barrel .
Pay attention to avoid sticking yourself with the exposed needle ( Figure 2 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] • 6 .
Insert the full length of the syringe needle perpendicularly into the skin fold held between the thumb and forefinger ( Figure 3 ) .
• 7 .
Push the plunger rod firmly with your thumb as far as it will go .
This will ensure you have injected all the contents of the syringe ( Figure 4 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] • 8 .
When you have injected all the contents of the syringe , the plunger should be released .
The plunger will then rise automatically while the needle withdraws from the skin and retracts into the security sleeve .
Discard the syringe into the sharps container .
• 9 .
You will know that the syringe has worked when : • • The needle is pulled back into the security sleeve and the white safety indicator appears above the upper body .
• • You may also hear or feel a soft click when the plunger rod is released fully .

Fondaparinux sodium injection is contraindicated in the following conditions : ( 4 ) • • Severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min ) in prophylaxis or treatment of venous thromboembolism .
• • Active major bleeding .
• • Bacterial endocarditis .
• • Thrombocytopenia associated with a positive in vitro test for anti - platelet antibody in the presence of fondaparinux sodium .
• • Body weight < 50 kg ( venous thromboembolism prophylaxis only ) .
• • History of serious hypersensitivity reaction ( e . g . , angioedema , anaphylactoid / anaphylactic reactions ) to fondaparinux sodium .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Spinal or epidural hematomas , which may result in long - term or permanent paralysis , can occur .
( 5 . 1 ) • • Patients taking fondaparinux sodium with risk factors for bleeding are at increased risk of hemorrhage .
( 5 . 2 ) • • Bleeding risk is increased in renal impairment and in patients with low body weight < 50 kg .
( 5 . 3 , 5 . 4 ) • • Thrombocytopenia can occur with administration of fondaparinux sodium .
( 5 . 5 ) • • Periodic routine complete blood counts ( including platelet counts ) , serum creatinine level , and stool occult blood tests are recommended .
( 5 . 6 ) • • The packaging ( needle guard ) contains dry natural rubber and may cause allergic reactions in latex sensitive individuals .
( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Neuraxial Anesthesia and Post - operative Indwelling Epidural Catheter Use Spinal or epidural hematomas , which may result in long - term or permanent paralysis , can occur with the use of anticoagulants and neuraxial ( spinal / epidural ) anesthesia or spinal puncture .
The risk of these events may be higher with post - operative use of indwelling epidural catheters or concomitant use of other drugs affecting hemostasis such as NSAIDs [ see Boxed Warning ] .
In the postmarketing experience , epidural or spinal hematoma has been reported in association with the use of fondaparinux sodium by subcutaneous ( SC ) injection .
Optimal timing between the administration of fondaparinux sodium and neuraxial procedures is not known .
Monitor patients undergoing these procedures for signs and symptoms of neurologic impairment such as midline back pain , sensory and motor deficits ( numbness , tingling , or weakness in lower limbs ) , and bowel or bladder dysfunction .
Consider the potential risks and benefits before neuraxial intervention in patients anticoagulated or who may be anticoagulated for thromboprophylaxis .
5 . 2 Hemorrhage Fondaparinux sodium increases the risk of hemorrhage in patients at risk for bleeding , including conditions such as congenital or acquired bleeding disorders , active ulcerative and angiodysplastic gastrointestinal disease , hemorrhagic stroke , uncontrolled arterial hypertension , diabetic retinopathy , or shortly after brain , spinal , or ophthalmological surgery .
Cases of elevated aPTT temporally associated with bleeding events have been reported following administration of fondaparinux sodium ( with or without concomitant administration of other anticoagulants ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 5 ) ] .
Do not administer agents that enhance the risk of hemorrhage with fondaparinux sodium unless essential for the management of the underlying condition , such as vitamin K antagonists for the treatment of VTE .
If co - administration is essential , closely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of bleeding .
Do not administer the initial dose of fondaparinux sodium earlier than 6 to 8 hours after surgery .
Administration earlier than 6 hours after surgery increases risk of major bleeding [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 3 Renal Impairment and Bleeding Risk Fondaparinux sodium increases the risk of bleeding in patients with impaired renal function due to reduced clearance [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
The incidence of major bleeding by renal function status reported in clinical trials of patients receiving fondaparinux sodium for VTE surgical prophylaxis is provided in Table 1 .
In these patient populations , the following is recommended : • • Do not use fondaparinux sodium for VTE prophylaxis and treatment in patients with CrCl < 30 mL / min [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
• • Fondaparinux sodium may cause prolonged anticoagulation in patients with CrCl 30 to 50 mL / min .

Assess renal function periodically in patients receiving fondaparinux sodium .
Discontinue the drug immediately in patients who develop severe renal impairment while on therapy .
After discontinuation of fondaparinux sodium , its anticoagulant effects may persist for 2 to 4 days in patients with normal renal function ( i . e . , at least 3 to 5 half - lives ) .
The anticoagulant effects of fondaparinux sodium may persist even longer in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 4 Body Weight < 50 kg and Bleeding Risk Fondaparinux sodium increases the risk for bleeding in patients who weigh less than 50 kg , compared to patients with higher weights .
In patients who weigh less than 50 kg : • • Do not administer fondaparinux sodium as prophylactic therapy for patients undergoing hip fracture , hip replacement , or knee replacement surgery and abdominal surgery [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
During the randomized clinical trials of VTE prophylaxis in the peri - operative period following hip fracture , hip replacement , or knee replacement surgery and abdominal surgery , major bleeding occurred at a higher rate among patients with a body weight < 50 kg compared to those with a body weight > 50 kg ( 5 . 4 % versus 2 . 1 % in patients undergoing hip fracture , hip replacement , or knee replacement surgery ; 5 . 3 % versus 3 . 3 % in patients undergoing abdominal surgery ) .
5 . 5 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia can occur with the administration of fondaparinux sodium .
Thrombocytopenia of any degree should be monitored closely .
Discontinue fondaparinux sodium if the platelet count falls below 100 , 000 / mm3 .
Moderate thrombocytopenia ( platelet counts between 100 , 000 / mm3 and 50 , 000 / mm3 ) occurred at a rate of 3 . 0 % in patients given fondaparinux sodium 2 . 5 mg in the peri - operative hip fracture , hip replacement , or knee replacement surgery and abdominal surgery clinical trials .
Severe thrombocytopenia ( platelet counts less than 50 , 000 / mm3 ) occurred at a rate of 0 . 2 % in patients given fondaparinux sodium 2 . 5 mg in these clinical trials .
During extended prophylaxis , no cases of moderate or severe thrombocytopenia were reported .
Moderate thrombocytopenia occurred at a rate of 0 . 5 % in patients given the fondaparinux sodium treatment regimen in the DVT and PE treatment clinical trials .
Severe thrombocytopenia occurred at a rate of 0 . 04 % in patients given the fondaparinux sodium treatment regimen in the DVT and PE treatment clinical trials .
Occurrences of thrombocytopenia with thrombosis that manifested similar to heparin - induced thrombocytopenia have been reported with the use of fondaparinux sodium in postmarketing experience [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 5 ) ] .
5 . 6 Monitoring : Laboratory Tests Routine coagulation tests such as Prothrombin Time ( PT ) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) are relatively insensitive measures of the activity of fondaparinux sodium and international standards of heparin or LMWH are not calibrators to measure anti - Factor Xa activity of fondaparinux sodium .
If unexpected changes in coagulation parameters or major bleeding occur during therapy with fondaparinux sodium , discontinue fondaparinux sodium .
In postmarketing experience , occurrences of aPTT elevations have been reported following administration of fondaparinux sodium [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 5 ) ] .
Periodic routine complete blood counts ( including platelet count ) , serum creatinine level , and stool occult blood tests are recommended during the course of treatment with fondaparinux sodium .
The anti - Factor Xa activity of fondaparinux sodium can be measured by anti - Xa assay using the appropriate calibrator ( fondaparinux ) .
The activity of fondaparinux sodium is expressed in milligrams ( mg ) of the fondaparinux and cannot be compared with activities of heparin or low molecular weight heparins [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 , 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 7 Latex The packaging ( needle guard ) of the prefilled syringe of fondaparinux sodium injection contains dry natural latex rubber that may cause allergic reactions in latex sensitive individuals .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • • Spinal or epidural hematomas [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Hemorrhage [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • • Renal impairment and bleeding risk [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • • Body weight < 50 kg and bleeding risk [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • • Thrombocytopenia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] The most serious adverse reactions associated with the use of fondaparinux sodium are bleeding complications .

[ 2 ] Not approved for use in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery .
[ 3 ] Major bleeding was defined as clinically overt bleeding that was ( 1 ) fatal , ( 2 ) bleeding at critical site ( e . g . intracranial , retroperitoneal , intraocular , pericardial , spinal , or into adrenal gland ) , ( 3 ) associated with re - operation at operative site , or ( 4 ) with a bleeding index ( BI ) ≥ 2 .
[ 4 ] BI ≥ 2 : Overt bleeding associated only with a bleeding index ( BI ) ≥ 2 calculated as [ number of whole blood or packed red blood cell units transfused + [ ( pre - bleeding ) – ( post - bleeding ) ] hemoglobin ( g / dL ) values ] .
[ 5 ] Minor bleeding was defined as clinically overt bleeding that was not major .
A separate analysis of major bleeding across all randomized , controlled , peri - operative , prophylaxis clinical studies of hip fracture , hip replacement , or knee replacement surgery according to the time of the first injection of fondaparinux sodium after surgical closure was performed in patients who received fondaparinux sodium only post - operatively .
In this analysis , the incidences of major bleeding were as follows : < 4 hours was 4 . 8 % ( 5 / 104 ) , 4 to 6 hours was 2 . 3 % ( 28 / 1 , 196 ) , 6 to 8 hours was 1 . 9 % ( 38 / 1 , 965 ) .
In all studies , the majority ( ≥ 75 % ) of the major bleeding events occurred during the first 4 days after surgery .
Abdominal Surgery In a randomized study of patients undergoing abdominal surgery , fondaparinux sodium 2 . 5 mg once daily ( n = 1 , 433 ) was compared with dalteparin 5 , 000 IU once daily ( n = 1 , 425 ) .
Bleeding rates are shown in Table 3 .

[ 2 ] Minor bleeding was defined as clinically overt bleeding that was not major .
The rates of major bleeding according to the time interval following the first fondaparinux sodium injection were as follows : < 6 hours was 3 . 4 % ( 9 / 263 ) and 6 to 8 hours was 2 . 9 % ( 32 / 1112 ) .
Treatment of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism The rates of bleeding events reported during a dose - response trial ( n = 111 ) and an active - controlled trial with enoxaparin sodium in DVT treatment ( n = 1 , 091 ) and an active - controlled trial with heparin in PE treatment ( n = 1 , 092 ) with fondaparinux sodium are provided in Table 4 .

Patients were also treated with vitamin K antagonists initiated within 72 hours after the first study drug administration .
[ 2 ] Major bleeding was defined as clinically overt : – and / or contributing to death – and / or in a critical organ including intracranial , retroperitoneal , intraocular , spinal , pericardial , or adrenal gland – and / or associated with a fall in hemoglobin level ≥ 2 g / dL – and / or leading to a transfusion ≥ 2 units of packed red blood cells or whole blood .
[ 3 ] Clinically overt bleeding with a 2 g / dL fall in hemoglobin and / or leading to transfusion of PRBC or whole blood ≥ 2 units .
[ 4 ] Minor bleeding was defined as clinically overt bleeding that was not major .
6 . 2 Local Reactions Local irritation ( injection site bleeding , rash , and pruritus ) may occur following subcutaneous injection of fondaparinux sodium .
6 . 3 Elevations of Serum Aminotransferases In the peri - operative prophylaxis randomized clinical trials of 7 ± 2 days , asymptomatic increases in aspartate ( AST ) and alanine ( ALT ) aminotransferase levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal were reported in 1 . 7 % and 2 . 6 % of patients , respectively , during treatment with fondaparinux sodium 2 . 5 mg once daily versus 3 . 2 % and 3 . 9 % of patients , respectively , during treatment with enoxaparin sodium 30 mg every 12 hours or 40 mg once daily enoxaparin sodium .
These elevations are reversible and may be associated with increases in bilirubin .
In the extended prophylaxis clinical trial , no significant differences in AST and ALT levels between fondaparinux sodium 2 . 5 mg and placebo - treated patients were observed .
In the DVT and PE treatment clinical trials , asymptomatic increases in AST and ALT levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal of the laboratory reference range were reported in 0 . 7 % and 1 . 3 % of patients , respectively , during treatment with fondaparinux sodium .
In comparison , these increases were reported in 4 . 8 % and 12 . 3 % of patients , respectively , in the DVT treatment trial during treatment with enoxaparin sodium 1 mg / kg every 12 hours and in 2 . 9 % and 8 . 7 % of patients , respectively , in the PE treatment trial during treatment with aPTT adjusted heparin .
Since aminotransferase determinations are important in the differential diagnosis of myocardial infarction , liver disease , and pulmonary emboli , elevations that might be caused by drugs like fondaparinux sodium should be interpreted with caution .

[ 2 ] Not approved for use in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery .
[ 3 ] Localized blister coded as bullous eruption .
The most common adverse reaction in the abdominal surgery trial was post - operative wound infection ( 4 . 9 % ) , and the most common adverse reaction in the VTE treatment trials was epistaxis ( 1 . 3 % ) .
6 . 5 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of fondaparinux sodium .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
In the postmarketing experience , epidural or spinal hematoma has been reported in association with the use of fondaparinux sodium by subcutaneous ( SC ) injection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Occurrences of thrombocytopenia with thrombosis that manifested similar to heparin - induced thrombocytopenia have been reported in the postmarketing experience and cases of elevated aPTT temporally associated with bleeding events have been reported following administration of fondaparinux sodium ( with or without concomitant administration of other anticoagulants ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Serious allergic reactions , including angioedema , anaphylactoid / anaphylactic reactions have been reported with the use of fondaparinux sodium [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In clinical studies performed with fondaparinux sodium , the concomitant use of oral anticoagulants ( warfarin ) , platelet inhibitors ( acetylsalicylic acid ) , NSAIDs ( piroxicam ) , and digoxin did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics of fondaparinux sodium .
In addition , fondaparinux sodium neither influenced the pharmacodynamics of warfarin , acetylsalicylic acid , piroxicam , and digoxin , nor the pharmacokinetics of digoxin at steady state .
Agents that may enhance the risk of hemorrhage should be discontinued prior to initiation of therapy with fondaparinux sodium unless these agents are essential .
If co - administration is necessary , monitor patients closely for hemorrhage [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes , inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux ( 200 micromolar i . e . , 350 mg / L ) was 17 to 28 % .
Inhibition of the other isozymes evaluated ( CYPs 1A2 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 3A4 , and 3E1 ) was 0 to 16 % .
Since fondaparinux does not markedly inhibit CYP450s ( CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 , or CYP3A4 ) in vitro , fondaparinux sodium is not expected to significantly interact with other drugs in vivo by inhibition of metabolism mediated by these isozymes .
Since fondaparinux sodium does not bind significantly to plasma proteins other than ATIII , no drug interactions by protein - binding displacement are expected .
Discontinue agents that may enhance the risk of hemorrhage prior to initiation of therapy with fondaparinux sodium unless essential .
If co - administration is necessary , monitor patients closely for hemorrhage .
( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Safety and effectiveness of fondaparinux sodium in pediatric patients have not been established .
Because the risk for bleeding during treatment with fondaparinux sodium is increased in adults who weigh < 50 kg , bleeding may be a particular safety concern for use of fondaparinux sodium in the pediatric population .
( 4 , 5 . 4 ) • • Because elderly patients are more likely to have reduced renal function , fondaparinux sodium should be used with caution in these patients .
( 8 . 5 ) • • The risk of bleeding is increased with reduced renal or hepatic function .
( 8 . 6 , 8 . 7 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature and postmarketing reports have not reported a clear association with fondaparinux sodium and adverse developmental outcomes .
Fondaparinux sodium plasma concentrations obtained from four women treated with fondaparinux sodium injection during pregnancy and their newborn infants demonstrated low placental transfer of fondaparinux sodium ( see Data ) .
There are risks to the mother associated with untreated venous thromboembolism in pregnancy and a risk of hemorrhage in the mother and fetus associated with use of anticoagulants ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
In animal reproduction studies , there was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes when fondaparinux sodium was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 32 and 65 times , respectively , the recommended human dose based on body surface area .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk Pregnancy confers an increased risk for thromboembolism that is higher for women with underlying thromboembolic disease and certain high - risk pregnancy conditions .
Published data describe that women with a previous history of venous thrombosis are at high risk for recurrence during pregnancy .
Fetal / Neonatal adverse reactions Fondaparinux sodium has been demonstrated to cross the placenta in humans ( see Data ) .
Use of anticoagulants , including fondaparinux sodium , may increase the risk of bleeding in the fetus and neonate .
Monitor neonates for bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 4 , 5 . 6 ) ] .
Labor or delivery All patients receiving anticoagulants , including pregnant women , are at risk for bleeding .
Fondaparinux sodium use during labor or delivery in women who are receiving neuraxial anesthesia may result in epidural or spinal hematomas .
Pregnant women receiving fondaparinux sodium should be carefully monitored for evidence of bleeding or unexpected changes in coagulation parameters .
Consideration for use of a shorter acting anticoagulant should be specifically addressed as delivery approaches [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 6 ) ] .
Data Human Data In a study of five pregnant women treated with fondaparinux sodium during the third trimester of pregnancy at a dose of 2 . 5 mg / day , four of the women had elevated anti - factor Xa activity noted in the cord blood .
Anti - factor Xa clotting times in these four cases were between 37 . 5 and 50 . 9 seconds .
The patient who did not have elevated anti - factor Xa activity had received only one dose of fondaparinux sodium 22 hours prior to delivery .
The concentration of fondaparinux sodium in umbilical cord plasma was approximately 1 / 10 th the level of fondaparinux sodium in maternal plasma .
None of the infants experienced adverse effects .
Animal Data Embryo - fetal development studies have been conducted with fondaparinux sodium in pregnant rats at subcutaneous doses up to 10 mg / kg / day ( about 32 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) administered from days 6 to 17 of gestation and pregnant rabbits at subcutaneous doses up to 10 mg / kg / day ( about 65 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) administered from days 6 to 18 of gestation .
These studies have revealed no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes when fondaparinux sodium was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis .
Additionally , there were no effects on pre and postnatal development in a study conducted in rats at subcutaneous doses up to 10 mg / kg / day ( about 32 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of fondaparinux sodium in human milk , or the effects on milk production .
Limited clinical data during lactation preclude a clear determination of the risk of fondaparinux sodium to an infant during lactation ; therefore , the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for fondaparinux sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from fondaparinux sodium or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of fondaparinux sodium in pediatric patients have not been established .
Because risk for bleeding during treatment with fondaparinux sodium is increased in adults who weigh < 50 kg , bleeding may be a particular safety concern for use of fondaparinux sodium in the pediatric population [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In clinical trials the efficacy of fondaparinux sodium in the elderly ( 65 years or older ) was similar to that seen in patients younger than 65 years ; however , serious adverse events increased with age .
When using fondaparinux sodium in elderly patients , paying particular attention to dosing directions and concomitant medications ( especially anti - platelet medication ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Fondaparinux sodium is substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of adverse reactions to fondaparinux sodium may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , assess renal function prior to fondaparinux sodium administration [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
In the peri - operative hip fracture , hip replacement , or knee replacement surgery clinical trials with patients receiving fondaparinux sodium 2 . 5 mg , serious adverse events increased with age for patients receiving fondaparinux sodium .
The incidence of major bleeding in clinical trials of fondaparinux sodium by age is provided in Table 6 .

8 . 6 Renal Impairment Patients with impaired renal function are at increased risk of bleeding due to reduced clearance of fondaparinux sodium [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Assess renal function periodically in patients receiving fondaparinux sodium .
Discontinue fondaparinux sodium immediately in patients who develop severe renal impairment while on therapy .
After discontinuation of fondaparinux sodium , its anticoagulant effects may persist for 2 to 4 days in patients with normal renal function ( i . e . , at least 3 to 5 half - lives ) .
The anticoagulant effects of fondaparinux sodium may persist even longer in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Following a single , subcutaneous dose of 7 . 5 mg of fondaparinux sodium in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Category B ) compared to subjects with normal liver function , changes from baseline in aPTT , PT / INR , and antithrombin III were similar in the two groups .
However , a higher incidence of hemorrhage was observed in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment than in normal subjects , especially mild hematomas at the blood sampling or injection site .
The pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known antidote for fondaparinux sodium .
Overdose of fondaparinux sodium may lead to hemorrhagic complications .
Discontinue treatment and initiate appropriate therapy if bleeding complications associated with overdosage occur .
Data obtained in patients undergoing chronic intermittent hemodialysis suggest that clearance of fondaparinux sodium can increase by 20 % during hemodialysis .
11 DESCRIPTION Fondaparinux sodium injection , USP is a sterile solution containing fondaparinux sodium .
It is a synthetic and specific inhibitor of activated Factor X ( Xa ) .
Fondaparinux sodium is methyl O - 2 - deoxy - 6 - O - sulfo - 2 - ( sulfoamino ) - α - D - glucopyranosyl - ( 1 → 4 ) - O - β - D - glucopyra - nuronosyl - ( 1 → 4 ) - O - 2 - deoxy - 3 , 6 - di - O - sulfo - 2 - ( sulfoamino ) - α - D - glucopyranosyl - ( 1 → 4 ) - O - 2 - O - sulfo - α - L - idopyranuronosyl - ( 1 → 4 ) - 2 - deoxy - 6 - O - sulfo - 2 - ( sulfoamino ) - α - D - glucopyranoside , decasodium salt .
The molecular formula of fondaparinux sodium is C31H43N3Na10O49S8 and its molecular weight is 1728 .
The structural formula is provided below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Fondaparinux sodium injection is supplied as a sterile , preservative - free injectable solution for subcutaneous use .
Each single - dose , prefilled syringe of fondaparinux sodium injection , affixed with an automatic needle protection system , contains 2 . 5 mg of fondaparinux sodium in 0 . 5 mL , 5 . 0 mg of fondaparinux sodium in 0 . 4 mL , 7 . 5 mg of fondaparinux sodium in 0 . 6 mL , or 10 . 0 mg of fondaparinux sodium in 0 . 8 mL of an isotonic solution of sodium chloride and water for injection .
May also contain sodium hydroxide and / or hydrochloric acid as pH adjusters .
The final drug product is a clear and colorless to slightly yellow liquid with a pH between 5 . 0 and 8 . 0 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The antithrombotic activity of fondaparinux sodium is the result of antithrombin III ( ATIII ) - mediated selective inhibition of Factor Xa .
By selectively binding to ATIII , fondaparinux sodium potentiates ( about 300 times ) the innate neutralization of Factor Xa by ATIII .
Neutralization of Factor Xa interrupts the blood coagulation cascade and thus inhibits thrombin formation and thrombus development .
Fondaparinux sodium does not inactivate thrombin ( activated Factor II ) and has no known effect on platelet function .
At the recommended dose , fondaparinux sodium does not affect fibrinolytic activity or bleeding time .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Anti - Xa Activity The pharmacodynamics / pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux sodium are derived from fondaparinux plasma concentrations quantified via anti - Factor Xa activity .
Only fondaparinux can be used to calibrate the anti - Xa assay .
( The international standards of heparin or LMWH are not appropriate for this use . )
As a result , the activity of fondaparinux sodium is expressed as milligrams ( mg ) of the fondaparinux calibrator .
The anti - Xa activity of the drug increases with increasing drug concentration , reaching maximum values in approximately three hours .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Fondaparinux sodium administered by subcutaneous injection is rapidly and completely absorbed ( absolute bioavailability is 100 % ) .
Following a single subcutaneous dose of fondaparinux sodium 2 . 5 mg in young male subjects , Cmax of 0 . 34 mg / L is reached in approximately 2 hours .
In patients undergoing treatment with fondaparinux sodium injection 2 . 5 mg , once daily , the peak steady - state plasma concentration is , on average , 0 . 39 to 0 . 50 mg / L and is reached approximately 3 hours post - dose .
In these patients , the minimum steady - state plasma concentration is 0 . 14 to 0 . 19 mg / L .
In patients with symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism undergoing treatment with fondaparinux sodium injection 5 mg ( body weight < 50 kg ) , 7 . 5 mg ( body weight 50 to 100 kg ) , and 10 mg ( body weight > 100 kg ) once daily , the body – weight - adjusted doses provide similar mean steady - state peaks and minimum plasma concentrations across all body weight categories .
The mean peak steady - state plasma concentration is in the range of 1 . 20 to 1 . 26 mg / L .
In these patients , the mean minimum steady - state plasma concentration is in the range of 0 . 46 to 0 . 62 mg / L .
Distribution In healthy adults , intravenously or subcutaneously administered fondaparinux sodium distributes mainly in blood and only to a minor extent in extravascular fluid as evidenced by steady state and non - steady state apparent volume of distribution of 7 to 11 L . Similar fondaparinux distribution occurs in patients undergoing elective hip surgery or hip fracture surgery .
In vitro , fondaparinux sodium is highly ( at least 94 % ) and specifically bound to antithrombin III ( ATIII ) and does not bind significantly to other plasma proteins ( including platelet Factor 4 [ PF4 ] ) or red blood cells .
Metabolism In vivo metabolism of fondaparinux has not been investigated since the majority of the administered dose is eliminated unchanged in urine in individuals with normal kidney function .
Elimination In individuals with normal kidney function , fondaparinux is eliminated in urine mainly as unchanged drug .
In healthy individuals up to 75 years of age , up to 77 % of a single subcutaneous or intravenous fondaparinux dose is eliminated in urine as unchanged drug in 72 hours .
The elimination half - life is 17 to 21 hours .
12 . 4 Special Populations Renal Impairment Fondaparinux elimination is prolonged in patients with renal impairment since the major route of elimination is urinary excretion of unchanged drug .
In patients undergoing prophylaxis following elective hip surgery or hip fracture surgery , the total clearance of fondaparinux is approximately 25 % lower in patients with mild renal impairment ( CrCl 50 to 80 mL / min ) , approximately 40 % lower in patients with moderate renal impairment ( CrCl 30 to 50 mL / min ) , and approximately 55 % lower in patients with severe renal impairment ( < 30 mL / min ) compared to patients with normal renal function .
A similar relationship between fondaparinux clearance and extent of renal impairment was observed in DVT treatment patients [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Hepatic Impairment Following a single , subcutaneous dose of 7 . 5 mg of fondaparinux sodium in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Category B ) , Cmax and AUC were decreased by 22 % and 39 % , respectively , compared to subjects with normal liver function .
The changes from baseline in pharmacodynamic parameters , such as aPTT , PT / INR , and antithrombin III , were similar in normal subjects and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment .
Based on these data , no dosage adjustment is recommended in these patients .
However , a higher incidence of hemorrhage was observed in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment than in normal subjects [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
The pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux have not been investigated in pediatric patients [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) , and Pediatric Use ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Geriatric Fondaparinux elimination is prolonged in patients older than 75 years .
In studies evaluating fondaparinux sodium 2 . 5 mg prophylaxis in hip fracture surgery or elective hip surgery , the total clearance of fondaparinux was approximately 25 % lower in patients older than 75 years as compared to patients younger than 65 years .
A similar relationship between fondaparinux clearance and age was observed in DVT treatment patients [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Patients Weighing Less Than 50 kg Total clearance of fondaparinux sodium is decreased by approximately 30 % in patients weighing less than 50 kg [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Gender The pharmacokinetic properties of fondaparinux sodium are not significantly affected by gender .
Race Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied prospectively .
However , studies performed in Asian ( Japanese ) healthy subjects did not reveal a different pharmacokinetic profile compared to Caucasian healthy subjects .
Similarly , no plasma clearance differences were observed between black and Caucasian patients undergoing orthopedic surgery .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No long - term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of fondaparinux sodium .
Fondaparinux sodium was not genotoxic in the Ames test , the mouse lymphoma cell ( L5178Y / TK + / - ) forward mutation test , the human lymphocyte chromosome aberration test , the rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis ( UDS ) test , or the rat micronucleus test .
At subcutaneous doses up to 10 mg / kg / day ( about 32 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) , fondaparinux sodium was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Prophylaxis of Thromboembolic Events Following Hip Fracture Surgery In a randomized , double - blind , clinical trial in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery , fondaparinux sodium 2 . 5 mg SC once daily was compared to enoxaparin sodium 40 mg SC once daily , which is not approved for use in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery .
A total of 1 , 711 patients were randomized and 1 , 673 were treated .
Patients ranged in age from 17 to 101 years ( mean age 77 years ) with 25 % men and 75 % women .
Patients were 99 % Caucasian , 1 % other races .
Patients with multiple traumas affecting more than one organ system , serum creatinine level more than 2 mg / dL ( 180 micromol / L ) , or platelet count less than 100 , 000 / mm3 were excluded from the trial .
Fondaparinux sodium was initiated after surgery in 88 % of patients ( mean 6 hours ) and enoxaparin sodium was initiated after surgery in 74 % of patients ( mean 18 hours ) .
For both drugs , treatment was continued for 7 ± 2 days .
The primary efficacy endpoint , venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) , was a composite of documented deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) and / or documented symptomatic pulmonary embolism ( PE ) reported up to Day 11 .
The efficacy data are provided in Table 7 and demonstrate that under the conditions of the trial fondaparinux sodium was associated with a VTE rate of 8 . 3 % compared with a VTE rate of 19 . 1 % for enoxaparin sodium for a relative risk reduction of 56 % ( 95 % CI : 39 % , 70 % ; P < 0 . 001 ) .
Major bleeding episodes occurred in 2 . 2 % of patients receiving fondaparinux sodium and 2 . 3 % of enoxaparin sodium patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .

14 . 2 Extended Prophylaxis of Thromboembolic Events Following Hip Fracture Surgery In a noncomparative , unblinded manner , 737 patients undergoing hip fracture surgery were initially treated during the peri - operative period with fondaparinux sodium 2 . 5 mg once daily for 7 ± 1 days .
Eighty - one ( 81 ) of the 737 patients were not eligible for randomization into the 3 ‑ week double - blind period .
Three hundred twenty - six ( 326 ) patients and 330 patients were randomized to receive fondaparinux sodium 2 . 5 mg once daily or placebo , respectively , in or out of the hospital for 21 ± 2 days .
Patients ranged in age from 23 to 96 years ( mean age 75 years ) and were 29 % men and 71 % women .
Patients were 99 % Caucasian and 1 % other races .
Patients with multiple traumas affecting more than one organ system or serum creatinine level more than 2 mg / dL ( 180 micromol / L ) were excluded from the trial .
The primary efficacy endpoint , venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) , was a composite of documented deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) and / or documented symptomatic pulmonary embolism ( PE ) reported for up to 24 days following randomization .
The efficacy data are provided in Table 8 and demonstrate that extended prophylaxis with fondaparinux sodium was associated with a VTE rate of 1 . 4 % compared with a VTE rate of 35 . 0 % for placebo for a relative risk reduction of 95 . 9 % ( 95 % CI = [ 98 . 7 ; 87 . 1 ] , P < 0 . 0001 ) .
Major bleeding rates during the 3 - week extended prophylaxis period for fondaparinux sodium occurred in 2 . 4 % of patients receiving fondaparinux sodium and 0 . 6 % of placebo - treated patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .

14 . 3 Prophylaxis of Thromboembolic Events Following Hip Replacement Surgery In 2 randomized , double - blind , clinical trials in patients undergoing hip replacement surgery , fondaparinux sodium 2 . 5 mg SC once daily was compared to either enoxaparin sodium 30 mg SC every 12 hours ( Study 1 ) or to enoxaparin sodium 40 mg SC once a day ( Study 2 ) .
In Study 1 , a total of 2 , 275 patients were randomized and 2 , 257 were treated .
Patients ranged in age from 18 to 92 years ( mean age 65 years ) with 48 % men and 52 % women .
Patients were 94 % Caucasian , 4 % black , < 1 % Asian , and 2 % others .
In Study 2 , a total of 2 , 309 patients were randomized and 2 , 273 were treated .
Patients ranged in age from 24 to 97 years ( mean age 65 years ) with 42 % men and 58 % women .
Patients were 99 % Caucasian , and 1 % other races .
