MECHANISM OF ACTION : Vitamin B12 [ TREATMENT ] ; FOLATE [ PREVENTION ] ; OTHER [ SUPPLEMENTATION ] ; iNDICATIONS : EnBrace ® HR is indicated in the TREATMENT of vitamin deficiency - specifically vitamin B12 deficiency , and the PREVENTION of vitamin B12 - cofactor deficiency , l - methylfolate .
Requirements of vitamin B9 and / or vitamin B12 in excess of normal due to pregnancy can usually be met with oral supplementation .
PRECAUTIONS : GENERAL : 0 . 1 mg or more of folic acid daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that the hematological remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive .
The safe tolerable limit for folic acid ( in preparations ) is 1 mg [ emphasis added ] .
Folic acid is not a substitute for vitamin B12 - although it may improve vitamin B12 - deficient megaloblastic anemia .
Exclusive use of folic acid in treating vitamin B12 - deficient megaloblastic anemia could result in progressive and irreversible neurologic damage .
Specifically , vitamin B12 deficiency allowed to progress over 3 months may produce permanent degenerative lesions of the spinal cord - as observed when folate therapy is used as the only hematopoietic agent .
Doses of vitamin B12 exceeding 10 mcg daily may produce hematologic response in patients with folate deficiency .
Indiscriminate administration may mask the true diagnosis .
A dietary deficiency of only vitamin B12 is rare ; multiple vitamin deficiency is expected in any dietary deficiency .
No single regimen fits all cases , and the status of the patient observed in follow - up is the final criterion for adequacy of therapy .
DRUG INTERACTIONS : Colchicine , para - aminosalicylic acid , and heavy alcohol intake for longer than 2 weeks may produce malabsorption of vitamin B12 .
CARCINOGENESIS , MUTAGENESIS , IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY : There is no evidence from long - term use in patients with pernicious anemia that vitamin B12 or folate is carcinogenic .
Pernicious anemia is associated with increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach , but this is believed to be related to the underlying pathology and not to treatment with vitamin B12 .
PREGNANCY , NURSING MOTHERS , PEDIATRIC USE : Vitamin B9 and vitamin B12 are essential vitamins and requirements are increased during pregnancy .
Amounts of vitamin B9 and vitamin B12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board , National Academy of Science - National Research Council for lactating women should be consumed during pregnancy .
Vitamin B12 and vitamin B9 appear in the milk of nursing mothers in concentrations which approximate the mother ’ s vitamin B12 and vitamin B9 blood level .
Amounts of vitamin B12 that are recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board , National Academies of Science - National Research Council for lactating women should be consumed during lactation .
Intake in pediatric patients should be in the amount recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board , National Academy of Science - National Research Council .
ADVERSE REACTIONS : Mild transient diarrhea , polycythemia vera , itching , transitory exanthema , feeling of swelling of entire body may occur with administration of vitamin B12 .
Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid .
