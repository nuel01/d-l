Adult CMV - seropositive Recipients [ R + ] of an Allogeneic HSCT The safety of PREVYMIS was evaluated in one Phase 3 randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial ( P001 ) in which 565 subjects were randomized and treated with PREVYMIS ( N = 373 ) or placebo ( N = 192 ) through Week 14 post - transplant .
Adverse events were those reported while subjects were on study medication or within two weeks of study medication completion / discontinuation .
The mean time for reporting adverse events and laboratory abnormalities was approximately 22 % longer in the PREVYMIS arm compared to the placebo arm .
Cardiac Adverse Events : The cardiac adverse event rate ( regardless of investigator - assessed causality ) was higher in subjects receiving PREVYMIS ( 13 % ) compared to subjects receiving placebo ( 6 % ) .
The most common cardiac adverse events were tachycardia ( reported in 4 % of PREVYMIS subjects and in 2 % of placebo subjects ) and atrial fibrillation ( reported in 3 % of PREVYMIS subjects and in 1 % of placebo subjects ) .
Among those subjects who experienced one or more cardiac adverse events , 85 % of PREVYMIS and 92 % of placebo subjects had events reported as mild or moderate in severity .
Common Adverse Events The rate of adverse events occurring in at least 10 % of subjects in the PREVYMIS group and at a frequency at least 2 % greater than placebo are outlined in Table 1 .
Table 1 : Trial P001 All Grade Adverse Events Reported in ≥ 10 % of PREVYMIS - Treated HSCT Recipients at a Frequency at least 2 % Greater than PlaceboAdverse Events PREVYMIS ( N = 373 ) Placebo ( N = 192 ) nausea 27 % 23 % diarrhea 26 % 24 % vomiting 19 % 14 % peripheral edema 14 % 9 % cough 14 % 10 % headache 14 % 9 % fatigue 13 % 11 % abdominal pain 12 % 9 % Overall , similar proportions of subjects in each group discontinued study medication due to an adverse event ( 13 % of PREVYMIS subjects vs . 12 % of placebo subjects ) .
The most frequently reported adverse event that led to study drug discontinuation was nausea , occurring in 2 % of PREVYMIS subjects and 1 % of placebo subjects .
Hypersensitivity reaction , with associated moderate dyspnea , occurred in one subject following the first infusion of IV PREVYMIS after switching from oral PREVYMIS , leading to treatment discontinuation .
Laboratory Abnormalities Selected laboratory abnormalities reported during treatment or within 2 weeks of stopping treatment are presented in the table below .

( 8 . 6 ) • Hepatic Impairment : PREVYMIS is not recommended for patients with severe ( Child - Pugh C ) hepatic impairment .
( 8 . 7 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary No adequate human data are available to establish whether PREVYMIS poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , embryo - fetal developmental toxicity ( including fetal malformations ) was observed in rats during the period of organogenesis at letermovir exposures ( AUC ) 11 times higher than human exposure at the recommended human dose ( RHD ) .
In rabbits , no embryo - fetal developmental toxicity was noted at exposures that were not maternally toxic ( up to letermovir exposures 2 times higher than human exposure at the RHD ) .
In a rat pre / post - natal development study , total litter loss was observed at maternal letermovir exposures approximately 2 times higher than human exposure at the RHD ( see Data ) .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Letermovir was administered orally to pregnant rats at 0 , 10 , 50 or 250 mg / kg / day from gestation days 6 to 17 .
Developmental toxicities , including skeletal malformations and umbilical cord shortening , were observed at 250 mg / kg / day ( approximately 11 times higher than human exposure at the RHD ) .
In addition , decreased fetal body weight and skeletal variations ( due to maternal toxicity ) were observed at this dose .
No embryo - fetal toxicities were observed at 50 mg / kg / day ( approximately 3 times higher than human exposure at the RHD ) .
Letermovir was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at 0 , 25 , 75 or 225 mg / kg / day from gestation days 6 to 20 .
Developmental toxicities , including spontaneous abortion , increased post - implantation loss , and skeletal variations , were observed at a maternally toxic dose ( 225 mg / kg / day ; approximately 2 times higher than human exposure at the RHD ) .
No embryo - fetal toxicities were observed at 75 mg / kg / day ( less than human exposure at the RHD ) .
In the pre / post - natal development study , letermovir was administered orally to pregnant rats at 0 , 10 , 45 or 180 mg / kg / day from gestation day 6 to lactation day 22 .
At 180 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 times higher than human exposure at the RHD ) , total litter loss due to stillbirth or possible maternal neglect was observed in 5 of 23 pregnant females by post - partum / lactation day 4 .
In surviving offspring , slight developmental delays in vaginal opening and pinna unfolding were accompanied by reduced body weight gain at this dose .
No toxicities were observed at 45 mg / kg / day ( similar to human exposure at the RHD ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether letermovir is present in human breast milk , affects human milk production , or has effects on the breastfed child .
When administered to lactating rats , letermovir was present in the milk of lactating rats as well as the blood of nursing pups ( see Data ) .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for PREVYMIS and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from PREVYMIS or from the underlying maternal condition .
Data In a lactation study , letermovir was excreted in milk when administered intravenously ( at 10 mg / kg ) to lactating rats on post - partum / lactation day 10 .
Letermovir was also detected in the blood of nursing pups on post - partum / lactation day 21 in the pre / post - natal developmental study .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility There are no data on the effect of letermovir on human fertility .
Decreased fertility due to testicular toxicity was observed in male rats [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 , 13 . 2 ) ] .

12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a thorough QT trial in healthy subjects , letermovir at the therapeutic IV dose or at a dose of 2 times the approved IV dose did not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic properties of letermovir are displayed in Table 4 .

The meal administered was a standard high fat and high calorie meal ( 33 grams protein , 65 grams carbohydrates , 58 grams fat ; 920 total calories ) .
[ 4 ] Single oral administration of radiolabeled letermovir in mass balance study .
Specific Populations Pediatric Population The pharmacokinetics of letermovir in patients less than 18 years of age have not been evaluated .
Age , Gender , Race , and Weight Age ( 18 to 78 years ) , gender , race ( White vs . non - White ) , and body weight ( up to 100 kg ) did not have a clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of letermovir .
Renal Impairment Letermovir AUC was approximately 1 . 9 - and 1 . 4 - fold higher in subjects with moderate ( eGFR greater than or equal to 30 to 59 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) and severe ( eGFR less than 30 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) renal impairment , respectively , compared to healthy subjects .
Hydroxypropyl betadex present in the intravenous letermovir formulation is mainly eliminated by glomerular filtration .
Decreased elimination of hydroxypropyl betadex has been reported in the literature in patients with severe renal impairment .
Hepatic Impairment Letermovir AUC was approximately 1 . 6 - and 3 . 8 - fold higher in subjects with moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B [ CP - B ] , score of 7 - 9 ) and severe ( Child - Pugh Class C [ CP - C ] , score of 10 - 15 ) hepatic impairment , respectively , compared to healthy subjects .
Drug Interaction Studies Drug interaction studies were performed in healthy subjects with PREVYMIS and drugs likely to be co - administered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interactions ( see Table 5 and Table 6 ) .
In vitro results indicate that letermovir is a substrate of drug metabolizing enzymes CYP3A , CYP2D6 , UGT1A1 , and UGT1A3 , and transporters OATP1B1 / 3 and P - gp .
Oxidative metabolism is considered to be a minor elimination pathway based on in vivo human data .
Inhibitors of OATP1B1 / 3 may result in increases in letermovir plasma concentrations .
Changes in letermovir plasma concentrations due to inhibition of P - gp / BCRP by itraconazole were not clinically relevant .
Changes in letermovir plasma concentrations due to inhibition of UGTs are not anticipated to be clinically relevant .
Based on in vitro studies , the metabolism of letermovir is not mediated by CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C18 , CYP2C19 , CYP2E1 , CYP4A11 , UGT1A4 , UGT1A6 , UGT1A7 , UGT1A8 , UGT1A9 , UGT1A10 , UGT2B4 , UGT2B7 , UGT2B15 , or UGT2B17 .
The transport of letermovir is not mediated by OATP2B1 , OCT1 , OAT1 , BCRP , or MRP2 in vitro .
Letermovir is a time - dependent inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A in vitro .
Co - administration of PREVYMIS with midazolam resulted in increased exposure of midazolam , indicating that the net effect of letermovir on CYP3A is moderate inhibition ( see Table 6 ) .
Based on these results , co - administration of PREVYMIS with CYP3A substrates may increase the plasma concentrations of the CYP3A substrates [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 , 7 . 3 ) , and Table 3 ] .
Letermovir is a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro .
When co - administered with PREVYMIS , plasma concentrations of CYP2C8 substrates are predicted to be increased [ see Table 3 in Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
Co - administration of PREVYMIS reduced the exposure of voriconazole , most likely due to the induction of voriconazole elimination pathways , CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 .
Co - administration of PREVYMIS with CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 substrates may decrease the plasma concentrations of the CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 substrates [ see Table 3 in Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
Letermovir is an inducer of CYP2B6 in vitro ; the clinical relevance is unknown .
Letermovir inhibited efflux transporters P - gp , breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) , bile salt export pump ( BSEP ) , multidrug resistance - associated protein 2 ( MRP2 ) , OAT3 , and hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1 / 3 in vitro .
Co - administration of PREVYMIS with substrates of OATP1B1 / 3 transporters ( e . g . atorvastatin , a known substrate of CYP3A , OATP1B1 / 3 , and potentially BCRP ) may result in a clinically relevant increase in plasma concentrations of OATP1B1 / 3 substrates [ see Table 3 in Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
There were no clinically relevant changes in plasma concentrations of digoxin , a P - gp substrate , or acyclovir , an OAT3 substrate , following co - administration with PREVYMIS in clinical studies ( see Table 6 ) .
The effect of letermovir on BCRP , BSEP , and MRP2 substrates was not evaluated in clinical studies ; the clinical relevance is unknown .
Based on in vitro results letermovir is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 , UGT1A4 , UGT1A6 , UGT1A9 , or UGT2B7 and is not an inducer of CYP1A2 .
Letermovir is not an inhibitor of OATP2B1 , OCT1 , OCT2 , or OAT1 in vitro .

12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Letermovir inhibits the CMV DNA terminase complex ( pUL51 , pUL56 , and pUL89 ) which is required for viral DNA processing and packaging .
Biochemical characterization and electron microscopy demonstrated that letermovir affects the production of proper unit length genomes and interferes with virion maturation .
Genotypic characterization of virus resistant to letermovir confirmed that letermovir targets the terminase complex .
Antiviral Activity The median EC50 value of letermovir against a collection of clinical CMV isolates in a cell - culture model of infection was 2 . 1 nM ( range = 0 . 7 nM to 6 . 1 nM , n = 74 ) .
There was no significant difference in EC50 value by CMV gB genotype ( gB1 = 29 ; gB2 = 27 ; gB3 = 11 ; and gB4 = 3 ) .
Combination Antiviral Activity No antagonism of the antiviral activity was seen when letermovir was combined with CMV DNA polymerase inhibitors ( cidofovir , foscarnet , or ganciclovir ) .
Viral Resistance In Cell Culture CMV mutants with reduced susceptibility to letermovir have been selected in cell culture and the resistance mutations map to UL51 , UL56 , and UL89 .
Resistance - associated substitutions were found in pUL51 ( P91S ) , pUL56 ( C25F , S229F , V231A / L , N232Y , V236A / L / M , E237D , L241P , T244K / R , L254F , L257F / I , K258E , F261C / L / S , Y321C , C325F / R / W / Y , L328V , M329T , A365S , N368D , R369G / M / S ) , and pUL89 ( N320H , D344E ) .
EC50 values for recombinant CMV mutants expressing these substitutions are 1 . 6 - to 9 , 300 - fold higher than those for the wild - type reference virus .
In Clinical Studies In a Phase 2 b trial evaluating letermovir or placebo in 131 HSCT recipients , DNA sequence analysis of a select region of UL56 ( amino acids 231 to 369 ) was performed on samples obtained from 12 letermovir - treated subjects who experienced prophylaxis failure and for whom on - treatment samples were available for analysis .
One subject had a letermovir resistance substitution , pUL56 V236M .
In a Phase 3 trial ( P001 ) , DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding regions of UL56 and UL89 was performed on samples obtained from 50 letermovir - treated subjects who had received at least one dose of study drug and experienced prophylaxis failure and for whom samples were available for analysis .
The pUL56 substitutions V236M , E237G , C325W , and R369T were detected in 3 subjects ; however , no 2 subjects had substitutions at the same positions .
Cross Resistance Cross resistance is not likely with drugs outside of this class .
Letermovir is fully active against viral populations with substitutions conferring resistance to CMV DNA polymerase inhibitors ( cidofovir , foscarnet , and ganciclovir ) .
These DNA polymerase inhibitors are expected to be fully active against viral populations with substitutions conferring resistance to letermovir .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis Letermovir was not genotoxic in in vitro or in vivo assays , including microbial mutagenesis assays , chromosomal aberration in Chinese hamster ovary cells , and in an in vivo mouse micronucleus study .
Carcinogenicity studies with letermovir have not been conducted .
Impairment of Fertility In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats , no effects of letermovir on female fertility were observed at letermovir exposures ( AUC ) approximately 5 times higher than human exposure at the RHD .
In male rat fertility studies , decreased fertility associated with irreversible testicular toxicity was observed at ≥ 180 mg / kg / day ( greater than or equal to 3 times the human exposure at the RHD ) .
No fertility or testicular effects were observed at dose levels resulting in letermovir exposures ( AUC ) similar to human exposure at the RHD [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 2 ) ] .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Testicular toxicity in rats observed at ≥ 180 mg / kg / day ( greater than or equal to 3 times the human exposure at the RHD ) was characterized by decreased testis weight , bilateral seminiferous tubular degeneration , decreased sperm count and motility , and resultant decreased male fertility .
Male reproductive system toxicities were not observed in either a monkey testicular toxicity study up to 240 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 times higher than human exposure at the RHD ) , or a general toxicology study in mice up to 250 mg / kg / day ( approximately 3 times higher than human exposure at the RHD ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Adult CMV - seropositive Recipients [ R + ] of an Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant To evaluate PREVYMIS prophylaxis as a preventive strategy for CMV infection or disease in transplant recipients at high risk for CMV reactivation , the efficacy of PREVYMIS was assessed in a multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled Phase 3 Trial ( P001 , NCT02137772 ) in adult CMV - seropositive recipients [ R + ] of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) .
Subjects were randomized ( 2 : 1 ) to receive either PREVYMIS at a dose of 480 mg once daily adjusted to 240 mg when co - administered with cyclosporine , or placebo .
Randomization was stratified by investigational site and risk level for CMV reactivation at the time of study entry .
Study drug was initiated after HSCT ( at any time from Day 0 to Day 28 post - transplant ) and continued through Week 14 post - transplant .
Study drug was administered either orally or intravenously ; the dose of PREVYMIS was the same regardless of the route of administration .
Subjects received CMV DNA monitoring weekly until post - transplant Week 14 and then bi - weekly until post - transplant Week 24 , with initiation of standard - of - care CMV pre - emptive therapy if CMV viremia was considered clinically significant .
Subjects had continued follow - up through Week 48 post - transplant .
Among the 565 treated subjects , 70 subjects were found to have CMV viremia prior to study drug initiation and were therefore excluded from the efficacy analyses .
The efficacy population consisted of 325 subjects who received PREVYMIS ( including 91 subjects who received at least one IV dose ) and 170 who received placebo ( including 41 subjects who received at least one IV dose ) .
The IV formulation of PREVYMIS was used at investigators ' discretion in subjects who were unable to take oral therapy ( e . g . , unable to tolerate oral intake ) .
The median time to starting study drug was 8 days after transplantation .
Thirty - four percent ( 34 % ) of subjects were engrafted at baseline .
The median age was 55 years ( range : 18 to 76 years ) ; 57 % were male ; 84 % were White ; 9 % were Asian ; 2 % were Black or African American ; and 7 % were Hispanic or Latino .
At baseline , 30 % of all subjects had one or more of the following factors associated with increased risk for CMV reactivation ( high risk stratum ) : Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) - related donor with at least one mismatch at one of the following three HLA - gene loci : HLA - A , - B or – DR ; haploidentical donor ; unrelated donor with at least one mismatch at one of the following four HLA - gene loci : HLA - A , - B , - C and - DRB1 ; use of umbilical cord blood as stem cell source ; use of ex vivo T - cell - depleted grafts ; Grade 2 or greater Graft - Versus - Host Disease ( GVHD ) requiring systemic corticosteroids .
The remaining 70 % of subjects did not meet any of these high risk stratum criteria and were therefore included in the low risk stratum .
Additionally , 48 % of subjects received a myeloablative regimen , 51 % were receiving cyclosporine , and 43 % were receiving tacrolimus .
The most common primary reasons for transplant were acute myeloid leukemia ( 38 % ) , myelodysplastic syndrome ( 16 % ) , and lymphoma ( 12 % ) .
Clinically Significant CMV Infection The primary efficacy endpoint of Trial P001 was the incidence of clinically significant CMV infection through Week 24 post - transplant ( prophylaxis failure ) .
Clinically significant CMV infection was defined as the occurrence of either CMV end - organ disease , or initiation of anti - CMV pre - emptive therapy ( PET ) based on documented CMV viremia ( using the Roche COBAS ® AmpliPrep / COBAS TaqMan ® assay , LLoQ is 137 IU / mL , which is approximately 150 copies / mL ) and the clinical condition of the subject .
The protocol - specified guidance for CMV DNA thresholds for the initiation of PET during the treatment period was ≥ 150 copies / mL or > 300 copies / mL for subjects in the high and low risk strata , respectively .
From Week 14 through Week 24 , the threshold was > 300 copies / mL for both high and low risk strata subjects .
The Non - Completer = Failure ( NC = F ) approach was used , where subjects who discontinued from the trial prior to Week 24 post - transplant or had a missing outcome at Week 24 post - transplant were counted as failures .
Efficacy results from Trial P001 are shown in Table 7 .
Table 7 : Trial P001 Efficacy Results in HSCT Recipients ( NC = F Approach , FAS Population ) Through Week 24 Parameter Letermovir ( N = 325 ) Placebo ( N = 170 ) Note : FAS = Full analysis set ; FAS includes randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication , and excludes subjects with detectable CMV DNA at baseline .
Approach to handling missing values : Non - Completer = Failure ( NC = F ) approach .
With NC = F approach , failure was defined as all subjects who developed clinically significant CMV infection or prematurely discontinued from the study or had a missing outcome through Week 24 post - transplant visit window .
Proportion of subjects who failed prophylaxis 38 % 61 % Reasons for failures [ 1 ] Clinically significant CMV infection by Week 24 [ 2 ] 18 % 42 % Initiation of PET based on documented CMV viremia 16 % 40 % CMV end - organ disease 2 % 2 % Discontinued from study before Week 24 [ 3 ] 17 % 16 % Missing outcome in Week 24 visit window 3 % 3 % Stratum - adjusted treatment difference ( Letermovir - Placebo ) [ 4 ] Difference ( 95 % CI ) - 23 . 5 ( - 32 . 5 , - 14 . 6 ) [ 5 ] [ 1 ] The categories of failure are mutually exclusive and based on the hierarchy of categories in the order listed .
[ 2 ] Through Week 14 , 8 % of subjects in the PREVYMIS group and 39 % of subjects in the placebo group experienced clinically significant CMV infection .
[ 3 ] Reasons for discontinuation included adverse event , death , lost to follow - up , physician decision , and withdrawal by subject .
[ 4 ] 95 % CI and p - value for the treatment differences in percent response were calculated using stratum - adjusted Mantel - Haenszel method with the difference weighted by the harmonic mean of sample size per arm for each stratum ( high or low risk ) .
[ 5 ] p - value < 0 . 0001 .
Efficacy results were consistent across high and low risk strata for CMV reactivation .
The time to clinically significant CMV infection is shown in Figure 1 .
Figure 1 : P001 : Kaplan - Meier Plot of Time to Onset of Clinically Significant CMV Infection Through Week 24 Post - Transplant in HSCT Recipients ( FAS Population ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] Post - hoc analysis demonstrated that among PREVYMIS - treated subjects , inclusion in the high risk stratum for CMV reactivation at baseline , occurrence of GVHD , and steroid use at any time after randomization may be associated with the development of clinically significant CMV infection between Week 14 and Week 24 post - transplant .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Mortality The Kaplan - Meier event rate for all - cause mortality in the letermovir vs . placebo groups was 12 % vs . 17 % at Week 24 post - transplant , and 24 % vs . 28 % at Week 48 post - transplant .
