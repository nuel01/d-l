4 CONTRAINDICATIONS DIFICID is contraindicated in patients who have known hypersensitivity to fidaxomicin or any other ingredient in DIFICID [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
DIFICID is contraindicated in patients who have known hypersensitivity to fidaxomicin or any other ingredient in DIFICID .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Acute hypersensitivity reactions ( angioedema , dyspnea , pruritus , and rash ) have been reported .
If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs , discontinue DIFICID .
( 5 . 1 ) • DIFICID is not expected to be effective for the treatment of other types of infections due to minimal systemic absorption of fidaxomicin .
DIFICID should only be used for the treatment of C . difficile - associated diarrhea .
( 5 . 2 ) • Development of drug - resistant bacteria : Only use DIFICID for infection proven or strongly suspected to be caused by C . difficile .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Acute hypersensitivity reactions , including dyspnea , rash , pruritus , and angioedema of the mouth , throat , and face have been reported with DIFICID .
If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs , DIFICID should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted .
Some patients with hypersensitivity reactions to DIFICID also reported a history of allergy to other macrolides .
Physicians prescribing DIFICID to patients with a known macrolide allergy should be aware of the possibility of hypersensitivity reactions .
5 . 2 Not for Use in Infections Other than C . difficile - Associated Diarrhea DIFICID is not expected to be effective for the treatment of other types of infections due to minimal systemic absorption of fidaxomicin [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
DIFICID has not been studied for the treatment of infections other than CDAD .
DIFICID should only be used for the treatment of CDAD .
5 . 3 Development of Drug - Resistant Bacteria Prescribing DIFICID in the absence of proven or strongly suspected C . difficile infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in adults ( incidence ≥ 2 % ) are nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , anemia , and neutropenia .
( 6 ) The most common adverse reactions in pediatric patients ( incidence ≥ 5 % ) treated with DIFICID are pyrexia , abdominal pain , vomiting , diarrhea , constipation , increased aminotransferases , and rash .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Adults The safety of DIFICID 200 mg tablets taken twice a day for 10 days was evaluated in 564 adult patients with CDAD in two active - controlled trials with 86 . 7 % of patients receiving a full course of treatment .
Thirty - three adult patients receiving DIFICID ( 5 . 9 % ) withdrew from trials as a result of adverse reactions ( AR ) .
The types of AR resulting in withdrawal from the study varied considerably .
Vomiting was the primary adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of dosing ; this occurred at an incidence of 0 . 5 % in both the DIFICID and vancomycin patients in Phase 3 trials .
The most common selected adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 2 % of adult patients treated with DIFICID are listed in Table 2 .

In both studies , patients received DIFICID orally twice daily for 10 days .
Patients < 2 years of age , or weighing < 12 . 5 kg , or unable to swallow tablets received weight - based doses of DIFICID oral suspension .
Patients weighing at least 12 . 5 kg and able to swallow tablets received the 200 mg DIFICID tablet .
The age range in the Phase 2 trial was 11 months to 17 years and in the Phase 3 trial was 1 month to 17 years ( one patient was less than 6 months of age ) .
One death occurred in the Phase 2 single - arm trial .
In the Phase 3 trial , there were 3 deaths in DIFICID - treated patients and no deaths in vancomycin - treated patients during the study period ( 40 days ) .
All deaths occurred in patients less than 2 years of age and appeared to be related to underlying comorbidities [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Treatment discontinuation due to adverse reactions occurred in 7 . 9 % ( 3 / 38 ) of patients in the Phase 2 trial , and in 1 % ( 1 / 98 ) and 2 . 3 % ( 1 / 44 ) of DIFICID - and vancomycin - treated patients , respectively , in the Phase 3 trial .
The most common selected adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 5 % of pediatric patients treated with DIFICID in the Phase 3 trial are listed in Table 3 .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Hypersensitivity reactions ( dyspnea , angioedema , rash , pruritus ) 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Fidaxomicin and its main metabolite , OP - 1118 , are substrates of the efflux transporter , P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) , which is expressed in the gastrointestinal tract .
7 . 1 Cyclosporine Cyclosporine is an inhibitor of multiple transporters , including P - gp .
When cyclosporine was co - administered with DIFICID , plasma concentrations of fidaxomicin and OP - 1118 were significantly increased but remained in the ng / mL range [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Concentrations of fidaxomicin and OP - 1118 may also be decreased at the site of action ( i . e . , gastrointestinal tract ) via P - gp inhibition ; however , concomitant P - gp inhibitor use had no attributable effect on safety or treatment outcome of fidaxomicin - treated adult patients in controlled clinical trials .
Based on these results , fidaxomicin may be co - administered with P - gp inhibitors and no dose adjustment is recommended .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatrics : The safety and effectiveness of DIFICID have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 6 months of age .
( 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data on use of DIFICID in pregnant women are insufficient to inform any drug - associated risk for major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Embryo - fetal reproduction studies in rats and rabbits dosed intravenously during organogenesis revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus at fidaxomicin and OP - 1118 ( its main metabolite ) exposures 65 - fold or higher than the clinical exposure at the DIFICID recommended dose [ see Data ] .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In pregnant rats , fidaxomicin was administered intravenously at doses of 4 , 8 , and 15 mg / kg / day from gestation day 6 through 17 ( during the period of organogenesis ) .
No embryo / fetal effects were noted in this study at exposures ( AUC ) 193 - fold higher for fidaxomicin , and 65 - fold higher for OP - 1118 than the clinical exposure at the DIFICID recommended dose .
In pregnant rabbits , fidaxomicin was administered intravenously at doses of 2 , 4 , and 7 . 5 mg / kg / day from gestation day 6 through 18 ( during the period of organogenesis ) .
No embryo / fetal effects were noted in this study at exposures 66 - fold higher for fidaxomicin , and 245 - fold higher for OP - 1118 than the clinical exposure at the DIFICID recommended dose .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of fidaxomicin or its main metabolite , OP - 1118 , in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for DIFICID and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from DIFICID or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of DIFICID for the treatment of CDAD have been established in pediatric patients 6 months to less than 18 years of age .
Use of DIFICID in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled trials of DIFICID in adults with CDAD and pharmacokinetic , safety and efficacy data from pediatric trials [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
No new safety signals associated with the use of DIFICID in pediatric patients were identified in the pediatric trials [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of DIFICID have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 6 months of age .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in controlled trials of DIFICID , 50 % were 65 years of age and over , while 31 % were 75 and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of DIFICID compared to vancomycin were observed between these subjects and younger subjects .
In controlled trials , elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years of age ) had higher plasma concentrations of fidaxomicin and its main metabolite , OP - 1118 , versus non - elderly patients ( < 65 years of age ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
However , greater exposures in elderly patients were not considered to be clinically significant .
No dose adjustment is recommended for elderly patients .
10 OVERDOSAGE No cases of acute overdose have been reported in humans .
No drug - related adverse effects were seen in dogs dosed with fidaxomicin tablets at 9600 mg / day ( over 100 times the human dose , scaled by weight ) for 3 months .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Fidaxomicin is an antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Fidaxomicin acts locally in the gastrointestinal tract on C . difficile .
In a dose - ranging trial ( N = 48 ) of fidaxomicin using 50 mg , 100 mg , and 200 mg twice daily for 10 days , a dose - response relationship was observed for efficacy .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic parameters of fidaxomicin and its main metabolite OP - 1118 following a single dose of 200 mg in healthy adult males ( N = 14 ) are summarized in Table 4 .
Table 4 : Mean ( ± Standard Deviation ) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Fidaxomicin 200 mg in Healthy Adult MalesParameter Fidaxomicin OP - 1118 N Value N Value Cmax ( ng / mL ) 14 5 . 20 ± 2 . 81 14 12 . 0 ± 6 . 06 Tmax ( h ) [ 1 ] 14 2 . 00 ( 1 . 00 - 5 . 00 ) 14 1 . 02 ( 1 . 00 - 5 . 00 ) AUC0 - t ( ng - h / mL ) 14 48 . 3 ± 18 . 4 14 103 ± 39 . 4 AUC0 - ∞ ( ng - h / mL ) 9 62 . 9 ± 19 . 5 10 118 ± 43 . 3 t1 / 2 ( h ) 9 11 . 7 ± 4 . 80 10 11 . 2 ± 3 . 01 [ 1 ] Tmax , reported as median ( range ) .

In fidaxomicin - treated patients from controlled trials , plasma concentrations of fidaxomicin and OP - 1118 obtained within the Tmax window ( 1 - 5 hours ) were approximately 2 - to 6 - fold higher than Cmax values in healthy adults .
Following administration of DIFICID 200 mg twice daily for 10 days , OP - 1118 plasma concentrations within the Tmax window were approximately 50 % - 80 % higher than on Day 1 , while concentrations of fidaxomicin were similar on Days 1 and 10 .
In a food - effect study involving administration of DIFICID to healthy adults ( N = 28 ) with a high - fat meal versus under fasting conditions , Cmax of fidaxomicin and OP - 1118 decreased by 21 . 5 % and 33 . 4 % , respectively , while AUC0 - t remained unchanged .
This decrease in Cmax is not considered clinically significant , and thus , DIFICID may be administered with or without food .
Distribution Fidaxomicin is mainly confined to the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration .
In selected patients ( N = 8 ) treated with DIFICID 200 mg twice daily for 10 days from controlled trials , fecal concentrations of fidaxomicin and OP - 1118 obtained within 24 hours of the last dose ranged from 639 - 2710 µg / g and 213 - 1210 µg / g , respectively .
In contrast , plasma concentrations of fidaxomicin and OP - 1118 within the Tmax window ( 1 - 5 hours ) ranged 2 - 179 ng / mL and 10 - 829 ng / mL , respectively .
Elimination Metabolism Fidaxomicin is primarily transformed by hydrolysis at the isobutyryl ester to form its main and microbiologically active metabolite , OP - 1118 .
Metabolism of fidaxomicin and formation of OP - 1118 are not dependent on cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes .
At the therapeutic dose , OP - 1118 was the predominant circulating compound in healthy adults , followed by fidaxomicin .
Excretion Fidaxomicin is mainly excreted in feces .
In one trial of healthy adults ( N = 11 ) , more than 92 % of the dose was recovered in the stool as fidaxomicin and OP - 1118 following single doses of 200 mg and 300 mg .
In another trial of healthy adults ( N = 6 ) , 0 . 59 % of the dose was recovered in urine as OP - 1118 only following a single dose of 200 mg .
Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In controlled trials of patients treated with DIFICID 200 mg twice daily for 10 days , mean and median values of fidaxomicin and OP - 1118 plasma concentrations within the Tmax window ( 1 - 5 hours ) were approximately 2 - to 4 - fold higher in elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years of age ) versus non - elderly patients ( < 65 years of age ) .
Despite greater exposures in elderly patients , fidaxomicin and OP - 1118 plasma concentrations remained in the ng / mL range [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Pediatric Patients Similar to adults , fidaxomicin has minimal systemic absorption following oral administration across all age groups in pediatric patients .
Plasma concentrations remained in the ng / mL range at the therapeutic dose in pediatric patients with mean ( ± standard deviation ) plasma concentrations of 39 . 41 ( ± 62 . 15 ) ng / mL of fidaxomicin and 116 . 64 ( ± 259 . 10 ) ng / mL of OP - 1118 at 1 to 5 hours post - dose .
Male and Female Patients Plasma concentrations of fidaxomicin and OP - 1118 within the Tmax window ( 1 - 5 hours ) did not vary by gender in patients treated with DIFICID 200 mg twice daily for 10 days from controlled trials .
No dose adjustment is recommended based on gender .
Patients with Renal Impairment In controlled trials of patients treated with DIFICID 200 mg twice daily for 10 days , plasma concentrations of fidaxomicin and OP - 1118 within the Tmax window ( 1 - 5 hours ) did not vary by severity of renal impairment ( based on creatinine clearance ) between mild ( 51 - 79 mL / min ) , moderate ( 31 - 50 mL / min ) , and severe ( ≤ 30 mL / min ) categories .
No dose adjustment is recommended based on renal function .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment The impact of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of fidaxomicin has not been evaluated .
Because fidaxomicin and OP - 1118 do not appear to undergo significant hepatic metabolism , elimination of fidaxomicin and OP - 1118 is not expected to be significantly affected by hepatic impairment .
Drug Interaction Studies In vivo studies were conducted to evaluate intestinal drug - drug interactions of fidaxomicin as a P - gp substrate , P - gp inhibitor , and inhibitor of major CYP enzymes expressed in the gastrointestinal tract ( CYP3A4 , CYP2C9 , and CYP2C19 ) .
Table 5 summarizes the impact of a co - administered drug ( P - gp inhibitor ) on the pharmacokinetics of fidaxomicin [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .

[ 2 ] CI - confidence interval Fidaxomicin had no significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of the following co - administered drugs : digoxin ( P - gp substrate ) , midazolam ( CYP3A4 substrate ) , warfarin ( CYP2C9 substrate ) , and omeprazole ( CYP2C19 substrate ) .
No dose adjustment is warranted when fidaxomicin is co - administered with substrates of P - gp or CYP enzymes .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Fidaxomicin is a fermentation product obtained from the Actinomycete Dactylosporangium aurantiacum .
Fidaxomicin is a macrolide antibacterial drug that inhibits RNA synthesis by binding to RNA polymerases .
Fidaxomicin is bactericidal against C . difficile in vitro , and demonstrates a post - antibiotic effect vs . C . difficile of 6 - 10 hrs .
Resistance Fidaxomicin demonstrates no in vitro cross - resistance with other classes of antibacterial drugs .
In vitro studies indicate a low frequency of spontaneous resistance to fidaxomicin in C . difficile ( ranging from < 1 . 4 × 10 - 9 to 12 . 8 × 10 - 9 ) .
A specific mutation ( Val - ll43 - Gly ) in the beta subunit of RNA polymerase is associated with reduced susceptibility to fidaxomicin .
This mutation was created in the laboratory and seen during clinical trials in a C . difficile isolate obtained from an adult subject treated with DIFICID who had recurrence of CDAD .
The fidaxomicin minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) of the C . difficile isolate from this subject increased from a baseline of 0 . 06 µg / mL to 16 µg / mL at the time of CDAD recurrence .
Interaction With Other Antimicrobials Fidaxomicin and its main metabolite OP - 1118 do not exhibit any antagonistic interaction with other classes of antibacterial drugs .
Synergistic interactions of fidaxomicin and OP - 1118 have been observed in vitro with rifampin and rifaximin against C . difficile .
Antimicrobial Activity Fidaxomicin has been shown to be active against most isolates of Clostridioides ( formerly Clostridium ) difficile , both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria , and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug , please see : https : / / www . fda . gov / STIC .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of fidaxomicin .
Neither fidaxomicin nor OP - 1118 was mutagenic in the Ames assay .
Fidaxomicin was also negative in the rat micronucleus assay .
However , fidaxomicin was clastogenic in Chinese hamster ovary cells .
Fidaxomicin did not affect the fertility of male and female rats at intravenous doses of 6 . 3 mg / kg .
The exposure ( AUC0 - t ) was approximately 100 times that in humans .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Clinical Studies of DIFICID in Adult Patients with CDAD In two randomized , double - blinded trials , a non - inferiority design was utilized to demonstrate the efficacy of DIFICID ( 200 mg tablets twice daily for 10 days ) compared to vancomycin ( 125 mg four times daily for 10 days ) in adults with CDAD .
Enrolled patients were 18 years of age or older and received no more than 24 hours of pretreatment with vancomycin or metronidazole .
CDAD was defined by > 3 unformed bowel movements ( or > 200 mL of unformed stool for subjects having rectal collection devices ) in the 24 hours before randomization , and presence of either C . difficile toxin A or B in the stool within 48 hours of randomization .
Enrolled patients had either no prior CDAD history or only one prior CDAD episode in the past three months .
Subjects with life - threatening / fulminant infection , hypotension , septic shock , peritoneal signs , significant dehydration , or toxic megacolon were excluded .
The demographic profile and baseline CDAD characteristics of enrolled subjects were similar in the two trials .
Patients had a median age of 64 years , were mainly white ( 90 % ) , female ( 58 % ) , and inpatients ( 63 % ) .
The median number of bowel movements per day was 6 , and 37 % of subjects had severe CDAD ( defined as 10 or more unformed bowel movements per day or WBC ≥ 15000 / mm3 ) .
Diarrhea alone was reported in 45 % of patients and 84 % of subjects had no prior CDAD episode .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the clinical response rate at the end of treatment , based upon improvement in diarrhea or other symptoms such that , in the investigator ' s judgment , further CDAD treatment was not needed .
An additional efficacy endpoint was sustained clinical response 25 days after the end of treatment .
Sustained response was evaluated only for patients who were clinical successes at the end of treatment .
Sustained response was defined as clinical response at the end of treatment , and survival without proven or suspected CDAD recurrence through 25 days beyond the end of treatment .
The results for clinical response at the end of treatment in both trials , shown in Table 6 , indicate that DIFICID is non - inferior to vancomycin based on the 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) lower limit being greater than the non - inferiority margin of - 10 % .
The results for sustained clinical response at the end of the follow - up period , also shown in Table 6 , indicate that DIFICID is superior to vancomycin on this endpoint .
Since clinical success at the end of treatment and mortality rates were similar across treatment arms ( approximately 6 % in each group ) , differences in sustained clinical response were due to lower rates of proven or suspected CDAD during the follow - up period in DIFICID patients .

Approximately 5 % - 9 % of the data in each trial and treatment arm were missing sustained response information and were imputed using multiple imputation method .
Restriction Endonuclease Analysis ( REA ) was used to identify C . difficile baseline isolates in the BI group , isolates associated with increasing rates and severity of CDAD in the US in the years prior to the clinical trials .
Similar rates of clinical response at the end of treatment and proven or suspected CDAD during the follow - up period were seen in fidaxomicin - treated and vancomycin - treated patients infected with a BI isolate .
However , DIFICID did not demonstrate superiority in sustained clinical response when compared with vancomycin ( Table 7 ) .

Approximately 25 % of the mITT population were missing data for REA group .
Confidence intervals ( CI ) were derived using Wilson ' s score method .
14 . 2 Clinical Studies of DIFICID in Pediatric Patients with CDAD The safety and efficacy of DIFICID in pediatric patients 6 months to less than 18 years of age was investigated in a Phase 3 , multicenter , investigator - blinded , randomized , comparative trial ( NCT02218372 ) .
In this trial , 148 patients were randomized , of whom 142 received either DIFICID or vancomycin in a 2 : 1 ratio .
Randomized patients were stratified by age group as follows : 30 aged 6 months to < 2 years , 49 aged 2 to < 6 years , 40 aged 6 to < 12 years , and 29 aged 12 to < 18 years ( one patient < 6 months of age was enrolled in the trial ) .
Treatment arms were balanced regarding demographics and other baseline characteristics .
Clinical response for patients < 2 years of age was defined as the absence of watery stools for at least 2 consecutive days while on treatment and the patient remained well with no requirement for further CDAD therapy through 2 days after completing treatment as assessed by the Investigator .
Clinical response for patients ≥ 2 to < 18 years of age was defined as < 3 unformed bowel movements for at least 2 consecutive days while on treatment and the patient remained well with no requirement for further CDAD therapy through 2 days after completing treatment as assessed by the Investigator .
Sustained clinical response was defined as the proportion of treated patients with confirmed clinical response and no CDAD recurrence through 30 days after end of treatment .
The clinical response and sustained clinical response overall and by age groups are presented in Table 8 .
