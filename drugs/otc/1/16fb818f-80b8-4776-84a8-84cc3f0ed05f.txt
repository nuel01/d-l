8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from randomized studies , case series , and reports of ephedrine sulfate use in pregnant women have not identified a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
However , there are clinical considerations due to underlying conditions [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
In animal reproduction studies , decreased fetal survival and fetal body weights were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity after normotensive pregnant rats were administered 60 mg / kg intravenous ephedrine sulfate ( 12 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 50 mg / day ) .
No malformations or embryofetal adverse effects were observed when pregnant rats or rabbits were treated with intravenous bolus doses of ephedrine sulfate during organogenesis at doses 1 . 9 and 7 . 7 times the MRHD , respectively [ see Data ] .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryofetal risk Untreated hypotension associated with spinal anesthesia for cesarean section is associated with an increase in maternal nausea and vomiting .
A decrease in uterine blood flow due to maternal hypotension may result in fetal bradycardia and acidosis .
Fetal / Neonatal Adverse Reactions Cases of potential metabolic acidosis in newborns at delivery with maternal ephedrine exposure have been reported in the literature .
These reports describe umbilical artery pH of ≤ 7 . 2 at the time of delivery [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Monitoring of the newborn for signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis may be required .
Monitoring of infant ’ s acidbase status is warranted to ensure that an episode of acidosis is acute and reversible .
Data Animal Data Decreased fetal body weights were observed when pregnant rats were administered intravenous bolus doses of 60 mg / kg ephedrine sulfate ( 12 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 50 mg based on body surface area ) from Gestation Day 6 - 17 .
This dose was associated with evidence of maternal toxicity ( decreased body weight of dams and abnormal head movements ) .
No malformations or fetal deaths were noted at this dose .
No effects on fetal body weight were noted at 10 mg / kg ( 1 . 9 times the MRHD of 50 mg ) .
No evidence of malformations or embryo - fetal toxicity were noted in pregnant rabbits administered intravenous bolus doses up to 20 mg / kg ephedrine sulfate ( 7 . 7 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 50 mg based on body surface area ) from Gestation Day 6 - 20 .
This dose was associated with expected pharmacological maternal effects ( increased respiration rate , dilated pupils , piloerection ) .
Decreased fetal survival and body weights in the presence of maternal toxicity ( increased mortality ) were noted when pregnant dams were administered intravenous bolus doses of 60 mg / kg epinephrine sulfate ( approximately 12 times the MRHD based on body surface area ) from GD 6 through Lactation Day 20 .
No adverse effects were noted at 10 mg / kg ( 1 . 9 times the MRHD ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary A single published case report indicates that ephedrine is present in human milk .
However , no information is available on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for Ephedrine Sulfate Injection , USP and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Ephedrine Sulfate Injection , USP or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Ephedrine Sulfate Injection , USP in pediatric patients have not been established .
Animal Toxicity Data In a study in which juvenile rats were administered intravenous bolus doses of 2 , 10 , or 60 mg / kg ephedrine sulfate daily from Postnatal Day 35 to 56 , an increased incidence of mortality was noted at the high dose of 60 mg / kg .
The no - adverse - effect level was 10 mg / kg ( approximately 1 . 9 times a maximum daily dose of 50 mg in a 60 kg person based on body surface area ) .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ephedrine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Ephedrine and its metabolite are excreted in urine .
In patients with renal impairment , excretion of ephedrine is likely to be affected with a corresponding increase in elimination half - life , which will lead to slow elimination of ephedrine and consequently prolonged pharmacological effect and potentially adverse reactions .
Monitor patients with renal impairment carefully after the initial bolus dose for adverse events .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdose of ephedrine can cause a rapid rise in blood pressure .
In the case of an overdose , careful monitoring of blood pressure is recommended .
If blood pressure continues to rise to an unacceptable level , parenteral antihypertensive agents can be administered at the discretion of the clinician .
11 DESCRIPTION Ephedrine is an alpha - and beta - adrenergic agonist and a norepinephrine - releasing agent .
Ephedrine Sulfate Injection , USP is a clear , colorless , sterile solution for intravenous injection .
It must be diluted before intravenous administration .
The chemical name of ephedrine sulfate is ( 1 R , 2 S ) - ( - ) - 2 - Methylamino - 1 - phenyl - 1 - propanol sulfate , and the molecular weight is 428 . 5 g / mol .
Its structural formula is depicted below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Ephedrine sulfate is freely soluble in water and ethanol , very slightly soluble in chloroform , and practically insoluble in ether .
Each mL contains ephedrine sulfate 50 mg ( equivalent to 38 mg ephedrine base ) in water for injection .
The pH is adjusted with sodium hydroxide and / or glacial acetic acid if necessary .
The pH range is 4 . 5 to 7 . 0 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Ephedrine sulfate is a sympathomimetic amine that directly acts as an agonist at α - and β - adrenergic receptors and indirectly causes the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons .
Pressor effects by direct alpha - and beta - adrenergic receptor activation are mediated by increases in arterial pressures , cardiac output , and peripheral resistance .
Indirect adrenergic stimulation is caused by norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Ephedrine stimulates heart rate and cardiac output and variably increases peripheral resistance ; as a result , ephedrine usually increases blood pressure .
Stimulation of the α - adrenergic receptors of smooth muscle cells in the bladder base may increase the resistance to the outflow of urine .
Activation of β - adrenergic receptors in the lungs promotes bronchodilation .
The overall cardiovascular effect from ephedrine is the result of a balance among α - 1 adrenoceptor - mediated vasoconstriction , β - 2 adrenoceptor - mediated vasoconstriction , and β - 2 adrenoceptor - mediated vasodilatation .
Stimulation of the β - 1 adrenoceptors results in positive inotrope and chronotrope action .
Tachyphylaxis to the pressor effects of ephedrine may occur with repeated administration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Publications studying pharmacokinetics of oral administration of ( - ) - ephedrine support that ( - ) - ephedrine is metabolized into norephedrine .
However , the metabolism pathway is unknown .
Both the parent drug and the metabolite are excreted in urine .
Limited data after IV administration of ephedrine support similar observations of urinary excretion of drug and metabolite .
The plasma elimination half - life of ephedrine following oral administration was about 6 hours .
Ephedrine crosses the placental barrier [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis : Two - year feeding studies in rats and mice conducted under the National Toxicology Program ( NTP ) demonstrated no evidence of carcinogenic potential with ephedrine sulfate at doses up to 10 mg / kg / day and 27 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 times and 3 times the maximum human recommended dose on a mg / m2 basis , respectively ) .
Mutagenesis : Ephedrine sulfate tested negative in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay , the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay , the in vitro sister chromatid exchange , the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay , and the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay .
Impairment of Fertility : There was no impact on fertility or early embryonic development in a study in which male rats were administered intravenous bolus doses of 0 , 2 , 10 , or 60 mg / kg ephedrine sulfate ( up to 12 times the maximum recommended human dose of 50 mg based on body surface area ) for 28 days prior to mating and through gestation and females were treated for 14 days prior to mating through Gestation Day 7 .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The evidence for the efficacy of ephedrine injection is derived from the published literature .
Increases in blood pressure following administration of ephedrine were observed in 14 studies , including 9 where ephedrine was used in pregnant women undergoing neuraxial anesthesia during Cesarean delivery , 1 study in non - obstetric surgery under neuraxial anesthesia , and 4 studies in patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia .
Ephedrine has been shown to raise systolic and mean blood pressure when administered as a bolus dose following the development of hypotension during anesthesia .
