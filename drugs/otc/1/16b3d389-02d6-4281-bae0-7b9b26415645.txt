3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS 0 . 5 - mg , opaque , dull yellow , gelatin capsules imprinted with “ D05 ” in black ink on one side .
0 . 5 - mg soft gelatin capsules ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS DUTASTERIDE is contraindicated for use in : • Pregnancy .
In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies , dutasteride inhibited development of male fetus external genitalia .
Therefore , DUTASTERIDE may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
If DUTASTERIDE is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking DUTASTERIDE , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
• Women of childbearing potential [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
• Pediatric patients [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
• Patients with previously demonstrated , clinically significant hypersensitivity ( e . g . , serious skin reactions , angioedema ) to DUTASTERIDE or other 5 alpha - reductase inhibitors [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
• Pregnancy and women of childbearing potential .
( 4 , 5 . 4 , 8 . 1 ) • Pediatric patients .
( 4 ) • Patients with previously demonstrated , clinically significant hypersensitivity ( e . g . , serious skin reactions , angioedema ) to DUTASTERIDE or other 5 alpha - reductase inhibitors .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • DUTASTERIDE reduces serum prostate - specific antigen ( PSA ) concentration by approximately 50 % .
However , any confirmed increase in PSA while on DUTASTERIDE may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated , even if those values are still within the normal range for untreated men .
( 5 . 1 ) • DUTASTERIDE may increase the risk of high - grade prostate cancer .
( 5 . 2 , 6 . 1 ) • Prior to initiating treatment with DUTASTERIDE , consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms .
( 5 . 3 ) • Women who are pregnant or could become pregnant should not handle DUTASTERIDE Capsules due to potential risk to a male fetus .
( 5 . 4 , 8 . 1 ) • Patients should not donate blood until 6 months after their last dose of DUTASTERIDE .
( 5 . 5 ) 5 . 1 Effects on Prostate - specific Antigen ( PSA ) and the Use of PSA in Prostate Cancer Detection In clinical trials , DUTASTERIDE reduced serum PSA concentration by approximately 50 % within 3 to 6 months of treatment .
This decrease was predictable over the entire range of PSA values in subjects with symptomatic BPH , although it may vary in individuals .
DUTASTERIDE may also cause decreases in serum PSA in the presence of prostate cancer .
To interpret serial PSAs in men taking DUTASTERIDE , a new PSA baseline should be established at least 3 months after starting treatment and PSA monitored periodically thereafter .
Any confirmed increase from the lowest PSA value while on DUTASTERIDE may signal the presence of prostate cancer and should be evaluated , even if PSA levels are still within the normal range for men not taking a 5 alpha - reductase inhibitor .
Noncompliance with DUTASTERIDE may also affect PSA test results .
To interpret an isolated PSA value in a man treated with DUTASTERIDE for 3 months or more , the PSA value should be doubled for comparison with normal values in untreated men .
The free - to - total PSA ratio ( percent free PSA ) remains constant , even under the influence of DUTASTERIDE .
If clinicians elect to use percent free PSA as an aid in the detection of prostate cancer in men receiving DUTASTERIDE , no adjustment to its value appears necessary .
Coadministration of dutasteride and tamsulosin resulted in similar changes to serum PSA as dutasteride monotherapy .
5 . 2 Increased Risk of High - grade Prostate Cancer In men aged 50 to 75 years with a prior negative biopsy for prostate cancer and a baseline PSA between 2 . 5 ng / mL and 10 . 0 ng / mL taking DUTASTERIDE in the 4 - year Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events ( REDUCE ) trial , there was an increased incidence of Gleason score 8 - 10 prostate cancer compared with men taking placebo ( DUTASTERIDE 1 . 0 % versus placebo 0 . 5 % ) [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 . 3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In a 7 - year placebo - controlled clinical trial with another 5 alpha - reductase inhibitor ( finasteride 5 mg , PROSCAR ® ) , similar results for Gleason score 8 - 10 prostate cancer were observed ( finasteride 1 . 8 % versus placebo 1 . 1 % ) .
5 alpha - reductase inhibitors may increase the risk of development of high - grade prostate cancer .
Whether the effect of 5 alpha - reductase inhibitors to reduce prostate volume or trial - related factors impacted the results of these trials has not been established .
5 . 3 Evaluation for Other Urological Diseases Prior to initiating treatment with DUTASTERIDE , consideration should be given to other urological conditions that may cause similar symptoms .
In addition , BPH and prostate cancer may coexist .
5 . 4 Exposure of Women — Risk to Male Fetus DUTASTERIDE Capsules should not be handled by a woman who is pregnant or who could become pregnant .
Dutasteride is absorbed through the skin and could result in unintended fetal exposure .
If a woman who is pregnant or who could become pregnant comes in contact with leaking dutasteride capsules , the contact area should be washed immediately with soap and water [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 5 Blood Donation Men being treated with DUTASTERIDE should not donate blood until at least 6 months have passed following their last dose .
The purpose of this deferred period is to prevent administration of dutasteride to a pregnant female transfusion recipient .
5 . 6 Effect on Semen Characteristics The effects of dutasteride 0 . 5 mg / day on semen characteristics were evaluated in normal volunteers aged 18 to 52 ( n = 27 dutasteride , n = 23 placebo ) throughout 52 weeks of treatment and 24 weeks of post - treatment follow - up .
At 52 weeks , the mean percent reductions from baseline in total sperm count , semen volume , and sperm motility were 23 % , 26 % , and 18 % , respectively , in the dutasteride group when adjusted for changes from baseline in the placebo group .
Sperm concentration and sperm morphology were unaffected .
After 24 weeks of follow - up , the mean percent change in total sperm count in the dutasteride group remained 23 % lower than baseline .
While mean values for all semen parameters at all time - points remained within the normal ranges and did not meet predefined criteria for a clinically significant change ( 30 % ) , 2 subjects in the dutasteride group had decreases in sperm count of greater than 90 % from baseline at 52 weeks , with partial recovery at the 24 - week follow - up .
The clinical significance of dutasteride ’ s effect on semen characteristics for an individual patient ’ s fertility is not known .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions , reported in ≥ 1 % of subjects treated with DUTASTERIDE and more commonly than in subjects treated with placebo , are impotence , decreased libido , ejaculation disorders , and breast disorders .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
From clinical trials with DUTASTERIDE as monotherapy or in combination with tamsulosin : • The most common adverse reactions reported in subjects receiving DUTASTERIDE were impotence , decreased libido , breast disorders ( including breast enlargement and tenderness ) , and ejaculation disorders .
The most common adverse reactions reported in subjects receiving combination therapy ( DUTASTERIDE plus tamsulosin ) were impotence , decreased libido , breast disorders ( including breast enlargement and tenderness ) , ejaculation disorders , and dizziness .
Ejaculation disorders occurred significantly more in subjects receiving combination therapy ( 11 % ) compared with those receiving DUTASTERIDE ( 2 % ) or tamsulosin ( 4 % ) as monotherapy .
• Trial withdrawal due to adverse reactions occurred in 4 % of subjects receiving DUTASTERIDE , and 3 % of subjects receiving placebo in placebo - controlled trials with DUTASTERIDE .
The most common adverse reaction leading to trial withdrawal was impotence ( 1 % ) .
• In the clinical trial evaluating the combination therapy , trial withdrawal due to adverse reactions occurred in 6 % of subjects receiving combination therapy ( DUTASTERIDE plus tamsulosin ) and 4 % of subjects receiving DUTASTERIDE or tamsulosin as monotherapy .
The most common adverse reaction in all treatment arms leading to trial withdrawal was erectile dysfunction ( 1 % to 1 . 5 % ) .
Monotherapy Over 4 , 300 male subjects with BPH were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0 . 5 - mg daily doses of DUTASTERIDE in 3 identical 2 - year , placebo - controlled , double - blind , Phase 3 treatment trials , each followed by a 2 - year open - label extension .
During the double - blind treatment period , 2 , 167 male subjects were exposed to DUTASTERIDE , including 1 , 772 exposed for 1 year and 1 , 510 exposed for 2 years .
When including the open - label extensions , 1 , 009 male subjects were exposed to DUTASTERIDE for 3 years and 812 were exposed for 4 years .
The population was aged 47 to 94 years ( mean age : 66 years ) and greater than 90 % were white .
Table 1 summarizes clinical adverse reactions reported in at least 1 % of subjects receiving DUTASTERIDE and at a higher incidence than subjects receiving placebo .

These adverse reactions may persist after treatment discontinuation .
The role of dutasteride in this persistence is unknown .
[ 2 ] Includes breast tenderness and breast enlargement .
Long - term Treatment ( Up to 4 Years ) High - grade Prostate Cancer : The REDUCE trial was a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial that enrolled 8 , 231 men aged 50 to 75 years with a serum PSA of 2 . 5 ng / mL to 10 ng / mL and a negative prostate biopsy within the previous 6 months .
Subjects were randomized to receive placebo ( n = 4 , 126 ) or 0 . 5 - mg daily doses of DUTASTERIDE ( n = 4 , 105 ) for up to 4 years .
The mean age was 63 years and 91 % were white .
Subjects underwent protocol - mandated scheduled prostate biopsies at 2 and 4 years of treatment or had “ for - cause biopsies ” at non - scheduled times if clinically indicated .
There was a higher incidence of Gleason score 8 - 10 prostate cancer in men receiving DUTASTERIDE ( 1 . 0 % ) compared with men on placebo ( 0 . 5 % ) [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 . 3 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
In a 7 - year placebo - controlled clinical trial with another 5 alpha - reductase inhibitor ( finasteride 5 mg , PROSCAR ) , similar results for Gleason score 8 - 10 prostate cancer were observed ( finasteride 1 . 8 % versus placebo 1 . 1 % ) .
No clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with prostate cancer treated with DUTASTERIDE .
Reproductive and Breast Disorders In the 3 pivotal placebo - controlled BPH trials with DUTASTERIDE , each 4 years in duration , there was no evidence of increased sexual adverse reactions ( impotence , decreased libido , and ejaculation disorder ) or breast disorders with increased duration of treatment .
Among these 3 trials , there was 1 case of breast cancer in the dutasteride group and 1 case in the placebo group .
No cases of breast cancer were reported in any treatment group in the 4 - year CombAT trial or the 4 - year REDUCE trial .
The relationship between long - term use of dutasteride and male breast neoplasia is currently unknown .
Combination with Alpha - blocker Therapy ( CombAT ) Over 4 , 800 male subjects with BPH were randomly assigned to receive 0 . 5 - mg DUTASTERIDE , 0 . 4 - mg tamsulosin , or combination therapy ( 0 . 5 - mg DUTASTERIDE plus 0 . 4 - mg tamsulosin ) administered once daily in a 4 - year double - blind trial .
Overall , 1 , 623 subjects received monotherapy with DUTASTERIDE ; 1 , 611 subjects received monotherapy with tamsulosin ; and 1 , 610 subjects received combination therapy .
The population was aged 49 to 88 years ( mean age : 66 years ) and 88 % were white .
Table 2 summarizes adverse reactions reported in at least 1 % of subjects in the combination group and at a higher incidence than subjects receiving monotherapy with DUTASTERIDE or tamsulosin .

[ 2 ] Includes anorgasmia , retrograde ejaculation , semen volume decreased , orgasmic sensation decreased , orgasm abnormal , ejaculation delayed , ejaculation disorder , ejaculation failure , and premature ejaculation .
[ 3 ] These sexual adverse reactions are associated with dutasteride treatment ( including monotherapy and combination with tamsulosin ) .
These adverse reactions may persist after treatment discontinuation .
The role of dutasteride in this persistence is unknown .
[ 4 ] Includes erectile dysfunction and disturbance in sexual arousal .
[ 5 ] Includes libido decreased , libido disorder , loss of libido , sexual dysfunction , and male sexual dysfunction .
[ 6 ] Includes breast enlargement , gynecomastia , breast swelling , breast pain , breast tenderness , nipple pain , and nipple swelling .
Cardiac Failure : In CombAT , after 4 years of treatment , the incidence of the composite term cardiac failure in the combination therapy group ( 12 / 1 , 610 ; 0 . 7 % ) was higher than in either monotherapy group : DUTASTERIDE , 2 / 1 , 623 ( 0 . 1 % ) and tamsulosin , 9 / 1 , 611 ( 0 . 6 % ) .
Composite cardiac failure was also examined in a separate 4 - year placebo - controlled trial evaluating DUTASTERIDE in men at risk for development of prostate cancer .
The incidence of cardiac failure in subjects taking DUTASTERIDE was 0 . 6 % ( 26 / 4 , 105 ) compared with 0 . 4 % ( 15 / 4 , 126 ) in subjects on placebo .
A majority of subjects with cardiac failure in both trials had comorbidities associated with an increased risk of cardiac failure .
Therefore , the clinical significance of the numerical imbalances in cardiac failure is unknown .
No causal relationship between DUTASTERIDE alone or in combination with tamsulosin and cardiac failure has been established .
No imbalance was observed in the incidence of overall cardiovascular adverse events in either trial .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of DUTASTERIDE .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness , frequency of reporting , or potential causal connection to DUTASTERIDE .
Immune System Disorders : Hypersensitivity reactions , including rash , pruritus , urticaria , localized edema , serious skin reactions , and angioedema .
Neoplasms : Male breast cancer .
Psychiatric Disorders : Depressed mood .
Reproductive System and Breast Disorders : Testicular pain and testicular swelling .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Use with caution in patients taking potent , chronic CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors ( e . g . , ritonavir ) .
( 7 ) 7 . 1 Cytochrome P450 3 A Inhibitors Dutasteride is extensively metabolized in humans by the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 isoenzymes .
The effect of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors on dutasteride has not been studied .
Because of the potential for drug - drug interactions , use caution when prescribing DUTASTERIDE to patients taking potent , chronic CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors ( e . g . , ritonavir ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Alpha - adrenergic Antagonists The administration of DUTASTERIDE in combination with tamsulosin or terazosin has no effect on the steady - state pharmacokinetics of either alpha - adrenergic antagonist .
The effect of administration of tamsulosin or terazosin on dutasteride pharmacokinetic parameters has not been evaluated .
7 . 3 Calcium Channel Antagonists Coadministration of verapamil or diltiazem decreases dutasteride clearance and leads to increased exposure to dutasteride .
The change in dutasteride exposure is not considered to be clinically significant .
No dose adjustment is recommended [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 4 Cholestyramine Administration of a single 5 - mg dose of DUTASTERIDE followed 1 hour later by 12 g of cholestyramine does not affect the relative bioavailability of dutasteride [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 5 Digoxin DUTASTERIDE does not alter the steady - state pharmacokinetics of digoxin when administered concomitantly at a dose of 0 . 5 mg / day for 3 weeks [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 6 Warfarin Concomitant administration of DUTASTERIDE 0 . 5 mg / day for 3 weeks with warfarin does not alter the steady - state pharmacokinetics of the S - or R - warfarin isomers or alter the effect of warfarin on prothrombin time [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X . DUTASTERIDE is contraindicated for use in women of childbearing potential and during pregnancy .
DUTASTERIDE is a 5 alpha - reductase inhibitor that prevents conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) , a hormone necessary for normal development of male genitalia .
In animal reproduction and developmental toxicity studies , dutasteride inhibited normal development of external genitalia in male fetuses .
Therefore , DUTASTERIDE may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
If DUTASTERIDE is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking DUTASTERIDE , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus .
Abnormalities in the genitalia of male fetuses is an expected physiological consequence of inhibition of the conversion of testosterone to DHT by 5 alpha - reductase inhibitors .
These results are similar to observations in male infants with genetic 5 alpha - reductase deficiency .
Dutasteride is absorbed through the skin .
To avoid potential fetal exposure , women who are pregnant or could become pregnant should not handle DUTASTERIDE soft gelatin capsules .
If contact is made with leaking capsules , the contact area should be washed immediately with soap and water [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Dutasteride is secreted into semen .
The highest measured semen concentration of dutasteride in treated men was 14 ng / mL .
Assuming exposure of a 50 - kg woman to 5 mL of semen and 100 % absorption , the woman ’ s dutasteride concentration would be about 0 . 0175 ng / mL .
This concentration is more than 100 times less than concentrations producing abnormalities of male genitalia in animal studies .
Dutasteride is highly protein bound in human semen ( greater than 96 % ) , which may reduce the amount of dutasteride available for vaginal absorption .
In an embryo - fetal development study in female rats , oral administration of dutasteride at doses 10 times less than the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 0 . 5 mg daily resulted in abnormalities of male genitalia in the fetus ( decreased anogenital distance at 0 . 05 mg / kg / day ) , nipple development , hypospadias , and distended preputial glands in male offspring ( at all doses of 0 . 05 , 2 . 5 , 12 . 5 , and 30 mg / kg / day ) .
An increase in stillborn pups was observed at 111 times the MRHD , and reduced fetal body weight was observed at doses of about 15 times the MRHD ( animal dose of 2 . 5 mg / kg / day ) .
Increased incidences of skeletal variations considered to be delays in ossification associated with reduced body weight were observed at doses about 56 times the MRHD ( animal dose of 12 . 5 mg / kg / day ) .
In a rabbit embryo - fetal study , doses 28 - to 93 - fold the MRHD ( animal doses of 30 , 100 , and 200 mg / kg / day ) were administered orally during the period of major organogenesis ( gestation days 7 to 29 ) to encompass the late period of external genitalia development .
Histological evaluation of the genital papilla of fetuses revealed evidence of feminization of the male fetus at all doses .
A second embryo - fetal study in rabbits at 0 . 3 - to 53 - fold the expected clinical exposure ( animal doses of 0 . 05 , 0 . 4 , 3 . 0 , and 30 mg / kg / day ) also produced evidence of feminization of the genitalia in male fetuses at all doses .
In an oral pre - and post - natal development study in rats , dutasteride doses of 0 . 05 , 2 . 5 , 12 . 5 , or 30 mg / kg / day were administered .
Unequivocal evidence of feminization of the genitalia ( i . e . , decreased anogenital distance , increased incidence of hypospadias , nipple development ) of male offspring occurred at 14 - to 90 - fold the MRHD ( animal doses of 2 . 5 mg / kg / day or greater ) .
At 0 . 05 - fold the expected clinical exposure ( animal dose of 0 . 05 mg / kg / day ) , evidence of feminization was limited to a small , but statistically significant , decrease in anogenital distance .
Animal doses of 2 . 5 to 30 mg / kg / day resulted in prolonged gestation in the parental females and a decrease in time to vaginal patency for female offspring and a decrease in prostate and seminal vesicle weights in male offspring .
Effects on newborn startle response were noted at doses greater than or equal to 12 . 5 mg / kg / day .
Increased stillbirths were noted at 30 mg / kg / day .
In an embryo - fetal development study , pregnant rhesus monkeys were exposed intravenously to a dutasteride blood level comparable to the dutasteride concentration found in human semen .
Dutasteride was administered on gestation days 20 to 100 at doses of 400 , 780 , 1 , 325 , or 2 , 010 ng / day ( 12 monkeys / group ) .
The development of male external genitalia of monkey offspring was not adversely affected .
Reduction of fetal adrenal weights , reduction in fetal prostate weights , and increases in fetal ovarian and testis weights were observed at the highest dose tested in monkeys .
Based on the highest measured semen concentration of dutasteride in treated men ( 14 ng / mL ) , these doses represent 0 . 8 to 16 times the potential maximum exposure of a 50 - kg human female to 5 mL semen daily from a dutasteride - treated man , assuming 100 % absorption .
( These calculations are based on blood levels of parent drug which are achieved at 32 to 186 times the daily doses administered to pregnant monkeys on a ng / kg basis ) .
Dutasteride is highly bound to proteins in human semen ( greater than 96 % ) , potentially reducing the amount of dutasteride available for vaginal absorption .
It is not known whether rabbits or rhesus monkeys produce any of the major human metabolites .
Estimates of exposure multiples comparing animal studies to the MRHD for dutasteride are based on clinical serum concentration at steady state .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers DUTASTERIDE is contraindicated for use in women of childbearing potential , including nursing women .
It is not known whether dutasteride is excreted in human milk .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use DUTASTERIDE is contraindicated for use in pediatric patients .
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of 2 , 167 male subjects treated with DUTASTERIDE in 3 clinical trials , 60 % were aged 65 years and older and 15 % were aged 75 years and older .
No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these subjects and younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary for DUTASTERIDE in patients with renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on dutasteride pharmacokinetics has not been studied .
Because dutasteride is extensively metabolized , exposure could be higher in hepatically impaired patients .
However , in a clinical trial where 60 subjects received 5 mg ( 10 times the therapeutic dose ) daily for 24 weeks , no additional adverse events were observed compared with those observed at the therapeutic dose of 0 . 5 mg [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE In volunteer trials , single doses of dutasteride up to 40 mg ( 80 times the therapeutic dose ) for 7 days have been administered without significant safety concerns .
In a clinical trial , daily doses of 5 mg ( 10 times the therapeutic dose ) were administered to 60 subjects for 6 months with no additional adverse effects to those seen at therapeutic doses of 0 . 5 mg .
There is no specific antidote for dutasteride .
Therefore , in cases of suspected overdosage , symptomatic and supportive treatment should be given as appropriate , taking the long half - life of dutasteride into consideration .

It is soluble in ethanol ( 44 mg / mL ) , methanol ( 64 mg / mL ) , and polyethylene glycol 400 ( 3 mg / mL ) , but it is insoluble in water .
Each DUTASTERIDE soft gelatin capsule , administered orally , contains 0 . 5 mg of dutasteride dissolved in a mixture of mono - di - glycerides of caprylic / capric acid and butylated hydroxytoluene .
The inactive excipients in the capsule shell are ferric oxide ( yellow ) , gelatin ( from certified BSE - free bovine sources ) , glycerin , and titanium dioxide .
The soft gelatin capsules are printed with edible black ink .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Dutasteride inhibits the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) .
DHT is the androgen primarily responsible for the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland .
Testosterone is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5 alpha - reductase , which exists as 2 isoforms , type 1 and type 2 .
The type 2 isoenzyme is primarily active in the reproductive tissues , while the type 1 isoenzyme is also responsible for testosterone conversion in the skin and liver .
Dutasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of both type 1 and type 2 5 alpha - reductase isoenzymes , with which it forms a stable enzyme complex .
Dissociation from this complex has been evaluated under in vitro and in vivo conditions and is extremely slow .
Dutasteride does not bind to the human androgen receptor .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on 5 Alpha - dihydrotestosterone and Testosterone The maximum effect of daily doses of dutasteride on the reduction of DHT is dose dependent and is observed within 1 to 2 weeks .
After 1 and 2 weeks of daily dosing with dutasteride 0 . 5 mg , median serum DHT concentrations were reduced by 85 % and 90 % , respectively .
In patients with BPH treated with dutasteride 0 . 5 mg / day for 4 years , the median decrease in serum DHT was 94 % at 1 year , 93 % at 2 years , and 95 % at both 3 and 4 years .
The median increase in serum testosterone was 19 % at both 1 and 2 years , 26 % at 3 years , and 22 % at 4 years , but the mean and median levels remained within the physiologic range .
In patients with BPH treated with 5 mg / day of dutasteride or placebo for up to 12 weeks prior to transurethral resection of the prostate , mean DHT concentrations in prostatic tissue were significantly lower in the dutasteride group compared with placebo ( 784 and 5 , 793 pg / g , respectively , P < 0 . 001 ) .
Mean prostatic tissue concentrations of testosterone were significantly higher in the dutasteride group compared with placebo ( 2 , 073 and 93 pg / g , respectively , P < 0 . 001 ) .
Adult males with genetically inherited type 2 5 alpha - reductase deficiency also have decreased DHT levels .
These 5 alpha - reductase deficient males have a small prostate gland throughout life and do not develop BPH .
Except for the associated urogenital defects present at birth , no other clinical abnormalities related to 5 alpha - reductase - deficiency have been observed in these individuals .
Effects on Other Hormones In healthy volunteers , 52 weeks of treatment with dutasteride 0 . 5 mg / day ( n = 26 ) resulted in no clinically significant change compared with placebo ( n = 23 ) in sex hormone - binding globulin , estradiol , luteinizing hormone , follicle - stimulating hormone , thyroxine ( free T4 ) , and dehydroepiandrosterone .
Statistically significant , baseline - adjusted mean increases compared with placebo were observed for total testosterone at 8 weeks ( 97 . 1 ng / dL , P < 0 . 003 ) and thyroid - stimulating hormone at 52 weeks ( 0 . 4 mcIU / mL , P < 0 . 05 ) .
The median percentage changes from baseline within the dutasteride group were 17 . 9 % for testosterone at 8 weeks and 12 . 4 % for thyroid - stimulating hormone at 52 weeks .
After stopping dutasteride for 24 weeks , the mean levels of testosterone and thyroid - stimulating hormone had returned to baseline in the group of subjects with available data at the visit .
In subjects with BPH treated with dutasteride in a large randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial , there was a median percent increase in luteinizing hormone of 12 % at 6 months and 19 % at both 12 and 24 months .
Other Effects Plasma lipid panel and bone mineral density were evaluated following 52 weeks of dutasteride 0 . 5 mg once daily in healthy volunteers .
There was no change in bone mineral density as measured by dual energy x - ray absorptiometry compared with either placebo or baseline .
In addition , the plasma lipid profile ( i . e . , total cholesterol , low density lipoproteins , high density lipoproteins , and triglycerides ) was unaffected by dutasteride .
No clinically significant changes in adrenal hormone responses to adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) stimulation were observed in a subset population ( n = 13 ) of the 1 - year healthy volunteer trial .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following administration of a single 0 . 5 - mg dose of a soft gelatin capsule , time to peak serum concentrations ( Tmax ) of dutasteride occurs within 2 to 3 hours .
Absolute bioavailability in 5 healthy subjects is approximately 60 % ( range : 40 % to 94 % ) .
When the drug is administered with food , the maximum serum concentrations were reduced by 10 % to 15 % .
This reduction is of no clinical significance .
Distribution Pharmacokinetic data following single and repeat oral doses show that dutasteride has a large volume of distribution ( 300 to 500 L ) .
Dutasteride is highly bound to plasma albumin ( 99 . 0 % ) and alpha - 1 acid glycoprotein ( 96 . 6 % ) .
In a trial of healthy subjects ( n = 26 ) receiving dutasteride 0 . 5 mg / day for 12 months , semen dutasteride concentrations averaged 3 . 4 ng / mL ( range : 0 . 4 to 14 ng / mL ) at 12 months and , similar to serum , achieved steady - state concentrations at 6 months .
On average , at 12 months 11 . 5 % of serum dutasteride concentrations partitioned into semen .
Metabolism and Elimination Dutasteride is extensively metabolized in humans .
In vitro studies showed that dutasteride is metabolized by the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 isoenzymes .
Both of these isoenzymes produced the 4 ′ - hydroxydutasteride , 6 - hydroxydutasteride , and the 6 , 4 ′ - dihydroxydutasteride metabolites .
In addition , the 15 - hydroxydutasteride metabolite was formed by CYP3A4 .
Dutasteride is not metabolized in vitro by human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , and CYP2E1 .
In human serum following dosing to steady state , unchanged dutasteride , 3 major metabolites ( 4 ′ - hydroxydutasteride , 1 , 2 - dihydrodutasteride , and 6 - hydroxydutasteride ) , and 2 minor metabolites ( 6 , 4 ′ - dihydroxydutasteride and 15 - hydroxydutasteride ) , as assessed by mass spectrometric response , have been detected .
The absolute stereochemistry of the hydroxyl additions in the 6 and 15 positions is not known .
In vitro , the 4 ′ - hydroxydutasteride and 1 , 2 - dihydrodutasteride metabolites are much less potent than dutasteride against both isoforms of human 5 alpha - reductase .
The activity of 6β - hydroxydutasteride is comparable to that of dutasteride .
Dutasteride and its metabolites were excreted mainly in feces .
As a percent of dose , there was approximately 5 % unchanged dutasteride ( ~ 1 % to ~ 15 % ) and 40 % as dutasteride - related metabolites ( ~ 2 % to ~ 90 % ) .
Only trace amounts of unchanged dutasteride were found in urine ( < 1 % ) .
Therefore , on average , the dose unaccounted for approximated 55 % ( range : 5 % to 97 % ) .
The terminal elimination half - life of dutasteride is approximately 5 weeks at steady state .
The average steady - state serum dutasteride concentration was 40 ng / mL following 0 . 5 mg / day for 1 year .
Following daily dosing , dutasteride serum concentrations achieve 65 % of steady - state concentration after 1 month and approximately 90 % after 3 months .
Due to the long half - life of dutasteride , serum concentrations remain detectable ( greater than 0 . 1 ng / mL ) for up to 4 to 6 months after discontinuation of treatment .
Specific Populations Pediatric : Dutasteride pharmacokinetics have not been investigated in subjects younger than 18 years .
Geriatric : No dose adjustment is necessary in the elderly .
The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of dutasteride were evaluated in 36 healthy male subjects aged between 24 and 87 years following administration of a single 5 - mg dose of dutasteride .
In this single - dose trial , dutasteride half - life increased with age ( approximately 170 hours in men aged 20 to 49 years , approximately 260 hours in men aged 50 to 69 years , and approximately 300 hours in men older than 70 years ) .
Of 2 , 167 men treated with dutasteride in the 3 pivotal trials , 60 % were age 65 and over and 15 % were age 75 and over .
No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these patients and younger patients .
Gender : DUTASTERIDE is contraindicated in pregnancy and women of childbearing potential and is not indicated for use in other women [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The pharmacokinetics of dutasteride in women have not been studied .
Race : The effect of race on dutasteride pharmacokinetics has not been studied .
Renal Impairment : The effect of renal impairment on dutasteride pharmacokinetics has not been studied .
However , less than 0 . 1 % of a steady - state 0 . 5 - mg dose of dutasteride is recovered in human urine , so no adjustment in dosage is anticipated for patients with renal impairment .
Hepatic Impairment : The effect of hepatic impairment on dutasteride pharmacokinetics has not been studied .
Because dutasteride is extensively metabolized , exposure could be higher in hepatically impaired patients .
Drug Interactions Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors : No clinical drug interaction trials have been performed to evaluate the impact of CYP3A enzyme inhibitors on dutasteride pharmacokinetics .
However , based on in vitro data , blood concentrations of dutasteride may increase in the presence of inhibitors of CYP3A4 / 5 such as ritonavir , ketoconazole , verapamil , diltiazem , cimetidine , troleandomycin , and ciprofloxacin .
Dutasteride does not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of model substrates for the major human cytochrome P450 isoenzymes ( CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , and CYP3A4 ) at a concentration of 1 , 000 ng / mL , 25 times greater than steady - state serum concentrations in humans .
Alpha - adrenergic Antagonists : In a single - sequence , crossover trial in healthy volunteers , the administration of tamsulosin or terazosin in combination with DUTASTERIDE had no effect on the steady - state pharmacokinetics of either alpha - adrenergic antagonist .
Although the effect of administration of tamsulosin or terazosin on dutasteride pharmacokinetic parameters was not evaluated , the percent change in DHT concentrations was similar for DUTASTERIDE alone compared with the combination treatment .
Calcium Channel Antagonists : In a population pharmacokinetics analysis , a decrease in clearance of dutasteride was noted when coadministered with the CYP3A4 inhibitors verapamil ( - 37 % , n = 6 ) and diltiazem ( - 44 % , n = 5 ) .
In contrast , no decrease in clearance was seen when amlodipine , another calcium channel antagonist that is not a CYP3A4 inhibitor , was coadministered with dutasteride ( + 7 % , n = 4 ) .
The decrease in clearance and subsequent increase in exposure to dutasteride in the presence of verapamil and diltiazem is not considered to be clinically significant .
No dose adjustment is recommended .
Cholestyramine : Administration of a single 5 - mg dose of DUTASTERIDE followed 1 hour later by 12 g cholestyramine did not affect the relative bioavailability of dutasteride in 12 normal volunteers .
Digoxin : In a trial of 20 healthy volunteers , DUTASTERIDE did not alter the steady - state pharmacokinetics of digoxin when administered concomitantly at a dose of 0 . 5 mg / day for 3 weeks .
Warfarin : In a trial of 23 healthy volunteers , 3 weeks of treatment with DUTASTERIDE 0 . 5 mg / day did not alter the steady - state pharmacokinetics of the S - or R - warfarin isomers or alter the effect of warfarin on prothrombin time when administered with warfarin .
Other Concomitant Therapy : Although specific interaction trials were not performed with other compounds , approximately 90 % of the subjects in the 3 randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled safety and efficacy trials receiving DUTASTERIDE were taking other medications concomitantly .
No clinically significant adverse interactions could be attributed to the combination of DUTASTERIDE and concurrent therapy when DUTASTERIDE was coadministered with anti - hyperlipidemics , angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , beta - adrenergic blocking agents , calcium channel blockers , corticosteroids , diuretics , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , phosphodiesterase Type V inhibitors , and quinolone antibiotics .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis A 2 - year carcinogenicity study was conducted in B6C3F1 mice at doses of 3 , 35 , 250 , and 500 mg / kg / day for males and 3 , 35 , and 250 mg / kg / day for females ; an increased incidence of benign hepatocellular adenomas was noted at 250 mg / kg / day ( 290 - fold the MRHD of a 0 . 5 - mg daily dose ) in female mice only .
Two of the 3 major human metabolites have been detected in mice .
The exposure to these metabolites in mice is either lower than in humans or is not known .
In a 2 - year carcinogenicity study in Han Wistar rats , at doses of 1 . 5 , 7 . 5 , and 53 mg / kg / day in males and 0 . 8 , 6 . 3 , and 15 mg / kg / day in females , there was an increase in Leydig cell adenomas in the testes at 135 - fold the MRHD ( 53 mg / kg / day and greater ) .
An increased incidence of Leydig cell hyperplasia was present at 52 - fold the MRHD ( male rat doses of 7 . 5 mg / kg / day and greater ) .
A positive correlation between proliferative changes in the Leydig cells and an increase in circulating luteinizing hormone levels has been demonstrated with 5 alpha - reductase inhibitors and is consistent with an effect on the hypothalamic - pituitary - testicular axis following 5 alpha - reductase inhibition .
At tumorigenic doses , luteinizing hormone levels in rats were increased by 167 % .
In this study , the major human metabolites were tested for carcinogenicity at approximately 1 to 3 times the expected clinical exposure .
Mutagenesis Dutasteride was tested for genotoxicity in a bacterial mutagenesis assay ( Ames test ) , a chromosomal aberration assay in CHO cells , and a micronucleus assay in rats .
The results did not indicate any genotoxic potential of the parent drug .
Two major human metabolites were also negative in either the Ames test or an abbreviated Ames test .
Impairment of Fertility Treatment of sexually mature male rats with dutasteride at 0 . 1 - to 110 - fold the MRHD ( animal doses of 0 . 05 , 10 , 50 , and 500 mg / kg / day for up to 31 weeks ) resulted in dose - and time - dependent decreases in fertility ; reduced cauda epididymal ( absolute ) sperm counts but not sperm concentration ( at 50 and 500 mg / kg / day ) ; reduced weights of the epididymis , prostate , and seminal vesicles ; and microscopic changes in the male reproductive organs .
The fertility effects were reversed by recovery Week 6 at all doses , and sperm counts were normal at the end of a 14 - week recovery period .
The 5 alpha - reductase – related changes consisted of cytoplasmic vacuolation of tubular epithelium in the epididymides and decreased cytoplasmic content of epithelium , consistent with decreased secretory activity in the prostate and seminal vesicles .
The microscopic changes were no longer present at recovery Week 14 in the low - dose group and were partly recovered in the remaining treatment groups .
Low levels of dutasteride ( 0 . 6 to 17 ng / mL ) were detected in the serum of untreated female rats mated to males dosed at 10 , 50 , or 500 mg / kg / day for 29 to 30 weeks .
In a fertility study in female rats , oral administration of dutasteride at doses of 0 . 05 , 2 . 5 , 12 . 5 , and 30 mg / kg / day resulted in reduced litter size , increased embryo resorption , and feminization of male fetuses ( decreased anogenital distance ) at 2 - to 10 - fold the MRHD ( animal doses of 2 . 5 mg / kg / day or greater ) .
Fetal body weights were also reduced at less than 0 . 02 - fold the MRHD in rats ( 0 . 5 mg / kg / day ) .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Central Nervous System Toxicology Studies In rats and dogs , repeated oral administration of dutasteride resulted in some animals showing signs of non - specific , reversible , centrally - mediated toxicity without associated histopathological changes at exposures 425 - and 315 - fold the expected clinical exposure ( of parent drug ) , respectively .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Monotherapy DUTASTERIDE 0 . 5 mg / day ( n = 2 , 167 ) or placebo ( n = 2 , 158 ) was evaluated in male subjects with BPH in three 2 - year multicenter , placebo - controlled , double - blind trials , each with 2 - year open - label extensions ( n = 2 , 340 ) .
More than 90 % of the trial population was white .
Subjects were at least 50 years of age with a serum PSA ≥ 1 . 5 ng / mL and < 10 ng / mL and BPH diagnosed by medical history and physical examination , including enlarged prostate ( ≥ 30 cc ) and BPH symptoms that were moderate to severe according to the American Urological Association Symptom Index ( AUA - SI ) .
Most of the 4 , 325 subjects randomly assigned to receive either dutasteride or placebo completed 2 years of double - blind treatment ( 70 % and 67 % , respectively ) .
Most of the 2 , 340 subjects in the trial extensions completed 2 additional years of open - label treatment ( 71 % ) .
Effect on Symptom Scores Symptoms were quantified using the AUA - SI , a questionnaire that evaluates urinary symptoms ( incomplete emptying , frequency , intermittency , urgency , weak stream , straining , and nocturia ) by rating on a 0 to 5 scale for a total possible score of 35 , with higher numerical total symptom scores representing greater severity of symptoms .
The baseline AUA - SI score across the 3 trials was approximately 17 units in both treatment groups .
Subjects receiving dutasteride achieved statistically significant improvement in symptoms versus placebo by Month 3 in 1 trial and by Month 12 in the other 2 pivotal trials .
At Month 12 , the mean decrease from baseline in AUA - SI total symptom scores across the 3 trials pooled was - 3 . 3 units for dutasteride and - 2 . 0 units for placebo with a mean difference between the 2 treatment groups of - 1 . 3 ( range : - 1 . 1 to - 1 . 5 units in each of the 3 trials , P < 0 . 001 ) and was consistent across the 3 trials .
At Month 24 , the mean decrease from baseline was - 3 . 8 units for dutasteride and - 1 . 7 units for placebo with a mean difference of - 2 . 1 ( range : - 1 . 9 to - 2 . 2 units in each of the 3 trials , P < 0 . 001 ) .
See Figure 1 .
The improvement in BPH symptoms seen during the first 2 years of double - blind treatment was maintained throughout an additional 2 years of open - label extension trials .
These trials were prospectively designed to evaluate effects on symptoms based on prostate size at baseline .
In men with prostate volumes ≥ 40 cc , the mean decrease was - 3 . 8 units for dutasteride and - 1 . 6 units for placebo , with a mean difference between the 2 treatment groups of - 2 . 2 at Month 24 .
In men with prostate volumes < 40 cc , the mean decrease was - 3 . 7 units for dutasteride and - 2 . 2 units for placebo , with a mean difference between the 2 treatment groups of - 1 . 5 at Month 24 .

AUA - SI Scorea Change from Baseline ( Randomized , Double - blind , Placebo - controlled Trials Pooled ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] a AUA - SI score ranges from 0 to 35 .
Effect on Acute Urinary Retention and the Need for BPH - related Surgery Efficacy was also assessed after 2 years of treatment by the incidence of AUR requiring catheterization and BPH - related urological surgical intervention .
Compared with placebo , DUTASTERIDE was associated with a statistically significantly lower incidence of AUR ( 1 . 8 % for DUTASTERIDE versus 4 . 2 % for placebo , P < 0 . 001 ; 57 % reduction in risk , [ 95 % CI : 38 % to 71 % ] ) and with a statistically significantly lower incidence of surgery ( 2 . 2 % for DUTASTERIDE versus 4 . 1 % for placebo , P < 0 . 001 ; 48 % reduction in risk , [ 95 % CI : 26 % to 63 % ] ) .

Percent of Subjects Having Surgery for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia over a 24 - Month Period ( Randomized , Double - blind , Placebo - controlled Trials Pooled ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] Effect on Prostate Volume A prostate volume of at least 30 cc measured by transrectal ultrasound was required for trial entry .
The mean prostate volume at trial entry was approximately 54 cc .
Statistically significant differences ( DUTASTERIDE versus placebo ) were noted at the earliest post - treatment prostate volume measurement in each trial ( Month 1 , Month 3 , or Month 6 ) and continued through Month 24 .
At Month 12 , the mean percent change in prostate volume across the 3 trials pooled was - 24 . 7 % for dutasteride and - 3 . 4 % for placebo ; the mean difference ( dutasteride minus placebo ) was - 21 . 3 % ( range : - 21 . 0 % to - 21 . 6 % in each of the 3 trials , P < 0 . 001 ) .
At Month 24 , the mean percent change in prostate volume across the 3 trials pooled was - 26 . 7 % for dutasteride and - 2 . 2 % for placebo with a mean difference of - 24 . 5 % ( range : - 24 . 0 % to - 25 . 1 % in each of the 3 trials , P < 0 . 001 ) .
See Figure 4 .
The reduction in prostate volume seen during the first 2 years of double - blind treatment was maintained throughout an additional 2 years of open - label extension trials .
Figure 4 .
Prostate Volume Percent Change from Baseline ( Randomized , Double - blind , Placebo - controlled Trials Pooled ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] Effect on Maximum Urine Flow Rate A mean peak urine flow rate ( Qmax ) of ≤ 15 mL / sec was required for trial entry .
Qmax was approximately 10 mL / sec at baseline across the 3 pivotal trials .
Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant from baseline at Month 3 in all 3 trials and were maintained through Month 12 .
At Month 12 , the mean increase in Qmax across the 3 trials pooled was 1 . 6 mL / sec for DUTASTERIDE and 0 . 7 mL / sec for placebo ; the mean difference ( dutasteride minus placebo ) was 0 . 8 mL / sec ( range : 0 . 7 to 1 . 0 mL / sec in each of the 3 trials , P < 0 . 001 ) .
At Month 24 , the mean increase in Qmax was 1 . 8 mL / sec for dutasteride and 0 . 7 mL / sec for placebo , with a mean difference of 1 . 1 mL / sec ( range : 1 . 0 to 1 . 2 mL / sec in each of the 3 trials , P < 0 . 001 ) .
See Figure 5 .
The increase in maximum urine flow rate seen during the first 2 years of double - blind treatment was maintained throughout an additional 2 years of open - label extension trials .
Figure 5 .
Qmax Change from Baseline ( Randomized , Double - blind , Placebo - controlled Trials Pooled ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] Summary of Clinical Trials Data from 3 large , well - controlled efficacy trials demonstrate that treatment with DUTASTERIDE ( 0 . 5 mg once daily ) reduces the risk of both AUR and BPH - related surgical intervention relative to placebo , improves BPH - related symptoms , decreases prostate volume , and increases maximum urinary flow rates .
These data suggest that DUTASTERIDE arrests the disease process of BPH in men with an enlarged prostate .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Combination with Alpha - blocker Therapy ( CombAT ) The efficacy of combination therapy ( DUTASTERIDE 0 . 5 mg / day plus tamsulosin 0 . 4 mg / day , n = 1 , 610 ) was compared with DUTASTERIDE alone ( n = 1 , 623 ) or tamsulosin alone ( n = 1 , 611 ) in a 4 - year multicenter , randomized , double - blind trial .
Trial entry criteria were similar to the double - blind , placebo - controlled monotherapy efficacy trials described above in section 14 . 1 .
Eighty - eight percent ( 88 % ) of the enrolled trial population was white .
Approximately 52 % of subjects had previous exposure to 5 alpha - reductase - inhibitor or alpha - adrenergic - antagonist treatment .
Of the 4 , 844 subjects randomly assigned to receive treatment , 69 % of subjects in the combination group , 67 % in the group receiving DUTASTERIDE , and 61 % in the tamsulosin group completed 4 years of double - blind treatment .
Effect on Symptom Score Symptoms were quantified using the first 7 questions of the International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS ) ( identical to the AUA - SI ) .
The baseline score was approximately 16 . 4 units for each treatment group .
Combination therapy was statistically superior to each of the monotherapy treatments in decreasing symptom score at Month 24 , the primary time point for this endpoint .
At Month 24 the mean changes from baseline ( ± SD ) in IPSS total symptom scores were - 6 . 2 ( ± 7 . 14 ) for combination , - 4 . 9 ( ± 6 . 81 ) for DUTASTERIDE , and - 4 . 3 ( ± 7 . 01 ) for tamsulosin , with a mean difference between combination and DUTASTERIDE of - 1 . 3 units ( P < 0 . 001 ; [ 95 % CI : - 1 . 69 , - 0 . 86 ] ) , and between combination and tamsulosin of - 1 . 8 units ( P < 0 . 001 ; [ 95 % CI : - 2 . 23 , - 1 . 40 ] ) .
A significant difference was seen by Month 9 and continued through Month 48 .
At Month 48 the mean changes from baseline ( ± SD ) in IPSS total symptom scores were - 6 . 3 ( ± 7 . 40 ) for combination , - 5 . 3 ( ± 7 . 14 ) for DUTASTERIDE , and - 3 . 8 ( ± 7 . 74 ) for tamsulosin , with a mean difference between combination and DUTASTERIDE of - 0 . 96 units ( P < 0 . 001 ; [ 95 % CI : - 1 . 40 , - 0 . 52 ] ) , and between combination and tamsulosin of - 2 . 5 units ( P < 0 . 001 ; [ 95 % CI : - 2 . 96 , - 2 . 07 ] ) .

International Prostate Symptom Score Change from Baseline over a 48 - Month Period ( Randomized , Double - blind , Parallel - group Trial [ CombAT Trial ] ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] Effect on Acute Urinary Retention or the Need for BPH - Related Surgery After 4 years of treatment , combination therapy with DUTASTERIDE and tamsulosin did not provide benefit over monotherapy with DUTASTERIDE in reducing the incidence of AUR or BPH - related surgery .
Effect on Maximum Urine Flow Rate The baseline Qmax was approximately 10 . 7 mL / sec for each treatment group .
Combination therapy was statistically superior to each of the monotherapy treatments in increasing Qmax at Month 24 , the primary time point for this endpoint .
At Month 24 , the mean increases from baseline ( ± SD ) in Qmax were 2 . 4 ( ± 5 . 26 ) mL / sec for combination , 1 . 9 ( ± 5 . 10 ) mL / sec for DUTASTERIDE , and 0 . 9 ( ± 4 . 57 ) mL / sec for tamsulosin , with a mean difference between combination and DUTASTERIDE of 0 . 5 mL / sec ( P = 0 . 003 ; [ 95 % CI : 0 . 17 , 0 . 84 ] ) , and between combination and tamsulosin of 1 . 5 mL / sec ( P < 0 . 001 ; [ 95 % CI : 1 . 19 , 1 . 86 ] ) .
This difference was seen by Month 6 and continued through Month 24 .
See Figure 7 .
The additional improvement in Qmax of combination therapy over monotherapy with DUTASTERIDE was no longer statistically significant at Month 48 .

Qmax Change from Baseline over a 24 - Month Period ( Randomized , Double - blind , Parallel - group Trial [ CombAT Trial ] ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] Effect on Prostate Volume The mean prostate volume at trial entry was approximately 55 cc .
At Month 24 , the primary time point for this endpoint , the mean percent changes from baseline ( ± SD ) in prostate volume were - 26 . 9 % ( ± 22 . 57 ) for combination therapy , - 28 . 0 % ( ± 24 . 88 ) for DUTASTERIDE , and 0 % ( ± 31 . 14 ) for tamsulosin , with a mean difference between combination and DUTASTERIDE of 1 . 1 % ( P = NS ; [ 95 % CI : - 0 . 6 , 2 . 8 ] ) , and between combination and tamsulosin of - 26 . 9 % ( P < 0 . 001 ; [ 95 % CI : - 28 . 9 , - 24 . 9 ] ) .
Similar changes were seen at Month 48 : - 27 . 3 % ( ± 24 . 91 ) for combination therapy , - 28 . 0 % ( ± 25 . 74 ) for DUTASTERIDE , and + 4 . 6 % ( ± 35 . 45 ) for tamsulosin .
