The clinical significance of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse ' s antimicrobial activities is not clear .
Microbiological sampling of plaque has shown a general reduction of counts of certain assayed bacteria , both aerobic and anaerobic , ranging from 54 - 97 % through six months ' use .
Use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse USP , 0 . 12 % in a six - month clinical study did not result in any significant changes in bacterial resistance , overgrowth of potentially opportunistic organisms or other adverse changes in the oral microbial ecosystem .
Three months after chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse USP , 0 . 12 % use was discontinued , the number of bacteria in plaque had returned to baseline levels and resistance of plaque bacteria to chlorhexidine gluconate was equal to that at baseline .
PHARMACOKINETICS Pharmacokinetic studies with a chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse USP , 0 . 12 % indicate approximately 30 % of the active ingredient is retained in the oral cavity following rinsing .
This retained drug is slowly released into the oral fluids .
Studies conducted on human subjects and animals demonstrate chlorhexidine gluconate is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract .
The mean plasma level of chlorhexidine gluconate reached a peak of 0 . 206 µg / g in humans 30 minutes after they ingested a 300 - mg dose of the drug .
Detectable levels of chlorhexidine gluconate were not present in the plasma of these subjects 12 hours after the compound was administered .
Excretion of chlorhexidine gluconate occurred primarily through the feces ( ~ 90 % ) .
Less than 1 % of the chlorhexidine gluconate ingested by these subjects was excreted in the urine .

PRECAUTIONS General 1 .
For patients having coexisting gingivitis and periodontitis , the presence or absence of gingival inflammation following treatment with PerioGard ® ( Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse USP , 0 . 12 % ) should not be used as a major indicator of underlying periodontitis .
2 .
PerioGard ® can cause staining of oral surfaces , such as tooth surfaces , restorations , and the dorsum of the tongue .
Not all patients will experience a visually significant increase in tooth staining .
In clinical testing , 56 % of the chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse USP , 0 . 12 % users exhibited a measurable increase in facial anterior stain , compared to 35 % of control users after six months ; 15 % of the chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse USP , 0 . 12 % users developed what was judged to be heavy stain , compared to 1 % of control users after six months .
Stain will be more pronounced in patients who have heavier accumulations of unremoved plaque .
Stain resulting from the use of PerioGard ® does not adversely affect health of the gingivae or other oral tissues .
Stain can be removed from most tooth surfaces by conventional professional prophylactic techniques .
Additional time may be required to complete the prophylaxis .
Discretion should be used when prescribing to patients with anterior facial restorations with rough surfaces or margins .
If natural stain cannot be removed from these surfaces by a dental prophylaxis , patients should be excluded from PerioGard ® treatment if permanent discoloration is unacceptable .
Stain in these areas may be difficult to remove by dental prophylaxis and on rare occasions may necessitate replacement of these restorations .

Rare instances of permanent taste alteration following chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse USP , 0 . 12 % use have been reported via postmarketing product surveillance .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at chlorhexidine gluconate doses up to 300 mg / kg / day and 40 mg / kg / day , respectively , and have not revealed evidence of harm to fetus .
However , adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women have not been done .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when PerioGard ® ( Chlorhexidine Gluconate Oral Rinse USP , 0 . 12 % ) is administered to nursing women .

Mutagenic effects were not observed in two mammalian in vivo mutagenesis studies with chlorhexidine gluconate .
The highest doses of chlorhexidine used in a mouse dominant - lethal assay and a hamster cytogenetics test were 1000 mg / kg / day and 250 mg / kg / day , respectively .
No evidence of impaired fertility was observed in rats at doses up to 100 mg / kg / day .
