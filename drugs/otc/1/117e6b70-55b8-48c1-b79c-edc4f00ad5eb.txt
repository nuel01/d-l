( 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 ) 2 . 1 Recommended Dosage and Administration Adult Patients The recommended intravenous dose range for adult patients for lung imaging is 37 MBq to 148 MBq ( 1 mCi to 4 mCi ) and 200 , 000 to 700 , 000 particles of Technetium Tc 99 m Albumin Aggregated Injection after preparation with oxidant - free Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m Injection .
The recommended intraperitoneal dosage range for adult patients for peritoneovenous shunt patency evaluation is 37 MBq to 111 MBq ( 1 mCi to 3 mCi ) and 200 , 000 to 700 , 000 particles .
Adequate measures should be taken to assure uniform mixing with peritoneal fluid .
Serial images of both the shunt and target organ should be obtained and correlated with other clinical findings .
Alternatively , the drug may be administered by percutaneous transtubal injection .
The recommended percutaneous transtubal dosage range for adult patients is 12 MBq to 37 MBq ( 0 . 3 mCi to 1 mCi ) in a volume not to exceed 0 . 5 mL .
The recommended range of particle numbers per single injection is 200 , 000 to 700 , 000 with the recommended number of approximately 350 , 000 .
Depending on the activity added and volume of the final reconstituted product , the volume of the dose may vary from 0 . 2 mL to 1 . 9 mL .
The number of particles available per dose of Technetium Tc 99 m Albumin Aggregated Injection will vary depending on the physical decay of technetium Tc 99 m that has occurred .
The number of particles in any dose and volume to be administrated may be calculated as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Where : VTc = volume of solution added to reaction vial D = desired dose to be administered in MBq ( mCi ) C = concentration at calibration time of Sodium Pertechnetate solution to be added to the reaction vial in MBq / mL ( mCi / mL ) Va = volume to be administered in mL P = number of particles in dose to be administered Fr = fraction of Technetium Tc 99 m remaining after the time of calibration ( Table 7 ) N = number of particles per vial .
The number of particles per vial for the lot is located on the vial label .
Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients , the recommended intravenous dose for perfusion lung imaging is in the range of 0 . 925 MBq / kg to 1 . 85 MBq / kg ( 0 . 025 mCi / kg to 0 . 05 mCi / kg ) of body weight ; a usual dose is 1 . 11 MBq / kg ( 0 . 03 mCi / kg ) , except in newborns , in whom the administered dose should be 7 . 4 MBq to 18 . 5 MBq ( 0 . 2 mCi to 0 . 5 mCi ) .
Not less than the minimum dose of 7 . 4 MBq ( 0 . 2 mCi ) should be employed for this procedure .
The number of particles varies with age and weight as shown in Table 1 .

Measure the patient dose by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration .
Mix the contents of the vial by gentle inversion just prior to withdrawing a patient dose .
Mix the contents of the syringe just before injection .
If blood is drawn into the syringe , any unnecessary delay prior to injection may lead to clot formation .
For optimal results and because of rapid lung clearance of the radiopharmaceutical , position the patient under the imaging apparatus before administration .
Slow injection is recommended .
Lung imaging may begin immediately after intravenous injection of the radiopharmaceutical .
Due to high kidney uptake , imaging later than one - half hour after administration will yield poor results .

• Wear waterproof gloves during the entire preparation procedure and during subsequent patient dose withdrawals from the Pulmotech MAA vial .
• Make all transfers of sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m injection solution during the preparation procedure with an adequately shielded syringe .
• Keep the Radioactive Preparation in the Dispensing Vial Shield described below ( with cap in place ) during the useful life of the Radioactive Preparation .
Make all withdrawals and injections of the Radioactive Preparation with an adequately shielded syringe .
Procedure for the Preparation of Technetium Tc 99 m Albumin Aggregated 1 .
If Pulmotech MAA vials are stored in the refrigerator , remove a vial and allow the contents to come to room temperature for approximately 5 minutes .
2 .
Remove the protective disc from the Pulmotech MAA vial and swab the rubber septum with an alcohol swab or a suitable bacteriostatic agent to disinfect the surface .
3 .
Place the vial in a suitable dispensing vial shield fitted with a shielded cap .
4 .
Calculate the amount of sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m injection solution ( 2 mL to 13 mL ) to be added to the Pulmotech MAA vial .
During or prior to addition of technetium Tc 99 m solution do not vent the Pulmotech MAA vial .
In choosing the amount of technetium Tc 99 m radioactivity to be used in the preparation of technetium Tc 99 m albumin aggregated ensure that the radioactive dose will contain the desired number of MAA particles , while taking into account the number of patients , administered radioactive dose , and radioactive decay .
The recommended maximum amountof technetium Tc 99 m to be added to the Pulmotech vial is 6 . 85 GBq ( 185 mCi ) .
Calculate ( see section 2 . 1 ) the amount of radioactivity per vial required to be added to maintain the number of particles per dose within a recommended range [ for adults 200 , 000 to 700 , 000 , and for pediatric patients as per Table 1 ] .
5 .
After adding sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m injection solution to the Pulmotech MAA vial in the dispensing Vial shield ( with cap in place ) , mix the contents by agitation and allow to stand for a minimum of 15 minutes at room temperature .
Once prepared the product will have a turbid white appearance .
6 .
Assay the product in a suitable dose calibrator and record the activity of the technetium Tc 99 m albumin aggregated , total suspension volume , number of Tc 99 m MAA particles , radioactive concentration , time and date of preparation , onto the radioassay information label and attach it to the dispensing vial shield .
0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP may be used as a diluent for the radiolabeled product to achieve the desired number of particles and radioactivity .
7 .
Prior to withdrawing a dose , gently agitate the contents of the radiolabeled Pulmotech MAA vial to resuspend any settled technetium Tc 99 m albumin aggregated particles .
Failure to mix the reaction vial contents adequately before use may result in a non - homogenous suspension with a resulting non - uniform distribution of radioactivity in the lung .
Withdrawals for administration must be made aseptically using a sterile needle ( 18 to 21 gauge ) and syringe .
Since the vials contain nitrogen to prevent oxidation of the complex , the vials should not be vented .
If repeated withdrawals are made from the vial , the contents should not be replaced with air .
8 .
Store the radiolabeled Pulmotech MAA vial in the dispensing vial shield in a refrigerator at 2 ° to 8 ° C ( 36 ° to 46 ° F ) .
Use radiolabeled Pulmotech MAAwithin 18 hours from the time of preparation .
Discard unused product .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Temporarily discontinue breastfeeding and discard breast milk for 13 hours after administration .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from case reports on Technetium Tc 99 m Albumin Aggregated Injection are insufficient to evaluate drug - associated risks of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Animal reproduction studies with technetium Tc 99 m Albumin Aggregated Injection have not been conducted .
All radiopharmaceuticals have the potential to cause fetal harm depending on the fetal stage of development and the magnitude of the radiation dose .
If considering Technetium Tc 99 m Albumin Aggregated Injection administration to a pregnant woman , inform the patient about the potential for adverse pregnancy outcomes based on the radiation dose from Technetium Tc 99 m Albumin Aggregated Injection and the gestational timing of exposure .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Data available in the published literature demonstrate the presence of pertechnetate in human milk .
There are no data available on the effects of Tc - 99 m Albumin Aggregated Injection on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production .
Exposure of pertechnetate to a breast fed infant can be minimized by temporary discontinuation of breastfeeding ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for a Technetium Tc 99 m Albumin Aggregated Injection , any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from radioactivity and from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations To decrease radiation exposure to the breastfed infant , advise a lactating woman to pump and discard breast milk after the administration of Technetium Tc 99 m Albumin Aggregated Injection for 13 hours , where the duration corresponds to the typical range of administered activity , 37 to 148 MBq ( 1 to 4 mCi ) .
During the period of interruption , the breasts should be emptied regularly and completely .
The milk that is pumped by the mother during the time of breastfeeding interruption can either be discarded or stored refrigerated and given to the infant after 10 physical half - lives , or about 60 hours , have elapsed .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Technetium Tc 99 m Albumin Aggregated Injection is indicated for lung scintigraphy as an adjunct in the evaluation of pulmonary perfusion in pediatric patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
The safety profile of Technetium Tc99m Albumin Aggregated Injection is similar to the one in adults .
11 DESCRIPTION Pulmotech MAA ( kit for the preparation of technetium Tc 99 m albumin aggregated injection ) , when prepared with sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m injection , provides Technetium Tc 99 m Albumin Aggregated Injection .
Pulmotech MAA contains macroaggregates of U . S . - licensed human serum albumin ( non - reactive when tested for hepatitis B antigen ( HBsAg ) by enzyme immunoassay ) .
The macroaggregated albumin ( MAA ) is obtained by heat denaturation of stannous chloride treated human serum albumin under controlled conditions .
Upon radiolabeling with sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m injection solution , the stannous reduced Tc99m binds to the aggregated albumin to provide technetium Tc 99 m albumin aggregated .
The particle size distribution of the aggregated albumin is such that not less than 90 percent are 10 to 90 microns in size .
There are no aggregated albumin particles greater than 150 microns in size as determined by circular equivalents .
Pulmotech MAA is provided as a 15 mL multiple - dose glass vial containing white lyophilized powder .
The contents of the vial are under nitrogen .
Each vial contains 2 mg of albumin aggregated , 7 . 1 mg of albumin human ( soluble ) , 0 . 22 mg of maximum total tin ( as SnCl2 · 2H2O ) , 0 . 1 mg ( minimum ) stannous chloride , and 9 mg of sodium chloride .
Hydrochloric acid is added for pH adjustment and the pH of the reconstituted solution is between 5 and 7 .
The kit does not contain any bacteriostatic agent .
11 . 1 Physical Characteristics Technetium Tc 99 m decays by isomeric transition with a physical half - life of 6 . 02 hours . The principal photon that is useful for detection and imaging is listed in Table 5 .
Table 5 – Principal Radiation Emission DataRadiation Mean % per Disintegration Energy ( keV ) Gamma - 2 89 . 07 140 . 5 11 . 2 External Radiation The specific gamma ray constant for Technetium Tc 99 m is 0 . 78 R / mCi - hr at 1 cm .
The first half - value thickness of lead ( Pb ) for Technetium Tc 99 m is 0 . 017 cm .
A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 6 .
For example , the use of 0 . 25 cm of Pb will decrease the external radiation exposure by a factor of about 1000 .

Following intraperitoneal administration of Technetium Tc 99 m Albumin Aggregated Injection , the radiopharmaceutical mixes with the peritoneal fluid .
Clearance from the peritoneal cavity varies from insignificant , which may occur with complete shunt blockage , to very rapid clearance with subsequent transfer into the systemic circulation when the shunt is patent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Organ selectivity is a direct result of particle size .
At 10 microns and below , the albumin aggregates are taken up by the reticuloendothelial system .
Above 10 to 15 microns , the aggregates become lodged in the lung capillaries by a purely mechanical process .
Distribution of aggregated albumin in the lungs is a function of regional pulmonary blood flow .
The albumin aggregated is sufficiently fragile for the capillary micro - occlusion to be temporary .
Erosion and fragmentation reduce the particle size , allowing passage of the aggregates through the pulmonary alveolar capillary bed .
The fragments then accumulate in the reticuloendothelial system .
Elimination Elimination of the Technetium Tc 99 m Albumin Aggregates from the normal and abnormal human lungs occurs with a biological half - life of 10 . 8 hours ( range 6 . 9 to 19 hours , n = 5 ) .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No long - term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or whether technetium Tc 99 m albumin aggregated affects fertility in males or females .
