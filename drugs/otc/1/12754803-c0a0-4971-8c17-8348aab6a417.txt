• rifampin due to decreased BIC plasma concentrations , which may result in the loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance to BIKTARVY [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 5 ) ] .
BIKTARVY is contraindicated to be co - administered with : • dofetilide .
( 4 ) • rifampin .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Immune reconstitution syndrome : May necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
( 5 . 3 ) • New onset or worsening renal impairment : Assess serum creatinine , estimated creatinine clearance , urine glucose and urine protein when initiating BIKTARVY and during therapy as clinically appropriate in all patients .
Also assess serum phosphorus in patients with chronic kidney disease .
( 5 . 4 ) • Lactic acidosis / severe hepatomegaly with steatosis : Discontinue treatment in patients who develop symptoms or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity .
( 5 . 5 ) 5 . 1 Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients Coinfected with HIV - 1 and HBV Patients with HIV - 1 should be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection before or when initiating antiretroviral therapy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B ( e . g . , liver decompensation and liver failure ) have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HIV - 1 and HBV and have discontinued products containing FTC and / or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) , and may occur with discontinuation of BIKTARVY .
Patients coinfected with HIV - 1 and HBV who discontinue BIKTARVY should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow - up for at least several months after stopping treatment .
If appropriate , anti - hepatitis B therapy may be warranted , especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis , since post - treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure .
5 . 2 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions The concomitant use of BIKTARVY with certain other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions , some of which may lead to [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 5 ) ] : • Loss of therapeutic effect of BIKTARVY and possible development of resistance .
• Possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs .
See Table 3 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions , including dosing recommendations .
Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during BIKTARVY therapy ; review concomitant medications during BIKTARVY therapy ; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs .
5 . 3 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections [ such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia ( PCP ) , or tuberculosis ] , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
Autoimmune disorders ( such as Graves ' disease , polymyositis , Guillain - Barré syndrome , and autoimmune hepatitis ) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution ; however , the time to onset is more variable , and can occur many months after initiation of treatment .
5 . 4 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment Postmarketing cases of renal impairment , including acute renal failure , proximal renal tubulopathy ( PRT ) , and Fanconi syndrome , have been reported with TAF - containing products ; while most of these cases were characterized by potential confounders that may have contributed to the reported renal events , it is also possible these factors may have predisposed patients to tenofovir - related adverse events [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 , 6 . 2 ) ] .
BIKTARVY is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment ( estimated creatinine clearance of 15 to below 30 mL / min ) , or patients with ESRD ( estimated creatinine clearance below 15 mL / min ) who are not receiving chronic hemodialysis , or patients with no antiretroviral treatment history and ESRD who are receiving chronic hemodialysis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Patients taking tenofovir prodrugs who have impaired renal function and those taking nephrotoxic agents including non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs are at increased risk of developing renal - related adverse reactions .
Prior to or when initiating BIKTARVY , and during treatment with BIKTARVY , assess serum creatinine , estimated creatinine clearance , urine glucose and urine protein in all patients as clinically appropriate .
In patients with chronic kidney disease , also assess serum phosphorus .
Discontinue BIKTARVY in patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function or evidence of Fanconi syndrome .
5 . 5 Lactic Acidosis / Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis , including fatal cases , have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs , including emtricitabine , a component of BIKTARVY , and tenofovir DF , another prodrug of tenofovir , alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals .
Treatment with BIKTARVY should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity ( which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations ) .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling : • Severe Acute Exacerbations of Hepatitis B [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
• Immune Reconstitution Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
• New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
• Lactic Acidosis / Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Most common adverse reactions ( incidence greater than or equal to 5 % , all grades ) are diarrhea , nausea , and headache .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Clinical Trials in Adults with No Antiretroviral Treatment History The primary safety assessment of BIKTARVY was based on data from two randomized , double - blind , active - controlled trials , Trial 1489 and Trial 1490 , that enrolled 1274 HIV - 1 infected adult subjects with no antiretroviral treatment history through Week 144 .
After Week 144 , subjects received open - label BIKTARVY in an optional extension phase for an additional 96 weeks ( end of study ) .
A total of 634 and 1025 subjects received one tablet of BIKTARVY once daily during the double - blind ( Week 144 ) and extension phases , respectively [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The most common adverse reactions ( all Grades ) reported in at least 5 % of subjects in the BIKTARVY group in either Trial 1489 or Trial 1490 were diarrhea , nausea , and headache .
The proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment through Week 144 with BIKTARVY , abacavir [ ABC ] / dolutegravir [ DTG ] / lamivudine [ 3 TC ] ) , or DTG + FTC / TAF , due to adverse events , regardless of severity , was 1 % , 2 % , and 2 % , respectively .
Table 1 displays the frequency of adverse reactions ( all Grades ) greater than or equal to 2 % in the BIKTARVY group .
Table 1 Adverse Reactions [ 1 ] ( All Grades ) Reported in ≥ 2 % of HIV - 1 Infected Adults with No Antiretroviral Treatment History Receiving BIKTARVY in Trials 1489 or 1490 ( Week 144 analysis ) Trial 1489 Trial 1490 Adverse Reactions BIKTARVY N = 314 ABC / DTG / 3 TC N = 315 BIKTARVY N = 320 DTG + FTC / TAF N = 325 Diarrhea 6 % 4 % 3 % 3 % Nausea 6 % 18 % 3 % 5 % Headache 5 % 5 % 4 % 3 % Fatigue 3 % 4 % 2 % 2 % Abnormal dreams 3 % 3 % < 1 % 1 % Dizziness 2 % 3 % 2 % 1 % Insomnia 2 % 3 % 2 % < 1 % Abdominal distention 2 % 2 % 1 % 2 % [ 1 ] Frequencies of adverse reactions are based on all adverse events attributed to trial drugs by the investigator .
No adverse reactions of Grade 2 or higher occurred in > 1 % of subjects treated with BIKTARVY .
Additional adverse reactions ( all Grades ) occurring in less than 2 % of subjects administered BIKTARVY in Trials 1489 and 1490 included vomiting , flatulence , dyspepsia , abdominal pain , rash , and depression .
Suicidal ideation , suicide attempt , and depression suicidal occurred in 2 % of subjects administered BIKTARVY ; these events occurred primarily in subjects with a preexisting history of depression , prior suicide attempt or psychiatric illness .
The majority ( 84 % ) of adverse events associated with BIKTARVY were Grade 1 .
Adverse reactions in the open - label extension phases of Trials 1489 and 1490 were similar to those observed in subjects administered BIKTARVY in the Week 144 analysis .
Clinical Trials in Virologically Suppressed Adults The safety of BIKTARVY in virologically - suppressed adults was based on Week 48 data from 282 subjects in a randomized , double - blind , active - controlled trial ( Trial 1844 ) in which virologically - suppressed subjects were switched from either DTG + ABC / 3 TC or ABC / DTG / 3 TC to BIKTARVY ; and Week 48 data from 290 subjects in an open - label , active - controlled trial in which virologically - suppressed subjects were switched from a regimen containing atazanavir ( ATV ) ( given with cobicistat or ritonavir ) or darunavir ( DRV ) ( given with cobicistat or ritonavir ) plus either FTC / TDF or ABC / 3 TC , to BIKTARVY ( Trial 1878 ) .
Overall , the safety profile in virologically - suppressed adult subjects in Trials 1844 and 1878 was similar to that in subjects with no antiretroviral treatment history [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Clinical Trial in Adults with End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) Receiving Chronic Hemodialysis The safety of FTC and TAF ( components of BIKTARVY ) was evaluated in a single arm , open - label trial ( Trial 1825 ) in virologically - suppressed adults with ESRD ( estimated creatinine clearance of less than 15 mL / min ) on chronic hemodialysis treated with FTC + TAF in combination with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed - dose combination tablet for 96 weeks ( N = 55 ) .
The most commonly reported adverse reaction ( adverse event assessed as causally related by investigator and all grades ) was nausea ( 7 % ) .
Serious adverse events were reported in 65 % of subjects and the most common serious adverse events were pneumonia ( 15 % ) , fluid overload ( 7 % ) , hyperkalemia ( 11 % ) and osteomyelitis ( 7 % ) .
Overall 7 % of subjects permanently discontinued treatment due to an adverse event .
In an extension phase of Trial 1825 in which 10 subjects switched to BIKTARVY for 48 weeks , the safety findings were similar to those in the initial phase of the open - label trial [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Laboratory Abnormalities The frequency of laboratory abnormalities ( Grades 3 – 4 ) occurring in at least 2 % of subjects receiving BIKTARVY in Trials 1489 and 1490 are presented in Table 2 .
Table 2 Laboratory Abnormalities ( Grades 3 – 4 ) Reported in ≥ 2 % of Subjects Receiving BIKTARVY in Trials 1489 or 1490 ( Week 144 analysis ) Trial 1489 Trial 1490 Laboratory Parameter Abnormality [ 1 ] BIKTARVY N = 314 ABC / DTG / 3 TC N = 315 BIKTARVY N = 320 DTG + FTC / TAF N = 325 ULN = Upper limit of normal Amylase ( > 2 . 0 × ULN ) 3 % 4 % 3 % 4 % ALT ( > 5 . 0 × ULN ) 2 % 2 % 3 % 1 % AST ( > 5 . 0 × ULN ) 5 % 3 % 2 % 3 % Creatine Kinase ( ≥ 10 . 0 × ULN ) 8 % 8 % 6 % 4 % Neutrophils ( < 750 mm3 ) 3 % 4 % 3 % 2 % LDL - cholesterol ( fasted ) ( > 190 mg / dL ) 5 % 5 % 4 % 6 % Lipase ( > 3 . 0 × ULN ) [ 2 ] 2 % 2 % < 1 % 2 % GGT ( > 5 . 0 × ULN ) 2 % 2 % 1 % 1 % [ 1 ] Frequencies are based on treatment - emergent laboratory abnormalities .
[ 2 ] Lipase test performed only in subjects with serum amylase > 1 . 5 × ULN .
Changes in Serum Creatinine : BIC has been shown to increase serum creatinine due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting renal glomerular function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Increases in serum creatinine occurred by Week 4 of treatment and remained stable through Week 144 .
In Trials 1489 and 1490 , median ( Q1 , Q3 ) serum creatinine increased by 0 . 11 ( 0 . 03 , 0 . 19 ) mg per dL from baseline to Week 144 in the BIKTARVY group and was similar to the comparator groups who received ABC / DTG / 3 TC , or DTG + FTC / TAF .
There were no discontinuations due to renal adverse events and renal serious adverse events were encountered in less than 1 % of participants treated with BIKTARVY through Week 144 in clinical trials .
Changes in Bilirubin : In Trials 1489 and 1490 , total bilirubin increases were observed in 17 % of subjects administered BIKTARVY through Week 144 .
Increases were primarily Grade 1 ( 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 × ULN ) ( 12 % ) and Grade 2 ( 1 . 5 to 2 . 5 × ULN ) ( 4 % ) .
Graded bilirubin increases in the ABC / DTG / 3 TC , and DTG + FTC / TAF groups , were 7 % and 8 % , respectively .
Increases were primarily Grade 1 ( 5 % ABC / DTG / 3 TC and 7 % DTG + FTC / TAF ) or Grade 2 ( 2 % ABC / DTG / 3 TC and 2 % DTG + FTC / TAF ) .
There were no discontinuations due to hepatic adverse events through Week 144 in BIKTARVY clinical studies .
Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects The safety of BIKTARVY was evaluated in HIV - 1 infected virologically - suppressed subjects between the ages of 12 to less than 18 years and weighing at least 35 kg ( N = 50 ) through Week 48 ( cohort 1 ) , in virologically - suppressed subjects between the ages of 6 to less than 12 years and weighing at least 25 kg ( N = 50 ) through Week 24 ( cohort 2 ) , and in virologically suppressed subjects at least 2 years of age and weighing at least 14 to less than 25 kg ( N = 22 ) through Week 24 ( cohort 3 ) in an open label clinical trial ( Trial 1474 ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
No new adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities were identified compared to those observed in adults .
Adverse reactions were reported in 11 % of pediatric subjects .
The majority ( 76 % ) of adverse reactions were Grade 1 .
No Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were reported .
The adverse reaction reported by more than one subject ( regardless of severity ) was abdominal discomfort ( n = 2 ) .
One subject ( 1 % ) had Grade 2 adverse reactions of insomnia and anxiety that led to discontinuation of BIKTARVY .
The other adverse reactions that occurred in single subjects were similar to those seen in adults .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following events have been identified during post approval use of BIKTARVY or products containing TAF .
Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Renal and Urinary Disorders Acute renal failure , acute tubular necrosis , proximal renal tubulopathy , and Fanconi syndrome Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Angioedema , Stevens - Johnson syndrome / toxic epidermal necrolysis , and urticaria 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Because BIKTARVY is a complete regimen , coadministration with other antiretroviral medications for the treatment of HIV - 1 infection is not recommended .
( 7 . 1 ) • Consult the Full Prescribing Information prior to and during treatment for important drug interactions .
( 4 , 5 . 2 , 7 , 12 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Other Antiretroviral Medications Because BIKTARVY is a complete regimen , coadministration with other antiretroviral medications for the treatment of HIV - 1 infection is not recommended [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
Comprehensive information regarding potential drug - drug interactions with other antiretroviral medications is not provided because the safety and efficacy of concomitant HIV - 1 antiretroviral therapy is unknown .
7 . 2 Potential for BIKTARVY to Affect Other Drugs BIC inhibits organic cation transporter 2 ( OCT2 ) and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 1 ( MATE1 ) in vitro .
Coadministration of BIKTARVY with drugs that are substrates of OCT2 and MATE1 ( e . g . , dofetilide ) may increase their plasma concentrations ( see Table 3 ) .
7 . 3 Potential Effect of Other Drugs on One or More Components of BIKTARVY BIC is a substrate of CYP3A and UGT1A1 .
A drug that is a strong inducer of CYP3A and also an inducer of UGT1A1 can substantially decrease the plasma concentrations of BIC which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of BIKTARVY and development of resistance [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The use of BIKTARVY with a drug that is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A and also an inhibitor of UGT1A1 may significantly increase the plasma concentrations of BIC .
TAF is a substrate of P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) and breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) .
Co - administration of drugs that inhibit P - gp and BCRP may increase the absorption and plasma concentrations of TAF [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Co - administration of drugs that induce P - gp activity are expected to decrease the absorption of TAF , resulting in decreased plasma concentration of TAF , which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of BIKTARVY and development of resistance ( see Table 3 ) .
7 . 4 Drugs Affecting Renal Function Because FTC and tenofovir are primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion , coadministration of BIKTARVY with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of FTC , tenofovir , and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions .
Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include , but are not limited to , acyclovir , cidofovir , ganciclovir , valacyclovir , valganciclovir , aminoglycosides ( e . g . , gentamicin ) , and high - dose or multiple NSAIDs [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
7 . 5 Established and Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Table 3 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions with recommended prevention or management strategies .
The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with either BIKTARVY , the components of BIKTARVY ( BIC , FTC , and TAF ) as individual agents , or are drug interactions that may occur with BIKTARVY [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

7 . 6 Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with BIKTARVY Based on drug interaction studies conducted with BIKTARVY or the components of BIKTARVY , no clinically significant drug interactions have been observed when BIKTARVY is combined with the following drugs : ethinyl estradiol , ledipasvir / sofosbuvir , midazolam , norgestimate , sertraline , sofosbuvir , sofosbuvir / velpatasvir , and sofosbuvir / velpatasvir / voxilaprevir .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Women infected with HIV should be instructed not to breastfeed due to the potential for HIV transmission .
( 8 . 2 ) • Pediatrics : Not recommended for patients weighing less than 14 kg .
( 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to BIKTARVY during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry ( APR ) at 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
Risk Summary There are insufficient human data on the use of BIKTARVY during pregnancy to inform a drug - associated risk of birth defects and miscarriage .
Dolutegravir , another integrase inhibitor , has been associated with neural tube defects ( NTDs ) ( see Data ) .
Discuss the benefit - risk of using BIKTARVY with individuals of childbearing potential , particularly if pregnancy is being planned .
BIKTARVY use during pregnancy has been evaluated in a limited number of women reported to the APR ; consequently , there are insufficient BIC data from the APR to adequately assess the risk of major birth defects .
Reports of pregnant individuals treated with other drug products containing TAF or FTC contribute to APR ' s overall risk assessment for these components .
Available data from the APR show no statistically significant difference in the overall risk of major birth defects for FTC or TAF compared with the background rate for major birth defects of 2 . 7 % in a U . S . reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program ( MACDP ) ( see Data ) .
The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR .
The estimated background rate of miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies in the U . S . general population is 15 – 20 % .
In animal reproduction studies , no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed with the components of BIKTARVY at exposures that were either not maternally toxic ( rabbits ) or greater than ( rats and mice ) those in humans at the recommended human dose ( RHD ) ( see Data ) .
During organogenesis , systemic exposures ( AUC ) to BIC were approximately 36 ( rats ) and 0 . 6 times ( rabbits ) , to FTC were approximately 60 ( mice ) and 108 times ( rabbits ) , and to TAF were approximately 2 ( rats ) and 78 times ( rabbits ) the exposure at the RHD of BIKTARVY .
In rat pre / postnatal development studies , maternal systemic exposures ( AUC ) were 30 times ( BIC ) , 60 times ( FTC ) , and 19 times ( TDF ) the exposures of each component in humans at the RHD .
Data Human Data Prospective reports from the APR of overall major birth defects in pregnancies exposed to the components of BIKTARVY are compared with a U . S . background major birth defect rate .
Methodological limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group .
The MACDP population is not disease - specific , evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area , and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at less than 20 weeks gestation .
Bictegravir ( BIC ) : Data from an observational study in Botswana showed that dolutegravir , another integrase inhibitor , was associated with increased risk of neural tube defects when administered at the time of conception and in early pregnancy .
Data available to date from other sources including the APR , clinical trials , and postmarketing data are insufficient to address this risk with BIC .
There are an insufficient number of reports to the APR to adequately assess the risk of major birth defects associated with BIC exposure .
The APR has received prospective reports of 3 birth defects among 100 ( 3 . 0 % ) first trimester exposures to BIC - containing regimens during pregnancy resulting in live births .
No birth defects were reported among 40 exposures during the second / third trimester .
Emtricitabine ( FTC ) : Based on prospective reports to the APR of over 5 , 400 exposures to FTC - containing regimens during pregnancy resulting in live births ( including over 3 , 900 exposed in the first trimester and over 1 , 500 exposed in the second / third trimester ) , the prevalence of birth defects in live births was 2 . 6 % ( 95 % CI : 2 . 2 % to 3 . 2 % ) and 2 . 7 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 9 % to 3 . 7 % ) following first and second / third trimester exposure , respectively , to FTC - containing regimens .
Tenofovir Alafenamide ( TAF ) : Based on prospective reports to the APR of over 660 exposures to TAF - containing regimens during pregnancy resulting in live births ( including over 520 exposed in the first trimester and over 130 exposed in the second / third trimester ) , the prevalence of birth defects in live births was 4 . 2 % ( 95 % CI : 2 . 6 % to 6 . 3 % ) and 3 . 0 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 8 % to 7 . 5 % ) following first and second / third trimester exposure , respectively , to TAF - containing regimens .
Animal Data Bictegravir : BIC was administered orally to pregnant rats ( 5 , 30 , or 300 mg / kg / day ) and rabbits ( 100 , 300 , or 1000 mg / kg / day ) on gestation days 7 through 17 , and 7 through 19 , respectively .
No adverse embryo - fetal effects were observed in rats and rabbits at BIC exposures ( AUC ) of up to approximately 36 ( rats ) and 0 . 6 ( rabbits ) times the exposure in humans at the RHD of BIKTARVY .
Spontaneous abortion , increased clinical signs [ fecal changes , thin body , and cold - to - touch ] , and decreased body weight were observed at a maternally toxic dose in rabbits ( 1000 mg / kg / day ; approximately 1 . 4 times higher than human exposure at the RHD ) .
In a pre / postnatal development study , BIC was administered orally to pregnant rats ( up to 300 mg / kg / day ) from gestation days 6 to lactation / post - partum day 24 .
No significant adverse effects were observed in the offspring exposed daily from before birth ( in utero ) through lactation at maternal and pup exposures ( AUC ) of approximately 30 and 11 times higher , respectively , than human exposures at the RHD .
Emtricitabine : FTC was administered orally to pregnant mice ( 250 , 500 , or 1000 mg / kg / day ) and rabbits ( 100 , 300 , or 1000 mg / kg / day ) through organogenesis ( on gestation days 6 through 15 , and 7 through 19 , respectively ) .
No significant toxicological effects were observed in embryo - fetal toxicity studies performed with emtricitabine in mice at exposures approximately 60 times higher and in rabbits at approximately 108 times higher than human exposures at the RHD .
In a pre / postnatal development study with FTC , mice were administered doses up to 1000 mg / kg / day ; no significant adverse effects directly related to drug were observed in the offspring exposed daily from before birth ( in utero ) through sexual maturity at daily exposures ( AUC ) of approximately 60 times higher than human exposures at the RHD .
Tenofovir alafenamide : TAF was administered orally to pregnant rats ( 25 , 100 , or 250 mg / kg / day ) and rabbits ( 10 , 30 , or 100 mg / kg / day ) through organogenesis ( on gestation days 6 through 17 , and 7 through 20 , respectively ) .
No adverse embryo - fetal effects were observed in rats and rabbits at TAF exposures of approximately 2 ( rats ) and 78 ( rabbits ) times higher than the exposure in humans at the recommended daily dose of BIKTARVY .
TAF is rapidly converted to tenofovir ; the observed tenofovir exposure in rats and rabbits were 55 ( rats ) and 86 ( rabbits ) times higher than human tenofovir exposures at the RHD .
Since TAF is rapidly converted to tenofovir and lower tenofovir exposures in rats and mice were observed after TAF administration compared to TDF administration , a pre / postnatal development study in rats was conducted only with TDF .
Doses up to 600 mg / kg / day were administered through lactation ; no adverse effects were observed in the offspring on gestation day 7 [ and lactation day 20 ] at tenofovir exposures of approximately 12 [ 19 ] times higher than the exposures in humans at the RHD of BIKTARVY .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV - 1 - infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV - 1 infection .
It is not known whether BIKTARVY or all of the components of BIKTARVY are present in human breast milk , affects human milk production , or has effects on the breastfed infant .
Based on published data , FTC has been shown to be present in human breast milk .
BIC was detected in the plasma of nursing rat pups likely due to the presence of BIC in milk , and tenofovir has been shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats and rhesus monkeys after administration of TDF ( see Data ) .
It is unknown if TAF is present in animal milk .
Because of the potential for 1 ) HIV transmission ( in HIV - negative infants ) ; 2 ) developing viral resistance ( in HIV - positive infants ) ; and 3 ) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant similar to those seen in adults , instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving BIKTARVY .
Data Animal Data Bictegravir : BIC was detected in the plasma of nursing rat pups in the pre / postnatal development study ( post - natal day 10 ) , likely due to the presence of BIC in milk .
Tenofovir alafenamide : Studies in rats and monkeys have demonstrated that tenofovir is secreted in milk .
Tenofovir was excreted into the milk of lactating rats following oral administration of TDF ( up to 600 mg / kg / day ) at up to approximately 24 % of the median plasma concentration in the highest dosed animals at lactation day 11 .
Tenofovir was excreted into the milk of lactating monkeys following a single subcutaneous ( 30 mg / kg ) dose of tenofovir at concentrations up to approximately 4 % of plasma concentration , resulting in exposure ( AUC ) of approximately 20 % of plasma exposure .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of BIKTARVY have been established as a complete regimen for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) infection in pediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg who have no antiretroviral treatment history or to replace the current antiretroviral regimen in those who are virologically - suppressed ( HIV - 1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL ) on a stable antiretroviral regimen with no history of treatment failure and no known substitutions associated with resistance to the individual components of BIKTARVY [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 ) ] .
Use of BIKTARVY in pediatric patients weighing at least 14 kg is supported by the following : • trials in adults [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] • an open - label trial in three age - based cohorts of virologically - suppressed pediatric subjects [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] • Cohort 1 : 12 to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 35 kg receiving BIKTARVY through Week 48 ( N = 50 ) , • Cohort 2 : 6 to less than 12 years of age and weighing at least 25 kg receiving BIKTARVY through Week 24 ( N = 50 ) , and • Cohort 3 : at least 2 years of age and weighing at least 14 to less than 25 kg through Week 24 ( N = 22 ) .
No pediatric subjects 2 years of age were enrolled ; of the 6 pediatric subjects who were 3 years of age at enrollment , 3 subjects weighed between 14 to less than 15 kg .
The safety and efficacy of BIKTARVY in these pediatric subjects were similar to that in adults , and there was no clinically significant change in exposure for the components of BIKTARVY [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
Safety and effectiveness of BIKTARVY in pediatric patients weighing less than 14 kg have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials in virologically - suppressed subjects ( Trials 4449 , 1844 , and 1878 ) included 111 subjects aged 65 years and over who received BIKTARVY , including 86 patients from an open - label , single - arm trial of subjects aged 65 years and over who were switched from their previous antiretroviral regimen to BIKTARVY [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Of the total number of BIKTARVY - treated patients in these trials , 100 ( 90 % ) were 65 to 74 years of age , and 11 ( 10 % ) were 75 to 84 years of age .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly subjects and adults between 18 and less than 65 years of age , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics , safety , virologic and immunologic responses of FTC and TAF ( components of BIKTARVY ) were evaluated in a single arm , open - label trial ( Trial 1825 ) in virologically - suppressed adults with ESRD ( estimated creatinine clearance of less than 15 mL / min ) on chronic hemodialysis treated with FTC + TAF in combination with elvitegravir and cobicistat as a fixed - dose combination tablet for 96 weeks ( N = 55 ) .
In an extension phase of Trial 1825 , 10 virologically - suppressed subjects switched to BIKTARVY and all remained virologically suppressed for 48 weeks [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
No dosage adjustment of BIKTARVY is recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 30 mL / min , or in virologically - suppressed adults ( estimated creatinine clearance below 15 mL / min ) who are receiving chronic hemodialysis .
On days of hemodialysis , administer the daily dose of BIKTARVY after completion of hemodialysis treatment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] BIKTARVY is not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance of below 30 mL / min , by Cockcroft - Gault , or patients with ESRD ( estimated creatinine clearance below 15 mL / min ) who are not receiving chronic dialysis , or patients with no antiretroviral treatment history and ESRD who are receiving chronic dialysis , as the safety and / or efficacy of BIKTARVY has not been established in these populations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment of BIKTARVY is recommended in patients with mild ( Child - Pugh Class A ) or moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B ) hepatic impairment .
BIKTARVY has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) .
Therefore , BIKTARVY is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE No data are available on overdose of BIKTARVY in patients .
If overdose occurs , monitor the patient for evidence of toxicity .
Treatment of overdose with BIKTARVY consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient .
Hemodialysis treatment removes approximately 30 % of the FTC dose over a 3 - hour dialysis period starting within 1 . 5 hours of FTC dosing ( blood flow rate of 400 mL / min and a dialysate flow rate of 600 mL / min ) .
It is not known whether FTC can be removed by peritoneal dialysis .
Tenofovir is efficiently removed by hemodialysis with an extraction coefficient of approximately 54 % .

[ 2 ] Values refer to geometric mean ratio [ high - fat meal / fasting ] in PK parameters and ( 90 % confidence interval ) .
High fat meal is approximately 800 kcal , 50 % fat .
[ 3 ] t1 / 2 values refer to median ( Q1 , Q3 ) terminal plasma half - life .
Note that the active metabolite of TAF , tenofovir diphosphate , has a half - life of 150 – 180 hours within PBMCs .
[ 4 ] In vivo , TAF is hydrolyzed within cells to form tenofovir ( major metabolite ) , which is phosphorylated to the active metabolite , tenofovir diphosphate .
In vitro studies have shown that TAF is metabolized to tenofovir by cathepsin A in PBMCs and macrophages ; and by CES1 in hepatocytes .
[ 5 ] Dosing in mass balance studies : single dose administration of [ 14 C ] BIC ; single dose administration of [ 14 C ] FTC after multiple dosing of FTC for ten days ; single dose administration of [ 14 C ] TAF .

In a separate Phase 1 study of FTC alone , FTC exposures were increased in subjects with severe renal impairment .
The pharmacokinetics of BIC , FTC and TAF were evaluated in a subset of HIV - 1 infected virologically - suppressed subjects with ESRD ( estimated creatinine clearance less than 15 mL / min , by Cockcroft - Gault method ) receiving chronic hemodialysis in Trial 1825 .
The pharmacokinetics of TAF were similar between healthy subjects and subjects with ESRD receiving chronic hemodialysis ; increases in FTC and tenofovir exposures in subjects with ESRD were not considered clinically relevant .
Median ( minimum , maximum ) BIC Ctrough values in subjects ( n = 7 ) with ESRD who received BIKTARVY were 846 ng / mL ( 288 , 1810 ) compared to 2540 ng / mL ( 757 , 6499 ) in subjects ( N = 584 ) with normal renal function .
Despite significantly lower BIC Ctrough values in the virologically - suppressed ESRD population , virologic suppression was maintained [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Bictegravir : Clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of BIC were not observed in subjects with moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B ) hepatic impairment .
Emtricitabine : The pharmacokinetics of FTC has not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment ; however , FTC is not significantly metabolized by liver enzymes , so the impact of hepatic impairment should be limited .
Tenofovir Alafenamide : Clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of TAF or its metabolite tenofovir were not observed in subjects with mild or moderate ( Child - Pugh Class A and B ) hepatic impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Hepatitis B and / or Hepatitis C Virus Coinfection The pharmacokinetics of BIC , FTC , and TAF have not been evaluated in subjects coinfected with hepatitis B and / or C virus .
Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of BIC , FTC , and TAF have not been fully evaluated in the elderly ( 65 years of age and older ) .
Population pharmacokinetics analysis of HIV - infected subjects in Phase 3 trials of BIKTARVY showed that age did not have a clinically relevant effect on exposures of BIC and TAF up to 74 years of age [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Pediatric Patients Mean BIC Ctrough was lower in 50 pediatric patients aged 12 to less than 18 years and weighing at least 35 kg who received BIKTARVY in Trial 1474 relative to adults following administration of BIKTARVY , but was not considered clinically significant based on exposure - response relationships ; exposures of FTC and TAF in these pediatric patients were similar to those in adults ( Table 6 ) .

12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Bictegravir : BIC inhibits the strand transfer activity of HIV - 1 integrase ( integrase strand transfer inhibitor ; INSTI ) , an HIV - 1 encoded enzyme that is required for viral replication .
Inhibition of integrase prevents the integration of linear HIV - 1 DNA into host genomic DNA , blocking the formation of the HIV - 1 provirus and propagation of the virus .
Emtricitabine : FTC , a synthetic nucleoside analog of cytidine , is phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to form emtricitabine 5 ' - triphosphate .
Emtricitabine 5 ' - triphosphate inhibits the activity of the HIV - 1 reverse transcriptase by competing with the natural substrate deoxycytidine 5 ' - triphosphate and by being incorporated into nascent viral DNA which results in chain termination .
Emtricitabine 5 ′ - triphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases α , β , Ɛ , and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ .
Tenofovir Alafenamide : TAF is a phosphonamidate prodrug of tenofovir ( 2 ′ - deoxyadenosine monophosphate analog ) .
Plasma exposure to TAF allows for permeation into cells and then TAF is intracellularly converted to tenofovir through hydrolysis by cathepsin A . Tenofovir is subsequently phosphorylated by cellular kinases to the active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate .
Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HIV - 1 replication through incorporation into viral DNA by the HIV reverse transcriptase , which results in DNA chain - termination .
Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases that include mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ and there is no evidence of toxicity to mitochondria in cell culture .
Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture The triple combination of BIC , FTC , and TAF was not antagonistic with respect to antiviral activity in cell culture .
Bictegravir : The antiviral activity of BIC against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV - 1 was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines , PBMCs , primary monocyte / macrophage cells , and CD4 + T - lymphocytes .
In MT - 4 cells ( human lymphoblastoid T - cell line ) acutely infected with HIV - 1 IIIB , the mean 50 % effective concentration ( EC50 ) was 2 . 4 ± 0 . 4 nM , and the protein - adjusted EC95 value was 361 nM ( 0 . 162 micrograms per mL ) .
BIC displayed antiviral activity in activated PBMCs against clinical isolates of HIV - 1 representing groups M , N , and O , including subtypes A , B , C , D , E , F , and G , with a median EC50 value of 0 . 55 nM ( range < 0 . 05 to 1 . 71 nM ) .
The EC50 value against a single HIV - 2 isolate was 1 . 1 nM .
Emtricitabine : The antiviral activity of FTC against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV - 1 was assessed in T lymphoblastoid cell lines , the MAGI - CCR5 cell line , and PBMCs .
In PBMCs acutely infected with HIV - 1 subtypes A , B , C , D , E , F , and G , the median EC50 value for FTC was 9 . 5 nM ( range 1 to 30 nM ) and against HIV - 2 was 7 nM .
Tenofovir Alafenamide : The antiviral activity of TAF against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV - 1 subtype B was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines , PBMCs , primary monocyte / macrophage cells and CD4 - T lymphocytes .
The EC50 values for TAF ranged from 2 . 0 to 14 . 7 nM .
TAF displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against all HIV - 1 groups ( M , N , O ) , including subtypes A , B , C , D , E , F , and G ( EC50 values ranged from 0 . 1 to 12 nM ) and strain specific activity against HIV - 2 ( EC50 values ranged from 0 . 9 to 2 . 6 nM ) .
Resistance In Cell Culture Bictegravir : HIV - 1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to BIC have been selected in cell culture .
In one selection with BIC , a virus pool emerged expressing amino acid substitutions M50I and R263K in the HIV - 1 integrase .
M50I , R263K , and M50I + R263K substitutions , when introduced into a wild - type virus by site - directed mutagenesis , conferred 1 . 3 - , 2 . 2 - , and 2 . 9 - fold reduced susceptibility to BIC , respectively .
In a second selection , emergence of amino acid substitutions T66I and S153F was detected , and 0 . 4 - , 1 . 9 - , and 0 . 5 - fold reductions in BIC susceptibility were observed with T66I , S153F , and T66I + S153F , respectively .
In addition , S24G and E157K substitutions emerged during the selection process .
Emtricitabine : HIV - 1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to FTC were selected in cell culture and in subjects treated with FTC .
Reduced susceptibility to FTC was associated with M184V or I substitutions in HIV - 1 RT .
Tenofovir Alafenamide : HIV - 1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to TAF were selected in cell culture .
HIV - 1 isolates selected by TAF expressed a K65R substitution in HIV - 1 RT , sometimes in the presence of S68N or L429I substitutions ; in addition , a K70E substitution in HIV - 1 RT was observed .
In Clinical Trials In Subjects with No Antiretroviral Treatment History : Pooled results of genotypic resistance analyses were performed on paired baseline and on - treatment HIV - 1 isolates from subjects receiving BIKTARVY in Trials 1489 and 1490 through Week 144 of the double - blind phase ( N = 634 ) or Week 96 of the extension phase ( n = 1025 ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] who had HIV - 1 RNA greater than or equal to 200 copies / mL at the time of confirmed virologic failure or early study drug discontinuation .
In the final resistance analysis population , no specific amino acid substitutions emerged consistently in the 11 treatment failure subjects with evaluable genotypic resistance data and failed to establish an association with genotypic BIC resistance .
There were no treatment - emergent NRTI resistance - associated substitutions detected in the 11 evaluated treatment failure isolates .
Phenotypic resistance analyses of failure isolates found fold - changes in drug susceptibility below the biological or clinical cutoffs for BIC , FTC , and TFV , compared to wild - type reference HIV - 1 .
In Virologically Suppressed Adult Subjects : In 2 switch trials , Trials 1844 and 1878 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] , of virologically suppressed HIV - 1 infected subjects ( n = 572 ) , only one subject with virologic rebound in the resistance analysis population had IN genotypic and phenotypic data , and 2 rebounders had RT genotypic and phenotypic data .
No subjects had HIV - 1 with treatment - emergent genotypic or phenotypic resistance to BIC , FTC , or TAF .
In Virologically Suppressed Pediatric Subjects : In Trial 1474 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] , two of 50 subjects in cohort 1 were evaluated for the development of resistance through Week 48 ; no amino acid substitutions known to be associated with resistance to BIC , FTC , or TFV were detected .
No subjects in cohort 2 or 3 met the criteria for resistance analyses through Week 24 .
Cross - Resistance Bictegravir : Cross - resistance has been observed among INSTIs .
The susceptibility of BIC was tested against 64 clinical isolates expressing known INSTI resistance - associated substitutions listed by IAS - USA ( 20 with single substitutions and 44 with 2 or more substitutions ) .
Isolates with a single INSTI - resistance substitution including E92Q , T97A , Y143C / R , Q148R , and N155H showed less than 2 - fold reduced susceptibility to BIC .
All isolates ( n = 14 ) with more than 2 . 5 - fold reduced susceptibility to BIC ( above the biological cutoff for BIC ) contained G140A / C / S and Q148H / R / K substitutions ; the majority ( 64 . 3 % , 9 / 14 ) had a complex INSTI resistance pattern with an additional INSTI - resistance substitution L74M , T97A , or E138A / K .
Of those evaluated isolates containing G140A / C / S and Q148H / R / K substitutions in the absence of additional INSTI - resistance substitutions , 38 . 5 % ( 5 / 13 ) showed more than 2 . 5 - fold reduction .
In addition , site - directed mutant viruses with G118R ( dolutegravir and raltegravir treatment - emergent substitution ) and G118R + T97A had 3 . 4 - and 2 . 8 - fold reduced susceptibility to BIC , respectively .
BIC demonstrated equivalent antiviral activity with less than 2 - fold reductions in susceptibility against HIV - 1 variants expressing substitutions associated with resistance to NNRTIs , NRTIs , and PIs , compared with the wild - type virus .
Emtricitabine : Cross - resistance has been observed among NRTIs .
FTC - resistant viruses with an M184V / I substitution in HIV - 1 RT were cross - resistant to lamivudine .
HIV - 1 isolates containing the K65R RT substitution , selected in vivo by abacavir , didanosine , and tenofovir , demonstrated reduced susceptibility to inhibition by FTC .
Tenofovir Alafenamide : Cross - resistance has been observed among NRTIs .
Tenofovir resistance substitutions K65R and K70E result in reduced susceptibility to abacavir , didanosine , emtricitabine , lamivudine , and tenofovir .
HIV - 1 with multiple thymidine analog substitutions ( M41L , D67N , K70R , L210W , T215F / Y , K219Q / E / N / R ) , or multinucleoside resistant HIV - 1 with a T69S double insertion mutation or with a Q151M substitution complex including K65R , showed reduced susceptibility to TAF in cell culture .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Bictegravir BIC was not carcinogenic in a 6 - month rasH2 transgenic mouse study at doses of up to 100 mg / kg / day in males and 300 mg / kg / day in females .
BIC was not carcinogenic in a 2 - year rat study at doses up to 300 mg / kg / day , which resulted in exposures of approximately 31 times the exposure in humans at the recommended dose of BIKTARVY .
BIC was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial test ( Ames test ) , mouse lymphoma or rat micronucleus assays .
BIC did not affect fertility , reproductive performance or embryonic viability in male and female rats at 29 times higher exposures ( AUC ) than in humans at the recommended dose of BIKTARVY .
Emtricitabine In long - term carcinogenicity studies of FTC , no drug - related increases in tumor incidence were found in mice at doses up to 750 mg per kg per day ( 25 times the human systemic exposure at the recommended dose of BIKTARVY ) or in rats at doses up to 600 mg per kg per day ( 30 times the human systemic exposure at the recommended dose of BIKTARVY ) .
FTC was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial test ( Ames test ) , mouse lymphoma or mouse micronucleus assays .
FTC did not affect fertility in male rats at approximately 140 times or in male and female mice at approximately 60 times higher exposures ( AUC ) than in humans given the recommended dose of BIKTARVY .
Fertility was normal in the offspring of mice exposed daily from before birth ( in utero ) through sexual maturity at daily exposures ( AUC ) of approximately 60 times higher than human exposures at the recommended dose of BIKTARVY .
Tenofovir Alafenamide Since TAF is rapidly converted to tenofovir and a lower tenofovir exposure in rats and mice was observed after TAF administration compared to TDF administration , carcinogenicity studies were conducted only with TDF .
Long - term oral carcinogenicity studies of TDF in mice and rats were carried out at exposures up to approximately 10 times ( mice ) and 4 times ( rats ) those observed in humans following a 300 mg dose of TDF .
The tenofovir exposure in these studies was approximately 151 times ( mice ) and 51 times ( rat ) those observed in humans after administration of the daily recommended dose of BIKTARVY .
At the high dose in female mice , liver adenomas were increased at tenofovir exposures approximately 151 times the exposure observed in humans at the recommended dose of BIKTARVY .
In rats , the study was negative for carcinogenic findings .
TAF was not genotoxic in the reverse mutation bacterial test ( Ames test ) , mouse lymphoma or rat micronucleus assays .
There were no effects on fertility , mating performance or early embryonic development when TAF was administered to male rats at a dose equivalent to 155 times the human dose of BIKTARVY based on body surface area comparisons for 28 days prior to mating and to female rats for 14 days prior to mating through Day 7 of gestation .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Minimal to slight infiltration of mononuclear cells in the posterior uvea was observed in dogs with similar severity after three and nine month administration of TAF ; reversibility was seen after a three month recovery period .
No eye toxicity was observed in the dog at systemic exposures of 7 ( TAF ) and 14 ( tenofovir ) times the exposure seen in humans with the recommended daily dose of BIKTARVY .
