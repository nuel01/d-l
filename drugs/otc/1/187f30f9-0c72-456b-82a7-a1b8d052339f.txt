DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Doses should be individualized based on safety and efficacy .
Starting doses per indication are noted below .
Myelofibrosis ( 2 . 1 ) • The starting dose of Jakafi is based on patient ’ s baseline platelet count : • Greater than 200 x 109 / L : 20 mg given orally twice daily • 100 x 109 / L to 200 x 109 / L : 15 mg given orally twice daily • 50 x 109 / L to less than 100 x 109 / L : 5 mg given orally twice daily • Monitor complete blood counts every 2 to 4 weeks until doses are stabilized , and then as clinically indicated .
Modify or interrupt dosing for thrombocytopenia .
Polycythemia Vera ( 2 . 2 ) • The starting dose of Jakafi is 10 mg given orally twice daily .
Acute Graft - Versus - Host Disease ( 2 . 3 ) • The starting dose of Jakafi is 5 mg given orally twice daily .
Chronic Graft - Versus - Host Disease ( 2 . 4 ) • The starting dose of Jakafi is 10 mg given orally twice daily .
2 . 1 Myelofibrosis The recommended starting dose of Jakafi is based on platelet count ( Table 1 ) .
A complete blood count ( CBC ) and platelet count must be performed before initiating therapy , every 2 to 4 weeks until doses are stabilized , and then as clinically indicated [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Doses may be titrated based on safety and efficacy .
Table 1 : Jakafi Starting Doses for MyelofibrosisPlatelet Count Starting Dose Greater than 200 x 109 / L 20 mg orally twice daily 100 x 109 / L to 200 x 109 / L 15 mg orally twice daily 50 x 109 / L to less than 100 x 109 / L 5 mg orally twice daily Dose Modification Guidelines for Hematologic Toxicity for Patients with Myelofibrosis Starting Treatment with a Platelet Count of 100 x 109 / L or Greater Treatment Interruption and Restarting Dosing Interrupt treatment for platelet counts less than 50 x 109 / L or absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) less than 0 . 5 x 109 / L .
After recovery of platelet counts above 50 x 109 / L and ANC above 0 . 75 x 109 / L , dosing may be restarted .
Table 2 illustrates the maximum allowable dose that may be used in restarting Jakafi after a previous interruption .
Table 2 : Myelofibrosis : Maximum Restarting Doses for Jakafi after Safety Interruption for Thrombocytopenia for Patients Starting Treatment with a Platelet Count of 100 x 109 / L or GreaterCurrent Platelet Count Maximum Dose When Restarting Jakafi Treatment [ 1 ] Greater than or equal to 125 x 109 / L 20 mg twice daily 100 to less than 125 x 109 / L 15 mg twice daily 75 to less than 100 x 109 / L 10 mg twice daily for at least 2 weeks ; if stable , may increase to 15 mg twice daily 50 to less than 75 x 109 / L 5 mg twice daily for at least 2 weeks ; if stable , may increase to 10 mg twice daily Less than 50 x 109 / L Continue hold [ 1 ] Maximum doses are displayed .
When restarting , begin with a dose at least 5 mg twice daily below the dose at interruption .
Following treatment interruption for ANC below 0 . 5 x 109 / L , after ANC recovers to 0 . 75 x 109 / L or greater , restart dosing at the higher of 5 mg once daily or 5 mg twice daily below the largest dose in the week prior to the treatment interruption .
Dose Reductions Dose reductions should be considered if the platelet counts decrease as outlined in Table 3 with the goal of avoiding dose interruptions for thrombocytopenia .

Doses should not be increased during the first 4 weeks of therapy and not more frequently than every 2 weeks .
Consider dose increases in patients who meet all of the following conditions : • Failure to achieve a reduction from pretreatment baseline in either palpable spleen length of 50 % or a 35 % reduction in spleen volume as measured by computed tomography ( CT ) or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ; • Platelet count greater than 125 x 109 / L at 4 weeks and platelet count never below 100 x 109 / L ; • ANC Levels greater than 0 . 75 x 109 / L .
Based on limited clinical data , long - term maintenance at a 5 mg twice daily dose has not shown responses and continued use at this dose should be limited to patients in whom the benefits outweigh the potential risks .
Discontinue Jakafi if there is no spleen size reduction or symptom improvement after 6 months of therapy .
Dose Modifications for Hematologic Toxicity for Patients with Myelofibrosis Starting Treatment with Platelet Counts of 50 x 109 / L to Less Than 100 x 109 / L This section applies only to patients with platelet counts of 50 x 109 / L to less than 100 x 109 / L prior to any treatment with Jakafi .
See dose modifications in Section 2 . 1 ( Dose Modification Guidelines for Hematological Toxicity for Patients with Myelofibrosis Starting Treatment with a Platelet Count of 100 x 109 / L or Greater ) for hematological toxicity in patients whose platelet counts were 100 x 109 / L or more prior to starting treatment with Jakafi .
Treatment Interruption and Restarting Dosing Interrupt treatment for platelet counts less than 25 x 109 / L or ANC less than 0 . 5 x 109 / L .
After recovery of platelet counts above 35 x 109 / L and ANC above 0 . 75 x 109 / L , dosing may be restarted .
Restart dosing at the higher of 5 mg once daily or 5 mg twice daily below the largest dose in the week prior to the decrease in platelet count below 25 x 109 / L or ANC below 0 . 5 x 109 / L that led to dose interruption .
Dose Reductions Reduce the dose of Jakafi for platelet counts less than 35 x 109 / L as described in Table 4 .
Table 4 : Myelofibrosis : Dosing Modifications for Thrombocytopenia for Patients with Starting Platelet Count of 50 x 109 / L to Less Than 100 x 109 / LPlatelet Count Dosing Recommendations Less than 25 x 109 / L • Interrupt dosing .
25 x 109 / L to less than 35 x 109 / L AND the platelet count decline is less than 20 % during the prior four weeks • Decrease dose by 5 mg once daily .
• For patients on 5 mg once daily , maintain dose at 5 mg once daily .
25 x 109 / L to less than 35 x 109 / L AND the platelet count decline is 20 % or greater during the prior four weeks • Decrease dose by 5 mg twice daily .
• For patients on 5 mg twice daily , decrease the dose to 5 mg once daily .
• For patients on 5 mg once daily , maintain dose at 5 mg once daily .
Dose Modifications Based on Insufficient Response for Patients with Myelofibrosis and Starting Platelet Count of 50 x 109 / L to Less Than 100 x 109 / L Do not increase doses during the first 4 weeks of therapy , and do not increase the dose more frequently than every 2 weeks .
If the response is insufficient as defined in Section 2 . 1 ( see Dose Modification Based on Insufficient Response with Myelofibrosis Starting Treatment with a platelet count of 100 x 109 / L or Greater ) , doses may be increased by increments of 5 mg daily to a maximum of 10 mg twice daily if : • the platelet count has remained at least 40 x 109 / L , and • the platelet count has not fallen by more than 20 % in the prior 4 weeks , and • the ANC is more than 1 x 109 / L , and • the dose has not been reduced or interrupted for an adverse event or hematological toxicity in the prior 4 weeks .
Continuation of treatment for more than 6 months should be limited to patients in whom the benefits outweigh the potential risks .
Discontinue Jakafi if there is no spleen size reduction or symptom improvement after 6 months of therapy .
Dose Modification for Bleeding Interrupt treatment for bleeding requiring intervention regardless of current platelet count .
Once the bleeding event has resolved , consider resuming treatment at the prior dose if the underlying cause of bleeding has been controlled .
If the bleeding event has resolved but the underlying cause persists , consider resuming treatment with Jakafi at a lower dose .
2 . 2 Polycythemia Vera The recommended starting dose of Jakafi is 10 mg twice daily .
Doses may be titrated based on safety and efficacy .
Dose Modification Guidelines for Patients with Polycythemia Vera A complete blood count ( CBC ) and platelet count must be performed before initiating therapy , every 2 to 4 weeks until doses are stabilized , and then as clinically indicated [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Dose Reductions Dose reductions should be considered for hemoglobin and platelet count decreases as described in Table 5 .
Table 5 : Polycythemia Vera : Dose ReductionsHemoglobin and / or Platelet Count Dosing Recommendations Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12 g / dL AND platelet count greater than or equal to 100 x 109 / L • No change required .
Hemoglobin 10 to less than 12 g / dL AND platelet count 75 to less than 100 x 109 / L • Dose reductions should be considered with the goal of avoiding dose interruptions for anemia and thrombocytopenia .
Hemoglobin 8 to less than 10 g / dL OR platelet count 50 to less than 75 x 109 / L • Reduce dose by 5 mg twice daily .
• For patients on 5 mg twice daily , decrease the dose to 5 mg once daily .
Hemoglobin less than 8 g / dL OR platelet count less than 50 x 109 / L • Interrupt dosing .
Treatment Interruption and Restarting Dosing Interrupt treatment for hemoglobin less than 8 g / dL , platelet counts less than 50 x 109 / L or ANC less than 1 . 0 x 109 / L .
After recovery of the hematologic parameter ( s ) to acceptable levels , dosing may be restarted .
Table 6 illustrates the dose that may be used in restarting Jakafi after a previous interruption .
Table 6 : Polycythemia Vera : Restarting Doses for Jakafi after Safety Interruption for Hematologic Parameter ( s ) Use the most severe category of a patient ’ s hemoglobin , platelet count , or ANC abnormality to determine the corresponding maximum restarting dose .
Hemoglobin , Platelet Count , or ANC Maximum Restarting Dose Hemoglobin less than 8 g / dL OR platelet count less than 50 x 109 / L OR ANC less than 1 x 109 / L Continue hold Hemoglobin 8 to less than 10 g / dL OR platelet count 50 to less than 75 x 109 / L OR ANC 1 to less than 1 . 5 x 109 / L 5 mg twice daily [ 1 ] or no more than 5 mg twice daily less than the dose which resulted in dose interruption Hemoglobin 10 to less than 12 g / dL OR platelet count 75 to less than 100 x 109 / L OR ANC 1 . 5 to less than 2 x 109 / L 10 mg twice daily null or no more than 5 mg twice daily less than the dose which resulted in dose interruption Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12 g / dL OR platelet count greater than or equal to 100 x 109 / L OR ANC greater than or equal to 2 x 109 / L 15 mg twice daily null or no more than 5 mg twice daily less than the dose which resulted in dose interruption [ 1 ] Continue treatment for at least 2 weeks ; if stable , may increase dose by 5 mg twice daily .
Patients who had required dose interruption while receiving a dose of 5 mg twice daily , may restart at a dose of 5 mg twice daily or 5 mg once daily , but not higher , once hemoglobin is greater than or equal to 10 g / dL , platelet count is greater than or equal to 75 x 109 / L , and ANC is greater than or equal to 1 . 5 x 109 / L .
Dose Management after Restarting Treatment After restarting Jakafi following treatment interruption , doses may be titrated , but the maximum total daily dose should not exceed 5 mg less than the dose that resulted in the dose interruption .
An exception to this is dose interruption following phlebotomy - associated anemia , in which case the maximal total daily dose allowed after restarting Jakafi would not be limited .
Dose Modifications Based on Insufficient Response for Patients with Polycythemia Vera If the response is insufficient and platelet , hemoglobin , and neutrophil counts are adequate , doses may be increased in 5 mg twice daily increments to a maximum of 25 mg twice daily .
Doses should not be increased during the first 4 weeks of therapy and not more frequently than every two weeks .
Consider dose increases in patients who meet all of the following conditions : • Inadequate efficacy as demonstrated by one or more of the following : • Continued need for phlebotomy • WBC greater than the upper limit of normal range • Platelet count greater than the upper limit of normal range • Palpable spleen that is reduced by less than 25 % from Baseline • Platelet count greater than or equal to 140 x 109 / L • Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 12 g / dL • ANC greater than or equal to 1 . 5 x 109 / L 2 . 3 Acute Graft - Versus - Host Disease The recommended starting dose of Jakafi is 5 mg given orally twice daily .
Consider increasing the dose to 10 mg twice daily after at least 3 days of treatment if the ANC and platelet counts are not decreased by 50 % or more relative to the first day of dosing with Jakafi .
Consider tapering Jakafi after 6 months of treatment in patients with response who have discontinued therapeutic doses of corticosteroids .
Taper Jakafi by one dose level approximately every 8 weeks ( 10 mg twice daily to 5 mg twice daily to 5 mg once daily ) .
If aGVHD signs or symptoms recur during or after the taper of Jakafi , consider retreatment .
Dose Modification Guidelines for Patients with Acute Graft - Versus - Host Disease Monitor complete blood counts ( CBC ) , including platelet count and ANC , and bilirubin prior to initiating therapy , every 2 to 4 weeks until doses are stabilized , and then as indicated clinically .
Modify the dose of Jakafi for adverse reactions as described in Table 7 .
For dose reductions , patients who are currently receiving Jakafi 10 mg twice daily may have their dose reduced to 5 mg twice daily ; patients receiving 5 mg twice daily may have their dose reduced to 5 mg once daily .
Patients who are unable to tolerate Jakafi at a dose of 5 mg once daily should have treatment interrupted until their clinical and / or laboratory parameters recover .

2 . 7 Method of Administration Jakafi is dosed orally and can be administered with or without food .
If a dose is missed , the patient should not take an additional dose , but should take the next usual prescribed dose .
When discontinuing Jakafi therapy for reasons other than thrombocytopenia , gradual tapering of the dose of Jakafi may be considered , for example by 5 mg twice daily each week .
For patients unable to ingest tablets , Jakafi can be administered through a nasogastric tube ( 8 French or greater ) as follows : • Suspend one tablet in approximately 40 mL of water with stirring for approximately 10 minutes .
• Within 6 hours after the tablet has dispersed , the suspension can be administered through a nasogastric tube using an appropriate syringe .
The tube should be rinsed with approximately 75 mL of water .
The effect of tube feeding preparations on Jakafi exposure during administration through a nasogastric tube has not been evaluated .

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Thrombocytopenia , Anemia and Neutropenia : Manage by dose reduction , or interruption , or transfusion .
( 5 . 1 ) • Risk of Infection : Assess patients for signs and symptoms of infection and initiate appropriate treatment promptly .
Serious infections should have resolved before starting therapy with Jakafi .
( 5 . 2 ) • Symptom Exacerbation Following Interruption or Discontinuation : Manage with supportive care and consider resuming treatment with Jakafi .
( 5 . 3 ) • Risk of Non - Melanoma Skin Cancer : Perform periodic skin examinations .
( 5 . 4 ) • Lipid Elevations : Assess lipid levels 8 - 12 weeks from start of therapy and treat as needed .
( 5 . 5 ) • Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events ( MACE ) : Monitor for development of MACE .
( 5 . 6 ) • Thrombosis : Evaluate and treat symptoms of thrombosis promptly .
( 5 . 7 ) • Secondary Malignancies : Monitor for development of secondary malignancies , particularly in patients who are current or past smokers .
( 5 . 8 ) 5 . 1 Thrombocytopenia , Anemia and Neutropenia Treatment with Jakafi can cause thrombocytopenia , anemia and neutropenia [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Manage thrombocytopenia by reducing the dose or temporarily interrupting Jakafi .
Platelet transfusions may be necessary [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Patients developing anemia may require blood transfusions and / or dose modifications of Jakafi .
Severe neutropenia ( ANC less than 0 . 5 × 109 / L ) was generally reversible by withholding Jakafi until recovery .
Perform a pre - treatment complete blood count ( CBC ) and monitor CBCs every 2 to 4 weeks until doses are stabilized , and then as clinically indicated [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
5 . 2 Risk of Infection Serious bacterial , mycobacterial , fungal and viral infections have occurred [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Delay starting therapy with Jakafi until active serious infections have resolved .
Observe patients receiving Jakafi for signs and symptoms of infection and manage promptly .
Use active surveillance and prophylactic antibiotics according to clinical guidelines .
Tuberculosis Tuberculosis infection has been reported in patients receiving Jakafi .
Observe patients receiving Jakafi for signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis and manage promptly .
Prior to initiating Jakafi , patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis risk factors , and those at higher risk should be tested for latent infection .
Risk factors include , but are not limited to , prior residence in or travel to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis , close contact with a person with active tuberculosis , and a history of active or latent tuberculosis where an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed .
For patients with evidence of active or latent tuberculosis , consult a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis before starting Jakafi .
The decision to continue Jakafi during treatment of active tuberculosis should be based on the overall risk - benefit determination .
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) has occurred with Jakafi treatment .
If PML is suspected , stop Jakafi and evaluate .
Herpes Zoster Advise patients about early signs and symptoms of herpes zoster and to seek treatment as early as possible if suspected .
Hepatitis B Hepatitis B viral load ( HBV - DNA titer ) increases , with or without associated elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase , have been reported in patients with chronic HBV infections taking Jakafi .
The effect of Jakafi on viral replication in patients with chronic HBV infection is unknown .
Patients with chronic HBV infection should be treated and monitored according to clinical guidelines .
5 . 3 Symptom Exacerbation Following Interruption or Discontinuation of Treatment with Jakafi Following discontinuation of Jakafi , symptoms from myeloproliferative neoplasms may return to pretreatment levels over a period of approximately one week .
Some patients with MF have experienced one or more of the following adverse events after discontinuing Jakafi : fever , respiratory distress , hypotension , DIC , or multi - organ failure .
If one or more of these occur after discontinuation of , or while tapering the dose of Jakafi , evaluate for and treat any intercurrent illness and consider restarting or increasing the dose of Jakafi .
Instruct patients not to interrupt or discontinue Jakafi therapy without consulting their physician .
When discontinuing or interrupting therapy with Jakafi for reasons other than thrombocytopenia or neutropenia [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) ] , consider tapering the dose of Jakafi gradually rather than discontinuing abruptly .
5 . 4 Non - Melanoma Skin Cancer ( NMSC ) Non - melanoma skin cancers including basal cell , squamous cell , and Merkel cell carcinoma have occurred in patients treated with Jakafi .
Perform periodic skin examinations .
5 . 5 Lipid Elevations Treatment with Jakafi has been associated with increases in lipid parameters including total cholesterol , low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol , and triglycerides [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The effect of these lipid parameter elevations on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined in patients treated with Jakafi .
Assess lipid parameters approximately 8 - 12 weeks following initiation of Jakafi therapy .
Monitor and treat according to clinical guidelines for the management of hyperlipidemia .
5 . 6 Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events ( MACE ) Another JAK - inhibitor has increased the risk of MACE , including cardiovascular death , myocardial infarction , and stroke ( compared to those treated with TNF blockers ) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis , a condition for which Jakafi is not indicated .
Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with Jakafi particularly in patients who are current or past smokers and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors .
Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious cardiovascular events and the steps to take if they occur .
5 . 7 Thrombosis Another JAK - inhibitor has increased the risk of thrombosis , including deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) , pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , and arterial thrombosis ( compared to those treated with TNF blockers ) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis , a condition for which Jakafi is not indicated .
In patients with MF and PV treated with Jakafi in clinical trials , the rates of thromboembolic events were similar in Jakafi and control treated patients .
Patients with symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly evaluated and treated appropriately .
5 . 8 Secondary Malignancies Another JAK - inhibitor has increased the risk of lymphoma and other malignancies excluding NMSC ( compared to those treated with TNF blockers ) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis , a condition for which Jakafi is not indicated .
Patients who are current or past smokers are at additional increased risk .
Consider the benefits and risks for the individual patient prior to initiating or continuing therapy with Jakafi , particularly in patients with a known secondary malignancy ( other than a successfully treated NMSC ) , patients who develop a malignancy , and patients who are current or past smokers .

Myelofibrosis The safety of Jakafi was assessed in 617 patients in six clinical studies with a median duration of follow - up of 10 . 9 months , including 301 patients with MF in two Phase 3 studies .
In these two Phase 3 studies , patients had a median duration of exposure to Jakafi of 9 . 5 months ( range 0 . 5 to 17 months ) , with 89 % of patients treated for more than 6 months and 25 % treated for more than 12 months .
One hundred and eleven ( 111 ) patients started treatment at 15 mg twice daily and 190 patients started at 20 mg twice daily .
In patients starting treatment with 15 mg twice daily ( pretreatment platelet counts of 100 to 200 x 109 / L ) and 20 mg twice daily ( pretreatment platelet counts greater than 200 x 109 / L ) , 65 % and 25 % of patients , respectively , required a dose reduction below the starting dose within the first 8 weeks of therapy .
In a double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled study of Jakafi , among the 155 patients treated with Jakafi , the most frequent adverse reactions were thrombocytopenia and anemia [ see Table 13 ] .
Thrombocytopenia , anemia and neutropenia are dose - related effects .
The three most frequent nonhematologic adverse reactions were bruising , dizziness and headache [ see Table 12 ] .
Discontinuation for adverse events , regardless of causality , was observed in 11 % of patients treated with Jakafi and 11 % of patients treated with placebo .

One patient ( < 1 % ) discontinued treatment because of anemia .
In patients receiving Jakafi , mean decreases in hemoglobin reached a nadir of approximately 1 . 5 to 2 . 0 g / dL below baseline after 8 to 12 weeks of therapy and then gradually recovered to reach a new steady state that was approximately 1 . 0 g / dL below baseline .
This pattern was observed in patients regardless of whether they had received transfusions during therapy .
In the randomized , placebo - controlled study , 60 % of patients treated with Jakafi and 38 % of patients receiving placebo received red blood cell transfusions during randomized treatment .
Among transfused patients , the median number of units transfused per month was 1 . 2 in patients treated with Jakafi and 1 . 7 in placebo treated patients .
Thrombocytopenia In the two Phase 3 clinical studies , in patients who developed Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia , the median time to onset was approximately 8 weeks .
Thrombocytopenia was generally reversible with dose reduction or dose interruption .
The median time to recovery of platelet counts above 50 x 109 / L was 14 days .
Platelet transfusions were administered to 5 % of patients receiving Jakafi and to 4 % of patients receiving control regimens .
Discontinuation of treatment because of thrombocytopenia occurred in < 1 % of patients receiving Jakafi and < 1 % of patients receiving control regimens .
Patients with a platelet count of 100 x 109 / L to 200 x 109 / L before starting Jakafi had a higher frequency of Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia compared to patients with a platelet count greater than 200 x 109 / L ( 17 % versus 7 % ) .
Neutropenia In the two Phase 3 clinical studies , 1 % of patients reduced or stopped Jakafi because of neutropenia .
Table 13 provides the frequency and severity of clinical hematology abnormalities reported for patients receiving treatment with Jakafi or placebo in the placebo - controlled study .

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Renal Impairment : Reduce Jakafi starting dose or avoid treatment as recommended .
( 2 . 6 , 8 . 6 ) • Hepatic Impairment : Reduce Jakafi starting dose or avoid treatment as recommended .
( 2 . 6 , 8 . 7 ) • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary When pregnant rats and rabbits were administered ruxolitinib during the period of organogenesis adverse developmental outcomes occurred at doses associated with maternal toxicity ( see Data ) .
There are no studies with the use of Jakafi in pregnant women to inform drug - associated risks .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications .
The background risk in the U . S . general population of major birth defects is 2 % to 4 % and miscarriage is 15 % to 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
Data Animal Data Ruxolitinib was administered orally to pregnant rats or rabbits during the period of organogenesis , at doses of 15 , 30 or 60 mg / kg / day in rats and 10 , 30 or 60 mg / kg / day in rabbits .
There were no treatment - related malformations .
Adverse developmental outcomes , such as decreases of approximately 9 % in fetal weights were noted in rats at the highest and maternally toxic dose of 60 mg / kg / day .
This dose results in an exposure ( AUC ) that is approximately 2 times the clinical exposure at the maximum recommended dose of 25 mg twice daily .
In rabbits , lower fetal weights of approximately 8 % and increased late resorptions were noted at the highest and maternally toxic dose of 60 mg / kg / day .
This dose is approximately 7 % the clinical exposure at the maximum recommended dose .
In a pre - and post - natal development study in rats , pregnant animals were dosed with ruxolitinib from implantation through lactation at doses up to 30 mg / kg / day .
There were no drug - related adverse findings in pups for fertility indices or for maternal or embryofetal survival , growth and development parameters at the highest dose evaluated ( 34 % the clinical exposure at the maximum recommended dose of 25 mg twice daily ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of ruxolitinib in human milk , the effects on the breast fed child , or the effects on milk production .
Ruxolitinib and / or its metabolites were present in the milk of lactating rats ( see Data ) .
Because many drugs are present in human milk and because of the potential for thrombocytopenia and anemia shown for Jakafi in human studies , discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with Jakafi and for two weeks after the final dose .
Data Animal Data Lactating rats were administered a single dose of [ 14 C ] - labeled ruxolitinib ( 30 mg / kg ) on postnatal Day 10 , after which plasma and milk samples were collected for up to 24 hours .
The AUC for total radioactivity in milk was approximately 13 - fold the maternal plasma AUC .
Additional analysis showed the presence of ruxolitinib and several of its metabolites in milk , all at levels higher than those in maternal plasma .

The safety and effectiveness of Jakafi for treatment of cGVHD has not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years old .
Other Myeloproliferative Neoplasms , Leukemias , and Solid Tumors The safety and effectiveness of ruxolitinib were assessed but not established in a single - arm trial ( NCT01164163 ) in patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors , leukemias , or myeloproliferative neoplasms .
The patients included 18 children ( age 2 to < 12 years ) and 14 adolescents ( age 12 to < 17 years ) .
Overall , 19 % of patients received more than one cycle .
No new safety signals were observed in pediatric patients in this trial .
The safety and effectiveness of ruxolitinib in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of high - risk , de novo CRLF2 rearranged or JAK pathway – mutant Ph - like acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) were assessed but not established in a single - arm trial ( NCT02723994 ) .
The patients included 2 infants ( age < 2 years ) , 42 children ( age 2 to < 12 years ) and 62 adolescents ( age 12 to < 17 years ) .
No new safety signals were observed in pediatric patients in this trial .
Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Administration of ruxolitinib to juvenile rats resulted in effects on growth and bone measures .
When administered starting at postnatal day 7 ( the equivalent of a human newborn ) at doses of 1 . 5 to 75 mg / kg / day , evidence of fractures occurred at doses ≥ 30 mg / kg / day , and effects on body weight and other bone measures [ e . g . , bone mineral content , peripheral quantitative computed tomography , and x - ray analysis ] occurred at doses ≥ 5 mg / kg / day .
When administered starting at postnatal day 21 ( the equivalent of a human 2 - 3 years of age ) at doses of 5 to 60 mg / kg / day , effects on body weight and bone occurred at doses ≥ 15 mg / kg / day , which were considered adverse at 60 mg / kg / day .
Males were more severely affected than females in all age groups , and effects were generally more severe when administration was initiated earlier in the postnatal period .
These findings were observed at exposures that are at least 27 % the clinical exposure at the maximum recommended dose of 25 mg twice daily .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients with MF in clinical studies with Jakafi , 52 % were 65 years and older , while 15 % were 75 years and older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of Jakafi were observed between these patients and younger patients .
Clinical studies of Jakafi in patients with aGVHD did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Of the total number of patients with cGVHD treated with Jakafi in clinical trials , 11 % were 65 years and older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of Jakafi were observed between these patients and younger patients .

Jakafi ( ruxolitinib ) Tablets are for oral administration .
Each tablet contains 6 . 6 mg , 13 . 2 mg , 19 . 8 mg , 26 . 4 mg , or 33 mg of ruxolitinib phosphate equivalent to 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , 20 mg , or 25 mg of ruxolitinib free base , respectively , together with microcrystalline cellulose , lactose monohydrate , magnesium stearate , colloidal silicon dioxide , sodium starch glycolate , povidone and hydroxypropyl cellulose .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Ruxolitinib , a kinase inhibitor , inhibits Janus Associated Kinases ( JAKs ) JAK1 and JAK2 which mediate the signaling of a number of cytokines and growth factors that are important for hematopoiesis and immune function .
JAK signaling involves recruitment of STATs ( signal transducers and activators of transcription ) to cytokine receptors , activation and subsequent localization of STATs to the nucleus leading to modulation of gene expression .
MF and PV are myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPN ) known to be associated with dysregulated JAK1 and JAK2 signaling .
In a mouse model of JAK2V617F - positive MPN , oral administration of ruxolitinib prevented splenomegaly , preferentially decreased JAK2V617F mutant cells in the spleen and decreased circulating inflammatory cytokines ( e . g . , TNF - α , IL - 6 ) .
JAK - STAT signaling pathways play a role in regulating the development , proliferation , and activation of several immune cell types important for GVHD pathogenesis .
In a mouse model of aGVHD , oral administration of ruxolitinib was associated with decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines in colon homogenates and reduced immune - cell infiltration in the colon .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Jakafi inhibits cytokine induced STAT3 phosphorylation in whole blood from patients with MF and PV .
STAT3 phosphorylation reached maximal inhibition 2 hours after Jakafi dosing and returned to near baseline by 10 hours in patients with MF and PV .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose of 1 . 25 to 10 times the highest recommended starting dosage , Jakafi does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Mean ruxolitinib maximal plasma concentration ( Cmax ) and AUC increased proportionally over a single dose range of 5 mg to 200 mg ( 4 times the approved highest recommended total daily dosage of 25 mg twice daily ) .
Mean ruxolitinib Cmax ranged from 205 nM to 7100 nM and AUC ranged from 862 nM * hr to 30700 nM * hr over a single dose range of 5 mg to 200 mg .
Absorption Ruxolitinib achieves Cmax within 1 hour to 2 hours post - dose .
Oral absorption of ruxolitinib is estimated to be at least 95 % .
Effect of Food No clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of ruxolitinib were observed upon administration of Jakafi with a high - fat , high - calorie meal ( approximately 800 to 1000 calories of which 50 % were derived from fat ) .
Distribution The mean ruxolitinib volume of distribution at steady - state is 72 L ( coefficient of variation [ CV ] 29 % ) in patients with MF and 75 L ( 23 % ) in patients with PV .
Protein binding of ruxolitinib is approximately 97 % , mostly to albumin .
Elimination The mean elimination half - life of ruxolitinib is approximately 3 hours and the mean elimination half - life of ruxolitinib and its metabolites is approximately 5 . 8 hours in healthy volunteers .
Ruxolitinib clearance ( % CV ) was 17 . 7 L / h in women and 22 . 1 L / h in men with MF ( 39 % ) .
Ruxolitinib clearance ( % CV ) was 12 . 7 L / h ( 42 % ) in patients with PV .
Ruxolitinib clearance ( % CV ) was 11 . 8 L / h ( 63 % ) in patients with aGVHD .
Ruxolitinib clearance ( % CV ) was 9 . 7 L / h ( 51 % ) in patients with cGVHD .
Metabolism Ruxolitinib is metabolized by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 .
Excretion Following a single oral dose of radiolabeled ruxolitinib , 74 % of radioactivity was excreted in urine and 22 % via feces .
Unchanged drug accounted for less than 1 % of the excreted total radioactivity .
Specific Populations No clinically relevant differences in ruxolitinib pharmacokinetics were observed based on age ( 12 - 73 years ) , race ( White , Asian ) , sex , or weight ( 29 - 139 kg ) .
Patients with Renal Impairment Total AUC of ruxolitinib and its active metabolites increased by 1 . 3 - , 1 . 5 - , 1 . 9 - , and 1 . 6 - fold in subjects with mild , moderate , severe renal impairment , and with ESRD after dialysis , respectively , compared to subjects with normal renal function ( CLcr ≥ 90 mL / min ) .
The change in the pharmacodynamic marker , pSTAT3 inhibition , was consistent with the corresponding increase in metabolite exposure with renal impairment .
Ruxolitinib is not removed by dialysis ; however , the removal of some active metabolites by dialysis cannot be ruled out .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinically relevant effect on ruxolitinib pharmacokinetics was observed based on mild to severe hepatic impairment by NCI criteria ( total bilirubin > ULN and any AST ) in patients with aGVHD or cGVHD .

NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Ruxolitinib was not carcinogenic in the 6 - month Tg . rasH2 transgenic mouse model or in a 2 - year carcinogenicity study in the rat .
Ruxolitinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenicity assay ( Ames test ) or clastogenic in in vitro chromosomal aberration assay ( cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes ) or in vivo in a rat bone marrow micronucleus assay .
In a fertility study , ruxolitinib was administered to male rats prior to and throughout mating and to female rats prior to mating and up to the implantation day ( gestation day 7 ) .
Ruxolitinib had no effect on fertility or reproductive function in male or female rats at doses of 10 , 30 or 60 mg / kg / day .
However , in female rats doses of greater than or equal to 30 mg / kg / day resulted in increased post - implantation loss .
The exposure ( AUC ) at the dose of 30 mg / kg / day is approximately 34 % the clinical exposure at the maximum recommended dose of 25 mg twice daily .

CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Myelofibrosis Two randomized Phase 3 studies ( Studies 1 and 2 ) were conducted in patients with MF ( either primary MF , post - polycythemia vera MF or post - essential thrombocythemia - MF ) .
In both studies , patients had palpable splenomegaly at least 5 cm below the costal margin and risk category of intermediate 2 ( 2 prognostic factors ) or high risk ( 3 or more prognostic factors ) based on the International Working Group Consensus Criteria ( IWG ) .
The starting dose of Jakafi was based on platelet count .
Patients with a platelet count between 100 and 200 x 109 / L were started on Jakafi 15 mg twice daily and patients with a platelet count greater than 200 x 109 / L were started on Jakafi 20 mg twice daily .
Doses were then individualized based upon tolerability and efficacy with maximum doses of 20 mg twice daily for patients with platelet counts between 100 to less than or equal to 125 x 109 / L , of 10 mg twice daily for patients with platelet counts between 75 to less than or equal to 100 x 109 / L , and of 5 mg twice daily for patients with platelet counts between 50 to less than or equal to 75 x 109 / L .
Study 1 Study 1 ( NCT00952289 ) was a double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled study in 309 patients who were refractory to or were not candidates for available therapy .
The median age was 68 years ( range 40 to 91 years ) with 61 % of patients older than 65 years and 54 % were male .
Fifty percent ( 50 % ) of patients had primary MF , 31 % had post - polycythemia vera MF and 18 % had post - essential thrombocythemia MF .
Twenty - one percent ( 21 % ) of patients had red blood cell transfusions within 8 weeks of enrollment in the study .
The median hemoglobin count was 10 . 5 g / dL and the median platelet count was 251 x 109 / L .
Patients had a median palpable spleen length of 16 cm below the costal margin , with 81 % having a spleen length 10 cm or greater below the costal margin .
Patients had a median spleen volume as measured by magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) or computed tomography ( CT ) of 2595 cm3 ( range 478 cm3 to 8881 cm3 ) .
( The upper limit of normal is approximately 300 cm3 ) .
Patients were dosed with Jakafi or matching placebo .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving greater than or equal to a 35 % reduction from baseline in spleen volume at Week 24 as measured by MRI or CT .
Secondary endpoints included duration of a 35 % or greater reduction in spleen volume and proportion of patients with a 50 % or greater reduction in Total Symptom Score from baseline to Week 24 as measured by the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form ( MFSAF ) v2 . 0 diary .
Study 2 Study 2 ( NCT00934544 ) was an open - label , randomized study in 219 patients .
Patients were randomized 2 : 1 to Jakafi versus best available therapy .
Best available therapy was selected by the investigator on a patient - by - patient basis .
In the best available therapy arm , the medications received by more than 10 % of patients were hydroxyurea ( 47 % ) and glucocorticoids ( 16 % ) .
The median age was 66 years ( range 35 to 85 years ) with 52 % of patients older than 65 years and 57 % were male .
Fifty - three percent ( 53 % ) of patients had primary MF , 31 % had post - polycythemia vera MF and 16 % had post - essential thrombocythemia MF .
Twenty - one percent ( 21 % ) of patients had red blood cell transfusions within 8 weeks of enrollment in the study .
The median hemoglobin count was 10 . 4 g / dL and the median platelet count was 236 x 109 / L .
Patients had a median palpable spleen length of 15 cm below the costal margin , with 70 % having a spleen length 10 cm or greater below the costal margin .
Patients had a median spleen volume as measured by MRI or CT of 2381 cm3 ( range 451 cm3 to 7765 cm3 ) .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving 35 % or greater reduction from baseline in spleen volume at Week 48 as measured by MRI or CT .
A secondary endpoint in Study 2 was the proportion of patients achieving a 35 % or greater reduction of spleen volume as measured by MRI or CT from baseline to Week 24 .
Study 1 and 2 Efficacy Results Efficacy analyses of the primary endpoint in Studies 1 and 2 are presented in Table 20 below .
A significantly larger proportion of patients in the Jakafi group achieved a 35 % or greater reduction in spleen volume from baseline in both studies compared to placebo in Study 1 and best available therapy in Study 2 .
A similar proportion of patients in the Jakafi group achieved a 50 % or greater reduction in palpable spleen length .

One ( 1 ) patient ( placebo ) with a missing baseline spleen volume is not included .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] In Study 1 , MF symptoms were a secondary endpoint and were measured using the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form ( MFSAF ) v2 . 0 diary .
The modified MFSAF is a daily diary capturing the core symptoms of MF ( abdominal discomfort , pain under left ribs , night sweats , itching , bone / muscle pain and early satiety ) .
Symptom scores ranged from 0 to 10 with 0 representing symptoms " absent " and 10 representing " worst imaginable " symptoms .
These scores were added to create the daily total score , which has a maximum of 60 .
Table 21 presents assessments of Total Symptom Score from baseline to Week 24 in Study 1 including the proportion of patients with at least a 50 % reduction ( ie , improvement in symptoms ) .
At baseline , the mean Total Symptom Score was 18 . 0 in the Jakafi group and 16 . 5 in the placebo group .
A higher proportion of patients in the Jakafi group had a 50 % or greater reduction in Total Symptom Score than in the placebo group , with a median time to response of less than 4 weeks .

Results are excluded for 5 patients with a baseline Total Symptom Score of zero , 8 patients with missing baseline and 6 patients with insufficient post - baseline data .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 3 displays the proportion of patients with at least a 50 % improvement in each of the individual symptoms that comprise the Total Symptom Score indicating that all 6 of the symptoms contributed to the higher Total Symptom Score response rate in the group treated with Jakafi .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] An exploratory analysis of patients receiving Jakafi also showed improvement in fatigue - related symptoms ( i . e . , tiredness , exhaustion , mental tiredness , and lack of energy ) and associated impacts on daily activities ( i . e . , activity limitations related to work , self - care , and exercise ) as measured by the PROMIS ® Fatigue 7 - item short form total score at Week 24 .
Patients who achieved a reduction of 4 . 5 points or more from baseline to Week 24 in the PROMIS ® Fatigue total score were considered to have achieved a fatigue response .
Fatigue response was reported in 35 % of patients in the Jakafi group versus 14 % of the patients in the placebo group .
Overall survival was a secondary endpoint in both Study 1 and Study 2 .
Patients in the control groups were eligible for crossover in both studies , and the median times to crossover were 9 months in Study 1 and 17 months in Study 2 .
Figure 4 and Figure 5 show Kaplan - Meier curves of overall survival at prospectively planned analyses after all patients remaining on study had completed 144 weeks on study .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Polycythemia Vera Study 3 ( NCT01243944 ) was a randomized , open - label , active - controlled Phase 3 study conducted in 222 patients with PV .
Patients had been diagnosed with PV for at least 24 weeks , had an inadequate response to or were intolerant of hydroxyurea , required phlebotomy and exhibited splenomegaly .
All patients were required to demonstrate hematocrit control between 40 - 45 % prior to randomization .
The age ranged from 33 to 90 years with 30 % of patients over 65 years of age and 66 % were male .
Patients had a median spleen volume as measured by MRI or CT of 1272 cm3 ( range 254 cm3 to 5147 cm3 ) and median palpable spleen length below the costal margin was 7 cm .
Patients were randomized to Jakafi or best available therapy .
The starting dose of Jakafi was 10 mg twice daily .
Doses were then individualized based upon tolerability and efficacy with a maximum dose of 25 mg twice daily .
At Week 32 , 98 patients were still on Jakafi with 8 % receiving greater than 20 mg twice daily , 15 % receiving 20 mg twice daily , 33 % receiving 15 mg twice daily , 34 % receiving 10 mg twice daily , and 10 % receiving less than 10 mg twice daily .
Best available therapy ( BAT ) was selected by the investigator on a patient - by - patient basis and included hydroxyurea ( 60 % ) , interferon / pegylated interferon ( 12 % ) , anagrelide ( 7 % ) , pipobroman ( 2 % ) , lenalidomide / thalidomide ( 5 % ) , and observation ( 15 % ) .
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving a response at Week 32 , with response defined as having achieved both hematocrit control ( the absence of phlebotomy eligibility beginning at the Week 8 visit and continuing through Week 32 ) and spleen volume reduction ( a greater than or equal to 35 % reduction from baseline in spleen volume at Week 32 ) .
Phlebotomy eligibility was defined as a confirmed hematocrit greater than 45 % that is at least 3 percentage points higher than the hematocrit obtained at baseline or a confirmed hematocrit greater than 48 % , whichever was lower .
Secondary endpoints included the proportion of all randomized subjects who achieved the primary endpoint and who maintained their response 48 weeks after randomization , and the proportion of subjects achieving complete hematological remission at Week 32 with complete hematological remission defined as achieving hematocrit control , platelet count less than or equal to 400 x 109 / L , and white blood cell count less than or equal to 10 x 109 / L .
Results of the primary and secondary endpoints are presented in Table 22 .
A significantly larger proportion of patients on the Jakafi arm achieved a response for the primary endpoint compared to best available therapy at Week 32 and maintained their response 48 weeks after randomization .
A significantly larger proportion of patients on the Jakafi arm compared to best available therapy also achieved complete hematological remission at Week 32 .

On this arm , 91 ( 83 % ) patients were still on treatment at the time of the Week 80 data cut - off .
Of the 25 patients who achieved a primary response at Week 32 , 19 ( 76 % of the responders ) maintained their response through Week 80 , and of the 26 patients who achieved complete hematological remission at Week 32 , 15 ( 58 % of the responders ) maintained their response through Week 80 .
In an assessment of the individual components that make up the primary endpoint , there were 66 ( 60 % ) patients with hematocrit control on the Jakafi arm vs . 21 ( 19 % ) patients on best available therapy at Week 32 ; 51 ( 77 % of hematocrit responders ) patients on the Jakafi arm maintained hematocrit control through Week 80 .
There were 44 ( 40 % ) patients with spleen volume reduction from baseline greater than or equal to 35 % on the Jakafi arm vs . 1 ( < 1 % ) patient on best available therapy at Week 32 ; 43 ( 98 % of spleen volume reduction responders ) patients on the Jakafi arm maintained spleen volume reduction through Week 80 .
14 . 3 Acute Graft - Versus - Host Disease Study 4 ( NCT02953678 ) was an open - label , single - arm , multicenter study of Jakafi for treatment of patients with steroid - refractory aGVHD Grades 2 to 4 ( Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium ( MAGIC ) criteria ) occurring after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation .
Jakafi was administered at 5 mg twice daily , and the dose could be increased to 10 mg twice daily after 3 days in the absence of toxicity .
There were 49 patients with aGVHD refractory to steroids alone .
These patients had a median age of 57 years ( range , 18 - 72 years ) , 47 % were male , 92 % were Caucasian , and 14 % were Hispanic .
At baseline , aGVHD was Grade 2 in 27 % , Grade 3 in 55 % , and Grade 4 in 18 % ; 84 % had visceral GVHD ; the median MAGIC biomarker score was 0 . 47 ( range , 0 . 10 ‑ 0 . 92 ) ; and the median ST2 level was 334 mcg / L ( range , 55 - 1286 mcg / L ) .
The median duration of prior corticosteroid exposure at baseline was 15 days ( range : 3 - 106 days ) .
The efficacy of Jakafi was based on Day - 28 overall response rate ( ORR ) ( complete response , very good partial response or partial response by Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research ( CIBMTR ) criteria ) and the duration of response .
The ORR results are presented in Table 23 ; Day - 28 ORR was 100 % for Grade 2 GVHD , 40 . 7 % for Grade 3 GVHD , and 44 . 4 % for Grade 4 GVHD .
The median duration of response , calculated from Day - 28 response to progression , new salvage therapy for aGVHD or death from any cause ( with progression being defined as worsening by one stage in any organ without improvement in other organs in comparison to prior response assessment ) was 16 days ( 95 % CI 9 , 83 ) .
Also , for the Day - 28 responders , the median time from Day - 28 response to either death or need for new therapy for aGVHD ( additional salvage therapy or increase in steroids ) was 173 days ( 95 % CI 66 , NE ) .

Eligible patients were ≥ 12 years old with moderate or severe cGVHD as defined by NIH Consensus Criteria requiring additional therapy after failure of corticosteroid therapy and no more than one additional salvage treatment .
Patients were excluded if they had ANC < 1 Gi / L and platelet count < 25 Gi / L , estimated creatinine clearance < 30 ml / min , progressive onset cGVHD , oxygen saturation < 90 % , total bilirubin > 2 mg / dL , or diarrhea due to GVHD .
A total of 329 patients were randomized 1 : 1 to receive either Jakafi 10 mg twice daily ( n = 165 ) or BAT ( n = 164 ) .
BAT was selected by the investigator prior to randomization and included the following treatments : extracorporeal photopheresis ( ECP ) , low - dose methotrexate ( MTX ) , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , mTOR inhibitors ( everolimus or sirolimus ) , infliximab , rituximab , pentostatin , imatinib , or ibrutinib .
Randomization was stratified by cGVHD severity ( moderate versus severe ) .
On Cycle 7 Day 1 and thereafter , patients randomized to BAT could cross over to Jakafi if they had disease progression , mixed response , unchanged response , cGVHD flare , or toxicity to BAT .
All patients also received standard supportive care , including anti - infective medications .
GVHD prophylaxis and cGVHD treatment medications initiated before randomization , including systemic corticosteroids , calcineurin inhibitors , and topical or inhaled corticosteroid therapy , were allowed to be continued per institutional guidelines .
Table 24 shows the demographics and baseline disease characteristics of the randomized population .
