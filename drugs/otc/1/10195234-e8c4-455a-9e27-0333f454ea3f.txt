Since corticosteroids may inhibit the body ’ s defense mechanism against infection , concomitant antimicrobial drugs may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant in a particular case .
When a decision to administer both a corticosteroid and antimicrobials is made , the administration of such drugs in combination has the advantage of greater patient compliance and convenience , with the added assurance that the appropriate dosage of all drugs is administered .
When each type of drug is in the same formulation , compatibility of ingredients is assured and the correct volume of drug is delivered and retained .
The relative potency of corticosteroids depends on the molecular structure , concentration and release from the vehicle .

CONTRAINDICATIONS : Neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates , bacitracin zinc and hydrocortisone ophthalmic ointment is contraindicated in most viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including : epithelial herpes simplex keratitis ( dendritic keratitis ) , vaccinia and varicella , and also in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal diseases of ocular structures .
This product is also contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its components .
Hypersensitivity to the antibiotic component occurs at a higher rate than for other components .
WARNINGS : NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE .
Neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates , bacitracin zinc and hydrocortisone ophthalmic ointment should never be directly introduced into the anterior chamber of the eye .
Ophthalmic ointments may retard corneal wound healing .
Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in ocular hypertension and / or glaucoma , with damage to the optic nerve , defects in visual acuity and fields of vision , and in posterior subcapsular cataract formation .
Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections .
In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera , perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical corticosteroids .
In acute purulent conditions of the eye , corticosteroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection .
If these products are used for 10 days or longer , intraocular pressure should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in uncooperative patients .
Corticosteroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma .
The use of corticosteroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of filtering blebs .
Use of ocular corticosteroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye ( including herpes simplex ) .
Employment of corticosteroid medication in the treatment of herpes simplex requires great caution .
Topical antibiotics , particularly neomycin sulfate , may cause cutaneous sensitization .
A precise incidence of hypersensitivity reactions ( primarily skin rash ) due to topical antibiotics is not known .
The manifestations of sensitization to topical antibiotics are usually itching , reddening , and edema of the conjunctiva and eyelid .
A sensitization reaction may manifest simply as a failure to heal .
During long - term use of topical antibiotic products , periodic examination for such signs is advisable , and the patient should be told to discontinue the product if they are observed .
Symptoms usually subside quickly on withdrawing the medication .
Applications of products containing these ingredients should be avoided for the patient thereafter ( see PRECAUTIONS : General ) .
PRECAUTIONS : General : The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 8 grams should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification , such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and , where appropriate , fluorescein staining .
If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days , the patient should be re - evaluated .
The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after prolonged corticosteroid dosing .
Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate .
If this product is used for 10 days or longer , intraocular pressure should be monitored ( see WARNINGS ) .
There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of topical ophthalmic products in multiple - dose containers which have been inadvertently contaminated by patients , most of whom had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface ( see PRECAUTIONS : Information for Patients ) .
Allergic cross - reactions may occur which could prevent the use of any or all of the following antibiotics for the treatment of future infections : kanamycin , paromomycin , streptomycin , and possibly gentamicin .
Information for Patients : Patients should be instructed to avoid allowing the tip of the dispensing container to contact the eye , eyelid , fingers , or any other surface .
The use of this product by more than one person may spread infection .
Patients should also be instructed that ocular products , if handled improperly , can become contaminated by common bacteria known to cause ocular infections .
Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated products ( see PRECAUTIONS : General ) .
If the condition persists or gets worse , or if a rash or allergic reaction develops , the patient should be advised to stop use and consult a physician .
Do not use this product if you are allergic to any of the listed ingredients .
Keep tightly closed when not in use .
Keep out of the reach of children .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Long - term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential have not been conducted with polymyxin B sulfate or bacitracin .
Treatment of cultured human lymphocytes in vitro with neomycin increased the frequency of chromosome aberrations at the highest concentration ( 80 mcg / mL ) tested ; however , the effects of neomycin on carcinogenesis and mutagenesis in humans are unknown .
Long - term studies in animals ( rats , rabbits , mice ) showed no evidence of carcinogenicity or mutagenicity attributable to oral administration of corticosteroids .
Long - term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of topical corticosteroids .
Studies to determine mutagenicity with hydrocortisone have revealed negative results .
Polymyxin B has been reported to impair the motility of equine sperm , but its effects on male or female fertility are unknown .
No adverse effects on male or female fertility , litter size or survival were observed in rabbits given bacitracin zinc 100 gm / ton of diet .
Long - term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the effect on fertility of topical corticosteroids .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category C . Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in rabbits when applied topically at concentrations of 0 . 5 % on days 6 to 18 of gestation and in mice when applied topically at a concentration of 15 % on days 10 to 13 of gestation .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates , bacitracin zinc and hydrocortisone ophthalmic ointment should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Nursing Mothers : It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk .
Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth , interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production , or cause other untoward effects .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from neomycin and polymyxin B sulfates , bacitracin zinc and hydrocortisone ophthalmic ointment , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
Pediatric Use : Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
ADVERSE REACTIONS : Adverse reactions have occurred with corticosteroid / anti - infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the corticosteroid component , the anti - infective component , or the combination .
The exact incidence is not known .
Reactions occurring most often from the presence of the anti - infective ingredient are allergic sensitization reactions including itching , swelling and conjunctival erythema ( see WARNINGS ) .
More serious hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis , have been reported rarely .
The reactions due to the corticosteroid component in decreasing order of frequency are : elevation of intraocular pressure ( IOP ) with possible development of glaucoma , and infrequent optic nerve damage ; posterior subcapsular cataract formation ; and delayed wound healing .
Secondary Infection : The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing corticosteroids and antimicrobials .
Fungal and viral infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long - term applications of a corticosteroid .
The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where corticosteroid treatment has been used .
Local irritation on instillation has also been reported .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : Apply the ointment in the affected eye every 3 or 4 hours , depending on the severity of the condition .
Not more than 8 grams should be prescribed initially and the prescription should not be refilled without further evaluation as outlined in PRECAUTIONS : above .
