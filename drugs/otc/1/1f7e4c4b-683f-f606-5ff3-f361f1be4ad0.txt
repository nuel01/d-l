( 5 . 12 ) 5 . 1 Cardiovascular Events In the SHARP ( HCC ) study , the incidence of cardiac ischemia / infarction was 2 . 7 % in sorafenib - treated patients compared with 1 . 3 % in those receiving placebo ; in another study , the incidence of cardiac ischemia / infarction was higher in the sorafenib - treated group ( 2 . 9 % ) compared with patients receiving placebo ( 0 . 4 % ) , and in the DECISION ( DTC ) study , the incidence of cardiac ischemia / infarction was 1 . 9 % in the sorafenib - treated group compared with 0 % in patients receiving placebo .
Patients with unstable coronary artery disease or recent myocardial infarction were excluded from this study .
In multiple clinical trials , congestive heart failure has been reported in 1 . 9 % of sorafenib - treated patients ( N = 2276 ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Consider temporary or permanent discontinuation of sorafenib tablets in patients who develop cardiovascular events [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 2 Hemorrhage An increased risk of bleeding may occur following sorafenib tablets administration .
In the SHARP ( HCC ) study , the rates of bleeding from esophageal varices ( 2 . 4 % and 4 % ) and of bleeding with a fatal outcome from any site ( 2 . 4 % and 4 % ) were similar in sorafenib - treated patients and those receiving placebo , respectively .
In another study , bleeding was reported in 15 . 3 % of patients in the sorafenib - treated group and 8 . 2 % of patients receiving placebo .
The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 bleeding was 2 % and 0 % , respectively , in sorafenib - treated patients , and 1 . 3 % and 0 . 2 % , respectively , in those receiving placebo .
There was one fatal hemorrhage in each treatment group in this study .
In the DECISION ( DTC ) study , bleeding was reported in 17 . 4 % of sorafenib - treated patients and 9 . 6 % of those receiving placebo ; however , the incidence of Grade 3 bleeding was similar ( 1 % and 1 . 4 % ) in sorafenib - treated patients and in those receiving placebo .
If any bleeding necessitates medical intervention , consider permanent discontinuation of sorafenib tablets [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Due to the potential risk of bleeding , treat tracheal , bronchial , and esophageal infiltration with local therapy prior to administering sorafenib tablets in patients with DTC .
5 . 3 Hypertension In the SHARP ( HCC ) study , hypertension was reported in 9 . 4 % of sorafenib - treated patients and 4 . 3 % of patients receiving placebo .
In another study , hypertension was reported in 16 . 9 % of sorafenib - treated patients and 1 . 8 % of patients receiving placebo .
In the DECISION ( DTC ) study , hypertension was reported in 40 . 6 % of sorafenib - treated patients and 12 . 4 % of patients receiving placebo .
Hypertension was usually mild to moderate , occurred early in the course of treatment , and was managed with standard antihypertensive therapy .
Permanent discontinuation due to hypertension occurred in 1 of 297 sorafenib - treated patients in the SHARP ( HCC ) study , 1 of 451 sorafenib - treated patients in the other study and 1 of 207 sorafenib - treated patients in the DECISION ( DTC ) study .
Monitor blood pressure weekly during the first 6 weeks of sorafenib tablets .
Thereafter , monitor blood pressure and treat hypertension , if required , in accordance with standard medical practice .
In cases of severe or persistent hypertension despite institution of antihypertensive therapy , consider temporary or permanent discontinuation of sorafenib tablets [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 4 Dermatologic Toxicities Hand - foot skin reaction and rash represent the most common adverse reactions attributed to sorafenib tablets .
Rash and hand - foot skin reaction are usually Grade 1 and 2 and generally appear during the first six weeks of treatment with sorafenib tablets .
Permanent discontinuation of therapy due to hand - foot skin reaction occurred in 4 ( 1 . 3 % ) of 297 sorafenib - treated patients with HCC , 3 ( 0 . 7 % ) of 451 sorafenib - treated patients in the other study and 11 ( 5 . 3 % ) of 207 sorafenib - treated patients with DTC .
Management of dermatologic toxicities may include topical therapies for symptomatic relief , temporary treatment interruption and / or dose reduction of sorafenib tablets , or in severe or persistent cases , permanent discontinuation of sorafenib tablets [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
There have been reports of severe dermatologic toxicities , including Stevens - Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) .
These cases may be life - threatening .
Discontinue sorafenib tablets if SJS or TEN are suspected .
5 . 5 Gastrointestinal Perforation Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported in less than 1 % of patients taking sorafenib tablets .
In some cases this was not associated with apparent intra - abdominal tumor .
In the event of a gastrointestinal perforation , permanently discontinue sorafenib tablets .
5 . 6 Increased Risk of Bleeding with Concomitant Use of Warfarin Infrequent bleeding or elevations in the International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) have been reported in some patients taking warfarin while on sorafenib tablets .
Monitor patients taking concomitant warfarin regularly for changes in prothrombin time ( PT ) , INR or clinical bleeding episodes .
5 . 7 Risk of Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the VEGF signaling pathway .
Therefore , sorafenib tablets has the potential to adversely affect wound healing .
Withhold sorafenib tablets for at least 10 days prior to elective surgery .
Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing .
The safety of resumption of sorafenib tablets after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established .
5 . 8 Increased Mortality Observed with Sorafenib Administered in Combination with Carboplatin / Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine / Cisplatin in Squamous Cell Lung Cancer In a subset analysis of two randomized controlled trials in chemo - naive patients with Stage IIIB to IV non - small cell lung cancer , patients with squamous cell carcinoma experienced higher mortality with the addition of sorafenib compared to those treated with carboplatin / paclitaxel alone ( HR 1 . 81 ; 95 % CI 1 . 19 , 2 . 74 ) and gemcitabine / cisplatin alone ( HR 1 . 22 ; 95 % CI 0 . 82 , 1 . 80 ) .
The use of sorafenib tablets in combination with carboplatin / paclitaxel is contraindicated in patients with squamous cell lung cancer .
Sorafenib tablets in combination with gemcitabine / cisplatin is not recommended in patients with squamous cell lung cancer .
The safety and effectiveness of sorafenib has not been established in patients with non - small cell lung cancer .
5 . 9 QT Interval Prolongation Sorafenib can prolong the QT / QTc interval .
QT / QTc interval prolongation increases the risk for ventricular arrhythmias .
Avoid sorafenib tablets in patients with congenital long QT syndrome .
Monitor electrolytes and electrocardiograms in patients with congestive heart failure , bradyarrhythmias , drugs known to prolong the QT interval , including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics .
Correct electrolyte abnormalities ( magnesium , potassium , calcium ) .
Interrupt sorafenib tablets if QTc interval is greater than 500 milliseconds or for an increase from baseline of 60 milliseconds or greater [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 10 Drug - Induced Liver Injury Sorafenib - induced hepatitis is characterized by a hepatocellular pattern of liver damage with significant increases of transaminases which may result in hepatic failure and death .
Increases in bilirubin and INR may also occur .
The incidence of severe drug - induced liver injury , defined as elevated transaminase levels above 20 times the upper limit of normal or transaminase elevations with significant clinical sequelae ( for example , elevated INR , ascites , fatal , or transplantation ) , was two of 3 , 357 patients ( 0 . 06 % ) in a global monotherapy database .
Monitor liver function tests regularly .
In case of significantly increased transaminases without alternative explanation , such as viral hepatitis or progressing underlying malignancy , discontinue sorafenib tablets [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 11 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals , sorafenib may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Sorafenib caused embryo - fetal toxicities in animals at maternal exposures that were significantly lower than the human exposures at the recommended dose of 400 mg twice daily .
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose of sorafenib tablets .
Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential and pregnant partners to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of sorafenib tablets [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 12 Impairment of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone Suppression in Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma Sorafenib impairs exogenous thyroid suppression .
In the DECISION ( DTC ) study , 99 % of patients had a baseline thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) level less than 0 . 5 mU / L .
Elevation of TSH level above 0 . 5 mU / L was observed in 41 % of sorafenib - treated patients as compared with 16 % of those receiving placebo patients .
For patients with impaired TSH suppression while receiving sorafenib tablets , the median maximal TSH was 1 . 6 mU / L and 25 % had TSH levels greater than 4 . 4 mU / L .
Monitor TSH levels monthly and adjust thyroid replacement medication as needed in patients with DTC .

Additional Data from Multiple Clinical Trials The following additional drug - related adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities were reported from clinical trials of sorafenib ( very common 10 % or greater , common 1 to less than 10 % , uncommon 0 . 1 % to less than 1 % , rare less than 0 . 1 % ) : Cardiovascular : Common : congestive heart failure * † , myocardial ischemia and / or infarction Uncommon : hypertensive crisis * Rare : QT prolongation * Dermatologic : Very common : erythema Common : exfoliative dermatitis , acne , flushing , folliculitis , hyperkeratosis Uncommon : eczema , erythema multiforme Digestive : Very common : increased lipase , increased amylase Common : mucositis , stomatitis ( including dry mouth and glossodynia ) , dyspepsia , dysphagia , gastrointestinal reflux Uncommon : pancreatitis , gastritis , gastrointestinal perforations * , cholecystitis , cholangitis Note that elevations in lipase are very common ( 41 % , see below ) ; a diagnosis of pancreatitis should not be made solely on the basis of abnormal laboratory values General Disorders : Very common : infection , hemorrhage ( including gastrointestinal * and respiratory tract * and uncommon cases of cerebral hemorrhage * ) , asthenia , pain ( including mouth , bone , and tumor pain ) , pyrexia , decreased appetite Common : influenza - like illness Hematologic : Very common : leukopenia , lymphopenia Common : anemia , neutropenia , thrombocytopenia Uncommon : INR abnormal Hepatobiliary disorders : Rare : drug - induced liver injury ( including hepatic failure and death ) Hypersensitivity : Uncommon : hypersensitivity reactions ( including skin reactions and urticaria ) , anaphylactic reaction Metabolic and Nutritional : Very common : hypophosphatemia Common : transient increases in transaminases , hypocalcemia , hypokalemia , hyponatremia , hypothyroidism Uncommon : dehydration , transient increases in alkaline phosphatase , increased bilirubin ( including jaundice ) , hyperthyroidism Musculoskeletal : Very common : arthralgia Common : myalgia , muscle spasms Nervous System and Psychiatric : Common : depression , dysgeusia Uncommon : tinnitus , reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy * Renal and Genitourinary : Common : renal failure , proteinuria Rare : nephrotic syndrome Reproductive : Common : erectile dysfunction Uncommon : gynecomastia Respiratory : Common : rhinorrhea Uncommon : interstitial lung disease - like events ( includes reports of pneumonitis , radiation pneumonitis , acute respiratory distress , interstitial pneumonia , pulmonitis and lung inflammation ) In addition , the following medically significant adverse reactions were uncommon during clinical trials of sorafenib : transient ischemic attack , arrhythmia , and thromboembolism .
For these adverse reactions , the causal relationship to sorafenib has not been established .
* adverse reactions may have a life - threatening or fatal outcome .
† reported in 1 . 9 % of patients treated with sorafenib ( N = 2276 ) .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sorafenib .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Blood and lymphatic disorders : Thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) Dermatologic : Stevens - Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) Hypersensitivity : Angioedema Musculoskeletal : Rhabdomyolysis , osteonecrosis of the jaw Respiratory : Interstitial lung disease - like events ( which may have a life - threatening or fatal outcome ) Vascular : Arterial ( including aortic ) aneurysms , dissections , and rupture 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Strong CYP3A Inducers : Avoid strong CYP3A4 inducers .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Effect of Other Drugs on Sorafenib Strong CYP3A4 Inducers The concomitant use of sorafenib with rifampin , a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreased the mean AUC of sorafenib , which may decrease the antitumor activity [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Avoid concomitant use of sorafenib with strong CYP3A4 inducers , when possible , because these drugs can decrease the systemic exposure to sorafenib .
Neomycin The concomitant use of sorafenib with neomycin decreased the mean AUC of sorafenib , which may decrease the antitumor activity .
Avoid concomitant use of sorafenib with neomycin .
The effects of other antibiotics on the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib have not been studied [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Concomitant Use of Warfarin The concomitant use of sorafenib and warfarin may increase the risk of bleeding or increased the INR .

7 . 3 Drugs That Prolong the QT Interval Sorafenib is associated with QTc interval prolongation .
Avoid coadministration of sorafenib tablets with medicinal products with a known potential to prolong QT / QTc interval [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise women not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] , sorafenib may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no available data in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk .
In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of sorafenib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo - fetal toxicities at maternal exposures that were significantly lower than human exposures at the recommended dose of 400 mg twice daily ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In animal reproduction studies , sorafenib was teratogenic and induced embryo - fetal toxicity ( including increased post - implantation loss , resorptions , skeletal retardations , and retarded fetal weight ) when administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis .
The effects occurred at doses considerably below the recommended human dose of 400 mg twice daily ( approximately 500 mg / m2 / day on a body surface area basis ) .
Adverse intrauterine development effects were seen at doses > 0 . 2 mg / kg / day ( 1 . 2 mg / m2 / day ) in rats and ≥ 0 . 3 mg / kg / day ( ≥ 3 . 6 mg / m2 / day ) in rabbits .
These doses result in exposures ( AUC ) that are approximately 0 . 008 times the AUC in patients at the recommended dose .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of sorafenib or its metabolites in human milk , or its effects on the breast - fed child or on milk production .
Sorafenib was present in milk of lactating rats ( see Data ) .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from sorafenib , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with sorafenib tablets and for 2 weeks after the last dose .
Data Animal Data Following administration of radiolabeled sorafenib to lactating Wistar rats , approximately 27 % of the radioactivity was secreted into milk .
The milk to plasma AUC ratio was approximately 5 : 1 .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Sorafenib may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of sorafenib .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose of sorafenib tablets .
Males Based on genotoxicity and findings in animal reproduction studies , advise males with female partners of reproductive potential and pregnant partners to use effective contraception during treatment with sorafenib tablets and for 3 months following the last dose of sorafenib tablets [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Males Based on findings in animal studies , sorafenib may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of sorafenib have not been established in pediatric patients .
Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Repeat dosing of sorafenib to young and growing dogs resulted in irregular thickening of the femoral growth plate at daily sorafenib doses ≥ 600 mg / m2 ( approximately 0 . 3 times the AUC at the recommended human dose ) , hypocellularity of the bone marrow adjoining the growth plate at 200 mg / m2 / day ( approximately 0 . 1 times the AUC at the recommended human dose ) , and alterations of the dentin composition at 600 mg / m2 / day .
Similar effects were not observed in adult dogs when dosed for 4 weeks or less .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In total , 59 % of HCC patients treated with sorafenib were age 65 years or older and 19 % were 75 and older .
No differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older and younger patients , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild , moderate or severe renal impairment who are not on dialysis .
The pharmacokinetics of sorafenib have not been studied in patients who are on dialysis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment .
The pharmacokinetics of sorafenib have not been studied in patients with severe ( Child - Pugh C ) hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE The adverse reactions observed at a dose of 800 mg twice daily ( 2 times the recommended dose ) were primarily diarrhea and dermatologic .
No information is available on symptoms of acute overdose in animals because of the saturation of absorption in oral acute toxicity studies conducted in animals .
In cases of suspected overdose , withhold sorafenib tablets and institute supportive care .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Sorafenib is a kinase inhibitor that decreases tumor cell proliferation in vitro .
Sorafenib was shown to inhibit multiple intracellular ( c - CRAF , BRAF and mutant BRAF ) and cell surface kinases ( KIT , FLT - 3 , RET , RET / PTC , VEGFR - 1 , VEGFR - 2 , VEGFR - 3 , and PDGFR - ß ) .
Several of these kinases are thought to be involved in tumor cell signaling , angiogenesis and apoptosis .
Sorafenib inhibited tumor growth of HCC and DTC human tumor xenografts in immunocompromised mice .
Reductions in tumor angiogenesis were seen in models of HCC upon sorafenib treatment , and increases in tumor apoptosis were observed in models of HCC and DTC .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of sorafenib 400 mg twice daily on the QTc interval was evaluated in a multi - center , open - label , non - randomized trial in 53 patients with advanced cancer .
No large changes in the mean QTc intervals ( that is , > 20 ms ) from baseline were detected in the trial .
After one 28 - day treatment cycle , the largest mean QTc interval change of 8 . 5 ms ( upper bound of two - sided 90 % confidence interval , 13 . 3 ms ) was observed at 6 hours post - dose on day 1 of cycle 2 [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Multiple doses of sorafenib for 7 days resulted in a 2 . 5 - to 7 - fold accumulation compared to a single dose .
Steady - state plasma sorafenib concentrations were achieved within 7 days , with a peak - to - trough ratio of mean concentrations of less than 2 .
The steady - state concentrations of sorafenib following administration of sorafenib 400 mg twice daily were evaluated in DTC , and HCC patients .
Patients with DTC have mean steady - state concentrations that are 1 . 8 - fold higher than patients with HCC .
The reason for increased sorafenib concentrations in DTC patients is unknown .
Mean Cmax and AUC increased less than proportionally beyond oral doses of 400 mg administered twice daily .
Absorption After administration of sorafenib tablets , the mean relative bioavailability was 38 to 49 % when compared to an oral solution .
Following oral administration , sorafenib reached peak plasma levels in approximately 3 hours .
Effects of Food With a moderate - fat meal ( 30 % fat ; 700 calories ) , bioavailability was similar to that in the fasted state .
With a high - fat meal ( 50 % fat ; 900 calories ) , bioavailability was reduced by 29 % compared to that in the fasted state .
Distribution In vitro binding of sorafenib to human plasma proteins was 99 . 5 % .
Elimination The mean elimination half - life of sorafenib was approximately 25 to 48 hours .
Metabolism Sorafenib undergoes oxidative metabolism by hepatic CYP3A4 , as well as glucuronidation by UGT1A9 .
Excretion Sorafenib accounted for approximately 70 to 85 % of the circulating analytes in plasma at steady - state .
Eight metabolites of sorafenib have been identified , of which 5 have been detected in plasma .
The main circulating metabolite of sorafenib , the pyridine N - oxide that comprises approximately 9 to 16 % of circulating analytes at steady - state , showed in vitro potency similar to that of sorafenib .
Following oral administration of a 100 mg dose of a solution formulation of sorafenib , 96 % of the dose was recovered within 14 days , with 77 % of the dose excreted in feces and 19 % of the dose excreted in urine as glucuronidated metabolites .
Unchanged sorafenib , accounting for 51 % of the dose , was found in feces but not in urine .
Specific Populations A study of the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib indicated that the mean AUC of sorafenib in Asians ( N = 78 ) was 30 % lower than in Whites ( N = 40 ) .
Sex and age do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib .
Patients with Renal Impairment Mild ( CLcr 50 to 80 mL / min ) , moderate ( CLcr 30 to < 50 mL / min ) , and severe ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) renal impairment do not affect the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Mild ( Child - Pugh A ) and moderate ( Child - Pugh B ) hepatic impairment do not affect the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Drug Interactions Studies Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors on Sorafenib : Ketoconazole , a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P - glycoprotein , administered at a dose of 400 mg once daily for 7 days did not alter the mean AUC of a single oral dose of sorafenib 50 mg in healthy subjects .
Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers on Sorafenib : Concomitant use of sorafenib with rifampin administered at a dose of 600 mg once daily for 5 days with a single oral dose of sorafenib 400 mg in healthy volunteers resulted in a 37 % decrease in the mean AUC of sorafenib .
Effect of Neomycin on Sorafenib : Neomycin administered as an oral dose of 1 gram three times daily for 5 days decreased the mean AUC of sorafenib by 54 % in healthy subjects administered a single oral dose of sorafenib 400 mg .
Effect of Sorafenib on Other Drugs : Sorafenib 400 mg twice daily for 28 days did not increase the systemic exposure of concomitantly administered midazolam ( CYP3A4 substrate ) , dextromethorphan ( CYP2D6 substrate ) , and omeprazole ( CYP2C19 substrate ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Drugs that Increase Gastric pH : The aqueous solubility of sorafenib is pH dependent , with higher pH resulting in lower solubility .
However , omeprazole , a proton pump inhibitor , administered at a dose of 40 mg once daily for 5 days , did not result in a clinically meaningful change in sorafenib single dose exposure .
In VitroStudies Sorafenib competitively inhibited CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , and CYP3A4 in vitro .
However , sorafenib 400 mg twice daily for 28 days with substrates of CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 did not increase the systemic exposure of these substrates [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
Sorafenib did not increase CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 activities , suggesting that sorafenib is unlikely to induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 in humans .
Sorafenib inhibits glucuronidation by UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 in vitro .
Sorafenib could increase the systemic exposure of concomitantly administered drugs that are UGT1A1 or UGT1A9 substrates .
Sorafenib inhibited P - glycoprotein in vitro .
Sorafenib could increase the concentrations of concomitantly administered drugs that are P - glycoprotein substrates .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with sorafenib .
Sorafenib was clastogenic when tested in an in vitro mammalian cell assay ( Chinese hamster ovary ) in the presence of metabolic activation .
Sorafenib was not mutagenic in the in vitro Ames bacterial cell assay or clastogenic in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
One intermediate in the manufacturing process , which is also present in the final drug substance ( < 0 . 15 % ) , was positive for mutagenesis in an in vitro bacterial cell assay ( Ames test ) when tested independently .
No specific studies with sorafenib have been conducted in animals to evaluate the effect on fertility .
However , results from the repeat - dose toxicity studies suggest there is a potential for sorafenib to impair reproductive function and fertility .
Multiple adverse effects were observed in male and female reproductive organs , with the rat being more susceptible than mice or dogs .
Typical changes in rats consisted of testicular atrophy or degeneration , degeneration of epididymis , prostate , and seminal vesicles , central necrosis of the corpora lutea and arrested follicular development .
Sorafenib - related effects on the reproductive organs of rats were manifested at daily oral doses ≥ 5 mg / kg ( 30 mg / m2 ) .
This dose results in an exposure ( AUC ) that is approximately 0 . 5 times the AUC in patients at the recommended human dose .
Dogs showed tubular degeneration in the testes at 30 mg / kg / day ( 600 mg / m2 / day ) .
This dose results in an exposure that is approximately 0 . 3 times the AUC at the recommended human dose .
Oligospermia was observed in dogs at 60 mg / kg / day ( 1 , 200 mg / m2 / day ) of sorafenib .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Hepatocellular Carcinoma The SHARP ( HCC ) study ( NCT00105443 ) was an international , multicenter , randomized , double blind , placebo - controlled trial in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma .
Overall survival was the primary endpoint .
A total of 602 patients were randomized ; 299 to sorafenib 400 mg twice daily and 303 to matching placebo .
All 602 randomized subjects were included in the ITT population for the efficacy analyses .
Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were similar between the sorafenib and placebo arms with regard to age , gender , race , performance status , etiology ( including hepatitis B , hepatitis C and alcoholic liver disease ) , TNM stage ( stage I : < 1 % vs . < 1 % ; stage II : 10 . 4 % vs . 8 . 3 % ; stage III : 37 . 8 % vs . 43 . 6 % ; stage IV : 50 . 8 % vs . 46 . 9 % ) , absence of both macroscopic vascular invasion and extrahepatic tumor spread ( 30 . 1 % vs . 30 . 0 % ) , and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage ( stage B : 18 . 1 % vs . 16 . 8 % ; stage C : 81 . 6 % vs . 83 . 2 % ; stage D : < 1 % vs . 0 % ) .
Liver impairment by Child - Pugh score was comparable between the sorafenib and placebo arms ( Class A : 95 % vs . 98 % ; B : 5 % vs . 2 % ) .
Only one patient with Child - Pugh class C was entered .
Prior treatments included surgical resection procedures ( 19 . 1 % vs . 20 . 5 % ) , locoregional therapies ( including radiofrequency ablation , percutaneous ethanol injection and transarterial chemoembolization ; 38 . 8 % vs . 40 . 6 % ) , radiotherapy ( 4 . 3 % vs . 5 % ) and systemic therapy ( 3 % vs . 5 % ) .
The trial was stopped for efficacy following a pre - specified second interim analysis for survival showing a statistically significant advantage for sorafenib over placebo for overall survival ( HR : 0 . 69 , p = 0 . 00058 ) ( see Table 10 and Figure 1 ) .
This advantage was consistent across all subsets analyzed .
Final analysis of time to tumor progression ( TTP ) based on data from an earlier time point ( by independent radiologic review ) also was significantly longer in the sorafenib arm ( HR : 0 . 58 , p = 0 . 000007 ) ( see Table 10 ) .

Randomization was stratified by age ( < 60 years versus ≥ 60 years ) and geographical region ( North America , Europe , and Asia ) .
All 417 subjects were included in the ITT population for the efficacy analyses .
All patients were required to have actively progressing disease defined as progression within 14 months of enrollment .
RAI - refractory disease was defined based on four criteria that were not mutually exclusive .
All RAI treatments and diagnostic scans were to be performed under conditions of a low iodine diet and adequate TSH stimulation .
Following are the RAI - refractory criteria and the proportion of patients in the study that met each one : a target lesion with no iodine uptake on RAI scan ( 68 % ) ; tumors with iodine uptake and progression after RAI treatment within 16 months of enrollment ( 12 % ) ; tumors with iodine uptake and multiple RAI treatments with the last treatment greater than 16 months prior to enrollment , and disease progression after each of two RAI treatments administered within 16 months of each other ( 7 % ) ; cumulative RAI dose ≥ 600 mCi administered ( 34 % ) .
The major efficacy outcome measure was progression - free survival ( PFS ) as determined by a blinded , independent radiological review using a modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v . 1 . 0 ( RECIST ) .
RECIST was modified by inclusion of clinical progression of bone lesions based on the need for external beam radiation ( 4 . 4 % of progression events ) .
Additional efficacy outcomes measures included overall survival ( OS ) , tumor response rate , and duration of response .
Patients were randomized to receive sorafenib 400 mg twice daily ( n = 207 ) or placebo ( n = 210 ) .
Of the 417 patients randomized , 48 % were male , the median age was 63 years , 61 % were 60 years or older , 60 % were white , 62 % had an ECOG performance status of 0 , and 99 % had undergone thyroidectomy .
The histological diagnoses were papillary carcinoma in 57 % , follicular carcinoma ( including Hürthle cell ) in 25 % , and poorly differentiated carcinoma in 10 % , and other in 8 % of the study population .
Metastases were present in 96 % of the patients : lungs in 86 % , lymph nodes in 51 % , and bone in 27 % .
The median cumulative RAI activity administered prior to study entry was 400 mCi .
A statistically significant prolongation of PFS was demonstrated for sorafenib - treated patients compared to those receiving placebo ( Figure 3 ) ; no statistically significant difference was seen in the final overall survival ( OS ) analysis ( Table 12 ) .
Crossover to open label sorafenib occurred in 161 ( 77 % ) patients randomized to placebo after investigator - determined disease progression .
