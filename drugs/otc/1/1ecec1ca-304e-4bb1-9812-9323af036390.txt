( 5 . 1 ) • Multiple non - thyroid radiation toxicities , including hematopoietic suppression : Individualize dose and monitor for toxicity .
( 5 . 2 ) • Embryo - Fetal toxicity : May cause severe and irreversible hypothyroidism in the neonate .
Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment .
Females and males of reproductive potential should use effective contraception .
( 5 . 4 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) • Radiation exposure to breast tissue with lactation : Sodium iodide I 131 concentrates in the breast of lactating women .
Discontinue breast feeding at least 6 weeks prior to therapy .
( 5 . 5 , 8 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Radiation - induced Thyroiditis Sodium iodide I 131 may cause thyroiditis with gland enlargement and release of thyroid hormone , which may cause or aggravate hyperthyroidism , thyroid storm and thyrotoxic cardiac disease [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
When treating hyperthyroidism , consider pre - treatment anti - thyroid medication to help deplete the thyroid hormone content within the gland .
Discontinue the anti - thyroid medication at least three days before administration of sodium iodide I 131 [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Consider a beta - blocker pre or post - treatment to minimize the risk of hyperthyroidism and thyroid storm .
Thyroiditis may cause gland enlargement resulting in tenderness and swelling of the neck , pain on swallowing , sore throat , and cough ; which may occur approximately the third day after sodium iodide I 131 administration .
Consider management with pain - reliever or anti - inflammatory medications .
5 . 2 Radiation - induced Toxicities Sodium Iodide I 131 may cause radiation induced toxicities [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] : • Dose - dependent fatalities ( bone marrow suppression , malignancy ) .
• Dose - dependent hematopoietic suppression which manifests as a transient thrombocytopenia or neutropenia 3 to 5 weeks following sodium iodide I 131 administrations , may lead to increased susceptibility to infections or bleeding .
• Salivary gland toxicity : sialadenitis , xerostomia .
• Lacrimal gland toxicity : conjunctivitis , xerophthalmia , and epiphora .
• Increased risk of developing new solid tumors and leukemias .
Obtain a complete blood count within one month of therapy .
If patients show leukopenia or thrombocytopenia , dosimetry should be used to determine a safe sodium iodide I 131 activity , while delivering less than 2 Gy to the bone marrow .
Advise good hydration for one week following sodium iodide I 131 administration and stimulate salivary flow via a sialagogue ( e . g . sugar - free candy or gum , pilocarpine , and ascorbic acid ) to reduce radiation exposure to the salivary glands .
Advise patients to void frequently after administration of radioiodide to enhance excretion .
5 . 3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis may occur in patients who receive sodium iodide I 131 .
Although iodide is not considered an allergen , hypersensitivity reactions may occur in relation with excipients or chemical component of the capsule , such as sodium thiosulfate .
Obtain and document an allergy history , particularly a sulfite allergy .
Emergency resuscitation equipment and personnel should be immediately available [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
5 . 4 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity HICON ® is contraindicated in pregnancy because sodium iodide I 131 crosses the placenta and fetal exposure can lead to neonatal hypothyroidism .
Multiple reports in the published literature describe hypothyroidism in the neonates following in utero exposure to sodium iodide I 131 .
Some cases of neonatal hypothyroidism were severe and irreversible .
Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating HICON ® treatment .
Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with HICON ® and for at least 6 months after the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 5 Increased Radiation Exposure to Breast Tissue with Lactation HICON ® is contraindicated in lactating women because sodium iodide I 131 concentrates in the breast via the increased expression of the sodium iodide symporter in breast tissue with lactation .
The literature describes moderate to marked radioiodine uptake in the breast tissue for 5 to 32 weeks post cessation of breast feeding .
Advise lactating women to discontinue breast feeding at least 6 weeks prior to administration of sodium iodide I 131 to allow sufficient time for involution to occur and to avoid excess concentration of sodium iodide I 131 in breast tissue .
Consider administration of drugs to suppress lactation .
Consider diagnostic scintigraphy before administration of sodium iodide I 131 to assess the persistence of uptake by breast tissue .
If sodium iodide I 131 is administered in the postpartum period , the lactating mother should not breastfeed the infant [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 6 Transient Infertility Transient dose - related impairment of testicular function in men and transient ovarian insufficiency in women has been reported after sodium iodide I 131 therapy .
Sperm banking for men may be considered prior to administration of HICON ® for thyroid carcinoma [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 7 Radiation Exposure to Other Individuals Household Contacts Instruct patients to follow radiation safety precautions after receiving HICON ® to minimize the radiation contamination of other persons or the environment .
Patients should avoid close contact with others , especially pregnant women and children , and take care to avoid contamination of other persons or the environment with body fluids .
Patients and Healthcare Providers HICON ® contributes to a patient ’ s overall long - term cumulative radiation exposure , which is associated with an increased risk of cancer .
Follow safe handling and administration to minimize radiation exposure to the patient and healthcare providers .
5 . 8 Risk of Decreased Effectiveness of Therapy Certain food or drugs may alter the thyroid uptake of sodium iodide I 131 and diminish its effectiveness .
Recent intake of stable iodide in any form , or the use of thyroid or anti - thyroid drugs may diminish thyroid uptake of sodium iodide I 131 [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .

( 5 . 8 , 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy .
( 4 ) • Lactation .
( 4 ) • Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : May impair fertility in females and males .
( 5 . 6 , 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary HICON ® is contraindicated in pregnancy because fetal exposure can lead to neonatal hypothyroidism , which in some cases is severe and irreversible [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Data from the published literature describe reports of neonatal thyroid abnormalities after fetal exposure ; including agenesis of the thyroid and hypothyroidism ( see Clinical Considerations , Data ) .
No animal reproductive studies have been conducted .
Clinical Considerations Fetal / Neonatal Adverse Reactions A fetus exposed to sodium iodide I 131 can develop neonatal hypothyroidism .
Delay in diagnosis of neonatal hypothyroidism after exposure to sodium iodide I 131 in utero can result in severe sequelae such as cognitive impairment and delayed bone age .
Monitor thyroid function in any infant born after in utero exposure to sodium iodide I 131 .
Data Human Data Sodium iodide I 131 crosses the placenta and the fetal thyroid begins to concentrate iodide during the 10 th to 12 th week of gestation .
In literature reports of maternal exposures to sodium iodide I 131 at doses of 333 MBq to 8 , 325 MBq ( 9 mCi to 225 mCi ) during 4 to 26 weeks gestational age , the most common adverse outcomes were hypothyroid infants and children .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary HICON ® is contraindicated during lactation because I 131 concentrates in the breast during lactation via the increased expression of the sodium iodide symporter in breast tissue and can lead to hypothyroidism in the infant through breastfeeding .
If sodium iodide I 131 is administered postpartum , breastfeeding should not be restarted for the remainder of the postpartum period .
In addition , to minimize the absorbed radiation dose to the breast tissue , breastfeeding and breast - pumping should be discontinued for at least 6 weeks before administration of sodium iodide I 131 [ see Data and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Infants exposed to sodium iodide I 131 through breast milk are at risk for development of hypothyroidism because sodium iodide I 131 is distributed into breast milk and may reach concentrations equal to or greater than concentrations in maternal plasma ( see Data ) .
Data Published literature describes sodium iodide I 131 transfer into breast milk and uptake by the thyroid of the breastfed infant .
The amount of sodium Iodide I 131 detected in the breast milk at 36 to 48 hours after administration is 1 % to 27 % of the injected dose ( with injected doses between 1 . 1 MBq ( 0 , 0297 mCi ) to 5 , 143 MBq ( 139 mCi ) ) .
8 . 3 Female and Males of Reproductive Potential HICON ® is contraindicated in pregnancy because of the risk of fetal hypothyroidism [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Obtain a pregnancy test in females of reproductive potential and verify the absence of pregnancy within 24 hours prior to administration of treatment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Contraception Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with HICON ® and for at least six months after the last dose of HICON ® .
Infertility Females Fertility may be impaired with HICON ® treatment .
Transient amenorrhea and ovarian insufficiency have been observed after sodium iodide I 131 therapy in females .
The literature describes reports of transient menstrual cycle irregularities , including amenorrhea , and ovarian failure in females treated with cumulative doses of 1 , 000 MBq to 59 , 000 MBq ( 27 mCi to 1 , 595 mCi ) sodium iodide I 131 .
In a published literature analysis , the effects on fertility occurred in up to 30 % of women treated with sodium iodide I 131 , and may resolve 12 months after treatment .
Males Fertility may be impaired with HICON ® treatment .
Discuss sperm banking for males who are expected to receive a high cumulative dose of sodium iodide I 131 .
Transient dose - related impairment of testicular function after sodium iodide I 131 therapy has been reported in the published literature .
The literature describes reports of males treated with sodium iodide I 131 at doses of 370 MBq to 22 , 000 MBq ( 10 mCi to 595 mCi ) resulting in transiently impaired testicular function ( including spermatogenesis ) .
The risk of persistent testicular dysfunction increases after administration of repeated or high cumulative radioiodide exposure .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of HICON ® have not been established in pediatric patients .
Pediatric patients are at an increased lifetime risk for malignancy from radiation exposure .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical experience has not identified differences in safety or effectiveness in geriatric patients compared to younger patients .
However , elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function and radiation exposure is greater in patients with impaired renal function [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment HICON ® is primarily excreted by the kidneys .
Renal function impairment decreases excretion of sodium iodide I 131 and increases the radiation exposure and risk of radiation toxicity .
For patients with a history of renal impairment , evaluate renal function for therapeutic planning and consider dosimetry .
Sodium Iodide I 131 is dialyzable .
Hemodialysis can be used to reduce total body radiation exposure [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE In case of exposure to a radioactive dose of sodium iodide I 131 exceeding the intended therapeutic dose , provide general supportive care , promote frequent voiding , monitor for bone marrow and thyroid suppression .
Consider administering a thyroid blocking agent ( e . g . potassium iodide ( KI ) or perchlorate ) promptly within 4 to 6 hours after the exposure .
Assess the benefit of administering a thyroid blocking agent against the risk of failure of sodium iodide I 131 therapy .
Appropriate replacement therapy is recommended if hypothyroidism occurs .
11 DESCRIPTION 11 . 1 Chemical Characteristics HICON ® , a radioactive therapeutic agent , provides a concentrated solution of sodium iodide I 131 with a radioconcentration of 37 , 000 MBq / mL ( 1 , 000 mCi / mL ) .
Each mL of the concentrated solution contains 37 , 000 MBq ( 1 , 000 mCi ) of no - carrier - added sodium iodide I 131 , disodium edetate dihydrate USP as a stabilizer , sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate USP as a reducing agent , and dibasic sodium phosphate anhydrous USP .
The pH of the concentrated solution is between 7 . 5 and 10 .
The concentrated solution provided with HICON ® is used for the preparation of sodium iodide I 131 capsules or sodium iodide I 131 solution of varying strengths for oral administration for therapy .
Sodium iodide I 131 solution is designated chemically as Na 131 I and has a molecular weight of 153 . 99 g / mol .
Hard gelatin capsules , provided for the preparation of the sodium iodide I 131 capsules final dosage form , contain approximately 300 mg of dibasic sodium phosphate anhydrous USP as the absorbing buffer .
11 . 2 Physical Characteristics Iodide I 131 decays by beta emission and associated gamma emission with a physical half - life of 8 . 02 days .
The principal radiation emissions are listed in Table 5 .

Iodide is concentrated in follicular cells to levels up to 50 times higher than in the plasma .
Iodide is metabolically oxidized by thyroid peroxidase to iodinium ( I + ) which in turn iodinates tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin ( tri or tetra - iodinated tyrosine ) .
The beta emission of I 131 is responsible for the therapeutic effect .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The relationship between the extent of iodide I 131 exposure and pharmacologic effects has not been explored in clinical trials .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of HICON ® , 90 % of the administered radioactivity of sodium iodide I 131 is systemically absorbed in the first 60 minutes .
Distribution Following absorption , sodium iodide I 131 is distributed within the extra - cellular space .
It is actively transported by the sodium - iodide symporter ( NIS ) protein , and binds to thyroglobulin resulting in accumulation in the thyroid .
The thyroid uptake of iodide is usually increased in hyperthyroidism and in goiter , and is decreased in hypothyroidism .
Sodium iodide I 131 also accumulates in the stomach , choroid plexus , salivary glands , breast , liver , gall bladder , and kidneys .
Elimination Metabolism In thyroidal follicular cells iodide is oxidized through the action of thyroid peroxidase to iodinium ( I + ) which in turn iodinates tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin .
Excretion Sodium iodide I 131 is excreted in urine and feces .
The normal range of urinary excretion is 37 % to 75 % of the administered dose , varying with the thyroid and renal function of the patient .
Fecal excretion is about 10 % .
