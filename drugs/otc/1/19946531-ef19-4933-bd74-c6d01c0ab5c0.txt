Warning : Hypotonic and hemolytic .
Do not inject until made approximately isotonic by addition of appropriate solute .
DESCRIPTION Sterile Water for Injection USP is a clear , colorless , odorless liquid .
It is sterile , hypotonic , nonpyrogenic , and contains no bacteriostatic or antimicrobial agents .
Sterile Water for Injection USP is a diluent or solvent suitable for intravascular injection after first having been made approximately isotonic by the addition of suitable solute .
pH : 5 . 5 ( 5 . 0 – 7 . 0 ) Not made with natural rubber latex , PVC or DEHP .
The plastic container is made from a multilayered film specifically developed for parenteral drugs .
It contains no plasticizers and exhibits virtually no leachables .
The solution contact layer is a rubberized copolymer of ethylene and propylene .
The container is nontoxic and biologically inert .
The container - solution unit is a closed system and is not dependent upon entry of external air during administration .
The container is overwrapped to provide protection from the physical environment and to provide an additional moisture barrier when necessary .
Addition of medication should be accomplished using complete aseptic technique .
The closure system has two ports ; the one for the administration set has a tamper evident plastic protector and the other is a medication addition site .
Refer to the Directions for Use of the container .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Sterile Water for Injection USP is used as a diluent or solvent for other parenteral drugs .
As such , Sterile Water for Injection USP contributes to the water for hydration when provided in parenteral drug and fluid therapy , after the introduction of suitable additives and / or mixture with suitable solutes to approximate isotonicity .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sterile Water for Injection USP is indicated for use in adults and pediatric patients as a diluent or solvent in the aseptic preparation of parenteral solutions or as a vehicle for drug administration .
CONTRAINDICATIONS None known .
WARNINGS Hypotonic and hemolytic .
Do not inject until made approximately isotonic by addition of an appropriate solute , due to the possibility of hemolysis .
The administration of intravenous solutions can cause fluid and / or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration .
WARNING : This product contains aluminum that may be toxic .
Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired .
Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature , and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions , which contain aluminum .
Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function , including premature neonates , who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg / kg / day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity .
Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration .
PRECAUTIONS General To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from the mixing of additives that may be prescribed , the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing , prior to administration and periodically during administration .
Do not use plastic containers in series connection .
If administration is controlled by a pumping device , care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result .
If administration is not controlled by a pumping device , refrain from applying excessive pressure ( > 300 mmHg ) causing distortion to the container such as wringing or twisting .
Such handling could result in breakage of the container .
This solution is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment .
It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours .
Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact .
The drug product contains no more than 25 mcg / L of aluminum .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Refer to the package insert of the solute used .
Usage in Pregnancy Refer to the package insert of the solute used .
Nursing Mothers Refer to the package insert of the solute used .
Pediatric Use Refer to the package insert of the solute used .
See WARNINGS section regarding aluminum .
Geriatric Use Refer to the package insert of the solute used .
See WARNINGS section regarding aluminum .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Refer to the package insert of the solute used .
Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response , infection at the site of injection , venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection , extravasation and hypervolemia .
The physician should also be alert to the possibility of adverse reactions to drug additives .
Prescribing information for drug additives to be administered in this manner should be consulted .
If an adverse reaction does occur , discontinue the infusion , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
OVERDOSAGE Overdosage ( hypotonic expansion ) is a function of an increase in fluid intake over fluid output , and occurs when the increase in the volume of body fluids is due to water alone .
Overdosage may occur in patients who receive large quantities of electrolyte - free water to replace abnormal excessive fluid losses , in patients whose renal tolerance to water loads is exceeded , or in patients who retain water postoperatively in response to stress .
Manifestations of water intoxication are behavioral changes ( confusion , apathy , disorientation and attendant hyponatremia ) , central nervous system disturbances ( weakness , muscle twitching , headaches , nausea , vomiting , convulsions ) and weight gain .
Treatment consists of withholding fluids until excessive water is excreted .
In severe hyponatremia it may be necessary to cautiously administer hypertonic saline to increase extracellular osmotic pressure and excretion of excess water by the kidneys .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION This solution is for intravenous use only .
Do not inject until made approximately isotonic by addition of appropriate solute .
The dosage and administration of Sterile Water for Injection USP is dependent upon the recommended dosage and administration of the solute used .
Fluid administration should be based on calculated maintenance or replacement fluid requirements for each patient .
Some additives may be incompatible .
Consult with pharmacist .
When introducing additives , use aseptic techniques .
Mix thoroughly .
Do not store .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
