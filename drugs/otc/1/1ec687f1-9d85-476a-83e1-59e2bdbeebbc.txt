WARNINGS Standardized allergenic extract is intended for use by physicians who are experienced in the administration of standardized ( BAU / mL ) allergenic extracts for immunotherapy and the emergency care of anaphylaxis , or for use under the guidance of an allergy specialist .
For previously untreated patients , the initial dose must be based on skin testing as described in the dosage and administration section of this insert .
Standardized Grass Pollen extract is NOT directly interchangeable with Grass Pollen extracts labeled in AU / mL , or with non - standardized Grass Pollen extracts .
This product should not be injected intravenously .
Deep subcutaneous routes have proven to be safe .
Sensitive patients may experience severe anaphylactic reactions resulting in respiratory obstruction , shock , coma and / or death .
( See Adverse Reactions ) Serious adverse reactions should be reported to Nelco Laboratories immediately and a report filed to : MedWatch , The FDA Medical Product Problem Reporting Program , at 5600 Fishers Lane , Rockville , Md . 20852 - 9787 , call 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 .
Extreme caution should be taken when using allergenic extracts for patients who are taking beta - blocker medications .
In the event of a serious adverse reaction associated with the use of allergenic extracts , patients receiving beta - blockers may not be responsive to epinephrine or inhaled bronchodialators .
( 1 ) ( See Precautions ) Allergenic extracts should be used with caution in patients with unstable or steroid - dependent asthma or with underlying cardiovascular disease .
( See Contraindications ) DESCRIPTION Standardized Grass Pollen Extracts include : Orchard ( Dactylis glomerata ) , Perennial Rye ( Lolium perenne ) , Timothy ( Phleum pratense ) , Redtop ( Agrostis alba ) , Kentucky ( June ) Bluegrass ( Poa pratensis ) , Bermuda ( Cynodon dactylon ) , Meadow Fescue ( Festuca elatior ) , Sweet Vernal ( Anthoxanthum odoratum ) .
The standardized grass pollen extract is prepared by extracting raw pollen material at a ratio of either 1 : 5 w / v , 1 : 6 . 66 w / v or 1 : 10 w / v in Cocas fluid containing 0 . 5 % NaCl , 0 . 275 % NaHCO3 , WFI and 0 . 4 % phenol as preservative .
Following extraction , a calculated amount of glycerin is added to make a 50 % ( v / v ) glycerinated solution .
Standardized Grass Pollen extracts have potency designations of 10 , 000 BAU / mL and 100 , 000 BAU / mL except Bermuda Grass ( 10 , 000 BAU / mL only ) .
Extracts with a potency of 10 , 000 BAU / mL are diluted from the 100 , 000 BAU / mL lots with Glycerol Saline 50 % ( v / v ) .
The Glycerol Saline 50 % ( v / v ) solution consists of Glycerin and Salts and Buffered Diluent whose ingredients are 0 . 5 % NaCl , 0 . 08 % Na2HPO4 , 0 . 036 % KH2PO4 , WFI and 0 . 4 % phenol as a preservative .
All extracts are aseptically filled in sterile containers .
Standardized pollen extracts are intended for administration by prick - puncture or intradermal routes when used for diagnostic purposes and administered subcutaneously when used for immunotherapy injection .
Standardized grass pollen extracts labeled in BAU / mL are not interchangeable with grass pollen extracts labeled in AU / mL or with non - standardized grass pollen extracts .
The Bioequivalent Allergy Unit ( BAU ) , the potency unit used for all Standardized Pollen Extracts , replaces the previous unitage for these products .
Bioequivalent Allergy Units were assigned to the FDA , Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research ( CBER ) reference extracts , based on quantitative intradermal skin test results .
BAU ' s are intended to assure that the labeled unitage of different allergenic extracts will correspond to the expected clinical response in sensitive patients .
References labeled 10 , 000 BAU / mL can be diluted one half million fold to produce an intradermal sum of erythema diameter response of 50 mm in highly puncture reactive subjects .
100 , 000 BAU / mL can be diluted 1 : 5 million fold to yield the same intradermal response .
( 2 ) The assignment of BAU / mL to standardized grass pollen extracts , is accomplished by an ELISA assay comparing the extract to the CBER reference .
Previously , the potency / concentration of grass mixtures was designated based on the manufacturing strength , e . g . 1 : 10 w / v or 1 : 20 w / v , or in PNU ' s / mL .
For grass mixtures containing standardized extracts , the potency will reflect the contribution of each individual component in the mixture , i . e . , the actual potency of each component will be listed on a per mL basis .
In addition , because the individual components may be cross - reactive , an additional caution statement , " due to cross reactivity , total potency may be 100 , 000 BAU / mL , " will be added to the label .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mode of action of allergenic extracts is still under investigation .
The pharmacological action of allergenic extracts used diagnostically is based on the liberation of histamine and other substances when the allergen reacts with IgE antibodies attached to the mast cells .
When allergenic extracts are used for therapeutic immunotherapy , the effect is an increase in immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) and an increased T suppresser lymphocyte which interferes with the allergic response .
( 3 ) Although immunotherapy may be considered as immunosuppression , in which the production of allergen - specific antibody is inhibited , the mechanism of the clinical effectiveness of immunotherapy remains under investigation .
Assignment of BAU / mL potency designation was determined based on Puncture and Intradermal Data with CBER Grass References .

INDICATIONS AND USAGE Standardized Pollen Extract is intended for use in the diagnosis and therapy of pollen allergic patients as established by allergy history and skin test reactivity .
Standardized Grass Pollen extracts labeled in BAU / mL are not interchangeable with Grass Pollen extracts labeled in AU / mL or with non - standardized Grass Pollen extracts .
The 10 , 000 BAU / mL dose form is indicated for percutaneous testing .
If negative , 100 , 000 BAU / mL dose form can be used for percutaneous testing .
For immunotherapy , availability of 10 , 000 and 100 , 000 BAU / mL dosages facilitates safe switching .
( See Dosage & Administration ) The use of standardized grass pollen extracts is indicated for hyposensitization treatment and may be used as part of the over - all management of the allergic patient .
Treatment of grass sensitive patients consists of using specific standardized grass products of up to and including doses of 100 , 000 BAU / mL ( up to 10 , 000 BAU / mL for Bermuda grass ) or stock mixtures of standardized grass products .
Stock mixtures of standardized grass extracts are particularly useful in hyposensitization treatment when multiple allergies to grasses are diagnosed .
For previously untreated patients , the 10 , 000 BAU / mL concentrates can be used to formulate dosages .
If tolerated , the concentrates can be inceased to 100 , 000 BAU / mL dose formulation .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Standardized Pollen extract should not be used if the patient has asthma , cardiovascular disease , emphysema , diabetes , bleeding diathesis or pregnancy , unless a specific diagnosis of type 1 allergy to Pollen is made based on skin testing and the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks of an adverse reaction during testing or treatment .
Pollen extract is not indicated for use in patients who are not clinically allergic to pollen or who are not skin reactive to pollen .
Limitations on treatment should be considered when treating the very young , or geriatric patients or those suffering from auto - immune disorders or severe and unstable allergic disorders .
WARNINGS Concentrated extracts must be diluted with sterile diluent prior to first use on a patient for treatment or intradermal testing .
DO NOT INJECT INTRAVENOUSLY .
All concentrates of allergenic extracts have the ability to cause serious local and systemic reactions including death in sensitive patients .
( 3 ) ( See Adverse Reactions ) Standardized Pollen extracts should be used with caution when treating patients who exhibit hypersensitivity to standardized pollen extracts as confirmed by diagnostic testing .
An allergenic extract should be temporarily withheld from patients or the dose of the extract adjusted downward if any of the following conditions exist : ( 1 ) Severe symptoms of rhinitis and / or asthma ( 2 ) Infections or flu accompanied by fever and ( 3 ) Exposure to excessive amounts of clinically relevant allergen prior to a scheduled injection .
PRECAUTIONS General : Epinephrine 1 : 1000 should be available as well as personnel trained in administering emergency treatment .
Allergenic Extracts are not intended for intravenous injections .
For safe and effective use of allergenic extracts , sterile diluents , sterile vials , sterile syringes should be used and aseptic precautions observed when making a dilution and / or administering the allergenic extract injection .
A sterile tuberculin syringe graduated in 0 . 1 mL units to measure each dose for the prescribed dilution should be used .
To reduce the risk of an occurrence of adverse reactions , begin with a careful personal history plus a physical exam .
Confirm your findings with scratch or intradermal skin testing .
Patients should be observed for 30 minutes after any test .
Information for Patients : All concentrates of allergenic extracts including standardized pollen extracts , have the potential to cause serious local and systemic reactions including death , in sensitive patients .
To minimize this potential hazard , the relative sensitivity of the patient must be assessed from an allergic history and clinical observations .
In certain individuals , life - threatening reactions may occur .
Patients should be informed of this risk prior to skin testing and immunotherapy .
Patients should be instructed to recognize adverse reaction symptoms that may occur and to report all adverse reactions to a physician and to wait in the office at least 30 minutes after an injection .
Drug Interactions : Antihistamines and Hydroxyzine can significantly inhibit the immediate skin test reactions as they tend to neutralize or antagonize the action of histamine .
( 3 ) This effect has been primarily documented when testing was performed within 1 to 2 hours after drug ingestion , although partial inhibition of the skin test reaction had been observed for longer periods .
Epinephrine injection inhibits the immediate skin test reactions for several hours .
Patients on delayed absorption antihistamine tablets should be free of such medication for 48 hours before testing .
Patients using Astemizole ( Hismanal ) may experience prolonged suppression and should be free from such medication for up to 6 to 8 weeks prior to testing .
Refer to package insert from a long acting antihistamine manufacturer for more information .
Extreme caution should be taken when using allergenic extracts in patients who are taking beta - blockers .
Patients receiving beta - blockers may not be responsive to epinephrine or inhaled bronchodialators .
Carcinogenesis , mutagenesis , impairment of fertility .
Long term studies in animals have not been conducted with allergenic extracts , including Pollen extracts , to determine their potential carcinogenicity , mutagenicity or impairment of fertility .
Pregnancy : Category C . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with allergenic extract .
It is not known whether this extract can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant women or can effect reproduction capacity .
Due to histamines ability to induce uterine contractions , allergenic extract should be given to pregnant women only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers : It is not known whether this drug appears in human milk .
Because many drugs are detected in human milk , caution should be exercised when Allergenic Extracts are administered to a nursing woman .
There are no current studies on extract components in human milk , or their effect on the nursing infant .
Pediatric Use : Allergenic extracts have been used in children over two years of age .
( 4 ) ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse systemic reactions usually occur within minutes and consist primarily of allergic symptoms such as : generalized skin erythema , urticaria , pruritus , angioedema , rhinitis , wheezing , laryngeal edema , itching of nose and throat , breathlessness , dyspnea , coughing , hypotension and marked perspiration .
Less commonly , nausea , emesis , abdominal cramps , diarrhea and uterine contractions may occur .
Severe reactions may cause anaphylaxis or shock and loss of consciousness .
In rare instances this may result in death .
The treatment of systemic allergic reactions is dependent upon the system complex .
Antihistamines may offer relief of recurrent urticaria , associated skin reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms .
Corticosteroids may provide benefit if symptoms are prolonged or recurrent .
( See Overdosage ) Local Reactions consisting of erythema , itching , swelling tenderness and sometimes pain may occur at the injection site .
These reactions may appear within a few minutes to hours and persist for several days .
Local cold applications and oral antihistamines may be effective treatment .
For marked and prolonged local reactions the use of antihistamines or anti - inflammatory medications may be indicated .
Serious adverse reactions should be reported to Nelco Laboratories immediately and a report can be filed to : MedWatch , The FDA Medical Product Problem Reporting Program , at 5600 Fishers Lane , Rockville , MD 20852 - 9787 , call 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 .
OVERDOSAGE An overdose can cause both local and systemic reactions .
An overdose is prevented by careful observation and questioning the patient about reactions to previous extract injections .
If systemic or anaphylactic reaction does occur , apply a tourniquet above the site of injection and inject intramuscularly or subcutaneously 0 . 3 to 0 . 5 mL of 1 : 1000 epinephrine hydrochloride into the opposite arm .
The dose may be repeated in 5 - 10 minutes if necessary .
Loosen the tourniquet at least every 10 minutes .
The epinephrine hydrochloride 1 : 1000 dose for infants to 2 years is 0 . 05 to 0 . 1 mL , for children 2 to 6 years it is 0 . 15 mL , for children 6 - 12 years it is 0 . 2 mL .
Patients unresponsive to epinephrine may be treated with intravenous bronchodilators .
Studies on asthmatic subjects reveal that plasma concentrations of theophylline of 5 to 20 µg / mL are associated with therapeutic effects .
Toxicity is particularly apparent at concentrations greater than 20 µg / mL .
A loading dose of aminophylline of 5 . 8 mg / kg intravenously followed by 0 . 9 mg / kg per hour results in plasma concentrations of approximately 10 µg / mL for patients not previously receiving theophylline .
( Mitenko , Ogilive 1973 ; Nicholoson , Chick 1973 ) Other beta - adrenergic drugs such as Isoproterenol , Isoetharine , or Albuterol may be used by inhalation .
The usual dose to relieve broncho - constriction in asthma is 0 . 5 mL of the 0 . 5 % solution for Isoproterenol HCl .
The Albuterol inhaler delivers approximately 90 mcg of Albuterol from the mouthpiece .
The usual dosage for adults and children would be two inhalations repeated every 4 - 6 hours .
Isoetharine supplied in the Bronkometer unit delivers approximately 340 mcg Isoetharine .
The average dose is one to two inhalations .
Persistent wheezing may necessitate intravenous aminophylline treatment .
For profound shock and hypotension , intravenous fluids , vasopressors and oxygen may also be needed .
Respiratory obstruction not responding to parenteral or inhaled bronchodilators may require oxygen , intubation and the use of life support systems .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION It is imperative that the physician determine a safe initial dose .
Patients being switched from one lot of Standardized Pollen to another lot of Standardized Pollen ( from the same or different manufacturers ) should have the initial dose from the new lot reduced by 75 % .
For patients being switched from non - standardized extract to a standardized extract , the selection of dose needs to be based on the dose of the extract currently administered and the relative potency with regards to the standardized extract .
( See Clinical Pharmacology Table C for a comparison of standardized and non - standardized pollen extracts ) .
Side by side comparison of wheal and erythema by skin testing of standardized and non - standardized extract can be carried out to determine comparability of doses selected .
For safe and effective use of allergenic extracts , sterile solutions , vials , syringes , etc . should be used and aseptic precautions followed when making dilution ' s and giving injections .
The usual precautions to be observed in administering extracts are necessary .
A sterile tuberculin syringe graduated in 0 . 1 mL units to measure each dose for the prescribed dilution should be used .
After therapeutic injections patients should always be observed for at least 30 minutes .
If adverse reactions appear , the next therapeutic injection of extract should be reduced to the dose which does not elicit a reaction and subsequent doses increased more slowly .
Recommended dosage and range : ( Scratch or Prick tests ) The general method of making a scratch test is to first scarify the skin and then apply a drop of extract to the scratch .
Make scarifications at least 2 . 5 cm apart .
Hold the scarifier between thumb and index finger , press the sharp edge of the instrument against the skin and twirl instrument rapidly .
The scratch should disrupt the outer layers of epidermis but should not produce immediate oozing of blood .
One drop ( 0 . 05 mL ) of extract is rubbed or applied into each scratch .
Always apply a control scratch with each test set .
Sterile Diluent ( for a negative control ) is used in exactly the same way as an active test extract .
Histamine may be used as a positive control .
Scratch or prick test sites should be examined at 15 and 30 minutes .
To prevent excessive absorption , wipe off antigens producing large reactions as soon as the wheal appears .
Record the size of the reaction .
The concentration of Standardized Pollen extract for Scratch or Prick - puncture testing is prepared using 10 , 000 BAU / mL .
If negative , 100 , 000 BAU / mL can be used to determine sensitivity of the patient .
Recommended dosage and range : ( Intradermal tests ) Patients with a negative scratch or prick - puncture test : Patients who do not react to a valid scratch or prick - puncture test should be tested intradermally with 0 . 05 mL of a 50 BAU / mL extract solution .
If this test is negative , a second intradermal test may be performed using a 100 BAU / mL extract dilution .
The negative puncture test control must be diluted appropriately for intradermal use .
To prepare a 50 BAU / mL dilution from Nelco ' s 10 , 000 BAU / mL vial : Take 5 . 0 mL of the 10 , 000 BAU / mL + 5 . 0 mL of diluent equals Vial A at 5 , 000 BAU / mL .
Take 1 . 0 mL of Vial A + 9 . 0 mL diluent equals Vial B at 500 BAU / mL .
Take 1 . 0 mL of Vial B + 9 . 0 mL diluent equals Vial C at 50 BAU / mL .
Patients tested only by the intradermal method : ( See table B ) Patients being suspected of being highly allergic should be tested with 0 . 05 mL of a 0 . 1 BAU / mL dilution .
A negative test should be followed by repeat tests using progressively stronger concentrations until the maximal recommended strength of 100 BAU / mL is reached .
The negative puncture test control must be diluted appropriately for intradermal use .
To prepare this dilution follow the tenfold dilution series chart for therapeutic allergens .
Skin tests are graded in terms of the wheal and erythema response noted at 10 to 20 minutes .
Wheal and erythema size may be recorded by actual measurement as compared with positive and negative controls .
Preparation Instructions : To prepare a dilution for intradermal and therapeutic use , one starts with 10 , 000 BAU / mL stock concentrate and makes a 1 : 10 dilution by adding 1 . 0 mL of the concentrate to 9 . 0 mL of sterile diluent .
Subsequent dilutions are made in similar manner .

The dosage of allergenic extract does not vary significantly with the respiratory allergic disease under treatment .
In patients who appear to be highly sensitive by history and skin test , the initial dose of the extract should be 0 . 05 mL of 5 BAU / mL which results in a dosage of 0 . 25 BAU .
Patients with lesser sensitivity may be started using 1 BAU / mL .
The amount of allergenic extract is increased at each injection by not more than 50 % - 100 % of the previous amount , and the next increment is governed by the response to the last injection .
Any evidence of systemic reaction is an indication for a significant reduction ( at least 50 % ) in the subsequent dose .
Any evidence of a local or generalized reaction requires a reduction in dosage .
After therapeutic injections , patients should always be observed for at least 20 minutes .
If adverse reactions appear , the next therapeutic injection of extract should be reduced to the dose which dose not elicit a reaction and subsequent doses increased more slowly .
The upper limits of dosage have not been established .
Doses larger than 0 . 2 mL of 10 , 000 BAU / mL may be painful due to glycerin content .
Dosage use of up to 100 , 000 BAU / mL is determined by patient response and administered at the discretion of the physician .
Suggested Dosage Charts * ( Note Disclaimer ) * This is a suggested dose chart only .
Dose regimen has not been subjected to adequate and well controlled studies to determine safety and efficacy .
Please read entire instructions before commencing immunotherapy .
Observe patients for 30 minutes after an injection .
Note : Certain individuals may not tolerate this suggested schedule .
The physician may need to adjust both the dosage and interval accordingly .

Therefore , a physician must determine each patient ' s maintenance dose .
Intervals between doses : The optimal interval between doses of allergenic extract has not been definitely established .
However , as it is customary practiced , injections are given once or twice per week until the maintenance dose of extract is reached .
At this time , the injection interval may be increased to 2 weeks , then 3 weeks and finally to 4 weeks .
If the patient does not return for 6 - 8 weeks after the last injection , the dose should be reduced to 25 % of the last dose .
If longer than 8 weeks , a dose reduction of 1 , 2 , or 3 dilutions may be made depending on a consideration of the components and the patient ' s sensitivity .
( 3 ) The dosage and the interval between injections may need to be modified according to the clinical response of the patient .
When switching patients to a new extract the initial dose should be reduced 3 / 4 so that 25 % of previous dose is administered .
Duration of Treatment : The usual duration of treatment has not been established .
A period of two or three years of injection therapy constitutes an average minimum course of treatment .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
