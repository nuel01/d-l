12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action ISOPLATE SOLUTION contains the following key components to maintain platelet function : • Sodium chloride for osmolarity • Acetate to fuel platelet metabolism • Gluconate or phosphate for buffering • Magnesium and potassium to reduce platelet activation1 , 2 This solution has no pharmacological effect ; the solution provides the appropriate components for platelet function while allowing for a lower volume of plasma in the platelet product during storage .
