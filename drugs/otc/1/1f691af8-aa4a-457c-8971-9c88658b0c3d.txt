Potassium Chloride Injection mEq Potassium / Container Composition ( g / L ) Potassium Chloride , USP ( KCl ) Osmolarity * ( mOsmol / L ) ( calc ) pH Ionic Concentration ( mEq / L ) Potassium Chloride 10 mEq / 100 mL 7 . 45 200 5 . 8 ( 4 . 0 to 8 . 0 ) 100 100 10 mEq / 50 mL 20 mEq / 100 mL 14 . 9 400 5 . 8 ( 4 . 0 to 8 . 0 ) 200 200 20 mEq / 50 mL 40 mEq / 100 mL 29 . 8 799 5 . 8 ( 4 . 0 to 8 . 0 ) 400 400 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Potassium is the major cation of body cells ( 160 mEq / liter of intracellular water ) and is concerned with the maintenance of body fluid composition and electrolyte balance .
Potassium participates in carbohydrate utilization , protein synthesis , and is critical in the regulation of nerve conduction and muscle contraction , particularly in the heart .
Chloride , the major extracellular anion , closely follows the metabolism of sodium , and changes in the acid - base of the body are reflected by changes in the chloride concentration .
Normally about 80 to 90 % of the potassium intake is excreted in the urine , the remainder in the stools and to a small extent , in the perspiration .
The kidney does not conserve potassium well so that during fasting , or in patients on a potassium - free diet , potassium loss from the body continues resulting in potassium depletion .
A deficiency of either potassium or chloride will lead to a deficit of the other .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Potassium Chloride Injection is indicated in the treatment of potassium deficiency states when oral replacement is not feasible .
THIS HIGHLY CONCENTRATED , READY - TO - USE POTASSIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION IS INTENDED FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF SERUM K + LEVELS AND FOR POTASSIUM SUPPLEMENTATION IN FLUID RESTRICTED PATIENTS WHO CANNOT ACCOMMODATE ADDITIONAL VOLUMES OF FLUID ASSOCIATED WITH POTASSIUM SOLUTIONS OF LOWER CONCENTRATION .
When using these products , these patients should be on continuous cardiac monitoring and frequent testing for serum potassium concentration and acid - base balance .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Potassium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in diseases where high potassium levels may be encountered , and in patients with hyperkalemia , renal failure and in conditions in which potassium retention is present .
WARNINGS THIS HIGHLY CONCENTRATED , READY - TO - USE POTASSIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION IS INTENDED FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF SERUM K + LEVELS AND FOR POTASSIUM SUPPLEMENTATION IN FLUID RESTRICTED PATIENTS WHO CANNOT ACCOMMODATE ADDITIONAL VOLUMES OF FLUID ASSOCIATED WITH POTASSIUM SOLUTIONS OF LOWER CONCENTRATION .
TO AVOID POTASSIUM INTOXICATION , DO NOT INFUSE THESE SOLUTIONS RAPIDLY .
PATIENTS REQUIRING HIGHLY CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS SHOULD BE KEPT ON CONTINUOUS CARDIAC MONITORING AND UNDERGO FREQUENT TESTING FOR SERUM POTASSIUM AND ACID - BASE BALANCE , ESPECIALLY IF THEY RECEIVE DIGITALIS .
In patients with renal insufficiency , administration of potassium chloride may cause potassium intoxication and life - threatening hyperkalemia .
Administer intravenously only with a calibrated infusion device at a slow , controlled rate .
( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . )
Because pain associated with peripheral infusion of Potassium Chloride solution has been reported , whenever possible administration via a central route is recommended for thorough dilution by the blood stream and avoidance of extravasation .
The highest concentration ( 400 mEq / L ) should be exclusively administered via central route .
The administration of intravenous solutions can cause fluid and / or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration .
The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentration .
PRECAUTIONS Laboratory Tests Serum potassium levels are not necessarily indicative of tissue potassium levels .
Solutions containing potassium should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac or renal disease .
Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance , electrolyte concentrations , and acid - base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation .
Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require the use of additional electrolyte supplements , or the use of electrolyte - free dextrose solutions to which individualized electrolyte supplements may be added .
Pregnancy : Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with potassium chloride .
It is also not known whether potassium chloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Potassium chloride should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Pediatric Use : These products should not be used in pediatric patients at this time .
Do not administer unless solution is clear and seal is intact .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Potassium intoxication with mild or severe hyperkalemia has been reported .
The signs and symptoms of intoxication include paresthesia of the extremities , areflexia , muscular or respiratory paralysis , mental confusion , weakness , hypotension , cardiac arrhythmia , heart block , electrographic abnormalities and cardiac arrest .
EKG abnormalities serve as a clinical reflection of the seriousness of changes in serum potassium concentrations : peaked T waves and prolonged P - R intervals usually occur with modest elevations above the upper limit of normal potassium concentrations ; P waves disappear , the QRS complex widens , and eventual asystole usually occurs with higher elevations .
Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response , infection at the site of injection , venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection , extravasation and hypervolemia .
Infusion of highly concentrated potassium chloride solutions may cause local pain and vein irritation .
( See WARNINGS ) .
Reactions reported with the use of potassium - containing solutions include nausea , vomiting , and abdominal pain and diarrhea .
If an adverse reaction does occur , discontinue the infusion , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of hyperkalemia , discontinue the infusion immediately and institute corrective therapy to reduce serum potassium levels as necessary .
The use of potassium containing foods or medications must also be eliminated .
Treatment of mild to severe hyperkalemia with signs and symptoms of potassium intoxication includes the following : • Dextrose Injection , USP , 10 % or 25 % , containing 10 units of crystalline insulin per 20 grams of dextrose administered intravenously , 300 to 500 mL per hour .
• Absorption and exchange of potassium using sodium or ammonium cycle cation exchange resin , orally and as retention enema .
• Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis .
In cases of digitalization , too rapid a lowering of plasma potassium concentration can cause digitalis toxicity .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dose and rate of administration are dependent upon the specific condition of each patient .
Administer intravenously only with a calibrated infusion device at a slow , controlled rate .
Because pain associated with peripheral infusion of Potassium Chloride solution has been reported , whenever possible , administration via central route is recommended for thorough dilution by the blood stream and avoidance of extravasation .
The Highest concentration ( 400 mEq / L ) should be exclusively administered via central route .
Recommended administration rates should not usually exceed 10 mEq / hour or 200 mEq for a 24 - hour period if the serum potassium level is greater than 2 . 5 mEq / liter .
In urgent cases where the serum potassium level is less than 2 mEq / liter or where severe hypokalemia is a threat ( serum potassium level less than 2 mEq / liter and electrocardiographic changes and / or muscle paralysis ) , rates up to 40 mEq / hour or 400 mEq over a 24 - hour period can be administered very carefully when guided by continuous monitoring of the EKG and frequent serum K + determinations to avoid hyperkalemia and cardiac arrest .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration , whenever solution and container permit .
Use of a final filter is recommended during administration of all parenteral solutions where possible .
Do not add supplementary medication .
Preparation for Administration ( Use aseptic technique ) • Close flow control clamp of administration set .
• Remove cover from outlet port at bottom of container .
• Insert piercing pin of administration set into port with a twisting motion until the set is firmly seated .
NOTE : See full directions on administration set carton .
• Suspend container from hanger .
• Squeeze and release drip chamber to establish proper fluid level in chamber .
• Open flow control clamp and clear air from set .
Close clamp .
• Attach set to venipuncture device .
If device is not indwelling , prime and make venipuncture .
• Regulate rate of administration with flow control clamp .
WARNING : Do not use flexible container in series connections .
Do not add supplementary medication .
Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is completed .
