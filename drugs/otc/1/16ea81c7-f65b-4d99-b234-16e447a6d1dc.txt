DESCRIPTION Indium In 111 Chloride Sterile Solution is indicated for radiolabeling ProstaScint ™ preparations used for in vivo diagnostic imaging procedures .
It is also indicated for radiolabeling Zevalin ™ preparations used for Radioimmunotherapy procedures .
It is supplied as a sterile , non - pyrogenic solution of Indium In 111 Chloride in 0 . 05 molar hydrochloric acid .
No carrier has been added to the solution .
Each 0 . 5 milliliter of the solution contains 185 megabequerels ( 5 millicuries ) of Indium In 111 Chloride at time of calibration ( specific activity of > 1 . 85 GBq / μg Indium ; > 50 mCi / μg Indium at this time of calibration ) .
The solution pH is 1 . 1 to 1 . 4 .
Radionuclidic Purity Indium In - 111 is cyclotron produced by the proton irradiation ( ( p , 2 n ) reaction ) of cadmium Cd - 112 enriched target .
At time of calibration , it contains not less than 99 . 925 % indium In - 111 and , not more than 0 . 075 % indium In - 114 m and zinc Zn - 65 combined .
At the time of expiration , it contains not less than 99 . 85 % indium 111 and not more than 0 . 15 % indium In - 114 m and zinc Zn - 65 combined .
No carrier has been added .
Radiochemical Purity At the time of calibration , the Indium In 111 Chloride Sterile Solution contains not less than 95 % of the Indium present as ionic In3 + .
Chemical Purity Indium In 111 Chloride Sterile Solution is tested for the following metallic impurities : copper , iron , cadmium , lead , zinc , nickel , and mercury , and contains extremely low levels of these metals .
The sum of the individual impurity ratios for the metals listed is not more than 0 . 60 ppm .
Physical Characteristics Indium In - 111 decays by electron capture to cadmium Cd - 111 ( stable ) with a physical half - life of 67 . 32 hours ( 2 . 81 days ) ( see Table 2 ) [ 1 ] .
Photons useful for detection and imaging are listed in Table 1 .

External Radiation The exposure rate constant for 37 MBq ( 1 mCi ) of indium In - 111 is 8 . 3 x 10 - 4 C / kg / hr ( 3 . 21 R / hr ) at 1 cm .
The specific gamma ray constant for indium In - 111 is 3 . 21 R / hr - mCi @ 1 cm null .
The first half - value thickness of lead ( Pb ) is 0 . 023 cm .
A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 2 .
For example , the use of 0 . 834 cm of Pb will decrease the external radiation exposure by a factor of about 1000 .
