7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A inducers : Avoid concomitant use with NINLARO .
( 7 . 1 , 12 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Strong CYP3A Inducers Avoid concomitant administration of NINLARO with strong CYP3A inducers ( such as rifampin , phenytoin , carbamazepine , and St . John ' s Wort ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Hepatic Impairment : Reduce the NINLARO starting dose to 3 mg in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment .
( 2 . 3 , 8 . 6 ) • Renal Impairment : Reduce the NINLARO starting dose to 3 mg in patients with severe renal impairment or end - stage renal disease requiring dialysis .
( 2 . 4 , 8 . 7 ) • Lactation : Discontinue nursing .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Women should avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with NINLARO .
Risk Summary NINLARO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no human data available regarding the potential effect of NINLARO on pregnancy or development of the embryo or fetus .
Ixazomib caused embryo - fetal toxicity in pregnant rats and rabbits at doses resulting in exposures that were slightly higher then those observed in patients receiving the recommended dose [ see Data ] .
Advise women of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with NINLARO .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In an embryo - fetal development study in pregnant rabbits there were increases in fetal skeletal variations / abnormalities ( fused caudal vertebrae , number of lumbar vertebrae , and full supernumerary ribs ) at doses that were also maternally toxic ( ≥ 0 . 3 mg / kg ) .
Exposures in the rabbit at 0 . 3 mg / kg were 1 . 9 times the clinical time averaged exposures at the recommended dose of 4 mg .
In a rat dose range - finding embryo - fetal development study , at doses that were maternally toxic , there were decreases in fetal weights , a trend towards decreased fetal viability , and increased post - implantation losses at 0 . 6 mg / kg .
Exposures in rats at the dose of 0 . 6 mg / kg was 2 . 5 times the clinical time averaged exposures at the recommended dose of 4 mg .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether NINLARO or its metabolites are present in human milk .
Many drugs are present in human milk and as a result , there could be a potential for adverse events in nursing infants .
Advise women to discontinue nursing .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Male and female patients of childbearing potential must use effective contraceptive measures during and for 90 days following treatment .
Infertility Fertility studies were not conducted with NINLARO ; however there were no effects on reproductive organs in either males or females in nonclinical studies in rats and dogs [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of NINLARO , 55 % were 65 and over , while 17 % were 75 and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment , the mean AUC increased by 20 % when compared to patients with normal hepatic function .
Reduce the starting dose of NINLARO in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD requiring dialysis , the mean AUC increased by 39 % when compared to patients with normal renal function .
Reduce the starting dose of NINLARO in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD requiring dialysis .
NINLARO is not dialyzable and therefore can be administered without regard to the timing of dialysis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known specific antidote for NINLARO overdose .
In the event of an overdose , monitor the patient for adverse reactions [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] and provide appropriate supportive care .
11 DESCRIPTION NINLARO ( ixazomib ) is an antineoplastic agent .
Ixazomib citrate , a prodrug , rapidly hydrolyzes under physiological conditions to its biologically active form , ixazomib .
The chemical name of ixazomib citrate is 1 , 3 , 2 - dioxaborolane - 4 , 4 - diacetic acid , 2 - [ ( 1 R ) - 1 - [ [ 2 - [ ( 2 , 5 - dichlorobenzoyl ) amino ] acetyl ] amino ] - 3 - methylbutyl ] - 5 - oxo - and the structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The molecular formula for ixazomib citrate is C20H23BCl2N2O9 and its molecular weight is 517 . 12 .

The solubility of ixazomib citrate in 0 . 1 N HCl ( pH 1 . 2 ) at 37 ° C is 0 . 61 mg / mL ( reported as ixazomib ) .
The solubility increases as the pH increases .
NINLARO ( ixazomib ) capsules for oral use contain 4 , 3 or 2 . 3 mg of ixazomib equivalent to 5 . 7 , 4 . 3 or 3 . 3 mg of ixazomib citrate , respectively .
Inactive ingredients include microcrystalline cellulose , magnesium stearate , and talc .
Capsule shells contain gelatin and titanium dioxide .

The printing ink contains shellac , propylene glycol , potassium hydroxide , and black iron oxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Ixazomib is a reversible proteasome inhibitor .
Ixazomib preferentially binds and inhibits the chymotrypsin - like activity of the beta 5 subunit of the 20 S proteasome .
Ixazomib induced apoptosis of multiple myeloma cell lines in vitro .
Ixazomib demonstrated in vitro cytotoxicity against myeloma cells from patients who had relapsed after multiple prior therapies , including bortezomib , lenalidomide , and dexamethasone .
The combination of ixazomib and lenalidomide demonstrated synergistic cytotoxic effects in multiple myeloma cell lines .
In vivo , ixazomib demonstrated antitumor activity in a mouse multiple myeloma tumor xenograft model .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology NINLARO did not prolong the QTc interval at clinically relevant exposures based on pharmacokinetic - pharmacodynamic analysis of data from 245 patients .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration , the median time to achieve peak ixazomib plasma concentrations was one hour .
The mean absolute oral bioavailability was 58 % , based on population PK analysis .
Ixazomib AUC increases in a dose proportional manner over a dose range of 0 . 2 to 10 . 6 mg .
A food effect study conducted in patients with a single 4 mg dose of ixazomib showed that a high - fat meal decreased ixazomib AUC by 28 % and Cmax by 69 % [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Distribution Ixazomib is 99 % bound to plasma proteins and distributes into red blood cells with a blood - to - plasma ratio of 10 .
The steady - state volume of distribution is 543 L . Elimination Based on a population PK analysis , systemic clearance was approximately 1 . 9 L / hr with inter - individual variability of 44 % .
The terminal half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of ixazomib was 9 . 5 days .
Following weekly oral dosing , the accumulation ratio was determined to be 2 - fold .
Metabolism After oral administration of a radiolabeled dose , ixazomib represented 70 % of total drug - related material in plasma .
Metabolism by multiple CYP enzymes and non - CYP proteins is expected to be the major clearance mechanism for ixazomib .
At clinically relevant ixazomib concentrations , in vitro studies using human cDNA - expressed cytochrome P450 isozymes showed that no specific CYP isozyme predominantly contributes to ixazomib metabolism .
At higher than clinical concentrations , ixazomib was metabolized by multiple CYP isoforms with estimated relative contributions of 3A4 ( 42 % ) , 1A2 ( 26 % ) , 2B6 ( 16 % ) , 2C8 ( 6 % ) , 2D6 ( 5 % ) , 2C19 ( 5 % ) and 2C9 ( < 1 % ) .
Excretion After administration of a single oral dose of 14 C - ixazomib to 5 patients with advanced cancer , 62 % of the administered radioactivity was excreted in urine and 22 % in the feces .
Unchanged ixazomib accounted for < 3 . 5 % of the administered dose recovered in urine .
Specific Populations Age , Sex , Race There was no clinically meaningful effect of age ( range 23 - 91 years ) , sex , body surface area ( range 1 . 2 - 2 . 7 m2 ) , or race on the clearance of ixazomib based on population PK analysis .
Hepatic Impairment The PK of ixazomib was similar in patients with normal hepatic function and in patients with mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin > 1 - 1 . 5 × ULN and any AST ) based on population PK analysis .
The PK of ixazomib was characterized in patients with normal hepatic function at 4 mg ( N = 12 ) , moderate hepatic impairment at 2 . 3 mg ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 - 3 × ULN , N = 13 ) or severe hepatic impairment at 1 . 5 mg ( total bilirubin > 3 × ULN , N = 18 ) .
Dose - normalized mean AUC was 20 % higher in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment as compared to patients with normal hepatic function [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Renal Impairment The PK of ixazomib was similar in patients with normal renal function and in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL / min ) based on population PK analysis .
The PK of ixazomib was characterized at a dose of 3 mg in patients with normal renal function ( creatinine clearance ≥ 90 mL / min , N = 18 ) , severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min , N = 14 ) , or ESRD requiring dialysis ( N = 6 ) .
Mean AUC was 39 % higher in patients with severe renal impairment or ESRD requiring dialysis as compared to patients with normal renal function .
Pre - and post - dialyzer concentrations of ixazomib measured during the hemodialysis session were similar , suggesting that ixazomib is not dialyzable [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Drug Interactions Effect of Other Drugs on NINLARO Strong CYP3A Inducers Co - administration of NINLARO with rifampin decreased ixazomib Cmax by 54 % and AUC by 74 % [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Co - administration of NINLARO with clarithromycin did not result in a clinically meaningful change in the systemic exposure of ixazomib .
Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors Co - administration of NINLARO with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors did not result in a clinically meaningful change in the systemic exposure of ixazomib based on a population PK analysis .
Effect of NINLARO on Other Drugs Ixazomib is neither a reversible nor a time - dependent inhibitor of CYPs 1A2 , 2B6 , 2C8 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , or 3A4 / 5 .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Ixazomib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay ( Ames assay ) .
Ixazomib was considered positive in an in vitro clastogenicity test in human peripheral blood lymphocytes .
However , in vivo , ixazomib was not clastogenic in a bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice and was negative in an in vivo comet assay in mice , as assessed in the stomach and liver .
No carcinogenicity studies have been performed with ixazomib .
Developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits did not show direct embryo - fetal toxicity below maternally toxic doses of ixazomib .
Studies of fertility and early embryonic development and pre - and postnatal toxicology were not conducted with ixazomib , but evaluation of reproductive tissues was conducted in the general toxicity studies .
There were no effects due to ixazomib treatment on male or female reproductive organs in studies up to 6 - months duration in rats and up to 9 - months duration in dogs .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy and safety of NINLARO in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone was evaluated in a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , multicenter study in patients with relapsed and / or refractory multiple myeloma who had received at least one prior line of therapy .
Patients who were refractory to lenalidomide or proteasome inhibitors were excluded from the study .
A total of 722 patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive either the combination of NINLARO , lenalidomide and dexamethasone ( N = 360 ; NINLARO regimen ) or the combination of placebo , lenalidomide and dexamethasone ( N = 362 ; placebo regimen ) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Randomization was stratified according to number of prior lines of therapy ( 1 versus 2 or 3 ) , myeloma International Staging System ( ISS ) ( stage I or II versus III ) , and previous therapy with a proteasome inhibitor ( exposed or naïve ) .
Twenty three percent ( N = 166 ) of the patients had light chain disease and 12 % ( N = 87 ) of patients had free light chain - measurable only disease .
Thromboprophylaxis was recommended for all patients in both treatment groups according to the lenalidomide prescribing information .
Antiemetics were used in 19 % of patients in the NINLARO regimen and 12 % of patients in the placebo regimen ; antivirals in 64 % and 60 % , respectively , and antihistamines in 27 % and 19 % , respectively .
These medications were given to patients at the physician ' s discretion as prophylaxis and / or management of symptoms .
Patients received NINLARO 4 mg or placebo on Days 1 , 8 , and 15 plus lenalidomide ( 25 mg ) on Days 1 through 21 and dexamethasone ( 40 mg ) on Days 1 , 8 , 15 , and 22 of a 28 - day cycle .
Patients with renal impairment received a starting dose of lenalidomide according to its prescribing information .
Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities .
Table 6 summarizes the baseline patient and disease characteristics in the study .
The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced and comparable between the study regimens .

The efficacy of NINLARO was evaluated by progression - free survival ( PFS ) according to the 2011 International Myeloma Working Group ( IMWG ) Consensus Uniform Response Criteria as assessed by a blinded independent review committee ( IRC ) based on central lab results .
Response was assessed every four weeks until disease progression .
The approval of NINLARO was based upon a statistically significant improvement in PFS of the NINLARO regimen compared to the placebo regimen .
PFS results are summarized in Table 7 and shown in Figure 1 .

A hazard ratio less than 1 indicates an advantage for the NINLARO regimen .
[ 2 ] P - value is based on the stratified log - rank test .
The median time to response was 1 . 1 months in the NINLARO regimen and 1 . 9 months in the placebo regimen .
The median duration of response was 20 . 5 months in the NINLARO regimen and 15 months in the placebo regimen for responders in the response evaluable population .
Figure 1 : Kaplan - Meier Plot of Progression - Free Survival [ MULTIMEDIA ] A non - inferential PFS analysis was conducted at a median follow up of 23 months with 372 PFS events .
Hazard ratio of PFS was 0 . 82 ( 95 % confidence interval [ 0 . 67 , 1 . 0 ] ) for NINLARO regimen versus placebo regimen , and estimated median PFS was 20 months in the NINLARO regimen and 15 . 9 months in the placebo regimen .
At the same time , a planned interim OS analysis was conducted with 35 % of the required number of deaths for final OS analysis ; there were 81 deaths in the NINLARO regimen and 90 deaths in the placebo regimen .
An OS benefit was not demonstrated .
