Concurrent administration of vinorelbine with a CYP3A inhibitor may cause an earlier onset and / or an increased severity of adverse reactions .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed ( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] , Vinorelbine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Available human data are insufficient to inform the drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies in mice and rabbits , embryo and fetal toxicity were observed with administration of vinorelbine at doses approximately 0 . 33 and 0 . 18 times the human therapeutic dose , respectively ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In a mouse embryo - fetal development study , administration of a single dose of vinorelbine at a dose level of 9 mg / m2 or greater ( approximately 0 . 33 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) was embryotoxic and fetotoxic .
Vinorelbine was embryotoxic and fetotoxic to pregnant rabbits when administered every 6 days during the period of organogenesis at doses of 5 . 5 mg / m2 ( approximately 0 . 18 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) or greater .
At doses that did not cause maternal toxicity in either species , vinorelbine administration resulted in reduced fetal weight and delayed ossification .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of vinorelbine in human milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from vinorelbine , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with vinorelbine and for 9 days after the final dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating vinorelbine [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception Females Vinorelbine can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with vinorelbine and for 6 months after the final dose .
Males Vinorelbine may damage spermatozoa [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Advise males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with vinorelbine and for 3 months after the final dose .
Infertility Males Based on animal findings , vinorelbine may impair fertility in males [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of vinorelbine in pediatric patients have not been established .
Results from a single - arm study of vinorelbine administered at the dose of 33 . 75 mg / m2 ( for 35 patients ) or at the dose of 30 mg / m2 ( for 11 patients ) every week for 6 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest were evaluated ( courses of 8 weeks ) .
Forty - six patients age 1 to 25 ( median 11 years ) with recurrent solid malignant tumors , including rhabdomyosarcoma or undifferentiated sarcoma ( N = 21 patients ) , neuroblastoma ( N = 4 patients ) and central nervous system ( CNS ) tumors ( N = 21 patients ) , were enrolled .
The most significant grade 3 or 4 hematological adverse reactions were neutropenia ( 70 % ) and anemia ( 33 % ) .
The most significant grade 3 or 4 non - hematological adverse reactions were motor ( 15 % ) or cranial ( 13 % ) neuropathy , hypoxia ( 13 % ) and dyspnea ( 11 % ) .
Objective tumor response was observed in 2 out of 21 patients with rhabdomyosarcoma or undifferentiated sarcoma .
No objective tumor response was observed in patients with CNS tumors ( N = 21 ) or neuroblastoma ( N = 4 ) .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 769 number of patients who received vinorelbine as a single agent and in combination with cisplatin in studies 1 , 2 and 3 , 247 patients were 65 years of age or older .
No overall differences in safety , efficacy and pharmacokinetic parameters were observed between these patients and younger patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment The influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine has not been evaluated , but the liver plays an important role in the metabolism of vinorelbine .
Elevated AST occur in > 60 % of the patients receiving vinorelbine as a single agent ( 6 % Grade 3 to 4 ) .
Therefore , exercise caution in patients with hepatic impairment .
Reduce the dose of vinorelbine for patients with elevated serum total bilirubin concentrations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known antidote for overdoses of vinorelbine .
Overdoses involving quantities up to 10 times the recommended dose ( 30 mg / m2 ) have been reported .
The adverse reactions described were consistent with those listed in the ADVERSE REACTIONS section , including paralytic ileus , stomatitis and esophagitis .
Bone marrow aplasia , sepsis and paresis have also been reported .
Fatalities have occurred following overdose of vinorelbine .
If overdosage occurs , general supportive measures together with appropriate blood transfusions , growth factors and antibiotics should be instituted as deemed necessary by the physician .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Vinorelbine is a vinca alkaloid that interferes with microtubule assembly .
The antitumor activity of vinorelbine is thought to be due primarily to inhibition of mitosis at metaphase through its interaction with tubulin .
Vinorelbine may also interfere with : 1 ) amino acid , cyclic AMP and glutathione metabolism , 2 ) calmodulin - dependent Ca + + - transport ATPase activity , 3 ) cellular respiration , and 4 ) nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis .
Vinorelbine inhibited mitotic microtubule formation in intact mouse embryo tectal plates at a concentration of 2 µM inducing a blockade of cells at metaphase , but produced depolymerization of axonal microtubules at a concentration 40 µM , suggesting a modest selectivity of vinorelbine for mitotic microtubules .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine were studied in 49 patients who received doses of 30 mg / m2 administered as 15 - to 20 - minute constant - rate infusions .
Vinorelbine concentrations in plasma decay in a triphasic manner .
Distribution Steady - state volume of distribution ( VSS ) values range from 25 . 4 to 40 . 1 L / kg .
Vinorelbine demonstrated high binding to human platelets and lymphocytes .
The free fraction was approximately 0 . 11 in human plasma over a concentration range of 234 to 1169 ng / mL .
The binding to plasma constituents in cancer patients ranged from 79 . 6 % to 91 . 2 % .
Vinorelbine binding was not altered in the presence of cisplatin , fluorouracil , or doxorubicin .
Elimination The terminal phase half - life averages 27 . 7 to 43 . 6 hours and the mean plasma clearance ranges from 0 . 97 to 1 . 26 L / hr / kg .
Metabolism Vinorelbine undergoes substantial hepatic elimination in humans , with large amounts recovered in feces .
Two metabolites of vinorelbine have been identified in human blood , plasma and urine ; vinorelbine N - oxide and deacetylvinorelbine .
Deacetylvinorelbine has been demonstrated to be the primary metabolite of vinorelbine in humans and has been shown to possess antitumor activity similar to vinorelbine .
Therapeutic doses of vinorelbine ( 30 mg / m2 ) yield very small , if any , quantifiable levels of either metabolite in blood or urine .
The metabolism of vinorelbine is mediated by hepatic CYP3A .
Excretion After intravenous administration of radioactive vinorelbine , approximately 18 % and 46 % of administered radioactivity was recovered in urine and feces , respectively .
In a different study , 10 . 9 % ± 0 . 7 % of a 30 mg / m2 intravenous dose was excreted as parent drug in urine .
Specific Populations Age has no effect on the pharmacokinetics ( CL , VSS and t1 / 2 ) of vinorelbine .
Drug Interaction Studies The pharmacokinetics of vinorelbine are not influenced by the concurrent administration of cisplatin .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of vinorelbine has not been studied .
Vinorelbine has been shown to affect chromosome number and possibly structure in vivo ( polyploidy in bone marrow cells from Chinese hamsters and a positive micronucleus test in mice ) .
It was not mutagenic in the Ames test and gave inconclusive results in the mouse lymphoma TK Locus assay .
Vinorelbine did not affect fertility to a statistically significant extent when administered to rats on either a once - weekly ( 9 mg / m2 , approximately one third the human dose ) or alternate - day schedule ( 4 . 2 mg / m2 , approximately 0 . 14 times the human recommended dose ) prior to and during mating .
In male rats , administration of vinorelbine twice weekly for 13 or 26 weeks at dose levels of 2 . 1 and 7 . 2 mg / m2 ( approximately 0 . 07 and 0 . 24 times the recommended human dose ) , respectively , resulted in decreased spermatogenesis and prostate / seminal vesicle secretion .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Combination Use with Cisplatin The safety and efficacy of vinorelbine in combination with cisplatin was evaluated in two randomized , multicenter trials .
Cisplatin 100 mg / m2 Study 1 was a randomized , multicenter , open - label trial of vinorelbine plus cisplatin and cisplatin alone for the treatment of stage IV or stage IIIb NSCLC in patients with malignant pleural effusion or multiple lesions in more than one lobe of the ipsilateral lung who had not received prior chemotherapy .
A total of 432 patients were randomized 1 : 1 to receive either vinorelbine 25 mg / m2 on Day 1 then every week of each 28 - day cycle plus cisplatin 100 mg / m2 administered on Day 1 of each 28 - day cycle ( N = 214 ) or single agent cisplatin 100 mg / m2 on Day 1 of each 28 - day cycle ( N = 218 ) .
Patient demographics and disease characteristics were similar between arms .
Of the overall study population , the median age was 64 ( range 33 to 84 ) , 66 % were male , 80 % were White , 92 % had stage IV disease and 8 % stage IIIB , 53 % had adenocarcinoma , 21 % squamous cell , 14 % large cell histology .
The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival .
The efficacy results are presented in Table 7 and Figure 1 .

The study was conducted in Europe .
A total of 612 patients were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to receive vinorelbine 30 mg / m2 every week of a 6 - week cycle plus cisplatin 120 mg / m2 on Day 1 and Day 29 , then every 6 weeks thereafter ( N = 206 ) ; and vindesine 3 mg / m2 for 6 weeks , then every other week thereafter plus cisplatin 120 mg / m2 on Days 1 and Day 29 , then every 6 weeks thereafter ( N = 200 ) or vinorelbine 30 mg / m2 every week of a 6 - week cycle ( N = 206 ) .
The main efficacy outcome measure was to compare overall survival between vinorelbine plus cisplatin and vindesine plus cisplatin .
The other efficacy outcome measure was to compare overall survival in the better of the two combination regimens to that of vinorelbine as a single agent .
Patient demographics were in general similar between arms : the median age of the overall population was 60 years ( range 30 to 75 ) , 90 % were male , 78 % had WHO performance status of 0 or 1 .
Tumor characteristics were in general similar with the exception of histologic subtype of NSCLC .
Adenocarcinoma was the histologic subtype in 32 % of patients in the vinorelbine plus cisplatin arm , 40 % of patients in vindesine plus cisplatin arm and 28 % of patients on the vinorelbine arm .
Ten percent of the patients had stage IIIA disease , 28 % stage IIIB and 50 % stage IV .
Twelve percent of the patients had received prior surgery or radiotherapy .

Study 3 was a randomized , open - label clinical trial of vinorelbine or fluorouracil ( FU ) plus leucovorin ( LV ) in patients with Stage IV NSCLC who had not received prior chemotherapy A total of 211 patients were randomized 2 : 1 to receive vinorelbine 30 mg / m2 weekly of an 8 - week cycle ( N = 143 ) or FU 425 mg / m2 bolus intravenously plus LV 20 mg / m2 bolus intravenously daily for 5 days of a 4 - weeks cycle ( N = 68 ) .
Patient demographics and disease characteristics were in general similar between arms .
In the overall population , the median age was 61 years ( range 32 to 83 ) , 74 % were male , 88 % were White , 46 % had adenocarcinoma histology .
Fifty percent of the patients had Karnofsky performance status ≥ 90 in the vinorelbine arm compared to 38 % in the FU / LV arm .
The primary efficacy outcome of the study was overall survival .
The median survival time was 30 weeks versus 22 weeks for patients receiving vinorelbine versus FU / LV , respectively ( p = 0 . 06 ) .
Partial objective responses were observed in 11 . 1 % ( 95 % CI = 6 . 2 % , 17 . 9 % ) and 3 . 5 % ( 95 % CI = 0 . 4 % , 11 . 9 % ) of patients who received vinorelbine and FU / LV , respectively .
