6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The data in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to romidepsin in four clinical trials involving 363 patients with T - cell lymphoma , including 185 patients with CTCL .
Romidepsin was administered as a single agent at a dosage of 14 mg / m2 on days 1 , 8 , and 15 of a 28 - day cycle .
Among 363 patients who received romidepsin , 21 % were exposed for 6 months or longer and 13 % were exposed for greater than one year .
Cutaneous T - Cell Lymphoma The safety of romidepsin was evaluated in 185 patients with CTCL in 2 single arm clinical studies in which patients received a dosage of 14 mg / m2 on days 1 , 8 , and 15 of a 28 - day cycle .
Treatment continued as long as the patient benefitted from and tolerated the drug .
The mean duration of treatment in these studies was 5 . 6 months ( range : < 1 to 83 . 4 months ) .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Warfarin : Carefully monitor prothrombin time ( PT ) and International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) in patients receiving concurrent warfarin or coumarin derivatives ( 7 . 1 ) .
• CYP3A4 inhibitors : Monitor for toxicities related to increased romidepsin exposure when coadministering romidepsin with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ( 7 . 2 ) .
• CYP3A4 inducers : Avoid use with rifampin and strong CYP3A4 inducers ( 7 . 3 ) .
7 . 1 Warfarin or Coumarin Derivatives Prolongation of PT and elevation of INR were observed in a patient receiving romidepsin concomitantly with warfarin .
Monitor PT and INR more frequently in patients concurrently receiving Romidepsin Injection and warfarin [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Drugs That Inhibit CYP3A4 Enzymes Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increase concentrations of romidepsin [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Monitor for toxicity related to increased romidepsin exposure and follow the dose modifications for toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] when Romidepsin Injection is initially coadministered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors .
7 . 3 Drugs That Induce CYP3A4 Enzymes Rifampin ( a potent CYP3A4 inducer ) increased the concentrations of romidepsin [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Avoid coadministration of Romidepsin Injection with rifampin .
The use of other potent CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided when possible .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies , Romidepsin Injection can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data on romidepsin use in pregnant women to inform a drug associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage .
In an animal reproductive study , romidepsin was embryocidal and caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo - fetal toxicity and malformations at exposures below those in patients at the recommended dose ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus and to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving romidepsin and for at least 1 month after the last dose .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Romidepsin was administered intravenously to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 0 . 1 , 0 . 2 , or 0 . 5 mg / kg / day .
Substantial resorption or postimplantation loss was observed at the high dose of 0 . 5 mg / kg / day , a maternally toxic dose .
Adverse embryo - fetal effects were noted at romidepsin doses of ≥ 0 . 1 mg / kg / day , with systemic exposures ( AUC ) ≥ 0 . 2 % of the human exposure at the recommended dose of 14 mg / m2 / week .
Drug - related fetal effects consisted of reduced fetal body weights , folded retina , rotated limbs , and incomplete sternal ossification .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of romidepsin or its metabolites in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child , advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with Romidepsin Injection and for 1 week after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Romidepsin Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Perform pregnancy testing in females of reproductive potential within 7 days prior to initiating therapy with Romidepsin Injection .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Romidepsin Injection and for 1 month after the last dose .
Romidepsin may reduce the effectiveness of estrogen - containing contraceptives .
Therefore , alternative methods of non - estrogen containing contraception ( e . g . , condoms , intrauterine devices ) should be used in patients receiving Romidepsin Injection .
Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Romidepsin Injection and for 1 month after the last dose .
Infertility Based on findings in animals , romidepsin has the potential to affect male and female fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Romidepsin Injection in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 186 patients with CTCL who received romidepsin in clinical studies , 51 ( 28 % ) were 65 years of age and older , while 16 ( 9 % ) were 75 years of age .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years or age and over and younger patients ; however , greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment In a hepatic impairment study , romidepsin was evaluated in 19 patients with advanced cancer and mild ( 8 ) , moderate ( 5 ) , or severe ( 6 ) hepatic impairment .
There were 4 deaths during the first cycle of treatment : 1 patient with mild hepatic impairment , 1 patient with moderate hepatic impairment , and 2 patients with severe hepatic impairment .
No dose adjustments are recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment .
Reduce the Romidepsin Injection starting dose for patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Monitor patients with hepatic impairment more frequently for toxicity , especially during the first cycle of therapy .
10 OVERDOSAGE No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage of romidepsin .
Toxicities in a single - dose study in rats or dogs , at intravenous romidepsin doses up to 2 . 2 - fold the recommended human dose based on the body surface area , included irregular respiration , irregular heartbeat , staggering gait , tremor , and tonic convulsions .
In the event of an overdose , it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures , e . g . , clinical monitoring and supportive therapy , if required .
There is no known antidote for romidepsin and it is not known if romidepsin is dialyzable .
11 DESCRIPTION Romidepsin , a histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor , is a bicyclic depsipeptide .
At room temperature , romidepsin is a white to off - white solid and is described chemically as ( 1 S , 4 S , 7 Z , 10 S , 16 E , 21 R ) - 7 - ethylidene - 4 , 21 - bis ( 1 - methylethyl ) - 2 - oxa - 12 , 13 - dithia - 5 , 8 , 20 , 23 - tetraazabicyclo [ 8 . 7 . 6 ] tricos - 16 - ene - 3 , 6 , 9 , 19 , 22 - pentone .
The molecular formula is C24H36N4O6S2 • CH4O .
The molecular weight is 572 . 74 and the structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Romidepsin Injection is intended for intravenous infusion only after dilution with 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride , USP .
Romidepsin Injection is a sterile , clear , colorless to pale yellow solution and is supplied in single - dose vials .
Each mL contains romidepsin 5 mg , povidone 10 mg , DL - alpha - tocopherol 0 . 05 mg , dehydrated alcohol 157 . 8 mg ( 20 . 1 % v / v ) , and propylene glycol 828 . 8 mg .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Romidepsin is a histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor .
HDACs catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from acetylated lysine residues in histones , resulting in the modulation of gene expression .
HDACs also deacetylate non - histone proteins , such as transcription factors .
In vitro , romidepsin causes the accumulation of acetylated histones , and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of some cancer cell lines with IC50 values in the nanomolar range .
The mechanism of the antineoplastic effect of romidepsin observed in nonclinical and clinical studies has not been fully characterized .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology At doses of 14 mg / m2 as a 4 - hour intravenous infusion and at doses of 8 ( 0 . 57 times the recommended dose ) , 10 ( 0 . 71 times the recommended dose ) or 12 ( 0 . 86 times the recommended dose ) mg / m2 as a 1 - hour infusion , no large changes in the mean QTc interval ( > 20 milliseconds ) from baseline based on Fridericia correction method were detected .
Small increase in mean QT interval ( < 10 milliseconds ) and mean QT interval increase between 10 to 20 milliseconds cannot be excluded .
Romidepsin was associated with a delayed concentration - dependent increase in heart rate in patients with advanced cancer with a maximum mean increase in heart rate of 20 beats per minute occurring at the 6 - hour time point after start of romidepsin infusion for patients receiving 14 mg / m2 as a 4 - hour infusion .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In patients with T - cell lymphomas who received 14 mg / m2 of romidepsin intravenously over a 4 - hour period on days 1 , 8 , and 15 of a 28 - day cycle , geometric mean values of the maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) and the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve ( AUC0 - ∞ ) were 377 ng / mL and 1549 ng * hr / mL , respectively .
Romidepsin exhibited linear pharmacokinetics across doses ranging from 1 . 0 ( 0 . 07 times the recommended dose ) to 24 . 9 ( 1 . 76 times the recommended dose ) mg / m2 when administered intravenously over 4 hours in patients with advanced cancers .
Distribution Romidepsin is highly protein bound in plasma ( 92 % to 94 % ) over the concentration range of 50 ng / mL to 1000 ng / mL with α1 - acid - glycoprotein ( AAG ) being the principal binding protein .
Romidepsin is a substrate of the efflux transporter P - glycoprotein ( P - gp , ABCB1 ) .
In vitro , romidepsin accumulates into human hepatocytes via an unknown active uptake process .
Romidepsin is not a substrate of the following uptake transporters : BCRP , BSEP , MRP2 , OAT1 , OAT3 , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , or OCT2 .
In addition , romidepsin is not an inhibitor of BCRP , MRP2 , MDR1 or OAT3 .
Although romidepsin did not inhibit OAT1 , OCT2 , and OATP1B3 at concentrations seen clinically ( 1 μmol / L ) , modest inhibition was observed at 10 μmol / L . Romidepsin was found to be an inhibitor of BSEP and OATP1B1 .
Metabolism Romidepsin undergoes extensive metabolism in vitro primarily by CYP3A4 with minor contribution from CYP3A5 , CYP1A1 , CYP2B6 , and CYP2C19 .
At therapeutic concentrations , romidepsin did not competitively inhibit CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 , or CYP3A4 in vitro .
At therapeutic concentrations , romidepsin did not cause notable induction of CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 in vitro .
Therefore , pharmacokinetic drug - drug interactions are unlikely to occur due to CYP450 induction or inhibition by romidepsin when coadministered with CYP450 substrates .
Excretion Following 4 - hour intravenous administration of romidepsin at 14 mg / m2 on days 1 , 8 , and 15 of a 28 - day cycle in patients with T - cell lymphomas , the terminal half - life ( t1 / 2 ) was approximately 3 hours .
No accumulation of plasma concentration of romidepsin was observed after repeated dosing .
Drug Interactions Ketoconazole Following coadministration of 8 mg / m2 romidepsin ( 4 - hour infusion ) with ketoconazole , the overall romidepsin exposure was increased by approximately 25 % and 10 % for AUC0 - ∞ and Cmax , respectively , compared to romidepsin alone , and the difference in AUC0 - ∞ between the 2 treatments was statistically significant .
Rifampin Following coadministration of 14 mg / m2 romidepsin ( 4 - hour infusion ) with rifampin , the overall romidepsin exposure was increased by approximately 80 % and 60 % for AUC0 - ∞ and Cmax , respectively , compared to romidepsin alone , and the difference between the 2 treatments was statistically significant .
Coadministration of rifampin decreased the romidepsin clearance and volume of distribution by 44 % and 52 % , respectively .
The increase in exposure seen after coadministration with rifampin is likely due to rifampin ’ s inhibition of an undetermined hepatic uptake process that is predominant for the disposition of romidepsin .
Drugs that inhibit P - glycoprotein Drugs that inhibit p - glycoprotein may increase the concentration of romidepsin .
Specific Populations Effect of Age , Gender , Race or Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of romidepsin was not influenced by age ( 27 to 83 yrs ) , gender , race ( white vs . black ) or mild ( estimated creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL / min ) , moderate ( estimated creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL / min ) , or severe ( estimated creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min ) renal impairment .
The effect of end - stage renal disease ( estimated creatine clearance less than 15 mL / min ) on romidepsin pharmacokinetics has not been studied .
Hepatic Impairment Romidepsin clearance decreased with increased severity of hepatic impairment .
In patients with cancer , the geometric mean Cmax values after administration of 14 , 7 , and 5 mg / m2 romidepsin in patients with mild ( B1 : bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN ; B2 : bilirubin > ULN but ≤ 1 . 5 x ULN and any AST ) , moderate ( bilirubin > 1 . 5 x ULN to ≤ 3 x ULN and any AST ) , and severe ( bilirubin > 3 x ULN and any AST ) hepatic impairment were approximately 111 % , 96 % , and 86 % of the corresponding value after administration of 14 mg / m2 romidepsin in patients with normal ( bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal ( ULN ) and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ ULN ) hepatic function , respectively .
The geometric mean AUCinf values in patients with mild , moderate , and severe hepatic impairment were approximately 144 % , 114 % , and 116 % of the corresponding value in patients with normal hepatic function , respectively .
Among these 4 cohorts , moderate interpatient variability was noted for the exposure parameters Cmax and AUCinf , as the coefficient of variation ( CV ) ranged from 30 % to 54 % .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with romidepsin .
Romidepsin was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation assay ( Ames test ) or the mouse lymphoma assay .
Romidepsin was not clastogenic in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay when tested to the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of 1 mg / kg in males and 3 mg / kg in females ( 6 and 18 mg / m2 in males and females , respectively ) .
These doses were up to 1 . 3 - fold the recommended human dose , based on body surface area .
Based on nonclinical findings , male and female fertility may be compromised by treatment with romidepsin .
In a 26 - week toxicology study , romidepsin administration resulted in testicular degeneration in rats at 0 . 33 mg / kg / dose ( 2 mg / m2 / dose ) following the clinical dosing schedule .
This dose resulted in AUC0 - ∞ values that were approximately 2 % the exposure level in patients receiving the recommended dose of 14 mg / m2 / dose .
A similar effect was seen in mice after 4 weeks of drug administration at higher doses .
Seminal vesicle and prostate organ weights were decreased in a separate study in rats after 4 weeks of daily drug administration at 0 . 1 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 6 mg / m2 / day ) , approximately 30 % the estimated human daily dose based on body surface area .
Romidepsin showed high affinity for binding to estrogen receptors in pharmacology studies .
In a 26 - week toxicology study in rats , atrophy was seen in the ovary , uterus , vagina and mammary gland of females administered doses as low as 0 . 1 mg / kg / dose ( 0 . 6 mg / m2 / dose ) following the clinical dosing schedule .
This dose resulted in AUC0 - ∞ values that were 0 . 3 % of those in patients receiving the recommended dose of 14 mg / m2 / dose .
Maturation arrest of ovarian follicles and decreased weight of ovaries were observed in a separate study in rats after 4 weeks of daily drug administration at 0 . 1 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 6 mg / m2 / day ) .
This dose is approximately 30 % the estimated human daily dose based on body surface area .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Romidepsin was evaluated in 2 multicenter , single - arm clinical studies in patients with CTCL ( Study 1 [ NCT00106431 ] and Study 2 [ NCT00007345 ] ) .
Overall , 167 patients with CTCL were treated in the US , Europe , and Australia .
Study 1 included 96 patients with confirmed CTCL after failure of at least 1 prior systemic therapy .
Study 2 included 71 patients with a primary diagnosis of CTCL who received at least 2 prior skin directed therapies or one or more systemic therapies .
Patients were treated with romidepsin at a starting dose of 14 mg / m2 infused over 4 hours on days 1 , 8 , and 15 every 28 days .
In both studies , patients could be treated until disease progression at the discretion of the investigator and local regulators .
Objective disease response was evaluated according to a composite endpoint that included assessments of skin involvement , lymph node and visceral involvement , and abnormal circulating T - cells ( “ Sézary cells ” ) .
The primary efficacy endpoint for both studies was overall objective disease response rate ( ORR ) based on the investigator assessments , and was defined as the proportion of patients with confirmed complete response ( CR ) or partial response ( PR ) .
CR was defined as no evidence of disease and PR as ≥ 50 % improvement in disease .
Secondary endpoints in both studies included duration of response and time to response .
Baseline Patient Characteristics Demographic and disease characteristics of the patients in Study 1 and Study 2 are provided in Table 3 .
