Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery .
Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery , in women who are not breastfeeding .
( 5 . 1 ) • • Liver disease : Discontinue levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice occurs .
( 5 . 2 ) • • High blood pressure : If used in women with well - controlled hypertension , monitor blood pressure and stop levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets if blood pressure rises significantly .
( 5 . 4 ) • • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects : Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets .
Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia .
( 5 . 6 ) • • Headache : Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated .
( 5 . 7 ) • • Bleeding irregularities and amenorrhea : Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea .
( 5 . 8 ) 5 . 1 Thrombotic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems • • Stop levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thromboembolic ( VTE ) event occurs .
• • Stop levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets if there is unexplained loss of vision , proptosis , diplopia , papilledema , or retinal vascular lesions .
Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately .
• • If feasible , stop levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization .
• • Start levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery , in women who are not breastfeeding .
The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week , whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week .
• • The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE .
However , pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs .
The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10 , 000 woman - years .
The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer .
The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued .
• • Use of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets provides women with more hormonal exposure on a yearly basis than conventional monthly COCs containing the same strength synthetic estrogens and progestins ( an additional 9 weeks of exposure per year ) .
In the clinical trial , one case of pulmonary embolism was reported .
Postmarketing adverse reactions of VTE have been reported in women who used levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets .
• • Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions , especially in women with other risk factors for these events .
Stroke has been reported in women associated with the use of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets .
COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events ( thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes ) .
This risk increases with age , particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke .
• • Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors .
5 . 2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets in women with liver disease , such as acute viral hepatitis or severe ( decompensated ) cirrhosis of the liver [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded .
Discontinue levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets if jaundice develops .
Liver Tumors Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets are contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use .
An estimate of the attributable risk is 3 . 3 cases / 100 , 000 COC users .
Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra - abdominal hemorrhage .
Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long - term ( > 8 years ) COC users .
However , the attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users .
5 . 3 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains obmitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir , ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) , including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN , were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol - containing medications , such as COCs .
Discontinue levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen .
5 . 4 High Blood Pressure Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets are contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
For women with well - controlled hypertension , monitor blood pressure and stop levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets if blood pressure rises significantly .
An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs , and this increase is more likely in older women and with extended duration of use .
The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentration of progestin .
5 . 5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users .
Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease .
A past history of COC - related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use .
Women with a history of pregnancy related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC - related cholestasis .
5 . 6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who are taking levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets .
COCs may decrease glucose tolerance .
Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia .
A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs .
Women with hypertriglyceridemia , or a family history thereof , may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs .
5 . 7 Headache If a woman taking levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets develops new headaches that are recurrent , persistent , or severe , evaluate the cause and discontinue levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets if indicated .
Consider discontinuation of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use ( which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event ) [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
5 . 8 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Bleeding and / or spotting that occurs at any time while taking the first 84 tablets of each extended - cycle regimen is considered “ unscheduled ” bleeding / spotting .
Bleeding that occurs during the time a woman takes the seven green inert tablets is considered “ scheduled ” bleeding .
Unscheduled and Scheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled ( breakthrough ) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs , especially during the first 3 months of use .
If unscheduled bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles on levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets , check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy .
If pathology and pregnancy are excluded , bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different COC .
Before prescribing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets , advise the woman to weigh the convenience of fewer scheduled menses ( 4 per year instead of 13 per year ) against the inconvenience of increased unscheduled bleeding and / or spotting .
The clinical trial of the efficacy of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets ( 91 - day cycles ) in preventing pregnancy also assessed scheduled and unscheduled bleeding .
The participants in the study were composed primarily of women who had used oral contraceptives previously as opposed to new users .
Women with a history of breakthrough bleeding / spotting ≥ 10 consecutive days on oral contraceptives were excluded from the study .
More levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets subjects , compared to subjects on the comparator 28 - day cycle regimen , discontinued prematurely for unacceptable bleeding ( 7 . 7 % [ levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets ] vs . 1 . 8 % [ 28 - day cycle regimen ] ) .
Unscheduled bleeding and unscheduled spotting decreased over successive 91 - day cycles .
Table 3 below presents the number of days with unscheduled bleeding and / or spotting for each respective 91 - day cycle .
Table 3 : Number of Unscheduled Bleeding and / or Spotting Days per 91 - day CycleQ1 = Quartile 1 : 25 % of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding / spotting Median : 50 % of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding / spotting Q3 = Quartile 3 : 75 % of women had ≤ this number of days of unscheduled bleeding / spotting Cycle ( N ) Days of Unscheduled Bleeding and / or Spotting per 84 - Day Interval Median Days Per Subject - Month Mean Q1 Median Q3 1 ( 446 ) 15 . 1 3 . 0 12 23 . 0 3 . 0 2 ( 368 ) 11 . 6 2 . 0 6 17 . 5 1 . 5 3 ( 309 ) 10 . 6 1 . 0 6 15 . 0 1 . 5 4 ( 282 ) 8 . 8 1 . 0 4 14 . 0 1 . 0 Table 4 shows the percentages of women with ≥ 7 days and ≥ 20 days of unscheduled spotting and / or bleeding in the levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets and the 28 - day cycle treatment groups .
Table 4 : Percentage of Subjects with Unscheduled Bleeding and / or SpottingDays of unscheduled bleeding and / or spotting Percentage of Subjects [ 1 ] Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets Cycle 1 ( N = 385 ) Cycle 4 ( N = 261 ) ≥ 7 days 65 % 42 % ≥ 20 days 35 % 15 % 28 - day regimen Cycles 1 - 4 ( N = 194 ) Cycles 10 - 13 ( N = 158 ) ≥ 7 days 38 % 39 % ≥ 20 days 6 % 4 % [ 1 ] Based on spotting and / or bleeding on days 1 - 84 of a 91 day cycle in the levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets subjects and days 1 - 21 of a 28 day cycle over 4 cycles in the 28 - day dosing regimen .
Total days of bleeding and / or spotting ( scheduled plus unscheduled ) were similar over one year of treatment for levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets subjects and subjects on the 28 - day cycle regimen .
Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who are not pregnant and use levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets may experience amenorrhea .
Based on data from the clinical trial , amenorrhea occurred in approximately 0 . 8 % of women during Cycle 1 , 1 . 2 % of women during Cycle 2 , 3 . 7 % of women during Cycle 3 , and 3 . 4 % of women during Cycle 4 .
Because women using levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets will likely have scheduled bleeding only 4 times per year , rule out pregnancy at the time of any missed menstrual period .
Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after stopping COCs , especially when such a condition was preexistent .
5 . 9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy .
Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect , particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb - reduction defects are concerned , when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy .
Discontinue levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets use if pregnancy is confirmed .
Administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 10 Depression Depression associated with the use of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets has been reported .
Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets if severe depression recurs .
5 . 11 Malignant Neoplasms Breast cancer Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets are contraindicated in females who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between use of combined oral contraceptives ( COCs ) and breast cancer risk .
Studies do not show an association between ever ( current or past ) use of COCs and risk of breast cancer .
However , some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users ( < 6 months since last use ) and current users with longer duration of COC use [ see Postmarketing Experience ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Cervical Cancer Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia .
However , there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors .
5 . 12 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine - binding globulin , sex hormone - binding globulin and cortisol - binding globulin .
The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased .
5 . 13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated health care .
5 . 14 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema , exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema .
5 . 15 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur , especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum .
Women with a tendency to develop chloasma should avoid prolonged exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in the labeling : • • Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Vascular events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Liver disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are : • • Irregular uterine bleeding • • Nausea • • Breast tenderness • • Headache • • The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 2 % ) reported during clinical trials were headache , menorrhagia , nausea , dysmenorrhea , acne , migraine , breast tenderness , weight increased , and depression .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Mylan at 1 - 877 - 446 - 3679 ( 1 - 877 - 4 - INFO - RX ) or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
The clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets was a 12 - month , randomized , multicenter , open - label study , which enrolled women aged 18 - 40 , of whom 456 took at least one dose of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets ( 345 . 14 woman - years of exposure ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation : 14 . 9 % of the women discontinued from the clinical trial due to an adverse reaction ; the most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 1 % of women ) leading to discontinuation in the levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets group were menorrhagia ( 5 . 7 % ) , mood swings ( 1 . 9 % ) , weight / appetite increase ( 1 . 5 % ) , and acne ( 1 . 3 % ) .
Common Adverse Reactions ( ≥ 2 % of women ) : headache ( 20 . 6 % ) , menorrhagia ( 11 . 6 % ) , nausea ( 7 . 5 % ) , dysmenorrhea ( 5 . 7 % ) , acne ( 4 . 6 % ) , migraine ( 4 . 4 % ) , breast tenderness ( 3 . 5 % ) , weight increased ( 3 . 1 % ) , and depression ( 2 . 1 % ) .
Serious Adverse Reactions : pulmonary embolus , cholecystitis .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Five studies that compared breast cancer risk between ever - users ( current or past use ) of COCs and never - users of COCs reported no association between ever use of COCs and breast cancer risk , with effect estimates ranging from 0 . 90 - 1 . 12 ( Figure C ) .
Three studies compared breast cancer risk between current or recent COC users ( < 6 months since last use ) and never users of COCs ( Figure C ) .
One of these studies reported no association between breast cancer risk and COC use .
The other two studies found an increased relative risk of 1 . 19 - 1 . 33 with current or recent use .
Both of these studies found an increased risk of breast cancer with current use of longer duration , with relative risks ranging from 1 . 03 with less than one year of COC use to approximately 1 . 4 with more than 8 - 10 years of COC use .
Figure C : Relevant Studies of Risk of Breast Cancer with Combined Oral Contraceptives [ MULTIMEDIA ] RR = relative risk ; OR = odds ratio ; HR = hazard ratio .
“ ever COC ” are females with current or past COC use ; “ never COC use ” are females that never used COCs .
The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Gastrointestinal disorders : abdominal distension , vomiting General disorders and administration site conditions : chest pain , fatigue , malaise , edema peripheral , pain Immune system disorder : hypersensitivity reactions , including itching , rash , and angioedema Investigations : blood pressure increased Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : muscle spasms , pain in extremity Nervous system disorders : dizziness , loss of consciousness Psychiatric disorders : insomnia Reproductive and breast disorders : dysmenorrhea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : alopecia Vascular disorders : thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , pulmonary thrombosis [ MULTIMEDIA ] 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations .
Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes ( for example CYP3A4 ) may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding .
Counsel patients to use a back - up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminishing the efficacy of COCs Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes , including cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) , may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding .
Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin , barbiturates , carbamazepine , bosentan , felbamate , griseofulvin , oxcarbazepine , rifampicin , topiramate , rifabutin , rufinamide , aprepitant , and products containing St . John ’ s wort .
Interactions between oral contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and / or contraceptive failure .
Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back - up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs , and to continue back - up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability .
Colesevelam Colesevelam , a bile acid sequestrant , given together with a COC , has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE .
The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart .
Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs Co - administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol ( EE ) increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20 - 25 % .
Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations , possibly by inhibition of conjugation .
CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole , voriconazole , fluconazole , grapefruit juice , or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations .
Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) / Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) protease inhibitors and non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors Significant changes ( increase or decrease ) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and / or progestin have been noted in some cases of co - administration with HIV protease inhibitors ( decrease [ e . g . , nelfinavir , ritonavir , darunavir / ritonavir , ( fos ) amprenavir / ritonavir , lopinavir / ritonavir , and tipranavir / ritonavir ] or increase [ e . g . , indinavir and atazanavir / ritonavir ] ) / HCV protease inhibitors ( decrease [ e . g . , nevirapine ] or increase [ e . g . , etravirine ] ) .
7 . 2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds ( e . g . , cyclosporine , prednisolone , theophylline , tizanidine , and voriconazole ) and increase their plasma concentrations .
COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen , clofibric acid , morphine , salicylic acid , temazepam and lamotrigine .
Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown , likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation .
This may reduce seizure control ; therefore , dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary .
Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid - binding globulin increases with use of COCs [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) ] .
7 . 3 Concomitant Use with Hepatitis C Vaccine ( HCV ) Combination Therapy – Liver Enzyme Elevation Do not co - administer levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir , due to potential for ALT elevations [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 4 Interactions with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests , such as coagulation factors , lipids , glucose tolerance , and binding proteins .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Nursing Mothers : Advise use of another contraceptive method .
Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets can decrease milk production .
( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy There is little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who inadvertently use COCs during early pregnancy .
Epidemiologic studies and meta - analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non - genital birth defects ( including cardiac anomalies and limb - reduction defects ) following exposure to low dose COCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy .
Do not administer COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding as a test for pregnancy .
Do not use COCs during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Advise the nursing mother to use other forms of contraception , when possible , until she has weaned her child .
COCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers .
This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well established ; however , it can occur at any time in some women .
Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and / or metabolites are present in breast milk .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets have been established in women of reproductive age .
Efficacy is expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 as for users 18 years and older .
Use of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets before menarche is not indicated .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets have not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets have not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment .
However , steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with hepatic impairment .
Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets have not been studied in women with renal impairment .
10 OVERDOSAGE There have been no reports of serious ill effects from overdose of oral contraceptives , including ingestion by children .
Overdosage may cause withdrawal bleeding in females and nausea .
11 DESCRIPTION Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets , USP are an extended - cycle combination oral contraceptive consisting of 84 white to off - white active tablets each containing 0 . 15 mg of levonorgestrel , a synthetic progestin and 0 . 03 mg of ethinyl estradiol , an estrogen , and 7 green inert tablets ( without hormones ) .
The structural formulas for the active components are : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Levonorgestrel is chemically 18 , 19 - Dinorpregn - 4 - en - 20 - yn - 3 - one , 13 - ethyl - 17 - hydroxy - , ( 17α ) - , ( - ) - .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Ethinyl Estradiol is 19 - Norpregna - 1 , 3 , 5 ( 10 ) - trien - 20 - yne - 3 , 17 - diol , ( 17α ) - .
• • Each white to off - white active tablet contains the following inactive ingredients : lactose monohydrate , magnesium stearate and polacrilin potassium .
• • Each green inert tablet contains the following inactive ingredients : FD & C Blue No . 1 Aluminum Lake , lactose monohydrate , magnesium stearate , polacrilin potassium and yellow oxide of iron .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action COCs lower the risk of becoming pregnant primarily by suppressing ovulation .
Other possible mechanisms may include cervical mucus changes that inhibit sperm penetration and endometrial changes that reduce the likelihood of implantation .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption No specific investigation of the absolute bioavailability of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets in humans has been conducted .
However , literature indicates that levonorgestrel is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration ( bioavailability nearly 100 % ) and is not subject to first - pass metabolism .
EE is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but , due to first - pass metabolism in gut mucosa and liver , the bioavailability of EE is approximately 43 % .
Following continuous dosing with once - daily administration of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets , plasma concentrations of levonorgestrel and EE reached steady - state within 7 days .
The mean plasma pharmacokinetic parameters for levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets under fasting conditions in normal healthy women following once - daily administration of one levonorgestrel / EE combination tablet for 10 days are summarized in Table 5 .
Table 5 : Mean ± SD Pharmacokinetic Parameters Under Fasting Conditions in Healthy Women Following 10 Days Administration of One Tablet of Levonorgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol Tablets ( n = 44 ) Analyte AUC0 - 24 Cmax Cmin Cavg [ 1 ] Tmax Levonorgestrel 54 . 6 ± 16 . 5 ng * hr / mL 5 . 0 ± 1 . 5 ng / mL 1 . 6 ± 0 . 5 ng / mL 2 . 3 ± 0 . 7 ng / mL 1 . 4 ± 0 . 7 hours Ethinyl estradiol 935 . 5 ± 346 . 9 pg * hr / mL 106 . 1 ± 41 . 2 pg / mL 18 . 5 ± 9 . 4 pg / mL 38 . 9 ± 14 . 4 pg / mL 1 . 6 ± 0 . 6 hours [ 1 ] Cavg = AUC0 - 24 / 24 Food Effect The effect of food on the rate and the extent of levonorgestrel and EE absorption following oral administration of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets has not been evaluated .
Distribution The apparent volume of distribution of levonorgestrel and EE are reported to be approximately 1 . 8 L / kg and 4 . 3 L / kg , respectively .
Levonorgestrel is about 97 . 5 - 99 % protein - bound , principally to sex hormone binding globulin ( SHBG ) and , to a lesser extent , serum albumin .
EE is about 95 - 97 % bound to serum albumin .
EE does not bind to SHBG , but induces SHBG synthesis , which leads to decreased levonorgestrel clearance .
Following repeated daily dosing of levonorgestrel / EE oral contraceptives , levonorgestrel plasma concentrations accumulate more than predicted based on single - dose pharmacokinetics , due in part , to increased SHBG levels that are induced by EE , and a possible reduction in hepatic metabolic capacity .
Metabolism Following absorption , levonorgestrel is conjugated at the 17β - OH position to form sulfate and to a lesser extent , glucuronide conjugates in plasma .
Significant amounts of conjugated and unconjugated 3α , 5β - tetrahydrolevonorgestrel are also present in plasma , along with much smaller amounts of 3α , 5α - tetrahydrolevonorgestrel and 16β - hydroxylevonorgestrel .
Levonorgestrel and its phase I metabolites are excreted primarily as glucuronide conjugates .
Metabolic clearance rates may differ among individuals by several - fold , and this may account in part for the wide variation observed in levonorgestrel concentrations among users .
First - pass metabolism of EE involves formation of EE - 3 - sulfate in the gut wall , followed by 2 - hydroxylation of a portion of the remaining untransformed EE by hepatic cytochrome P - 450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) .
Levels of CYP3A4 vary widely among individuals and can explain the variation in rates of EE hydroxylation .
Hydroxylation at the 4 - , 6 - , and 16 - positions may also occur , although to a much lesser extent than 2 - hydroxylation .
The various hydroxylated metabolites are subject to further methylation and / or conjugation .
Excretion About 45 % of levonorgestrel and its metabolites are excreted in the urine and about 32 % are excreted in feces , mostly as glucuronide conjugates .
The terminal elimination half - life for levonorgestrel after a single dose of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets was about 30 hours .
EE is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates , and it undergoes enterohepatic recirculation .
The terminal elimination half - life of EE after a single dose of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets was found to be about 15 hours .

14 CLINICAL STUDIES In a 12 - month , multicenter , randomized , open - label clinical trial , 456 women aged 18 - 40 were studied to assess the safety and efficacy of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets , completing 809 91 - day cycles of exposure .
The racial demographic of those enrolled was : Caucasian ( 77 % ) , African - American ( 11 % ) , Hispanic ( 7 % ) , Asian ( 2 % ) , and Other ( 3 % ) .
There were no exclusions for body mass index ( BMI ) or weight .
The weight range of those women treated was 84 to 304 pounds , with a mean weight of 157 pounds and a median weight of 147 pounds .
Among the women in the trial , 63 % were current or recent hormonal contraceptive users , 29 % were prior users ( who had used hormonal contraceptives in the past but not in the 6 months prior to enrollment ) , and 8 % were new starts .
The pregnancy rate ( Pearl Index [ PI ] ) in the 397 women aged 18 - 35 years was 1 . 98 pregnancies per 100 women - years of use ( 95 % CI : 0 . 54 to 5 . 03 ) , based on 4 pregnancies that occurred after the onset of treatment and within 14 days after the last combination pill .
Cycles in which conception did not occur , but which included the use of back - up contraception , were not included in the calculation of the PI .
