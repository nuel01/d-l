pH ( 4 . 0 - 8 . 0 ) may have been adjusted with hydrochloric acid and if necessary , potassium hydroxide .
Some packages are intended for multiple dose use and contain preservatives ( 0 . 05 % methylparaben and 0 . 005 % propylparaben ) .
A summary of the available products is presented in the HOW SUPPLIED section .
Potassium Chloride for Injection Concentrate ( appropriately diluted ) is a parenteral fluid and electrolyte replenisher .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Potassium is the chief cation of body cells ( 160 mEq / L of intracellular water ) and is concerned with the maintenance of body fluid composition and electrolyte balance .
Potassium participates in carbohydrate utilization and protein synthesis , and is critical in the regulation of nerve conduction and muscle contraction , particularly in the heart .
Chloride , the major extracellular anion , closely follows the metabolism of sodium , and changes in the acid - base balance of the body are reflected by changes in the chloride concentration .
Normally about 80 to 90 % of the potassium intake is excreted in the urine , the remainder in the stools and to a small extent , in the perspiration .
The kidney does not conserve potassium well , so that during fasting , or in patients on a potassium - free diet , potassium loss from the body continues resulting in potassium depletion .
A deficiency of either potassium or chloride will lead to a deficit of the other .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Potassium Chloride for Injection Concentrate , USP is indicated in the treatment of potassium deficiency states when oral replacement is not feasible .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Potassium Chloride for Injection Concentrate is contraindicated in diseases where high potassium levels may be encountered , and in patients with hyperkalemia , renal failure and in conditions in which potassium retention is present .
WARNINGS WARNING : This product contains aluminum that may be toxic .
Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired .
Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature , and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions , which contain aluminum .
Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function , including premature neonates , who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg / kg / day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity .
Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration .
To avoid potassium intoxication , do not infuse these solutions rapidly .
In patients with renal insufficiency , administration of potassium chloride may cause potassium intoxication and life - threatening hyperkalemia .
The administration of intravenous solutions can cause fluid and / or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration .
The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentration .
PRECAUTIONS GeneralClinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance , electrolyte concentrations , and acid - base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation .
Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require the use of additional electrolyte supplements , or the use of electrolyte - free dextrose solutions to which individualized electrolyte supplements may be added .
Potassium therapy should be guided primarily by serial electrocardiograms , especially in patients receiving digitalis .
Serum potassium levels are not necessarily indicative of tissue potassium levels .
Solutions containing potassium should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease , particularly in the presence of renal disease , and in such instances , cardiac monitoring is recommended .
Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with overt or known subclinical diabetes mellitus , or carbohydrate intolerance for any reason .
If the administration is controlled by a pumping device , care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category C — Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with potassium chloride .
It is also not known whether potassium chloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Potassium chloride should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response , infection at the site of injection , venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection , extravasation , hypervolemia , and hyperkalemia .
Too rapid infusion of hypertonic solutions may cause local pain and , rarely , vein irritation .
Rate of administration should be adjusted according to tolerance .
Reactions reported with the use of potassium - containing solutions include nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain and diarrhea .
The signs and symptoms of potassium intoxication include paresthesias of the extremities , areflexia , muscular or respiratory paralysis , mental confusion , weakness , hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias , heart block , electrocardiographic abnormalities and cardiac arrest .
Potassium deficits result in disruption of neuromuscular function , and intestinal ileus and dilatation .
If an adverse reaction does occur , discontinue the infusion , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of fluid overload during parenteral therapy , reevaluate the patient ' s condition , and institute appropriate corrective treatment .
In the event of overdosage with potassium - containing solutions , discontinue the infusion immediately and institute corrective therapy to reduce serum potassium levels .
Treatment of hyperkalemia includes the following : • Dextrose Injection , USP , 10 % or 25 % , containing 10 units of crystalline insulin per 20 grams of dextrose administered intravenously , 300 to 500 mL / hour .
• Absorption and exchange of potassium using sodium or ammonium cycle cation exchange resin , orally and as retention enema .
• Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis .
The use of potassium - containing foods or medications must be eliminated .
However , in cases of digitalization , too rapid a lowering of plasma potassium concentration can cause digitalis toxicity .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Potassium Chloride for Injection Concentrate must be diluted before administration .
Care must be taken to ensure there is complete mixing of the potassium chloride with the large volume fluid , particularly if soft or bag type containers are used .
The dose and rate of administration are dependent upon the specific condition of each patient .
If the serum potassium level is greater than 2 . 5 mEq / L , potassium can be given at a rate not to exceed 10 mEq / hour and in a concentration of up to 40 mEq / L .
The 24 hour total dose should not exceed 200 mEq .
If urgent treatment is indicated ( serum potassium level less than 2 mEq / L and electrocardiographic changes and / or muscle paralysis ) , potassium chloride may be infused very cautiously at a rate of up to 40 mEq / hour .
In such cases , continuous cardiac monitoring is essential .
As much as 400 mEq may be administered in a 24 hour period .
In critical conditions , potassium chloride may be administered in saline ( unless contraindicated ) rather than in dextrose containing fluids , as dextrose may lower serum potassium levels .
Prior to entering a vial , cleanse the rubber closure with a suitable antiseptic agent .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit .
