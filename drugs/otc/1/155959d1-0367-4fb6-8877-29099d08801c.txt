Rx only DESCRIPTION Collagenase Santyl ◊ Ointment is a sterile enzymatic debriding ointment which contains 250 collagenase units per gram of white petrolatum USP .
The enzyme collagenase is derived from the fermentation by Clostridium histolyticum .
It possesses the unique ability to digest collagen in necrotic tissue .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Since collagen accounts for 75 % of the dry weight of skin tissue , the ability of collagenase to digest collagen in the physiological pH and temperature range makes it particularly effective in the removal of detritus .
1 Collagenase thus contributes towards the formation of granulation tissue and subsequent epithelization of dermal ulcers and severely burned areas .
2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 Collagen in healthy tissue or in newly formed granulation tissue is not attacked .
2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 There is no information available on collagenase absorption through skin or its concentration in body fluids associated with therapeutic and / or toxic effects , degree of binding to plasma proteins , degree of uptake by a particular organ or in the fetus , and passage across the blood brain barrier .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Collagenase Santyl ◊ Ointment is indicated for debriding chronic dermal ulcers 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 and severely burned areas .
3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 16 , 19 , 20 , 21 CONTRAINDICATIONS Collagenase Santyl ◊ Ointment is contraindicated in patients who have shown local or systemic hypersensitivity to collagenase .
PRECAUTIONS The optimal pH range of collagenase is 6 to 8 .
Higher or lower pH conditions will decrease the enzyme ’ s activity and appropriate precautions should be taken .
The enzymatic activity is also adversely affected by certain detergents , and heavy metal ions such as mercury and silver which are used in some antiseptics .
When it is suspected such materials have been used , the site should be carefully cleansed by repeated washings with normal saline before Collagenase Santyl ◊ Ointment is applied .
Soaks containing metal ions or acidic solutions should be avoided because of the metal ion and low pH . Cleansing materials such as Dakin ’ s solution and normal saline are compatible with Collagenase Santyl ◊ Ointment .
Debilitated patients should be closely monitored for systemic bacterial infections because of the theoretical possibility that debriding enzymes may increase the risk of bacteremia .
A slight transient erythema has been noted occasionally in the surrounding tissue , particularly when Collagenase Santyl ◊ Ointment was not confined to the wound .
Therefore , the ointment should be applied carefully within the area of the wound .
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
ADVERSE REACTIONS No allergic sensitivity or toxic reactions have been noted in clinical use when used as directed .
However , one case of systemic manifestations of hypersensitivity to collagenase in a patient treated for more than one year with a combination of collagenase and cortisone has been reported .
OVERDOSAGE No systemic or local reaction attributed to overdose has been observed in clinical investigations and clinical use .
If deemed necessary the enzyme may be inactivated by washing the area with povidone iodine .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Collagenase Santyl ◊ Ointment should be applied once daily ( or more frequently if the dressing becomes soiled , as from incontinence ) .
When clinically indicated , crosshatching thick eschar with a # 10 blade allows Collagenase Santyl ◊ Ointment more surface contact with necrotic debris .
It is also desirable to remove , with forceps and scissors , as much loosened detritus as can be done readily .
Use Collagenase Santyl ◊ Ointment in the following manner : 1 - Prior to application the wound should be cleansed of debris and digested material by gently rubbing with a gauze pad saturated with normal saline solution , or with the desired cleansing agent compatible with Collagenase Santyl ◊ Ointment ( See PRECAUTIONS ) , followed by a normal saline solution rinse .
2 - Whenever infection is present , it is desirable to use an appropriate topical antibiotic powder .
The antibiotic should be applied to the wound prior to the application of Collagenase Santyl ◊ Ointment .
Should the infection not respond , therapy with Collagenase Santyl ◊ Ointment should be discontinued until remission of the infection .
3 - Collagenase Santyl ◊ Ointment may be applied directly to the wound or to a sterile gauze pad which is then applied to the wound and properly secured .
4 - Use of Collagenase Santyl ◊ Ointment should be terminated when debridement of necrotic tissue is complete and granulation tissue is well established .
