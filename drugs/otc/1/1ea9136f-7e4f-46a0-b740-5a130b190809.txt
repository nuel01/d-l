6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
In 626 subjects treated with Ciclopirox Shampoo twice weekly in the two pivotal clinical trials , the most frequent adverse events were increased itching in 1 % of subjects , and application site reactions , such as burning , erythema , and itching , also in 1 % of subjects .
6 . 2 Post Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Ciclopirox Shampoo : hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture , alopecia , irritation and rash .
Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category B There are no adequate or well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Therefore , Ciclopirox Shampoo should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Oral embryofetal developmental studies were conducted in mice , rats , rabbits and monkeys .
Ciclopirox or ciclopirox olamine was orally administered during the period of organogenesis .
No maternal toxicity , embryotoxicity or teratogenicity were noted at the highest doses of 77 , 125 , 80 and 38 . 5 mg / kg / day ciclopirox in mice , rats , rabbits and monkeys , respectively ( approximately 13 , 42 , 54 and 26 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area comparisons , respectively ) .
Dermal embryofetal developmental studies were conducted in rats and rabbits with ciclopirox olamine dissolved in PEG 400 .
Ciclopirox olamine was topically administered during the period of organogenesis .
No maternal toxicity , embryotoxicity or teratogenicity were noted at the highest doses of 92 mg / kg / day and 77 mg / kg / day ciclopirox in rats and rabbits , respectively ( approximately 31 and 54 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area comparisons , respectively ) .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when Ciclopirox Shampoo is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use No clinical trials have been conducted in subjects younger than 16 years .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In clinical trials , the safety and tolerability of Ciclopirox Shampoo in the population 65 years and older was comparable to that of younger subjects .
Results of the efficacy analysis in those subjects 65 years and older showed effectiveness in 25 of 85 ( 29 % ) subjects treated with Ciclopirox Shampoo , and in 15 of 61 ( 25 % ) subjects treated with the vehicle ; due to the small sample size , a statistically significant difference was not demonstrated .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects , but greater sensitivity to adverse effects in some older individuals cannot be ruled out .

The serum concentrations measured throughout the dosing interval on Days 1 and 29 ranged from 10 . 3 ng / mL to 13 . 2 ng / mL .
Total urinary excretion of ciclopirox was less than 0 . 5 % of the administered dose .
12 . 4 Microbiology Ciclopirox is fungicidal in vitro against Malassezia furfur ( Pityrosporum spp . )
, P . ovale , and P . orbiculare .
The clinical significance of antifungal activity in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis is not known .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , and Impairment of Fertility A 104 - week dermal carcinogenicity study in mice was conducted with ciclopirox cream applied at doses up to 1 . 93 % ( 100 mg / kg / day or 300 mg / m2 / day ) .
No increase in drug related neoplasms was noted when compared to control .
The following in vitro genotoxicity tests have been conducted with ciclopirox : evaluation of gene mutation in the Ames Salmonella and E . coli assays ( negative ) ; chromosome aberration assays in V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells , with and without metabolic activation ( positive ) ; chromosome aberration assays in V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells in the presence of supplemental Fe3 + , with and without metabolic activation ( negative ) ; gene mutation assays in the HGPRT - test with V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cells ( negative ) ; and a primary DNA damage assay ( i . e . , unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in A549 human cells ) ( negative ) .
An in vitro cell transformation assay in BALB / c 3T3 cells was negative for cell transformation .
In an in vivo Chinese hamster bone marrow cytogenetic assay , ciclopirox was negative for chromosome aberrations at a dosage of 5000 mg / kg body weight .
A combined oral fertility and embryofetal developmental study was conducted in rats with ciclopirox olamine .
No effect on fertility or reproductive performance was noted at the highest dose tested of 3 . 85 mg / kg / day ciclopirox ( approximately 1 . 3 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area comparisons ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES In two randomized , double - blind clinical trials , subjects 16 years and older with seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp applied Ciclopirox Shampoo or its vehicle twice weekly for 4 weeks .
Subjects who were immunocompromised , those with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis , women of childbearing potential not using adequate contraception , and pregnant or lactating women were excluded from the clinical trials .
An evaluation of the overall status of the seborrheic dermatitis , the presence and severity of erythema or inflammation , and scaling , was made at week 4 , using a scale of 0 = none , 1 = slight , 2 = mild , 3 = moderate , 4 = pronounced , and 5 = severe .
Effective treatment was defined as achieving a score of 0 ( or a score of 1 if the baseline score was ≥ 3 ) simultaneously for status of the seborrheic dermatitis , erythema or inflammation , and scaling at Week 4 .
Ciclopirox shampoo was shown to be statistically significantly more effective than vehicle in both trials .
Efficacy results for the two trials are presented in Table 1 below .
