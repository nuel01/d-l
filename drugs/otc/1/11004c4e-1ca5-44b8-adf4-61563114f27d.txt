CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation USP is utilized for a variety of clinical indications such as sterile irrigation of body cavities , tissues or wounds , indwelling urethral catheters , surgical drainage tubes , and for washing , rinsing or soaking surgical dressings , instruments and laboratory specimens .
It also serves as a diluent or vehicle for drugs used for irrigation or other pharmaceutical preparations .
0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation USP provides an isotonic saline irrigation identical in composition with 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection USP ( normal saline ) .
Physiological irrigation solutions are considered generally compatible with living tissues and organs .
Sodium , the major cation of the extracellular fluid , functions primarily in the control of water distribution , fluid balance , and osmotic pressure of body fluids .
Sodium is also associated with chloride and bicarbonate in the regulation of the acid - base equilibrium of body fluid .
Chloride , the major extracellular anion , closely follows the metabolism of sodium , and changes in the acid - base balance of the body are reflected by changes in the chloride concentration .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation USP is indicated for all general irrigation , washing , rinsing and dilution purposes which permit use of a sterile , nonpyrogenic electrolyte solution .
CONTRAINDICATIONS 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation USP is not for injection by usual parenteral routes .
An electrolyte solution should not be used for irrigation during electrosurgical procedures .
WARNINGS FOR IRRIGATION ONLY .
NOT FOR INJECTION .
Irrigating fluids have been demonstrated to enter the systemic circulation in relatively large volumes ; thus , irrigation solutions must be regarded as systemic drugs .
Absorption of large amounts can cause fluid and / or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the administered parenteral solutions .
The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentration .
Do not warm above 150 ° F ( 66 ° C ) .
After opening container , its contents should be used promptly to minimize the possibility of bacterial growth or pyrogen formation .
Discard unused portion of irrigating solution since it contains no preservatives .
PRECAUTIONS General Use aseptic technique when preparing and administering sterile irrigation solutions .
Use only if solution is clear and container and seal are intact .
Do not use for irrigation that may result in absorption of large amounts of fluid into the blood .
Caution should be observed when the solution is used for continuous irrigation or allowed to " dwell " inside body cavities because of possible absorption into the blood stream and the production of circulatory overload .
When used for irrigation via appropriate irrigation equipment , the administration set should be attached promptly .
Unused portions should be discarded and a fresh container of appropriate size used for the start up of each cycle or repeat procedure .
For repeated irrigations of urethral catheters , a separate container should be used for each patient .
Laboratory Tests Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance , electrolyte concentrations , and acid - base balance after prolonged irrigation , when fluid absorption is suspected , or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation .
Drug Interactions Some additives may be incompatible .
Consult with pharmacist .
When introducing additives , use aseptic technique .
Mix thoroughly .
Do not store .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Studies with 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation USP have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , mutagenic potential , or effects on fertility .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects - Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation USP .
It is also not known whether 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Labor and Delivery Safety and effectiveness of 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation USP during labor and delivery have not been established .
Caution should be exercised , and the fluid balance , glucose and electrolyte concentrations , and acid - base balance , of both mother and fetus should be evaluated periodically or whenever warranted by the condition of the patient or fetus .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation USP is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation USP in pediatric patients have not been established .
Its limited use in pediatric patients has been inadequate to fully define proper dosage and limitations for use .
Geriatric Use Clinical studies of 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation USP did not include a sufficient number of patients age 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
Frequent laboratory determinations and clinical evaluations are recommended to monitor changes in blood glucose , electrolyte concentrations , and renal function .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Possible adverse effects arising from the irrigation of body cavities , tissues , or indwelling catheters and tubes can be minimized when proper procedures are followed .
Displaced catheters or drainage tubes can lead to irrigation or infiltration of unintended structures or cavities .
Excessive volume or pressure during irrigation of closed cavities may cause undue distension or disruption of tissues .
Accidental contamination from careless technique may transmit infection .
If an adverse reaction does occur , discontinue administration of the irrigant , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures , and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of overhydration or solute overload , reevaluate the patient ' s condition , and institute appropriate corrective treatment .
Intravasular volume overload may respond to hemodialysis .
See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and ADVERSE REACTIONS .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION As required for irrigation .
When used as a diluent , or vehicle for other drugs , the drug manufacturer ' s recommendations should be followed .
Some additives may be incompatible .
Consult with pharmacist .
When introducing additives , use aseptic techniques .
Mix thoroughly .
Do not store .
Solutions should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permits .
