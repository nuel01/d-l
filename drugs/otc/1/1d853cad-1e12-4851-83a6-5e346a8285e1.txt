[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY BENZONATATE acts peripherally by anesthetizing the stretch receptors located in the respiratory passages , lungs , and pleura by dampening their activity and thereby reducing the cough reflex at its source .
It begins to act within 15 to 20 minutes and its effect lasts for 3 to 8 hours .
BENZONATATE has no inhibitory effect on the respiratory center in recommended dosage .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE BENZONATATE is indicated for the symptomatic relief of cough .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to benzonatate or related compounds .
WARNINGS Hypersensitivity Severe hypersensitivity reactions ( including bronchospasm , laryngospasm and cardiovascular collapse ) have been reported which are possibly related to local anesthesia from sucking or chewing the capsule instead of swallowing it .
Severe reactions have required intervention with vasopressor agents and supportive measures .

To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Bionpharma at 1 - 888 - 235 - 2466 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch OVERDOSAGE Intentional and unintentional overdose may result in death , particularly in children .
The drug is chemically related to tetracaine and other topical anesthetics and shares various aspects of their pharmacology and toxicology .
Drugs of this type are generally well absorbed after ingestion .
Signs and Symptoms : The signs and symptoms of overdose of benzonatate have been reported within 15 - 20 minutes .
If capsules are chewed or dissolved in the mouth , oropharyngeal anesthesia will develop rapidly , which may cause choking and airway compromise .
CNS stimulation may cause restlessness and tremors which may proceed to clonic convulsions followed by profound CNS depression .
Convulsions , coma , cerebral edema and cardiac arrest leading to death have been reported within 1 hour of ingestion .
Treatment : In case of overdose , seek medical attention immediately .
Evacuate gastric contents and administer copious amounts of activated charcoal slurry .
Even in the conscious patient , cough and gag reflexes may be so depressed as to necessitate special attention to protection against aspiration of gastric contents and orally administered materials .
Convulsions should be treated with a short - acting barbiturate given intravenously and carefully titrated for the smallest effective dosage .
Intensive support of respiration and cardiovascular - renal function is an essential feature of the treatment of severe intoxication from overdosage .
Do not use CNS stimulants .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adults and Children over 10 years of age : Usual dose is one 100 mg or 200 mg capsule three times a day as needed for cough .
If necessary to control cough , up to 600 mg daily in three divided doses may be given .
