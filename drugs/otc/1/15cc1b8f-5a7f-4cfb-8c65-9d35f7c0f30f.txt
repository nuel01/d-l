Since corticosteroids may inhibit the body ' s defense mechanism against infection , concomitant antimicrobial drugs may be used when this inhibition is considered to be clinically significant in a particular case .
When a decision to administer both a corticosteroid and antimicrobials is made , the administration of such drugs in combination has the advantage of greater patient compliance and convenience , with the added assurance that the appropriate dosage of all drugs is administered .
When each type of drug is in the same formulation , compatibility of ingredients is assured and the correct volume of drug is delivered and retained .
The relative potency of corticosteroids depends on the molecular structure , concentration , and release from the vehicle .
Microbiology The anti - infective components in Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates and Hydrocortisone Ophthalmic Suspension are included to provide action against specific organisms susceptible to it .
Neomycin sulfate and polymyxin B sulfate are active in vitro against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms : Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli , Haemophilus influenzae , Klebsiella / Enterobacter species , Neisseria species , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
The product does not provide adequate coverage against Serratia marcescens and streptococci , including Streptococcus pneumoniae [ see Indications and Usage ] .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates and Hydrocortisone Ophthalmic Suspension is indicated for steroid - responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where bacterial infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists .
Ocular corticosteroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva , cornea and anterior segment of the globe where the inherent risk of corticosteroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation .
They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical , radiation , or thermal burns , or penetration of foreign bodies .
The use of a combination drug with an anti - infective component is indicated where the risk of infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye [ see Clinical Pharmacology : Microbiology ] .
The particular anti - infective drugs in this product are active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens : Staphylococcus aureus , Escherichia coli , Haemophilus influenzae , Klebsiella / Enterobacter species , Neisseria species , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
The product does not provide adequate coverage against Serratia marcescens and streptococci , including Streptococcus pneumoniae .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates and Hydrocortisone Ophthalmic Suspension is contraindicated in most viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including : epithelial herpes simplex keratitis ( dendritic keratitis ) , vaccinia , and varicella , and also in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal diseases of ocular structures .
Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates and Hydrocortisone Ophthalmic Suspension is also contraindicated in individuals who have shown hypersensitivity to any of its components .
Hypersensitivity to the antibiotic component occurs at a higher rate than for other components .
WARNINGS NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE .
Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates and Hydrocortisone Ophthalmic Suspension should never be directly introduced into the anterior chamber of the eye .
Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in ocular hypertension and / or glaucoma , with damage to the optic nerve , defects in visual acuity and fields of vision , and posterior subcapsular cataract formation .
Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections .
In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera , perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical corticosteroids .
In acute purulent conditions of the eye , corticosteroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection .
If these products are used for 10 days or longer , intraocular pressure should be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in uncooperative patients .
Corticosteroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma .
The use of corticosteroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of filtering blebs .
Use of ocular corticosteroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye ( including herpes simplex ) .
Employment of corticosteroid medication in the treatment of herpes simplex requires great caution .
Topical antibiotics , particularly , neomycin sulfate , may cause cutaneous sensitization .
A precise incidence of hypersensitivity reactions ( primarily skin rash ) due to topical antibiotics is not known .
The manifestations of sensitization to topical antibiotics are usually itching , reddening , and edema of the conjunctiva and eyelid .
A sensitization reaction may manifest simply as a failure to heal .
During long - term use of topical antibiotic products , periodic examination for such signs is advisable , and the patient should be told to discontinue the product if they are observed .
Symptoms usually subside quickly on withdrawing the medication .
Application of products containing these ingredients should be avoided for the patient thereafter [ see Precautions : General ] .
PRECAUTIONS General The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 20 mL should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification , such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and , where appropriate , fluorescein staining .
If signs and symptoms fail to improve after 2 days , the patient should be re - evaluated .
The possibility of fungal infections of the cornea should be considered after prolonged corticosteroid dosing .
Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate .
If this product is used for 10 days or longer , intraocular pressure should be monitored [ see Warnings ] .
There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of topical ophthalmic products in multiple - dose containers which have been inadvertently contaminated by patients , most of whom had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [ see Precautions : Information for Patients ] .
Allergic cross - reactions may occur which could prevent the use of any or all of the following antibiotics for the treatment of future infections : kanamycin , paromomycin , streptomycin , and possibly gentamicin .
Information for Patients Patients should be instructed to avoid allowing the tip of the dispensing container to contact the eye , eyelid , fingers , or any other surface .
The use of this product by more than one person may spread infection .
Patients should also be instructed that ocular products , if handled improperly , can become contaminated by common bacteria known to cause ocular infections .
Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated products [ see Precautions : General ] .
If the condition persists or gets worse , or if a rash or allergic reaction develops , the patient should be advised to stop use and consult a physician .
Do not use this product if you are allergic to any of the listed ingredients .
Keep tightly closed when not in use .
Keep out of reach of children .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential have not been conducted with polymyxin B sulfate .
Treatment of cultured human lymphocytes in vitro with neomycin increased the frequency of chromosome aberrations at the highest concentrations ( 80 ug / mL ) tested ; however , the effects of neomycin on carcinogenesis and mutagenesis in humans are unknown .
Long - term studies in animals ( rats , rabbits , mice ) showed no evidence of carcinogenicity or mutagenicity attributable to oral administration of corticosteroids .
Long - term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of topical corticosteroids .
Studies to determine mutagenicity with hydrocortisone have revealed negative results .
Use of corticosteroid medication in the treatment of herpes simplex requires great caution .
Polymyxin B has been reported to impair the motility of equine sperm , but its effects on male or female fertility are unknown .
Long - term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the effect on fertility of topical corticosteroids .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C . Corticosteroids have been found to be teratogenic in rabbits when applied topically at concentrations of 0 . 5 % on days 6 - 18 of gestation and in mice when applied topically at a concentration of 15 % on days 10 - 13 of gestation .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates and Hydrocortisone Ophthalmic Suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk .
Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth , interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production , or cause other untoward effects .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates and Hydrocortisone Ophthalmic Suspension , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions have occurred with corticosteroid / anti - infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the corticosteroid component , the anti - infective component , or the combination .
The exact incidence is not known .
Reactions occurring most often from the presence of the anti - infective ingredient are allergic sensitization reactions including itching , swelling , and conjunctival erythema [ see Warnings ] .
More serious hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis , have been reported rarely .
The reactions due to the corticosteroid component in decreasing order of frequency are : elevation of intraocular pressure ( IOP ) with possible development of glaucoma , and infrequent optic nerve damage ; posterior subcapsular cataract formation ; and delayed wound healing .
Secondary Infection The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing corticosteroids and antimicrobials .
Fungal and viral infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long - term applications of a corticosteroid .
The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where corticosteroid treatment has been used .
Local irritation on instillation has also been reported .
