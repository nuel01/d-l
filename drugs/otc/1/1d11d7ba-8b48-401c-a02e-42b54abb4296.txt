Food allergenic extracts may be manufactured on a weight / volume ( w / v ) or volume / volume ( v / v ) basis .
Food extracts made from dried raw material are extracted at 2 - 10 % ( 1 : 50 - 1 : 10 w / v ratio ) in extracting fluid containing 50 % glycerine .
Slurries of juicy fruits or vegetables ( prepared with a minimum amount of water for injection ) are combined with an equal volume of glycerine for a ration of 1 : 1 volume / volume ( v / v ) .
Sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate are added to the slurry and glycerine mixture .
Fresh egg white extract is prepared by adding one part raw egg white to nine parts of extracting fluid ( 1 : 9 v / v ) .
Antigen E is considered the most important allergen of Short Ragweed pollen and is used for the standardization of Short Ragweed allergenic extracts .
Stock mixtures containing Short Ragweed are analyzed for Antigen E content by radial immunodiffusion using Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research ( CBER ) references and anti - serum .
Antigen E content expressed as units of Antigen E per milliliter ( U / ml ) is printed on container label .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Studies indicate allergic individuals produce immunoglobulins of the IgE class in response to exposure to allergens .
Subsequent exposure to the allergen results in a combination of allergen with IgE antibody fixed on mast cells or basophil membranes .
This cross - linking results in stimulation of mast cell which leads to release and generation of pharmacologically active substances that produce immediate hypersensitivity reaction . 3 The mode of action of immunotherapy with allergenic extracts is still under investigation .
Subcutaneous injections of increasing doses of allergenic extract into patients with allergic disease have been shown to result in both humoral and cellular changes including the production of allergen - specific IgG antibodies , the suppression of histamine release from target cells , decrease in circulating levels of antigen specific IgE antibody over long periods of time and suppression of peripheral blood T - lymphocyte cell responses to antigen . 10 , 14 , 15 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Allergenic extract is used for diagnostic testing and for the treatment ( immunotherapy ) of patients whose histories indicate that upon natural exposure to the allergen , they experience allergic symptoms .
Confirmation is determined by skin testing .
Diagnostic use of allergenic extracts usually begins with direct skin testing .
This product is not intended for treatment of patients who do not manifest immediate hypersensitivity reactions to the allergenic extract following skin testing .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not administer in the presence of diseases characterized by bleeding diathesis .
Individuals with autoimmune disease may be at risk of exacerbating symptoms of the underlying disease , possibly due to routine immunization .
Patients who have experienced a recent myocardial infarction may not be tolerant of immunotherapy .
Children with nephrotic syndrome probably should not receive injections due to immunization causing exacerbation of nephrotic disease .
WARNINGS Refer to boxed “ WARNINGS ” , “ PRECAUTIONS ” , “ ADVERSE REACTIONS ” and “ OVERDOSAGE ” sections for additional information on serious adverse reactions and steps to be taken , if any occur .
Extreme caution is necessary when using diagnostic skin tests or injection treatment in highly sensitive patients who have experienced severe symptoms or anaphylaxis by natural exposure , or during previous skin testing or treatment .
IN THESE CASES THE POTENCY FOR SKIN TESTS AND THE ESCALATION OF THE TREATMENT DOSE MUST BE ADJUSTED TO THE PATIENT ’ S SENSITIVITY AND TOLERANCE .
Benefit versus risk needs to be evaluated in steroid dependent asthmatics , patients with unstable asthma or patients with underlying cardiovascular disease .
Injections should never be given intravenously .
A 5 / 8 inch , 25 gauge needle on a sterile syringe allows deep subcutaneous injection .
Withdraw plunger slightly after inserting needle to determine if a blood vessel has been entered .
Proper measurement of dose and caution in making injection will minimize reactions .
Adverse reactions to allergenic extracts are usually apparent within 20 - 30 minutes following injection of immunotherapy .
Extract should be temporarily withheld or dosage reduced in case of any of the following conditions : 1 ) flu or other infection with fever ; 2 ) exposure to excessive amounts of allergen prior to injection ; 3 ) rhinitis and / or asthma exhibiting severe symptoms ; 4 ) adverse reaction to previous injection until cause of reaction has been evaluated by physician supervising patient ’ s immunotherapy program .
PRECAUTIONS General : Immunotherapy must be given under physician ’ s supervision .
Sterile solutions , vials , syringes , etc . must be used .
Aseptic technique must be observed in making dilutions from stock concentrates .
The usual precautions in administering allergenic extracts are necessary , refer to boxed WARNINGS and “ WARNINGS ” section .
Sterile syringe and needle must be used for each individual patient to prevent transmission of serum hepatitis , Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) and other infectious agents .
Epinephrine 1 : 1000 should be available .
Refer to “ OVERDOSAGE ” section for description of treatment for anaphylactic reactions .
Information for Patients : Patient should remain under observation of a nurse , physician , or personnel trained in emergency measures for at least 20 minutes following immunotherapy injection .
Patient must be instructed to report any adverse reactions that occur within 24 hours after injection .
Possible adverse reactions include unusual swelling and / or tenderness at injection site , rhinorrhea , sneezing , coughing , wheezing , shortness of breath , nausea , dizziness , or faintness .
Immediate medical attention must be sought for reactions that occur during or after leaving physician ’ s office .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Long term studies in animals have not been conducted with allergenic extract to determine their potential for carcinogenicity , mutagenicity or impairment of fertility .
Pregnancy Category C : Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with allergenic extracts .
It is not known whether allergenic extracts cause fetal harm during pregnancy or affect reproductive capacity .
A systemic reaction to allergenic extract could cause uterine contractions leading to spontaneous abortion or premature labor .
Allergenic extracts should be used during pregnancy only if potential benefit justifies potential risk to fetus . 11 Nursing Mothers : It is not known whether allergenic extracts are excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when allergenic extracts are administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use : Allergenic extracts have been used routinely in children , and no special safety problems or specific hazards have been found .
Children can receive the same dose as adults .
Discomfort is minimized by dividing the dose in half and administering injection at two different sites . 16 , 17 Drug Interactions : Antihistamines .
Antihistamines inhibit the wheal and flare reaction .
The inhibitory effect of conventional antihistamines varies from 1 day up to 10 days , according to the drug and patient ’ s sensitivity .
Long acting antihistamines ( e . g . , astemizole ) may inhibit the wheal and flare for up to forty days . 1 , 2 Imipramines , phenothiazines , and tranquilizers .
Tricyclic antidepressants exert a potent and sustained decrease of skin reactions to histamine .
This effect may last for a few weeks .
Tranquilizers and antiemetic agents of the phenothiazine class have H1 antihistaminic activity and can block skin tests . 1 Corticosteroids .
Short - term ( less than 1 week ) administration of corticosteroids at the therapeutic doses used in asthmatic patients does not modify the cutaneous reactivity to histamine , compound 48 / 80 , or allergen .
Long - term corticosteroid therapy modifies the skin texture and makes the interpretation of immediate skin tests more difficult . 1 Theophylline .
It appears that theophylline need not be stopped prior to skin testing . 1 Beta - Blockers .
Patients receiving beta - blockers may not be responsive to epinephrine or inhaled bronchodilators .
The following are commonly prescribed beta - blockers : Levatol , Lopressor , Propanolol Intersol , Propanolol HCL , Blocadren , Propanolol , Inderal - LA , Visken , Corgard , Ipran , Tenormin , Timoptic .
Ophthalmic beta - blockers : Betaxolol , Levobunolol , Timolol , Timoptic .
Chemicals that are beta - blockers and may be components of other drugs : Acebutolol , Atenolol , Esmolol , Metoprolol , Nadolol , Penbutolol , Pindolol , Propanolol , Timolol , Labetalol , Carteolol . 1 Beta - adrenergic agents .
Inhaled beta2 agonists in the usual doses used for the treatment of asthma do not usually inhibit allergen - induced skin tests .
However , oral terbutaline and parenteral ephedrine were shown to decrease the allergen - induced wheal . 1 Cromolyn .
Cromolyn inhaled or injected prior to skin tests with allergens or degranulating agents does not alter skin whealing response . 1 Other drugs .
Other drugs have been shown to decrease skin test reactivity .
Among them , dopamine is the best - documented compound . 1 Specific Immunotherapy .
A decreased skin test reactivity has been observed in patients undergoing specific immunotherapy with pollen extracts , grass pollen allergoids , mites , hymenoptera venoms , or in professional beekeepers who are spontaneously desensitized .
Finally , it was shown that specific immunotherapy in patients treated with ragweed pollen extract induced a decreased late - phase reaction . 1 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions include , but are not limited to urticaria ; itching ; edema of extremities ; respiratory wheezing or asthma ; dyspnea ; cyanosis ; tachycardia ; lacrimation ; marked perspiration ; flushing of face , neck or upper chest ; mild persistent clearing of throat ; hacking cough or persistent sneezing .
1 ) Local Reactions A mild burning immediately after injection is expected ; this usually subsides in 10 - 20 seconds .
Prolonged pain or pain radiating up arm is usually the result of intramuscular injection , making this injection route undesirable .
Subcutaneous injection is the recommended route .
Small amounts of erythema and swelling at the site of injection are common .
Reactions should not be considered significant unless they persist for at least 24 hours or exceed 50 mm in diameter .
Larger local reactions are not only uncomfortable , but indicate the possibility of a severe systemic reaction if dosage is increased .
In such cases dosage should be reduced to the last level not causing reaction and maintained for two or three treatments before cautiously increasing .
Large , persistent local reactions or minor exacerbations of the patient ’ s allergic symptoms may be treated by local cold applications and / or use of oral antihistamines .
2 ) Systemic Reactions Systemic reactions range from mild exaggeration of patient ’ s allergic symptoms to anaphylactic reactions . 14 Very sensitive patients may show a rapid response .
It cannot be overemphasized that , under certain unpredictable combinations of circumstances , anaphylactic shock is always a possibility .
Fatalities are rare but can occur . 5 Other possible systemic reaction symptoms are fainting , pallor , bradycardia , hypotension , angioedema , cough , wheezing , conjunctivitis , rhinitis , and urticaria . 13 , 14 Careful attention to dosage and administration limit such reactions .
Allergenic extracts are highly potent to sensitive individuals and OVERDOSE could result in anaphylactic symptoms .
Therefore , it is imperative that physicians administering allergenic extracts understand and prepare for treatment of severe reactions .
Refer to “ OVERDOSAGE ” section .
OVERDOSAGE Refer to “ WARNINGS ” , “ PRECAUTIONS ” and “ ADVERSE REACTIONS ” sections for signs and symptoms of an overdose .
If a systemic or anaphylactic reaction does occur , apply tourniquet above the site of allergenic extract injection and inject intramuscularly or subcutaneously 0 . 3 to 0 . 5 ml of 1 : 1000 Epinephrine - hydrochloride into the opposite arm or gluteal area .
Repeat dose in 5 - 10 minutes if necessary .
Loosen tourniquet briefly at 5 minute intervals to prevent circulatory impairment .
Discontinue use of the tourniquet after ½ hour .
The epinephrine HCL 1 : 1000 dose for infants to 2 years is 0 . 05 to 0 . 1 ml ; for children 2 to 6 years it is 0 . 15 ml ; for children 6 to 12 years it is 0 . 2 ml .
Symptoms of progressive anaphylaxis include airway obstruction and / or vascular collapse .
After administration of epinephrine , profound shock and vasomotor collapse should be treated with intravenous fluids and possibly vasoactive drugs .
Monitor airways for obstruction .
Oxygen should be given by mask if indicated .
Antihistamines , H2 antagonist , bronchodilators , steroids and theophylline may be used as indicated after providing adequate epinephrine and circulatory support . 4 Patients who have been taking beta - blockers may be unresponsive to epinephrine .
Epinephrine or beta - adrenergic drugs ( Alupent ) may be ineffective .
These drugs should be administered even though a beta - blocker may have been taken .
The following treatment will be effective whether or not patient is taking a beta - blocker : Aminophylline IV , slow push or drip , Atrovent ( Ipratropium bromide ) Inhaler , 3 inhalations repeated , Atropine , 0 . 4 mg / ml , 0 . 75 to 1 . 5 ml IM or IV , Solu - Cortef , 100 - 200 mg IM or IV , Solu - Medrol , 125 mg IM or IV , Glucagon , 0 . 5 - 1 mg IM or IV , Benadryl , 50 mg IM or IV , Cimetidine , 300 mg IM or IV , Oxygen via ambu bag .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Refer to “ STORAGE ” section for proper storage condition for allergenic extract .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
Some allergenic extracts naturally precipitate .
Physicians undertaking immunotherapy should be concerned with patient ’ s degree of sensitivity .
The initial dilution of allergenic extract , starting dose , and progression of dosage must be carefully determined on the basis of the patient ’ s history and results of skin tests .
Strongly positive skin tests may be risk factors for systemic reactions .
Less aggressive immunotherapy schedules may be indicated for such patients .
Precaution is necessary when using extract mixture for skin testing .
The diluting effect of individual components within a mixture may cause false negative reactions .
Patients extremely sensitive to a common allergen in several components of a mixture may be more likely to experience a systemic reaction than when skin tested individually for each component . 9 PRICK - PUNCTURE TESTING : To identify highly sensitive individuals and as a safety precaution , it is recommended that a prick - puncture test using a drop of the extract concentrate be performed prior to initiating very dilute intradermal testing .
Prick - puncture testing is performed by placing a drop of extract concentrate on the skin and puncturing the skin through the drop with a small needle such as a bifurcated vaccinating needle .
The most satisfactory sites on the back for skin testing are from the posterior axillary fold to 2 . 5 cm from the spinal column , and from the top of the scapula to the lower rib margins .
The best areas on the arms are the volar surfaces from the axilla to 2 . 5 or 5 cm above the wrist , skipping the anticubital space .
A positive reaction is approximately 10 - 15 mm erythema with 2 . 5 mm wheal .
Smaller , less conclusive reactions may be considered positive in conjunction with a definitive history of symptoms on exposure to the allergen .
The more sensitive the patient the higher the probability that he / she will have symptoms related to the exposure of the offending allergen .
Hence , the importance of a good patient history .
Less sensitive individuals can be tested intradermally with an appropriately diluted extract .
A positive control using histamine phosphate identifies patients whose skin may not react due to medications , metabolic or other reasons .
A negative control ( 50 % glycerine for prick - puncture testing ) would exclude false - positive reactions due to ingredients in diluent or patients who have dermatographism .
SINGLE DILUTION INTRADERMAL TESTING : The surface of the upper and lower arm is the usual location for skin testing .
It is important that a new , sterile , disposable syringe and needle be used for each extract tested .
Intracutaneous test dilutions , five - fold or ten - fold , may be prepared from stock concentrate using physiologic saline as a diluent .
( 1 ) Start testing with the most dilute allergenic extract concentration .
( 2 ) A volume of 0 . 02 - 0 . 05 ml should be injected slowly into the superficial skin layers making a small bleb ( superficial wheal ) .
( 3 ) For patients without a history of extreme sensitivity , or a negative or weakly reactive prick - puncture test , the initial dilution for skin testing should be a dilution at least 1 : 12 , 500 w / v .
This initial dilution can be prepared by diluting 1 : 20 to 1 : 50 w / v ( 2 % - 5 % ) extracts five - fold to 5 - 4 or 1 : 10 w / v ( 10 % ) extracts to 5 - 5 .
See “ Serial Dilutions Titration Test Dilutions ” chart on the next page .
Dilute 1 : 10 w / v ( 10 % ) extracts to 10 - 3 if using ten - fold dilutions .
( 4 ) Sensitive patients with a positive prick - puncture test require a further dilution to at least 1 : 312 , 500 w / v .
This dilution can be prepared by diluting 1 : 20 to 1 : 50 w / v ( 2 % - 5 % ) extracts to 5 - 6 or 1 : 10 w / v ( 10 % ) extracts to 5 - 7 ( five - fold dilutions ) .
Ten - fold dilution to 10 - 6 of a 1 : 10 w / v ( 10 % ) extract would be a safe starting dilution .
Size of reactions are quantitated based on size of wheal and erythema .
For interpretation of skin reactions , refer to chart below .
If after 20 minutes no skin reaction is observed , continue testing using increasing increments of the concentration until a reaction of 5 - 10 mm wheal and 11 - 30 mm erythema is obtained , or a concentration of 5 - 2 or 10 - 1 has been tested .
A negative control , 50 % glycerine diluted with diluent to 5 - 2 ( 1 : 25 ) or 10 - 1 ( 1 : 10 ) dilution and a positive control of histamine phosphate , should be tested and included in interpretation of skin reactions . 1 , 13 GRADE mm ERYTHEMA mm WHEAL 0 less than 5 less than 5 ± 5 - 10 5 - 10 1 + 11 - 20 5 - 10 2 + 21 - 30 5 - 10 3 + 31 - 40 10 - 15 or with pseudopods 4 + greater than 40 greater than 15 or with many pseudopods INTRADERMAL TESTING - SKIN ENDPOINT TITRATION : The allergenic extracts to which the patient is sensitive , the patient ’ s degree of sensitivity and the dose of allergen to be used in immunotherapy can be determined through the use of intracutaneous skin tests involving progressive five - fold dilutions of allergenic extracts .
Intracutaneously inject 0 . 01 to 0 . 02 ml of the test allergen to form a 4 mm diameter superficial skin wheal .
For patients demonstrating a negative or weakly reactive prick - puncture skin test , an initial screening dilution of 1 : 12 , 500 w / v is safe .
For patients demonstrating a positive prick - puncture skin test , an initial screening dilution of 1 : 312 , 500 w / v is safe .
( See “ Serial Dilution Titration Test Dilutions ” chart below . )
When a sequence of five - fold or ten - fold dilutions of an allergen are injected , the endpoint is determined by noting the dilution that first produces a wheal and erythema ( 15 minutes after injection ) that is 2 mm larger than wheals with erythema produced by weaker , non - reacting dilutions ( 5 mm negative wheal ) .
The endpoint dilution is used as a starting dose concentration for immunotherapy .
An endpoint dose of 0 . 15 ml is a safe initial dose to be followed by escalation to the optimal maximum tolerated dose for each individual .
Injections should never be given intravenously .
A 5 / 8 inch , 25 gauge needle on a sterile syringe will allow deep subcutaneous injection .
IMMUNOTHERAPY : If the first injection of the initial dilution of extract is tolerated without significant local reaction , increasing doses by 5 - 20 % increments of that dilution may be administered .
The rate of increase in dosage in the early stages of treatment with highly diluted extracts is usually more rapid than the rate of increase possible with more concentrated extracts .
This schedule is intended only as a guide and must be modified according to the reactivity of the individual patient .
Needless to say , the physician must proceed cautiously in the treatment of the highly sensitive patient who develops large local or systemic reactions . 6 Some patients may tolerate larger doses of the allergenic extract depending on patient response . 7 Because diluted extract tends to lose activity in storage , the first dose from a more concentrated vial should be the same , or less than , the previous dose . 8 , 12 Dosages progressively increase according to the tolerance of the patient at intervals of one to seven days until , ( 1 ) the patient achieves relief from symptoms , ( 2 ) induration at the site of injection is no larger than 50 mm in 36 to 48 hours , ( 3 ) a maintenance dose is reached ( the largest dose tolerated by the patient that relieves symptoms without undesirable local or systemic reactions ) .
This maintenance dose may be continued at regular intervals perennially .
It may be necessary to adjust the progression of dosage downward to avoid local and constitutional reactions .
The usual duration of treatment has not been established .
A period of two or three years on immunotherapy constitutes an average minimum course of treatment .
