1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE DIANEAL peritoneal dialysis solutions are indicated for patients in acute or chronic renal failure .
For management of acute or chronic renal failure .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intraperitoneal administration only .
( 2 ) 2 . 1 Basic Dosing Information DIANEAL peritoneal dialysis solutions are intended for intraperitoneal administration only .
Not for intravenous or intra - arterial administration ..
Select mode of therapy , frequency of treatment , formulation , fill volume , duration of dwell , and length of dialysis based on the patient ’ s clinical condition , fluid , electrolyte and specific needs .
The fill volume depends on body size , usually from 2 . 0 to 2 . 5 liters per 1 . 73m2 for adults .
DIANEAL peritoneal dialysis solutions are intended for use in Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis ( CAPD ) or Automated Peritoneal Dialysis ( APD ) .
Refer to directions accompanying ancillary equipment for CAPD and APD system preparation .
Product Selection To avoid the risk of severe dehydration and hypovolemia and to minimize the loss of protein , it is advisable to select the peritoneal dialysis solution with the lowest level of osmolarity consistent with the fluid removal requirements for that exchange .
As the patient ’ s body weight becomes closer to the ideal dry weight , lowering the dextrose concentration of DIANEAL solution is recommended .
DIANEAL 4 . 25 % dextrose - containing solution has the highest osmolarity of the DIANEAL solutions and using it for all exchanges may cause dehydration [ see Dosage Forms and Strengths ( 3 ) ] .

Exposure to temperatures above 25 ° C / 77 ° F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content .
Higher temperatures lead to greater losses .
It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period .
The amount of water that can permeate from inside the solution container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period , e . g . di - 2 - ethylhexyl phthalate ( DEHP ) , up to 5 parts per million ; however , the safety of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers as well as by cell culture toxicity studies .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action DIANEAL peritoneal dialysis solutions are a pharmacologically inactive , hypertonic peritoneal dialysis solution containing dextrose , a monosaccharide , as the primary osmotic agent .
An osmotic gradient must be created between the peritoneal membrane and the dialysis solution in order for ultrafiltration to occur .
The hypertonic concentration of glucose in DIANEAL solutions exert an osmotic pressure across the peritoneal membrane resulting in transcapillary ultrafiltration .
Like other peritoneal dialysis solutions , DIANEAL solutions contain electrolytes to facilitate the correction of electrolyte abnormalities .
DIANEAL solutions contain a buffer , lactate , to help normalize acid - base abnormalities .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Glucose is rapidly absorbed from the peritoneal cavity by diffusion and appears quickly in the circulation due to the high glucose concentration gradient between DIANEAL solutions compared to blood capillary glucose level .
Absorption per unit time will be the highest at the start of an exchange and decreases over time .
The rate of glucose absorption will be dependent upon the transport characteristics of the patient ’ s peritoneal membrane as determined by a peritoneal equilibration test ( PET ) .
Glucose absorption will also depend upon the concentration of glucose used for the exchange and the length of the dwell .
Transport of other molecules will be dependent upon the molecular size of the solute , the concentration gradient , and the effective peritoneal surface area as determined by the PET .
Metabolism and Elimination Glucose is metabolized by normal cellular pathways ( i . e . , glycolysis ) .
Metabolism of lactate occurs in the liver and results in the generation of the bicarbonate .
Glucose not absorbed during PD exchange procedure is removed by drainage of the PD solution from the peritoneal cavity .
Drug Interaction Studies Heparin No human drug interaction studies with heparin were conducted .
In vitro studies demonstrated no evidence of incompatibility of heparin with DIANEAL solutions .
Antibiotics No formal clinical drug interaction studies have been performed .
In vitro studies of the following medications have demonstrated stability with DIANEAL solutions : amphotericin B , ampicillin , cefazolin , cefepime , cefotaxime , ceftazidime , ceftriaxone , ciprofloxacin , clindamycin , deferoxamine , erythromycin , gentamicin , linezolid , mezlocillin , miconazole , moxifloxacin , nafcillin , ofloxacin , penicillin G , piperacillin , sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim , ticarcillin , tobramycin , and vancomycin .
However , aminoglycosides should not be mixed with penicillins due to chemical incompatibility .
