Caution should be exercised when prescribing COSENTYX to patients with inflammatory bowel disease .
( 5 . 3 ) • Hypersensitivity Reactions : If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs , discontinue COSENTYX immediately and initiate appropriate therapy .
( 5 . 4 ) • Immunizations : Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with COSENTYX .
( 5 . 6 ) 5 . 1 Infections COSENTYX may increase the risk of infections .
In clinical trials , a higher rate of infections was observed in COSENTYX treated subjects compared to placebo - treated subjects .
In placebo - controlled clinical trials in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis , higher rates of common infections , such as nasopharyngitis ( 11 . 4 % versus 8 . 6 % ) , upper respiratory tract infection ( 2 . 5 % versus 0 . 7 % ) and mucocutaneous infections with candida ( 1 . 2 % versus 0 . 3 % ) were observed with COSENTYX compared with placebo .
A similar increase in risk of infection was seen in placebo - controlled trials in subjects with PsA , AS and nr - axSpA .
The incidence of some types of infections appeared to be dose - dependent in clinical studies [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In the postmarketing setting , serious and some fatal infections have been reported in patients receiving COSENTYX .
Exercise caution when considering the use of COSENTYX in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection .
Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur .
If a patient develops a serious infection , monitor the patient closely and discontinue COSENTYX until the infection resolves .
5 . 2 Pre - Treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis Evaluate patients for tuberculosis ( TB ) infection prior to initiating treatment with COSENTYX .
Avoid administration of COSENTYX to patients with active TB infection .
Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering COSENTYX .
Consider anti - TB therapy prior to initiation of COSENTYX in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed .
Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment .
5 . 3 Inflammatory Bowel Disease Caution should be used when prescribing COSENTYX to patients with inflammatory bowel disease .
Exacerbations , in some cases serious , occurred in COSENTYX treated subjects during clinical trials in plaque psoriasis , PsA , AS and nr - axSpA .
In addition , new onset inflammatory bowel disease cases occurred in clinical trials with COSENTYX .
In an exploratory trial in 59 subjects with active Crohn ’ s disease , there were trends toward greater disease activity and increased adverse events in the secukinumab group as compared to the placebo group .
Patients who are treated with COSENTYX should be monitored for signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylaxis and cases of urticaria occurred in COSENTYX treated subjects in clinical trials .
If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs , administration of COSENTYX should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 5 Risk of Hypersensitivity in Latex - Sensitive Individuals The removable caps of the COSENTYX Sensoready pen and the COSENTYX 1 mL and 0 . 5 mL prefilled syringes contain natural rubber latex , which may cause an allergic reaction in latex - sensitive individuals .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Adult Plaque Psoriasis A total of 3430 plaque psoriasis subjects were treated with COSENTYX in controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials .
Of these , 1641 subjects were exposed for at least 1 year .
Four placebo - controlled Phase 3 trials in plaque psoriasis subjects were pooled to evaluate the safety of COSENTYX in comparison to placebo up to 12 weeks after treatment initiation , in Trials PsO1 , PsO2 , PsO3 , and PsO4 .
In total , 2077 subjects were evaluated ( 691 to COSENTYX 300 mg group , 692 to COSENTYX 150 mg group , and 694 to placebo group ) .
Subjects randomized to COSENTYX received 300 mg or 150 mg doses subcutaneously at Weeks 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 followed by the same dose every 4 weeks [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Table 2 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1 % and at a higher rate in the COSENTYX groups than the placebo group during the 12 - week placebo - controlled period of the placebo - controlled trials .

Infections In the placebo - controlled period of the clinical trials in plaque psoriasis ( a total of 1382 subjects treated with COSENTYX and 694 subjects treated with placebo up to 12 weeks ) , infections were reported in 28 . 7 % of subjects treated with COSENTYX compared with 18 . 9 % of subjects treated with placebo .
Serious infections occurred in 0 . 14 % of subjects treated with COSENTYX and in 0 . 3 % of subjects treated with placebo .
Over the entire treatment period ( a total of 3430 plaque psoriasis subjects treated with COSENTYX for up to 52 weeks for the majority of subjects ) , infections were reported in 47 . 5 % of subjects treated with COSENTYX ( 0 . 9 per patient - year of follow - up ) .
Serious infections were reported in 1 . 2 % of subjects treated with COSENTYX ( 0 . 015 per patient - year of follow - up ) .
Phase 3 data showed an increasing trend for some types of infection with increasing serum concentration of secukinumab .
Candida infections , herpes viral infections , staphylococcal skin infections , and infections requiring treatment increased as serum concentration of secukinumab increased .
In the psoriasis open - label extension of Trials PsO1 and PsO2 ( median follow - up of 3 . 9 years ) , representing 3582 subject - years of exposure , 74 % of COSENTYX treated subjects reported infections ( 55 per 100 patient - years ) .
Serious infections were reported in 4 . 5 % of subjects ( 1 . 4 per 100 patient - years ) .
Sepsis was reported in 5 subjects ( 0 . 2 per 100 patient - years ) .
Neutropenia was observed in controlled portion of clinical trials .
Most cases of secukinumab - associated neutropenia were transient and reversible .
No serious infections were associated with cases of neutropenia .
In the open - label extension of Trials PsO1 and PsO2 , neutropenia ( ANC < 1 x109 / L ) was reported in 1 % of COSENTYX treated subjects ( 0 . 3 per 100 patient - years ) .
Some cases of serious infections were associated with neutropenia ; however the causal relationship was not established .
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Cases of inflammatory bowel disease , in some cases serious , were observed in clinical trials with COSENTYX .
In the plaque psoriasis program , with 3430 subjects exposed to COSENTYX over the entire treatment period for up to 52 weeks ( 2725 patient - years ) , there were 3 cases ( 0 . 11 per 100 patient - years ) of exacerbation of Crohn ’ s disease , 2 cases ( 0 . 08 per 100 patient - years ) of exacerbation of ulcerative colitis , and 2 cases ( 0 . 08 per 100 patient - years ) of new onset ulcerative colitis .
There were no cases in placebo subjects ( N = 793 ; 176 patient - years ) during the 12 - week placebo - controlled period .
One case of exacerbation of Crohn ’ s disease was reported in open - labeled portions of clinical trials in plaque psoriasis .
Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylaxis and cases of urticaria occurred in COSENTYX treated subjects in clinical trials [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Pediatric Plaque Psoriasis The safety of COSENTYX was assessed in two Phase 3 trials in pediatric subjects with plaque psoriasis .
The first was a randomized , double - blind , placebo and active - controlled , 236 - week trial ( Trial PsO6 ) that enrolled 162 pediatric subjects 6 years of age and older , with severe plaque psoriasis ( defined by PASI score ≥ 20 , an IGA modified 2011 score of 4 , and involving ≥ 10 % of the body surface area ) who were candidates for systemic therapy .
The 162 subjects were randomized to receive placebo , a biologic active control , or COSENTYX .
In the COSENTYX groups , subjects with body weight < 25 kg received 75 mg , subjects with body weight 25 to < 50 kg received either 75 mg or 150 mg ( 2 times the recommended dose ) , and subjects with body weight ≥ 50 kg received either 150 mg or 300 mg ( 2 times the recommended dose ) .
The second trial was a randomized , open - label , 208 - week trial ( Trial PsO7 ; NCT03668613 ) of 84 subjects 6 years of age and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis ( defined by a PASI score ≥ 12 , IGA mod 2011 score of ≥ 3 , and BSA involvement of ≥ 10 % at randomization ) who were randomized into two COSENTYX arms [ Arm 1 : 75 mg for body weight ( BW ) < 50 kg or 150 mg for ≥ 50 kg and Arm 2 : 75 mg for BW < 25 kg , 150 mg for BW ≥ 25 kg and < 50 kg , or 300 mg for BW ≥ 50 kg ] .
The safety profile reported in these trials was consistent with the safety profile reported in adult plaque psoriasis trials .
Infections One case of methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) toxic shock syndrome ( TSS ) was reported in a COSENTYX treated subject during the placebo - controlled period .
In the pediatric safety pool , which includes all subjects who took at least one dose of COSENTYX during the treatment periods [ 198 subjects ( 287 patient years ) ] , 22 ( 11 % ) subjects reported ≥ CTCAE Grade 2 neutropenia ( ≥ 1 , 000 to < 1 , 500 cells / mm3 ) with 57 % of subjects followed for one year or more and 30 % of subjects followed for two years or more .
During the placebo - controlled period which included a total of 80 subjects treated with secukinumab and 41 subjects treated with placebo up to 12 weeks , ≥ CTCAE Grade 2 neutropenia was reported in 3 ( 4 % ) of the subjects treated with secukinumab compared with no subjects treated with placebo .
No serious infections were associated with cases of neutropenia .
Adult Psoriatic Arthritis COSENTYX was studied in two placebo - controlled PsA trials with 1003 patients ( 703 patients on COSENTYX and 300 patients on placebo ) .
Of the 703 patients who received COSENTYX , 299 patients received a subcutaneous loading dose of COSENTYX ( PsA1 ) and 404 patients received an intravenous loading dose of secukinumab ( PsA2 ) followed by COSENTYX administered by subcutaneous injection every four weeks .
During the 16 - week placebo - controlled period of the trials in patients with PsA , the overall proportion of patients with adverse events was similar in the secukinumab and placebo - treatment groups ( 59 % and 58 % , respectively ) .
The adverse events that occurred at a proportion of at least 2 % and at a higher proportion in the COSENTYX groups than the placebo groups during the 16 - week placebo - controlled period were nasopharyngitis , upper respiratory tract infection , headache , nausea , and hypercholesterolemia .
The safety profile observed in patients with PsA treated with COSENTYX is consistent with the safety profile in psoriasis .
Similar to the clinical trials in patients with psoriasis , there was an increased proportion of patients with infections in the COSENTYX groups ( 29 % ) compared to placebo group ( 26 % ) .
There were cases of Crohn ’ s disease and ulcerative colitis that include patients who experienced either exacerbations or the development of new disease .
There were three cases of inflammatory bowel disease , of which two patients received secukinumab and one received placebo .
Ankylosing Spondylitis COSENTYX was studied in two placebo - controlled AS trials with 590 patients ( 394 patients on COSENTYX and 196 patients on placebo ) .
Of the 394 patients who received COSENTYX , 145 patients received a subcutaneous load of COSENTYX ( study AS1 ) , and 249 received an intravenous loading dose of secukinumab ( study AS2 ) followed by COSENTYX administered by subcutaneous injection every four weeks .
During the 16 - week placebo - controlled period of the trials in patients with AS , the overall proportion of patients with adverse events was higher in the secukinumab groups than the placebo - treatment groups ( 66 % and 59 % , respectively ) .
The adverse events that occurred at a proportion of at least 2 % and at a higher proportion in the COSENTYX groups than the placebo groups during the 16 - week placebo - controlled period were nasopharyngitis , nausea , and upper respiratory tract infection .
The safety profile observed in patients with ankylosing spondylitis treated with COSENTYX is consistent with the safety profile in psoriasis .
In a third controlled study of AS ( study AS3 ) , the safety profile of the 300 mg dose of COSENTYX was consistent with the safety profile of the 150 mg dose of COSENTYX .
Similar to clinical trials in patients with psoriasis , there was an increased proportion of patients with infections in the COSENTYX groups ( 31 % ) compared to the placebo group ( 18 % ) .
In the original AS program , with 571 patients exposed to COSENTYX there were 8 cases of inflammatory bowel disease during the entire treatment period [ 5 Crohn ’ s ( 0 . 7 per 100 patient - years ) and 3 ulcerative colitis ( 0 . 4 per 100 patient - years ) ] .
During the placebo - controlled 16 - week period , there were 2 Crohn ’ s disease exacerbations and 1 new onset ulcerative colitis case that was a serious adverse event in patients treated with COSENTYX compared to none of the patients treated with placebo .
During the remainder of the study when all patients received COSENTYX , 1 patient developed Crohn ’ s disease , 2 patients had Crohn ’ s exacerbations , 1 patient developed ulcerative colitis , and 1 patient had an ulcerative colitis exacerbation .
Non - Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis COSENTYX was studied in one randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled nr - axSpA trial with 555 patients ( 185 patients on with load COSENTYX , 184 patients on without load COSENTYX and 186 patients on placebo ) .
The safety profile for patients with nr - axSpA treated with COSENTYX was overall similar to the safety profile seen in patients with AS and other previous experience with COSENTYX .
Patients in nr - axSpA1 study who received the loading dosing regimen compared to those without the loading regimen , had higher incidence of infections and infestations ( 92 per 100 patient - years vs 72 per 100 patient years ) , including nasopharyngitis , upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection , and gastrointestinal disorders ( 27 per 100 patient - years vs 22 per 100 patient - years ) , including gastritis , lower abdominal pain , colitis , diarrhea , and hematochezia .
Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis and Enthesitis - Related Arthritis COSENTYX was studied in one double - blind , placebo - controlled , event - driven , randomized trial in 86 pediatric patients aged 2 to < 18 years old with Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis ( JPsA ) and ERA .
The safety profile reported in this study was consistent with the safety profile of secukinumab .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is the potential for immunogenicity .
The immunogenicity of COSENTYX was evaluated using an electrochemiluminescence - based bridging immunoassay .
Less than 1 % of subjects treated with COSENTYX developed antibodies to secukinumab in up to 52 weeks of treatment .
However , this assay has limitations in detecting anti - secukinumab antibodies in the presence of secukinumab ; therefore , the incidence of antibody development might not have been reliably determined .
Of the subjects who developed antidrug antibodies , approximately one - half had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing .
Neutralizing antibodies were not associated with loss of efficacy .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors , including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of incidence of antibodies to COSENTYX with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS CYP450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes can be altered by increased levels of certain cytokines ( e . g . , IL - 1 , IL - 6 , IL - 10 , TNFα , IFN ) during chronic inflammation .
Upon initiation or discontinuation of COSENTYX in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates , particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index , consider monitoring for therapeutic effect or drug concentration and consider dosage adjustment of the CYP450 substrate as needed [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available human data with COSENTYX use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug - associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes .
In an embryo - fetal development study , no adverse developmental effects were observed in infants born to pregnant monkeys after subcutaneous administration of secukinumab during organogenesis at doses up to 30 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) ( see Data ) .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown ; however , the background risk in the U . S . general population of major birth defects is 2 % to 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 % to 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
Data Animal Data An embryo - fetal development study was performed in cynomolgus monkeys with secukinumab .
No malformations or embryo - fetal toxicity were observed in fetuses from pregnant monkeys that were administered secukinumab weekly by the subcutaneous route during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 30 times the MRHD ( on a mg / kg basis at a maternal dose of 150 mg / kg ) .
A pre - and post - natal development toxicity study was performed in mice with a murine analog of secukinumab .
No treatment - related effects on functional , morphological or immunological development were observed in fetuses from pregnant mice that were administered the murine analog of secukinumab on gestation days 6 , 11 , and 17 and on postpartum days 4 , 10 , and 16 at doses up to 150 mg / kg / dose .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether secukinumab is excreted in human milk or absorbed systemically after ingestion .
There are no data on the effects of COSENTYX on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for COSENTYX and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from COSENTYX or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of COSENTYX have been established in pediatric subjects aged 6 years and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Safety and effectiveness of COSENTYX in pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis below the age of 6 years have not been established .
The safety and effectiveness of COSENTYX have been established in patients weighing 15 kg or more with JPsA ( 2 years and older ) and ERA ( 4 years and older ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 6 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of COSENTYX in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years and with body weight less than 15 kg have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 3430 plaque psoriasis subjects exposed to COSENTYX in clinical trials , a total of 230 were 65 years or older , and 32 subjects were 75 years or older .
Although no differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older and younger subjects , the number of subjects aged 65 years and older was not sufficient to determine whether they responded differently from younger subjects .
10 OVERDOSAGE Doses up to 30 mg / kg intravenously have been administered in clinical trials without dose - limiting toxicity .
In the event of overdosage , it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted immediately .
11 DESCRIPTION Secukinumab , a recombinant human monoclonal IgG1 / κ antibody , is an interleukin - 17 A antagonist .
It is expressed in a recombinant Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cell line .
Secukinumab has a molecular mass of approximately 151 kDa ; both heavy chains of secukinumab contain oligosaccharide chains .
COSENTYX Injection COSENTYX injection is a sterile , preservative - free , clear to slightly opalescent , colorless to slightly yellow solution for subcutaneous use .
COSENTYX is supplied in a single - dose Sensoready pen with a 27 - gauge fixed ½ - inch needle , or a single - dose prefilled syringe with a 27 - gauge fixed ½ - inch needle .
The removable cap of the COSENTYX Sensoready pen or prefilled syringe contains natural rubber latex .
Each COSENTYX Sensoready pen or prefilled syringe contains 150 mg of secukinumab formulated in : L - histidine / histidine hydrochloride monohydrate ( 3 . 103 mg ) , L - methionine ( 0 . 746 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 0 . 2 mg ) , trehalose dihydrate ( 75 . 67 mg ) , and Sterile Water for Injection , USP , at pH of 5 . 8 .
Each COSENTYX 75 mg / 0 . 5 mL prefilled syringe contains 75 mg of secukinumab formulated in : L - histidine / histidine hydrochloride monohydrate ( 1 . 552 mg ) , L - methionine ( 0 . 373 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 0 . 1 mg ) , trehalose dihydrate ( 37 . 83 mg ) , and Sterile Water for Injection , USP , at pH of 5 . 8 .
COSENTYX for Injection COSENTYX for injection is supplied as a sterile , preservative free , white to slightly yellow , lyophilized powder in single - dose vials for subcutaneous use after reconstitution .
Each COSENTYX vial contains 150 mg of secukinumab formulated in L - histidine / histidine hydrochloride monohydrate ( 4 . 656 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 0 . 6 mg ) , and sucrose ( 92 . 43 mg ) .
Following reconstitution with 1 mL Sterile Water for Injection , USP , the resulting pH is approximately 5 . 8 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Secukinumab is a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the interleukin - 17 A ( IL - 17 A ) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with the IL - 17 receptor .
IL - 17 A is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses .
Secukinumab inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Elevated levels of IL - 17 A are found in psoriatic plaques .
Treatment with COSENTYX may reduce epidermal neutrophils and IL - 17 A levels in psoriatic plaques .
Serum levels of total IL - 17 A ( free and secukinumab - bound IL - 17 A ) measured at Week 4 and Week 12 were increased following secukinumab treatment .
These pharmacodynamic activities are based on small exploratory studies .
The relationship between these pharmacodynamic activities and the mechanism ( s ) by which secukinumab exerts its clinical effects is unknown .
Increased numbers of IL - 17 A producing lymphocytes and innate immune cells and increased levels of IL - 17 A have been found in the blood of patients with PsA and AS .
Increased numbers of IL - 17 A producing lymphocytes have also been found in patients with nr - axSpA .
Immune Response to Non - Live Vaccines During Treatment Healthy individuals who received a single 150 mg dose of COSENTYX 2 weeks prior to vaccination with a non - U . S . approved group C meningococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine and a non - U . S . approved inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine had similar antibody responses compared to individuals who did not receive COSENTYX prior to vaccination .
The clinical effectiveness of meningococcal and influenza vaccines has not been assessed in patients undergoing treatment with COSENTYX [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic ( PK ) properties of secukinumab observed in PsA , AS and nr - axSpA patients were similar to the PK properties displayed in plaque psoriasis patients .
Absorption Following a single subcutaneous dose of either 150 mg ( one - half the recommended dose ) or 300 mg in plaque psoriasis subjects , secukinumab reached peak mean ( ± SD ) serum concentrations ( Cmax ) of 13 . 7 ± 4 . 8 mcg / mL and 27 . 3 ± 9 . 5 mcg / mL , respectively , by approximately 6 days post dose .
Following multiple subcutaneous doses of secukinumab , the mean ( ± SD ) serum trough concentrations of secukinumab ranged from 22 . 8 ± 10 . 2 mcg / mL ( 150 mg ) to 45 . 4 ± 21 . 2 mcg / mL ( 300 mg ) at Week 12 .
At the 300 mg dose at Week 4 and Week 12 , the mean trough concentrations resulted from the Sensoready pen were 23 % to 30 % higher than those from the lyophilized powder and 23 % to 26 % higher than those from the prefilled syringe based on cross - study comparisons .
Steady - state concentrations of secukinumab were achieved by Week 24 following the every 4 - week dosing regimens .
The mean ( ± SD ) steady - state trough concentrations ranged from 16 . 7 ± 8 . 2 mcg / mL ( 150 mg ) to 34 . 4 ± 16 . 6 mcg / mL ( 300 mg ) .
In healthy subjects and subjects with plaque psoriasis , secukinumab bioavailability ranged from 55 % to 77 % following subcutaneous dose of 150 mg ( one - half the recommended dose ) or 300 mg .
Distribution The mean volume of distribution during the terminal phase ( Vz ) following a single intravenous administration ranged from 7 . 10 to 8 . 60 L in plaque psoriasis subjects .
Intravenous use is not recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Secukinumab concentrations in interstitial fluid in lesional and non - lesional skin of plaque psoriasis subjects ranged from 27 % to 40 % of those in serum at 1 and 2 weeks after a single subcutaneous dose of secukinumab 300 mg .
Elimination Metabolism The metabolic pathway of secukinumab has not been characterized .
As a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody secukinumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG .
Excretion The mean systemic clearance ( CL ) ranged from 0 . 14 L / day to 0 . 22 L / day and the mean half - life ranged from 22 to 31 days in plaque psoriasis subjects following intravenous and subcutaneous administration across all psoriasis trials .
Intravenous use is not recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Dose Linearity Secukinumab exhibited dose - proportional pharmacokinetics in subjects with psoriasis over a dose range from 25 mg ( approximately 0 . 083 times the recommended dose ) to 300 mg following subcutaneous administrations .
Weight Secukinumab clearance and volume of distribution increase as body weight increases .
Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment No formal trial of the effect of hepatic or renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of secukinumab was conducted .
Geriatric Patients Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the clearance of secukinumab was not significantly influenced by age in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis , PsA and AS .
Subjects who are 65 years or older had apparent clearance of secukinumab similar to subjects less than 65 years old .
Pediatric Patients In a pool of the two pediatric trials , subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis ( 6 years of age and older ) were administered secukinumab at the recommended pediatric dosing regimen .
At Week 24 , secukinumab steady state mean ± SD serum trough concentrations were 32 . 6 ± 10 . 8 mcg / mL ( n = 8 ) , 19 . 8 ± 6 . 96 mcg / mL ( n = 24 ) , and 27 . 3 ± 10 . 1 mcg / mL ( n = 36 ) , in subjects weighing < 25 kg and receiving 75 mg of secukinumab , subjects weighing ≥ 25 and < 50 kg and receiving 75 mg of secukinumab , and subjects weighing ≥ 50 kg and receiving 150 mg of secukinumab , respectively .
In a pediatric study , JPsA and ERA patients ( 2 to less than 18 years of age ) were administered secukinumab at the recommended pediatric dosing regimen .
At Week 24 , patients weighing ≥ 15 kg and < 50 kg , and patients weighing ≥ 50 kg had a mean ± SD steady - state trough concentration of 25 . 2 ± 5 . 45 mcg / mL ( n = 10 ) and 27 . 9 ± 9 . 57 mcg / mL ( n = 19 ) , respectively .
Drug Interactions Cytochrome P450 Substrates In adult subjects with plaque psoriasis , midazolam ( CYP3A4 substrate ) pharmacokinetics was similar when administered alone , or when administered following either a single or five weekly subcutaneous administrations of 300 mg secukinumab [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of COSENTYX .
Some published literature suggests that IL - 17 A directly promotes cancer cell invasion in vitro , whereas other reports indicate IL - 17 A promotes T - cell mediated tumor rejection .
Depletion of IL - 17 A with a neutralizing antibody inhibited tumor development in mice .
The relevance of experimental findings in mouse models for malignancy risk in humans is unknown .
No effects on fertility were observed in male and female mice that were administered a murine analog of secukinumab at subcutaneous doses up to 150 mg / kg once weekly prior to and during the mating period .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Adult Plaque Psoriasis Four multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials ( Trials PsO1 , PsO2 , PsO3 , and PsO4 ) enrolled 2403 subjects ( 691 randomized to COSENTYX 300 mg , 692 to COSENTYX 150 mg , 694 to placebo , and 323 to a biologic active control ) 18 years of age and older with plaque psoriasis who had a minimum body surface area involvement of 10 % , and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ( PASI ) score greater than or equal to 12 , and who were candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy .
• Trial PsO1 ( NCT01365455 ) enrolled 738 subjects ( 245 randomized to COSENTYX 300 mg , 245 to COSENTYX 150 mg , and 248 to placebo ) .
Subjects received subcutaneous treatment at Weeks 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 followed by dosing every 4 weeks .
Subjects randomized to COSENTYX received 300 mg or 150 mg doses at Weeks 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 followed by the same dose every 4 weeks .
Subjects randomized to receive placebo that were non - responders at Week 12 were then crossed over to receive COSENTYX ( either 300 mg or 150 mg ) at Weeks 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , and 16 followed by the same dose every 4 weeks .
All subjects were followed for up to 52 weeks following first administration of study treatment .
• Trial PsO2 ( NCT01358578 ) enrolled 1306 subjects ( 327 randomized to COSENTYX 300 mg , 327 to COSENTYX 150 mg , 326 to placebo , and 323 to a biologic active control ) .
COSENTYX and placebo data are described .
Subjects received subcutaneous treatment at Weeks 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 followed by dosing every 4 weeks .
Subjects randomized to COSENTYX received 300 mg or 150 mg doses at Weeks 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 followed by the same dose every 4 weeks .
Subjects randomized to receive placebo that were non - responders at Week 12 then crossed over to receive COSENTYX ( either 300 mg or 150 mg ) at Weeks 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , and 16 followed by the same dose every 4 weeks .
All subjects were followed for up to 52 weeks following first administration of study treatment .
• Trial PsO3 ( NCT01555125 ) enrolled 177 subjects ( 59 randomized to COSENTYX 300 mg , 59 to COSENTYX 150 mg , and 59 to placebo ) and assessed safety , tolerability , and usability of COSENTYX self - administration via prefilled syringe for 12 weeks .
Subjects received subcutaneous treatment at Weeks 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , followed by the same dose every 4 weeks for up to 12 weeks total .
• Trial PsO4 ( NCT01636687 ) enrolled 182 subjects ( 60 randomized to COSENTYX 300 mg , 61 to COSENTYX 150 mg , and 61 to placebo ) and assessed safety , tolerability , and usability of COSENTYX self - administration via Sensoready pen for 12 weeks .
Subjects received subcutaneous treatment at Weeks 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , followed by the same dose every 4 weeks for up to 12 weeks total .
Endpoints In all trials , the endpoints were the proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in PASI score of at least 75 % ( PASI 75 ) from baseline to Week 12 and treatment success ( clear or almost clear ) on the Investigator ’ s Global Assessment modified 2011 ( IGA ) .
Other evaluated outcomes included the proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in PASI score of at least 90 % ( PASI 90 ) from baseline at Week 12 , maintenance of efficacy to Week 52 , and improvements in itching , pain , and scaling at Week 12 based on the Psoriasis Symptom Diary © .
The PASI is a composite score that takes into consideration both the percentage of body surface area affected and the nature and severity of psoriatic changes within the affected regions ( induration , erythema and scaling ) .
The IGA is a 5 - category scale , including “ 0 = clear ” , “ 1 = almost clear ” , “ 2 = mild ” , “ 3 = moderate ” or “ 4 = severe ” indicating the physician ’ s overall assessment of the psoriasis severity focusing on induration , erythema and scaling .
Treatment success of “ clear ” or “ almost clear ” consisted of no signs of psoriasis or normal to pink coloration of lesions , no thickening of the plaque , and none to minimal focal scaling .
Baseline Characteristics Across all treatment groups the baseline PASI score ranged from 11 to 72 with a median of 20 and the baseline IGA score ranged from “ moderate ” ( 62 % ) to “ severe ” ( 38 % ) .
Of the 2077 plaque psoriasis subjects who were included in the placebo - controlled trials , 79 % were biologic - naïve ( have never received a prior treatment with biologics ) and 45 % were non - biologic failures ( failed to respond to a prior treatment with non - biologic therapies ) .
Of the subjects who received a prior treatment with biologics , over one - third were biologic failures .
Approximately 15 % to 25 % of trial subjects had a history of psoriatic arthritis .

Based on post - hoc sub - group analyses in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis , subjects with lower body weight and lower disease severity may achieve an acceptable response with COSENTYX 150 mg .
PASI 90 response at Week 12 was achieved with COSENTYX 300 mg and 150 mg compared to placebo in 59 % ( 145 / 245 ) and 39 % ( 95 / 245 ) versus 1 % ( 3 / 248 ) of subjects , respectively ( Trial PsO1 ) and 54 % ( 175 / 327 ) and 42 % ( 137 / 327 ) versus 2 % ( 5 / 326 ) of subjects , respectively ( Trial PsO2 ) .
Similar results were seen in Trials PsO3 and PsO4 .
With continued treatment over 52 weeks , subjects in Trial PsO1 who were PASI 75 responders at Week 12 maintained their responses in 81 % ( 161 / 200 ) of the subjects treated with COSENTYX 300 mg and in 72 % ( 126 / 174 ) of subjects treated with COSENTYX 150 mg .
Trial PsO1 subjects who were clear or almost clear on the IGA at Week 12 also maintained their responses in 74 % ( 119 / 160 ) of subjects treated with COSENTYX 300 mg and in 59 % ( 74 / 125 ) of subjects treated with COSENTYX 150 mg .
Similarly in Trial PsO2 , PASI 75 responders maintained their responses in 84 % ( 210 / 249 ) of subjects treated with COSENTYX 300 mg and in 82 % ( 180 / 219 ) of subjects treated with COSENTYX 150 mg .
Trial PsO2 subjects who were clear or almost clear on the IGA also maintained their responses in 80 % ( 161 / 202 ) of subjects treated with COSENTYX 300 mg and in 68 % ( 113 / 167 ) of subjects treated with COSENTYX 150 mg .
Among the subjects who chose to participate ( 39 % ) in assessments of patient reported outcomes , improvements in signs and symptoms related to itching , pain , and scaling , at Week 12 compared to placebo ( Trials PsO1 and PsO2 ) were observed using the Psoriasis Symptom Diary © .
Psoriasis Lesions of Scalp A randomized , placebo - controlled trial ( Trial PsO5 ; NCT02267135 ) enrolled 102 subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis lesions of scalp , defined as having a Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index ( PSSI ) score of greater than or equal to 12 , an IGA scalp only score of 3 or greater , and at least 30 % of the scalp affected .
In this trial , 62 % of subjects had at least 50 % of scalp surface area affected .
The proportions of subjects achieving an IGA scalp only score of 0 or 1 ( clear or almost clear ) were 56 . 9 % and 5 . 9 % for the COSENTYX 300 mg and the placebo groups , respectively .
14 . 2 Pediatric Plaque Psoriasis A 52 - week , multicenter randomized , double - blind , placebo and active - controlled trial ( Trial PsO6 ; NCT02471144 ) enrolled 162 pediatric subjects 6 years of age and older , with severe plaque psoriasis ( as defined by a PASI score ≥ 20 , an IGA modified 2011 score of 4 , and involving ≥ 10 % of the body surface area ) who were candidates for systemic therapy .
Subjects were randomized to receive placebo , COSENTYX , or a biologic active control .
In the COSENTYX groups , subjects with body weight < 25 kg received 75 mg , subjects with body weight 25 to < 50 kg received either 75 mg or 150 mg ( 2 times the recommended dose ) , and subjects with body weight ≥ 50 kg received either 150 mg or 300 mg ( 2 times the recommended dose ) .
Subjects in the COSENTYX and placebo groups received treatment at Weeks 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 followed by dosing every 4 weeks .
At Week 12 , subjects randomized to placebo who were non - responders were switched to COSENTYX ( dose based on body weight ) and received COSENTYX at Weeks 12 , 13 , 14 , and 15 , followed by the same dose every 4 weeks starting at Week 16 .
Overall , 60 % of the subjects were female , 83 % were Caucasian , the median body weight was 50 . 6 kg , and the mean age was 13 . 5 years with 23 % of the subjects < 12 years .
At baseline , the median PASI score was 26 ( ranged from 17 to 60 ) , and 99 % of the subjects had an IGA modified 2011 score of 4 ( ‘ severe ’ ) .
Approximately 43 % of the subjects had prior exposure to phototherapy , 53 % to conventional systemic therapy , 3 % to biologics , and 9 % had concomitant psoriatic arthritis .
The co - primary endpoints were the proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in PASI score of at least 75 % ( PASI 75 ) from baseline to Week 12 and the proportion of subjects who achieved an IGA modified 2011 score of ‘ clear ’ or ‘ almost clear ’ ( 0 or 1 ) with at least a 2 - point improvement from baseline to Week 12 .
The key secondary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved a reduction in PASI score of at least 90 % ( PASI 90 ) from baseline to Week 12 .

Patients in these studies had a diagnosis of PsA of at least 5 years across all studies .
At baseline , over 61 % and 42 % of the patients had enthesitis and dactylitis , respectively .
Overall , 31 % of patients discontinued previous treatment with anti - TNFα agents due to either lack of efficacy or intolerance .
In addition , approximately 53 % of patients from both studies had concomitant methotrexate ( MTX ) use .
Patients with different subtypes of PsA were enrolled , including polyarticular arthritis with no evidence of rheumatoid nodules ( 80 % ) , asymmetric peripheral arthritis ( 63 % ) , distal interphalangeal involvement ( 58 % ) , spondylitis with peripheral arthritis ( 20 % ) and arthritis mutilans ( 7 % ) .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 6 Juvenile Psoriatic Arthritis and Enthesitis - Related Arthritis The efficacy and safety of secukinumab were assessed in 86 patients in a two year , 3 - part , double - blind , placebo - controlled , event - driven , randomized , Phase 3 study ( NCT03031782 ) in patients 2 to < 18 years of age with active ERA or JPsA as diagnosed based on a modified International League of Associations for Rheumatology ( ILAR ) Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis ( JIA ) classification criteria .
The study consisted of an open - label portion ( Part 1 ) followed by randomized withdrawal ( Part 2 ) followed by open - label treatment ( Part 3 ) .
The JIA patient subtypes at study entry were : 60 . 5 % ERA and 39 . 5 % JPsA .
In the study 67 . 6 % of patients with JPsA , and 63 . 5 % of patients with ERA , were treated concomitantly with MTX .
Patients were given a dose of 75 mg if weighing < 50 kg , or 150 mg if weighing ≥ 50 kg .
The primary endpoint was time to flare in Part 2 .
Disease flare was defined as a ≥ 30 % worsening in at least three of the six JIA ACR response criteria and ≥ 30 % improvement in not more than one of the six JIA ACR response criteria and a minimum of two active joints .
In open - label Part 1 , all patients received secukinumab until Week 12 .
Patients classified as responders ( achieving JIA ACR30 response ) at Week 12 entered into the Part 2 double - blind phase and were randomized 1 : 1 to continue treatment with secukinumab or begin treatment with placebo .
Similar responses were seen in each JIA subtype ( JPsA and ERA ) .
The JIA ACR 30 , 50 , 70 and 90 responses for patients with JPsA and ERA at Week 12 are presented below in Table 13 .
