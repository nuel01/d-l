Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : sunburn , blister ( including vesicles and bullae ) , pruritus , hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available pharmacovigilance data with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel , 0 . 3 % / 2 . 5 % use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination gel .
Adapalene gel , 0 . 3 % Available data from clinical trials with adapalene gel 0 . 3 % use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of adapalene to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at dose exposures 41 and 81 times , respectively , the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 2 g resulted in fetal skeletal and visceral malformations ( see Data ) .
Benzoyl peroxide gel , 2 . 5 % The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown .
Based on published literature , benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid ( an endogenous substance ) , which is eliminated in the urine .
Hence , maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure of the drug .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data No malformations were observed in rats treated with oral adapalene doses of 0 . 15 to 5 . 0 mg / kg / day , up to 8 times the MRHD of 2 grams of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel , 0 . 3 % / 2 . 5 % based on a mg / m2 comparison .
However , malformations were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of ≥ 25 mg / kg / day adapalene ( 41 and 81 times the MRHD , respectively , based on a mg / m2 comparison ) .
Findings included cleft palate , microphthalmia , encephalocele , and skeletal abnormalities in rats and umbilical hernia , exophthalmos , and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits .
Dermal adapalene embryofetal development studies in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6 . 0 mg / kg / day ( 9 . 7 and 19 . 5 times the MRHD , respectively , based on a mg / m2 comparison ) exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in skeletal variations ( supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Adapalene gel , 0 . 3 % There are no data on the presence of adapalene topical gel or its metabolite in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
In animal studies , adapalene is present in rat milk with oral administration of the drug .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
It is possible that topical administration of large amounts of adapalene could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
Benzoyl peroxide gel , 2 . 5 % The systemic exposure of benzoyl peroxide is unknown .
Based on the published literature , benzoyl peroxide is rapidly metabolized to benzoic acid ( an endogenous substance ) , which is eliminated in the urine .
Any amount of benzoyl peroxide excreted into human milk by a nursing mother would be expected to be rapidly metabolized by tissue and stomach esterases .
There are no data on the presence of benzoyl peroxide in human milk , its effects on the breastfed infant or its effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel , 0 . 3 % / 2 . 5 % and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel , 0 . 3 % / 2 . 5 % or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations To minimize potential exposure to the breastfed infant via breastmilk , use Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel , 0 . 3 % / 2 . 5 % on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest duration possible while breastfeeding .
Advise breastfeeding women not to apply Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel , 0 . 3 % / 2 . 5 % directly to the nipple and areola to avoid direct infant exposure .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel , 0 . 3 % / 2 . 5 % in pediatric patients under the age of 12 have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel , 0 . 3 % / 2 . 5 % did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein .
Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation , keratinization and inflammatory processes .
However , the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown .
Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel , 0 . 3 % / 2 . 5 % is unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic trial was conducted in 26 adult and adolescent subjects ( 12 to 33 years of age ) with severe acne vulgaris who were treated with once - daily applications during a 4 - week period with , on average , 2 . 3 grams / day ( range 1 . 6 - 3 . 1 grams / day ) of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel , 0 . 3 % / 2 . 5 % applied as a thin layer to the face , shoulders , upper chest , and upper back .
After a 4 - week treatment , 16 subjects ( 62 % ) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification of 0 . 1 ng / mL , with a mean Cmax of 0 . 16 ± 0 . 08 ng / mL and a mean AUC0 - 24 hr of 2 . 49 ± 1 . 21 ng . h / mL .
The most exposed subject had adapalene Cmax and AUC0 - 24 hr of 0 . 35 ng / mL and 6 . 41 ng . h / mL , respectively .
Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route .
Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine .
Drug Interactions No formal drug - drug interaction studies were conducted with Adapalene and Benzoyl Peroxide Topical Gel , 0 . 3 % / 2 . 5 % .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity , genotoxicity , or fertility studies were conducted with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel , 0 . 3 % / 2 . 5 % .
Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene were conducted in mice at topical doses of 0 . 4 , 1 . 3 , and 4 . 0 mg / kg / day ( 1 . 2 , 3 . 9 , 12 mg / m2 / day ) , and in rats at oral doses of 0 . 15 , 0 . 5 , and 1 . 5 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 9 , 3 . 0 , and 9 . 0 mg / m2 / day ) .
The highest dose levels are 3 . 2 ( mice ) and 2 . 4 ( rats ) times the MRHD of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel , 0 . 3 % / 2 . 5 % based on a mg / m2 comparison .
In the rat study , an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas reported in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed .
No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15 - 25 % benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel ( 6 - 10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel , 0 . 3 % / 2 . 5 % ) for two years .
Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 ( males ) and 205 ( females ) mg / kg benzoyl peroxide ( 27 - 40 times the MRHD based on a mg / m2 comparison ) .
Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25 % benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15 % benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for rest of the 2 year study period , and in mice topically treated with 5 % benzoyl peroxide carbopol gel for two years .
Benzoyl peroxide is a tumor promoter in several animal species .
The significance of this finding in humans is unknown .
Adapalene was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro ( Ames test , Chinese hamster ovary cell assay , or mouse lymphoma TK assay ) or in vivo ( mouse micronucleus test ) .
Benzoyl peroxide caused DNA strand breaks and DNA - protein cross - links in mammalian cells , increased sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells , and was mutagenic in a few , but not all , in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assays ( Ames tests ) conducted .
In rat oral studies , 20 mg / kg / day adapalene ( 32 times the MRHD based on a mg / m2 comparison ) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F0 males and females or the growth , development or reproductive function of F1 offspring .
No fertility studies were conducted with benzoyl peroxide .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel , 0 . 3 % / 2 . 5 % applied once daily for 12 weeks for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in a multicenter , randomized , double - blind , vehicle - controlled trial , comparing adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel , 0 . 3 % / 2 . 5 % to vehicle gel in subjects with acne vulgaris .
The trial also evaluated adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel , 0 . 1 % / 2 . 5 % , a lower strength product than adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel , 0 . 3 % / 2 . 5 % .
In this trial , 217 subjects were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide topical gel , 0 . 3 % / 2 . 5 % , 217 subjects with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide gel , 0 . 1 % / 2 . 5 % and 69 subjects with the vehicle gel .
Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who were rated “ clear ” or “ almost clear ” at Week 12 with at least a two - grade improvement based on the Investigator ’ s Global Assessment ( IGA ) , and mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in both inflammatory and non - inflammatory lesion counts .
An IGA score of ‘ Clear ’ corresponded to clear skin with no inflammatory or non - inflammatory lesions .
An IGA score of “ almost clear ” corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules .
At baseline , 50 % of subjects were graded as “ moderate ” ( IGA Grade 3 ) and 50 % were graded as “ severe ” ( IGA Grade 4 ) on the IGA scale .
Subjects had an average of 98 ( range 51 - 226 ) total lesions of which the mean number of inflammatory lesions was 38 ( range : 20 - 99 ) and the mean number of non - inflammatory lesions was 60 ( range 30 - 149 ) .
Subjects ranged in age from 12 to 57 years , with 273 ( 54 % ) of subjects 12 to 17 years of age .
Approximately equal number of males ( 48 % ) and females ( 52 % ) were enrolled .
The IGA success rate , mean reduction , and percent reduction in acne lesion counts from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment are presented in the following table .
