The efficacy and safety of this ratio of intravenous and oral MESNEX has not been established as being effective for daily doses of ifosfamide higher than 2 g / m2 .
Patients who vomit within two hours of taking oral MESNEX should repeat the dose or receive intravenous MESNEX .
2 . 3 Monitoring for Hematuria Maintain adequate hydration and sufficient urinary output , as required for ifosfamide treatment , and monitor urine for the presence of hematuria .
If severe hematuria develops when MESNEX is given according to the recommended dosage schedule , dosage reductions or discontinuation of ifosfamide therapy may be required .
2 . 4 Preparation for Intravenous Administration and Stability Preparation Determine the volume of MESNEX injection for the intended dose .
Dilute the volume of MESNEX injection for the dose in any of the following fluids to obtain a final concentration of 20 mg / mL : • • 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP • • 5 % Dextrose and 0 . 2 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP • • 5 % Dextrose and 0 . 33 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP • • 5 % Dextrose and 0 . 45 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP • • 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP • • Lactated Ringer ’ s Injection , USP Stability The MESNEX injection multidose vials may be stored and used for up to 8 days after initial puncture .
Store diluted solutions at 25 ° C ( 77 ° F ) .
Use diluted solutions within 24 hours .
Do not mix MESNEX injection with epirubicin , cyclophosphamide , cisplatin , carboplatin , and nitrogen mustard .
The benzyl alcohol contained in MESNEX injection vials can reduce the stability of ifosfamide .
Ifosfamide and MESNEX may be mixed in the same bag provided the final concentration of ifosfamide does not exceed 50 mg / mL .
Higher concentrations of ifosfamide may not be compatible with MESNEX and may reduce the stability of ifosfamide .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit .
Any solutions which are discolored , hazy , or contain visible particulate matter should not be used .

Discontinue MESNEX and provide supportive care .
5 . 2 Dermatologic Toxicity Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and bullous and ulcerative skin and mucosal reactions , consistent with Stevens - Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis have occurred .
MESNEX may cause skin and mucosal reactions characterized by urticaria , rash , erythema , pruritus , burning sensation , angioedema , periorbital edema , flushing and stomatitis .
These reactions may occur with the first exposure or after several months of exposure .
Discontinue MESNEX and provide supportive care .
5 . 3 Benzyl Alcohol Toxicity Benzyl alcohol , a preservative in MESNEX , has been associated with serious adverse reactions and death ( including gasping syndrome ) in neonates , premature , and low - birth weight infants .
The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known .
Consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources when prescribing MESNEX ( 10 . 4 mg benzyl alcohol per mL ) .
Neonates , premature , and low - birth weight infants , as well as patients receiving high dosages , may be more likely to develop toxicity .
Monitor patients for signs or symptoms of toxicity .
Avoid use in neonates , premature , and low - birth weight infants [ See Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 4 Laboratory Test Interferences False - Positive Urine Tests for Ketone Bodies A false positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with MESNEX when using nitroprusside sodium - based urine tests ( including dipstick tests ) .
The addition of glacial acetic acid can be used to differentiate between a false positive result ( cherry - red color that fades ) and a true positive result ( red - violet color that intensifies ) .
False - Negative Tests for Enzymatic CPK Activity MESNEX may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase ( CPK ) activity tests that use a thiol compound ( e . g . , N - acetylcysteine ) for CPK reactiviation .
This may result in a falsely low CPK level .
False - Positive Tests for Ascorbic Acid MESNEX may cause false - positive reactions in Tillman ’ s reagent - based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid .
5 . 5 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds MESNEX is a thiol compound , i . e . , a sulfhydryl ( SH ) group - containing organic compound .

• • Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Dermatological Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • • Benzyl AlcoholToxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • • Laboratory Test Interferences [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • • Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] The most common adverse reactions ( > 10 % ) when MESNEX is given with ifosfamide are nausea , vomiting , constipation , leukopenia , fatigue , fever , anorexia , thrombocytopenia , anemia , granulocytopenia , diarrhea , asthenia , abdominal pain , headache , alopecia , and somnolence .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Baxter Healthcare at 1 - 866 - 888 - 2472 , or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
MESNEX adverse reaction data are available from four Phase 1 studies in which single intravenous doses of 600 - 1200 mg MESNEX Injection without concurrent chemotherapy were administered to a total of 53 healthy volunteers and single oral doses of 600 - 2400 mg of MESNEX Tablets were administered to a total of 82 healthy volunteers .
The most frequently reported side effects ( observed in two or more healthy volunteers ) for healthy volunteers receiving single doses of MESNEX Injection alone were headache , injection site reactions , flushing , dizziness , nausea , vomiting , somnolence , diarrhea , anorexia , fever , pharyngitis , hyperesthesia , influenza - like symptoms , and coughing .
In two Phase 1 multiple - dose studies where healthy volunteers received MESNEX Tablets alone or intravenous MESNEX followed by repeated doses of MESNEX Tablets , flatulence and rhinitis were reported .
In addition , constipation was reported by healthy volunteers who had received repeated doses of intravenous MESNEX .
Additional adverse reactions in healthy volunteers receiving MESNEX alone included injection site reactions , abdominal pain / colic , epigastric pain / burning , mucosal irritation , lightheadedness , back pain , arthralgia , myalgia , conjunctivitis , nasal congestion , rigors , paresthesia , photophobia , fatigue , lymphadenopathy , extremity pain , malaise , chest pain , dysuria , pleuritic pain , dry mouth , dyspnea , and hyperhidrosis .
In healthy volunteers , MESNEX was commonly associated with a rapid ( within 24 hours ) decrease in lymphocyte count , which was generally reversible within one week of administration .
Because MESNEX is used in combination with ifosfamide or ifosfamide - containing chemotherapy regimens , it is difficult to distinguish the adverse reactions which may be due to MESNEX from those caused by the concomitantly administered cytotoxic agents .
Adverse reactions reasonably associated with MESNEX administered intravenously and orally in four controlled studies in which patients received ifosfamide or ifosfamide - containing regimens are presented in .

[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported in the postmarketing experience of patients receiving MESNEX in combination with ifosfamide or similar drugs , making it difficult to distinguish the adverse reactions which may be due to MESNEX from those caused by the concomitantly administered cytotoxic agents .
Because these reactions are reported from a population of unknown size , precise estimates of frequency cannot be made .
Cardiovascular : Hypertension Gastrointestinal : Dysgeusia Hepatobiliary : Hepatitis Nervous System : Convulsion Respiratory : Hemoptysis 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No clinical drug interaction studies have been conducted with MESNEX .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Pregnancy : Use only if clearly needed .
( 8 . 1 ) • • Nursing mothers : Women should not breastfeed during therapy .
( 8 . 3 ) • • Geriatric use : Dose selection should be cautious .
( 8 . 5 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B Risk Summary There are no studies of MESNEX in pregnant women .
Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses approximately 10 times the maximum recommended total daily intravenous - oral - oral human dose on a body surface area basis ( 1000 mg / kg in rabbits and 2000 mg / kg in rats ) revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mesna .
The incidence of malformations in human pregnancies has not been established for MESNEX .
All pregnancies , regardless of drug exposure , have a background rate of 2 to 4 % for major malformations and 15 to 20 % for pregnancy loss .
Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether mesna or dimesna is excreted in human milk .
Benzyl alcohol present in maternal serum is likely to cross into human milk and may be orally absorbed by a nursing infant .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from MESNEX , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of MESNEX in pediatric patients have not been established .
MESNEX contains benzyl alcohol ( 10 . 4 mg benzyl alcohol per mL ) which has been associated with serious adverse reactions and death in pediatric patients .
The " gasping syndrome , " ( characterized by central nervous system depression , metabolic acidosis and gasping respirations ) has been associated with benzyl alcohol dosages > 99 mg / kg / day in neonates , premature , and low - birth weight infants .
Additional symptoms may include gradual neurological deterioration , seizures , intracranial hemorrhage , hematologic abnormalities , skin breakdown , hepatic and renal failure , hypotension , bradycardia , and cardiovascular collapse .
The minimum amount of benzyl alcohol at which toxicity may occur is not known .
Neonates , premature , and low - birth weight infants , as well as patients receiving high dosages , may be more likely to develop toxicity .
Practitioners administering this and other medications containing benzyl alcohol should consider the combined daily metabolic load of benzyl alcohol from all sources [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of MESNEX did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
The ratio of ifosfamide to MESNEX should remain unchanged .
8 . 6 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of MESNEX .
8 . 7 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of MESNEX .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known antidote for MESNEX .
In a clinical trial , 11 patients received intravenous MESNEX 10 mg / kg to 66 mg / kg per day for 3 to 5 days .
Patients also received ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide .
Adverse reactions included nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and fever .
An increased rate of these adverse reactions has also been found in oxazaphosphorine - treated patients receiving ≥ 80 mg MESNEX per kg per day intravenously compared with patients receiving lower doses or hydration treatment only .
Postmarketing , administration of 4 . 5 g to 6 . 9 g of MESNEX resulted in hypersensitivity reactions including mild hypotension , shortness of breath , asthma exacerbation , rash , and flushing .
11 DESCRIPTION MESNEX is a detoxifying agent to inhibit the hemorrhagic cystitis induced by ifosfamide .
The active ingredient , mesna , is a synthetic sulfhydryl compound designated as sodium - 2 - mercaptoethane sulfonate with a molecular formula of C2H5NaO3S2 and a molecular weight of 164 . 18 .
Its structural formula is as follows : HS – CH2 – CH2SO3 – Na + MESNEX ( mesna ) injection is a sterile , nonpyrogenic , aqueous solution of clear and colorless appearance in clear glass multidose vials for intravenous administration .
MESNEX injection contains 100 mg / mL mesna , 0 . 25 mg / mL edetate disodium and sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment .
MESNEX Injection multidose vials also contain 10 . 4 mg / mL of benzyl alcohol as a preservative .
The solution has a pH range of 7 . 5 - 8 . 5 .
MESNEX ( mesna ) tablets are white , oblong , scored biconvex film - coated tablets with the imprint M4 .
They contain 400 mg mesna .
The excipients are calcium phosphate , cornstarch , hydroxypropylmethylcellulose , lactose , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose , polyethylene glycol , povidone , simethicone , and titanium dioxide .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Mesna reacts chemically with the urotoxic ifosfamide metabolites , acrolein and 4 - hydroxy - ifosfamide , resulting in their detoxification .
The first step in the detoxification process is the binding of mesna to 4 ‑ hydroxy - ifosfamide forming a non - urotoxic 4 - sulfoethylthioifosfamide .
Mesna also binds to the double bonds of acrolein and to other urotoxic metabolites and inhibits their effects on the bladder .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration , peak plasma concentrations were reached within 1 . 5 to 4 hours and 3 to 7 hours for free mesna and total mesna ( mesna plus dimesna and mixed disulfides ) , respectively .
Oral bioavailability averaged 58 % ( range 45 to 71 % ) for free mesna and 89 % ( range 74 to 104 % ) for total mesna based on plasma AUC data from 8 healthy volunteers who received 1200 mg oral or intravenous doses .
Food does not affect the urinary availability of orally administered MESNEX .
Distribution Mean apparent volume of distribution ( Vd ) for mesna is 0 . 652 ± 0 . 242 L / kg after intravenous administration which suggests distribution to total body water ( plasma , extracellular fluid , and intracellular water ) .
Metabolism Analogous to the physiological cysteine - cystine system , mesna is rapidly oxidized to its major metabolite , mesna disulfide ( dimesna ) .
Plasma concentrations of mesna exceed those of dimesna after oral or intravenous administration .
Excretion Following intravenous administration of a single 800 mg dose , approximately 32 % and 33 % of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours as mesna and dimesna , respectively .
Mean plasma elimination half - lives of mesna and dimesna are 0 . 36 hours and 1 . 17 hours , respectively .
Mesna has a plasma clearance of 1 . 23 L / h / kg .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No long - term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of mesna .
Mesna was not genotoxic in the in vitro Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay , the in vitro mammalian lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay or the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
No studies on male or female fertility were conducted .
No signs of male or female reproductive organ toxicity were seen in 6 - month oral rat studies ( ≤ 2000 mg / kg / day ) or 29 - week oral dog studies ( 520 mg / kg / day ) at doses approximately 10 - fold higher than the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Intravenous MESNEX Hemorrhagic cystitis produced by ifosfamide is dose dependent ( Table 4 ) .
At a dose of 1 . 2 g / m2 ifosfamide administered daily for 5 days , 16 to 26 % of the patients who received conventional uroprophylaxis ( high fluid intake , alkalinization of the urine , and the administration of diuretics ) developed hematuria ( > 50 RBC per hpf or macrohematuria ) ( Studies 1 , 2 , and 3 ) .
In contrast , none of the patients who received mesna injection together with this dose of ifosfamide developed hematuria ( Studies 3 and 4 ) .
In two randomized studies , ( Studies 5 and 6 ) , higher doses of ifosfamide , from 2 g / m2 to 4 g / m2 administered for 3 to 5 days , produced hematuria in 31 to 100 % of the patients .
When MESNEX was administered together with these doses of ifosfamide , the incidence of hematuria was less than 7 % .
