OVERDOSAGE Clinically apparent signs and symptoms of an overdose of Tobramycin ophthalmic solution ( punctate keratitis , erythema , increased lacrimation , edema and lid itching ) may be similar to adverse reaction effects seen in some patients .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION In mild to moderate disease , instill one or two drops into the affected eye ( s ) every four hours .
