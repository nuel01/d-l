FOLATE REGULATION The term " folate " are B vitamins that include folic acid and any forms of active pteroylglutamates regardless of the reduction state of the molecule .
Folates , or vitamin B9 , are primarily hydrolyzed in the intestinal jejunum and the liver to the active circulating form of folate , I - methylfolate , with an intermediate stable form , 5 , 10 - methylenetetrahydrofolate .
Folic acid , including the reduced forms [ 1 ] such as folinic acid , may obscure pernicious anemia above 0 . 1 mg doses , and must be administered under the supervision of a licensed medical practitioner .
The 1971 , 1972 , 1973 , 1980 , 1984 , 2000 , and 2010 Federal Register Notices addressed this concern while establishing that increased folate was proper therapy in megaloblastic anemias - specifically where homocysteine levels were elevated or risk of neural tube defects ( NTDs ) was at issue .
The Federal Register Notice of August 2 , 1973 ( 38 FR 20750 ) specifically states that : Dietary supplement preparations are available without a prescription ( 21 CFR 121 . 1134 ) .
Levels higher than dietary supplement amounts are available only with a prescription .
Folic acid - including reduced forms , may be added to medical foods as defined in section 5 ( b ) ( 3 ) of the Orphan Drug Act ( 21 USC 360 ee ( b ) ( 3 ) ) , or to food ( 21 CFR 172 . 345 ) .
[ 1 ] This product is a dietary supplement that - due to increased folate levels ( AUG 3 1973 FR 20750 ) , requires an Rx on the label because of increased risk associated with masking of vitamin B12 deficiency .
As such , this product requires licensed medical supervision , an Rx status , and a National Drug Code ( NDC ) as required by pedigree reporting requirements .

PATIENT INFORMATION Viva ® CT Prenatal Chewable is a prescription PRENATAL / POSTNATAL vitamin to be used only under licensed medical supervision .
DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs which may interact with folate include : • Antiepileptic drugs ( AED ) : The AED class including , but not limited to , phenytoin , carbamazepine , primidone , valproic acid , fosphenytoin , valproate , phenobarbital and lamotrigine have been shown to impair folate absorption and increase the metabolism of circulating folate .
• Additionally , concurrent use of folic acid has been associated with enhanced phenytoin metabolism , lowering the level of the AED in the blood and allowing breakthrough seizures to occur .
Caution should be used when prescribing this product among individuals who are receiving treatment with phenytoin and other anticonvulsants .
• Capecitabine : Folinic acid ( 5 - formyltetrahydrofolate ) may increase the toxicity of Capecitabine .
• Cholestyramine : Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels .
• Colestipol : Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels .
• Cycloserine : Reduces folic acid absorption and reduces serum folate levels .
• Dihydrofolate Reductase Inhibitors ( DHFRI ) : DHFRIs block the conversion of folic acid to its active forms , and lower plasma and red blood cell folate levels .
DHFRIs include aminopterin , methotrexate , pyrimethamine , triamterene , and trimethoprim .
• Fluoxetine : Fluoxetine exerts a noncompetitive inhibition of the 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate active transport in the intestine .
• Isotretinoin : Reduced folate levels have occurred in some individuals taking isotretinoin .
• L - dopa , triamterene , colchicine , and trimethoprim may decrease plasma folate levels .
• Nonsteroidal Anti - inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) : NSAIDs have been shown to inhibit some folate dependent enzymes in laboratory experiments .
• NSAIDs include ibuprofen , naproxen , indomethacin and sulindac .
• Oral Contraceptives : Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy .
• Methylprednisolone : Reduced serum folate levels have been noted after treatment with methylprednisolone .
• Pancreatic Enzymes : Reduced folate levels have occurred in some individuals taking pancreatic extracts , such as pancreatin and pancrelipase .
• Pentamidine : Reduced folate levels have been seen with prolonged intravenous pentamidine .
• Pyrimethamine : High levels of folic acid may result in decreased serum levels of pyrimethamine .
• Smoking and Alcohol : Reduced serum folate levels have been noted .
• Sulfasalazine : Inhibits the absorption and metabolism of folic acid .
• Metformin treatment in individuals with type 2 diabetes decreases serum folate .
• Warfarin can produce significant impairment in folate status after a 6 - month therapy .
• Heme - iron : Can compete for transport and reduce folate absorption .
Ensure adequate medical supervision to ensure proper iron levels .
• Folinic acid may enhance the toxicity of fluorouracil .
• Concurrent administration of chloramphenicol and folinic acid in folate - deficient patients may result in antagonism of the haematopoietic response to folate .
• Caution should be exercised with the concomitant use of folinic acid and trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole for the acute treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection as it is associated with increased rates of treatment failure and mortality in a placebo controlled study .
** Folate is a broad term that includes folic acid and all reduced forms including I - methylfolate and folinic acid .
Viva ® CT Prenatal Chewable does not contain I - methylfolate or folinic acid but these warnings are included as general folate information .
Drugs which interact with vitamin B6 : • Vitamin B6 should not be given to individuals receiving the drug levodopa because the action of levodopa is antagonized by vitamin B6 .
However , vitamin B6 may be used concurrently in individuals receiving a preparation containing both carbidopa and levodopa .
Drugs which may interact with vitamin B12 : • Antibiotics , cholestyramine , colchicines , colestipol , metformin , para - aminosalicylic acid , and potassium chloride may decrease the absorption of vitamin B12 .
• Nitrous oxide can produce a functional vitamin B12 deficiency .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folate .
Paresthesia , somnolence , nausea , and headaches have been reported with vitamin B6 .
Mild transient diarrhea , polycythemia vera , itching , transitory exanthema and the feeling of swelling of the entire body have been associated with vitamin B12 .
