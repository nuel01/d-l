( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B virus infection after discontinuation : Monitor hepatic function closely for at least several months .
( 5 . 1 , 6 . 1 ) • Co - infection with HIV : Entecavir is not recommended unless the patient is also receiving HAART .
( 5 . 2 ) • Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis : If suspected , treatment should be suspended .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Severe Acute Exacerbations of Hepatitis B Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who have discontinued anti - hepatitis B therapy , including entecavir [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow - up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti - hepatitis B therapy .
If appropriate , initiation of anti - hepatitis B therapy may be warranted .
5 . 2 Patients Co - infected with HIV and HBV Entecavir has not been evaluated in HIV / HBV co - infected patients who were not simultaneously receiving effective HIV treatment .
Limited clinical experience suggests there is a potential for the development of resistance to HIV nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors if entecavir is used to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection in patients with HIV infection that is not being treated [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
Therefore , therapy with entecavir is not recommended for HIV / HBV co - infected patients who are not also receiving HAART .
Before initiating entecavir therapy , HIV antibody testing should be offered to all patients .
Entecavir has not been studied as a treatment for HIV infection and is not recommended for this use .
5 . 3 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis , including fatal cases , have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogue inhibitors , including entecavir , alone or in combination with antiretrovirals .
A majority of these cases have been in women .
Obesity and prolonged nucleoside inhibitor exposure may be risk factors .
Particular caution should be exercised when administering nucleoside analogue inhibitors to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease ; however , cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors .
Lactic acidosis with entecavir use has been reported , often in association with hepatic decompensation , other serious medical conditions , or drug exposures .
Patients with decompensated liver disease may be at higher risk for lactic acidosis .
Treatment with entecavir should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity ( which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations ) .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling : • Exacerbations of hepatitis after discontinuation of treatment [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
• Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
• Most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 3 % , all severity grades ) are headache , fatigue , dizziness , and nausea .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Accord Healthcare Inc , at 1 - 866 - 941 - 7875 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch 6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience in Adults Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Compensated Liver Disease Assessment of adverse reactions is based on four studies ( AI463014 , AI463022 , AI463026 , and AI463027 ) in which 1720 subjects with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and compensated liver disease received double - blind treatment with entecavir 0 . 5 mg / day ( n = 679 ) , entecavir 1 mg / day ( n = 183 ) , or lamivudine ( n = 858 ) for up to 2 years .
Median duration of therapy was 69 weeks for entecavir - treated subjects and 63 weeks for lamivudine - treated subjects in Studies AI463022 and AI463027 and 73 weeks for entecavir - treated subjects and 51 weeks for lamivudine - treated subjects in Studies AI463026 and AI463014 .
The safety profiles of entecavir and lamivudine were comparable in these studies .
The most common adverse reactions of any severity ( ≥ 3 % ) with at least a possible relation to study drug for entecavir - treated subjects were headache , fatigue , dizziness , and nausea .
The most common adverse reactions among lamivudine - treated subjects were headache , fatigue , and dizziness .
One percent of entecavir - treated subjects in these four studies compared with 4 % of lamivudine - treated subjects discontinued for adverse events or abnormal laboratory test results .
Clinical adverse reactions of moderate - severe intensity and considered at least possibly related to treatment occurring during therapy in four clinical studies in which entecavir was compared with lamivudine are presented in Table 3 .

[ 6 ] Grade 3 = 3 + , large ; Grade 4 = ≥ 4 + , marked , severe , many .
ULN = upper limit of normal .
Among entecavir - treated subjects in these studies , on - treatment ALT elevations greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) and greater than 2 times baseline generally resolved with continued treatment .
A majority of these exacerbations were associated with a ≥ 2 log 10 / mL reduction in viral load that preceded or coincided with the ALT elevation .
Periodic monitoring of hepatic function is recommended during treatment .
Exacerbations of Hepatitis after Discontinuation of Treatment An exacerbation of hepatitis or ALT flare was defined as ALT greater than 10 times ULN and greater than 2 times the subject ’ s reference level ( minimum of the baseline or last measurement at end of dosing ) .
For all subjects who discontinued treatment ( regardless of reason ) , Table 5 presents the proportion of subjects in each study who experienced post - treatment ALT flares .
In these studies , a subset of subjects was allowed to discontinue treatment at or after 52 weeks if they achieved a protocol - defined response to therapy .
If entecavir is discontinued without regard to treatment response , the rate of post - treatment flares could be higher .
[ See also Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) . ]

Median time to off - treatment exacerbation was 23 weeks for entecavir - treated subjects and 10 weeks for lamivudine - treated subjects .
Decompensated Liver Disease Study AI463048 was a randomized , open - label study of entecavir 1 mg once daily versus adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg once daily given for up to 48 weeks in adult subjects with chronic HBV infection and evidence of hepatic decompensation , defined as a Child - Turcotte - Pugh ( CTP ) score of 7 or higher [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
Among the 102 subjects receiving entecavir , the most common treatment - emergent adverse events of any severity , regardless of causality , occurring through Week 48 were peripheral edema ( 16 % ) , ascites ( 15 % ) , pyrexia ( 14 % ) , hepatic encephalopathy ( 10 % ) , and upper respiratory infection ( 10 % ) .
Clinical adverse reactions not listed in Table 3 that were observed through Week 48 include blood bicarbonate decreased ( 2 % ) and renal failure ( < 1 % ) .
Eighteen of 102 ( 18 % ) subjects treated with entecavir and 18 / 89 ( 20 % ) subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil died during the first 48 weeks of therapy .
The majority of deaths ( 11 in the entecavir group and 16 in the adefovir dipivoxil group ) were due to liver - related causes such as hepatic failure , hepatic encephalopathy , hepatorenal syndrome , and upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage .
The rate of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) through Week 48 was 6 % ( 6 / 102 ) for subjects treated with entecavir and 8 % ( 7 / 89 ) for subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil .
Five percent of subjects in either treatment arm discontinued therapy due to an adverse event through Week 48 .
No subject in either treatment arm experienced an on - treatment hepatic flare ( ALT > 2 × baseline and > 10 × ULN ) through Week 48 .
Eleven of 102 ( 11 % ) subjects treated with entecavir and 11 / 89 ( 13 % ) subjects treated with adefovir dipivoxil had a confirmed increase in serum creatinine of 0 . 5 mg / dL through Week 48 .
HIV / HBV Co - infected The safety profile of entecavir 1 mg ( n = 51 ) in HIV / HBV co - infected subjects enrolled in Study AI463038 was similar to that of placebo ( n = 17 ) through 24 weeks of blinded treatment and similar to that seen in non - HIV infected subjects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Liver Transplant Recipients Among 65 subjects receiving entecavir in an open - label , post - liver transplant trial [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 8 ) ] , the frequency and nature of adverse events were consistent with those expected in patients who have received a liver transplant and the known safety profile of entecavir .
6 . 2 Clinical Trial Experience in Pediatric Subjects Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol - Myers Squibb Company ’ s Baraclude ® ( entecavir ) tablets .
However , due to Bristol - Myers Squibb Company ’ s marketing exclusivity rights , this drug product is not labeled with that information .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of entecavir .
Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to entecavir exposure .
Immune system disorders : Anaphylactoid reaction .
Metabolism and nutrition disorders : Lactic acidosis .
Hepatobiliary disorders : Increased transaminases .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Alopecia , rash .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Since entecavir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , coadministration of entecavir with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of either entecavir or the coadministered drug .
Coadministration of entecavir with lamivudine , adefovir dipivoxil , or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate did not result in significant drug interactions .
The effects of coadministration of entecavir with other drugs that are renally eliminated or are known to affect renal function have not been evaluated , and patients should be monitored closely for adverse events when entecavir is coadministered with such drugs .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Nursing mothers : Discontinue nursing or entecavir taking into consideration the importance of entecavir to the mother .
( 8 . 3 ) • Liver transplant recipients : Limited data on safety and efficacy are available .
( 8 . 8 ) Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol - Myers Squibb Company ’ s Baraclude ® ( entecavir ) tablets .
However , due to Bristol - Myers Squibb Company ’ s marketing exclusivity rights , this drug product is not labeled with that information .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of entecavir in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , entecavir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry : To monitor fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to entecavir , an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
Animal Data Animal reproduction studies with entecavir in rats and rabbits revealed no evidence of teratogenicity .
Developmental toxicity studies were performed in rats and rabbits .
There were no signs of embryofetal or maternal toxicity when pregnant animals received oral entecavir at approximately 28 ( rat ) and 212 ( rabbit ) times the human exposure achieved at the highest recommended human dose of 1 mg / day .
In rats , maternal toxicity , embryofetal toxicity ( resorptions ) , lower fetal body weights , tail and vertebral malformations , reduced ossification ( vertebrae , sternebrae , and phalanges ) , and extra lumbar vertebrae and ribs were observed at exposures 3100 times those in humans .
In rabbits , embryofetal toxicity ( resorptions ) , reduced ossification ( hyoid ) , and an increased incidence of 13 th rib were observed at exposures 883 times those in humans .
In a peri - postnatal study , no adverse effects on offspring occurred when rats received oral entecavir at exposures greater than 94 times those in humans .
8 . 2 Labor and Delivery There are no studies in pregnant women and no data on the effect of entecavir on transmission of HBV from mother to infant .
Therefore , appropriate interventions should be used to prevent neonatal acquisition of HBV .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether entecavir is excreted into human milk ; however , entecavir is excreted into the milk of rats .
Because many drugs are excreted into human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from entecavir , a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or to discontinue entecavir taking into consideration the importance of continued hepatitis B therapy to the mother and the known benefits of breastfeeding .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The efficacy and safety of entecavir have not been established in patients less than 2 years of age .
Use of entecavir in this age group has not been evaluated because treatment of HBV in this age group is rarely required .
Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol - Myers Squibb Company ’ s Baraclude ® ( entecavir ) tablets .
However , due to Bristol - Myers Squibb Company ’ s marketing exclusivity rights , this drug product is not labeled with that information .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of entecavir did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Entecavir is substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
8 . 6 Racial / Ethnic Groups There are no significant racial differences in entecavir pharmacokinetics . The safety and efficacy of entecavir 0 . 5 mg once daily were assessed in a single - arm , open - label trial of HBeAg - positive or - negative , nucleoside - inhibitor - naïve , Black / African American ( n = 40 ) and Hispanic ( n = 6 ) subjects with chronic HBV infection .
In this trial , 76 % of subjects were male , the mean age was 42 years , 57 % were HBeAg - positive , the mean baseline HBV DNA was 7 . 0 log10 IU / mL , and the mean baseline ALT was 162 U / L .
At Week 48 of treatment , 32 of 46 ( 70 % ) subjects had HBV DNA < 50 IU / mL ( approximately 300 copies / mL ) , 31 of 46 ( 67 % ) subjects had ALT normalization ( ≤ 1 × ULN ) , and 12 of 26 ( 46 % ) HBeAg - positive subjects had HBe seroconversion .
Safety data were similar to those observed in the larger controlled clinical trials .
Because of low enrollment , safety and efficacy have not been established in the US Hispanic population .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment of entecavir is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL / min , including patients on hemodialysis or CAPD [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 8 Liver Transplant Recipients The safety and efficacy of entecavir were assessed in a single - arm , open - label trial in 65 subjects who received a liver transplant for complications of chronic HBV infection .
Eligible subjects who had HBV DNA less than 172 IU / mL ( approximately 1000 copies / mL ) at the time of transplant were treated with entecavir 1 mg once daily in addition to usual post - transplantation management , including hepatitis B immune globulin .
The trial population was 82 % male , 39 % Caucasian , and 37 % Asian , with a mean age of 49 years ; 89 % of subjects had HBeAg - negative disease at the time of transplant .
Four of the 65 subjects received 4 weeks or less of entecavir ( 2 deaths , 1 retransplantation , and 1 protocol violation ) and were not considered evaluable .
Of the 61 subjects who received more than 4 weeks of entecavir , 60 received hepatitis B immune globulin post - transplant .
Fifty - three subjects ( 82 % of all 65 subjects treated ) completed the trial and had HBV DNA measurements at or after 72 weeks treatment post - transplant .
All 53 subjects had HBV DNA < 50 IU / mL ( approximately 300 copies / mL ) .
Eight evaluable subjects did not have HBV DNA data available at 72 weeks , including 3 subjects who died prior to study completion .
No subjects had HBV DNA values ≥ 50 IU / mL while receiving entecavir ( plus hepatitis B immune globulin ) .
All 61 evaluable subjects lost HBsAg post - transplant ; 2 of these subjects experienced recurrence of measurable HBsAg without recurrence of HBV viremia .
This trial was not designed to determine whether addition of entecavir to hepatitis B immune globulin decreased the proportion of subjects with measurable HBV DNA post - transplant compared to hepatitis B immune globulin alone .
If entecavir treatment is determined to be necessary for a liver transplant recipient who has received or is receiving an immunosuppressant that may affect renal function , such as cyclosporine or tacrolimus , renal function must be carefully monitored both before and during treatment with entecavir [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is limited experience of entecavir overdosage reported in patients .
Healthy subjects who received single entecavir doses up to 40 mg or multiple doses up to 20 mg / day for up to 14 days had no increase in or unexpected adverse events .
If overdose occurs , the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity , and standard supportive treatment applied as necessary .
Following a single 1 mg dose of entecavir , a 4 - hour hemodialysis session removed approximately 13 % of the entecavir dose .
11 DESCRIPTION Entecavir is a guanosine nucleoside analogue with selective activity against HBV .
The chemical name for entecavir is 2 - amino - 1 , 9 - dihydro - 9 - [ ( 1 S , 3 R , 4 S ) - 4 - hydroxy - 3 - ( hydroxymethyl ) - 2 - methylenecyclopentyl ] - 6 H - purin - 6 - one , monohydrate .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Entecavir is an antiviral drug [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The single - and multiple - dose pharmacokinetics of entecavir was evaluated in healthy subjects and subjects with chronic hepatitis B virus infection .
Absorption Following oral administration in healthy subjects , entecavir peak plasma concentrations occurred between 0 . 5 and 1 . 5 hours .
Following multiple daily doses ranging from 0 . 1 to 1 mg , C max and area under the concentration - time curve ( AUC ) at steady state increased in proportion to dose .
Steady state was achieved after 6 to 10 days of once - daily administration with approximately 2 - fold accumulation .
For a 0 . 5 mg oral dose , C max at steady state was 4 . 2 ng / mL and trough plasma concentration ( C trough ) was 0 . 3 ng / mL .
For a 1 mg oral dose , C max was 8 . 2 ng / mL and C trough was 0 . 5 ng / mL .
In healthy subjects , the bioavailability of the tablet was 100 % relative to the oral solutions .
The oral solution and tablet may be used interchangeably .
Effects of food on oral absorption : Oral administration of 0 . 5 mg of entecavir with a standard high - fat meal ( 945 kcal , 54 . 6 g fat ) or a light meal ( 379 kcal , 8 . 2 g fat ) resulted in a delay in absorption ( 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 hours fed vs . 0 . 75 hours fasted ) , a decrease in C max of 44 % to 46 % , and a decrease in AUC of 18 % to 20 % [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Distribution Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of entecavir after oral dosing , the estimated apparent volume of distribution is in excess of total body water , suggesting that entecavir is extensively distributed into tissues .
Binding of entecavir to human serum proteins in vitro was approximately 13 % .
Metabolism and Elimination Following administration of 14 C - entecavir in humans and rats , no oxidative or acetylated metabolites were observed .
Minor amounts of phase II metabolites ( glucuronide and sulfate conjugates ) were observed .
Entecavir is not a substrate , inhibitor , or inducer of the cytochrome P450 ( CYP450 ) enzyme system [ see Drug Interactions , below ] .
After reaching peak concentration , entecavir plasma concentrations decreased in a bi - exponential manner with a terminal elimination half - life of approximately 128 to 149 hours .
The observed drug accumulation index is approximately 2 - fold with once - daily dosing , suggesting an effective accumulation half - life of approximately 24 hours .
Entecavir is predominantly eliminated by the kidney with urinary recovery of unchanged drug at steady state ranging from 62 % to 73 % of the administered dose .
Renal clearance is independent of dose and ranges from 360 to 471 mL / min suggesting that entecavir undergoes both glomerular filtration and net tubular secretion [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Special Populations Gender : There are no significant gender differences in entecavir pharmacokinetics .
Race : There are no significant racial differences in entecavir pharmacokinetics .
Elderly : The effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of entecavir was evaluated following administration of a single 1 mg oral dose in healthy young and elderly volunteers .
Entecavir AUC was 29 . 3 % greater in elderly subjects compared to young subjects .
The disparity in exposure between elderly and young subjects was most likely attributable to differences in renal function .
Dosage adjustment of entecavir should be based on the renal function of the patient , rather than age [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Pediatrics : Pediatric use information is approved for Bristol - Myers Squibb Company ’ s Baraclude ® ( entecavir ) tablets .
However , due to Bristol - Myers Squibb Company ’ s marketing exclusivity rights , this drug product is not labeled with that information .
Renal impairment : The pharmacokinetics of entecavir following a single 1 mg dose were studied in subjects ( without chronic hepatitis B virus infection ) with selected degrees of renal impairment , including subjects whose renal impairment was managed by hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) .
Results are shown in Table 7 [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Table 7 : Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Subjects with Selected Degrees of Renal Function Renal Function Group Baseline Creatinine Clearance ( mL / min ) Unimpaired > 80 n = 6 Mild > 50 to ≤ 80 n = 6 Moderate 30 to 50 n = 6 Severe < 30 n = 6 Severe Managed with Hemodialysis [ 1 ] n = 6 Severe Managed with CAPD n = 4 C max ( ng / mL ) ( CV % ) 8 . 1 ( 30 . 7 ) 10 . 4 ( 37 . 2 ) 10 . 5 ( 22 . 7 ) 15 . 3 ( 33 . 8 ) 15 . 4 ( 56 . 4 ) 16 . 6 ( 29 . 7 ) AUC ( 0 – T ) ( ng • h / mL ) ( CV ) 27 . 9 ( 25 . 6 ) 51 . 5 ( 22 . 8 ) 69 . 5 ( 22 . 7 ) 145 . 7 ( 31 . 5 ) 233 . 9 ( 28 . 4 ) 221 . 8 ( 11 . 6 ) CLR ( mL / min ) ( SD ) 383 . 2 ( 101 . 8 ) 197 . 9 ( 78 . 1 ) 135 . 6 ( 31 . 6 ) 40 . 3 ( 10 . 1 ) NA NA CLT / F ( mL / min ) ( SD ) 588 . 1 ( 153 . 7 ) 309 . 2 ( 62 . 6 ) 226 . 3 ( 60 . 1 ) 100 . 6 ( 29 . 1 ) 50 . 6 ( 16 . 5 ) 35 . 7 ( 19 . 6 ) [ 1 ] Dosed immediately following hemodialysis .
CLR = renal clearance ; CLT / F = apparent oral clearance .
Following a single 1 mg dose of entecavir administered 2 hours before the hemodialysis session , hemodialysis removed approximately 13 % of the entecavir dose over 4 hours .
CAPD removed approximately 0 . 3 % of the dose over 7 days [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Hepatic impairment : The pharmacokinetics of entecavir following a single 1 mg dose were studied in adult subjects ( without chronic hepatitis B virus infection ) with moderate or severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Turcotte - Pugh Class B or C ) .
The pharmacokinetics of entecavir were similar between hepatically impaired and healthy control subjects ; therefore , no dosage adjustment of entecavir is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment .
The pharmacokinetics of entecavir have not been studied in pediatric subjects with hepatic impairment .
Post - liver transplant : Limited data are available on the safety and efficacy of entecavir in liver transplant recipients .
In a small pilot study of entecavir use in HBV - infected liver transplant recipients on a stable dose of cyclosporine A ( n = 5 ) or tacrolimus ( n = 4 ) , entecavir exposure was approximately 2 - fold the exposure in healthy subjects with normal renal function .
Altered renal function contributed to the increase in entecavir exposure in these subjects .
The potential for pharmacokinetic interactions between entecavir and cyclosporine A or tacrolimus was not formally evaluated [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 8 ) ] .
Drug Interactions The metabolism of entecavir was evaluated in in vitro and in vivo studies .
Entecavir is not a substrate , inhibitor , or inducer of the cytochrome P450 ( CYP450 ) enzyme system .
At concentrations up to approximately 10 , 000 - fold higher than those obtained in humans , entecavir inhibited none of the major human CYP450 enzymes 1A2 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 3A4 , 2B6 , and 2E1 .
At concentrations up to approximately 340 - fold higher than those observed in humans , entecavir did not induce the human CYP450 enzymes 1A2 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 3A4 , 3A5 , and 2B6 .
The pharmacokinetics of entecavir is unlikely to be affected by coadministration with agents that are either metabolized by , inhibit , or induce the CYP450 system .
Likewise , the pharmacokinetics of known CYP substrates is unlikely to be affected by coadministration of entecavir .
The steady - state pharmacokinetics of entecavir and coadministered drug were not altered in interaction studies of entecavir with lamivudine , adefovir dipivoxil , and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Entecavir , a guanosine nucleoside analogue with activity against HBV reverse transcriptase ( rt ) , is efficiently phosphorylated to the active triphosphate form , which has an intracellular half - life of 15 hours .
By competing with the natural substrate deoxyguanosine triphosphate , entecavir triphosphate functionally inhibits all three activities of the HBV reverse transcriptase : ( 1 ) base priming , ( 2 ) reverse transcription of the negative strand from the pregenomic messenger RNA , and ( 3 ) synthesis of the positive strand of HBV DNA .
Entecavir triphosphate is a weak inhibitor of cellular DNA polymerases α , β , and δ and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ with K i values ranging from 18 to > 160 μM .
Antiviral Activity Entecavir inhibited HBV DNA synthesis ( 50 % reduction , EC 50 ) at a concentration of 0 . 004 μM in human HepG2 cells transfected with wild - type HBV .
The median EC 50 value for entecavir against lamivudine - resistant HBV ( rtL180M , rtM204V ) was 0 . 026 μM ( range 0 . 010 to 0 . 059 μM ) .
The coadministration of HIV nucleoside / nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) with entecavir is unlikely to reduce the antiviral efficacy of entecavir against HBV or of any of these agents against HIV .
In HBV combination assays in cell culture , abacavir , didanosine , lamivudine , stavudine , tenofovir , or zidovudine were not antagonistic to the anti - HBV activity of entecavir over a wide range of concentrations .
In HIV antiviral assays , entecavir was not antagonistic to the cell culture anti - HIV activity of these six NRTIs or emtricitabine at concentrations greater than 100 times the C max of entecavir using the 1 mg dose .
Antiviral Activity against HIV A comprehensive analysis of the inhibitory activity of entecavir against a panel of laboratory and clinical HIV type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) isolates using a variety of cells and assay conditions yielded EC 50 values ranging from 0 . 026 to > 10 μM ; the lower EC 50 values were observed when decreased levels of virus were used in the assay .
In cell culture , entecavir selected for an M184I substitution in HIV reverse transcriptase at micromolar concentrations , confirming inhibitory pressure at high entecavir concentrations .
HIV variants containing the M184V substitution showed loss of susceptibility to entecavir .
Resistance In Cell Culture In cell - based assays , 8 - to 30 - fold reductions in entecavir phenotypic susceptibility were observed for lamivudine - resistant strains .
Further reductions ( > 70 - fold ) in entecavir phenotypic susceptibility required the presence of amino acid substitutions rtM204I / V with or without rtL180M along with additional substitutions at residues rtT184 , rtS202 , or rtM250 , or a combination of these substitutions with or without an rtI169 substitution in the HBV reverse transcriptase .
Clinical Studies Nucleoside - inhibitor - naïve subjects : Genotypic evaluations were performed on evaluable samples ( > 300 copies / mL serum HBV DNA ) from 562 subjects who were treated with entecavir for up to 96 weeks in nucleoside - inhibitor - naïve studies ( AI463022 , AI463027 , and rollover study AI463901 ) .
By Week 96 , evidence of emerging amino acid substitution rtS202G with rtM204V and rtL180M substitutions was detected in the HBV of 2 subjects ( 2 / 562 = < 1 % ) , and 1 of them experienced virologic rebound ( ≥ 1 log 10 increase above nadir ) .
In addition , emerging amino acid substitutions at rtM204I / V and rtL180M , rtL80I , or rtV173L , which conferred decreased phenotypic susceptibility to entecavir in the absence of rtT184 , rtS202 , or rtM250 changes , were detected in the HBV of 3 subjects ( 3 / 562 = < 1 % ) who experienced virologic rebound .
For subjects who continued treatment beyond 48 weeks , 75 % ( 202 / 269 ) had HBV DNA < 300 copies / mL at end of dosing ( up to 96 weeks ) .
HBeAg - positive ( n = 243 ) and - negative ( n = 39 ) treatment - naïve subjects who failed to achieve the study - defined complete response by 96 weeks were offered continued entecavir treatment in a rollover study .
Complete response for HBeAg - positive was < 0 . 7 MEq / mL ( approximately 7 × 10 5 copies / mL ) serum HBV DNA and HBeAg loss and , for HBeAg - negative was < 0 . 7 MEq / mL HBV DNA and ALT normalization .
Subjects received 1 mg entecavir once daily for up to an additional 144 weeks .
Of these 282 subjects , 141 HBeAg - positive and 8 HBeAg - negative subjects entered the long - term follow - up rollover study and were evaluated for entecavir resistance .
Of the 149 subjects entering the rollover study , 88 % ( 131 / 149 ) , 92 % ( 137 / 149 ) , and 92 % ( 137 / 149 ) attained serum HBV DNA < 300 copies / mL by Weeks 144 , 192 , and 240 ( including end of dosing ) , respectively .
No novel entecavir resistance - associated substitutions were identified in a comparison of the genotypes of evaluable isolates with their respective baseline isolates .
The cumulative probability of developing rtT184 , rtS202 , or rtM250 entecavir resistance - associated substitutions ( in the presence of rtM204V and rtL180M substitutions ) at Weeks 48 , 96 , 144 , 192 , and 240 was 0 . 2 % , 0 . 5 % , 1 . 2 % , 1 . 2 % , and 1 . 2 % , respectively .
Lamivudine - refractory subjects : Genotypic evaluations were performed on evaluable samples from 190 subjects treated with entecavir for up to 96 weeks in studies of lamivudine - refractory HBV ( AI463026 , AI463014 , AI463015 , and rollover study AI463901 ) .
By Week 96 , resistance - associated amino acid substitutions at rtS202 , rtT184 , or rtM250 , with or without rtI169 changes , in the presence of amino acid substitutions rtM204I / V with or without rtL180M , rtL80V , or rtV173L / M emerged in the HBV from 22 subjects ( 22 / 190 = 12 % ) , 16 of whom experienced virologic rebound ( ≥ 1 log 10 increase above nadir ) and 4 of whom were never suppressed < 300 copies / mL .
The HBV from 4 of these subjects had entecavir resistance substitutions at baseline and acquired further changes on entecavir treatment .
In addition to the 22 subjects , 3 subjects experienced virologic rebound with the emergence of rtM204I / V and rtL180M , rtL80V , or rtV173L / M .
For isolates from subjects who experienced virologic rebound with the emergence of resistance substitutions ( n = 19 ) , the median fold - change in entecavir EC 50 values from reference was 19 - fold at baseline and 106 - fold at the time of virologic rebound .
For subjects who continued treatment beyond 48 weeks , 40 % ( 31 / 77 ) had HBV DNA < 300 copies / mL at end of dosing ( up to 96 weeks ) .
Lamivudine - refractory subjects ( n = 157 ) who failed to achieve the study - defined complete response by Week 96 were offered continued entecavir treatment .
Subjects received 1 mg entecavir once daily for up to an additional 144 weeks .
Of these subjects , 80 subjects entered the long - term follow - up study and were evaluated for entecavir resistance .
By Weeks 144 , 192 , and 240 ( including end of dosing ) , 34 % ( 27 / 80 ) , 35 % ( 28 / 80 ) , and 36 % ( 29 / 80 ) , respectively , attained HBV DNA < 300 copies / mL .
The cumulative probability of developing rtT184 , rtS202 , or rtM250 entecavir resistance - associated substitutions ( in the presence of rtM204I / V with or without rtL180M substitutions ) at Weeks 48 , 96 , 144 , 192 , and 240 was 6 . 2 % , 15 % , 36 . 3 % , 46 . 6 % , and 51 . 5 % , respectively .
The HBV of 6 subjects developed rtA181C / G / S / T amino acid substitutions while receiving entecavir , and of these , 4 developed entecavir resistance - associated substitutions at rtT184 , rtS202 , or rtM250 and 1 had an rtT184S substitution at baseline .
Of 7 subjects whose HBV had an rtA181 substitution at baseline , 2 also had substitutions at rtT184 , rtS202 , or rtM250 at baseline and another 2 developed them while on treatment with entecavir .
Cross - resistance Cross - resistance has been observed among HBV nucleoside analogue inhibitors .
In cell - based assays , entecavir had 8 - to 30 - fold less inhibition of HBV DNA synthesis for HBV containing lamivudine and telbivudine resistance substitutions rtM204I / V with or without rtL180M than for wild - type HBV .
Substitutions rtM204I / V with or without rtL180M , rtL80I / V , or rtV173L , which are associated with lamivudine and telbivudine resistance , also confer decreased phenotypic susceptibility to entecavir .
The efficacy of entecavir against HBV harboring adefovir resistance - associated substitutions has not been established in clinical trials .
HBV isolates from lamivudine - refractory subjects failing entecavir therapy were susceptible in cell culture to adefovir but remained resistant to lamivudine .
Recombinant HBV genomes encoding adefovir resistance - associated substitutions at either rtN236T or rtA181V had 0 . 3 - and 1 . 1 - fold shifts in susceptibility to entecavir in cell culture , respectively .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long - term oral carcinogenicity studies of entecavir in mice and rats were carried out at exposures up to approximately 42 times ( mice ) and 35 times ( rats ) those observed in humans at the highest recommended dose of 1 mg / day .
In mouse and rat studies , entecavir was positive for carcinogenic findings .
In mice , lung adenomas were increased in males and females at exposures 3 and 40 times those in humans .
Lung carcinomas in both male and female mice were increased at exposures 40 times those in humans .
Combined lung adenomas and carcinomas were increased in male mice at exposures 3 times and in female mice at exposures 40 times those in humans .
Tumor development was preceded by pneumocyte proliferation in the lung , which was not observed in rats , dogs , or monkeys administered entecavir , supporting the conclusion that lung tumors in mice may be a species - specific event .
Hepatocellular carcinomas were increased in males and combined liver adenomas and carcinomas were also increased at exposures 42 times those in humans .
Vascular tumors in female mice ( hemangiomas of ovaries and uterus and hemangiosarcomas of spleen ) were increased at exposures 40 times those in humans .
In rats , hepatocellular adenomas were increased in females at exposures 24 times those in humans ; combined adenomas and carcinomas were also increased in females at exposures 24 times those in humans .
Brain gliomas were induced in both males and females at exposures 35 and 24 times those in humans .
Skin fibromas were induced in females at exposures 4 times those in humans .
It is not known how predictive the results of rodent carcinogenicity studies may be for humans .
Mutagenesis Entecavir was clastogenic to human lymphocyte cultures .
Entecavir was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay using S . typhimurium and E . coli strains in the presence or absence of metabolic activation , a mammalian - cell gene mutation assay , and a transformation assay with Syrian hamster embryo cells .
Entecavir was also negative in an oral micronucleus study and an oral DNA repair study in rats .
Impairment of Fertility In reproductive toxicology studies , in which animals were administered entecavir at up to 30 mg / kg for up to 4 weeks , no evidence of impaired fertility was seen in male or female rats at systemic exposures greater than 90 times those achieved in humans at the highest recommended dose of 1 mg / day .
In rodent and dog toxicology studies , seminiferous tubular degeneration was observed at exposures 35 times or greater than those achieved in humans .
No testicular changes were evident in monkeys .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Outcomes in Adults The safety and efficacy of entecavir in adults were evaluated in three Phase 3 active - controlled trials .
These studies included 1633 subjects 16 years of age or older with chronic hepatitis B virus infection ( serum HBsAg - positive for at least 6 months ) accompanied by evidence of viral replication ( detectable serum HBV DNA , as measured by the bDNA hybridization or PCR assay ) .
Subjects had persistently elevated ALT levels at least 1 . 3 times ULN and chronic inflammation on liver biopsy compatible with a diagnosis of chronic viral hepatitis .
The safety and efficacy of entecavir were also evaluated in a study of 191 HBV - infected subjects with decompensated liver disease and in a study of 68 subjects co - infected with HBV and HIV .
Nucleoside - inhibitor - naïve Subjects with Compensated Liver Disease HBeAg - positive : Study AI463022 was a multinational , randomized , double - blind study of entecavir 0 . 5 mg once daily versus lamivudine 100 mg once daily for a minimum of 52 weeks in 709 ( of 715 randomized ) nucleoside - inhibitor - naïve subjects with chronic hepatitis B virus infection , compensated liver disease , and detectable HBeAg .
The mean age of subjects was 35 years , 75 % were male , 57 % were Asian , 40 % were Caucasian , and 13 % had previously received interferon - α .
At baseline , subjects had a mean Knodell Necroinflammatory Score of 7 . 8 , mean serum HBV DNA as measured by Roche COBAS Amplicor PCR assay was 9 . 66 log 10 copies / mL , and mean serum ALT level was 143 U / L .
Paired , adequate liver biopsy samples were available for 89 % of subjects .
HBeAg - negative ( anti - HBe - positive / HBV DNA - positive ) : Study AI463027 was a multinational , randomized , double - blind study of entecavir 0 . 5 mg once daily versus lamivudine 100 mg once daily for a minimum of 52 weeks in 638 ( of 648 randomized ) nucleoside - inhibitor - naïve subjects with HBeAg - negative ( HBeAb - positive ) chronic hepatitis B virus infection and compensated liver disease .
The mean age of subjects was 44 years , 76 % were male , 39 % were Asian , 58 % were Caucasian , and 13 % had previously received interferon - α .
At baseline , subjects had a mean Knodell Necroinflammatory Score of 7 . 8 , mean serum HBV DNA as measured by Roche COBAS Amplicor PCR assay was 7 . 58 log 10 copies / mL , and mean serum ALT level was 142 U / L .
Paired , adequate liver biopsy samples were available for 88 % of subjects .
In Studies AI463022 and AI463027 , entecavir was superior to lamivudine on the primary efficacy endpoint of Histologic Improvement , defined as a 2 - point or greater reduction in Knodell Necroinflammatory Score with no worsening in Knodell Fibrosis Score at Week 48 , and on the secondary efficacy measures of reduction in viral load and ALT normalization .
Histologic Improvement and change in Ishak Fibrosis Score are shown in Table 8 .
Selected virologic , biochemical , and serologic outcome measures are shown in Table 9 .

Ninety - nine percent of subjects were HBeAg - positive at baseline , with a mean baseline ALT level of 71 . 5 U / L .
Median HIV RNA level remained stable at approximately 2 log 10 copies / mL through 24 weeks of blinded therapy .
Virologic and biochemical endpoints at Week 24 are shown in Table 13 .
There are no data in patients with HIV / HBV co - infection who have not received prior lamivudine therapy .
Entecavir has not been evaluated in HIV / HBV co - infected patients who were not simultaneously receiving effective HIV treatment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .

[ 3 ] Percentage of subjects with abnormal ALT ( > 1 × ULN ) at baseline who achieved ALT normalization ( n = 35 for entecavir and n = 12 for placebo ) .
For subjects originally assigned to entecavir , at the end of the open - label phase ( Week 48 ) , 8 % of subjects had HBV DNA < 300 copies / mL by PCR , the mean change from baseline HBV DNA by PCR was − 4 . 20 log 10 copies / mL , and 37 % of subjects with abnormal ALT at baseline had ALT normalization ( ≤ 1 × ULN ) .
Beyond 48 Weeks The optimal duration of therapy with entecavir is unknown .
According to protocol - mandated criteria in the Phase 3 clinical trials , subjects discontinued entecavir or lamivudine treatment after 52 weeks according to a definition of response based on HBV virologic suppression ( < 0 . 7 MEq / mL by bDNA assay ) and loss of HBeAg ( in HBeAg - positive subjects ) or ALT < 1 . 25 × ULN ( in HBeAg - negative subjects ) at Week 48 .
Subjects who achieved virologic suppression but did not have serologic response ( HBeAg - positive ) or did not achieve ALT < 1 . 25 × ULN ( HBeAg - negative ) continued blinded dosing through 96 weeks or until the response criteria were met .
These protocol - specified subject management guidelines are not intended as guidance for clinical practice .
Nucleoside - inhibitor - naïve subjects : Among nucleoside - inhibitor - naïve , HBeAg - positive subjects ( Study AI463022 ) , 243 ( 69 % ) entecavir - treated subjects and 164 ( 46 % ) lamivudine - treated subjects continued blinded treatment for up to 96 weeks .
Of those continuing blinded treatment in Year 2 , 180 ( 74 % ) entecavir subjects and 60 ( 37 % ) lamivudine subjects achieved HBV DNA < 300 copies / mL by PCR at the end of dosing ( up to 96 weeks ) .
193 ( 79 % ) entecavir subjects achieved ALT ≤ 1 × ULN compared to 112 ( 68 % ) lamivudine subjects , and HBeAg seroconversion occurred in 26 ( 11 % ) entecavir subjects and 20 ( 12 % ) lamivudine subjects .
Among nucleoside - inhibitor - naïve , HBeAg - positive subjects , 74 ( 21 % ) entecavir subjects and 67 ( 19 % ) lamivudine subjects met the definition of response at Week 48 , discontinued study drugs , and were followed off treatment for 24 weeks .
Among entecavir responders , 26 ( 35 % ) subjects had HBV DNA < 300 copies / mL , 55 ( 74 % ) subjects had ALT ≤ 1 × ULN , and 56 ( 76 % ) subjects sustained HBeAg seroconversion at the end of follow - up .
Among lamivudine responders , 20 ( 30 % ) subjects had HBV DNA < 300 copies / mL , 41 ( 61 % ) subjects had ALT ≤ 1 × ULN , and 47 ( 70 % ) subjects sustained HBeAg seroconversion at the end of follow - up .
Among nucleoside - inhibitor - naïve , HBeAg - negative subjects ( Study AI463027 ) , 26 ( 8 % ) entecavir - treated subjects and 28 ( 9 % ) lamivudine - treated subjects continued blinded treatment for up to 96 weeks .
In this small cohort continuing treatment in Year 2 , 22 entecavir and 16 lamivudine subjects had HBV DNA < 300 copies / mL by PCR , and 7 and 6 subjects , respectively , had ALT ≤ 1 × ULN at the end of dosing ( up to 96 weeks ) .
Among nucleoside - inhibitor - naïve , HBeAg - negative subjects , 275 ( 85 % ) entecavir subjects and 245 ( 78 % ) lamivudine subjects met the definition of response at Week 48 , discontinued study drugs , and were followed off treatment for 24 weeks .
In this cohort , very few subjects in each treatment arm had HBV DNA < 300 copies / mL by PCR at the end of follow - up .
At the end of follow - up , 126 ( 46 % ) entecavir subjects and 84 ( 34 % ) lamivudine subjects had ALT ≤ 1 × ULN .
Lamivudine - refractory subjects : Among lamivudine - refractory subjects ( Study AI463026 ) , 77 ( 55 % ) entecavir - treated subjects and 3 ( 2 % ) lamivudine subjects continued blinded treatment for up to 96 weeks .
In this cohort of entecavir subjects , 31 ( 40 % ) subjects achieved HBV DNA < 300 copies / mL , 62 ( 81 % ) subjects had ALT ≤ 1 × ULN , and 8 ( 10 % ) subjects demonstrated HBeAg seroconversion at the end of dosing .
