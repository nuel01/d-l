[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] DESCRIPTION BSS PLUS ™ is a sterile intraocular irrigating solution for use during all intraocular surgical procedures , including those requiring a relatively long intraocular perfusion time ( e . g . , pars plana vitrectomy , phacoemulsification , extra capsular cataract extraction / lens aspiration , anterior segment reconstruction , etc . ) .
The solution does not contain a preservative and should be prepared just prior to use in surgery .
Part I : Part I is a sterile 480 mL solution in a 500 mL single - dose bag to which the Part II concentrate is added .
Each mL of Part I contains : sodium chloride 7 . 44 mg , potassium chloride 0 . 395 mg , dibasic sodium phosphate 0 . 433 mg , sodium bicarbonate 2 . 19 mg , hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide ( to adjust pH ) , in water for injection .
Part II : Part II is a sterile concentrate in a 20 mL single - dose vial for addition to Part I . Each mL of Part II contains : calcium chloride dihydrate 3 . 85 mg , magnesium chloride hexahydrate 5 mg , dextrose 23 mg , glutathione disulfide ( oxidized glutathione ) 4 . 6 mg , in water for injection .
After addition of BSS PLUS solution Part II to the Part I bag , each mL of the reconstituted product contains : sodium chloride 7 . 14 mg , potassium chloride 0 . 38 mg , calcium chloride dihydrate 0 . 154 mg , magnesium chloride hexahydrate 0 . 2 mg , dibasic sodium phosphate 0 . 42 mg , sodium bicarbonate 2 . 1 mg , dextrose 0 . 92 mg , glutathione disulfide ( oxidized glutathione ) 0 . 184 mg , hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide ( to adjust pH ) , in water for injection .
The reconstituted product has a pH of approximately 7 . 4 .
Osmolality is approximately 305 mOsm .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY None of the components of BSS PLUS solution are foreign to the eye , and BSS PLUS solution has no pharmacological action .
Human perfused cornea studies have shown BSS PLUS solution to be an effective irrigation solution for providing corneal detumescence and maintaining corneal endothelial integrity during intraocular perfusion .
An in vivo study in rabbits has shown the BSS PLUS solution is more suitable than normal saline or Balanced Salt Solution for intravitreal irrigation because BSS PLUS solution contains the appropriate bicarbonate , pH , and ionic composition necessary for the maintenance of normal retinal electrical activity .
Human in vivo studies have demonstrated BSS PLUS solution to be safe and effective when used during surgical procedures such as pars plana vitrectomy , phacoemulsification , cataract extraction / lens aspiration , anterior segment reconstruction .
No differences have been observed between adults and pediatric patients following use of this drug product .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE BSS PLUS solution is indicated for use as an intraocular irrigating solution during intraocular surgical procedures involving perfusion of the eye .
CONTRAINDICATIONS There are no specific contraindications to the use of BSS PLUS solution ; however , contraindications for the surgical procedure during which BSS PLUS solution is to be used should be strictly adhered to .
WARNINGS For IRRIGATION during ophthalmic surgery only .
Not for injection or intravenous infusion .
Do not use unless product is clear , seal is intact and container is undamaged .
Do not use if product is discolored or contains a precipitate .
PRECAUTIONS DO NOT USE BSS PLUS solution UNTIL PART I IS FULLY RECONSTITUTED WITH PART II .
Discard unused contents .
BSS PLUS does not contain a preservative ; therefore , do not use this container for more than one patient .
DISCARD ANY UNUSED PORTION SIX HOURS AFTER PREPARATION .
Studies suggest that intraocular irrigating solutions which are iso - osmotic with normal aqueous fluids should be used with caution in diabetic patients undergoing vitrectomy since intraoperative lens changes have been observed .
There have been reports of corneal clouding or edema following ocular surgery in which BSS PLUS solution was used as an irrigating solution .
As in all surgical procedures appropriate measures should be taken to minimize trauma to the cornea and other ocular tissues .
Preparation Reconstitute BSS PLUS Intraocular Irrigating Solution just prior to use in surgery .
Follow the same strict aseptic procedures in the reconstitution of BSS PLUS solution as is used for intravenous additives .
Remove the BSS PLUS solution Part I ( 480 mL ) bag from the clear overwrap .
Remove the blue flip - off seal from the BSS PLUS solution Part II ( 20 mL ) vial .
Clean and disinfect the rubber stoppers on both containers by using sterile alcohol wipes .
Transfer the contents of the Part II vial to the Part I bag using a BSS PLUS solution Dual - Spike Transfer Device ( provided ) .
An alternative method of solution transfer may be accomplished by using a 20 mL syringe to remove the Part II solution from the vial and transferring exactly 20 mL to the Part I container through the outer target area of the rubber stopper .
An excess volume of Part II is provided in each vial .
Gently agitate the contents to mix the solution .
Place a sterile cap on the bag .
Record the time and date of reconstitution and the patient ' s name on the bag label .
GERIATRIC USE No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Postoperative inflammatory reactions as well as incidents of corneal edema and corneal decompensation have been reported .
Their relationship to the use of BSS PLUS solution has not been established .
OVERDOSAGE The solution has no pharmacological action and thus no potential for overdosage .
However , as with any intraocular surgical procedure , the duration of intraocular manipulation should be kept to a minimum .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The solution should be used according to the standard technique employed by the operating surgeon .
For non - active irrigating system , use an administration set with an air - inlet in the plastic spike since the bag does not contain a separate airway tube .
Follow the directions for the particular administration set to be used .
Insert the spike aseptically into the bag through the center target area of the rubber stopper .
Allow the fluid to flow to remove air from the tubing before intraocular irrigation begins .
HOW SUPPLIED BSS PLUS solution is supplied in two packages for reconstitution prior to use : a 500 mL bag containing 480 mL ( Part I ) and a 20 mL glass vial ( Part II ) ; both using grey butyl stoppers and aluminum seals .
See the PRECAUTIONS section regarding reconstitution of the solution .
NDC 0065 - 0800 - 94 STORAGE AND HANDLING Store Part I and Part II at 2 ° - 25 ° C ( 36 ° - 77 ° F ) .
