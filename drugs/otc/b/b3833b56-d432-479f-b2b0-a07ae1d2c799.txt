Reactions to bendamustine hydrochloride have included anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions .
( 4 , 5 . 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Myelosuppression : Delay or reduce dose , and restart treatment based on ANC and platelet count recovery .
( 5 . 1 ) • Infections : Monitor for fever and other signs of infection or reactivation of infections and treat promptly .
( 5 . 2 ) • Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) : Monitor for new or worsening neurological , cognitive or behavioral signs or symptoms suggestive of PML .
( 5 . 3 ) • Anaphylaxis and Infusion - Related Reactions : Severe anaphylactic reactions have occurred .
Monitor clinically and discontinue drug for severe reactions .
Pre - medicate in subsequent cycles for milder reactions .
( 5 . 4 ) • Tumor Lysis Syndrome : May lead to acute renal failure and death ; anticipate and use supportive measures in patients at high risk .
( 5 . 5 ) • Skin Reactions : Discontinue for severe skin reactions .
Cases of SJS , DRESS and TEN , some fatal , have been reported .
( 5 . 6 ) .
• Hepatotoxicity : Monitor liver chemistry tests prior to and during treatment .
( 5 . 7 ) • Other Malignancies : Pre - malignant and malignant diseases have been reported .
( 5 . 8 ) • Extravasation Injury : Take precautions to avoid extravasation , including monitoring intravenous infusion site during and after administration .
( 5 . 9 ) • Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm .
Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective method of contraception .
( 5 . 10 , 8 . 1 ) 5 . 1 Myelosuppression VIVIMUSTA causes myelosuppression .
Bendamustine hydrochloride caused severe myelosuppression ( Grade 3 - 4 ) in 98 % of patients in the two NHL studies [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Three patients ( 2 % ) died from myelosuppression - related adverse reactions ; one each from neutropenic sepsis , diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia and pneumonia from an opportunistic infection ( CMV ) .
Monitor complete blood counts , including leukocytes , platelets , hemoglobin ( Hgb ) , and neutrophils frequently .
In the clinical trials , blood counts were monitored every week initially .
Hematologic nadirs were observed predominantly in the third week of therapy .
Myelosuppression may require dose delays and / or subsequent dose reductions if recovery to the recommended values has not occurred by the first day of the next scheduled cycle .
Delay the next cycle of therapy if ANC less than 1 x 109 / L or platelet count less than 75 x 109 / L [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 2 Infections Infection , including pneumonia , sepsis , septic shock , hepatitis and death has occurred in adult and pediatric patients in clinical trials and in postmarketing reports for bendamustine hydrochloride .
Patients with myelosuppression following treatment with bendamustine hydrochloride are more susceptible to infections .
Advise patients with myelosuppression following VIVIMUSTA treatment to contact healthcare provider immediately if they have symptoms or signs of infection .
Patients treated with VIVIMUSTA are at risk for reactivation of infections including ( but not limited to ) hepatitis B , cytomegalovirus , Mycobacterium tuberculosis , and herpes zoster .
Implement appropriate measures ( including clinical and laboratory monitoring , prophylaxis , and treatment ) for infection and infection reactivation prior to administration .
5 . 3 Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) , including fatal cases , have occurred following treatment with bendamustine , primarily in combination with rituximab or obinutuzumab [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening neurological , cognitive or behavioral signs or symptoms .
If PML is suspected , withhold VIVIMUSTA treatment and perform appropriate diagnostic evaluations .
Consider discontinuation or reduction of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop PML .
5 . 4 Anaphylaxis and Infusion - Related Reactions Infusion - related reactions to bendamustine hydrochloride have occurred commonly in clinical trials .
Symptoms include fever , chills , pruritus and rash .
In rare instances , severe anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have occurred , particularly in the second and subsequent cycles of therapy .
Monitor clinically and discontinue drug for severe reactions .
Ask patients about symptoms suggestive of infusion - related reactions after their first cycle of therapy .
Do not rechallenge patients who experienced Grade 3 or worse allergic - type reactions .
Consider measures to prevent severe reactions , including antihistamines , antipyretics and corticosteroids in subsequent cycles in patients who have experienced Grade 1 or 2 infusion - related reactions .
Discontinue VIVIMUSTA for patients with Grade 4 infusion - related reactions .
Consider discontinuation for Grade 3 infusion - related reactions as clinically appropriate considering individual benefits , risks , and supportive care .
5 . 5 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome associated with bendamustine hydrochloride has occurred in patients in clinical trials and in postmarketing reports .
The onset tends to be within the first treatment cycle of bendamustine hydrochloride and , without intervention , may lead to acute renal failure and death .
Administer vigorous hydration and monitor blood chemistry , particularly potassium and uric acid levels at baseline and closely during treatment with VIVIMUSTA .
Allopurinol has also been used during the beginning of bendamustine hydrochloride therapy .
However , there may be an increased risk of severe skin toxicity when bendamustine hydrochloride and allopurinol are administered concomitantly [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
5 . 6 Skin Reactions Fatal and serious skin reactions have been reported with bendamustine hydrochloride treatment in clinical trials and postmarketing safety reports , including toxic skin reactions [ Stevens - Johnson Syndrome ( SJS ) , toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) ] , bullous exanthema , and rash .
Events occurred when bendamustine hydrochloride was given as a single agent and in combination with other anticancer agents or allopurinol .
Where skin reactions occur , they may be progressive and increase in severity with further treatment .
Monitor patients with skin reactions closely .
If skin reactions are severe or progressive , withhold or discontinue VIVIMUSTA .
5 . 7 Hepatotoxicity Fatal and serious cases of liver injury have been reported with bendamustine hydrochloride injection .
Combination therapy , progressive disease or reactivation of hepatitis B were confounding factors in some patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Most cases were reported within the first three months of starting therapy .
Monitor liver chemistry tests prior to and during treatment with VIVIMUSTA .
5 . 8 Other Malignancies Pre - malignant and malignant diseases have developed in patients who have been treated with bendamustine hydrochloride , including myelodysplastic syndrome , myeloproliferative disorders , acute myeloid leukemia , bronchial carcinoma , and non - melanoma skin cancer including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Monitor patients for the development of secondary malignancies .
Perform dermatologic evaluations during and after treatment with VIVIMUSTA .
5 . 9 Extravasation Injury Bendamustine hydrochloride extravasations have been reported in postmarketing resulting in hospitalizations from erythema , marked swelling , and pain .
Assure good venous access prior to starting VIVIMUSTA infusion and monitor the intravenous infusion site for redness , swelling , pain , infection , and necrosis during and after administration of VIVIMUSTA .
5 . 10 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal reproduction studies and the drug ' s mechanism of action , VIVIMUSTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Single intraperitoneal doses of bendamustine ( that approximated the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area ) to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes , including an increase in resorptions , skeletal and visceral malformations , and decreased fetal body weights .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with VIVIMUSTA and for 6 months after the last dose .
Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VIVIMUSTA and for 3 months after the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) • Infertility : May impair fertility .
( 8 . 3 ) • Renal Impairment : Do not use in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min .
( 8 . 6 ) • Hepatic Impairment : Do not use in patients with total bilirubin 1 . 5 - 3 x ULN and AST or ALT 2 . 5 - 1 . 0 x ULN , or total bilirubin > 3 x ULN .
( 8 . 7 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In animal reproduction studies , intraperitoneal administration of bendamustine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis at doses 0 . 6 to 1 . 8 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) resulted in embryo - fetal and / or infant mortality , structural abnormalities , and alterations to growth ( see Data ) .
There are no available data on bendamustine hydrochloride use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Bendamustine hydrochloride was intraperitoneally administered once to mice from 210 mg / m2 ( approximately 1 . 8 times the MRHD ) during organogenesis and caused an increase in resorptions , skeletal and visceral malformations ( exencephaly , cleft palates , accessory rib , and spinal deformities ) and decreased fetal body weights .
This dose did not appear to be maternally toxic and lower doses were not evaluated .
Repeat intraperitoneal administration of bendamustine hydrochloride in mice on gestation days 7 to 11 resulted in an increase in resorptions from 75 mg / m2 ( approximately 0 . 6 times the MRHD ) and an increase in abnormalities from 112 . 5 mg / m2 ( approximately 0 . 9 times the MRHD ) , similar to those seen after a single intraperitoneal administration .
Bendamustine hydrochloride was intraperitoneally administered once to rats from 120 mg / m2 ( approximately the MRHD ) on gestation days 4 , 7 , 9 , 11 , or 13 and caused embryo and fetal lethality as indicated by increased resorptions and a decrease in live fetuses .
A significant increase in external ( effect on tail , head , and herniation of external organs [ exomphalos ] ) and internal ( hydronephrosis and hydrocephalus ) malformations were seen in dosed rats .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of bendamustine hydrochloride or its metabolites in either human or animal milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with VIVIMUSTA and for 1 week after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential VIVIMUSTA can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiation of treatment with VIVIMUSTA .
Contraception Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VIVIMUSTA and for 6 months after the last dose .
Males Based on genotoxicity findings , advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VIVIMUSTA and for 3 months after the last dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Based on findings from clinical studies , VIVIMUSTA may impair male fertility .
Impaired spermatogenesis , azoospermia , and total germinal aplasia have been reported in male patients treated with alkylating agents , especially in combination with other drugs .
In some instances spermatogenesis may return in patients in remission , but this may occur only several years after intensive chemotherapy has been discontinued .
Advise patients of the potential risk to their reproductive capacities .
Based on findings from animal studies , VIVIMUSTA may impair male fertility due to an increase in morphologically abnormal spermatozoa .
The long - term effects of VIVIMUSTA on male fertility , including the reversibility of adverse effects , have not been studied [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Safety , pharmacokinetics and efficacy were assessed in a single open - label trial ( NCT01088984 ) in patients aged 1 - 19 years with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia , including 27 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia ( ALL ) and 16 patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) .
Bendamustine hydrochloride was administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of each 21 - day cycle .
There was no treatment response ( CR + CRp ) in any patient .
The safety profile in these patients was consistent with that seen in adults and no new safety signals were identified .
The pharmacokinetics of bendamustine in 43 patients , aged 1 to 19 years ( median age of 10 years ) were within range of values previously observed in adults given the same dose based on body surface area .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety were observed between patients ≥ 65 years of age and younger patients .
Efficacy was lower in patients 65 and over with CLL receiving bendamustine hydrochloride based upon an overall response rate of 47 % for patients 65 and over and 70 % for younger patients .
Progression free survival was also longer in younger patients with CLL receiving bendamustine ( 19 months vs . 12 months ) .
No overall differences in efficacy in patients with non - Hodgkin Lymphoma were observed between geriatric patients and younger patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Do not use VIVIMUSTA in patients with creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) less than 30 mL / min [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Do not use VIVIMUSTA in patients with AST or ALT 2 . 5 to 10 times upper limit of normal ( ULN ) and total bilirubin 1 . 5 to 3 times ULN or total bilirubin greater than 3 times ULN [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] 10 OVERDOSAGE The intravenous lethal dose 50 ( LD50 ) of bendamustine hydrochloride is 240 mg / m2 in the mouse and rat .
Toxicities included sedation , tremor , ataxia , convulsions and respiratory distress .
Across all clinical experience , the reported maximum single dose received was 280 mg / m2 .
Three of four patients who received this dose showed ECG changes considered dose - limiting at 7 and 21 days post - dosing .
These changes included QT prolongation ( one patient ) , sinus tachycardia ( one patient ) , ST and T wave deviations ( two patients ) and left anterior fascicular block ( one patient ) .
Cardiac enzymes and ejection fractions remained normal in all patients .
No specific antidote for bendamustine hydrochloride overdose is known .
Management of overdosage should include general supportive measures , including monitoring of hematologic parameters and ECGs .
11 DESCRIPTION Bendamustine hydrochloride is an alkylating agent .
The chemical name of bendamustine hydrochloride monohydrate is 5 - [ Bis ( 2 - chloroethyl ) - amino ] - 1 - methyl - 1 H - benzimidazole - 2 - butanoic acid hydrochloride monohydrate .
Its empirical molecular formula is C16H21Cl2N3O2 ∙ HCl . H2O and the molecular weight is 412 . 74 .
Bendamustine hydrochloride monohydrate contains a mechlorethamine group and a benzimidazole heterocyclic ring with a butyric acid substituent , and has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] VIVIMUSTA ( bendamustine hydrochloride injection ) is intended for intravenous use after dilution with either 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP or 2 . 5 % Dextrose / 0 . 45 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP .
It is supplied as a sterile , clear , and colorless to yellow solution in a clear glass multiple - dose vial .
Each millilitre contains 25 mg of bendamustine hydrochloride equivalent to 22 . 7 mg of bendamustine , 5 mg of monothioglycerol , 39 . 45 mg dehydrated alcohol , and q . s . to 1 mL polyethylene glycol 400 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Bendamustine is a bifunctional mechlorethamine derivative containing a purine - like benzimidazole ring .
Mechlorethamine and its derivatives form electrophilic alkyl groups .
These groups form covalent bonds with electron - rich nucleophilic moieties , resulting in interstrand DNA crosslinks .
The bifunctional covalent linkage can lead to cell death via several pathways .
Bendamustine is active against both quiescent and dividing cells .
The exact mechanism of action of bendamustine remains unknown .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Based on the pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics analyses of data from adult patients with NHL , nausea increased with increasing bendamustine maximum concentrations ( Cmax ) .
Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of bendamustine on the QTc interval was evaluated in 53 patients with indolent NHL and mantle cell lymphoma on Day 1 of Cycle 1 after administration of rituximab at 375 mg / m2 intravenous infusion followed by a 30 - minute intravenous infusion of bendamustine at 90 mg / m2 / day .
No mean changes greater than 20 milliseconds were detected up to one hour post infusion .
The potential for delayed effects on the QT interval after one hour was not evaluated .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single IV dose of bendamustine hydrochloride Cmax typically occurred at the end of infusion .
The dose proportionality of bendamustine has not been studied .
Distribution The protein binding of bendamustine ranged from 94 - 96 % and was concentration independent from 1 to 50 μg / mL .
The blood to plasma concentration ratios in human blood ranged from 0 . 84 to 0 . 86 over a concentration range of 10 to 100 μg / mL .
The mean steady - state volume of distribution ( Vss ) of bendamustine was approximately 20 to 25 L . Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 120 mg / m2 of bendamustine over 1 hour , the intermediate half - life ( t ½ ) of the parent compound was approximately 40 minutes .
The mean terminal elimination t ½ of two active metabolites , γ - hydroxybendamustine ( M3 ) and N desmethylbendamustine ( M4 ) were approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes , respectively .
Bendamustine clearance in humans was approximately 700 mL / min .
Metabolism Bendamustine is extensively metabolized via hydrolytic , oxidative , and conjugative pathways .
Bendamustine is primarily metabolized via hydrolysis to monohydroxy ( HP1 ) and dihydroxy - bendamustine ( HP2 ) metabolites with low cytotoxic activity in vitro .
Two active minor metabolites , M3 and M4 , are primarily formed via CYP1A2 in vitro .
M3 and M4 concentrations of these metabolites in plasma are 1 / 10 th and 1 / 100 th that of the parent compound , respectively .
Excretion Following intravenous infusion of radiolabeled bendamustine hydrochloride in patients with cancer , approximately 76 % of the dose was recovered .
Approximately 50 % of the dose was recovered in the urine ( 3 . 3 % unchanged ) and approximately 25 % of the dose was recovered in the feces .
Less than 1 % of the dose was recovered in the urine as M3 and M4 , and less than 5 % of the dose was recovered in the urine as HP2 .
Specific Populations No clinically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine were observed based on age ( 31 to 84 years ) , sex , mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr ≥ 30 mL / min ) , or hepatic impairment with total bilirubin 1 . 5 < ULN and AST or ALT < 2 . 5 × ULN .
The effects of severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) , or hepatic impairment with total bilirubin 1 . 5 to 3 × ULN and AST or ALT 2 . 5 to 10 × ULN or total bilirubin > 3 × ULN on the pharmacokinetics of bendamustine is unknown .
Race / Ethnicity Exposures in Japanese subjects ( n = 6 ) were 40 % higher than non - Japanese subjects receiving the same dose .
The clinical importance of this difference on the safety and efficacy of bendamustine hydrochloride in Japanese subjects has not been established .
Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies Effect of Bendamustine Hydrochloride on CYP Substrates : Bendamustine hydrochloride did not inhibit CYP1A2 , 2C9 / 10 , 2D6 , 2E1 , or 3A4 / 5 .
Bendamustine hydrochloride did not induce metabolism of CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2E1 , or CYP3A4 / 5 .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility Bendamustine was carcinogenic in mice .
After intraperitoneal injections at 37 . 5 mg / m2 / day ( the lowest dose tested , approximately 0 . 3 times the maximum recommended human dose [ MRHD ] ) and 75 mg / m2 / day ( approximately 0 . 6 times the MRHD ) for 4 days , peritoneal sarcomas in female AB / jena mice were produced .
Oral administration at 187 . 5 mg / m2 / day ( the only dose tested , approximately 1 . 6 times the MRHD ) for 4 days induced mammary carcinomas and pulmonary adenomas .
Bendamustine is a mutagen and clastogen .
In a reverse bacterial mutation assay ( Ames assay ) , bendamustine was shown to increase revertant frequency in the absence and presence of metabolic activation .
Bendamustine was clastogenic in human lymphocytes in vitro , and in rat bone marrow cells in vivo ( increase in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes ) from 37 . 5 mg / m2 , ( the lowest dose tested , approximately 0 . 3 times the MRHD ) .
Bendamustine induced morphologic abnormalities in spermatozoa in mice .
Following tail vein injection of bendamustine at 120 mg / m2 or a saline control on days 1 and 2 for a total of three weeks , the number of spermatozoa with morphologic abnormalities was 16 % higher in the bendamustine - treated group as compared to the saline control group .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) The efficacy of bendamustine hydrochloride was evaluated in an open - label , randomized , controlled multicenter trial comparing bendamustine hydrochloride to chlorambucil .
The trial was conducted in 301 previously - untreated patients with Binet Stage B or C ( Rai Stages I - IV ) CLL requiring treatment .
Need - to - treat criteria included hematopoietic insufficiency , B - symptoms , rapidly progressive disease or risk of complications from bulky lymphadenopathy .
Patients with autoimmune hemolytic anemia or autoimmune thrombocytopenia , Richter ’ s syndrome , or transformation to prolymphocytic leukemia were excluded from the study .
Patients were randomly assigned to receive either bendamustine hydrochloride 100 mg / m2 intravenously over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 2 of each 28 - day cycle or chlorambucil 0 . 8 mg / kg ( Broca ’ s normal weight ) orally on Days 1 and 15 of each 28 - day cycle .
The patient populations in the bendamustine hydrochloride and chlorambucil treatment groups were balanced with regard to the following baseline characteristics : age ( median 63 vs . 66 years ) , sex ( 63 % vs . 61 % male ) , Binet stage ( 71 % vs . 69 % Binet B ) , lymphadenopathy ( 79 % vs . 82 % ) , enlarged spleen ( 76 % vs . 80 % ) , enlarged liver ( 48 % vs . 46 % ) , hypercellular bone marrow ( 79 % vs . 73 % ) , “ B ” symptoms ( 51 % vs . 53 % ) , lymphocyte count ( mean 65 . 7 x 109 / L vs . 65 . 1 x 109 / L ) , and serum lactate dehydrogenase concentration ( mean 370 . 2 vs . 388 . 4 U / L ) .
Ninety percent of patients in both treatment groups had immuno - phenotypic confirmation of CLL ( CD5 , CD23 and either CD19 or CD20 or both ) .
Efficacy endpoints of objective response rate and progression - free survival were calculated using a pre - specified algorithm based on NCI working group criteria for CLL .
The results of this open - label randomized study demonstrated a higher rate of overall response and a longer progression - free survival for bendamustine hydrochloride compared to chlorambucil ( see Table 6 ) .
Survival data are not mature .

Progression - Free Survival [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Non - Hodgkin Lymphoma ( NHL ) The efficacy of bendamustine hydrochloride was evaluated in a single arm study of 100 patients with indolent B - cell NHL that had progressed during or within six months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab - containing regimen .
Patients were included if they relapsed within 6 months of either the first dose ( monotherapy ) or last dose ( maintenance regimen or combination therapy ) of rituximab .
All patients received bendamustine hydrochloride 120 mg / m2 intravenously on Days 1 and 2 of a 21 - day treatment cycle for up to 8 cycles .
The median age was 60 years , 65 % were male , and 95 % had a baseline WHO performance status of 0 or 1 .
Major tumor subtypes were follicular lymphoma ( 62 % ) , diffuse small lymphocytic lymphoma ( 21 % ) , and marginal zone lymphoma ( 16 % ) .
Ninety - nine percent of patients had received previous chemotherapy , 91 % of patients had received previous alkylator therapy , and 97 % of patients had relapsed within 6 months of either the first dose ( monotherapy ) or last dose ( maintenance regimen or combination therapy ) of rituximab .
Efficacy was based on the assessments by a blinded independent review committee ( IRC ) and included overall response rate ( complete response + complete response unconfirmed + partial response ) and duration of response ( DR ) as summarized in Table 7 .
