To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules and other antibacterial drugs , minocycline hydrochloride capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria .
DESCRIPTION Minocycline hydrochloride is a semisynthetic derivative of tetracycline , 4 , 7 - Bis ( dimethylamino ) - 1 , 4 , 4 a , 5 , 5 a , 6 , 11 , 12 a - octahydro - 3 , 10 , 12 , 12 a - tetrahydroxy - 1 , 11 - dioxo - 2 - naphthacenecarboxamide monohydrochloride .
Its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] C 23 H 27 N 3 O 7 • HCl M . W . 493 . 94 Each minocycline hydrochloride capsule , USP for oral administration , contains the equivalent of 50 mg , 75 mg , or 100 mg of minocycline .
In addition each capsule contains the following inactive ingredients : magnesium stearate and starch ( corn ) .
The 50 mg , 75 mg , and 100 mg capsule shells contain : D & C Red No . 28 , D & C Yellow No . 10 , gelatin , silicon dioxide , sodium lauryl sulfate and titanium dioxide .
The 100 mg capsule shell also contains black iron oxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a single dose of two 100 mg capsules of minocycline HCl administered to 18 normal fasting adult volunteers , maximum serum concentrations were attained in 1 to 4 hours ( average 2 . 1 hours ) and ranged from 2 . 1 to 5 . 1 mcg / mL ( average 3 . 5 mcg / mL ) .
The serum half - life in the normal volunteers ranged from 11 . 1 to 22 . 1 hours ( average 15 . 5 hours ) .
When minocycline hydrochloride capsules were given concomitantly with a high - fat meal , which included dairy products , the extent of absorption of minocycline hydrochloride capsules was unchanged compared to dosing under fasting conditions .
The mean T max was delayed by one hour when administered with food , compared to dosing under fasting conditions .
Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be administered with or without food .
In previous studies with other minocycline dosage forms , the minocycline serum half - life ranged from 11 to 16 hours in 7 patients with hepatic dysfunction , and from 18 to 69 hours in 5 patients with renal dysfunction .
The urinary and fecal recovery of minocycline when administered to 12 normal volunteers was one - half to one - third that of other tetracyclines .
Microbiology Mechanism of Action The tetracyclines are primarily bacteriostatic and are thought to exert their antimicrobial effect by the inhibition of protein synthesis .
The tetracyclines , including minocycline , have a similar antimicrobial spectrum of activity against a wide range of gram - positive and gram - negative organisms .
Cross - resistance of these organisms to tetracycline is common .
Antimicrobial Activity Minocycline has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section : Gram - positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Gram - negative Bacteria Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Klebsiella granulomatis Campylobacter fetus Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Vibrio cholerae Yersinia pestis Acinetobacter species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae1 Neisseria meningitidis1 Shigella species Other Microorganisms Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Clostridium species Entamoeba species Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies fusiforme Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae Propionibacterium acnes Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Test Methods When available , the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative reports of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community - acquired pathogens .
These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antibacterial drug for treatment .
Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations ( MICs ) .
These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds .
The MICs should be determined using a standardized test method ( broth or agar ) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of tetracycline ( class ) or minocycline powder .
1 , 2 The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 1 .
Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds .
The zone size provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds .
The zone size should be determined using a standardized method .
2 , 3 This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg tetracycline ( class disk ) or 30 mcg minocycline to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to minocycline .
The disk diffusion interpretive criteria are provided in Table 1 .

However , some organisms that are intermediate or resistant to tetracycline may be susceptible to minocycline .
bThe current absence of resistance isolates precludes defining any result other than “ susceptible ” .
If isolates yielding MIC results other than susceptible , they should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing .
A report of Susceptible ( S ) indicates that the antimicrobial drug is likely to inhibit growth of the microorganism if the antimicrobial drug reaches the concentration usually achievable at the site of infection .
A report of Intermediate ( I ) indicates that the result should be considered equivocal , and , if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative , clinically feasible drugs , the test should be repeated .
This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used .
This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation .
A report of Resistant ( R ) indicates that the antimicrobial drug is not likely to inhibit growth of the microorganism , if the antimicrobial drug reaches the concentrations usually achievable at the infection site ; other therapy should be selected .
Quality Control Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay , and the techniques of the individuals performing the test .
1 - 3 Standard tetracycline ( class compound ) or minocycline powder should provide the following range of MIC values noted in Table 2 .
For the disc diffusion technique , using the 30 mcg tetracycline or 30 mcg minocycline disk , the criteria in Table 2 should be achieved .

In severe acne , minocycline may be useful adjunctive therapy .
Oral minocycline is indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis to eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx .
In order to preserve the usefulness of minocycline in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal carriers , diagnostic laboratory procedures , including serotyping and susceptibility testing , should be performed to establish the carrier state and the correct treatment .
It is recommended that the prophylactic use of minocycline be reserved for situations in which the risk of meningococcal meningitis is high .
Oral minocycline is not indicated for the treatment of meningococcal infection .
Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted , limited clinical data show that oral minocycline hydrochloride has been used successfully in the treatment of infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum .
To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of minocycline hydrochloride capsules and other antibacterial drugs , minocycline hydrochloride capsules should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria .
When culture and susceptibility information are available , they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy .
In the absence of such data , local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy .
CONTRAINDICATIONS This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines or to any of the components of the product formulation .
WARNINGS Tooth Development Minocycline , like other tetracycline - class antibiotics , can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
If any tetracycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus .
The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development ( last half of pregnancy , infancy , and childhood to the age of 8 years ) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth ( yellow - gray - brown ) .
This adverse reaction is more common during long - term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short - term courses .
Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported .
Tetracycline drugs , therefore , should not be used during tooth development unless other drugs are not likely to be effective or are contraindicated .
Skeletal Development All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone - forming tissue .
A decrease in the fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg / kg every six hours .
This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued .
Use in Pregnancy Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta , are found in fetal tissues , and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus ( often related to retardation of skeletal development ) .
Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy .
Dermatologic Reaction Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms ( DRESS ) including fatal cases has been reported with minocycline use .
If this syndrome is recognized , the drug should be discontinued immediately .
Antianabolic Action The antianabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) .
While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function , in patients with significantly impaired function , higher serum levels of tetracycline may lead to azotemia , hyperphosphatemia , and acidosis .
Under such conditions , monitoring of creatinine and BUN is recommended , and the total daily dosage should not exceed 200 mg in 24 hours ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
If renal impairment exists , even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to systemic accumulation of the drug and possible liver toxicity .
Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines .
This has been reported with minocycline .
Central Nervous System Central nervous system side effects including lightheadedness , dizziness , or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy .
Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy .
These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually disappear rapidly when the drug is discontinued .
Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including minocycline , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibiotic treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial hypertension ( IH , pseudotumor cerebri ) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including minocycline .
Clinical manifestations of IH include headache , blurred vision , diplopia , and vision loss ; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy .
Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline - associated IH .
Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri .
Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment , the possibility for permanent visual loss exists .
If visual disturbance occurs during treatment , prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted .
Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation , patients should be monitored until they stabilize .
PRECAUTIONS General As with other antibiotic preparations , use of this drug may result in overgrowth of non - susceptible organisms , including fungi .
If superinfection occurs , the antibiotic should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted .
Hepatotoxicity has been reported with minocycline ; therefore , minocycline should be used with caution in patients with hepatic dysfunction and in conjunction with other hepatotoxic drugs .
Incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy when indicated .
Prescribing minocycline hydrochloride capsules in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria .
Information for Patients Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued .
Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics , patients can develop watery and bloody stools ( with or without stomach cramps and fever ) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic .
If this occurs , patients should contact their physician as soon as possible .
Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines .
Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs , and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema .
This reaction has been reported with use of minocycline .
Patients who experience central nervous system symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy ( see WARNINGS ) .
Concurrent use of tetracycline with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective ( see PRECAUTIONS - Drug Interactions ) .
Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including minocycline hydrochloride capsules should only be used to treat bacterial infections .
They do not treat viral infections ( e . g . , the common cold ) .
When minocycline hydrochloride capsules are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection , patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy , the medication should be taken exactly as directed .
Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may ( 1 ) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and ( 2 ) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by minocycline hydrochloride capsules or other antibacterial drugs in the future .
Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date .
Laboratory Tests In venereal disease when coexistent syphilis is suspected , a dark - field examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least four months .
Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems , including hematopoietic , renal , and hepatic , should be performed .
Drug Interactions Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity , patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage .
Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin , it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline - class drugs in conjunction with penicillin .
Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum , calcium , or magnesium , and iron - containing preparations .
The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity .
Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective .
Administration of isotretinoin should be avoided shortly before , during , and shortly after minocycline therapy .
Each drug alone has been associated with pseudotumor cerebri ( see WARNINGS ) .
Increased risk of ergotism when ergot alkaloids or their derivatives are given with tetracyclines .
Drug / Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Dietary administration of minocycline in long - term tumorigenicity studies in rats resulted in evidence of thyroid tumor production .
Minocycline has also been found to produce thyroid hyperplasia in rats and dogs .
In addition , there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with a related antibiotic , oxytetracycline ( i . e . , adrenal and pituitary tumors ) .
Likewise , although mutagenicity studies of minocycline have not been conducted , positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays ( i . e . , mouse lymphoma and Chinese hamster lung cells ) have been reported for related antibiotics ( tetracycline hydrochloride and oxytetracycline ) .
Segment I ( fertility and general reproduction ) studies have provided evidence that minocycline impairs fertility in male rats .
Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects , loss , or other adverse outcome regardless of drug exposure .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women .
Minocycline , like other tetracycline - class antibiotics , crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported in postmarketing experience .
Only limited information is available regarding these reports ; therefore , no conclusion on causal association can be established .
If minocycline is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus .
Nonteratogenic Effects ( See WARNINGS . )
Labor and Delivery The effect of tetracyclines on labor and delivery is unknown .
Nursing Mothers Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from the tetracyclines , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother ( see WARNINGS ) .
Pediatric Use Minocycline is not recommended for the use in children below 8 years of age unless the expected benefits of therapy outweigh the risks ( see WARNINGS ) .
Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oral minocycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy ( see WARNINGSand DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Due to oral minocycline ’ s virtually complete absorption , side effects to the lower bowel , particularly diarrhea , have been infrequent .

What are minocycline hydrochloride capsules ?
Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are a tetracycline - class antibiotic medicine .
Minocycline hydrochloride capsules are used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria .
These include infections of the skin , respiratory tract , urinary tract , some sexually transmitted diseases , and others .
Minocycline hydrochloride capsules may be used along with other treatments for severe acne .
Sometimes other germs , called viruses , cause infections .
