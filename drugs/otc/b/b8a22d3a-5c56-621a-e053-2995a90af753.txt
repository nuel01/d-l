Sodium sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide with antibacterial activity while sulfur acts as a keratolytic agent .
Sodium sulfacetamide is C 8 H 9 N 2 NaO 3 S · H 2 O with molecular weight of 254 . 24 .
Chemically , sodium sulfacetamide is N - [ ( 4 - aminophenyl ) sulfonyl ] - acetamide , monosodium salt , monohydrate .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Sodium sulfacetamide is an odorless , white , crystalline powder with a bitter taste .
It is freely soluble in water , sparingly soluble in alcohol , while practically insoluble in benzene , in chloroform and in ether .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : The most widely accepted mechanism of action of sulfonamides is the Woods - Fildes theory , which is based on the fact that sulfonamides act as competitive antagonists to para - aminobenzoic acid ( PABA ) , an essential component for bacterial growth .
While absorption through intact skin has not been determined , sodium sulfacetamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally and excreted in the urine , largely unchanged .
The biological half - life has variously been reported as 7 to 12 . 8 hours .
The exact mode of action of sulfur in the treatment of acne is unknown , but it has been reported that it inhibits the growth of Propionibacterium acnes and the formation of free fatty acids .
INDICATIONS : This product is indicated for use in the topical control of acne vulgaris , acne rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis .

Systemic toxic reactions such as agranulocytosis , acute hemolytic anemia , purpura hemorrhagica , drug fever , jaundice and contact dermatitis indicate hypersensitivity to sulfonamides .
Particular caution should be employed if areas of denuded or abraded skin are involved .
Systemic absorption of topical sulfonamides is greater following application to large , infected , abraded , denuded or severely burned areas .
Under these circumstances , any of the adverse effects produced by the systemic administration of these agents could potentially occur , and appropriate observations and laboratory determinations should be performed .
The object of this therapy is to achieve desquamation without irritation , but sodium sulfacetamide and sulfur can cause reddening and scaling of the epidermis .
