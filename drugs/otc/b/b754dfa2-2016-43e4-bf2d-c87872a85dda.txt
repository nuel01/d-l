The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinylchloride .
Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts ; however , biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials .
Exposure to temperatures above 25 ° C / 77 ° F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content .
Higher temperatures lead to greater losses .
It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period .
The formulas for the individual amino acids are as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The Pharmacy Bulk Package is designed for use with manual , gravity flow operations and automated compounding devices for preparing sterile parenteral nutrient admixtures ; it contains no bacteriostat .
Multiple single doses may be dispensed during continual aliquoting operations .
Withdrawal of container contents should be promptly completed within 4 hours after initial closure puncture .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Aminosyn II , Sulfite - Free , ( an amino acid injection ) provides crystalline amino acids to promote protein synthesis and wound healing , and to reduce the rate of endogenous protein catabolism .
Aminosyn II , given by central venous infusion in combination with concentrated dextrose , electrolytes , vitamins , trace metals , and ancillary fat supplements , constitutes total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) .
Aminosyn II can also be administered by peripheral vein with dextrose and maintenance electrolytes .
Intravenous fat emulsion may be substituted for part of the carbohydrate calories during either TPN or peripheral vein administration of Aminosyn II .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Aminosyn II , Sulfite - Free , ( an amino acid injection ) infused with dextrose by peripheral vein infusion is indicated as a source of nitrogen in the nutritional support of patients with adequate stores of body fat , in whom , for short periods of time , oral nutrition cannot be tolerated , is undesirable , or inadequate .
SUPPLEMENTAL ELECTROLYTES , IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRESCRIPTION OF THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN , MUST BE ADDED TO AMINOSYN II SOLUTIONS WITHOUT ELECTROLYTES .
Aminosyn II can be administered peripherally with dilute ( 5 to 10 % ) dextrose solution and I . V . fat emulsion as a source of nutritional support .
This form of nutritional support can help to preserve protein and reduce catabolism in stress conditions where oral intake is inadequate .
Aminosyn II is also indicated for central vein infusion to prevent or reverse negative nitrogen balance in patients where the alimentary tract , by the oral , gastrostomy or jejunostomy route cannot or should not be used and gastrointestinal absorption of protein is impaired .
CONTRAINDICATIONS This preparation should not be used in patients with hepatic coma or metabolic disorders involving impaired nitrogen utilization .
WARNINGS Intravenous infusion of amino acids may induce a rise in blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , especially in patients with impaired hepatic or renal function .
Appropriate laboratory tests should be performed periodically and infusion discontinued if BUN levels exceed normal postprandial limits and continue to rise .
It should be noted that a modest rise in BUN normally occurs as a result of increased protein intake .
Administration of amino acid solutions to a patient with hepatic insufficiency may result in serum amino acid imbalances , metabolic alkalosis , prerenal azotemia , hyperammonemia , stupor and coma .
Administration of amino acid solutions in the presence of impaired renal function may augment an increasing BUN , as does any protein dietary component .
Solutions containing sodium ion should be used with great care , if at all , in patients with congestive heart failure , severe renal insufficiency and in clinical states in which there exists edema with sodium retention .
Solutions which contain potassium ion should be used with great care , if at all , in patients with hyperkalemia , severe renal failure and in conditions in which potassium retention is present .
Solutions containing acetate ion should be used with great care in patients with metabolic or respiratory alkalosis .
Acetate should be administered with great care in those conditions in which there is an increased level or an impaired utilization of this ion , such as severe hepatic insufficiency .
Hyperammonemia is of special significance in infants , as it can result in mental retardation .
Therefore , it is essential that blood ammonia levels be measured frequently in infants .
Instances of asymptomatic hyperammonemia have been reported in patients without overt liver dysfunction .
The mechanisms of this reaction are not clearly defined , but may involve genetic defects and immature or subclinically impaired liver function .
WARNING : This product contains aluminum that may be toxic .
Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired .
Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature , and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions , which contain aluminum .
Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function , including premature neonates , who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg / kg / day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity .
Tissue loading may occur even at lower rates of administration .
PRECAUTIONS Special care must be taken when administering glucose to provide calories in diabetic or prediabetic patients .
Feeding regimens which include amino acids should be used with caution in patients with history of renal disease , pulmonary disease , or with cardiac insufficiency so as to avoid excessive fluid accumulation .
The effect of infusion of amino acids , without dextrose , upon carbohydrate metabolism of children is not known at this time .
Nitrogen intake should be carefully monitored in patients with impaired renal function .
For long - term total nutrition , or if a patient has inadequate fat stores , it is essential to provide adequate exogenous calories concurrently with the amino acids .
Concentrated dextrose solutions are an effective source of such calories .
Such strongly hypertonic nutrient solutions should be administered through an indwelling intravenous catheter with the tip located in the superior vena cava .
SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR CENTRAL VENOUS INFUSIONS ADMINISTRATION BY CENTRAL VENOUS CATHETER SHOULD BE USED ONLY BY THOSE FAMILIAR WITH THIS TECHNIQUE AND ITS COMPLICATIONS .
Central vein infusion ( with added concentrated carbohydrate solutions ) of amino acid solutions requires a knowledge of nutrition as well as clinical expertise in recognition and treatment of complications .
Attention must be given to solution preparation , administration and patient monitoring .
IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT A CAREFULLY PREPARED PROTOCOL BASED ON CURRENT MEDICAL PRACTICES BE FOLLOWED , PREFERABLY BY AN EXPERIENCED TEAM .
SUMMARY HIGHLIGHTS OF COMPLICATIONS ( consult current medical literature ) .
• Technical : The placement of a central venous catheter should be regarded as a surgical procedure .
One should be fully acquainted with various techniques of catheter insertion .
For details of technique and placement sites , consult the medical literature .
X - ray is the best means of verifying catheter placement .
Complications known to occur from the placement of central venous catheters are pneumothorax , hemothorax , hydrothorax , artery puncture and transection , injury to the brachial plexus , malposition of the catheter , formation of arteriovenous fistula , phlebitis , thrombosis and air and catheter emboli .
• Septic : The constant risk of sepsis is present during administration of total parenteral nutrition .
It is imperative that the preparation of the solution and the placement and care of catheters be accomplished under strict aseptic conditions .
Solutions should ideally be prepared in the hospital pharmacy in a laminar flow hood using careful aseptic technique to avoid inadvertent touch contamination .
Solutions should be used promptly after mixing .
Storage should be under refrigeration and limited to a brief period of time , preferably less than 24 hours .
Administration time for a single container and set should never exceed 24 hours .
• Metabolic : The following metabolic complications have been reported with TPN administration : metabolic acidosis and alkalosis , hypophosphatemia , hypocalcemia , osteoporosis , glycosuria , hyperglycemia , hyperosmolar nonketotic states and dehydration , rebound hypoglycemia , osmotic diuresis and dehydration , elevated liver enzymes , hypo - and hypervitaminosis , electrolyte imbalances and hyperammonemia in pediatric patients .
Frequent evaluations are necessary especially during the first few days of therapy to prevent or minimize these complications .
Administration of glucose at a rate exceeding the patient ’ s utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia , coma and death .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Studies with solutions from flexible plastic containers have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , mutagenic potential or effects on fertility .
Pregnancy Category C . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Aminosyn II ( an amino acid injection ) .
It is not known whether Aminosyn II can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Aminosyn II should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers : Caution should be exercised when solutions from flexible plastic containers are administered to a nursing mother .
Geriatric Use : Clinical Studies of Aminosyn II have not been performed to determine whether patients over 65 years of age respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by kidney , and the risk for adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
Pediatric Use : Safety and effectiveness of solutions from flexible plastic containers in pediatric patients have not been well established .
CLINICAL EVALUATION AND LABORATORY DETERMINATIONS , AT THE DISCRETION OF THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN , ARE NECESSARY FOR PROPER MONITORING DURING ADMINISTRATION .
Do not withdraw venous blood for blood chemistries through the peripheral infusion site , as interference with estimations of nitrogen containing substances may occur .
Blood studies should include glucose , urea nitrogen , serum electrolytes , ammonia , cholesterol , acid - base balance , serum proteins , kidney and liver function tests , osmolarity and hemogram .
White blood count and blood cultures are to be determined if indicated .
Urinary osmolality and glucose should be determined as necessary .
Drug Interactions Because of its antianabolic activity , concurrent administration of tetracycline may reduce the potential effects of amino acids infused with dextrose as part of a parenteral feeding regimen .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Peripheral Infusions A 3 . 5 % to 5 % solution of amino acids ( without additives ) is slightly hypertonic .
Use of large peripheral veins , inline filters , and slowing the rate of infusion may reduce the incidence of local venous irritation .
Electrolyte additives should be spread throughout the day .
Irritating additive medications may need to be infused at another venous site .
Generalized flushing , fever and nausea also have been reported during peripheral infusions of amino acid solutions .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of overhydration or solute overload , re - evaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective measures .
( See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS . )
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Each 100 mL of Aminosyn II contains : Amino Acids Nitrogen Aminosyn II 10 % 10 g 1 . 53 g Aminosyn II 15 % 15 g 2 . 30 g The total daily dose of the solution depends on the daily protein requirements and on the patient ’ s metabolic and clinical response .
In many patients , provision of adequate calories in the form of hypertonic dextrose may require the administration of exogenous insulin to prevent hyperglycemia and glycosuria .
To prevent rebound hypoglycemia , a solution containing 5 % dextrose should be administered when hypertonic dextrose infusions are abruptly discontinued .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
COLOR VARIATION FROM PALE YELLOW TO YELLOW IS NORMAL AND DOES NOT ALTER EFFICACY .
Some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed .
This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety .
The opacity will diminish gradually .
Aminosyn II in the 2000 mL flexible Pharmacy Bulk Package is designed for use with manual , gravity flow operations and automated gravimetric compounding devices for preparing intravenous nutritional admixtures .
Admixtures must be stored under refrigeration and used within 24 hours of admixing .
• Peripheral Vein Nutritional Maintenance A mixture of Aminosyn II and dextrose diluted to a final concentration of 5 % to 10 % amino acids and 5 % to 10 % dextrose is suitable for administration by peripheral vein .
This solution is not intended for central vein administration because it does not contain adequate amounts of amino acids or electrolytes .
For peripheral intravenous infusion , 1 to 1 . 5 g / kg / day of total amino acids will reduce protein catabolism .
Infusion or ingestion of carbohydrate or lipid will not reduce the nitrogen sparing effect of intravenous amino acid infusions at this dose .
As with all intravenous fluid therapy , the primary aim is to provide sufficient water to compensate for insensible , urinary and other ( nasogastric suction , fistula drainage , diarrhea ) fluid losses .
Total fluid requirements , as well as electrolyte and acid - base needs , should be estimated and appropriately administered .
For an amino acid solution of specified total concentration , the volume required to meet amino acid requirements per 24 hours can be calculated .
After making an estimate of the total daily fluid ( water ) requirement , the balance of fluid needed beyond the volume of amino acid solution required can be provided either as a noncarbohydrate or a carbohydrate - containing electrolyte solution .
I . V . lipid emulsion may be substituted for part of the carbohydrate - containing solution .
Vitamins and additional electrolytes as needed for maintenance or to correct imbalances may be added to the amino acid solution .
If desired , only one - half of an estimated daily amino acid requirement of 1 . 5 g / kg can be given on the first day .
Amino acids together with dextrose in concentrations of 5 % to 10 % infused into a peripheral vein can be continued while oral nutrition is impaired .
However , if a patient is unable to take oral nourishment for a prolonged period of time , institution of total parenteral nutrition with exogenous calories should be considered .
• Central Vein Total Parenteral Nutrition For central vein infusion with concentrated dextrose solution , alone or with I . V . lipid , the total daily dose of the amino acid solution depends upon daily protein requirements and the patient ’ s metabolic and clinical response .
The determination of nitrogen balance and accurate daily body weights , corrected for fluid balance , are probably the best means of assessing individual protein requirements .
ADULTS Solutions containing 3 . 5 to 5 % amino acids with 5 to 10 % glucose may be infused with a fat emulsion by peripheral vein to provide approximately 1400 to 2000 kcal / day .
Fat emulsion administration should be considered when prolonged parenteral nutrition is required in order to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency ( E . F . A . D . ) .
Serum lipids should be monitored for evidence of E . F . A . D . in patients maintained on fat - free TPN .
Aminosyn II solution should only be infused via a central vein when admixed with sufficient dextrose to provide full caloric requirements in patients who require prolonged total parenteral nutrition .
I . V . lipid may be administered to provide part of the calories , if desired .
Serum lipids should be monitored for evidence of essential fatty acid deficiency in patients maintained on fat - free TPN .
Total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) may be started with 10 % dextrose added to the calculated daily requirement of amino acids ( 1 . 5 g / kg for a metabolically stable patient ) .
Dextrose content is gradually increased over the next few days to the estimated daily caloric need as the patient adapts to the increasing amounts of dextrose .
Each gram of dextrose provides approximately 3 . 4 kcal .
Each gram of fat provides 9 kcal .
The average depleted major surgical patient with complications requires between 2500 and 4000 kcal and between 12 and 24 grams of nitrogen per day .
An adult patient in an acceptable weight range with restricted activity who is not hypermetabolic , requires about 30 kcal / kg of body weight / day .
Average daily adult fluid requirements are between 2500 and 3000 mL and may be much higher with losses from fistula drainage or severe burns .
Typically , a hospitalized patient may lose 12 to 18 grams of nitrogen a day , and in severe trauma the daily loss may be 20 to 25 grams or more .
Aminosyn II solutions without electrolytes are intended for patients requiring individualized electrolyte therapy .
Sodium , chloride , potassium , phosphate , calcium and magnesium are major electrolytes which should be added to Aminosyn II as required .
SERUM ELECTROLYTES SHOULD BE MONITORED AS INDICATED .
Electrolytes may be added to the nutrient solution as indicated by the patient ’ s clinical condition and laboratory determinations of plasma values .
Major electrolytes are sodium , chloride , potassium , phosphate , magnesium and calcium .
Vitamins , including folic acid and vitamin K , are required additives .
The trace element supplements should be given when long - term parenteral nutrition is undertaken .
Iron is added to the solution or given intramuscularly in depot form as indicated .
Vitamin B12 , vitamin K and folic acid are given intramuscularly or added to the solution as desired .
Calcium and phosphorus additives are potentially incompatible when added to the TPN admixture .
In patients with hyperchloremic or other metabolic acidosis , sodium and potassium may be added as the acetate or lactate salts to provide bicarbonate alternates .
In adults , hypertonic mixtures of amino acids and dextrose may be safely administered by continuous infusion through a central venous catheter with the tip located in the vena cava .
Typically , each liter of central vein TPN solution for adults contains 42 . 5 to 50 g of Aminosyn II with approximately 250 ± 100 g of dextrose ; supplementary nonprotein calories from intravenous fat emulsion may be prescribed , at the discretion of the physician .
The rate of intravenous infusion initially should be 2 mL / min and may be increased gradually .
If administration should fall behind schedule , no attempt to “ catch up ” to planned intake should be made .
In addition to meeting protein needs , the rate of administration is governed by the patient ’ s glucose tolerance estimated by glucose levels in blood and urine .
Aminosyn II solution , when mixed with an appropriate volume of concentrated dextrose , offers a higher concentration of calories and nitrogen per unit volume .
This solution is indicated for patients requiring larger amounts of nitrogen than could otherwise be provided or where total fluid load must be kept to a minimum , for example , patients with renal failure .
Provision of adequate calories in the form of hypertonic dextrose may require exogenous insulin to prevent hyperglycemia and glycosuria .
To prevent rebound hypoglycemia , do not abruptly discontinue administration of nutritional solutions .
PEDIATRIC Pediatric requirements for parenteral nutrition are constrained by the greater relative fluid requirements of the infant and greater caloric requirements per kilogram .
Amino acids are probably best administered in a 2 . 5 % concentration .
For most pediatric patients on intravenous nutrition , 2 . 5 grams amino acids / kg / day with dextrose alone or with I . V . lipid calories of 100 to 130 kcal / kg / day is recommended .
In cases of malnutrition or stress , these requirements may be increased .
It is acceptable in pediatrics to start with a nutritional solution of half strength at a rate of about 60 to 70 mL / kg / day .
Within 24 to 48 hours the volume and concentration of the solution can be increased until the full strength pediatric solution ( amino acids and dextrose ) is given at a rate of 125 to 150 mL / kg / day .
Supplemental electrolytes and vitamin additives should be administered as deemed necessary by careful monitoring of blood chemistries and nutritional status .
Addition of iron is more critical in the infant than the adult because of the increasing red cell mass required for the growing infant .
Serum lipids should be monitored for evidence of essential fatty acid deficiency in patients maintained on fat - free TPN .
Bicarbonate should not be administered during infusion of the nutritional solution unless deemed absolutely necessary .
To ensure the precise delivery of the small volumes of fluid necessary for total parenteral nutrition in infants , accurately calibrated and reliable infusion systems should be used .
A basic solution for pediatric use should contain 25 grams of amino acids and 200 to 250 grams of glucose per 1000 mL , administered from containers containing 250 or 500 mL .
Such a solution given at the rate of 145 mL / kg / day provides 130 kcal / kg / day .
