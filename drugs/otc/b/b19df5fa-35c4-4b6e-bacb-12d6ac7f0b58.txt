( 1 . 1 ) 1 . 1 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Orenitram is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) ( WHO Group 1 ) to delay disease progression and to improve exercise capacity .
The studies that established effectiveness included predominately patients with WHO functional class II - III symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH ( 66 % ) or PAH associated with connective tissue disease ( 26 % ) .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Give with food .
Swallow tablets whole ; use only intact tablets .
( 2 . 1 ) • Starting dose : 0 . 125 mg TID or 0 . 25 mg BID .
( 2 . 1 ) • Titrate by 0 . 125 mg TID or by 0 . 25 mg or 0 . 5 mg BID , not more frequently than every 3 to 4 days as tolerated .
( 2 . 1 ) • If transitioning from intravenous ( IV ) or subcutaneous ( SC ) Remodulin ® , the Orenitram dose should be increased while simultaneously decreasing the IV / SC infusion rate .
( 2 . 2 ) • Mild hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh Class A ) : Initiate at 0 . 125 mg BID .
Increment at 0 . 125 mg BID not more frequently than every 3 to 4 days .
( 2 . 3 ) • Avoid use in patients with moderate hepatic impairment .
( 2 . 3 ) 2 . 1 Recommended Dosing Take Orenitram with food .
Swallow Orenitram tablets whole ; do not crush , split , or chew .
The recommended starting dose of Orenitram is 0 . 125 mg three times daily ( TID ) with food , taken approximately 8 hours apart or 0 . 25 mg twice daily ( BID ) with food , taken approximately 12 hours apart .
Titrate by 0 . 125 mg TID or 0 . 25 or 0 . 5 mg BID not more frequently than every 3 to 4 days .
Increase the dose to the highest tolerated dose .
If dose increments are not tolerated , consider titrating slower .
If intolerable pharmacologic effects occur , decrease the dose in increments of 0 . 125 mg TID or 0 . 25 mg BID .
Avoid abrupt discontinuation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 2 Transitioning from Subcutaneous or Intravenous Routes of Administration of Treprostinil Decrease the dose of Remodulin while simultaneously increasing the dose of Orenitram .
The dose of Remodulin can be reduced up to 30 ng / kg / min per day and the dose of Orenitram simultaneously increased up to 6 mg per day ( 2 mg TID ) if tolerated .
The following equation can be used to estimate a target total daily dose of Orenitram in mg using a patient ' s dose of intravenous ( IV ) / subcutaneous ( SC ) treprostinil ( in ng / kg / min ) and weight ( in kg ) .
Orenitram total daily dose ( mg ) = 0 . 0072 × Remodulin dose ( ng / kg / min ) × weight ( kg ) 2 . 3 Dose Adjustment in Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh Class A ) start at 0 . 125 mg BID with 0 . 125 mg BID dose increments not more frequently than every 3 to 4 days .
Avoid use of Orenitram in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh Class B ) .
Orenitram is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh Class C ) due to increases in systemic exposure [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 4 Dose Adjustment for Use with CYP2C8 Inhibitors When co - administered with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors ( e . g . , gemfibrozil ) the initial dose is 0 . 125 mg BID with 0 . 125 mg BID dose increments not more frequently than every 3 to 4 days .
2 . 5 Interruptions and Discontinuation If a dose of medication is missed , the patient should take the missed dose as soon as possible , with food .
If a patient misses two or more doses , restart at a lower dose and re - titrate .
In the event of a planned short - term treatment interruption for patients unable to take oral medications , consider a temporary infusion of subcutaneous or intravenous treprostinil .
To calculate the total daily dose ( mg ) of treprostinil for the parenteral route use the following equation : Remodulin ( ng / kg / min ) = 139 × Orenitram total daily dose ( mg ) weight ( kg ) When discontinuing Orenitram , reduce the dose in steps of 0 . 5 to 1 mg per day [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
In a 12 - week , placebo - controlled , monotherapy study ( Study 1 ; WHO Group 1 ; functional class II - III ) , and an event - driven , placebo - controlled , combination therapy study ( Study 4 ; WHO Group 1 ; functional class I - III ) , the most commonly reported adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving Orenitram included : headache , diarrhea , nausea , and flushing .
Orenitram patients in Study 1 ( N = 151 ) had access to 0 . 25 mg tablets at randomization .
Approximately 91 % of such patients in Study 1 experienced an adverse reaction , but only 4 % discontinued therapy for an adverse reaction ( compared to 3 % receiving placebo ) .
Study 4 enrolled a total of 690 patients , 346 received Orenitram and 344 received placebo .
Overall , 19 % of patients treated with Orenitram discontinued treatment in Study 4 due to an adverse event ( compared to 4 % of patients receiving placebo ) .
The exposure to Orenitram in Study 4 was up to 5 . 1 years with a median duration of exposure of 1 . 2 years .
Table 1 summarizes adverse events with rates at least 5 % higher on Orenitram therapy than on placebo that were reported in either Study 1 or 4 .
Table 1 : Adverse Events with Rates at Least 5 % Higher on Orenitram Therapy than on Placebo in Either Study 1 or Study 4 Reaction Study 1 N = 228 [ 1 ] Study 4 N = 690 Orenitram n = 151 Placebo n = 77 Orenitram n = 346 Placebo n = 344 Headache 63 % 19 % 75 % 35 % Diarrhea 30 % 16 % 69 % 29 % Nausea 30 % 18 % 40 % 23 % Vomiting 17 % 16 % 36 % 10 % Flushing 15 % 6 % 45 % 8 % Pain in jaw 11 % 4 % 18 % 3 % Pain in extremity 14 % 8 % 18 % 9 % Hypokalemia 9 % 3 % 4 % 3 % Abdominal discomfort 6 % 0 % 8 % 4 % Upper abdominal pain 5 % 3 % 12 % 5 % [ 1 ] Includes all subjects in the Primary Analysis Population Orenitram was studied in a long - term , open - label , extension study in which 824 patients were dosed for a mean duration of approximately 2 years .
About 70 % of patients continued treatment with Orenitram for at least a year .
The mean dose was 4 . 2 mg BID at one year .
The adverse reactions were similar to those observed in the placebo - controlled trials .
The safety of Orenitram was also evaluated in an open - label study transitioning patients from Remodulin .
The safety profile during this study was similar to that observed in the three pivotal studies .
6 . 2 Post - Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Orenitram : dizziness , dyspepsia , vomiting , myalgia , and arthralgia .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • When co - administered with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors the initial dose is 0 . 125 mg BID with 0 . 125 mg BID dose increments not more frequently than every 3 to 4 days .
( 2 . 4 , 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Effect of CYP2C8 Inhibitors on Treprostinil Co - administration of Orenitram and the CYP2C8 enzyme inhibitor gemfibrozil in healthy adult volunteers increases exposure to treprostinil .
Reduce the starting dose of Orenitram to 0 . 125 mg BID and use 0 . 125 mg BID increments not more frequently than every 3 to 4 days [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited published data from case reports with Orenitram use in pregnant women are not sufficient to assess for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
There are risks to the mother and the fetus associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
Animal reproductive studies with treprostinil diolamine administered orally have shown an adverse effect on the fetus .
In rats , administration of treprostinil to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses ≥ 10 mg / kg / day ( approximately 15 times the human exposure at the dose of 3 . 5 mg BID on an AUC basis ) resulted in decreased pregnancy rate , increased post - implantation loss , and decreased fetal viability and growth .
In rabbits , teratogenicity and decreased fetal viability and growth were observed at doses ≥ 1 . 5 mg / kg / day ( approximately 7 times the human exposure at the dose of 3 . 5 mg BID on an AUC basis ) ( see Animal Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and embryo - fetal risk Pulmonary arterial hypertension in pregnancy increases the risk of maternal heart failure , stroke and death , preterm delivery , low birth weight , and stillbirth .
Data Animal Data In pregnant rats , reversible , dose - dependent decreases in body weight gain and food consumption were observed during the first four days of dosing in animals administered 10 , 20 , and 30 mg / kg / day treprostinil diolamine .
In a dose range - finding study , there was a 17 % decrease in the pregnancy rate in the animals administered 20 and 30 mg / kg / day .
One dam in each of the 20 and 30 mg / kg / day had litters with no viable fetuses .
In the definitive study ( 0 , 5 , 10 , and 20 mg / kg / day ) , there were four treatment - related deaths , and a 32 % decrease in the pregnancy rate for rats administered 20 mg / kg / day .
There was an 8 % decrease in the pregnancy rate in the animals administered 10 mg / kg / day .
Across both studies , an increase in post - implantation loss was observed in animals administered 10 to 30 mg / kg / day , and a significant decrease in the mean number of live births was seen at dose levels ≥ 10 mg / kg / day .
The no observed adverse effect level was 5 mg / kg / day ( maternal , fetal viability and growth ) , and 20 mg / kg / day ( teratogenicity ) , the highest dose tested in the definitive study .
The exposures at 5 and 20 mg / kg / day doses represent 8 and 33 times , respectively , the human exposure at the dose of 3 . 5 mg BID on an AUC basis .
For F1 progeny , a decreased copulation index was observed at the 5 and 10 mg / kg / day treprostinil diolamine dose levels in rats .
The no observed effect levels for physical development , reflex development , exploratory behavior , learning and memory , and sexual maturation was 10 mg / kg / day .
The no observed effect level for F1 progeny general development ( based on body weight ) was 10 mg / kg / day for females and ≤ 2 . 5 mg / kg / day for males ; the no observed effect level for F1 reproductive performance was 2 . 5 mg / kg / day ( approximately 4 times the human exposure at the dose of 3 . 5 mg BID on an AUC basis ) .
In pregnant rabbits , the primary maternal adverse effect was gastrointestinal disturbance ; dose - dependent decreases in mean body weight , body weight gain , and food consumption were observed .
During the post - dose phase , the effect was reversed .
In a dose range - finding study , there was a 17 % decrease in the pregnancy rate for animals administered 4 mg / kg / day .
A dose - dependent increase in post - implantation loss was observed .
Two dams administered 4 mg / kg / day had litters with no viable fetuses ; the mean fetal weight was slightly decreased in animals administered 4 mg / kg / day .
In the definitive study , mean fetal weights were significantly decreased in animals administered 0 . 5 to 3 mg / kg / day of treprostinil diolamine .
At doses of 1 . 5 and 3 mg / kg / day , external fetal and soft tissue malformations were observed in a few fetuses , and the total fetal skeletal malformations were significantly increased .
The no observed adverse effect level was less than 0 . 5 mg / kg / day ( maternal ) , 1 . 5 mg / kg / day ( fetal viability and growth ) , and 0 . 5 mg / kg / day ( teratogenicity ) .
The 0 . 5 mg / kg / day dose represents about 3 times the human exposure at the dose of 3 . 5 mg BID on an AUC basis .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of treprostinil in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Use of Orenitram in patients aged 65 years and over demonstrated slightly higher absolute and relative adverse event rates compared to younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment There is a marked increase in the systemic exposure to treprostinil in hepatically impaired patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Contraindications ( 4 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Patients with Renal Impairment No dose adjustments are required in patients with renal impairment .
Orenitram is not removed by dialysis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Signs and symptoms of overdose with Orenitram during clinical trials reflect its dose - limiting pharmacologic effects and include severe headache , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and hypotension .
Treat supportively .
11 DESCRIPTION Orenitram is an extended - release osmotic tablet for oral administration .
Orenitram is formulated as the diolamine salt of treprostinil , a tricyclic benzindene analogue of prostacyclin .
The chemical name is Acetic acid , 2 - [ [ ( 1 R , 2 R , 3 aS , 9 aS ) - 2 , 3 , 3 a , 4 , 9 , 9 a - hexahydro - 2 - hydroxy - 1 - [ ( 3 S ) - 3 - hydroxyoctyl ] - 1 H - benz [ f ] inden - 5 - yl ] oxy ] - , complexed with 2 , 2 ' - iminobis [ ethanol ] ( 1 : 1 ) .
The molecular formula is C23H34O5 . C4H11NO2 , the molecular weight is 495 . 65 , and it has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Orenitram tablets are formulated in five strengths , which contain 0 . 125 mg of treprostinil ( equivalent to 0 . 159 mg treprostinil diolamine ) , 0 . 25 mg of treprostinil ( equivalent to 0 . 317 mg treprostinil diolamine ) , 1 mg of treprostinil ( equivalent to 1 . 27 mg treprostinil diolamine ) , 2 . 5 mg of treprostinil ( equivalent to 3 . 17 mg treprostinil diolamine ) , or 5 mg of treprostinil ( equivalent to 6 . 35 mg treprostinil diolamine ) .
The formulations also contain xylitol , maltodextrin , sodium lauryl sulfate , magnesium stearate , cellulose acetate , triethyl citrate , polyvinyl alcohol , titanium dioxide , polyethylene glycol , and talc .
In addition , tablets may contain colorants FD & C Blue # 2 , iron oxide yellow , and iron oxide red .
The imprint ink contains shellac glaze , ethanol , isopropyl alcohol USP , iron oxide black , n - butyl alcohol , and propylene glycol .
Orenitram is designed to release treprostinil at a near zero - order rate using an osmotic tablet technology .
The tablet core is coated with a semi - permeable membrane and has a laser - drilled aperture through the membrane .
Upon contact with water ( e . g . , after ingestion ) , the core tablet absorbs water through the semi - permeable membrane .
The water dissolves the water - soluble treprostinil diolamine and the water - soluble osmotic excipients , which creates hydrostatic pressure within the membrane , eventually forcing the drug across the membrane at a controlled rate .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The major pharmacologic actions of treprostinil are direct vasodilation of pulmonary and systemic arterial vascular beds , inhibition of platelet aggregation , and inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In a clinical trial of 240 healthy adult volunteers , single doses of inhaled treprostinil 54 µg ( the target clinical dose ) and 84 µg ( supratherapeutic inhalation dose ) prolonged the corrected QTc interval by approximately 10 msec .
The QTc effect dissipated rapidly as the concentration of treprostinil decreased .
Orenitram has not been evaluated in a thorough QTc study .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In patients with PAH , pharmacokinetics of treprostinil is dose - proportional for systemic exposure ( AUC0 - t ) over the dose range from 0 . 5 to 15 mg BID .
Upon repeat administration with a BID regimen , the accumulation in the systemic exposures to treprostinil is minimal and results in a peak - to - trough ratio of approximately 7 .
However , a TID regimen will reduce the peak - to - trough fluctuations to approximately 2 . 5 for the same total daily dose .
Absorption The absolute oral bioavailability of Orenitram is approximately 17 % .
Maximum treprostinil concentrations occur between approximately 4 and 6 hours following Orenitram administration .
Time to reach steady - state concentrations for both BID and TID regimens is approximately 1 to 2 days .
The absorption of Orenitram is affected by food .
The AUCinf of treprostinil was increased by 49 % and the Cmax was increased by an average of 13 % when Orenitram was administered following a high - fat , high - calorie meal compared to fasting conditions in healthy volunteers .
The relative bioavailability of treprostinil following oral administration of Orenitram 1 mg is not significantly altered by meal types ranging from 250 to 500 calories in healthy volunteers .
When Orenitram 1 mg was administered with alcohol at 0 . 5 mg / kg or the equivalent of 3 servings ( at the same time , or ± 1 hour relative to alcohol consumption ) , there was no significant change ( 10 % to 20 % increase ) in the exposure to treprostinil compared to Orenitram administered alone .
Distribution The treprostinil component of Orenitram is highly bound to human plasma proteins , approximately 96 % over a treprostinil concentration range of 0 . 01 to 10 µg / mL .
Metabolism and Excretion In a study conducted in healthy volunteers using [ 14 C ] treprostinil , treprostinil was extensively metabolized on the side chain of the molecule via oxidation , oxidative cleavage , dehydration , and glucuronic acid conjugation .
Treprostinil is primarily metabolized by CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C9 .
No new major metabolites are found upon oral administration compared to parenteral administration of treprostinil .
Only 1 . 13 % and 0 . 19 % is excreted as unchanged parent drug in the feces and urine , respectively .
Based on in vitro studies , treprostinil does not inhibit or induce major CYP enzymes [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment : In subjects with mild ( n = 8 ) hepatic impairment , administration of a single 1 mg dose of Orenitram resulted in a mean Cmax and an AUC0 - inf that were 1 . 6 - and 2 . 1 - fold values seen in healthy subjects , respectively .
With moderate impairment ( n = 8 ) , the corresponding ratios were 4 . 0 - and 4 . 8 - fold , and with severe impairment ( n = 6 ) , they were 4 . 8 - and 7 . 6 - fold [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Contraindications ( 4 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Renal Impairment : In patients with severe renal impairment requiring dialysis ( n = 8 ) , administration of a single 1 mg dose of Orenitram pre - and post - dialysis resulted in an AUC0 - inf that was not significantly altered compared to healthy subjects .
Drug Interactions Results of drug interaction studies are shown in Figure 1 .
Only for the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor does the interaction affect dosing [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Figure 1 : Impact of Co - Administered Drugs on the Systemic Exposure of Treprostinil 1 mg Compared to Orenitram Administered Alone [ MULTIMEDIA ] Warfarin : A drug interaction study was carried out with Remodulin co - administered with warfarin ( 25 mg / day ) in healthy volunteers .
There was no clinically significant effect of either medication on the pharmacokinetics of treprostinil .
Additionally , treprostinil did not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin .
The pharmacokinetics of R - and S - warfarin and the international normalized ratio ( INR ) in healthy subjects given a single 25 mg dose of warfarin were unaffected by continuous subcutaneous infusion of treprostinil at an infusion rate of 10 ng / kg / min .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Treprostinil diolamine did not demonstrate any carcinogenic effects in mouse or rat carcinogenicity studies .
Oral administration of treprostinil diolamine to Tg . rasH2 mice at 0 , 5 , 10 , and 20 mg / kg / day in males and 0 , 3 , 7 . 5 , and 15 mg / kg / day in females daily for 26 weeks did not significantly increase the incidence of tumors .
Oral administration of treprostinil diolamine to Sprague Dawley rats at 0 , 1 , 3 , and 10 mg / kg / day daily for 104 weeks did not significantly increase the incidence of tumors .
The exposures obtained at the highest dose levels used in males and females are about 13 - and 18 - fold , respectively , the human exposure at the dose of 3 . 5 mg BID on an AUC basis .
In vitro genotoxicity studies with high doses of treprostinil did not demonstrate any mutagenic or clastogenic effects .
Treprostinil diolamine was tested in vivo in a rat micronucleus assay and did not induce an increased incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes .
In rats , treatment with treprostinil diolamine had no effect on reproductive performance or sperm motility at doses up to 10 mg / kg / day .
The exposures at this dose level are about 6 - ( male ) to 11 - ( female ) fold the human exposure at the dose of 3 . 5 mg BID on an AUC basis .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Clinical Trials in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Four multicenter , randomized , double - blind studies were conducted and compared Orenitram to placebo in a total of 349 ( Study 1 ) , 350 ( Study 2 ) , 310 ( Study 3 ) , and 690 ( Study 4 ) patients with PAH .
Study 1 ( effect seen with no background vasodilator ) Study 1 was a 12 - week , randomized ( 2 : 1 Orenitram to placebo ) , double - blind , placebo - controlled , international efficacy and safety study of Orenitram in patients with WHO Group 1 PAH not currently receiving PAH therapy .
The primary efficacy endpoint was placebo - corrected change in six - minute walk distance ( 6 MWD ) from Baseline to Week 12 .
Study drug dose was titrated to a maximum of 12 mg BID based on clinical response and study drug tolerability .
Study 1 enrolled 349 patients ( overall analysis population ) who were not receiving any PAH medication .
At the beginning of the study , subjects were dosed with only the 1 mg tablets with 0 . 5 and 0 . 25 mg tablets introduced at sequentially later dates during the study .
The primary analysis population consisted of the 228 patients who had access to the 0 . 25 mg tablet at the time of randomization .
Patients were administered Orenitram or placebo twice daily , with the doses titrated to effect over the course of the 12 - week trial .
Patients were in WHO functional class II ( ~ 33 % ) and class III ( ~ 66 % ) with either idiopathic or heritable PAH ( ~ 75 % ) , collagen vascular disease associated PAH ( ~ 19 % ) , or PAH associated with HIV ( 1 % ) or congenital heart defect ( 5 % ) or other conditions ( ~ 6 % ) .
The patients ' mean baseline 6 MWD was approximately 330 meters .
In the primary analysis population , 17 % of patients discontinued Orenitram compared to 14 % of patients on placebo .
The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial was the change in 6 MWD at 12 weeks for the primary analysis population .
Analysis of Study 1 results demonstrated that those patients receiving Orenitram compared to patients receiving placebo improved their median change in 6 MWD by approximately 23 meters ( p = 0 . 013 ) as compared to patients receiving placebo as demonstrated in ( Figure 2 ) .
The within group median change from baseline was + 25 meters for Orenitram and - 5 meters for placebo at Week 12 ( N = 228 ) .
Mean dose ( ± SD ) in the Orenitram group was 2 . 3 ± 1 . 3 , 3 . 2 ± 1 . 9 , and 3 . 4 ± 1 . 9 mg BID at Weeks 4 , 8 , and 12 , respectively , with a maximum dose of 12 mg BID .
The distribution of the 6 MWD change from baseline at Week 12 was also plotted across the range of observed values ( Figure 3 ) .
Figure 2 : Estimate of Treatment Effect by Visit for the Primary Analysis Population ( Study 1 ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 3 : Plot of the Distribution of Peak 6 MWD Changes at Week 12 for the Primary Analysis Population ( Study 1 ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] The placebo - corrected median treatment effect on 6 MWD was estimated within various subpopulations defined by age , gender , disease etiology , and baseline 6 MWD ( Figure 4 ) .
Figure 4 : Placebo Corrected Median Treatment Effect ( with 95 % CI ) on 6 MWD Change from Baseline at Week 12 for Various Subgroups in the Primary Analysis Population ( Study 1 ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Studies 2 and 3 ( no effect on a background of ERA , PDE - 5 inhibitor , or both ) Studies 2 ( N = 350 ) and 3 ( N = 310 ) were 16 - week , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , international efficacy and safety studies of Orenitram in patients with WHO Group 1 PAH .
The primary efficacy endpoint was placebo - corrected change in 6 MWD from Baseline to Week 16 .
Patients were in WHO functional class II ( ~ 23 % ) and class III ( ~ 77 % ) with either idiopathic or heritable PAH ( ~ 66 % ) , collagen vascular disease associated PAH ( ~ 29 % ) , or PAH associated with HIV ( 1 % ) or congenital heart defect ( 4 % ) .
The patients ' mean baseline 6 MWD was approximately 340 meters .
Approximately 40 % were receiving both an ERA and a PDE - 5 inhibitor .
The results did not demonstrate a benefit in exercise testing with median 6 MWD at Week 16 .
Study 4 ( effect seen with a single background PAH therapy ) The effect of Orenitram on the progression of PAH was demonstrated in an international , multicenter , double - blind , event - driven study in patients with WHO Group 1 PAH randomized 1 : 1 to Orenitram or placebo ( Study 4 ) .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to first clinical worsening ( morbidity or mortality ) event .
Study drug dose was titrated starting at 0 . 125 mg TID to a maximum of 12 mg TID based on clinical response and study drug tolerability .
Study 4 enrolled a total of 690 patients ( primary efficacy analysis population ) who were currently receiving a single approved PAH therapy ( PDE - 5 inhibitor or soluble guanylate cyclase ( sGC ) [ 72 % ] ; ERA [ 28 % ] ) .
The median age was 43 years and most patients were white ( 52 % ) and female ( 79 % ) .
The majority of patients were lower risk in WHO functional class II ( 63 % ) with a mean ( ± SD ) baseline 6 MWD of 396 ( ± 96 ) meters .
Most patients had either idiopathic or heritable PAH ( 63 % ) or collagen vascular disease associated PAH ( 26 % ) .
Patients treated with Orenitram achieved a median dose of 3 . 6 mg TID at Week 24 , which continued to increase until approximately Week 60 where the median dose of Orenitram was approximately 5 mg TID .
Treatment with Orenitram resulted in a significant increase in the time to first clinical worsening event compared with patients who received placebo , which was associated with a reduction in the risk of an event ( HR = 0 . 75 [ 95 % CI ; 0 . 57 , 0 . 99 ] ; p = 0 . 039 ; Figure 5 ) .
The beneficial effect of Orenitram was primarily attributable to a delay in disease progression — defined as a 15 % decline in 6 MWD plus an increase in either WHO Functional Class or worsening of signs or symptoms of right heart failure — ( HR = 0 . 39 [ 95 % CI ; 0 . 23 , 0 . 66 ] ; Figure 6 ) , but there was no effect on the other components of clinical worsening ( Table 2 ) .

Figure 7 : Forest Plot of Subgroup Analyses of Time to Disease Progression for Various Subgroups in the Primary Analysis Population ( Study 4 ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Long - Term Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Patients ( N = 824 ) from the placebo - controlled studies entered a long - term , uncontrolled , open - label extension study .
The average exposure to Orenitram was approximately 2 years with a maximum exposure of approximately 6 years .
The dose of Orenitram continued to increase over time with doses ( mean ± SD ) of 3 . 6 ± 2 . 7 , 4 . 2 ± 3 . 1 , and 5 ± 3 . 7 mg BID at 6 ( n = 649 ) , 12 ( n = 433 ) , and 24 months ( n = 238 ) , respectively , with a maximum dose of 21 mg BID .
Reasons for discontinuation from the study included adverse event ( 16 % ) , progression of disease ( 15 % ) , death ( 13 % ) , and withdrawn consent ( 7 % ) .
In the 522 subjects that completed the 12 - month efficacy assessment , their mean 6 MWD improved by 24 meters compared to baseline ( 30 meters in monotherapy patients and 20 meters when Orenitram was used in combination with an ERA and / or a PDE - 5 inhibitor ) .
Of the patients that remained in the study , overall survival was 92 % , 87 % , and 82 % at the end of 1 , 2 , and 3 years , respectively , with progression - free survival ( progression defined as death , discontinuation , or addition of a PAH therapy ) of 74 % , 61 % , and 47 % .
Without a control group , these data must be interpreted cautiously .
Remodulin to Orenitram Transition Study A 24 - week , multicenter , open - label study enrolled 33 WHO Group 1 patients on stable doses of Remodulin .
All patients received background therapy with a PDE - 5 inhibitor and / or ERA .
Patients were WHO functional class I or II and hemodynamically stable at baseline with a cardiac index > 2 . 2 L / m2 , RAP < 11 mmHg , and PVR < 10 Wood units .
The primary endpoint of the study was the safety and tolerability of the transition .
Successful transition was defined as transition from Remodulin to Orenitram at Week 4 ( no longer receiving Remodulin ) and clinically maintained on Orenitram through Week 24 ( as measured by 6 MWD and hemodynamics ) .
All patients transitioned from Remodulin to Orenitram ( median time to transition of 3 days ) with thirty - one patients ( 94 % ) completing transition in 5 days ( range 2 to 29 days ) .
Two subjects discontinued Orenitram .
After 24 weeks of treatment with Orenitram , 6 MWD and hemodynamics remained stable .
Without a control group , these data must be interpreted cautiously .
