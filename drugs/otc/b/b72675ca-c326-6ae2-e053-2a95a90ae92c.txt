Following oral administration of econazole nitrate to lactating rats , econazole and / or metabolites were excreted in milk and were found in nursing pups .
Also , in lactating rats receiving large oral doses ( 40 or 80 times the human dermal dose ) , there was a reduction in post partum viability of pups and survival to weaning ; however , at these high doses , maternal toxicity was present and may have been a contributing factor .
Caution should be exercised when econazole nitrate is administered to a nursing woman .
