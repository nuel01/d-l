CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY METHENAMINE degrades in an acidic urine environment releasing formaldehyde which provides bactericidal or bacteriostatic action .
It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract .
70 to 90 % reaches the urine unchanged at which point it is hydrolyzed if the urine is acidic .
Within 24 hours it is almost completely ( 90 % ) excreted ; of this amount at pH 5 , approximately 20 % is formaldehyde .
Protein binding - some formaldehyde is bound to substances in the urine and surrounding tissues .
Methenamine is freely distributed to body tissue and fluids but is not clinically significant as it does not hydrolyze at a pH greater than 6 . 8 .
SODIUM PHOSPHATE MONOBASIC an acidifier , helps to maintain an acid pH in the urine necessary for the degradation of methenamine .
PHENYL SALICYLATE releases salicylate , a mild analgesic for pain .
METHYLENE BLUE possesses weak antiseptic properties .
It is well absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and is rapidly reduced to leukomethylene blue which is stabilized in some combination form in the urine .
75 % is excreted unchanged .
HYOSCYAMINE SULFATE is a parasympatholytic drug which relaxes smooth muscles and thus produces an antispasmodic effect .
It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is rapidly distributed throughout the body tissues .
Most is excreted in the urine within 12 hours , 13 % to 50 % being unchanged .
Protein binding for hyoscyamine sulfate is moderate and biotransformation is hepatic .

DRUG INTERACTIONS As a result of hyoscyamine ' s effects on gastrointestinal motility and gastric emptying , absorption of other oral medications may be decreased during concurrent use with this combination medication .
Urinary alkalizers and thiazide diuretics May cause the urine to become alkaline reducing the effectiveness of methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde .
Antimuscarinics Concurrent use may intensify antimuscarinic effects of hyoscyamine because of secondary antimuscarinic activities of these medications .
Antacids / antidiarrheals Concurrent use may reduce absorption of hyoscyamine resulting in decreased therapeutic effectiveness .
Concurrent use with antacids may cause urine to become alkaline reducing the effectiveness of methenamine by inhibiting its conversion to formaldehyde .
Doses of these medications should be spaced 1 hour apart from doses of hyoscyamine .
Antimyasthenics Concurrent use with hyoscyamine may further reduce intestinal motility , therefore , caution is recommended .
Ketoconazole and hyoscyamine may cause increased gastrointestinal pH . Concurrent administration with hyoscyamine may result in marked reduction in the absorption of ketoconazole .
Patients should be advised to take this combination at least 2 hours after ketoconazole .
Monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitors Concurrent use with hyoscyamine may intensify antimuscarinic side effects .
Opioid ( narcotic ) analgesics may result in increased risk of severe constipation .
Sulfonamides These drugs may precipitate with formaldehyde in the urine increasing the danger of crystalluria .
Patients should be advised that the urine and / or stools may become blue to blue - green as a result of the excretion of methylene blue .
Drug Abuse And Dependence A dependence on the use of Uro - SP Capsules has not been reported and due to the nature of its ingredients , abuse of Uro - SP Capsules is not expected .
OVERDOSAGE Emesis or gastric lavage .
Slow intravenous administration of physostigmine in doses of 1 to 4 mg ( 0 . 5 to 1 mg in children ) repeated as needed in one to two hours to reverse severe antimuscarinic symptoms .
