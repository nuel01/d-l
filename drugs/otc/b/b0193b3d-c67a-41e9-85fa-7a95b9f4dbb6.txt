1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE LANTUS is indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
LANTUS is a long - acting human insulin analog indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
( 1 ) Limitations of Use • Not recommended for treating diabetic ketoacidosis .
( 1 ) Limitations of Use LANTUS is not recommended for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Individualize dosage based on metabolic needs , blood glucose monitoring , glycemic control , type of diabetes , and prior insulin use .
( 2 . 1 , 2 . 3 , 2 . 4 ) • Administer subcutaneously into the abdominal area , thigh , or deltoid once daily at any time of day , but at the same time every day .
( 2 . 1 ) • Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution .
( 2 . 1 ) • Rotate injection sites to reduce risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis .
( 2 . 2 ) • Closely monitor glucose when changing to LANTUS and during initial weeks thereafter .
( 2 . 4 ) 2 . 1 Important Administration Instructions • Administer LANTUS subcutaneously once daily at any time of day but at the same time every day .
• Prior to initiation of LANTUS , train patients on proper use and injection technique .
• Patient should follow the Instructions for Use to correctly administer LANTUS .
• Administer LANTUS subcutaneously into the abdominal area , thigh , or deltoid , and rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis .
Do not inject into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
• During changes to a patient ' s insulin regimen , increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
• Visually inspect LANTUS vials and SoloStar prefilled pens for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration .
Only use if the solution is clear and colorless with no visible particles .
• The LANTUS SoloStar prefilled pen dials in 1 - unit increments .
• Use LANTUS SoloStar prefilled pen with caution in patients with visual impairment who may rely on audible clicks to dial their dose .
• Refrigerate unused ( unopened ) LANTUS vials and SoloStar ® prefilled pens .
• Do not administer intravenously or via an insulin pump .
• Do not dilute or mix LANTUS with any other insulin or solution .
• The SoloStar prefilled pen is for single patient use only [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 2 General Dosing Instructions • Individualize and adjust the dosage of LANTUS based on the individual ' s metabolic needs , blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal .
• Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity , changes in meal patterns ( i . e . , macronutrient content or timing of food intake ) , during acute illness , or changes in renal or hepatic function .
Dosage adjustments should only be made under medical supervision with appropriate glucose monitoring [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
2 . 3 Initiation of LANTUS Therapy Type 1 Diabetes • In patients with type 1 diabetes , LANTUS must be used concomitantly with short - acting insulin .
The recommended starting dose of LANTUS in patients with type 1 diabetes should be approximately one - third of the total daily insulin requirements .
Short - acting , premeal insulin should be used to satisfy the remainder of the daily insulin requirements .
Type 2 Diabetes • The recommended starting dose of LANTUS in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not currently treated with insulin is 0 . 2 units / kg or up to 10 units once daily .
One may need to adjust the amount and timing of short - or rapid - acting insulins and dosages of any oral antidiabetic drugs .
2 . 4 Changing to LANTUS from Other Insulin Therapies • If changing patients from once - daily TOUJEO ( insulin glargine ) 300 units / mL to once - daily LANTUS , the recommended initial LANTUS dose is 80 % of the TOUJEO dose that is being discontinued .
This dose reduction will lower the likelihood of hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
• If changing from a treatment regimen with an intermediate or long - acting insulin to a regimen with LANTUS , a change in the dose of the basal insulin may be required and the amount and timing of the shorter - acting insulins and doses of any oral antidiabetic drugs may need to be adjusted .
• If changing patients from once - daily NPH insulin to once - daily LANTUS , the recommended initial LANTUS dose is the same as the dose of NPH that is being discontinued .
• If changing patients from twice - daily NPH insulin to once - daily LANTUS , the recommended initial LANTUS dosage is 80 % of the total NPH dose that is being discontinued .
This dosage reduction will lower the likelihood of hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Injection : 100 units per mL ( U - 100 ) available as : • 10 mL multiple - dose vial ( 1 , 000 units / 10 mL ) • 3 mL single - patient - use SoloStar prefilled pen ( 300 units / 3 mL ) Injection : 100 units / mL ( U - 100 ) available as : • 10 mL multiple - dose vial ( 3 ) • 3 mL single - patient - use SoloStar prefilled pen ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS LANTUS is contraindicated : • during episodes of hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • in patients with hypersensitivity to LANTUS or one of its excipients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • During episodes of hypoglycemia ( 4 ) • Hypersensitivity to LANTUS or one of its excipients ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Never share a LANTUS SoloStar prefilled pen between patients , even if the needle is changed .
( 5 . 1 ) • Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen : Make changes to a patient ' s insulin regimen ( e . g . , insulin strength , manufacturer , type , injection site or method of administration ) under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring .
( 5 . 2 ) • Hypoglycemia : May be life - threatening .
Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to : insulin dosage , coadministered glucose lowering medications , meal pattern , physical activity ; and in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and hypoglycemia unawareness .
( 5 . 3 , 6 . 1 ) • Medication Errors : Accidental mix - ups between insulin products can occur .
Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection .
( 5 . 4 , 6 . 3 ) • Hypersensitivity reactions : Severe , life - threatening , generalized allergy , including anaphylaxis , can occur .
Discontinue LANTUS .
Monitor and treat if indicated .
( 5 . 5 , 6 . 1 ) • Hypokalemia : May be life - threatening .
Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated .
( 5 . 6 ) • Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) : Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure ; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of TZD if heart failure occurs .
( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Never Share a LANTUS SoloStar Prefilled Pen , Syringe , or Needle Between Patients LANTUS SoloStar prefilled pens must never be shared between patients , even if the needle is changed .
Patients using LANTUS vials must never re - use or share needles or syringes with another person .
Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood - borne pathogens .
5 . 2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in an insulin regimen ( e . g . , insulin strength , manufacturer , type , injection site or method of administration ) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] or hyperglycemia .
Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia ; and a sudden change in the injection site ( to unaffected area ) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Make any changes to a patient ' s insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring .
Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia .
For patients with type 2 diabetes , dosage adjustments of concomitant oral and antidiabetic products may be needed .
5 . 3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulin , including LANTUS .
Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures , may be life - threatening or cause death .
Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time ; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important ( e . g . , driving or operating other machinery ) .
Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual .
Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes , in patients with diabetic nerve disease , in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system ( e . g . , beta - blockers ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia .
Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and , in general , is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal .
As with all insulin preparations , the glucose lowering effect time course of LANTUS may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions , including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern ( e . g . , macronutrient content or timing of meals ) , changes in level of physical activity , or changes to coadministered medication [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 , 8 . 7 ) ] .
Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia .
Self - monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia .
In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia , increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended .
The long - acting effect of LANTUS may delay recovery from hypoglycemia .
5 . 4 Medication Errors Accidental mix - ups among insulin products , particularly between long - acting insulins and rapid - acting insulins , have been reported .
To avoid medication errors between LANTUS and other insulins , instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 5 Hypersensitivity and Allergic Reactions Severe , life - threatening , generalized allergy , including anaphylaxis , can occur with insulin products , including LANTUS .
If hypersensitivity reactions occur , discontinue LANTUS ; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
LANTUS is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin glargine or one of the excipients [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
5 . 6 Hypokalemia All insulin products , including LANTUS , cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space , possibly leading to hypokalemia .
Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis , ventricular arrhythmia , and death .
Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia , if indicated ( e . g . , patients using potassium - lowering medications , patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations ) .
5 . 7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR - gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) , which are peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor ( PPAR ) - gamma agonists , can cause dose - related fluid retention , particularly when used in combination with insulin .
Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure .
Patients treated with insulin , including LANTUS , and a PPAR - gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure .
If heart failure develops , it should be managed according to current standards of care , and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR - gamma agonist must be considered .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere : • Hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Hypokalemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] Adverse reactions commonly associated with LANTUS include hypoglycemia , allergic reactions , injection site reactions , lipodystrophy , pruritus , rash , edema , and weight gain .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 2327 patients with type 1 diabetes to LANTUS or NPH .
The type 1 diabetes population had the following characteristics : Mean age was 38 . 5 years .
Fifty - four percent were male , 96 . 9 % were Caucasian , 1 . 8 % were Black or African American and 2 . 7 % were Hispanic .
The mean BMI was 25 . 1 kg / m2 .
The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 1563 patients with type 2 diabetes to LANTUS or NPH .
The type 2 diabetes population had the following characteristics : Mean age was 59 . 3 years .
Fifty - eight percent were male , 86 . 7 % were Caucasian , 7 . 8 % were Black or African American and 9 % were Hispanic .
The mean BMI was 29 . 2 kg / m2 .
The frequencies of adverse events during LANTUS clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below .

Tables 5 , 6 , and 7 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the LANTUS individual clinical trials .
Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg / dL ( ≤ 56 mg / dL in the 5 - year trial and ≤ 36 mg / dL in the ORIGIN trial ) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate , intravenous glucose , or glucagon administration .
Percentages of LANTUS - treated adult patients experiencing severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the LANTUS clinical trials [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] were comparable to percentages of NPH - treated patients for all treatment regimens ( see Tables 5 and 6 ) .
In the pediatric phase 3 clinical trial , children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to the adult trials with type 1 diabetes .

Table 7 : Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in the ORIGIN Trial ORIGIN Trial Median duration of follow - up : 6 . 2 years LANTUS N = 6231 Standard Care N = 6273 Percent of patients 5 . 6 1 . 8 Peripheral Edema Some patients taking LANTUS have experienced sodium retention and edema , particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy .
Lipodystrophy Administration of insulin subcutaneously , including LANTUS , has resulted in lipoatrophy ( depression in the skin ) or lipohypertrophy ( enlargement or thickening of tissue ) in some patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Insulin Initiation and Intensification of Glucose Control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory , reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder , worsening of diabetic retinopathy , and acute painful peripheral neuropathy .
However , long - term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy .
Weight Gain Weight gain has occurred with some insulin therapies including LANTUS and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria .
Allergic Reactions Local allergy As with any insulin therapy , patients taking LANTUS may experience injection site reactions , including redness , pain , itching , urticaria , edema , and inflammation .
In clinical studies in adult patients , there was a higher incidence of treatment - emergent injection site pain in LANTUS - treated patients ( 2 . 7 % ) compared to NPH insulin - treated patients ( 0 . 7 % ) .
The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy .
Systemic allergy Severe , life - threatening , generalized allergy , including anaphylaxis , generalized skin reactions , angioedema , bronchospasm , hypotension , and shock may occur with any insulin , including LANTUS and may be life threatening .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is potential for immunogenicity .
All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies .
The presence of such insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose .
In phase 3 clinical trials of LANTUS , increases in titers of antibodies to insulin were observed in NPH insulin and LANTUS treatment groups with similar incidences .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of LANTUS .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins , particularly rapid - acting insulins , have been accidentally administered instead of LANTUS [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
To avoid medication errors between LANTUS and other insulins , patients should be instructed to always verify the insulin label before each injection .
Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred .
Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis ; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site .

( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published studies with use of insulin glargine during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with insulin glargine and adverse developmental outcomes [ see Data ] .
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
Rats and rabbits were exposed to insulin glargine in animal reproduction studies during organogenesis , respectively 50 times and 10 times the human subcutaneous dose of 0 . 2 units / kg / day .
Overall , the effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin [ see Data ] .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 % to 10 % in women with pregestational diabetes with an HbA1c > 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 % to 25 % in women with a HbA1c > 10 .
The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo - fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis , preeclampsia , spontaneous abortions , preterm delivery , and delivery complications .
Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects , stillbirth , and macrosomia - related morbidity .
Data Human data Published data do not report a clear association with insulin glargine and major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when insulin glargine is used during pregnancy .
However , these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations including small sample size and some lacking comparator groups .
Animal data Subcutaneous reproduction and teratology studies have been performed with insulin glargine and regular human insulin in rats and Himalayan rabbits .
Insulin glargine was given to female rats before mating , during mating , and throughout pregnancy at doses up to 0 . 36 mg / kg / day , which is approximately 50 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dose of 0 . 2 units / kg / day ( 0 . 007 mg / kg / day ) , on a mg / kg basis .
In rabbits , doses of 0 . 072 mg / kg / day , which is approximately 10 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dose of 0 . 2 units / kg / day on a mg / kg basis , were administered during organogenesis .
The effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin in rats or rabbits .
However , in rabbits , five fetuses from two litters of the high - dose group exhibited dilation of the cerebral ventricles .
Fertility and early embryonic development appeared normal .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are either no or only limited data on the presence of insulin glargine in human milk , the effects on breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Endogenous insulin is present in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for LANTUS , and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from LANTUS or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of LANTUS have been established in pediatric patients ( age 6 to 15 years ) with type 1 diabetes [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of LANTUS in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age with type 1 diabetes and pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes have not been established .
The dosage recommendation when changing to LANTUS in pediatric patients ( age 6 to 15 years ) with type 1 diabetes is the same as that described for adults [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 4 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
As in adults , the dosage of LANTUS must be individualized in pediatric patients ( age 6 to 15 years ) with type 1 diabetes based on metabolic needs and frequent monitoring of blood glucose .
In the pediatric clinical trial , pediatric patients ( age 6 to 15 years ) with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia compared to the adults in trials with type 1 diabetes [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in controlled clinical studies of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who were treated with LANTUS , 15 % were ≥ 65 years of age and 2 % were ≥ 75 years of age .
The only difference in safety or effectiveness in the subpopulation of patients ≥ 65 years of age compared to the entire study population was a higher incidence of cardiovascular events typically seen in an older population in the LANTUS and NPH treatment groups .
Nevertheless , caution should be exercised when LANTUS is administered to geriatric patients .
In elderly patients with diabetes , the initial dosing , dose increments , and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions .
Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of LANTUS has not been studied .
Frequent glucose monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary for LANTUS in patients with hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of LANTUS has not been studied .
Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with renal failure .
Frequent glucose monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary for LANTUS in patients with renal impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 8 Obesity In controlled clinical trials , subgroup analyses based on BMI did not show differences in safety and efficacy between LANTUS and NPH .
10 OVERDOSAGE Excess insulin administration may cause hypoglycemia and hypokalemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 , 5 . 6 ) ] .
Mild episodes of hypoglycemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates .
Adjustments in drug dosage , meal patterns , or exercise may be needed .
More severe episodes of hypoglycemia with coma , seizure , or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular / subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose .
After apparent clinical recovery from hypoglycemia , continued observation and additional carbohydrate intake may be necessary to avoid recurrence of hypoglycemia .
Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately .
11 DESCRIPTION LANTUS ( insulin glargine injection ) is a sterile solution of insulin glargine for subcutaneous use .
Insulin glargine is a recombinant human insulin analog that is a long - acting , parenteral blood - glucose - lowering agent [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ] .
Insulin glargine has low aqueous solubility at neutral pH . At pH 4 insulin glargine is completely soluble .
After injection into the subcutaneous tissue , the acidic solution is neutralized , leading to formation of microprecipitates from which small amounts of insulin glargine are slowly released , resulting in a relatively constant concentration / time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak .
This profile allows once - daily dosing as a basal insulin .
LANTUS is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non - pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli ( K12 ) as the production organism .
Insulin glargine differs from human insulin in that the amino acid asparagine at position A21 is replaced by glycine and two arginines are added to the C - terminus of the B - chain .
Chemically , insulin glargine is 21 A - Gly - 30 Ba - L - Arg - 30 Bb - L - Arg - human insulin and has the empirical formula C267H404N72O78S6 and a molecular weight of 6063 .
Insulin glargine has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] LANTUS consists of insulin glargine dissolved in a clear aqueous fluid .
Each milliliter of LANTUS ( insulin glargine injection ) contains 100 units ( 3 . 6378 mg ) insulin glargine .
The 10 mL vial presentation contains the following inactive ingredients per mL : 30 mcg zinc , 2 . 7 mg m - cresol , 20 mg glycerol 85 % , 20 mcg polysorbate 20 , and water for injection .
The 3 mL prefilled pen presentation contains the following inactive ingredients per mL : 30 mcg zinc , 2 . 7 mg m - cresol , 20 mg glycerol 85 % , and water for injection .
The pH is adjusted by addition of aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide .
LANTUS has a pH of approximately 4 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of insulin , including insulin glargine , is regulation of glucose metabolism .
Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake , especially by skeletal muscle and fat , and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production .
Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis , and enhances protein synthesis .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In clinical studies , the glucose - lowering effect on a molar basis ( i . e . , when given at the same doses ) of intravenous insulin glargine is approximately the same as that for human insulin .
Figure 1 shows results from a study in patients with type 1 diabetes conducted for a maximum of 24 hours after the injection .
The median time between injection and the end of pharmacological effect was 14 . 5 hours ( range : 9 . 5 to 19 . 3 hours ) for NPH insulin , and 24 hours ( range : 10 . 8 to > 24 . 0 hours ) ( 24 hours was the end of the observation period ) for insulin glargine .
* Determined as amount of glucose infused to maintain constant plasma glucose levels Figure 1 : Activity Profile in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes [ MULTIMEDIA ] The duration of action after abdominal , deltoid , or thigh subcutaneous administration was similar .
The time course of action of insulins , including LANTUS , may vary between individuals and within the same individual .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Bioavailability After subcutaneous injection of LANTUS in healthy subjects and in patients with diabetes , the insulin serum concentrations indicated a slower , more prolonged absorption and a relatively constant concentration / time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak in comparison to NPH insulin .
Metabolism and Elimination A metabolism study in humans indicates that insulin glargine is partly metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the B chain in the subcutaneous depot to form two active metabolites with in vitro activity similar to that of human insulin , M1 ( 21 A - Gly - insulin ) and M2 ( 21 A - Gly - des - 30 B - Thr - insulin ) .
Unchanged drug and these degradation products are also present in the circulation .
Special Populations Age , race , and gender Effect of age , race , and gender on the pharmacokinetics of LANTUS has not been evaluated .
However , in controlled clinical trials in adults ( n = 3890 ) and a controlled clinical trial in pediatric patients ( n = 349 ) , subgroup analyses based on age , race , and gender did not show differences in safety and efficacy between LANTUS and NPH insulin [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Obesity Effect of Body Mass Index ( BMI ) on the pharmacokinetics of LANTUS has not been evaluated .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In mice and rats , standard two - year carcinogenicity studies with insulin glargine were performed at doses up to 0 . 455 mg / kg , which was for the rat approximately 65 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dose of 0 . 2 units / kg / day ( 0 . 007 mg / kg / day ) on a mg / kg basis .
Histiocytomas were found at injection sites in male rats and mice in acid vehicle containing groups and are considered a response to chronic tissue irritation and inflammation in rodents .
These tumors were not found in female animals , in saline control , or insulin comparator groups using a different vehicle .
Insulin glargine was not mutagenic in tests for detection of gene mutations in bacteria and mammalian cells ( Ames and HGPRT - test ) and in tests for detection of chromosomal aberrations ( cytogenetics in vitro in V79 cells and in vivo in Chinese hamsters ) .
In a combined fertility and prenatal and postnatal study in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 0 . 36 mg / kg / day , which was approximately 50 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dose of 0 . 2 units / kg / day ( 0 . 007 mg / kg / day ) maternal toxicity due to dose - dependent hypoglycemia , including some deaths , was observed .
Consequently , a reduction of the rearing rate occurred in the high - dose group only .
Similar effects were observed with NPH insulin .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Overview of Clinical Studies The safety and effectiveness of LANTUS given once - daily at bedtime was compared to that of once - daily and twice - daily NPH insulin in open - label , randomized , active - controlled , parallel studies of 2 , 327 adult patients and 349 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 1 , 563 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( see Tables 9 – 11 ) .
In general , the reduction in glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) with LANTUS was similar to that with NPH insulin .
14 . 2 Clinical Studies in Adult and Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes In two clinical studies ( Studies A and B ) , patients with type 1 diabetes ( Study A n = 585 , Study B n = 534 ) were randomized to 28 weeks of basal - bolus treatment with LANTUS or NPH insulin .
Regular human insulin was administered before each meal .
LANTUS was administered at bedtime .
NPH insulin was administered either as once daily at bedtime or in the morning and at bedtime when used twice daily .
In Study A , the average age was 39 . 2 years .
The majority of patients were White ( 99 % ) and 55 . 7 % were male .
The mean BMI was approximately 24 . 9 kg / m2 .
The mean duration of diabetes was 15 . 5 years .
In Study B , the average age was 38 . 5 years .
The majority of patients were White ( 95 . 3 % ) and 50 . 6 % were male .
The mean BMI was approximately 25 . 8 kg / m2 .
The mean duration of diabetes was 17 . 4 years .
In another clinical study ( Study C ) , patients with type 1 diabetes ( n = 619 ) were randomized to 16 weeks of basal - bolus treatment with LANTUS or NPH insulin .
Insulin lispro was used before each meal .
LANTUS was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH insulin was administered once or twice daily .
The average age was 39 . 2 years .
The majority of patients were White ( 96 . 9 % ) and 50 . 6 % were male .
The mean BMI was approximately 25 . 6 kg / m2 .
The mean duration of diabetes was 18 . 5 years .
In these 3 studies , LANTUS and NPH insulin had similar effects on HbA1c ( Table 9 ) with a similar overall rate of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .

LANTUS was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH insulin was administered once or twice daily .
The average age was 11 . 7 years .
The majority of patients were White ( 96 . 8 % ) and 51 . 9 % were male .
The mean BMI was approximately 18 . 9 kg / m2 .
The mean duration of diabetes was 4 . 8 years .
Similar effects on HbA1c ( Table 10 ) were observed in both treatment groups [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .

The average age was 59 . 5 years .
The majority of patients were White ( 92 . 8 % ) and 53 . 7 % were male .
The mean BMI was approximately 29 . 1 kg / m2 .
The mean duration of diabetes was 10 . 3 years .
LANTUS administered once daily at bedtime was as effective as NPH insulin administered once daily at bedtime in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose ( Table 11 ) .
The rate of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was similar in LANTUS and NPH insulin treated patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In a randomized , controlled clinical study ( Study F ) , in patients with type 2 diabetes not using oral antidiabetic medications ( n = 518 ) , a basal - bolus regimen of LANTUS once daily at bedtime or NPH insulin administered once or twice daily was evaluated for 28 weeks .
Regular human insulin was used before meals , as needed .
The average age was 59 . 3 years .
The majority of patients were White ( 80 . 7 % ) and 60 % were male .
The mean BMI was approximately 30 . 5 kg / m2 .
The mean duration of diabetes was 13 . 7 years .
LANTUS had similar effectiveness as either once - or twice - daily NPH insulin in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose ( Table 11 ) with a similar incidence of hypoglycemia [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In a randomized , controlled clinical study ( Study G ) , patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to 5 years of treatment with once - daily LANTUS or twice - daily NPH insulin .
For patients not previously treated with insulin , the starting dose of LANTUS or NPH insulin was 10 units daily .
Patients who were already treated with NPH insulin either continued on the same total daily NPH insulin dose or started LANTUS at a dose that was 80 % of the total previous NPH insulin dose .
The primary endpoint for this study was a comparison of the progression of diabetic retinopathy by 3 or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) scale .
HbA1c change from baseline was a secondary endpoint .
Similar glycemic control in the 2 treatment groups was desired in order to not confound the interpretation of the retinal data .
Patients or study personnel used an algorithm to adjust the LANTUS and NPH insulin doses to a target fasting plasma glucose ≤ 100 mg / dL .
After the LANTUS or NPH insulin dose was adjusted , other antidiabetic agents , including premeal insulin were to be adjusted or added .
The average age was 55 . 1 years .
The majority of patients were White ( 85 . 3 % ) and 53 . 9 % were male .
The mean BMI was approximately 34 . 3 kg / m2 .
The mean duration of diabetes was 10 . 8 years .
The LANTUS group had a smaller mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c compared to the NPH insulin group , which may be explained by the lower daily basal insulin doses in the LANTUS group ( Table 11 ) .
The incidences of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia were similar between groups [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .

LANTUS Timing of Daily Dosing ( see Table 12 ) The safety and efficacy of LANTUS administered pre - breakfast , pre - dinner , or at bedtime were evaluated in a randomized , controlled clinical study in patients with type 1 diabetes ( Study H , n = 378 ) .
Patients were also treated with insulin lispro at mealtime .
The average age was 40 . 9 years .
All patients were White ( 100 % ) and 53 . 7 % were male .
The mean BMI was approximately 25 . 3 kg / m2 .
The mean duration of diabetes was 17 . 3 years .
LANTUS administered at different times of the day resulted in similar reductions in HbA1c compared to that with bedtime administration ( see Table 12 ) .
In these patients , data are available from 8 - point home glucose monitoring .
The maximum mean blood glucose was observed just prior to injection of LANTUS regardless of time of administration .
In this study , 5 % of patients in the LANTUS - breakfast arm discontinued treatment because of lack of efficacy .
No patients in the other two arms discontinued for this reason .
The safety and efficacy of LANTUS administered pre - breakfast or at bedtime were also evaluated in a randomized , active - controlled clinical study ( Study I , n = 697 ) in patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on oral antidiabetic therapy .
All patients in this study also received glimepiride 3 mg daily .
The average age was 60 . 8 years .
The majority of patients were White ( 96 . 6 % ) and 53 . 7 % were male .
The mean BMI was approximately 28 . 7 kg / m2 .
The mean duration of diabetes was 10 . 1 years .
LANTUS given before breakfast was at least as effective in lowering HbA1c as LANTUS given at bedtime or NPH insulin given at bedtime ( see Table 12 ) .

The numbers of retinal adverse events reported for LANTUS and NPH insulin treatment groups were similar for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes .
LANTUS was compared to NPH insulin in a 5 - year randomized clinical trial that evaluated the progression of retinopathy as assessed with fundus photography using a grading protocol derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale ( ETDRS ) .
Patients had type 2 diabetes ( mean age 55 years ) with no ( 86 % ) or mild ( 14 % ) retinopathy at baseline .
Mean baseline HbA1c was 8 . 4 % .
The primary outcome was progression by 3 or more steps on the ETDRS scale at study endpoint .
Patients with prespecified postbaseline eye procedures ( pan - retinal photocoagulation for proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy , local photocoagulation for new vessels , and vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy ) were also considered as 3 - step progressors regardless of actual change in ETDRS score from baseline .
Retinopathy graders were blinded to treatment group assignment .
The results for the primary endpoint are shown in Table 13 for both the per - protocol and intent - to - treat populations , and indicate similarity of LANTUS to NPH in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as assessed by this outcome .

One intervention in ORIGIN compared the effect of LANTUS to standard care on major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in 12 , 537 participants ≥ 50 years of age with abnormal glucose levels ( i . e . , impaired fasting glucose [ IFG ] and / or impaired glucose tolerance [ IGT ] ) or early type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular ( i . e . , CV ) disease or CV risk factors at baseline .
The objective of the trial was to demonstrate that LANTUS use could significantly lower the risk of major cardiovascular outcomes compared to standard care .
Two coprimary composite cardiovascular endpoints were used in ORIGIN .
The first coprimary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event defined as the composite of CV death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , and nonfatal stroke .
The second coprimary endpoint was the time to the first occurrence of CV death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke or revascularization procedure or hospitalization for heart failure .
Participants were randomized to either LANTUS ( N = 6264 ) titrated to a goal fasting plasma glucose of ≤ 95 mg / dL or to standard care ( N = 6273 ) .
Anthropometric and disease characteristics were balanced at baseline .
The mean age was 64 years and 8 % of participants were 75 years of age or older .
The majority of participants were male ( 65 % ) .
Fifty nine percent were Caucasian , 25 % were Latin , 10 % were Asian and 3 % were Black .
The median baseline BMI was 29 kg / m2 .
Approximately 12 % of participants had abnormal glucose levels ( IGT and / or IFG ) at baseline and 88 % had type 2 diabetes .
For patients with type 2 diabetes , 59 % were treated with a single oral antidiabetic drug , 23 % had known diabetes but were on no antidiabetic drug and 6 % were newly diagnosed during the screening procedure .
The mean HbA1c ( SD ) at baseline was 6 . 5 % ( 1 . 0 ) .
Fifty - nine percent of participants had had a prior cardiovascular event and 39 % had documented coronary artery disease or other cardiovascular risk factors .
Vital status was available for 99 . 9 % and 99 . 8 % of participants randomized to LANTUS and standard care respectively at end of trial .
The median duration of follow - up was 6 . 2 years ( range : 8 days to 7 . 9 years ) .
The mean HbA1c ( SD ) at the end of the trial was 6 . 5 % ( 1 . 1 ) and 6 . 8 % ( 1 . 2 ) in the LANTUS and standard care group respectively .
The median dose of LANTUS at end of trial was 0 . 45 U / kg .
Eighty - one percent of patients randomized to LANTUS were using LANTUS at end of the study .
The mean change in body weight from baseline to the last treatment visit was 2 . 2 kg greater in the LANTUS group than in the standard care group .
Overall , the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular outcomes was similar between groups ( see Table 14 ) .
All - cause mortality was also similar between groups .

What is LANTUS ?
LANTUS is a long - acting man - made - insulin used to control high blood sugar in adults with diabetes mellitus .
• LANTUS is not for use to treat diabetic ketoacidosis .
• It is not known if LANTUS is safe and effective in children less than 6 years of age with type 1 diabetes .
• It is not known if LANTUS is safe and effective in children with type 2 diabetes .
Who should not use LANTUS ?
Do not use LANTUS if you : • are having an episode of low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) .
• have an allergy to insulin glargine or any of the ingredients in LANTUS .
See the end of this Patient Information leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in LANTUS .
What should I tell my healthcare provider before using LANTUS ?
Before using LANTUS , tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions including if you : • have liver or kidney problems .
• take other medicines , especially ones called TZDs ( thiazolidinediones ) .
• have heart failure or other heart problems .
If you have heart failure , it may get worse while you take TZDs with LANTUS .
• are pregnant , planning to become pregnant , or are breastfeeding .
It is not known if LANTUS may harm your unborn baby or breastfeeding baby .
Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take including prescription and over - the - counter medicines , vitamins , and herbal supplements .
Before you start using LANTUS , talk to your healthcare provider about low blood sugar and how to manage it .
How should I use LANTUS ?
• Read the detailed Instructions for Use that come with your LANTUS insulin .
• Use LANTUS exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to .
Your healthcare provider should tell you how much LANTUS to use and when to use it .
• Know the amount of LANTUS you use .
Do not change the amount of LANTUS you use unless your healthcare provider tells you to .
• Check your insulin label each time you give your injection to make sure you are using the correct insulin .
• Do not re - use needles .
Always use a new needle for each injection .
Re - use of needles increases your risk of having blocked needles , which may cause you to get the wrong dose of LANTUS .
Using a new needle for each injection lowers your risk of getting an infection .
• You may take LANTUS at any time during the day but you must take it at the same time every day .
• Only use LANTUS that is clear and colorless .
If your LANTUS is cloudy or slightly colored , return it to your pharmacy for a replacement .
• LANTUS is injected under the skin ( subcutaneously ) of your upper legs ( thighs ) , upper arms , or stomach area ( abdomen ) .
• Do not use LANTUS in an insulin pump or inject LANTUS into your vein ( intravenously ) .
• Change ( rotate ) injection sites within the area you chose with each dose to reduce your risk of getting lipodystrophy ( pits in skin or thickened skin ) and localized cutaneous amyloidosis ( skin with lumps ) at the injection sites .
• Do not use the exact same spot for each injection .
• Do not inject where the skin has pits , is thickened , or has lumps .
• Do not inject where the skin is tender , bruised , scaly or hard , or into scars or damaged skin .
• Do not mix LANTUS with any other type of insulin or liquid medicine .
• Check your blood sugar levels .
Ask your healthcare provider what your blood sugar should be and when you should check your blood sugar levels .
Keep LANTUS and all medicines out of the reach of children .
Your dose of LANTUS may need to change because of : • a change in level of physical activity or exercise , weight gain or loss , increased stress , illness , change in diet , or because of the medicines you take .
What should I avoid while using LANTUS ?
While using LANTUS do not : • drive or operate heavy machinery , until you know how LANTUS affects you .
• drink alcohol or use over - the - counter medicines that contain alcohol .
What are the possible side effects of LANTUS and other insulins ?
LANTUS may cause serious side effects that can lead to death , including : • low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) .
