CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Concept OBTM also supplies important prenatal vitamin minerals in a formulation that was especially designed to supplement the nutritional needs of pregnant women , before , during and after pregnancy .
In Concept OBTM , patients receive the balanced support of 14 essential vitamins and minerals , including 1 mg of folic acid .
The essential role of iron supplementation for pregnant women has long been recognized .
Concept OBTM is unique in that it utilizes two ( 2 ) different forms of iron , i . e . , Ferrous Fumarate and Polysaccharide Iron Complex ( as cell - contracted akagane ̀ ite ) , making available a total of 85 mg of elemental iron per capsule as follows : Ferrous Fumarate ( anhydrous ) 130 mg Polysaccharide iron complex ( PIC ) 92 . 4 mg Ferrous Fumarate : Provides about 42 . 5 mg of elemental iron per dose .
Ferrous Fumarate is an anhydrous salt of a combination of ferrous iron and fumaric acid , containing 33 % of iron per weight .
The acute toxicity in experimental animals is low and Ferrous Fumarate is well tolerated clinically .
As a ferrous salt , it is more efficiently absorbed in the duodenum .
Ferrous Fumarate contrasts very favorably with the availability of the 20 % of elemental iron of ferrous sulfate , and the 13 % of elemental iron of ferrous gluconate .
Polysaccharide Iron Complex : Provides about 42 . 5 mg elemental iron , as a cell - contracted akagane ̀ ite .
It is a product of ferric iron complexed to a low molecular weight polysaccharide .
This polysaccharide is produced by the extensive hydrolysis of starch and is a dark brown powder that dissolves in water to form a very dark brown solution , which is virtually odorless and tasteless .
The most frequent cause of anemia in pregnant women is iron deficiency .
Because of the continuous loss of iron due to monthly menstruation , most women enter pregnancy with less than optimal iron stores .
Supplementation of iron must suffice to meet the needs for maternal and fetal erythropoisis , and account for daily maternal gastrointestinal losses and obligate fetal transfer and growth .
Iron requirements during pregnancy usually cannot be met with the average diet .
( ACOG technical bulletin ( 1993 ) : Nutrition during Pregnancy .
p . 4 .
Number 179 - April 1993 : The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , Washington , D . C . 20024 - 2188 ) .
Concept OBTM does not contain calcium , as calcium may inhibit iron absorption because of the binding or conversion of ferrous salts by calcium and other minerals .
Calcium salts can always be prescribed separately for women at high nutritional risk , including those who do not eat adequate amounts of dairy products .
The recommendation of the National Academy of Sciences Tenth Ed .
1989 National Academy Press , Washington , D . C . , suggests the supplementation of 1200 mg of calcium for pregnant and lactating women for the prevention of calcium deficiency .
Folic acid is a hematopoetic vitamin and has been used extensively for the prevention of neural tube defects .
The need for folic acid in pregnancy , with its increased demands of the fetus , or lactation , is not being met by normal dietary sources .
Concept OBTM capsules contain 1 mg of folic acid .
Neural tube defects ( NTD ' s ) are the most common birth defects that result in infant mortality and serious disability .
For women with a previous pregnancy that resulted in a child with a neural tube malformation , the use of 4 mg / d of folic acid has been reported to be effective in preventing a recurrence ( MRC Vitamin Study Research Group , 1991 ) .
However , earlier studies from the United Kingdom suggested that lower daily doses , for example 0 . 36 mg , might result in a comparable reduction of a recurrence of NTD ' s .
Since neural tube closure is complete by four weeks following conception , beginning folic acid supplementation after that time is not likely to be of any value .
It should be noted that a daily 4 mg dose of folic acid did not prevent all NTD ' s in the MRC study .
Patients should be cautioned that folic acid supplementation does not preclude the need for consideration for prenatal testing for NTD ' s ( ACOG Committee Opinion , Number 120 , March 1993 : The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , Washington D . C . 20024 - 2188 ) .
The U . S . Public Health Service has recommended that all women of childbearing age in the United States who are capable of becoming pregnant should consume 0 . 4 mg of folic acid per day for reducing their risk of having a pregnancy affected with spina bifida or other NTD ' s ( Center of Disease Control , 1992 ) .
Recommendation for the use of folic acid to reduce the number of cases of spina bifida and other neural tube defects : MMWR 1992 : 41 ( RR14 ) : 1 - 7 ) .
Concept OBTM has been formulated without the addition of vitamins A , D , E and K .
These fat - soluble vitamins can accumulate and lead to birth defects .
Supplementation of vitamins A , D , E and K should be based on an individual need assessment .
All ConceptTM products include a unique patented source of iron , e . g . Ferrous Fumarate and Polysaccharide Iron Complex ( U . S . Patent No : 11 / 243 , 043 Pending ) .
An increase in tolerability is observed with the ( patented formulation ) and is believed to occur as the result of distributing the total iron content in the composition among compounds that NDC 52747 - 620 - 30 Concept OBTM Prescription Prenatal Postnatal Vitamin Mineral Capsules 52747620300709 Back side Concept OB LC - 10807 Rev 07 / 2009 provide iron to the patient ' s blood stream via two different mechanisms .
The ferrous salts are readily absorbed in the upper gut , by direct dissolution and absorption of the ferrous iron by the bloodstream .
However , the iron available from PIC is absorbed in the lower gut , via an active protein transport mechanism " .
The Concept OBTM formulation also supplies additional important prenatal vitamin and minerals , which supplement the nutritional needs of pregnant women , before , during and after pregnancy .
Deficiencies of these ingredients are common during pregnancy and lactation .
Clinical Studies : Because Ferrous Fumarate is an organic complex , it contains no free ions , either ferric or ferrous .
Polysaccharide Iron Complex is clinically non - toxic .
Prior studies in rats demonstrated that Polysaccharide Iron Complex ( PIC ) , administered as a single oral dose to Sprague Dawley rats did not produce evidence of toxicity at a dosage level of 5000 mg Iron / kg : ( An Acute Oral Toxicity Study in Rats with Polysaccharide - Iron Complex .
T . N . Merriman , M . Aikman and R . E . Rush , Springborn Laboratories .
Inc .
Spencerville , Ohio Study No . 3340 . 1 March - April 1994 ) .
Other clinical studies had demonstrated that Polysaccharide Iron gives a good hematopoietic response with an almost complete absence of the side effects usually associated with oral iron therapy .
Picinni and Ricciotti suggested in 1982 , that " the therapeutic effectiveness of Polysaccharide Iron Complex when compared with iron fumarate in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia , appears to be as active as the iron fumarate and as well tolerated , however , it exerted a greater influence on the level of hemoglobin and on the number of red cells ... " and that , " it has been exceptionally well tolerated by all patients " ( Picinni , L . - Ricciotti , M . 1982 .
Therapeutic effectiveness of an iron - polysaccharide complex in comparison with iron fumarate in the treatment of iron deficiency anemias ) : PANMINERVA MEDICA - EUROPA MEDICA , Vol .
24 , No . 3 , pp . 213 - 220 ( July - September 1982 ) .
As mentioned above , the patented source of iron used in Concept OBTM ( Ferrous Fumarate and Polysaccharide Iron Complex ) provides a high level of elemental iron with a low incidence of gastric distress .
CONCLUSION : Based on the results of this study , the oral combination of Ferrous Fumarate and Polysaccharide Iron Complex was better tolerated and safer than the oral administration of Ferrous Fumarate alone .
The conclusion of this research stated , that the addition of PIC to Ferrous Fumarate surprisingly allows the same concentration of Ferrous Fumarate to be better tolerated than the Ferrous Fumarate alone .
INDICATIONS : Concept OBTM is a prenatal supplement designed to improve the nutritional status for women throughout pregnancy and during the postnatal period to lactating and non - lactating mothers .
Concept OBTM may also be used to improve the nutritional status of women before conception .
CONTRAINDICATIONS : Concept OBTM is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients ; also , all iron compounds are contraindicated in patients with hemosiderosis , hemochromatosis , or hemolytic anemias .
Pernicious anemia is a contraindication , as folic acid may obscure its signs and symptoms .
WARNING : Accidental overdose of iron - containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6 .
Keep this product out of reach of children .
In case of accidental overdose , call a doctor or poison control center immediately .
WARNING : Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment for pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where Vitamin B12 is deficient .
PRECAUTIONS : General : Folic acid in doses above 0 . 1 mg - 0 . 4 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia , in that hematological remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive .
Pediatric Use : Safety and effectiveness of this product have not been established in pediatric patients .
Geriatric Use : No clinical studies have been performed in patients age 65 and over to determine whether older persons respond differently from younger persons .
Dosage should always begin at the low end of the dosage scale and should consider that elderly persons may have decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function and or concomitant diseases .
Adverse Reactions : Folic Acid : Allergic sensitizations have been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid .
Ferrous Fumarate : Gastrointestinal disturbances ( anorexia , nausea , diarrhea , constipation ) occur occasionally , but are usually mild and may subside with continuation of therapy .
Although the absorption of iron is best when taken between meals , giving Concept OBTM after meals may control occasional G . I . disturbances .
Concept OBTM is best absorbed when taken at bedtime .
