( 5 . 2 ) • • Hyperglycemia or Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State : Monitor blood glucose and administer insulin as needed .
( 5 . 3 , 8 . 4 ) • • Hyponatremia , Hypernatremia and Hyperchloremia : Avoid in patients with or at risk for hypo - / hypernatremia .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor serum sodium concentrations .
( 5 . 4 , 5 . 5 , 8 . 4 ) • • Fluid Overload : Avoid in patients with or at risk for fluid and / or solute overloading .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor daily fluid balance and electrolyte , concentrations and acid - base balance , as needed and especially during prolonged use .
( 5 . 6 ) • • Refeeding Syndrome : Monitor severely undernourished patients and slowly increase nutrient intake .
( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity and infusion reactions , including anaphylaxis , have been reported with Potassium Chloride in Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Stop the infusion immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity or infusion reaction develops [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Appropriate therapeutic countermeasures must be instituted as clinically indicated .
5 . 2 Hyperkalemia Potassium - containing solutions , including Potassium Chloride in Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection may increase the risk of hyperkalemia .
Hyperkalemia can be asymptomatic and manifest only by increased serum potassium concentrations and / or characteristic electrocardiographic ( ECG ) changes .
Cardiac arrhythmias , some fatal , can develop at any time during hyperkalemia .
To avoid life threatening hyperkalemia , do not administer Potassium Chloride in Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection as an intravenous push ( i . e . , intravenous injection manually with a syringe connected to the intravenous access , without quantitative infusion device [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Patients at increased risk of developing hyperkalemia and cardiac arrhythmias include those : • • with severe renal impairment , acute dehydration , extensive tissue injury or burns , and certain cardiac disorders such as congestive heart failure or AV block ( especially if they receive digoxin ) .
• • with hyperosmolality , acidosis , or undergoing correction of alkalosis ( conditions associated with a shift of potassium from intracellular to extracellular space ) .
• • treated concurrently or recently with agents or products that can cause or increase the risk of hyperkalemia [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Avoid use of Potassium Chloride in Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with , or at risk for , hyperkalemia .
If use cannot be avoided , use a product with a low amount of potassium chloride , infuse slowly and monitor serum potassium concentrations and ECGs .
5 . 3 Hyperglycemia and Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State The use of dextrose infusions in patients with impaired glucose tolerance may worsen hyperglycemia .
Administration of dextrose at a rate exceeding the patient ’ s utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia , coma , and death .
Hyperglycemia is associated with an increase in serum osmolality , resulting in osmotic diuresis , dehydration and electrolyte losses [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
Patients with underlying central nervous system disease and renal impairment who receive dextrose infusions , may be at greater risk of developing hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state .
Monitor blood glucose concentrations and treat hyperglycemia to maintain concentrations within normal limits while administering Potassium Chloride in Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection .
Insulin may be administered or adjusted to maintain optimal blood glucose concentrations .
5 . 4 Hyponatremia Potassium Chloride in Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection is a hypertonic solution [ see Description , Table 1 ( 11 ) ] .
In the body , however , glucose containing fluids can become extremely physiologically hypotonic due to rapid glucose metabolization .
Monitoring of serum sodium is particularly important for hypotonic fluids .
Depending on the tonicity of the solution , the volume and rate of infusion , and depending on a patient ’ s underlying clinical condition and capability to metabolize glucose , intravenous administration of glucose can cause electrolyte disturbances , most importantly hypo - or hyperosmotic hyponatremia .
The risk for hyponatremia is increased , in pediatric patients , elderly patients , postoperative patients , those with psychogenic polydipsia and in patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia ( such as certain diuretic , antiepileptic and psychotropic medications ) .
Close clinical monitoring may be warranted .
Acute hyponatremia can lead to acute hyponatremic encephalopathy characterized by headache , nausea , seizures , lethargy and vomiting .
Patients with brain edema are at particular risk of severe , irreversible and life - threatening brain injury .
Patients at increased risk for developing complications of hyponatremia , such as hyponatremic encephalopathy include pediatric patients ; women , in particular , premenopausal women ; patients with hypoxemia ; and in patients with underlying central nervous system disease [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 , 8 . 5 ) ] .
Avoid solutions with less than 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride in patients with or at risk for hyponatremia .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor serum sodium concentrations .
Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome with risk of seizures and cerebral edema .
To avoid complications , monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations , fluid status , acid - base balance , and signs of neurologic complications .
High volume infusion must be used with close monitoring in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure , and in patients with non - osmotic vasopressin release ( including SIADH ) , due to the risk of hospital - acquired hyponatremia .
5 . 5 Hypernatremia and Hyperchloremia Electrolyte imbalances such as hypernatremia and hyperchloremia , leading to metabolic acidosis may occur with solutions containing 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride .
Conditions that may increase the risk of hypernatremia , fluid overload and edema ( central and peripheral ) , include patients with pre - eclampsia , primary hyperaldosteronism and secondary hyperaldosteronism associated with , for example , hypertension , congestive heart failure , severe renal insufficiency , liver disease ( including cirrhosis ) , and renal disease ( including renal artery stenosis , nephrosclerosis ) .
Medications such as corticosteroids or corticotropin , may increase the risk of sodium and fluid retention .
Avoid in patients with or at risk for hypernatremia .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor serum sodium concentrations .
Rapid correction of hypernatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications .
Excessively rapid correction of hypernatremia is also associated with a risk for serious neurologic complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome ( ODS ) with risk of seizures and cerebral edema .
5 . 6 Fluid Overload Depending on the volume and rate of infusion , the patient ’ s underlying clinical condition and capability to metabolize dextrose , intravenous administration of Potassium Chloride in Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection can cause fluid and / or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
Avoid Potassium Chloride in Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with or at risk for fluid and / or solute overloading .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor fluid balance , electrolyte concentrations , and acid - base balance as needed and especially during prolonged use .
5 . 7 Refeeding Syndrome Refeeding severely undernourished patients may result in the refeeding syndrome that is characterized by the shift of potassium , phosphorus , and magnesium intracellularly as the patient becomes anabolic .
Thiamine deficiency and fluid retention may also develop .
To prevent these complications , monitor severely undernourished patients and slowly increasing nutrient intake .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions associated with the use of Potassium Chloride in Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection were identified in postmarketing reports .
