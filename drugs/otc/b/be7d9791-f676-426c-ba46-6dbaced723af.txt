( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS VENTOLIN HFA is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to albuterol or any other components of VENTOLIN HFA .
Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions , including urticaria , angioedema , and rash have been reported after the use of albuterol sulfate .
Hypersensitivity to albuterol sulfate or any of the ingredients of VENTOLIN HFA .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur and should be treated immediately with alternative therapy .
( 5 . 1 ) • Need for more doses of VENTOLIN HFA than usual may be a sign of deterioration of asthma and requires reevaluation of treatment .
( 5 . 2 ) • Cardiovascular effects may occur with beta - adrenergic agonists use .
Consider discontinuation of VENTOLIN HFA if these effects occur .
Use with caution in patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders .
( 5 . 4 ) • Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur .
Discontinue VENTOLIN HFA if immediate hypersensitivity reactions occur .
( 5 . 6 ) 5 . 1 Paradoxical Bronchospasm Inhaled albuterol sulfate can produce paradoxical bronchospasm , which may be life threatening .
If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs , VENTOLIN HFA should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted .
It should be recognized that paradoxical bronchospasm , when associated with inhaled formulations , frequently occurs with the first use of a new canister .
5 . 2 Deterioration of Asthma Asthma may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer .
If the patient needs more doses of VENTOLIN HFA than usual , this may be a marker of destabilization of asthma and requires reevaluation of the patient and treatment regimen , giving special consideration to the possible need for anti - inflammatory treatment , e . g . , corticosteroids .
5 . 3 Use of Anti - Inflammatory Agents The use of beta - adrenergic agonist bronchodilators alone may not be adequate to control asthma in many patients .
Early consideration should be given to adding anti - inflammatory agents , e . g . , corticosteroids , to the therapeutic regimen .
5 . 4 Cardiovascular Effects VENTOLIN HFA , like all other beta2 - adrenergic agonists , can produce clinically significant cardiovascular effects in some patients such as changes in pulse rate or blood pressure .
If such effects occur , VENTOLIN HFA may need to be discontinued .
In addition , beta - agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram ( ECG ) changes , such as flattening of the T wave , prolongation of the QTc interval , and ST segment depression .
The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown .
Therefore , VENTOLIN HFA , like all other sympathomimetic amines , should be used with caution in patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders , especially coronary insufficiency , cardiac arrhythmias , and hypertension .
5 . 5 Do Not Exceed Recommended Dose Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs in patients with asthma .
The exact cause of death is unknown , but cardiac arrest following an unexpected development of a severe acute asthmatic crisis and subsequent hypoxia is suspected .
5 . 6 Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol , as demonstrated by cases of urticaria , angioedema , rash , bronchospasm , anaphylaxis , and oropharyngeal edema .
Discontinue VENTOLIN HFA if immediate hypersensitivity reactions occur .
5 . 7 Coexisting Conditions VENTOLIN HFA , like other sympathomimetic amines , should be used with caution in patients with convulsive disorders , hyperthyroidism , or diabetes mellitus and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines .
Large doses of intravenous albuterol have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis .
5 . 8 Hypokalemia As with other beta - agonists , albuterol may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients , possibly through intracellular shunting , which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects .
The decrease is usually transient , not requiring supplementation .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Use of VENTOLIN HFA may be associated with the following : • Paradoxical bronchospasm [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Cardiovascular effects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Immediate hypersensitivity reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Hypokalemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 3 % ) are throat irritation , viral respiratory infections , upper respiratory inflammation , cough , and musculoskeletal pain .
( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact GlaxoSmithKline at 1 - 888 - 825 - 5249 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience The safety data described below reflects exposure to VENTOLIN HFA in 248 patients treated with VENTOLIN HFA in 3 placebo - controlled clinical trials of 2 to 12 weeks ’ duration .
The data from adults and adolescents is based upon 2 clinical trials in which 202 patients with asthma 12 years of age and older were treated with VENTOLIN HFA 2 inhalations 4 times daily for 12 weeks ’ duration .
The adult / adolescent population was 92 female , 110 male and 163 white , 19 black , 18 Hispanic , 2 other .
The data from pediatric patients are based upon 1 clinical trial in which 46 patients with asthma 4 to 11 years of age were treated with VENTOLIN HFA 2 inhalations 4 times daily for 2 weeks ’ duration .
The population was 21 female , 25 male and 25 white , 17 black , 3 Hispanic , 1 other .
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older : The two 12 - week , randomized , double - blind studies in 610 adolescent and adult patients with asthma that compared VENTOLIN HFA , a CFC 11 / 12 - propelled albuterol inhaler , and an HFA - 134 a placebo inhaler .
Overall , the incidence and nature of the adverse reactions reported for VENTOLIN HFA and a CFC 11 / 12 - propelled albuterol inhaler were comparable .
Table 1 lists the incidence of all adverse reactions ( whether considered by the investigator to be related or unrelated to drug ) from these studies that occurred at a rate of 3 % or greater in the group treated with VENTOLIN HFA and more frequently in the group treated with VENTOLIN HFA than in the HFA - 134 a placebo inhaler group .
Table 1 .
Overall Adverse Reactions With ≥ 3 % Incidence in 2 Large 12 - Week Clinical Trials in Adolescents and Adults * Adverse Reaction Percent of Patients VENTOLIN HFA ( n = 202 ) % CFC 11 / 12 - Propelled Albuterol Inhaler ( n = 207 ) % Placebo HFA - 134 a ( n = 201 ) % Ear , nose , and throat Throat irritation 10 6 7 Upper respiratory inflammation 5 5 2 Lower respiratory Viral respiratory infections 7 4 4 Cough 5 2 2 Musculoskeletal Musculoskeletal pain 5 5 4 * This table includes all adverse reactions ( whether considered by the investigator to be drug - related or unrelated to drug ) that occurred at an incidence rate of at least 3 . 0 % in the group treated with VENTOLIN HFA and more frequently in the group treated with VENTOLIN HFA than in the HFA - 134 a placebo inhaler group .
Adverse reactions reported by less than 3 % of the adolescent and adult patients receiving VENTOLIN HFA and by a greater proportion of patients receiving VENTOLIN HFA than receiving HFA - 134 a placebo inhaler and that have the potential to be related to VENTOLIN HFA include diarrhea , laryngitis , oropharyngeal edema , cough , lung disorders , tachycardia , and extrasystoles .
Palpitation and dizziness have also been observed with VENTOLIN HFA .
Pediatric Patients : Results from the 2 - week pediatric clinical study in patients with asthma 4 to 11 years of age showed that this pediatric population had an adverse reaction profile similar to that of the adolescent and adult populations .
Three studies have been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VENTOLIN HFA in patients between birth and 4 years of age .
The results of these studies did not establish the efficacy of VENTOLIN HFA in this age - group [ see Pediatric Use ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Since the efficacy of VENTOLIN HFA has not been demonstrated in children between birth and 48 months of age , the safety of VENTOLIN HFA in this age - group cannot be established .
However , the safety profile observed in the pediatric population under 4 years of age was comparable to that observed in the older pediatric patients and in adolescents and adults .
Where adverse reaction incidence rates were greater in patients under 4 years of age compared with older patients , the higher incidence rates were noted in all treatment arms , including placebo .
These adverse reactions included upper respiratory tract infection , nasopharyngitis , pyrexia , and tachycardia .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to the adverse reactions listed in section 6 . 1 , the following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of VENTOLIN HFA .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Cases of paradoxical bronchospasm , hoarseness , arrhythmias ( including atrial fibrillation , supraventricular tachycardia ) , and hypersensitivity reactions ( including urticaria , angioedema , rash ) have been reported after the use of VENTOLIN HFA .
In addition , albuterol , like other sympathomimetic agents , can cause adverse reactions such as hypokalemia , hypertension , peripheral vasodilatation , angina , tremor , central nervous system stimulation , hyperactivity , sleeplessness , headache , muscle cramps , and drying or irritation of the oropharynx .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Other short - acting sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators should not be used concomitantly with albuterol .
If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route , they should be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular effects .
• Beta - blockers : May block bronchodilatory effects of beta - agonists and produce severe bronchospasm .
Patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta - blockers .
( 7 . 1 ) • Diuretics : Electrocardiographic changes and / or hypokalemia associated with diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta - agonists .
Consider monitoring potassium levels .
( 7 . 2 ) • Monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOs ) or tricyclic antidepressants : May potentiate effect of albuterol on the vascular system .
Consider alternative therapy in patients taking MAOs or tricyclic antidepressants .
( 7 . 4 ) Revised : June 2009 VNT : 6 PI 7 . 1 Beta - Blockers Beta - adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta - agonists , such as VENTOLIN HFA , but may produce severe bronchospasm in patients with asthma .
Therefore , patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta - blockers .
However , under certain circumstances , e . g . , as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction , there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta - adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma .
In this setting , cardioselective beta - blockers should be considered , although they should be administered with caution .
7 . 2 Diuretics The ECG changes and / or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of nonpotassium - sparing diuretics ( such as loop or thiazide diuretics ) can be acutely worsened by beta - agonists , especially when the recommended dose of the beta - agonist is exceeded .
Although the clinical relevance of these effects is not known , caution is advised in the coadministration of beta - agonists with nonpotassium - sparing diuretics .
Consider monitoring potassium levels .
7 . 3 Digoxin Mean decreases of 16 % to 22 % in serum digoxin levels were demonstrated after single - dose intravenous and oral administration of albuterol , respectively , to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days .
The clinical relevance of these findings for patients with obstructive airway disease who are receiving inhaled albuterol and digoxin on a chronic basis is unclear .
Nevertheless , it would be prudent to carefully evaluate the serum digoxin levels in patients who are currently receiving digoxin and albuterol .
7 . 4 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants VENTOLIN HFA should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants , or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents , because the action of albuterol on the vascular system may be potentiated .
Consider alternative therapy in patients taking MAOs or tricyclic antidepressants .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category C .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of VENTOLIN HFA or albuterol sulfate in pregnant women .
During worldwide marketing experience , various congenital anomalies , including cleft palate and limb defects , have been reported in the offspring of patients being treated with albuterol .
Some of the mothers were taking multiple medications during their pregnancies .
No consistent pattern of defects can be discerned , and a relationship between albuterol use and congenital anomalies has not been established .
Animal reproduction studies in mice and rabbits revealed evidence of teratogenicity .
VENTOLIN HFA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
In a mouse reproduction study , subcutaneously administered albuterol sulfate produced cleft palate formation in 5 of 111 ( 4 . 5 % ) fetuses at exposures approximately equal to the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) for adults on a mg / m2 basis and in 10 of 108 ( 9 . 3 % ) fetuses at approximately 8 times the MRHD .
Similar effects were not observed at approximately one eleventh of the MRHD .
Cleft palate also occurred in 22 of 72 ( 30 . 5 % ) fetuses from females treated subcutaneously with isoproterenol ( positive control ) .
In a rabbit reproduction study , orally administered albuterol sulfate produced cranioschisis in 7 of 19 fetuses ( 37 % ) at approximately 680 times the MRHD .
In another rabbit study , an albuterol sulfate / HFA - 134 a formulation administered by inhalation produced enlargement of the frontal portion of the fetal fontanelles at approximately one third of the MRHD [ see Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology ( 13 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 2 Labor and Delivery Because of the potential for beta - agonist interference with uterine contractility , use of VENTOLIN HFA for relief of bronchospasm during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risk .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Plasma levels of albuterol sulfate and HFA - 134 a after inhaled therapeutic doses are very low in humans , but it is not known whether the components of VENTOLIN HFA are excreted in human milk .
Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for albuterol in animal studies and lack of experience with the use of VENTOLIN HFA by nursing mothers , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
Caution should be exercised when VENTOLIN HFA is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of VENTOLIN HFA in children 4 years of age and older has been established based upon two 12 - week clinical trials in patients 12 years of age and older with asthma and one 2 - week clinical trial in patients 4 to 11 years of age with asthma [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of VENTOLIN HFA in children under 4 years of age has not been established .
Three studies have been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VENTOLIN HFA in patients under 4 years of age and the findings are described below .
Two 4 - week randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled studies were conducted in 163 pediatric patients from birth to 48 months of age with symptoms of bronchospasm associated with obstructive airway disease ( presenting symptoms included : wheeze , cough , dyspnea , or chest tightness ) .
VENTOLIN HFA or placebo HFA was delivered with either an AeroChamber Plus ® Valved Holding Chamber or an Optichamber ® Valved Holding Chamber with mask 3 times daily .
In one study , VENTOLIN HFA 90 mcg ( N = 26 ) , VENTOLIN HFA 180 mcg ( N = 25 ) , and placebo HFA ( N = 26 ) were administered to children between 24 and 48 months of age .
In the second study , VENTOLIN HFA 90 mcg ( N = 29 ) , VENTOLIN HFA 180 mcg ( N = 29 ) , and placebo HFA ( N = 28 ) were administered to children between birth and 24 months of age .
Over the 4 - week treatment period , there were no treatment differences in asthma symptom scores between the groups receiving VENTOLIN HFA 90 mcg , VENTOLIN HFA 180 mcg , and placebo in either study .
In a third study , VENTOLIN HFA was evaluated in 87 pediatric patients younger than 24 months of age for the treatment of acute wheezing .
VENTOLIN HFA was delivered with an AeroChamber Plus Valved Holding Chamber in this study .
There were no significant differences in asthma symptom scores and mean change from baseline in an asthma symptom score between VENTOLIN HFA 180 mcg and VENTOLIN HFA 360 mcg .
In vitro dose characterization studies were performed to evaluate the delivery of VENTOLIN HFA via holding chambers with facemasks .
The studies were conducted with 2 different holding chambers with facemasks ( small and medium size ) .
The in vitro study data when simulated to patients suggest that the dose of VENTOLIN HFA presented for inhalation via a valved holding chamber with facemask will be comparable to the dose delivered in adults without a spacer and facemask per kilogram of body weight ( Table 2 ) .
However , clinical studies in children under 4 years of age described above suggest that either the optimal dose of VENTOLIN HFA has not been defined in this age - group or VENTOLIN HFA is not effective in this age - group .
The safety and effectiveness of VENTOLIN HFA administered with or without a spacer device in children under 4 years of age has not been demonstrated .

Ranges correspond to the average of the 50 th percentile weight for boys and girls at the ages indicated .
† A single inhalation of VENTOLIN HFA in a 70 - kg adult without use of a valved holding chamber and facemask delivers approximately 90 mcg , or 1 . 3 mcg / kg .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of VENTOLIN HFA did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
10 OVERDOSAGE The expected symptoms with overdosage are those of excessive beta - adrenergic stimulation and / or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the symptoms listed under ADVERSE REACTIONS , e . g . , seizures , angina , hypertension or hypotension , tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats / min , arrhythmias , nervousness , headache , tremor , dry mouth , palpitation , nausea , dizziness , fatigue , malaise , sleeplessness .
Hypokalemia may also occur .
As with all sympathomimetic aerosol medications , cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with abuse of VENTOLIN HFA .
Treatment consists of discontinuation of VENTOLIN HFA together with appropriate symptomatic therapy .
The judicious use of a cardioselective beta - receptor blocker may be considered , bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm .
There is insufficient evidence to determine if dialysis is beneficial for overdosage of VENTOLIN HFA .
The oral median lethal dose of albuterol sulfate in mice is greater than 2 , 000 mg / kg ( approximately 6 , 800 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg / m2 basis and approximately 3 , 200 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for children on a mg / m2 basis ) .
In mature rats , the subcutaneous median lethal dose of albuterol sulfate is approximately 450 mg / kg ( approximately 3 , 000 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg / m2 basis and approximately 1 , 400 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for children on a mg / m2 basis ) .
In young rats , the subcutaneous median lethal dose is approximately 2 , 000 mg / kg ( approximately 14 , 000 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg / m2 basis and approximately 6 , 400 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for children on a mg / m2 basis ) .
The inhalation median lethal dose has not been determined in animals .
11 DESCRIPTION The active component of VENTOLIN HFA is albuterol sulfate , USP , the racemic form of albuterol and a relatively selective beta2 - adrenergic bronchodilator .
Albuterol sulfate has the chemical name α1 - [ ( tert - butylamino ) methyl ] - 4 - hydroxy - m - xylene - α , α ′ - diol sulfate ( 2 : 1 ) ( salt ) and the following chemical structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Albuterol sulfate is a white crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 576 . 7 , and the empirical formula is ( C13H21NO3 ) 2 • H2SO4 .
It is soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol .
The World Health Organization recommended name for albuterol base is salbutamol .
VENTOLIN HFA is a pressurized metered - dose aerosol unit fitted with a counter .
VENTOLIN HFA is intended for oral inhalation only .
Each unit contains a microcrystalline suspension of albuterol sulfate in propellant HFA - 134 a ( 1 , 1 , 1 , 2 - tetrafluoroethane ) .
It contains no other excipients .
Priming VENTOLIN HFA is essential to ensure appropriate albuterol content in each actuation .
To prime the inhaler , release 4 sprays into the air away from the face , shaking well before each spray .
The inhaler should be primed before using it for the first time , when it has not been used for more than 2 weeks , or when it has been dropped .
After priming , each actuation of the inhaler delivers 120 mcg of albuterol sulfate , USP in 75 mg of suspension from the valve and 108 mcg of albuterol sulfate , USP from the mouthpiece ( equivalent to 90 mcg of albuterol base from the mouthpiece ) .
Each 18 - g canister provides 200 inhalations .
Each 8 - g canister provides 60 inhalations .
This product does not contain chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) as the propellant .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action In vitro studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that albuterol has a preferential effect on beta2 - adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol .
While it is recognized that beta2 - adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle , data indicate that there is a population of beta2 - receptors in the human heart existing in a concentration between 10 % and 50 % of cardiac beta - adrenergic receptors .
The precise function of these receptors has not been established [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Activation of beta2 - adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of adenylcyclase and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic - 3 ′ , 5 ′ - adenosine monophosphate ( cyclic AMP ) .
This increase of cyclic AMP leads to the activation of protein kinase A , which inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations , resulting in relaxation .
Albuterol relaxes the smooth muscles of all airways , from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles .
Albuterol acts as a functional antagonist to relax the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved , thus protecting against all bronchoconstrictor challenges .
Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of release of mediators from mast cells in the airway .
Albuterol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract , in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation , than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects .
Controlled clinical studies and other clinical experience have shown that inhaled albuterol , like other beta - adrenergic agonist drugs , can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients , as measured by pulse rate , blood pressure , symptoms , and / or electrocardiographic changes [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacokinetics The systemic levels of albuterol are low after inhalation of recommended doses .
A study conducted in 12 healthy male and female subjects using a higher dose ( 1 , 080 mcg of albuterol base ) showed that mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3 ng / mL occurred after dosing when albuterol was delivered using propellant HFA - 134 a .
The mean time to peak concentrations ( Tmax ) was delayed after administration of VENTOLIN HFA ( Tmax = 0 . 42 hours ) as compared to CFC - propelled albuterol inhaler ( Tmax = 0 . 17 hours ) .
Apparent terminal plasma half - life of albuterol is approximately 4 . 6 hours .
No further pharmacokinetic studies for VENTOLIN HFA were conducted in neonates , children , or elderly subjects .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a 2 - year study in Sprague - Dawley rats , albuterol sulfate caused a dose - related increase in the incidence of benign leiomyomas of the mesovarium at and above dietary doses of 2 . 0 mg / kg ( approximately 14 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg / m2 basis and approximately 6 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for children on a mg / m2 basis ) .
In another study this effect was blocked by the coadministration of propranolol , a non - selective beta - adrenergic antagonist .
In an 18 - month study in CD - 1 mice , albuterol sulfate showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at dietary doses of up to 500 mg / kg ( approximately 1 , 700 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg / m2 basis and approximately 800 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for children on a mg / m2 basis ) .
In a 22 - month study in Golden hamsters , albuterol sulfate showed no evidence of tumorigenicity at dietary doses of up to 50 mg / kg ( approximately 225 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg / m2 basis and approximately 110 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for children on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Albuterol sulfate was not mutagenic in the Ames test or a mutation test in yeast .
Albuterol sulfate was not clastogenic in a human peripheral lymphocyte assay or in an AH1 strain mouse micronucleus assay .
Reproduction studies in rats demonstrated no evidence of impaired fertility at oral doses of albuterol sulfate up to 50 mg / kg ( approximately 340 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg / m2 basis ) .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Preclinical : Intravenous studies in rats with albuterol sulfate have demonstrated that albuterol crosses the blood - brain barrier and reaches brain concentrations amounting to approximately 5 . 0 % of the plasma concentrations .
In structures outside the blood - brain barrier ( pineal and pituitary glands ) , albuterol concentrations were found to be 100 times those in the whole brain .
Studies in laboratory animals ( minipigs , rodents , and dogs ) have demonstrated the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death ( with histologic evidence of myocardial necrosis ) when beta - agonists and methylxanthines are administered concurrently .
The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown .
Propellant HFA - 134 a is devoid of pharmacological activity except at very high doses in animals ( 380 to 1 , 300 times the maximum human exposure based on comparisons of AUC values ) , primarily producing ataxia , tremors , dyspnea , or salivation .
These are similar to effects produced by the structurally related CFCs , which have been used extensively in metered - dose inhalers .
In animals and humans , propellant HFA - 134 a was found to be rapidly absorbed and rapidly eliminated , with an elimination half - life of 3 to 27 minutes in animals and 5 to 7 minutes in humans .
Time to maximum plasma concentration ( Tmax ) and mean residence time are both extremely short , leading to a transient appearance of HFA - 134 a in the blood with no evidence of accumulation .
Reproductive Toxicology Studies : A study in CD - 1 mice given albuterol sulfate subcutaneously showed cleft palate formation in 5 of 111 ( 4 . 5 % ) fetuses at 0 . 25 mg / kg ( less than the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg / m2 basis ) and in 10 of 108 ( 9 . 3 % ) fetuses at 2 . 5 mg / kg ( approximately 8 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg / m2 basis ) .
The drug did not induce cleft palate formation at a dose of 0 . 025 mg / kg ( less than the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Cleft palate also occurred in 22 of 72 ( 30 . 5 % ) fetuses from females treated subcutaneously with 2 . 5 mg / kg of isoproterenol ( positive control ) .
A reproduction study in Stride Dutch rabbits revealed cranioschisis in 7 of 19 fetuses ( 37 % ) when albuterol sulfate was administered orally at a 50 mg / kg dose ( approximately 680 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg / m2 basis ) .
In an inhalation reproduction study in New Zealand white rabbits , albuterol sulfate / HFA - 134 a formulation exhibited enlargement of the frontal portion of the fetal fontanelles at and above inhalation doses of 0 . 0193 mg / kg ( less than the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose for adults on a mg / m2 basis ) .
A study in which pregnant rats were dosed with radiolabeled albuterol sulfate demonstrated that drug - related material is transferred from the maternal circulation to the fetus .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Bronchospasm Associated With Asthma Adult and Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age and Older : The efficacy of VENTOLIN HFA was evaluated in two 12 - week , randomized , double - blind , placebo controlled trials in patients 12 years of age and older with mild to moderate asthma .
These trials included a total of 610 patients ( 323 males , 287 females ) .
In each trial , patients received 2 inhalations of VENTOLIN HFA , CFC 11 / 12 - propelled albuterol , or HFA - 134 a placebo 4 times daily for 12 weeks ’ duration .
Patients taking the HFA - 134 a placebo inhaler also took VENTOLIN HFA for asthma symptom relief on an as - needed basis .
Some patients who participated in these clinical trials were using concomitant inhaled steroid therapy .
Efficacy was assessed by serial forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) .
In each of these trials , 2 inhalations of VENTOLIN HFA produced significantly greater improvement in FEV1 over the pretreatment value than placebo .
Results from the 2 clinical trials are described below .
In a 12 - week , randomized , double - blind study , VENTOLIN HFA ( 101 patients ) was compared to CFC 11 / 12 - propelled albuterol ( 99 patients ) and an HFA - 134 a placebo inhaler ( 97 patients ) in adolescent and adult patients 12 to 76 years of age with mild to moderate asthma .
Serial FEV1 measurements [ shown below as percent change from test - day baseline at Day 1 ( n = 297 ) and at Week 12 ( n = 249 ) ] demonstrated that 2 inhalations of VENTOLIN HFA produced significantly greater improvement in FEV1 over the pretreatment value than placebo .
FEV1 as Percent Change From Predose in a Large , 12 - Week Clinical Trial [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] In the responder population ( ≥ 15 % increase in FEV1 within 30 minutes postdose ) treated with VENTOLIN HFA , the mean time to onset of a 15 % increase in FEV1 over the pretreatment value was 5 . 4 minutes , and the mean time to peak effect was 56 minutes .
The mean duration of effect as measured by a 15 % increase in FEV1 over the pretreatment value was approximately 4 hours .
In some patients , duration of effect was as long as 6 hours .
The second 12 - week randomized , double - blind study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of switching patients from CFC 11 / 12 - propelled albuterol to VENTOLIN HFA .
During the 3 - week run - in phase of the study , all patients received CFC 11 / 12 - propelled albuterol .
During the double - blind treatment phase , VENTOLIN HFA ( 91 patients ) was compared to CFC 11 / 12 - propelled albuterol ( 100 patients ) and an HFA - 134 a placebo inhaler ( 95 patients ) in adolescent and adult patients with mild to moderate asthma .
Serial FEV1 measurements demonstrated that 2 inhalations of VENTOLIN HFA produced significantly greater improvement in pulmonary function than placebo .
The switching from CFC 11 / 12 - propelled albuterol inhaler to VENTOLIN HFA did not reveal any clinically significant changes in the efficacy profile .
In the 2 adult studies , the efficacy results from VENTOLIN HFA were significantly greater than placebo and were clinically comparable to those achieved with CFC 11 / 12 - propelled albuterol , although small numerical differences in mean FEV1 response and other measures were observed .
Physicians should recognize that individual responses to beta - adrenergic agonists administered via different propellants may vary and that equivalent responses in individual patients should not be assumed .
Pediatric Patients 4 Years of Age : The efficacy of VENTOLIN HFA was evaluated in one 2 - week , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial in 135 pediatric patients 4 to 11 years of age with mild to moderate asthma .
In this trial , patients received VENTOLIN HFA , CFC 11 / 12 - propelled albuterol , or HFA - 134 a placebo .
Serial pulmonary function measurements demonstrated that 2 inhalations of VENTOLIN HFA produced significantly greater improvement in pulmonary function than placebo and that there were no significant differences between the groups treated with VENTOLIN HFA and CFC 11 / 12 - propelled albuterol .
In the responder population treated with VENTOLIN HFA , the mean time to onset of a 15 % increase in peak expiratory flow rate ( PEFR ) over the pretreatment value was 7 . 8 minutes , and the mean time to peak effect was approximately 90 minutes .
The mean duration of effect as measured by a 15 % increase in PEFR over the pretreatment value was greater than 3 hours .
In some patients , duration of effect was as long as 6 hours .
14 . 2 Exercise - Induced Bronchospasm One controlled clinical study in adult patients with asthma ( N = 24 ) demonstrated that 2 inhalations of VENTOLIN HFA taken approximately 30 minutes prior to exercise significantly prevented exercise - induced bronchospasm ( as measured by maximum percentage fall in FEV1 following exercise ) compared to an HFA - 134 a placebo inhaler .
In addition , VENTOLIN HFA was shown to be clinically comparable to a CFC 11 / 12 - propelled albuterol inhaler for this indication .

Possible side effects of taking VENTOLIN HFA include fast or irregular heartbeat , chest pain , shakiness , and nervousness .
With the first use of a new canister , worsening of wheezing may occur .
The parts of your VENTOLIN HFA inhaler : [ MULTIMEDIA ] There are 2 main parts to your VENTOLIN HFA inhaler — the metal canister that holds the medicine and the blue plastic actuator that sprays the medicine from the canister ( see Figure 1 ) .
The inhaler also has a cap that covers the mouthpiece of the actuator .
The strap on the cap will stay attached to the actuator .
Do not use the actuator with a canister of medicine from any other inhaler .
And do not use a VENTOLIN HFA canister with an actuator from any other inhaler .
The canister has a counter to show how many sprays of medicine you have left .
The number shows through a window in the back of the actuator .
The counter starts at either 204 or at 64 , depending on which size inhaler you have .
The number will count down by 1 each time you spray the inhaler .
The counter will stop counting at 000 .
Never try to change the numbers or take the counter off the metal canister .
The counter cannot be reset , and it is permanently attached to the canister .
How to Use Your VENTOLIN HFA Before using your VENTOLIN HFA : Take the inhaler out of the foil pouch .
