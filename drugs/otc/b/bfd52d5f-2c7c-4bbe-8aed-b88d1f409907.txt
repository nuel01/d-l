6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
A total of 696 HIV - positive patients in three placebo - controlled trials received MYTESI for a mean duration of 78 days .
Of the total population across the three trials , 229 patients received a dosage of 125 mg twice a day for a mean duration of 141 days , and 171 patients received one of four higher than recommended dosages for a mean duration of 139 days ( N = 69 ) 14 days ( N = 102 ) , 146 days ( N = 54 ) , and 14 days ( N = 242 ) , respectively .
Adverse reactions in patients treated with MYTESI 125 mg twice daily that occurred in at least 2 % of patients and at a higher incidence than placebo are provided in Table 1 .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Nelfinavir , Zidovudine , and Lamivudine MYTESI administration did not have a clinically relevant interaction with nelfinavir , zidovudine , or lamivudine in a drug - drug interaction trial [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Women infected with HIV - 1 should be instructed not to breastfeed due to the potential for HIV transmission .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Crofelemer is minimally absorbed systemically by the oral route of administration and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In pregnant rats , no adverse fetal effects were observed with oral administration of crofelemer at doses up to 177 times the recommended clinical dose during the period of organogenesis .
In pregnant rabbits , an increase in fetal resorptions and abortions compared to controls were observed with crofelemer at a dose of 96 times the recommended clinical dose .
However , it is not clear whether these effects in rabbits are related to the maternal toxicity ( decreased body weight and decreased food consumption ) observed at this dose ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Crofelemer was not teratogenic and did not produce embryofetal toxicity in pregnant rats following oral administration at doses up to 738 mg / kg / day during the period of organogenesis .
The 738 mg / kg / day dose is 177 times the recommended daily human dose of 4 . 2 mg / kg / day .
Crofelemer was not teratogenic in pregnant rabbits following oral administration at doses up to 400 mg / kg / day during the period of organogenesis .
At a dose level of 400 mg / kg / day , which is 96 times the recommended daily human dose of 4 . 2 mg / kg / day , crofelemer produced an increase in fetal resorptions and abortions compared to controls .
However , it is not clear whether these effects are related to the maternal toxicity ( decreased body weight and decreased food consumption ) observed .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV - 1 infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV - 1 .
There are no data on the presence of crofelemer in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for HIV transmission and adverse effects on a breastfed infant , instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are taking MYTESI .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of MYTESI have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies with MYTESI did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients .
8 . 6 Use in Patients with Low CD4 Counts and High Viral Loads No dose modifications are recommended with respect to CD4 cell count and HIV viral load , based on the findings in subgroups of patients defined by CD4 cell count and HIV viral load .
The safety profile of MYTESI was similar in patients with baseline CD4 cell count less than 404 cells / microL ( lower limit of normal range ) ( N = 388 ) and patients with baseline CD4 cell counts greater than or equal to 404 cells / microL ( N = 289 ) .
The safety profile of crofelemer was similar in patients with baseline HIV viral loads less than 400 copies / mL ( N = 412 ) and patients with baseline HIV viral loads greater than or equal to 400 copies / mL ( N = 278 ) .
11 DESCRIPTION MYTESI ( crofelemer ) delayed - release tablets is an anti - diarrheal , enteric - coated drug product for oral administration .
It contains 125 mg of crofelemer , a botanical drug substance that is derived from the red latex of Croton lechleri Müll .
Arg .
Crofelemer is an oligomeric proanthocyanidin mixture primarily composed of ( + ) – catechin , ( – ) – epicatechin , ( + ) – gallocatechin , and ( – ) – epigallocatechin monomer units linked in random sequence , as represented below .
The average degree of polymerization for the oligomers ranges between 5 and 7 . 5 , as determined by phloroglucinol degradation .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] R = H or OH range n = 3 to 5 . 5 Inactive ingredients : colloidal silicon dioxide , croscarmellose sodium , magnesium stearate , and microcrystalline cellulose .
Coating ingredients : ethylacrylate and methylacrylate copolymer dispersion , talc , triethyl citrate , and white dispersion which contains xanthan gum , titanium dioxide , propyl paraben , and methyl paraben .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Crofelemer is an inhibitor of both the cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) - stimulated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) chloride ion ( Cl ¯ ) channel , and the calcium - activated Cl ¯ channels ( CaCC ) at the luminal membrane of enterocytes .
The CFTR Cl ¯ channel and CaCC regulate Cl ¯ and fluid secretion by intestinal epithelial cells .
Crofelemer acts by blocking Cl ¯ secretion and accompanying high volume water loss in diarrhea , normalizing the flow of Cl ¯ and water in the gastrointestinal tract .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Consistent with the mechanism of action of crofelemer ( i . e . , inhibition of CFTR and CaCC in the gastrointestinal lumen ) , data suggest stool chloride concentrations decreased in patients treated with crofelemer 500 mg four times daily ( 8 - times the recommended daily dosage ) ( n = 25 ) for four days relative to placebo ( n = 24 ) ; stool chloride concentrations decreased in both African American patients treated with crofelemer ( n = 3 ) relative to placebo ( n = 5 ) and non - African American patients treated with Mytesi ( n = 22 ) relative to placebo ( n = 19 ) .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 10 times the maximum recommended dose , crofelemer does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The absorption of crofelemer is minimal following oral dosing in healthy adults and HIV – positive patients and concentrations of crofelemer in plasma are below the level of quantitation ( 50 ng / mL ) .
Therefore , standard pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the curve , maximum concentration , and half - life cannot be estimated .
Effect of Food Administration of crofelemer with a high - fat meal was not associated with an increase in systemic exposure of crofelemer in healthy subjects .
In the clinical trial , a single 500 mg dose of crofelemer ( 4 - times the recommended dose ) was administered one - half hour before the morning and evening meals [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies have shown that crofelemer has the potential to inhibit transporters MRP2 and OATP1A2 but not P - gp and BCRP at concentrations expected in the gut .
Due to the minimal absorption of crofelemer , crofelemer is unlikely to inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A2 , 2A6 , 2B6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , and 2E1 systemically .
Nelfinavir , Zidovudine , Lamivudine Results of a crossover study in healthy subjects showed crofelemer 500 mg administered four times daily ( 8 - times the recommended daily dosage ) for five days had no effect on the exposure of zidovudine and nelfinavir when administered as a single dose .
A 20 % decrease in lamivudine exposure was also observed in the same study but was not considered to be clinically important .
Midazolam In vitro studies have shown that crofelemer has the potential to inhibit CYP3A4 enzymes at concentrations expected in the gut .
The effects of crofelemer on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of 2 mg midazolam , a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate , was evaluated in healthy subjects following crofelemer dosed orally at 500 mg twice daily ( 4 - times the recommended dosage ) for six consecutive days .
No significant changes in the mean Cmax and AUC were observed for midazolam and its active metabolite , hydroxymidazolam after co - administration with crofelemer compared to that after administration of midazolam alone .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a 6 - month carcinogenicity study in Tg . rasH2 transgenic mice , crofelemer at oral doses up to 125 mg / kg twice a day ( 250 mg / kg / day ) did not produce any drug - related neoplasms in male and female animals .
The 250 mg / kg / day dose is about 60 times the recommended clinical dose of 4 . 2 mg / kg / day ( 125 mg twice daily ) .
In a 2 - year oral carcinogenicity study in rats , crofelemer at doses up to 100 / 50 mg / kg twice a day ( 200 / 100 mg / kg / day ) , which is 47 . 6 / 23 . 8 times the recommended clinical dose , did not produce any drug - related neoplastic findings in male and female rats ( due to drug - related decreased survival in male rats , 37 . 5 mg / kg twice daily and 100 mg / kg twice daily doses were reduced to 25 mg / kg twice daily and 50 mg / kg twice daily , respectively , at week 67 ) .
Mutagenesis Crofelemer was negative in the bacterial reverse mutation assay , chromosomal aberration assay , and rat bone marrow micronucleus assay .
Impairment of Fertility Crofelemer , at oral doses of up to 738 mg / kg / day ( 177 times the recommended human daily dose of 125 mg twice daily ) , had no effects on fertility or reproductive performance of male and female rats .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of MYTESI was evaluated in a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled ( one month ) and placebo - free ( five month ) , multi - center study .
The study enrolled 374 HIV - positive patients on stable anti - retroviral therapy with a history of diarrhea for one month or more .
Diarrhea was defined as either persistently loose stools despite regular use of anti - diarrheal medication ( e . g . , loperamide , diphenoxylate , and bismuth subsalicylate ) or one or more watery bowel movements per day without regular anti - diarrheal medicine use .
Patients were excluded if they had a positive gastrointestinal biopsy , gastrointestinal culture , or stool test for multiple bacteria ( Salmonella , Shigella , Campylobacter , Yersinia , Mycobacterium ) , bacterial toxin ( Clostridium difficile ) , ova and parasites ( Giardia , Entamoeba , Isospora , Cyclospora , Cryptosporidium , Microsporidium ) , or viruses ( Cytomegalovirus ) .
Patients were also excluded if they had a history of ulcerative colitis , Crohn ’ s disease , celiac sprue ( gluten - enteropathy ) , chronic pancreatitis , malabsorption , or any other gastrointestinal disease associated with diarrhea .
The study had a two - stage adaptive design .
In both stages , patients received placebo for 10 days ( screening period ) followed by randomization to crofelemer or placebo for 31 days of treatment ( double - blind period ) .
Only patients with 1 or more watery bowel movements per day on at least 5 of the last 7 days in the screening period were randomized to the double - blind period .
Each stage enrolled patients separately ; the dose for the second stage was selected based on an interim analysis of data from the first stage .
In the first stage , patients were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 to one of three crofelemer dosage regimens ( 125 mg twice daily , or one of two higher dosage regimens ) or placebo .
In the second stage , patients were randomized 1 : 1 to MYTESI 125 mg twice daily or placebo .
The efficacy analysis was based on results from the double - blind portion of both stages .
Each study stage also had a five month period ( placebo - free period ) that followed the double - blind period .
Patients treated with MYTESI continued the same dose in the placebo - free period .
In the first stage , patients that received placebo were re - randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to one of the three crofelemer dosage regimens ( 125 mg twice daily , or one of the two higher dosage regimens ) in the placebo - free period .
In the second stage , patients that received placebo were treated with MYTESI 125 mg twice daily in the placebo - free period .
The median time since diagnosis of HIV was 12 years .
The percentage of patients with a CD4 cell count of less than 404 was 39 % .
The percentage of patients with a HIV viral load greater than or equal to 1000 , 400 to 999 , and less than 400 HIV copies / mL was 7 % , 3 % , and 9 % , respectively ; the remainder had a viral load that was not detectable .
The median time since diarrhea started was 4 years .
The median number of daily watery bowel movements was 2 . 5 per day .
Most patients were male ( 85 % ) .
The percentage of patients that were Caucasian was 46 % ; the percentage of patients that were African - American was 32 % .
The median age was 45 years with a range of 21 to 68 years .
In the double - blind period of the study , 136 patients received MYTESI 125 mg twice daily , 101 patients received one of the two higher dosage regimens and 138 patients received placebo .
The percentages of patients that completed the double - blind period were 92 % in the MYTESI 125 mg group and 94 % in the placebo arm .
Most patients received concomitant protease inhibitors during the double - blind period ( Table 2 ) .
The most frequently used anti - retroviral therapies in the MYTESI 125 mg and placebo groups were tenofovir / emtricitabine , ritonavir , and lopinavir / ritonavir .

Patients who received concomitant anti - diarrheal medications or opiates were counted as clinical non - responders .
A significantly larger proportion of patients in the MYTESI 125 mg twice daily group experienced clinical response compared with patients in the placebo group ( 18 % vs . 8 % , 1 – sided p < 0 . 01 ) .
In the randomized clinical study , examination of duration of diarrhea , baseline number of daily watery bowel movements , use of protease inhibitors , CD4 cell count and age subgroups did not identify differences in the consistency of the crofelemer treatment effect among these subgroups .
There were too few female patients and patients with an HIV viral load > 400 copies / mL to adequately assess differences in effects in these populations .
Among race subgroups , there were no differences in the consistency of the crofelemer treatment effect except for the subgroup of African - Americans ; crofelemer was less effective in African - Americans than non - African - Americans .
Although the CD4 cell count and HIV viral load did not appear to change over the one month placebo - controlled period , the clinical significance of this finding is unknown because of the short duration of the placebo - controlled period .
Of the 24 clinical responders to MYTESI 125 mg twice daily , 22 entered the placebo - free period ; 16 were responding at the end of month 3 , and 14 were responding at the end of month 5 .
