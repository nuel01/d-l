( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypotension / bradycardia / syncope : Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients at risk for hypotension , heart block , bradycardia , syncope , cardiovascular disease , vascular disease , cerebrovascular disease or chronic renal failure .
Measure heart rate andblood pressure prior to initiation of therapy , following dose increases , and periodically while on therapy .
Avoid concomitant use of drugs with additive effects unless clinically indicated .
Advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated .
( 5 . 1 ) • Somnolence / Sedation : Has been observed with clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
Consider the potential for additive sedative effects with CNS depressant drugs .
Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
( 5 . 2 ) • Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities : May worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular ( AV ) block , especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs .
Titrate slowly and monitor vital signs frequently .
( 5 . 5 ) 5 . 1 Hypotension / Bradycardia Treatment with clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets can cause dose - related decreases in blood pressure and heart rate [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Measure heart rate and blood pressure prior to initiation of therapy , following dose increases , and periodically while on therapy .
Titrate clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets slowly in patients with a history of hypotension , and those with underlying conditions that may be worsened by hypotension and bradycardia ; e . g . , heart block , bradycardia , cardiovascular disease , vascular disease , cerebrovascular disease , or chronic renal failure .
In patients who have a history of syncope or may have a condition that predisposes them to syncope , such as hypotension , orthostatic hypotension , bradycardia , or dehydration , advise patients to avoid becoming dehydrated or overheated .
Monitor blood pressure and heart rate , and adjust dosages accordingly in patients treated concomitantly with antihypertensives or other drugs that can reduce blood pressure or heart rate or increase the risk of syncope .
5 . 2 Sedation and Somnolence Somnolence and sedation were commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical studies .
In patients that completed 5 weeks of therapy in a controlled , fixed dose pediatric monotherapy study , 31 % of patients treated with 0 . 4 mg / day and 38 % treated with 0 . 2 mg / day versus 4 % of placebo treated patients reported somnolence as an adverse event .
In patients that completed 5 weeks of therapy in a controlled flexible dose pediatric adjunctive to stimulants study , 19 % of patients treated with clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets + stimulant versus 7 % treated with placebo + stimulant reported somnolence .
Before using clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets with other centrally active depressants ( such as phenothiazines , barbiturates , or benzodiazepines ) , consider the potential for additive sedative effects .
Caution patients against operating heavy equipment or driving until they know how they respond to treatment with clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
Advise patients to avoid use with alcohol .
5 . 3 Rebound Hypertension Abrupt discontinuation of clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets can cause rebound hypertension .
In adults with hypertension , sudden cessation of clonidine hydrochloride extended - release formulation treatment in the 0 . 2 to 0 . 6 mg / day range resulted in reports of headache , tachycardia , nausea , flushing , warm feeling , brief lightheadedness , tightness in chest , and anxiety .
In adults with hypertension , sudden cessation of treatment with immediate - release clonidine has , in some cases , resulted in symptoms such as nervousness , agitation , headache , and tremor accompanied or followed by a rapid rise in blood pressure and elevated catecholamine concentrations in the plasma .
No studies evaluating abrupt discontinuation of clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets in children with ADHD have been conducted ; however , to minimize the risk of rebound hypertension , gradually reduce the dose of clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets in decrements of no more than 0 . 1 mg every 3 to 7 days .
Patients should be instructed not to discontinue clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets therapy without consulting their physician due to the potential risk of withdrawal effects .
5 . 4 Allergic Reactions In patients who have developed localized contact sensitization to clonidine transdermal system , continuation of clonidine transdermal system or substitution of oral clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets therapy may be associated with the development of a generalized skin rash .
In patients who develop an allergic reaction from clonidine transdermal system , substitution of oral clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets may also elicit an allergic reaction ( including generalized rash , urticaria , or angioedema ) .
5 . 5 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities The sympatholytic action of clonidine may worsen sinus node dysfunction and atrioventricular ( AV ) block , especially in patients taking other sympatholytic drugs .
There have been post - marketing reports of patients with conduction abnormalities and / or taking other sympatholytic drugs who developed severe bradycardia requiring IV atropine , IV isoproterenol , and temporary cardiac pacing while taking clonidine .
Titrate clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets slowly and monitor vital signs frequently in patients with cardiac conduction abnormalities or patients concomitantly treated with other sympatholytic drugs .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
These events exclude those already mentioned in 6 . 1 : Psychiatric : hallucinations Cardiovascular : Q - T prolongation 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The following have been reported with other oral immediate release formulations of clonidine : Table 6 Clinically Important Drug InteractionsConcomitant Drug Name or Drug Class Clinical Rationale Clinical Recommendation Tricyclic antidepressants Increase blood pressure and may counteract clonidine ’ s hypotensive effects Monitor blood pressure and adjust as needed Antihypertensive drugs Potentiate clonidine ’ s hypotensive effects Monitor blood pressure and adjust as needed CNS depressants Potentiate sedating effects Avoid use Drugs that affect sinus node function or AV node conduction ( e . g . , digitalis , calcium channel blockers , beta blockers ) Potentiate bradycardia and risk of AV block Avoid use • Sedating Drugs : Clonidine may potentiate the CNS - depressive effects of alcohol , barbiturates or other sedating drugs .
( 7 ) • Tricyclic Antidepressants : May reduce the hypotensive effect of clonidine .
( 7 ) • Drugs Known to Affect Sinus Node Function or AV Nodal Conduction : Caution is warranted in patients receiving clonidine concomitantly with agents known to affect sinus node function or AV nodal conduction ( e . g . , digitalis , calcium channel blockers and beta - blockers ) due to a potential for additive effects such as bradycardia and AV block .
( 7 ) • Antihypertensive drugs : Use caution when coadministered with c lonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Based on animal data , clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets may cause fetal harm .
( 8 . 1 ) • Renal Impairment : The dosage of clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets must be adjusted according to the degree of impairment , and patients should be carefully monitored .
( 8 . 6 , 12 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C : Risk Summary There are no adequate or well - controlled studies with clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets in pregnant women .
In animal embryofetal studies , increased resorptions were seen in rats and mice administered oral clonidine hydrochloride from implantation through organogenesis at 10 and 5 times , respectively , the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) .
No embryotoxic or teratogenic effects were seen in rabbits administered oral clonidine hydrochloride during organogenesis at doses up to 3 times the MRHD .
Clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Animal Data Oral administration of clonidine hydrochloride to pregnant rabbits during the period of embryo / fetal organogenesis at doses of up to 80 mcg / kg / day ( approximately 3 times the oral maximum recommended daily dose [ MRHD ] of 0 . 4 mg / day on a mg / m 2 basis ) produced no evidence of teratogenic or embryotoxic potential .
In pregnant rats , however , doses as low as 15 mcg / kg / day ( 1 / 3 the MRHD on a mg / m 2 basis ) were associated with increased resorptions in a study in which dams were treated continuously from 2 months prior to mating and throughout gestation .
Increased resorptions were not associated with treatment at the same or at higher dose levels ( up to 3 times the MRHD ) when treatment of the dams was restricted to gestation days 6 to 15 .
Increases in resorptions were observed in both rats and mice at 500 mcg / kg / day ( 10 and 5 times the MRHD in rats and mice , respectively ) or higher when the animals were treated on gestation days 1 to 14 ; 500 mcg / kg / day was the lowest dose employed in this study .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Clonidine hydrochloride is present in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition .
Exercise caution when clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets are administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets in the treatment of ADHD have been established in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age .
Use of clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age is supported by a short - term , placebo - controlled monotherapy trial and a short - term adjunctive therapy trial [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years has not been established .
Additional pediatric use information for patients ages 6 to 17 years is approved for Concordia Pharmaceuticals Inc . ’ s KAPVAY ( clonidine hydrochloride ) extended - release tablets .
However , due to Concordia Pharmaceuticals Inc . ’ s marketing exclusivity rights , this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information .
Juvenile Animal Data A study was conducted in which young rats were treated orally with clonidine hydrochloride from day 21 of age to adulthood at doses of up to 300 mcg / kg / day , which is approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 0 . 4 mg / day on a mg / m 2 basis .
A slight delay in onset of preputial separation ( delayed sexual maturation ) was seen in males treated with the highest dose ( with a no - effect dose of 100 mcg / kg / day , which is approximately equal to the MRHD ) , but there were no drug effects on fertility or on other measures of sexual or neurobehavioral development .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment The impact of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of clonidine in children has not been assessed .
The initial dosage of clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be based on degree of impairment .
Monitor patients carefully for hypotension and bradycardia , and titrate to higher doses cautiously .
Since only a minimal amount of clonidine is removed during routine hemodialysis , there is no need to give supplemental clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets following dialysis .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9 . 1 Controlled Substance Clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets are not a controlled substance and have no known potential for abuse or dependence .
10 OVERDOSAGE Symptoms Clonidine overdose : hypertension may develop early and may be followed by hypotension , bradycardia , respiratory depression , hypothermia , drowsiness , decreased or absent reflexes , weakness , irritability and miosis .
The frequency of CNS depression may be higher in children than adults .
Large overdoses may result in reversible cardiac conduction defects or dysrhythmias , apnea , coma and seizures .
Signs and symptoms of overdose generally occur within 30 minutes to two hours after exposure .
Treatment Consult with a Certified Poison Control Center ( 1 - 800 - 222 - 1222 ) for up - to - date guidance and advice .
11 DESCRIPTION Clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets are a centrally acting alpha 2 - adrenergic agonist available as 0 . 1 mg extended - release tablets for oral administration .
Each 0 . 1 mg tablet is equivalent to 0 . 087 mg of the free base .
The inactive ingredients are sodium lauryl sulfate , lactose monohydrate , hypromellose type 2208 , partially pregelatinized starch , colloidal silicon dioxide , and magnesium stearate .
The formulation is designed to delay the absorption of active drug in order to decrease peak to trough plasma concentration differences .
Clonidine hydrochloride , USP is an imidazoline derivative and exists as a mesomeric compound .
The chemical name is 2 - ( 2 , 6 - dichlorophenylamino ) - 2 - imidazoline hydrochloride .
The following is the structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] C 9 H 9 Cl 2 N 3 • HCl Mol .
Wt .
266 . 56 Clonidine hydrochloride , USP is an odorless , bitter , white , crystalline substance soluble in water and alcohol .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Clonidine stimulates alpha 2 - adrenergic receptors in the brain .
Clonidine is not a central nervous system stimulant .
The mechanism of action of clonidine in ADHD is not known .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Clonidine is a known antihypertensive agent .
By stimulating alpha 2 - adrenergic receptors in the brain stem , clonidine reduces sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system and decreases peripheral resistance , renal vascular resistance , heart rate , and blood pressure .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Single - dose Pharmacokinetics in Adults Immediate - release clonidine hydrochloride and clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets have different pharmacokinetic characteristics ; dose substitution on a milligram for milligram basis will result in differences in exposure .
A comparison across studies suggests that the C max is 50 % lower for clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets compared to immediate - release clonidine hydrochloride .
Following oral administration of an immediate release formulation , plasma clonidine concentration peaks in approximately 3 to 5 hours and the plasma half - life ranges from 12 to 16 hours .
The half - life increases up to 41 hours in patients with severe impairment of renal function .
Following oral administration about 40 - 60 % of the absorbed dose is recovered in the urine as unchanged drug in 24 hours .
About 50 % of the absorbed dose is metabolized in the liver .
Although studies of the effect of renal impairment and studies of clonidine excretion have not been performed with clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets , results are likely to be similar to those of the immediate release formulation .
The pharmacokinetic profile of clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets administration was evaluated in an open - label , three - period , randomized , crossover study of 15 healthy adult subjects who received three single - dose regimens of clonidine : 0 . 1 mg of clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets under fasted conditions , 0 . 1 mg of clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets following a high fat meal , and 0 . 1 mg of clonidine immediate - release ( Catapres ® ) under fasted conditions .
Treatments were separated by one - week washout periods .
Mean concentration - time data from the 3 treatments are shown in Table 7 and Figure 1 .
After administration of clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets , maximum clonidine concentrations were approximately 50 % of the Catapres maximum concentrations and occurred approximately 5 hours later relative to Catapres .
Similar elimination half - lives were observed and total systemic bioavailability following clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets was approximately 89 % of that following Catapres .
Food had no effect on plasma concentrations , bioavailability , or elimination half - life .

Body weight normalized clearance ( CL / F ) in children and adolescents was higher than CL / F observed in adults with hypertension .
Clonidine concentrations in plasma increased with increases in dose over the dose range of 0 . 2 to 0 . 4 mg / day .
Clonidine CL / F was independent of dose administered over the 0 . 2 to 0 . 4 mg / day dose range .
Clonidine CL / F appeared to decrease slightly with increases in age over the range of 6 to 17 years , and females had a 23 % lower CL / F than males .
The incidence of " sedation - like " AEs ( somnolence and fatigue ) appeared to be independent of clonidine dose or concentration within the studied dose range in the titration study .
Results from the add - on study showed that clonidine CL / F was 11 % higher in patients who were receiving methylphenidate and 44 % lower in those receiving amphetamine compared to subjects not on adjunctive therapy .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Clonidine hydrochloride was not carcinogenic when administered in the diet of rats ( for up to 132 weeks ) or mice ( for up to 78 weeks ) at doses of up to 1620 ( male rats ) , 2040 ( female rats ) , or 2500 ( mice ) mcg / kg / day .
These doses are approximately 20 , 25 , and 15 times , respectively , the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 0 . 4 mg / day on a mg / m 2 basis .
There was no evidence of genotoxicity in the Ames test for mutagenicity or mouse micronucleus test for clastogenicity .

14 CLINICAL STUDIES Efficacy of clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets in the treatment of ADHD was established in children and adolescents ( 6 to 17 years ) in : • One short - term , placebo - controlled monotherapy trial ( Study 1 ) • One short - term adjunctive therapy to psychostimulants trial ( Study 2 ) Short - term Monotherapy and Adjunctive Therapy to Psychostimulant Studies for ADHD The efficacy of clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets in the treatment of ADHD was established in 2 ( one monotherapy and one adjunctive therapy ) placebo - controlled trials in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 , who met DSM - IV criteria of ADHD hyperactive or combined hyperactive / inattentive subtypes .
Signs and symptoms of ADHD were evaluated using the investigator administered and scored ADHD Rating Scale - IV - Parent Version ( ADHDRS - IV ) total score including hyperactive / impulsivity and inattentive subscales .
Study 1 ( CLON - 301 ) , was an 8 - week randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , fixed dose study of children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 ( N = 236 ) with a 5 - week primary efficacy endpoint .
Patients were randomly assigned to one of the following three treatment groups : clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets ( CLON ) 0 . 2 mg / day ( N = 78 ) , clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets 0 . 4 mg / day ( N = 80 ) , or placebo ( N = 78 ) .
Dosing for the clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets groups started at 0 . 1 mg / day and was titrated in increments of 0 . 1 mg / week to their respective dose ( as divided doses ) .
Patients were maintained at their dose for a minimum of 2 weeks before being gradually tapered down to 0 . 1 mg / day at the last week of treatment .
At both doses , improvements in ADHD symptoms were statistically significantly superior in clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets - treated patients compared with placebo - treated patients at the end of 5 weeks as measured by the ADHDRS - IV total score ( Table 8 ) .
Study 2 ( CLON - 302 ) was an 8 - week randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , flexible dose study in children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 ( N = 198 ) with a 5 - week primary efficacy end point .
Patients had been treated with a psychostimulant ( methylphenidate or amphetamine ) for four weeks with inadequate response .
Patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups : clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets adjunct to a psychostimulant ( N = 102 ) or psychostimulant alone ( N = 96 ) .
The clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablet dose was initiated at 0 . 1 mg / day and doses were titrated in increments of 0 . 1 mg / week up to 0 . 4 mg / day , as divided doses , over a 3 - week period based on tolerability and clinical response .
The dose was maintained for a minimum of 2 weeks before being gradually tapered to 0 . 1 mg / day at the last week of treatment .
ADHD symptoms were statistically significantly improved in clonidine hydrochloride extended - release tablets plus stimulant group compared with the stimulant alone group at the end of 5 weeks as measured by the ADHDRS - IV total score ( Table 8 ) .
