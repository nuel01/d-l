The reactions , which have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness , frequency of reporting , possible causal connection to MIOSTAT , or a combination of these factors , include : corneal edema , drug effect prolonged ( miosis ) , eye inflammation , eye pain , intraocular pressure increased , ocular hyperemia , vision blurred , visual impairment , and vomiting .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : Aseptically remove the sterile vial from the blister package by peeling the backing paper and dropping the vial onto a sterile tray .
Withdraw the contents into a dry sterile syringe , and replace the needle with an atraumatic cannula prior to intraocular instillation .
