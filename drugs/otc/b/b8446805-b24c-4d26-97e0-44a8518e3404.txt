6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety of ADBRY was evaluated in a pool of 5 randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials in subjects with moderate - to - severe atopic dermatitis including three phase 3 Eczema Tralokinumab trials ( ECZTRA 1 , ECZTRA 2 , and ECZTRA 3 ) , a dose - finding trial , and a vaccine response trial .
The safety population had a mean age of 37 years ; 43 % of subjects were female , 67 % were White , 21 % were Asian , and 9 % were Black .
In terms of co - morbid conditions , 39 % of the subjects had asthma , 49 % had hay fever , 36 % had food allergy , and 21 % had allergic conjunctivitis at baseline .
In these 5 atopic dermatitis trials , 1964 subjects were treated with subcutaneous injections of ADBRY , with or without concomitant topical corticosteroids ( TCS ) .
A total of 807 subjects were treated with ADBRY for at least 1 year .
ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2 compared the safety of ADBRY monotherapy to placebo through Week 52 .
ECZTRA 3 compared the safety of ADBRY + TCS to placebo + TCS through Week 32 .
Weeks 0 to 16 ( ECZTRA 1 , ECZTRA 2 , and ECZTRA 3 ) : Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions identified in the pool of 3 trials ( ECZTRA 1 , ECZTRA 2 , and ECZTRA 3 ) and that occurred at a rate of at least 1 % in the ADBRY 300 mg every other week monotherapy group , and in the ADBRY 300 mg every other week + TCS study , all at a higher rate than placebo during the first 16 weeks of treatment .
Table 1 : Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥ 1 % of the ADBRY Monotherapy Group or the ADBRY + TCS Group in the Atopic Dermatitis Trials through Week 16 Adverse Reaction ADBRY Monotherapy [ 1 ] ADBRY + TCS [ 2 ] ADBRY 300 mg Q2W [ 3 ] N = 1180 n ( % ) PLACEBO N = 388 n ( % ) ADBRY 300 mg Q2W null + TCS N = 243 n ( % ) PLACEBO + TCS N = 123 n ( % ) Upper respiratory tract infections [ 4 ] 281 ( 23 . 8 ) 79 ( 20 . 4 ) 73 ( 30 . 0 ) 19 ( 15 . 4 ) Conjunctivitis [ 5 ] 88 ( 7 . 5 ) 12 ( 3 . 1 ) 33 ( 13 . 6 ) 6 ( 4 . 9 ) Injection site reactions [ 6 ] 87 ( 7 . 4 ) 16 ( 4 . 1 ) 27 ( 11 . 1 ) 1 ( 0 . 8 ) Eosinophilia [ 7 ] 17 ( 1 . 4 ) 2 ( 0 . 5 ) 3 ( 1 . 2 ) 0 [ 1 ] Pooled analysis of ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2 .
[ 2 ] Analysis of ECZTRA 3 where subjects were on background TCS therapy .
[ 3 ] ADBRY 600 mg at Week 0 , followed by 300 mg every other week .
[ 4 ] Upper respiratory tract infections cluster includes upper respiratory tract infection , viral upper respiratory tract infection , pharyngitis , and nasopharyngitis ; mainly reported as common cold .
[ 5 ] Conjunctivitis cluster includes conjunctivitis and allergic conjunctivitis .
[ 6 ] Injection site reactions cluster includes pain , erythema , and swelling .
[ 7 ] Eosinophilia cluster includes eosinophilia and eosinophil count increased .
In the monotherapy trials ( ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2 ) through Week 16 , the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 0 . 7 % in the ADBRY 300 mg every other week group and 0 % of the placebo group .
In the concomitant TCS trial ( ECZTRA 3 ) through Week 16 , the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 0 . 8 % in the ADBRY 300 mg every other week + TCS group and 0 % of the placebo + TCS group .
The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in the ADBRY group compared to the placebo group were injection site reaction ( 0 . 3 % v . 0 ) and eosinophilia ( 0 . 3 % v . 0 ) in ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2 ; and injection site reaction ( 0 . 4 % v . 0 ) and conjunctivitis ( 0 . 4 % v . 0 ) in ECZTRA 3 .
Safety Weeks 16 - 52 ( ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2 ) and Weeks 16 - 32 ( ECZTRA 3 ) : The safety profile of ADBRY 300 mg every other week with or without TCS during maintenance treatment was consistent with that in the initial 16 - week treatment period .
In addition , the frequency of adverse reactions with ADBRY 300 mg every other week and every 4 weeks in ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2 was 44 % and 34 % , respectively , and 43 % and 26 % with ADBRY 300 mg + TCS every other week and every 4 weeks in ECZTRA 3 , respectively .
Specific Adverse Reactions Conjunctivitis and Keratitis Conjunctivitis , including allergic conjunctivitis , was reported in 7 . 5 % of subjects treated with ADBRY 300 mg every other week ( 29 events per 100 subject - years of exposure ) and in 3 . 1 % of subjects treated with placebo ( 12 events per 100 subject - years of exposure ) in the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the pool of 5 trials .
In the ADBRY group , 126 subjects reported 145 events of conjunctivitis , with 114 events resolved at the end of initial treatment period .
Conjunctivitis led to discontinuation of treatment in 2 subjects .
During the maintenance treatment period of the monotherapy trials ( ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2 ) from 16 to 52 weeks , conjunctivitis was reported in 8 . 9 % of subjects treated with ADBRY 300 mg every other week ( 20 events per 100 subject - years of exposure ) and in 6 . 3 % of subjects treated with ADBRY 300 mg every 4 weeks ( 14 events per 100 subject - years of exposure ) compared to 7 . 7 % of subjects treated with ADBRY 300 mg every other week in the initial treatment period ( 30 events per 100 subject - years of exposure ) .
Conjunctivitis ( including no serious events , 1 severe event , and 1 event that led to discontinuation ) was reported in 24 subjects in the combined ( every other week and every 4 weeks ) ADBRY groups .
A similar pattern was seen during the continuation treatment period of an additional 16 weeks in the ADBRY combination ECZTRA 3 .
Keratitis ( including keratoconjunctivitis ) was reported in 0 . 5 % of subjects treated with ADBRY and 0 % treated with placebo during the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks in the pool of 5 trials .
Keratitis ( including 1 ulcerative keratitis ) was reported in 0 . 2 % of subjects treated with ADBRY ( 0 . 9 events per 100 subject - years of exposure ) and 0 . 2 % of subjects treated with placebo ( 0 . 6 events per 100 subject - years of exposure ) .
Keratoconjunctivitis ( including 1 atopic keratoconjunctivitis ) was reported in 0 . 3 % of subjects treated with ADBRY ( 1 . 2 events per 100 subject - years of exposure ) , and in no subjects treated with placebo .
In the ADBRY group , 9 subjects reported 10 events of keratitis or keratoconjunctivitis , with 5 events resolved during the trial following the initial treatment period .
None of the events were serious or led to treatment discontinuation .
During the maintenance treatment period of the monotherapy trials ( ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2 ) from 16 to 52 weeks in the ADBRY 300 mg every other week group , keratitis was reported in 1 ( 0 . 6 % ) subject ( ulcerative , severe , resolved after discontinuation ) at an exposure - adjusted event rate of 1 . 2 per 100 subject - years , and keratoconjunctivitis ( not serious or severe , resolved , not led to discontinuation ) was reported in 3 ( 1 . 9 % ) subjects ( 3 . 6 events per 100 subject - years of exposure ) .
No events of keratitis or keratoconjunctivitis was reported in ADBRY every 4 weeks or placebo groups , compared to keratitis event rate of 2 per 100 subject - years for ADBRY 300 mg every other week in the initial treatment period .
In the continuation treatment period of ECZTRA 3 ( from 16 to 32 weeks ) , there were no additional events of keratitis reported for subjects randomized to ADBRY 300 mg + TCS .
Eosinophil Counts ADBRY - treated subjects had a greater mean initial increase from baseline in eosinophil count compared to subjects treated with placebo .
The mean and median increases in blood eosinophils from baseline to Week 4 were 190 and 100 cells / mcL , respectively .
The increase in the ADBRY - treated subjects declined to baseline level with continued treatment .
Eosinophilia ( > 5000 cells / mcL ) in the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks was reported in 1 . 2 % in the ADBRY - treated subjects and 0 . 3 % in the placebo - treated subjects .
The safety profile for subjects with eosinophilia was comparable to the safety profile for all subjects included in the pool of 5 atopic dermatitis trials .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is a potential for immunogenicity with ADBRY .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors , including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other tralokinumab products may be misleading .
In ECZTRA 1 , ECZTRA 2 , and ECZTRA 3 , and the vaccine - response trial , the incidence of Anti - Drug - Antibodies ( ADA ) during the initial 16 - week treatment period was 1 . 4 % for subjects treated with ADBRY 300 mg every other week and in 1 . 3 % for subjects treated with placebo ; neutralizing antibodies were seen in 0 . 1 % of subjects treated with ADBRY and 0 . 2 % of subjects treated with placebo .
Across all trial periods , the ADA incidence for subjects who received ADBRY was 4 . 6 % ; 0 . 9 % had persistent ADA and 1 . 0 % had neutralizing antibodies .
No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics , safety , or efficacy of tralokinumab - ldrm were observed in patients who tested positive for anti - tralokinumab - ldrm antibody ( including neutralizing antibodies ) .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to ADBRY during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register pregnant patients , or pregnant women may enroll themselves in the registry by calling 1 - 877 - 311 - 8972 or visiting https : / / mothertobaby . org / ongoing - study / adbry - tralokinumab / .
Risk Summary There are limited data from the use of ADBRY in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes .
Human IgG antibodies are known to cross the placental barrier ; therefore , ADBRY may be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus .
In an enhanced pre - and post - natal developmental study , no adverse developmental effects were observed in offspring born to pregnant monkeys after intravenous administration of tralokinumab - ldrm during organogenesis through parturition at doses up to 10 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In a pre - and post - natal development study , intravenous doses up to 100 mg / kg tralokinumab - ldrm were administered to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys once every week from gestation day 20 to parturition .
No maternal or developmental toxicity was observed at doses up to 100 mg / kg / week ( 10 times the MRHD on a mg / kg basis of 10 mg / kg / week ) .
In an enhanced pre - and post - natal development study , intravenous doses up to 100 mg / kg tralokinumab - ldrm ( 10 times the MRHD on a mg / kg basis of 10 mg / kg / week ) were administered to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys once every week from the beginning of organogenesis to parturition .
No treatment - related adverse effects on embryofetal toxicity or malformations , or on morphological , functional , or immunological development were observed in the infants from birth through 6 months of age .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tralokinumab - ldrm in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Maternal IgG is present in breast milk .
The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure to ADBRY on the breastfed infant are unknown .
The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for ADBRY and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ADBRY or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ADBRY have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 1605 subjects exposed to ADBRY in 5 atopic dermatitis trials in the initial treatment period of up to 16 weeks , 77 subjects were 65 years or older .
Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no specific treatment for ADBRY overdose .
In the event of overdosage , contact Poison Control ( 1 - 800 - 222 - 1222 ) for latest recommendations and monitor the patient for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and institute appropriate symptomatic treatment immediately .
11 DESCRIPTION Tralokinumab - ldrm , an interleukin - 13 antagonist , is a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody .
Tralokinumab - ldrm is produced in mouse myeloma cells by recombinant DNA technology , consists of 1326 amino acids , and has a molecular weight of approximately 147 kilodaltons .
ADBRY ( tralokinumab - ldrm ) injection is a sterile , preservative - free , clear to opalescent , colorless to pale yellow solution for subcutaneous use supplied as a single - dose prefilled syringe with needle guard in a siliconized Type - 1 clear glass syringe .
None of the components of the prefilled syringe or the needle guard are made with natural rubber latex .
Each prefilled syringe delivers 150 mg tralokinumab - ldrm in 1 mL and the inactive ingredients : acetic acid ( 0 . 3 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 0 . 1 mg ) , sodium acetate trihydrate ( 6 mg ) , sodium chloride ( 5 mg ) , and Water for Injection , at an approximate pH of 5 . 5 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Tralokinumab - ldrm is a human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to human interleukin - 13 ( IL - 13 ) and inhibits its interaction with the IL - 13 receptor α1 and α2 subunits ( IL - 13Rα1 and IL - 13Rα2 ) .
IL - 13 is a naturally occurring cytokine of the Type 2 immune response .
Tralokinumab - ldrm inhibits the bioactivity of IL - 13 by blocking IL - 13 interaction with IL - 13Rα1 / IL - 4Rα receptor complex .
Tralokinumab - ldrm inhibits IL - 13 - induced responses including the release of proinflammatory cytokines , chemokines and IgE .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics ADBRY was associated with decreased concentrations of Th2 and Th22 immunity biomarkers in the blood , such as thymus and activation - regulated chemokine ( TARC / CCL17 ) , periostin , IL - 22 , lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) and serum IgE .
ADBRY decreased expression of keratin 16 and Ki - 67 in AD skin , and upregulated protein expression of loricrin .
ADBRY suppressed expression of genes in the Th2 pathway , including CCL17 , CCL18 and CCL26 as well as markers of Th17 - and Th22 - regulated genes in lesional skin .
The clinical relevance of these biomarkers is not fully understood .
Immune Response to Non - live Vaccines during Treatment Immune responses to non - live vaccines were assessed in a trial in which adult subjects with atopic dermatitis were treated with an initial dose of 600 mg ( four 150 mg injections ) followed by 300 mg every other week administered as subcutaneous injection .
After 12 weeks of ADBRY administration , subjects were vaccinated with a combined tetanus , diphtheria , and acellular pertussis vaccine , and a meningococcal vaccine .
Antibody responses were assessed 4 weeks later .
Antibody response to tetanus , diphtheria , acellular pertussis , and a meningococcal vaccine was similar in tralokinumab - ldrm treated and placebo treated subjects .
Immune responses to other vaccines were not assessed .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The mean ( SD ) steady - state trough concentration of tralokinumab - ldrm ranged from 98 . 0 ( 41 . 1 ) mcg / mL to 101 . 4 ( 42 . 7 ) mcg / mL following administration of ADBRY at 300 mg every other week .
Tralokinumab - ldrm exposure increased proportionally over a dosage range up to 2100 mg for a 70 kg subject ( 30 mg / kg IV ) ( 3 . 5 times the maximum approved recommended dosage ) .
Steady - state tralokinumab - ldrm concentrations were achieved by week 16 following a 600 mg starting dose and 300 mg every other week .
Absorption The absolute bioavailability of tralokinumab - ldrm was estimated to be 76 % .
The time to maximum tralokinumab - ldrm concentrations ( tmax ) was 5 to 8 days after administration .
Distribution The volume of distribution of tralokinumab - ldrm was estimated to be approximately 4 . 2 L . Elimination The half - life of tralokinumab - ldrm was 3 weeks and systemic clearance was estimated to be 0 . 149 L / day .
Metabolism Tralokinumab - ldrm is expected to be metabolized into small peptides by catabolic pathways .
Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of tralokinumab - ldrm were observed based on age ( ranged from 18 – 92 years ) , sex , mild to moderate renal impairment , or mild hepatic impairment .
The effect of severe renal impairment or moderate to severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of tralokinumab - ldrm is unknown .
Body Weight The exposure of tralokinumab - ldrm decreases with increasing body weight .
After 300 mg dose every 4 weeks , the median tralokinumab - ldrm exposure ( AUC ) of subjects with body weight of above 100 kg is expected to be 1 . 46 - fold lower than that of subjects weighing below 100 kg [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Drug Interaction Studies Cytochrome P450 Substrates The effects of tralokinumab on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam ( CYP3A4 substrate ) , warfarin ( CYP2C9 substrate ) , omeprazole ( CYP2C19 substrate ) , metoprolol ( CYP2D6 substrate ) , and caffeine ( CYP1A2 substrate ) were evaluated in a clinical trial in 18 - 20 subjects with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis receiving an initial SC dose of 600 mg followed by 300 mg SC every other week for 14 weeks .
No clinically significant changes in the exposure ( AUC or Cmax ) of the CYP450 substrates after multiple tralokinumab administrations were observed compared to that when administered alone .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential for tralokinumab - ldrm .
No effects on fertility parameters such as reproductive organs , menstrual cycle and sperm analysis were observed in male or female sexually mature cynomolgus monkeys that were subcutaneously administered tralokinumab - ldrm at doses up to 350 mg / animal ( 10 times the MRHD on a mg / kg basis of 10 mg / kg / week ) in females once a week for three consecutive menstrual cycles ( maximum of 15 doses ) or 600 mg / animal ( 10 times the MRHD on a mg / kg basis of 10 mg / kg / week ) in males once a week for 13 weeks .
The monkeys were not mated to evaluate fertility .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of ADBRY was assessed in three randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials [ ECZTRA 1 ( NCT03131648 ) , ECZTRA 2 ( NCT03160885 ) , and ECZTRA 3 ( NCT03363854 ) ] .
Efficacy was assessed in a total of 1934 subjects 18 years of age and older with moderate - to - severe atopic dermatitis ( AD ) not adequately controlled by topical medication ( s ) .
Disease severity was defined by an Investigator ' s Global Assessment ( IGA ) score ≥ 3 in the overall assessment of AD lesions on a severity scale of 0 to 4 , an Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI ) score ≥ 16 on a scale of 0 to 72 , and a minimum body surface area ( BSA ) involvement of ≥ 10 % .
At baseline , 58 % of subjects were male , 69 % of subjects were White , 50 % of subjects had a baseline IGA score of 3 ( moderate AD ) , and 50 % of subjects had a baseline IGA score of 4 ( severe AD ) .
The baseline mean EASI score was 32 and the baseline weekly averaged Worst Daily Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) was 8 on a scale of 0 - 10 .
In all three trials , subjects received subcutaneous injections of ADBRY 600 mg or placebo on Day 0 , followed by 300 mg every other week or placebo for 16 weeks .
Responders were defined as achieving an IGA 0 or 1 ( " clear " or " almost clear " ) or EASI - 75 ( improvement of at least 75 % in EASI score from baseline ) at Week 16 .
To evaluate maintenance of response in the monotherapy trials ( ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2 ) , subjects responding to initial treatment with ADBRY 300 mg every other week were re - randomized to ADBRY 300 mg every other week , ADBRY 300 mg every 4 weeks or placebo every other week for another 36 weeks following first dose administration .
Subjects randomized to placebo in the initial treatment period who achieved a clinical response at Week 16 continued to receive placebo every other week for another 36 weeks .
Non - responders at Week 16 , and subjects who lost clinical response during the maintenance period were placed on open - label treatment with ADBRY 300 mg every other week and optional use of TCS .
In the combination therapy trial ( ECZTRA 3 ) , subjects received either ADBRY 300 mg every other week with TCS or placebo with TCS and as needed topical calcineurin inhibitors ( TCI ) until Week 16 .
Subjects in the ADBRY 300 mg with TCS group who achieved clinical response at Week 16 were re - randomized to ADBRY 300 mg every other week with TCS or ADBRY every 4 weeks with TCS for another 16 weeks following first dose administration .
Subjects in the placebo with TCS group who achieved clinical response at Week 16 continued on placebo with TCS for another 16 weeks .
Subjects who did not achieve clinical response at Week 16 received ADBRY 300 mg every other week for another 16 weeks .
A mid - potency TCS ( i . e . , mometasone furoate 0 . 1 % cream ) was dispensed at each dosing visit .
Subjects were instructed to apply a thin film of the dispensed TCS as needed once daily to active lesions from Week 0 to Week 32 and were to discontinue treatment with TCS when control was achieved .
An additional , lower potency TCS or TCI could be used at the investigator ' s discretion on areas of the body where use of the supplied TCS was not advisable , such as areas of thin skin .
All three trials assessed the primary endpoints of the proportion of subjects with an IGA 0 or 1 at Week 16 and the proportion of subjects with EASI - 75 at Week 16 .
Secondary endpoints included the reduction of Worst Daily Pruritus NRS ( weekly average ) of at least 4 points on the 11 - point itch NRS from baseline to Week 16 .
Clinical Response at Week 16 ( ECZTRA 1 , ECZTRA 2 , and ECZTRA 3 ) The results of the ADBRY monotherapy trials ( ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2 ) and the ADBRY with TCS trial ( ECZTRA 3 ) are presented in Table 2 .
