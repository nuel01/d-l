Pharmacy Bulk Package — Not for Direct Infusion .
FOR USE ONLY WITH AUTOMATED COMPOUNDING DEVICES .
Flexible Container Rx only DESCRIPTION Sterile Water for Injection , USP is a sterile , nonpyrogenic water for injection intended only for dilution purposes .
The pH is 5 . 4 ( 5 . 0 to 7 . 0 ) .
The Pharmacy Bulk Package is a sterile dosage form which contains multiple single doses for use only in a pharmacy bulk admixture program .
Sterile Water for Injection , USP contains no bacteriostat , antimicrobial agent or added buffer .
Sterile Water for Injection , USP may be classified as a sterile diluent and pharmaceutical vehicle .
Sterile Water for Injection , USP is chemically designated H2O .
The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinylchloride .
Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions inside the plastic container also can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts before the expiration period is attained .
However , the safety of the plastic has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological standards for plastic containers .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70 % of total body weight .
Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters ( 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production ) .
Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms .
Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium ( Na + ) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sterile Water for Injection , USP in the Pharmacy Bulk Package is indicated for use with automated compounding devices for preparing intravenous admixtures in the pharmacy .
CONTRAINDICATIONS NOT FOR DIRECT INFUSION .
DO NOT USE FOR NON - AUTOMATED ADMIXTURE PREPARATIONS .
WARNINGS FOR DILUTION ONLY .
Do not heat over 66 ° C ( 150 ° F ) .
This preparation is solute - free and its entry into the circulation undiluted will cause hemolysis .
Absorption of large amounts of Sterile Water for Injection , USP with additives can cause fluid and / or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of administered solutions .
The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of such solutions .
WARNING : This product contains aluminum that may be toxic .
Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired .
Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature , and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions , which contain aluminum .
Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function , including premature neonates , who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg / kg / day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity .
Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration .
PRECAUTIONS Do not use unless water is clear , seal is intact and container is undamaged .
Aseptic technique is essential with the use of sterile preparations for compounding admixtures .
Discard container within 4 hours of entering closure .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Accidental contamination from careless technique may transmit infection .
Should any adverse reaction occur , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination , if deemed necessary .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Sterile Water for Injection , USP in the 2000 mL flexible Pharmacy Bulk Package is designed for use with automated compounding devices for preparing intravenous admixtures .
Dosages will be in accordance with the recommendation of the prescribing physician .
Sterile Water for Injection , USP is not intended for direct infusion .
Admixtures should be made by or under the direction of a pharmacist using strict aseptic technique under a laminar flow hood .
Compounded admixtures may be stored under refrigeration for up to 24 hours .
Administration of admixtures should be completed within 24 hours after removal from refrigeration .
Drug Interactions The Pharmacy Bulk Package is intended only for use in the preparation of sterile , intravenous admixtures using automated compounding devices .
Additives may be incompatible with the fluid withdrawn from this container .
Consult with pharmacist , if available .
When compounding admixtures , use aseptic technique , mix thoroughly and do not store .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution container permits .
See PRECAUTIONS .
Some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed .
This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety .
The opacity will diminish gradually .
Recommended Directions for Use of the Pharmacy Bulk Package Use Aseptic Technique 1 .
During use , container must be stored , and all manipulations performed , in an appropriate laminar flow hood .
2 .
Remove cover from outlet port at bottom of container .
3 .
Insert piercing pin of transfer set and suspend unit in a laminar flow hood .
Insertion of a piercing pin into the outlet port should be performed only once in a Pharmacy Bulk Package solution .
Once the outlet site has been entered , the withdrawal of container contents should be completed promptly in one continuous operation .
Should this not be possible , a maximum time of 4 hours from transfer set pin or implement insertion is permitted to complete fluid transfer operations ; i . e . , discard container no later than 4 hours after initial closure puncture .
4 .
Sequentially dispense aliquots of Sterile Water for Injection , USP into I . V . containers using appropriate transfer set .
During fluid transfer operations , the Pharmacy Bulk Package should be maintained under the storage conditions recommended in the labeling .
