How to Use the Blister Cards There are two ways to start taking birth control pills , Sunday Start or Day 1 Start .
Your healthcare professional will tell you which to use .
• Pick the Days of the Week Sticker that starts the first day of your period .
( This is the day you begin bleeding or spotting , even if it is midnight when bleeding begins . )
When you have picked the right sticker , throw away the others and place the sticker on the blister card over the pre - printed days of the week and make sure it lines up with the pills .
• Your blister package consists of three parts , the foil pouch , wallet , and a blister pack containing 28 individually sealed pills .
Note that the pills are arranged in four numbered rows of 7 pills , with the pre - printed days of the week printed above them .
There are 7 gray “ active ” pills , 7 light blue “ active ” pills , 7 blue “ active ” pills , and 7 white “ reminder ” pills .
Refer to the sample of the blister card below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] • After taking the last white pill , start a new blister card the very next day no matter when your period started .
You will be taking a pill every day without interruption .
Anytime you start the pills later than directed , protect yourself by using another method of birth control until you have taken a pill a day for seven consecutive days .
After taking the last white pill , start taking the first gray pill from the blister card the very next day .
• Take the pills in each new package as before .
Start with the gray pill on row # 1 and take one pill each day , left to right , until the last white pill has been taken .
Three Ways to Remember in What Order to Take the Pills • Follow the sticker with the days of the week ( placed above the pills ) .
• Always go from left to right .
• Always finish all your pills .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 2 . 3 Missed Tablets Table 2 : Instructions for Missed Tri - Lo - Sprintec Tablets • If one active tablet is missed in Weeks 1 , 2 , or 3 Take the tablet as soon as possible .
Continue taking one tablet a day until the pack is finished .
• If two active tablets are missed in Week 1 or Week 2 Take the two missed tablets as soon as possible and the next two active tablets the next day .
Continue taking one tablet a day until the pack is finished .
Additional non - hormonal contraception ( such as condoms and spermicide ) should be used as back ‑ up if the patient has sex within 7 days after missing tablets .
• If two active tablets are missed in the third week or three or more active tablets are missed in a row in Weeks 1 , 2 , or 3 Day 1 start : Throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack that same day .
Sunday start : Continue taking one tablet a day until Sunday , then throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack that same day .
Additional non - hormonal contraception ( such as condoms and spermicide ) should be used as back - up if the patient has sex within 7 days after missing tablets .
2 . 4 Advice in Case of Gastrointestinal Disturbances In case of severe vomiting or diarrhea , absorption may not be complete and additional contraceptive measures should be taken .
If vomiting or diarrhea occurs within 3 to 4 hours after taking an active tablet , handle this as a missed tablet [ see FDA - Approved Patient Labeling ] .

Examples include women who are known to : • Smoke , if over age 35 [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Have deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism , now or in the past [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Have inherited or acquired hypercoagulopathies [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Have cerebrovascular disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Have coronary artery disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Have thrombogenic valvular or thrombogenic rhythm diseases of the heart ( for example , subacute bacterial endocarditis with valvular disease , or atrial fibrillation ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Have uncontrolled hypertension [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Have diabetes mellitus with vascular disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Have headaches with focal neurological symptoms or migraine headaches with aura [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] • Women over age 35 with any migraine headaches [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] • Liver tumors , benign or malignant , or liver disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] • Pregnancy , because there is no reason to use COCs during pregnancy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] • Breast cancer or other estrogen - or progestin - sensitive cancer , now or in the past [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) ] • Use of Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir , due to the potential for ALT elevations [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • A high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic diseases ( 4 ) • Liver tumors or liver disease ( 4 ) • Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding ( 4 ) • Pregnancy ( 4 ) • Breast cancer or other estrogen - or progestin - sensitive cancer ( 4 ) • Co - administration with Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems : Stop Tri - Lo - Sprintec if a thrombotic event occurs .
Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery .
Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery , in women who are not breastfeeding .
( 5 . 1 ) • Liver disease : Discontinue Tri - Lo - Sprintec if jaundice occurs .
( 5 . 2 ) • High blood pressure : If used in women with well - controlled hypertension , monitor blood pressure and stop Tri - Lo - Sprintec if blood pressure rises significantly .
( 5 . 4 ) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects : Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Tri - Lo - Sprintec .
Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia .
( 5 . 6 ) • Headache : Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Tri - Lo - Sprintec if indicated .
( 5 . 7 ) • Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea : Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea .
( 5 . 8 ) 5 . 1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems • Stop Tri - Lo - Sprintec if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thrombotic ( VTE ) event occurs .
• Stop Tri - Lo - Sprintec if there is unexplained loss of vision , proptosis , diplopia , papilledema , or retinal vascular lesions .
Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
• If feasible , stop Tri - Lo - Sprintec at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization .
• Start Tri - Lo - Sprintec no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery , in women who are not breastfeeding .
The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week , whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week .
• The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE .
However , pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs .
The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10 , 000 woman - years .
The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer .
The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued .
• Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions , especially in women with other risk factors for these events .
COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events ( thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes ) .
This risk increases with age , particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke .
• Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors .
5 . 2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use Tri - Lo - Sprintec in women with liver disease , such as acute viral hepatitis or severe ( decompensated ) cirrhosis of liver [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded .
Discontinue Tri - Lo - Sprintec if jaundice develops .
Liver Tumors Tri - Lo - Sprintec is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use .
An estimate of the attributable risk is 3 . 3 cases / 100 , 000 COC users .
Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra - abdominal hemorrhage .
Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long - term ( > 8 years ) COC users .
However , the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users .
5 . 3 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir , ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) , including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN , were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol - containing medications , such as COCs .
Discontinue Tri - Lo - Sprintec prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Tri - Lo - Sprintec can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen .
5 . 4 High Blood Pressure Tri - Lo - Sprintec is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
For women with well - controlled hypertension , monitor blood pressure and stop Tri - Lo - Sprintec if blood pressure rises significantly .
An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs , and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use .
The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin .
5 . 5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users .
Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease .
A past history of COC - related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use .
Women with a history of pregnancy - related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis .
5 . 6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Tri - Lo - Sprintec .
COCs may decrease glucose tolerance .
Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia .
A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs .
Women with hypertriglyceridemia , or a family history thereof , may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs .
5 . 7 Headache If a woman taking Tri - Lo - Sprintec develops new headaches that are recurrent , persistent , or severe , evaluate the cause and discontinue Tri - Lo - Sprintec if indicated .
Consider discontinuation of Tri - Lo - Sprintec in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use ( which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event ) .
5 . 8 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled ( breakthrough or intracyclic ) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs , especially during the first three months of use .
If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles , check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy .
If pathology and pregnancy are excluded , bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product .
In the clinical trial of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol , the frequency and duration of unscheduled bleeding and / or spotting was assessed in 1 , 673 women ( 11 , 015 evaluable cycles ) .
A total of 3 ( 0 . 2 % ) women discontinued norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol , at least in part , due to bleeding or spotting .
Based on data from the clinical trials , 7 to 17 % of women using norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year .
The percent of women who experienced unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time .
Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who use Tri - Lo - Sprintec may experience amenorrhea .
Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs , especially when such a condition was pre - existent .
If scheduled ( withdrawal ) bleeding does not occur , consider the possibility of pregnancy .
If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule ( missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have ) , consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures .
If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods , rule out pregnancy .
5 . 9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy .
Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect , particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned , when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy .
Discontinue Tri - Lo - Sprintec use if pregnancy is confirmed .
Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 10 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Tri - Lo - Sprintec if depression recurs to a serious degree .
5 . 11 Carcinoma of Breasts and Cervix • Tri - Lo - Sprintec is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer .
Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer , more recent studies have not confirmed such findings .
• Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia .
However , there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors .
5 . 12 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine - binding globulin , sex hormone - binding globulin , and cortisol - binding globulin .
The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased .
5 . 13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare .
5 . 14 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema , exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema .
5 . 15 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur , especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum .
Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Tri - Lo - Sprintec .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling : • Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Vascular events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Liver disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are : • Irregular uterine bleeding • Nausea • Breast tenderness • Headache The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials ( ≥ 2 % ) were : headache / migraine , nausea / vomiting , breast issues , abdominal pain , menstrual disorders , mood disorders , acne , vulvovaginal infection , abdominal distension , weight increased , fatigue .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Teva Pharmaceuticals USA , Inc . at 1 - 888 - 838 - 2872 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
The safety of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol was evaluated in 1 , 723 subjects who participated in a randomized , partially blinded , multicenter , active - controlled clinical trial of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol for contraception .
This trial examined healthy , nonpregnant , volunteers aged 18 to 45 ( nonsmoker if 35 to 45 years of age ) , who were sexually active with regular coitus .
Subjects were followed for up to 13 28 - day cycles .
Common Adverse Reactions ( ≥ 2 % of subjects ) : The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2 % of the 1 , 723 women using the 28 - day regimen were the following in order of decreasing incidence : headache / migraine ( 30 . 5 % ) , nausea / vomiting ( 16 . 3 % ) ; breast issues ( including tenderness , pain , enlargement , swelling , discharge , discomfort , cyst , and nipple pain ) ( 10 . 3 % ) , abdominal pain ( 9 . 2 % ) , menstrual disorders ( including dysmenorrhea , menstrual discomfort , menstrual disorder ) ( 9 . 2 % ) , mood disorders ( including depression , mood altered , mood swings and depressed mood ) ( 7 . 6 % ) ; acne ( 5 . 1 % ) , vulvovaginal infection ( 3 . 5 % ) , abdominal distension ( 2 . 8 % ) , weight increased ( 2 . 4 % ) , fatigue ( 2 . 1 % ) .
Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation : In the clinical trial of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol 4 % of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction .
The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache / migraine ( 1 . 2 % ) , nausea / vomiting ( 0 . 7 % ) , cervical dysplasia ( 0 . 7 % ) , abdominal pain ( 0 . 4 % ) , ovarian cyst ( 0 . 3 % ) , acne ( 0 . 2 % ) , flatulence ( 0 . 2 % ) and depression ( 0 . 2 % ) .
Serious Adverse Reactions : carcinoma of the cervix in situ ( 1 subject ) and cervical dysplasia ( 1 subject ) .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate / ethinyl estradiol .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Infections and Infestations : Urinary tract infection Neoplasms Benign , Malignant and Unspecified ( Including Cysts and Polyps ) : Breast cancer , benign breast neoplasm , hepatic adenoma , focal nodular hyperplasia , breast cyst Immune System Disorders : Hypersensitivity Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders : Dyslipidemia Psychiatric Disorders : Anxiety , insomnia Nervous System Disorders : Syncope , convulsion , paresthesia , dizziness Eye Disorders : Visual impairment , dry eye , contact lens intolerance Ear and Labyrinth Disorders : Vertigo Cardiac Disorders : Tachycardia , palpitations Vascular Events : Deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , retinal vascular thrombosis , hot flush Arterial Events : Arterial thromboembolism , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident Respiratory , Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders : Dyspnea Gastrointestinal Disorders : Pancreatitis , abdominal distension , diarrhea , constipation Hepatobiliary Disorders : Hepatitis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Angioedema , erythema nodosum , hirsutism , night sweats , hyperhidrosis , photosensitivity reaction , urticaria , pruritus , acne Musculoskeletal , Connective Tissue , and Bone Disorders : Muscle spasms , pain in extremity , myalgia , back pain Reproductive System and Breast Disorders : Ovarian cyst , suppressed lactation , vulvovaginal dryness General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : Chest pain , asthenic conditions .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations .
No drug - drug interaction studies were conducted with Tri - Lo - Sprintec .
Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes including CYP3A4 , may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding .
Counsel patients to use a back - up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances Decreasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes , including cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) , may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding .
Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of COCs include phenytoin , barbiturates , carbamazepine , bosentan , felbamate , griseofulvin , oxcarbazepine , rifampicin , topiramate , rifabutin , rufinamide , aprepitant and products containing St . John ’ s wort .
Interactions between COCs and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and / or contraceptive failure .
Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back - up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs , and to continue back - up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability .
Colesevelam : Colesevelam , a bile acid sequestrant , given together with a COC , has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of ethinyl estradiol ( EE ) .
The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart .
Substances Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs Co - administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20 to 25 % .
Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations , possibly by inhibition of conjugation .
CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole , voriconazole , fluconazole , grapefruit juice , or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations .
Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) / Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) Protease Inhibitors and Non - nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Significant changes ( increase or decrease ) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and / or progestin have been noted in some cases of co - administration with HIV protease inhibitors ( decrease [ e . g . , nelfinavir , ritonavir , darunavir / ritonavir , ( fos ) amprenavir / ritonavir , lopinavir / ritonavir , and tipranavir / ritonavir ] or increase [ e . g . , indinavir and atazanavir / ritonavir ] ) / HCV protease inhibitors ( decrease [ e . g . , boceprevir and telaprevir ] ) or with non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( decrease [ e . g . , nevirapine ] or increase [ e . g . , etravirine ] ) .
7 . 2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs • COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds ( e . g . , cyclosporine , prednisolone , theophylline , tizanidine , and voriconazole ) and increase their plasma concentrations .
• COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen , clofibric acid , morphine , salicylic acid , temazepam and lamotrigine .
Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown , likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation .
This may reduce seizure control ; therefore , dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary .
Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid - binding globulin increases with use of COCs .
7 . 3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests , such as coagulation factors , lipids , glucose tolerance , and binding proteins .
7 . 4 Concomitant Use with HCV Combination Therapy – Liver Enzyme Elevation Do not co - administer Tri - Lo - Sprintec with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir , due to potential for ALT elevations [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers : Not recommended ; can decrease milk production .
( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy There is little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who inadvertently use COCs during early pregnancy .
Epidemiologic studies and meta - analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non - genital birth defects ( including cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects ) following exposure to low dose COCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy .
Do not administer COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding as a test for pregnancy .
Do not use COCs during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Advise the nursing mother to use other forms of contraception , when possible , until she has weaned her child .
COCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers .
This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well - established ; however , it can occur at any time in some women .
Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and / or metabolites are present in breast milk .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of Tri - Lo - Sprintec tablets have been established in women of reproductive age .
Efficacy is expected to be the same for post - pubertal adolescents under the age of 18 and for users 18 years and older .
Use of this product before menarche is not indicated .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Tri - Lo - Sprintec has not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of Tri - Lo - Sprintec has not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment .
However , steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with hepatic impairment .
Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded .

Other possible mechanisms may include cervical mucus changes that inhibit sperm penetration and endometrial changes that reduce the likelihood of implantation .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with Tri - Lo - Sprintec .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Norgestimate ( NGM ) and EE are rapidly absorbed following oral administration .
NGM is rapidly and completely metabolized by first pass ( intestinal and / or hepatic ) mechanisms to norelgestromin ( NGMN ) and norgestrel ( NG ) , which are the major active metabolites of NGM .
Mean pharmacokinetic parameters for NGMN , NG and EE during three cycles of administration of Tri - Lo - Sprintec are summarized in Table 3 .
Peak serum concentrations of NGMN and EE were generally reached by 2 hours after administration of Tri - Lo - Sprintec .
Accumulation following multiple dosing of the 0 . 180 mg NGM / 0 . 025 mg EE dose is approximately 1 . 5 to 2 fold for NGMN and approximately 1 . 5 fold for EE compared with single dose administration , in agreement with that predicted based on linear kinetics of NGMN and EE .
The pharmacokinetics of NGMN is dose proportional following NGM doses of 0 . 180 to 0 . 250 mg .
Steady - state conditions for NGMN following each NGM dose and for EE were achieved during the three cycle study .
Non - linear accumulation ( 4 . 5 to 14 . 5 fold ) of NG was observed as a result of high affinity binding to SHBG , which limits its biological activity .

Distribution NGMN and NG are highly bound ( > 97 % ) to serum proteins .
NGMN is bound to albumin and not to SHBG , while NG is bound primarily to SHBG .
EE is extensively bound ( > 97 % ) to serum albumin and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of SHBG .
Metabolism NGM is extensively metabolized by first - pass mechanisms in the gastrointestinal tract and / or liver .
NGM ’ s primary active metabolite is NGMN .
Subsequent hepatic metabolism of NGMN occurs and metabolites include NG , which is also active and various hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites .
Although NGMN and its metabolites inhibit a variety of P450 enzymes in human liver microsomes , under the recommended dosing regimen , the in vivo concentrations of NGMN and its metabolites , even at the peak serum levels , are relatively low compared to the inhibitory constant ( Ki ) .
EE is also metabolized to various hydroxylated products and their glucuronide and sulfate conjugates .
Excretion Following 3 cycles of administration of Tri - Lo - Sprintec , the mean ( ± SD ) elimination half - life values , at steady - state , for NGMN , NG and EE were 28 . 1 ( ± 10 . 6 ) hours , 36 . 4 ( ± 10 . 2 ) hours and 17 . 7 ( ± 4 . 4 ) hours , respectively ( Table 2 ) .
The metabolites of NGMN and EE are eliminated by renal and fecal pathways .
Use in Specific Populations Effects of Body Weight , Body Surface Area , and Age The effects of body weight , body surface area , age and race on the pharmacokinetics of NGMN , NG and EE were evaluated in 79 healthy women using pooled data following single dose administration of NGM 0 . 180 or 0 . 250 mg / EE 0 . 025 mg tablets in four pharmacokinetic studies .
Increasing body weight and body surface area were each associated with decreases in Cmax and AUC0 - 24 h values for NGMN and EE and increases in CL / F ( oral clearance ) for EE .
Increasing body weight by 10 kg is predicted to reduce the following parameters : NGMN Cmax by 9 % and AUC0 - 24 h by 19 % , NG Cmax by 12 % and AUC0 - 24 h by 46 % , EE Cmax by 13 % and AUC0 - 24 h by 12 % .
These changes were statistically significant .
Increasing age was associated with slight decreases ( 6 % with increasing age by 5 years ) in Cmax and AUC0 - 24 h for NGMN and were statistically significant , but there was no significant effect for NG or EE .
Only a small to moderate fraction ( 5 to 40 % ) of the overall variability in the pharmacokinetics of NGMN and EE following Tri - Lo - Sprintec tablets may be explained by any or all of the above demographic parameters .
