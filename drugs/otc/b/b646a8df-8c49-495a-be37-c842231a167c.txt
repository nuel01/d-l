Severe hypercalcemia may require emergency attention .
Risk may be increased when used concomitantly with high dose calcium preparations , thiazide diuretics , or vitamin D compounds .
Monitor serum calcium prior to initiation and during treatment and adjust dose accordingly .
( 2 , 5 . 1 ) • Digitalis Toxicity : Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digitalis toxicity .
In patients using digitalis compounds , monitor serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity .
Increase frequency of monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of HECTOROL .
( 5 . 2 ) • Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions : Anaphylaxis , with symptoms of angioedema , hypotension , unresponsiveness , chest discomfort , shortness of breath , and cardiopulmonary arrest , has been reported in hemodialysis patients after administration of HECTOROL .
Monitor patients upon treatment initiation for hypersensitivity reactions .
Should a reaction occur , discontinue and treat .
( 5 . 3 ) • Adynamic Bone Disease : May develop and increase risk of fractures if intact PTH levels are suppressed to abnormally low levels .
Monitor intact PTH levels to avoid oversuppression and adjust dose if needed .
( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Hypercalcemia Hypercalcemia may occur during HECTOROL treatment .
Acute hypercalcemia may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the effect of digitalis on the heart [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft - tissue calcification .
Severe hypercalcemia may require emergency attention .
Hypercalcemia may be exacerbated by concomitant administration of high doses of calcium - containing preparations , thiazide diuretics , or other vitamin D compounds [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
In addition , high intake of calcium and phosphate concomitantly with vitamin D compounds may lead to hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia .
Patients with a history of hypercalcemia prior to initiating therapy may be at increased risk for development of hypercalcemia with HECTOROL .
In these circumstances , frequent serum calcium monitoring and HECTOROL dose adjustments may be required .
When initiating HECTOROL or adjusting HECTOROL dose , measure serum calcium frequently ( weekly in patients with CKD on dialysis or every 2 weeks for patients with stage 3 or 4 CKD ) .
Once a maintenance dose has been established , measure serum calcium monthly for 3 months and then every 3 months .
If hypercalcemia occurs , reduce the dose or discontinue HECTOROL until serum calcium is normal [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Inform patients about the symptoms of elevated calcium ( feeling tired , difficulty thinking clearly , loss of appetite , nausea , vomiting , constipation , increased thirst , increased urination and weight loss ) and instruct them to report new or worsening symptoms when they occur .
5 . 2 Digitalis Toxicity HECTOROL can cause hypercalcemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] which increases the risk of digitalis toxicity .
In patients using HECTOROL concomitantly with digitalis compounds , monitor both serum calcium and patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity .
Increase the frequency of monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of HECTOROL [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
5 . 3 Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions , including fatal outcome , have been reported post marketing in patients on hemodialysis following administration of HECTOROL injection .
Hypersensitivity reactions include anaphylaxis with symptoms of angioedema ( involving face , lips , tongue and airways ) , hypotension , unresponsiveness , chest discomfort , shortness of breath , and cardiopulmonary arrest .
These reactions may occur separately or together .
Monitor patients receiving HECTOROL upon initiation of treatment for hypersensitivity reactions .
Should a hypersensitivity reaction occur , discontinue HECTOROL , monitor and treat if indicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
5 . 4 Adynamic Bone Disease Adynamic bone disease with subsequent increased risk of fractures may develop if intact PTH levels are suppressed by HECTOROL to abnormally low levels .
Monitor intact PTH levels to avoid oversuppression and adjust the HECTOROL dose , if needed [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .

Adverse reactions in patients with CKD on dialysis HECTOROL capsules have been evaluated in two placebo - controlled , double - blind studies in patients with CKD on hemodialysis .
Patients were treated with HECTOROL capsules ( n = 61 ) or placebo ( n = 61 ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
After randomization to two groups , eligible patients underwent an 8 - week washout period during which no vitamin D derivatives were administered to either group .
Subsequently , all patients received HECTOROL capsules in an open - label fashion for 16 weeks followed by a double - blind period of 8 weeks during which patients received either HECTOROL capsules or placebo .
Adverse reactions occurring in the HECTOROL capsule groups at a frequency of 2 % or greater , and more frequently than in the placebo group are presented in Table 2 .
Table 2 : Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥ 2 % HECTOROL Capsule - Treated Patients with CKD on Dialysis and Greater than Placebo in Two Double - Blind Clinical Studies Adverse Reaction [ 1 ] HECTOROL ( n = 61 ) % Placebo ( n = 61 ) % Edema 34 21 Malaise 28 20 Headache 28 18 Nausea / Vomiting 21 20 Dizziness 12 10 Dyspnea 12 7 Pruritus 8 7 Bradycardia 7 5 Anorexia 5 3 Dyspepsia 5 2 Arthralgia 5 0 Weight increase 5 0 Abscess 3 0 Sleep disorder 3 0 [ 1 ] A patient who reported the same medical term more than once was counted only once for that medical term .
HECTOROL Injection Adverse reactions in patients with CKD on hemodialysis HECTOROL injection has been studied in 70 patients with CKD on hemodialysis in two 12 - week , open - label , single - arm , multicenter studies [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
The incidence of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia increased during therapy with HECTOROL injection .
Patients with higher pretreatment serum levels of calcium ( > 10 . 5 mg / dL ) or phosphorus ( > 6 . 9 mg / dL ) were more likely to experience hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia .
There was no placebo group included in the studies of HECTOROL injection .
Adverse reactions in patients with CKD on hemodialysis receiving HECTOROL injection are expected to be similar to those reported in placebo - controlled studies of HECTOROL capsules presented in Table 2 .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of HECTOROL .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Hypersensitivity reactions , including fatal outcome , have been reported in patients on hemodialysis following administration of HECTOROL injection .
Hypersensitivity reactions include anaphylaxis with symptoms of angioedema ( involving face , lips , tongue and airways ) , hypotension , unresponsiveness , chest discomfort , shortness of breath , cardiopulmonary arrest , pruritus , and skin burning sensation .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Tables 3 and 4 include clinically significant drug interactions with HECTOROL .
Table 3 : Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with HECTOROL Injection and HECTOROL CapsulesDrugs that May Increase the Risk of Hypercalcemia Clinical Impact Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium - containing preparations or other vitamin D compounds may increase the risk of hypercalcemia .
Thiazide diuretics are known to induce hypercalcemia by reducing excretion of calcium in the urine .
Examples Calcium - containing products , other vitamin D compounds or thiazide diuretics Intervention Monitor serum calcium concentrations more frequently and adjust HECTOROL dose as needed [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Digitalis Compounds Clinical Impact Doxercalciferol can cause hypercalcemia which can potentiate the risk of digitalis toxicity .
Intervention Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity and increase frequency of serum calcium monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of HECTOROL in patients receiving digitalis compounds [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors Clinical Impact Doxercalciferol is activated by CYP 27 in the liver .
Cytochrome P450 inhibitors may inhibit the 25 - hydroxylation of doxercalciferol and thus reduce the formation of active doxercalciferol moiety [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Examples Ketoconazole and erythromycin Intervention If a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a cytochrome P450 inhibitor , dose adjustment of HECTOROL may be necessary .
Monitor intact PTH and serum calcium concentrations closely .
Enzyme Inducers Clinical Impact Doxercalciferol is activated by CYP 27 in the liver .
Enzyme inducers may affect the 25 - hydroxylation of doxercalciferol [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Examples Glutethimide and phenobarbital Intervention If a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with an enzyme inducer , dose adjustment of HECTOROL may be necessary .
Monitor intact PTH and serum calcium concentrations closely .
Magnesium - containing Products Clinical Impact Concomitant administration of HECTOROL and high doses of magnesium - containing products may increase the risk of hypermagnesemia .
Examples Magnesium - containing products such as antacids Intervention Avoid use of magnesium - containing products and HECTOROL in patients on chronic renal dialysis .
Table 4 : Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with HECTOROL CapsulesCholestyramine Clinical Impact Cholestyramine has been reported to reduce intestinal absorption of fat - soluble vitamins .
Therefore , it may impair intestinal absorption of HECTOROL capsules .
Intervention Administer HECTOROL capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine .
Mineral Oil or other Substances that May Affect Absorption of Fat Clinical Impact The use of mineral oil or other substances that may affect absorption of fat may influence the absorption and availability of HECTOROL .
Intervention Administer HECTOROL capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking mineral oil or other substances that may affect absorption of fat .
• Cytochrome P450 inhibitors : Formation of the active doxercalciferol moiety may be hindered and may necessitate dosage adjustment .
Monitor intact PTH and serum calcium concentrations closely .
( 7 ) • Enzyme inducers : Formation of the active doxercalciferol moiety may be affected and may necessitate dosage adjustment .
Monitor intact PTH and serum calcium concentrations closely .
( 7 ) • Magnesium - containing products : Combined use may cause hypermagnesemia .
Monitor serum magnesium concentrations more frequently and adjust dose as needed .
( 7 ) • Cholestyramine : May impair absorption of HECTOROL capsules .
Administer HECTOROL capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking cholestyramine .
( 7 ) • Mineral oil or other substances that may affect absorption of fat : May impair absorption of HECTOROL capsules .
Administer HECTOROL capsules at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after taking substances that may affect absorption .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with HECTOROL in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug - associated risk for major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with chronic kidney disease in pregnancy [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
In reproduction studies in rats and rabbits administered doxercalciferol during organogenesis at up to 20 mcg / kg / day and 0 . 1 mcg / kg / day , respectively ( approximately 25 times ( rats ) and less than ( rabbits ) the maximum recommended human oral dose of 60 mcg / week based on mcg / m2 body surface area ) , no adverse developmental effects were observed [ see Data ] .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % – 4 % and 15 % – 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk Chronic kidney disease in pregnancy increases the risk for maternal hypertension and preeclampsia , miscarriage , preterm delivery polyhydramnios , stillbirth , and low - birth - weight infants .
Data Animal data There were no adverse effects on fetal development when doxercalciferol was administered at doses up to 20 mcg / kg / day in pregnant rats or doses up to 0 . 1 mcg / kg / day in pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of doxercalciferol in human milk , the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant , or the effects of the drug on milk production .
Infants exposed to HECTOROL through breast milk should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for HECTOROL and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from HECTOROL or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to Doxercalciferol Injection through breast milk should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia , including seizures , vomiting , constipation and weight loss .
Monitoring of serum calcium in the infant should be considered .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of HECTOROL in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of HECTOROL did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years or over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment may not metabolize HECTOROL appropriately .
More frequent monitoring of intact PTH , calcium , and phosphorus levels should be done in patients with hepatic impairment .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage of HECTOROL may lead to hypercalcemia , hypercalciuria , and hyperphosphatemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The treatment of acute overdosage should consist of supportive measures and discontinuation of HECTOROL administration .
Serum calcium levels should be measured until normal .
Based on similarities between doxercalciferol and its active metabolite , 1α , 25 - ( OH ) 2D2 , it is expected that doxercalciferol is not removed from the blood by dialysis .
11 DESCRIPTION HECTOROL contains doxercalciferol , which is a synthetic vitamin D2 analog .
Doxercalciferol undergoes metabolic activation in vivo to form 1α , 25 - dihydroxyvitamin D2 ( 1α , 25 - ( OH ) 2D2 ) , a naturally occurring , biologically active form of vitamin D2 .
Doxercalciferol is a colorless crystalline compound with a calculated molecular weight of 412 . 66 and a molecular formula of C28H44O2 .
It is soluble in oils and organic solvents , but is relatively insoluble in water .
Chemically , doxercalciferol is ( 1α , 3β , 5 Z , 7 E , 22 E ) - 9 , 10 - secoergosta - 5 , 7 , 10 ( 19 ) , 22 - tetraene - 1 , 3 - diol .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Capsules HECTOROL capsules are soft gelatin capsules containing 0 . 5 mcg , 1 mcg , or 2 . 5 mcg doxercalciferol for oral use .
Each capsule also contains butylated hydroxyanisole ( BHA ) , ethanol , and fractionated triglyceride of coconut oil .
The capsule shells contain gelatin , glycerin , and titanium dioxide .
In addition , the 0 . 5 mcg capsule shells contain yellow iron oxide and FD & C Red No . 40 , the 1 mcg capsule shells contain FD & C Yellow No . 6 , and the 2 . 5 mcg capsule shells contain yellow iron oxide .
Injection HECTOROL injection 1 mL single - dose vials contain 2 mcg / mL of doxercalciferol .
HECTOROL injection 2 mL single - dose vials contain 4 mcg / 2 mL ( 2 mcg / mL ) of doxercalciferol .
Each milliliter ( mL ) of solution contains 2 mcg doxercalciferol and the following inactive ingredients : butylated hydroxytoluene ( 0 . 02 mg ) ; disodium edetate ( 1 . 1 mg ) ; ethanol , 100 % ( 0 . 05 mL ) ; polysorbate 20 ( 10 mg ) ; sodium chloride ( 1 . 5 mg ) ; sodium phosphate dibasic , heptahydrate ( 14 . 4 mg ) ; and sodium phosphate monobasic , monohydrate ( 1 . 8 mg ) .
HECTOROL injection 2 mL multiple - dose vials contain 4 mcg / 2 mL ( 2 mcg / mL ) of doxercalciferol .
Each milliliter ( mL ) of solution contains 2 mcg doxercalciferol and the following inactive ingredients : butylated hydroxytoluene ( 0 . 02 mg ) ; disodium edetate ( 1 . 1 mg ) ; ethanol , 100 % ( 0 . 075 mL ) ; polysorbate 20 ( 10 mg ) ; sodium chloride ( 1 . 5 mg ) ; sodium phosphate dibasic , heptahydrate ( 14 . 4 mg ) ; and sodium phosphate monobasic , monohydrate ( 1 . 8 mg ) .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Doxercalciferol is a synthetic vitamin D2 analog that requires metabolic activation to form the active 1α , 25 - ( OH ) 2D2 metabolite , which binds to the vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) to result in the selective activation of vitamin D responsive pathways .
Vitamin D and doxercalciferol have been shown to reduce PTH levels by inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In healthy volunteers , peak blood levels of 1α , 25 - ( OH ) 2D2 , the major metabolite of doxercalciferol , are attained at 8 hours after a single intravenous dose of HECTOROL and at 11 to 12 hours following capsule doses .
Elimination The mean elimination half - life of 1α , 25 - ( OH ) 2D2 after an oral dose is approximately 32 to 37 hours with a range of up to 96 hours .
Metabolism Doxercalciferol is activated by CYP 27 in the liver to form 1α , 25 - ( OH ) 2D2 ( major metabolite ) and 1α , 24 - dihydroxyvitamin D2 ( minor metabolite ) .
Activation of doxercalciferol does not require the involvement of the kidneys .
Specific Populations Patients with renal impairment The mean elimination half - life of 1α , 25 - ( OH ) 2D2 in patients with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) and in healthy volunteers appears to be similar following an oral dose .
Hemodialysis causes a temporary increase in 1α , 25 - ( OH ) 2D2 mean concentrations , presumably due to volume contraction .
1α , 25 - ( OH ) 2D2 is not removed from blood during hemodialysis .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a 104 - week carcinogenicity study in rats , there was an increased incidence of benign and malignant adrenal pheochromocytomas in both males and females at oral doses of 0 . 04 , 0 . 13 , and 0 . 39 mcg / kg / day ( less than the maximum recommended human oral dose of 60 mcg / week based on mcg / m2 body surface area ) .
This increased incidence of pheochromocytomas in rats may be due to altered calcium homeostasis by doxercalciferol .
No evidence of genetic toxicity was observed in an in vitro bacterial mutagenicity assay ( Ames test ) or a mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay .
Doxercalciferol caused structural chromatid and chromosome aberrations in an in vitro human lymphocyte clastogenicity assay with metabolic activation .
However , doxercalciferol was negative in an in vivo mouse micronucleus clastogenicity assay .
Doxercalciferol had no effect on male or female fertility in rats at oral doses up to 2 . 5 mcg / kg / day ( approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human oral dose of 60 mcg / week based on mcg / m2 body surface area ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Clinical Studies of HECTOROL Capsules in Patients with Stage 3 or 4 CKD The safety and effectiveness of HECTOROL capsules were evaluated in two clinical studies in 55 patients with Stage 3 or 4 CKD .
Eighty - two percent of the patients were male , the average age was 65 years , 51 % were Caucasian , 40 % African - American , and the average serum intact PTH level at baseline was 195 pg / mL .
While levels of 25 - ( OH ) vitamin D were not evaluated at baseline , retrospective assessments of stored serum revealed that the mean ± SD serum 25 - ( OH ) vitamin D was 19 ± 8 ng / mL ( range : < 5 to 54 ng / mL ) in the study population .
After randomization to two groups , eligible patients underwent an 8 - week washout period during which no vitamin D derivatives were administered to either group .
Subsequently , one group received HECTOROL capsules and the other placebo during the double - blind period of 24 weeks .
The initial dose of HECTOROL capsules was 1 mcg per day .
The dosage of HECTOROL capsules was adjusted as necessary by the investigator to reduce intact PTH levels to a target of ≥ 30 % below postwashout baseline .
The maximum dosage was limited to 3 . 5 mcg per day .
If at any time during the trial intact PTH fell below 15 pg / mL , HECTOROL capsules were immediately suspended and restarted at a lower dosage the following week .
Decreases in the mean plasma intact PTH from baseline values were calculated using as baseline the average of the last 2 values obtained during the 8 - week washout phase .
In analyses of pooled data from the two studies , intact PTH levels decreased from baseline by an average of 101 pg / mL in the HECTOROL capsules group and by 4 pg / mL in the placebo group ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
Twenty ( 74 % ) of 27 subjects in the HECTOROL capsules group achieved mean plasma intact PTH suppression of ≥ 30 % from baseline for the last four weeks of treatment , whereas two ( 7 % ) of the 28 subjects treated with placebo achieved this level of intact PTH suppression .
14 . 2 Clinical Studies of HECTOROL Capsules in Patients with CKD on Dialysis The safety and effectiveness of HECTOROL capsules were evaluated in two double - blind , placebo - controlled , multicenter clinical studies ( Study A and Study B ) in a total of 138 patients with CKD on hemodialysis .
Patients in Study A were an average age of 52 years ( range : 22 to 75 ) , were 55 % male , and were 58 % African - American , 31 % Caucasian , and 11 % Hispanic , and had been on hemodialysis for an average of 53 months .
Patients in Study B were an average of 52 years ( range : 27 to 75 ) , were 45 % male , and 99 % African - American , and 1 % Caucasian , and had been on hemodialysis for an average of 56 months .
After randomization to two groups , eligible patients underwent an 8 - week washout period during which no vitamin D derivatives were administered to either group .
Subsequently , all patients received HECTOROL capsules in an open - label fashion for 16 weeks followed by a double - blind period of 8 weeks during which patients received either HECTOROL capsules or placebo .
The initial dose of HECTOROL capsules during the open - label phase was 10 mcg after each dialysis session ( 3 times weekly ) for a total of 30 mcg per week .
The dosage of HECTOROL was adjusted as necessary by the investigator to achieve intact PTH levels within 150 pg / mL to 300 pg / mL .
The maximum dosage was limited to 20 mcg after each dialysis session ( 60 mcg / week ) .
If at any time during the trial intact PTH fell below 150 pg / mL , HECTOROL was immediately suspended and restarted at a lower dosage the following week .
Mean weekly doses during the 16 - week open - label period ranged from 15 mcg to 29 mcg in Study A and from 19 mcg to 28 mcg in Study B .
One hundred and six ( 77 % ) of the 138 patients who were treated with HECTOROL capsules during the 16 - week open - label phase achieved intact PTH levels ≤ 300 pg / mL .
Ninety - four ( 68 % ) of these patients exhibited plasma intact PTH levels ≤ 300 pg / mL on at least 3 occasions .
Eighty - seven ( 63 % ) patients had plasma intact PTH levels < 150 pg / mL on at least one occasion during the open - label phase of study participation .
Decreases in plasma intact PTH from baseline values were calculated using as baseline the average of the last 3 values obtained during the 8 - week washout phase and are displayed in Table 5 .

HECTOROL capsules treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction from baseline in mean intact PTH levels during the 16 - week open - label treatment period in more than 94 % of the 138 treated patients .
During the double - blind period ( weeks 17 to 24 ) , the reduction in mean intact PTH levels was maintained in the HECTOROL capsules treatment group compared to a return to near baseline in the placebo group .
14 . 3 Clinical Studies of HECTOROL Injection in Patients with CKD on Dialysis The safety and effectiveness of HECTOROL injection were evaluated in two open - label , single - arm , multicenter clinical studies ( Study C and Study D ) in a total of 70 patients with CKD on hemodialysis .
Patients in Study C were an average age of 54 years ( range : 23 to 73 ) , were 50 % male , and were 61 % African - American , 25 % Caucasian , and 14 % Hispanic , and had been on hemodialysis for an average of 65 months .
Patients in Study D were an average age of 51 years ( range : 28 to 76 ) , were 48 % male , and 100 % African - American and had been on hemodialysis for an average of 61 months .
This group of 70 of the 138 patients who had been treated with HECTOROL capsules in prior clinical studies ( Study A and Study B ) received HECTOROL Injection in an open - label fashion for 12 weeks following an 8 - week washout ( control ) period .
Dosing of HECTOROL injection was initiated at the rate of 4 mcg administered at the end of each dialysis session ( 3 times weekly ) for a total of 12 mcg per week .
The dosage of HECTOROL was adjusted to achieve intact PTH levels ( measured weekly ) within a targeted range of 150 pg / mL to 300 pg / mL .
The dosage was increased by 2 mcg per dialysis session after 8 weeks of treatment if the intact PTH levels remained above 300 pg / mL and were greater than 50 % of baseline levels .
The maximum dosage was limited to 18 mcg per week .
If at any time during the study intact PTH fell below 150 pg / mL , HECTOROL injection was immediately suspended and restarted at a lower dosage the following week .
Mean weekly doses ranged from ranged from 9 mcg to 13 mcg in Study C and ranged from 9 mcg to 12 mcg in Study D . Fifty - two ( 74 % ) of the 70 patients who were treated with HECTOROL injection achieved intact PTH levels ≤ 300 pg / mL .
Forty - one ( 59 % ) of these patients exhibited plasma intact PTH levels ≤ 300 pg / mL on at least 3 occasions .
Thirty - six ( 51 % ) patients had plasma intact PTH levels < 150 pg / mL on at least one occasion during study participation .
Decreases in plasma intact PTH from baseline values were calculated using as baseline the average of the last 3 values obtained during the 8 - week washout period and are displayed in Table 6 .
