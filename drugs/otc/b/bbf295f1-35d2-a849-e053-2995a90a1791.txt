DESCRIPTION Clindamycin Phosphate Topical Solution and Clindamycin Phosphate Lotion ( Clindamycin Phosphate Topical Suspension USP , 1 % ) contain clindamycin phosphate , USP , at a concentration equivalent to 10 mg clindamycin per milliliter .
Clindamycin Phosphate Gel contains clindamycin phosphate , USP , at a concentration equivalent to 10 mg clindamycin per gram .
Clindamycin phosphate is a water soluble ester of the semi - synthetic antibiotic produced by a 7 ( S ) - chloro - substitution of the 7 ( R ) - hydroxyl group of the parent antibiotic lincomycin .
The solution contains isopropyl alcohol 50 % v / v , propylene glycol , and purified water .
The gel contains allantoin , carbomer 974 P , methylparaben , polyethylene glycol 400 , propylene glycol , sodium hydroxide , and purified water .
The lotion contains cetostearyl alcohol ( 2 . 5 % ) ; glycerin ; glyceryl stearate SE ( with potassium monostearate ) ; isostearyl alcohol ( 2 . 5 % ) ; methylparaben ( 0 . 3 % ) ; sodium lauroyl sarcosinate ; stearic acid ; and purified water .
The structural formula is represented below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The chemical name for clindamycin phosphate is Methyl 7 - chloro - 6 , 7 , 8 - trideoxy - 6 - ( 1 - methyl - trans - 4 - propyl - L - 2 - pyrrolidinecarboxamido ) - 1 - thio - L - threo - α - D - galacto - octopyranoside 2 - ( dihydrogen phosphate ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Although clindamycin phosphate is inactive in vitro , rapid in vivo hydrolysis converts this compound to the antibacterially active clindamycin .
Cross resistance has been demonstrated between clindamycin and lincomycin .
Antagonism has been demonstrated between clindamycin and erythromycin .
Following multiple topical applications of clindamycin phosphate at a concentration equivalent to 10 mg clindamycin per mL in an isopropyl alcohol and water solution , very low levels of clindamycin are present in the serum ( 0 to 3 ng / mL ) and less than 0 . 2 % of the dose is recovered in urine as clindamycin .
Clindamycin activity has been demonstrated in comedones from acne patients .
The mean concentration of antibiotic activity in extracted comedones after application of Clindamycin Phosphate Topical Solution for 4 weeks was 597 mcg / g of comedonal material ( range 0 to 1 , 490 ) .
Clindamycin in vitro inhibits all Propionibacterium acnes cultures tested ( MICs 0 . 4 mcg / mL ) .
Free fatty acids on the skin surface have been decreased from approximately 14 % to 2 % following application of clindamycin .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clindamycin Phosphate Topical Solution , Clindamycin Phosphate Gel , and Clindamycin Phosphate Lotion are indicated in the treatment of acne vulgaris .
In view of the potential for diarrhea , bloody diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis , the physician should consider whether other agents are more appropriate .
( See CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS . )
CONTRAINDICATIONS Clindamycin Phosphate Topical Solution , Clindamycin Phosphate Gel , and Clindamycin Phosphate Lotion are contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to preparations containing clindamycin or lincomycin , a history of regional enteritis or ulcerative colitis , or a history of antibiotic - associated colitis .
WARNINGS Orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been associated with severe colitis which may result in patient death .
Use of the topical formulation of clindamycin results in absorption of the antibiotic from the skin surface .
Diarrhea , bloody diarrhea , and colitis ( including pseudomembranous colitis ) have been reported with the use of topical and systemic clindamycin .
Studies indicate a toxin ( s ) produced by clostridia is one primary cause of antibiotic - associated colitis .
The colitis is usually characterized by severe persistent diarrhea and severe abdominal cramps and may be associated with the passage of blood and mucus .
Endoscopic examination may reveal pseudomembranous colitis .
Stool culture for Clostridium difficile and stool assay for C . difficile toxin may be helpful diagnostically .
When significant diarrhea occurs , the drug should be discontinued .
Large bowel endoscopy should be considered to establish a definitive diagnosis in cases of severe diarrhea .
Antiperistaltic agents such as opiates and diphenoxylate with atropine may prolong and / or worsen the condition .
Vancomycin has been found to be effective in the treatment of antibiotic - associated pseudomembranous colitis produced by Clostridium difficile .
The usual adult dosage is 500 mg to 2 grams of vancomycin orally per day in three to four divided doses administered for 7 to 10 days .
Cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind vancomycin in vitro .
If both a resin and vancomycin are to be administered concurrently , it may be advisable to separate the time of administration of each drug .
Diarrhea , colitis , and pseudomembranous colitis have been observed to begin up to several weeks following cessation of oral and parenteral therapy with clindamycin .
PRECAUTIONS General : Clindamycin Phosphate Topical Solution contains an alcohol base which will cause burning and irritation of the eye .
In the event of accidental contact with sensitive surfaces ( eye , abraded skin , mucous membranes ) , bathe with copious amounts of cool tap water .
The solution has an unpleasant taste and caution should be exercised when applying medication around the mouth .
Clindamycin phosphate should be prescribed with caution in atopic individuals .
Drug Interactions : Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents .
Therefore it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic effects In clinical trials with pregnant women , the systemic administration of clindamycin during the second and third trimesters , has not been associated with an increased frequency of congenital abnormalities .
There are no adequate studies in pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy .
Clindamycin should be used during the first trimester of pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers : It is not known whether clindamycin is excreted in human milk following use of clindamycin phosphate .
However , orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been reported to appear in breast milk .
Clindamycin has the potential to cause adverse effects on the breastfed infant ' s gastrointestinal flora .
If oral or intravenous clindamycin is required by a nursing mother , it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding , but an alternate drug may be preferred .
Monitor the infant for possible adverse effects on the gastrointestinal flora , such as diarrhea , candidiasis ( thrush , diaper rash ) or rarely , blood in the stool indicating possible antibiotic - associated colitis .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for clindamycin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from clindamycin or from the underlying maternal condition .
Pediatric Use : Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients under the age of 12 have not been established .
Geriatric Use : Clinical studies for topical Clindamycin products did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
ADVERSE REACTIONS In 18 clinical studies of various formulations of clindamycin phosphate using placebo vehicle and / or active comparator drugs as controls , patients experienced a number of treatment emergent adverse dermatologic events [ see table below ] .
