6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
During clinical trials , 1401 subjects were exposed to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide .
A total of 1036 subjects with acne vulgaris , 12 years and older , were treated once daily for 12 weeks to 12 months .
Related adverse events reported within 12 weeks of treatment and in at least 1 % of subjects treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide and those reported in subjects treated with the vehicle are presented in Table 1 : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] During a pediatric clinical trial , 285 children with acne vulgaris , 9 to 11 years of age were treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide or with the vehicle once daily for 12 weeks .
Overall , the safety profile of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide in these subjects is comparable to the safety profile observed in older subjects 12 years of age and above , both in the nature and frequency of the observed events .
Analysis of local tolerability evaluations shows similar incidence of treatment emergent signs and symptoms as in subjects 12 years of age and above , with local tolerability signs and symptoms peaking during the first week and decreasing over time .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide : eyelid edema , sunburn , blister , pain of skin , pruritus , swelling face , conjunctivitis , skin discoloration , rash , eczema , throat tightness and allergic contact dermatitis .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant topical acne therapy should be used with caution because a possible cumulative irritancy effect may occur , especially with the use of peeling , desquamating , or abrasive agents .
No formal drug - drug interaction studies were conducted with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category C There are no well - controlled trials in pregnant women treated with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with the combination or benzoyl peroxide .
Furthermore , such studies are not always predictive of human response ; therefore , adapalene and benzoyl peroxide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus .
No teratogenic effects were observed in rats treated with oral doses of 0 . 15 to 5 mg adapalene / kg / day , up to 25 times ( mg / m2 / day ) the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide .
However , teratogenic changes were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of greater than or equal to 25 mg adapalene / kg / day representing 123 and 246 times MRHD , respectively .
Findings included cleft palate , microphthalmia , encephalocele and skeletal abnormalities in rats ; and umbilical hernia , exophthalmos and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits .
Dermal teratology studies conducted in rats and rabbits at doses of 0 . 6 to 6 mg adapalene / kg / day [ 25 to 59 times ( mg / m2 ) the MRHD ] exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether adapalene or benzoyl peroxide is excreted in human milk following use of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when adapalene and benzoyl peroxide is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide in pediatric patients under the age of 9 have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein .
Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation , keratinization and inflammatory processes .
However , the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown .
Benzoyl peroxide Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects 12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide is unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 10 adult subjects with acne vulgaris who were treated once daily for 30 days with 2 grams / day of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide applied to 1000 cm2 of acne involved skin , ( face , chest , and upper back ) .
Two subjects ( 20 % ) had quantifiable adapalene plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification ( LOQ = 0 . 1 ng / mL ) .
The highest adapalene Cmax and AUC0 - 24 h was 0 . 21 ng / mL and 1 . 99 ng • h / mL , respectively .
Excretion of adapalene appears to be primarily by the biliary route .
Pharmacokinetics of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide in pediatric subjects have not been evaluated .
Benzoyl peroxide is absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid and eliminated in the urine .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity , photocarcinogenicity , genotoxicity , or fertility studies were conducted with adapalene and benzoyl peroxide .
Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene have been conducted in mice at topical doses of 0 . 4 , 1 . 3 , and 4 mg / kg / day ( 1 . 2 , 3 . 9 , and 12 mg / m2 / day ) , and in rats at oral doses of 0 . 15 , 0 . 5 , and 1 . 5 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 9 , 3 , and 9 mg / m2 / day ) .
In terms of body surface area , the highest dose levels are 9 . 8 ( mice ) and 7 . 4 times ( rats ) the MRHD of 2 grams of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide .
In the rat study , an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromcytomas in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed .
No significant increase in tumor formation was observed in rodents topically treated with 15 to 25 % benzoyl peroxide carbopol ( 6 to 10 times the concentration of benzoyl peroxide in adapalene and benzoyl peroxide ) for two years .
Rats received maximum daily applications of 138 ( males ) and 205 ( females ) mg benzoyl peroxide / kg .
In terms of body surface area , these levels are 27 to 40 times the MRHD .
Similar results were obtained in mice topically treated with 25 % benzoyl peroxide carbopol for 56 weeks followed by intermittent treatment with 15 % benzoyl peroxide carbopol for rest of the 2 years study period , and in mice topically treated with 5 % benzoyl peroxide carbopol for two years .
The role of benzoyl peroxide as a tumor promoter has been well established in several animal species .
However , the significance of this finding in humans is unknown .
In a photocarcinogenicity study conducted with 5 % benzoyl peroxide carbopol , no increase in UV - induced tumor formation was observed in hairless mice topically treated for 40 weeks .
No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted with adapalene .
However , animal studies have shown an increased tumorigenic risk with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs ( e . g . , retinoids ) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or sunlight .
Although the significance of these findings to humans is not clear , patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial irradiation sources .
Adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic effects in vitro ( Ames test , Chinese hamster ovary cell assay , mouse lymphoma TK assay ) or in vivo ( mouse micronucleus test ) .
Bacterial mutagenicity assays ( Ames test ) with benzoyl peroxide has provided mixed results , mutagenic potential was observed in a few but not in a majority of investigations .
Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to produce single - strand DNA breaks in human bronchial epithelial and mouse epidermal cells , it has caused DNA - protein cross - links in the human cells , and has also induced a dose - dependent increase in sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells .
In rat oral studies , 20 mg adapalene / kg / day ( 120 mg / m2 / day ; 98 times the MRHD based on mg / m2 / day comparison ) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F0 males and females , or growth , development and reproductive function of F1 offspring .
No fertility studies were conducted with benzoyl peroxide .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide applied once daily for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in two 12 - week , multicenter , controlled clinical studies of similar design , comparing adapalene and benzoyl peroxide to the vehicle in acne subjects .
Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who had a two - grade improvement and rated ‘ Clear ’ and ‘ Almost Clear ’ at Week 12 based on the Investigator ’ s Global Assessment ( IGA ) and mean absolute change from baseline at Week 12 in both inflammatory and non - inflammatory lesion counts .
An IGA score of ‘ Clear ’ corresponded to residual hyperpigmentation and erythema may be present .
An IGA score of ‘ Almost Clear ’ corresponded to a few scattered comedones and a few small papules .
In Study 1 , 517 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide , adapalene 0 . 1 % in vehicle , benzoyl peroxide 2 . 5 % in vehicle .
The median age of these 517 subjects was 15 years old and 60 % were males .
At baseline subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non - inflammatory lesions .
The majority of subjects had a baseline IGA score of ‘ Moderate ’ which corresponded to more than half of the face is involved , many comedones , papules and pustules .
The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3 .
In Study 2 , 1668 subjects were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide , adapalene 0 . 1 % in vehicle , benzoyl peroxide 2 . 5 % in vehicle .
The median age of subjects was 16 years old and 49 % were males .
At baseline subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non - inflammatory lesions as well as an Investigator Global Assessment score of ‘ Moderate ’ .
The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3 .
In study 3 , 285 pediatric subjects 9 to 11 years of age were randomized to adapalene and benzoyl peroxide or vehicle .
The median age of subjects was 11 years and 24 % were males .
At baseline , subjects had a minimum of 20 but not more than 100 total lesions ( inflammatory and / or non - inflammatory ) with an Investigator Global Assessment score of ‘ Moderate ’ .
The efficacy results at week 12 are presented in Table 3 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] In both Studies 1 and 2 the treatment effect was smaller in subjects with a small number of baseline lesions than in subjects with a large number of baseline lesions .
