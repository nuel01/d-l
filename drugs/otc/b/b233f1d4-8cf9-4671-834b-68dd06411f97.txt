[ MULTIMEDIA ] Rx only [ MULTIMEDIA ] WARNING Carboplatin Injection should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents .
Appropriate management of therapy and complications is possible only when adequate treatment facilities are readily available .
Bone marrow suppression is dose related and may be severe , resulting in infection and / or bleeding .
Anemia may be cumulative and may require transfusion support .
Vomiting is another frequent drug - related side effect .
Anaphylactic - like reactions to Carboplatin Injection have been reported and may occur within minutes of Carboplatin Injection administration .
Epinephrine , corticosteroids , and antihistamines have been employed to alleviate symptoms .
DESCRIPTION Carboplatin Injection is supplied as a sterile , pyrogen - free , aqueous solution available in 50 mg / 5 mL , 150 mg / 15 mL , 450 mg / 45 mL or 600 mg / 60 mL multiple - dose vials containing 10 mg / mL of carboplatin for administration by intravenous infusion .
Each mL contains 10 mg carboplatin and Water for Injection , USP .
Carboplatin is a platinum coordination compound .
The chemical name for carboplatin is platinum , diammine [ 1 , 1 - cyclobutane - dicarboxylato ( 2 - ) - 0 , 0 ' ] - , ( SP - 4 - 2 ) , and carboplatin has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Carboplatin is a crystalline powder with the molecular formula of C6H12N204Pt and a molecular weight of 371 . 25 .
It is soluble in water at a rate of approximately 14 mg / mL , and the pH of a 1 % solution is 5 to 7 .
It is virtually insoluble in ethanol , acetone , and dimethylacetamide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Carboplatin , like cisplatin , produces predominantly interstrand DNA cross - links rather than DNA - protein cross - links .
This effect is apparently cell - cycle nonspecific .
The aquation of carboplatin , which is thought to produce the active species , occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin .
Despite this difference , it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug - DNA cross - links , causing equivalent lesions and biological effects .
The differences in potencies for carboplatin and cisplatin appear to be directly related to the difference in aquation rates .
In patients with creatinine clearances of about 60 mL / min or greater , plasma levels of intact carboplatin decay in a biphasic manner after a 30 - minute intravenous infusion of 300 mg / m2 to 500 mg / m2 of carboplatin .
The initial plasma half - life ( alpha ) was found to be 1 . 1 to 2 hours ( n = 6 ) , and the postdistribution plasma half - life ( beta ) was found to be 2 . 6 to 5 . 9 hours ( n = 6 ) .
The total body clearance , apparent volume of distribution and mean residence time for carboplatin are 4 . 4 L / hour , 16 L and 3 . 5 hours , respectively .
The Cmax values and areas under the plasma concentration versus time curves from 0 to infinity ( AUC inf ) increase linearly with dose , although the increase was slightly more than dose proportional .
Carboplatin , therefore , exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the dosing range studied ( 300 mg / m2 to 500 mg / m2 ) .
Carboplatin is not bound to plasma proteins .
No significant quantities of protein - free , ultrafilterable platinum - containing species other than carboplatin are present in plasma .
However , platinum from carboplatin becomes irreversibly bound to plasma proteins and is slowly eliminated with a minimum half - life of 5 days .
The major route of elimination of carboplatin is renal excretion .
Patients with creatinine clearances of approximately 60 mL / min or greater excrete 65 % of the dose in the urine within 12 hours and 71 % of the dose within 24 hours .
All of the platinum in the 24 - hour urine is present as carboplatin .
Only 3 % to 5 % of the administered platinum is excreted in the urine between 24 and 96 hours .
There are insufficient data to determine whether biliary excretion occurs .
In patients with creatinine clearances below 60 mL / min , the total body and renal clearances of carboplatin decrease as the creatinine clearance decreases .
Carboplatin Injection dosages should therefore be reduced in these patients ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
The primary determinant of Carboplatin Injection clearance is glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) and this parameter of renal function is often decreased in elderly patients .
Dosing formulas incorporating estimates of GFR ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) to provide predictable Carboplatin Injection plasma AUCs should be used in elderly patients to minimize the risk of toxicity .
CLINICAL STUDIES Use with Cyclophosphamide for Initial Treatment of Ovarian Cancer In two prospectively randomized , controlled studies conducted by the National Cancer Institute of Canada , Clinical Trials Group ( NCIC ) , and the Southwest Oncology Group ( SWOG ) , 789 chemotherapy naive patients with advanced ovarian cancer were treated with carboplatin or cisplatin , both in combination with cyclophosphamide every 28 days for six courses before surgical reevaluation .

Comparative Toxicity The pattern of toxicity exerted by the carboplatin containing regimen was significantly different from that of the cisplatin - containing combinations .
Differences between the two studies may be explained by different cisplatin dosages and by different supportive care .
The carboplatin - containing regimen induced significantly more thrombocytopenia and , in one study , significantly more leukopenia and more need for transfusional support .
The cisplatin - containing regimen produced significantly more anemia in one study .
However , no significant differences occurred in incidences of infections and hemorrhagic episodes .
Non - hematologic toxicities ( emesis , neurotoxicity , ototoxicity , renal toxicity , hypomagnesemia , and alopecia ) were significantly more frequent in the cisplatin - containing arms .

The duration of these responses ranged from 45 to 71 + weeks .
INDICATIONS Initial Treatment of Advanced Ovarian Carcinoma Carboplatin Injection is indicated for the initial treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma in established combination with other approved chemotherapeutic agents .
One established combination regimen consists of Carboplatin Injection and cyclophosphamide .
Two randomized controlled studies conducted by the NCIC and SWOG with carboplatin versus cisplatin , both in combination with cyclophosphamide , have demonstrated equivalent overall survival between the two groups ( see CLINICAL STUDIES ) .
There is limited statistical power to demonstrate equivalence in overall pathologic complete response rates and long - term survival ( ≥ 3 years ) because of the small number of patients with these outcomes : the small number of patients with residual tumor < 2 cm after initial surgery also limits the statistical power to demonstrate equivalence in this subgroup .
Secondary Treatment of Advanced Ovarian Carcinoma Carboplatin Injection is indicated for the palliative treatment of patients with ovarian carcinoma recurrent after prior chemotherapy , including patients who have been previously treated with cisplatin .
Within the group of patients previously treated with cisplatin , those who have developed progressive disease while receiving cisplatin therapy may have a decreased response rate .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Carboplatin Injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe allergic reactions to cisplatin or other platinum - containing compounds .
Carboplatin Injection should not be employed in patients with severe bone marrow depression or significant bleeding .
WARNINGS Bone marrow suppression ( leukopenia , neutropenia , and thrombocytopenia ) is dose - dependent and is also the dose - limiting toxicity .
Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during carboplatin treatment and , when appropriate , until recovery is achieved .
Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single agent carboplatin .
In general , single intermittent courses of carboplatin should not be repeated until leukocyte , neutrophil , and platelet counts have recovered .
Since anemia is cumulative , transfusions may be needed during treatment with carboplatin , particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy .
Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy , especially regimens including cisplatin .
Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function .
Initial carboplatin dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses .
The use of carboplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimize additive effects .
Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential , but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and / or audiologic toxicity , and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs .
Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents .
Carboplatin can induce emesis , which can be more severe in patients previously receiving emetogenic therapy .
The incidence and intensity of emesis have been reduced by using premedication with antiemetics .
Although no conclusive efficacy data exist with the following schedules of carboplatin , lengthening the duration of single intravenous administration to 24 hours or dividing the total dose over five consecutive daily pulse doses has resulted in reduced emesis .
Although peripheral neurotoxicity is infrequent , its incidence is increased in patients older than 65 years and in patients previously treated with cisplatin .
Pre - existing cisplatin - induced neurotoxicity does not worsen in about 70 % of the patients receiving carboplatin as secondary treatment .
Loss of vision , which can be complete for light and colors , has been reported after the use of carboplatin with doses higher than those recommended in the package insert .
Vision appears to recover totally or to a significant extent within weeks of stopping these high doses .
As in the case of other platinum - coordination compounds , allergic reactions to carboplatin have been reported .
These may occur within minutes of administration and should be managed with appropriate supportive therapy .
There is increased risk of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis in patients previously exposed to platinum therapy ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS : Allergic Reactions ) .
High dosages of carboplatin ( more than four times the recommended dose ) have resulted in severe abnormalities of liver function tests .
Carboplatin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Carboplatin has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while receiving this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus .
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant .
PRECAUTIONS General Needles or intravenous administration sets containing aluminum parts that may come in contact with Carboplatin Injection should not be used for the preparation or administration of the drug .
Aluminum can react with carboplatin causing precipitate formation and loss of potency .
Drug Interactions The renal effects of nephrotoxic compounds may be potentiated by carboplatin .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of carboplatin has not been studied , but compounds with similar mechanisms of action and mutagenicity profiles have been reported to be carcinogenic .
Carboplatin has been shown to be mutagenic both in vitro and in vivo .
It has also been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats receiving the drug during organogenesis .
Secondary malignancies have been reported in association with multi - drug therapy .
Pregnancy ( see WARNINGS ) .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether carboplatin is excreted in human milk .
Because there is a possibility of toxicity in nursing infants secondary to carboplatin treatment of the mother , it is recommended that breast - feeding be discontinued if the mother is treated with carboplatin .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established ( see WARNINGS ; " Audiologic Toxicity " ) .
Geriatric Use Of the 789 patients in initial treatment combination therapy studies ( NCIC and SWOG ) , 395 patients were treated with carboplatin in combination with cyclophosphamide .
Of these , 141 were over 65 years of age and 22 were 75 years or older .
In these trials , age was not a prognostic factor for survival .
In terms of safety , elderly patients treated with carboplatin were more likely to develop severe thrombocytopenia than younger patients .
In a combined database of 1 , 942 patients ( 414 were ≥ 65 years of age ) that received single agent carboplatin for different tumor types , a similar incidence of adverse events was seen in patients 65 years and older and in patients less than 65 .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
Because renal function is often decreased in the elderly , renal function should be considered in the selection of carboplatin dosage ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
ADVERSE REACTIONS For a comparison of toxicities when carboplatin or cisplatin was given in combination with cyclophosphamide , see CLINICAL STUDIES : Use with Cyclophosphamide for Initial Treatment of Ovarian Cancer : Comparative Toxicity .

Combination with cyclophosphamide as well as duration of treatment may be responsible for the differences that can be noted in the adverse experience table .
[ 2 ] Single Agent Use for the Secondary Treatment of Ovarian Cancer : Data are based on the experience of 553 patients with previously treated ovarian carcinoma ( regardless of baseline status ) who received single agent carboplatin .
In the narrative section that follows , the incidences of adverse events are based on data from 1 , 893 patients with various types of tumors who received carboplatin as single agent therapy .
Hematologic Toxicity Bone marrow suppression is the dose - limiting toxicity of carboplatin .
Thrombocytopenia with platelet counts below 50 , 000 / mm3 occurs in 25 % of the patients ( 35 % of pretreated ovarian cancer patients ) ; neutropenia with granulocyte counts below 1 , 000 / mm3 occurs in 16 % of the patients ( 21 % of pretreated ovarian cancer patients ) ; leukopenia with WBC counts below 2 , 000 / mm3 occurs in 15 % of the patients ( 26 % of pretreated ovarian cancer patients ) .
The nadir usually occurs about day 21 in patients receiving single agent therapy .
By day 28 , 90 % of patients have platelet counts above 100 , 000 / mm3 ; 74 % have neutrophil counts above 2 , 000 / mm3 ; 67 % have leukocyte counts above 4 , 000 / mm3 .
Marrow suppression is usually more severe in patients with impaired kidney function .
Patients with poor performance status have also experienced a higher incidence of severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia .
The hematologic effects , although usually reversible , have resulted in infectious or hemorrhagic complications in 5 % of the patients treated with carboplatin , with drug - related death occurring in less than 1 % of the patients .
Fever has also been reported in patients with neutropenia .
Anemia with hemoglobin less than 11 g / dL has been observed in 71 % of the patients who started therapy with a baseline above that value .
The incidence of anemia increases with increasing exposure to carboplatin .
Transfusions have been administered to 26 % of the patients treated with carboplatin ( 44 % of previously treated ovarian cancer patients ) .
Bone marrow depression may be more severe when carboplatin is combined with other bone marrow suppressing drugs or with radiotherapy .
Gastrointestinal Toxicity Vomiting occurs in 65 % of the patients ( 81 % of previously treated ovarian cancer patients ) and in about one - third of these patients it is severe .
Carboplatin , as a single agent or in combination , is significantly less emetogenic than cisplatin ; however , patients previously treated with emetogenic agents , especially cisplatin , appear to be more prone to vomiting .
Nausea alone occurs in an additional 10 % to 15 % of patients .
Both nausea and vomiting usually cease within 24 hours of treatment and are often responsive to antiemetic measures .
Although no conclusive efficacy data exist with the following schedules , prolonged administration of carboplatin , either by continuous 24 - hour infusion or by daily pulse doses given for five consecutive days , was associated with less severe vomiting than the single - dose intermittent schedule .
Emesis was increased when carboplatin was used in combination with other emetogenic compounds .
Other gastrointestinal effects observed frequently were pain , in 17 % of the patients ; diarrhea , in 6 % ; and constipation , also in 6 % .
Neurologic Toxicity Peripheral neuropathies have been observed in 4 % of the patients receiving carboplatin ( 6 % of pretreated ovarian cancer patients ) with mild paresthesias occurring most frequently .
Carboplatin therapy produces significantly fewer and less severe neurologic side effects than does therapy with cisplatin .
However , patients older than 65 years and / or previously treated with cisplatin appear to have an increased risk ( 10 % ) for peripheral neuropathies .
In 70 % of the patients with pre - existing cisplatin - induced peripheral neurotoxicity , there was no worsening of symptoms during therapy with carboplatin .
Clinical ototoxicity and other sensory abnormalities such as visual disturbances and change in taste have been reported in only 1 % of the patients .
Central nervous system symptoms have been reported in 5 % of the patients and appear to be most often related to the use of antiemetics .
Although the overall incidence of peripheral neurologic side effects induced by carboplatin is low , prolonged treatment , particularly in cisplatin pretreated patients , may result in cumulative neurotoxicity .
Nephrotoxicity Development of abnormal renal function test results is uncommon , despite the fact that carboplatin , unlike cisplatin , has usually been administered without high - volume fluid hydration and / or forced diuresis .
The incidences of abnormal renal function tests reported are 6 % for serum creatinine and 14 % for blood urea nitrogen ( 10 % and 22 % , respectively , in pretreated ovarian cancer patients ) .
Most of these reported abnormalities have been mild and about one - half of them were reversible .
Creatinine clearance has proven to be the most sensitive measure of kidney function in patients receiving carboplatin , and it appears to be the most useful test for correlating drug clearance and bone marrow suppression .
Twenty - seven percent of the patients who had a baseline value of 60 mL / min or more demonstrated a reduction below this value during carboplatin therapy .
Hepatic Toxicity The incidences of abnormal liver function tests in patients with normal baseline values were reported as follows : total bilirubin , 5 % ; SGOT , 15 % ; and alkaline phosphatase , 24 % ; ( 5 % , 19 % , and 37 % , respectively , in pretreated ovarian cancer patients ) .
These abnormalities have generally been mild and reversible in about one - half of the cases , although the role of metastatic tumor in the liver may complicate the assessment in many patients .
In a limited series of patients receiving very high dosages of carboplatin and autologous bone marrow transplantation , severe abnormalities of liver function tests were reported .
Electrolyte Changes The incidences of abnormally decreased serum electrolyte values reported were as follows : sodium , 29 % ; potassium , 20 % ; calcium , 22 % ; and magnesium , 29 % ; ( 47 % , 28 % , 31 % , and 43 % , respectively , in pretreated ovarian cancer patients ) .
Electrolyte supplementation was not routinely administered concomitantly with carboplatin , and these electrolyte abnormalities were rarely associated with symptoms .
Allergic Reactions Hypersensitivity to carboplatin has been reported in 2 % of the patients .
These allergic reactions have been similar in nature and severity to those reported with other platinum - containing compounds , i . e . , rash , urticaria , erythema , pruritus , and rarely bronchospasm and hypotension .
Anaphylactic reactions have been reported as part of post - marketing surveillance ( see WARNINGS ) .
These reactions have been successfully managed with standard epinephrine , corticosteroid , and antihistamine therapy .
Injection Site Reactions Injection site reactions , including redness , swelling , and pain , have been reported during post - marketing surveillance .
Necrosis associated with extravasation has also been reported .
Other Events Pain and asthenia were the most frequently reported miscellaneous adverse effects ; their relationship to the tumor and to anemia was likely .
Alopecia was reported ( 3 % ) .
Cardiovascular , respiratory , genitourinary , and mucosal side effects have occurred in 6 % or less of the patients .
Cardiovascular events ( cardiac failure , embolism , cerebrovascular accidents ) were fatal in less than 1 % of the patients and did not appear to be related to chemotherapy .
Cancer - associated hemolytic uremic syndrome has been reported rarely .
Malaise , anorexia , hypertension , dehydration , and stomatitis have been reported as part of post - marketing surveillance .
OVERDOSAGE There is no known antidote for Carboplatin Injection overdosage .
The anticipated complications of overdosage would be secondary to bone marrow suppression and / or hepatic toxicity .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION NOTE : Aluminum reacts with carboplatin causing precipitate formation and loss of potency , therefore , needles or intravenous sets containing aluminum parts that may come in contact with the drug must not be used for the preparation or administration of Carboplatin Injection .
Single Agent Therapy Carboplatin Injection , as a single agent , has been shown to be effective in patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma at a dosage of 360 mg / m2 IV on day 1 every 4 weeks ( alternatively see Formula Dosing ) .
In general , however , single intermittent courses of Carboplatin Injection should not be repeated until the neutrophil count is at least 2 , 000 and the platelet count is at least 100 , 000 .
Combination Therapy with Cyclophosphamide In the chemotherapy of advanced ovarian cancer , an effective combination for previously untreated patients consists of : Carboplatin Injection - 300 mg / m2 IV on day 1 every four weeks for six cycles ( alternatively see Formula Dosing ) .
Cyclophosphamide - 600 mg / m2 IV on day 1 every four weeks for six cycles .
For directions regarding the use and administration of cyclophosphamide please refer to its package insert .
( see CLINICAL STUDIES . )
Intermittent courses of Carboplatin Injection in combination with cyclophosphamide should not be repeated until the neutrophil count is at least 2 , 000 and the platelet count is at least 100 , 000 .
Dose Adjustment Recommendations Pretreatment platelet count and performance status are important prognostic factors for severity of myelosuppression in previously treated patients .
The suggested dose adjustments for single agent or combination therapy shown in the table below are modified from controlled trials in previously treated and untreated patients with ovarian carcinoma .
Blood counts were done weekly , and the recommendations are based on the lowest post - treatment platelet or neutrophil value .
Platelets Neutrophils Adjusted Dose [ 1 ] ( From Prior Course ) > 100 , 000 > 2 , 000 125 % 50 – 100 , 000 500 – 2 , 000 No Adjustment < 50 , 000 < 500 75 % [ 1 ] Percentages apply to Carboplatin Injection as a single agent or to both Carboplatin Injection and cyclophosphamide in combination .
In the controlled studies , dosages were also adjusted at a lower level ( 50 % to 60 % ) for severe myelosuppression .
Escalations above 125 % were not recommended for these studies .
Carboplatin Injection is usually administered by an infusion lasting 15 minutes or longer .
No pre - or post - treatment hydration or forced diuresis is required .
Patients with Impaired Kidney Function Patients with creatinine clearance values below 60 mL / min are at increased risk of severe bone marrow suppression .
In renally - impaired patients who received single agent Carboplatin Injection therapy , the incidence of severe leukopenia , neutropenia , or thrombocytopenia has been about 25 % when the dosage modifications in the table below have been used .
Baseline Creatinine Clearance Recommended Dose on Day 1 41 – 59 mL / min 250 mg / m2 16 – 40 mL / min 200 mg / m2 The data available for patients with severely impaired kidney function ( creatinine clearance below 15 mL / min ) are too limited to permit a recommendation for treatment .
These dosing recommendations apply to the initial course of treatment .
Subsequent dosages should be adjusted according to the patient ' s tolerance based on the degree of bone marrow suppression .
Formula Dosing Another approach for determining the initial dose of Carboplatin Injection is the use of mathematical formulae , which are based on a patient ' s pre - existing renal function or renal function and desired platelet nadir .
Renal excretion is the major route of elimination for carboplatin .
( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY . )
The use of dosing formulae , as compared to empirical dose calculation based on body surface area , allows compensation for patient variations in pretreatment renal function that might otherwise result in either underdosing ( in patients with above average renal function ) or overdosing ( in patients with impaired renal function ) .
A simple formula for calculating dosage , based upon a patient ' s glomerular filtration rate ( GFR in mL / min ) and Carboplatin Injection target area under the concentration versus time curve ( AUC in mg / mL ∙ min ) , has been proposed by Calvert .
In these studies , GFR was measured by 51 Cr - EDTA clearance .
CALVERT FORMULA FOR CARBOPLATIN DOSING Note : With the Calvert formula , the total dose of Carboplatin Injection is calculated in mg , not mg / m2 .
Total Dose ( mg ) = ( target AUC ) × ( GFR + 25 ) The target AUC of 4 mg / mL ∙ min to 6 mg / mL ∙ min using single agent Carboplatin Injection appears to provide the most appropriate dose range in previously treated patients .
This study also showed a trend between the AUC of single agent Carboplatin Injection administered to previously treated patients and the likelihood of developing toxicity .
% Actual Toxicity in Previously Treated PatientsAUC ( mg / mL ∙ min ) Gr 3 or Gr 4 Thrombocytopenia Gr 3 or Gr 4 Leukopenia 4 to 5 16 % 13 % 6 to 7 33 % 34 % Geriatric Dosing Because renal function is often decreased in elderly patients , formula dosing of Carboplatin Injection based on estimates of GFR should be used in elderly patients to provide predictable plasma Carboplatin Injection AUCs and thereby minimize the risk of toxicity .

Carboplatin Injection This information will help you learn more about Carboplatin Injection .
It cannot , however , cover all the possible warnings or side effects relating to Carboplatin Injection , and it does not list all of the benefits and risks of Carboplatin Injection .
Your doctor should always be your first choice for detailed information about your medical condition and your treatment .
Be sure to ask your doctor about any questions you may have .
What is cancer ?
Under normal conditions , the cells in your body divide and grow in an orderly , controlled fashion .
Cell division and growth are necessary for the human body to perform its functions and to repair itself .
Cancer cells are different from normal cells because they are not able to control their own growth .
The reasons for this abnormal growth are not yet fully understood .
A tumor is a mass of unhealthy cells that are dividing and growing fast and in an uncontrolled way .
When a tumor invades surrounding healthy body tissue it is known as a malignant tumor .
A malignant tumor can spread ( metastasize ) from its original location to other parts of the body .
What is Carboplatin Injection ?
Carboplatin Injection is a medicine that is used to treat cancer of the ovaries .
It acts by interfering with the division of rapidly multiplying cells , particularly cancer cells .
Who should not take Carboplatin Injection ?
Treatment with Carboplatin Injection is not recommended if you : • • are allergic to Carboplatin Injection or other platinum - containing products ; • • have a weakened blood - forming system ( bone marrow depression ) or significant bleeding ; • • are pregnant , intend to become pregnant , or are breast - feeding a baby .
How is Carboplatin Injection used ?
Only a professional experienced in the use of cancer drugs should give you this medication .
Carboplatin Injection is given by dripping the medicine slowly and directly into a vein ( intravenous infusion ) for 15 minutes or longer .
Your doctor will determine the dose of Carboplatin Injection for you based on your weight , height , and kidney function .
Carboplatin Injection may be given alone or with other drugs .
Treatment is usually repeated every four weeks for a number of cycles .
Before and after Carboplatin Injection treatment , your doctor may give you medication to lessen the nausea and vomiting associated with this cancer treatment .
What should you tell your doctor before starting treatment with Carboplatin Injection ?
Discuss the benefits and risks of Carboplatin Injection with your doctor before beginning treatment .
Be sure to inform your doctor : • • If you are allergic to Carboplatin Injection or other platinum containing products ; • • If you are or intend to become pregnant , since Carboplatin Injection may harm the developing fetus .
It is important to use effective birth control while you are being treated with Carboplatin Injection ; • • If you are breast - feeding , since nursing infants may be exposed to Carboplatin Injection in this way ; • • If you are taking other medicines , including all prescription and non prescription ( over - the - counter ) drugs , since Carboplatin Injection may affect the action of other medicines ; • • If you have any other medical problems , especially chicken pox ( including recent exposure to adults or children with chicken pox ) , shingles , hearing problems , infection , or kidney disease , since treatment with Carboplatin Injection increases the risk and severity of these conditions .
What should I avoid while taking Carboplatin Injection ?
If you are pregnant or think you might be pregnant , or if you are breast feeding , let your doctor know right away .
Carboplatin Injection may harm your developing fetus or breast - feeding baby .
If you are a woman of childbearing age , you should use birth control to avoid getting pregnant while you are taking Carboplatin Injection .
You should avoid contact with adults and children who have infections , and tell your doctor right away if you show signs of infection such as cough , fever , and / or chills .
Also , while you are being treated with Carboplatin Injection or after you stop treatment , first check with your doctor before getting any immunizations ( vaccinations ) .
Avoid contact with adults or children who have received oral polio vaccine since they can pass the polio virus to you .
What are the possible side effects of Carboplatin Injection ?
Carboplatin Injection may cause unwanted effects , particularly because Carboplatin Injection interferes with the growth of normal cells as well as cancer cells .
For example , the occurrence of another cancer ( secondary malignancy ) has been reported in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy with multiple drugs .
It is not always possible to tell whether such effects are caused by Carboplatin Injection , another drug you may be taking , or your illness .
Because some of these effects may be serious , you will need close medical supervision during treatment with Carboplatin Injection .
The most serious side effects of Carboplatin Injection are : • • bleeding and reduced blood cells , including reduced red blood cells ( anemia ) and platelets ( needed for proper blood clotting ) , which may be severe enough to require blood transfusion .
You should tell your doctor right away if you notice any unusual bruising or bleeding , including black tarry stools or blood in the urine .
• • infection – Carboplatin Injection can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood , increasing the risk of infection ; • • life - threatening allergic reaction – during and after treatment the doctor or nurse will observe you carefully for signs of allergic reaction ; • • kidney and liver problems ; • • loss of hearing or ringing in the ears ; Contact your doctor right away if you experience any of these effects , or notice effects that worry you or are troublesome .
Of the less serious side effects associated with Carboplatin Injection treatment , the most common are nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , loss of appetite , hair loss and numbness , tingling , burning , or pain in the hands or feet .
This medicine was prescribed for your particular condition .
It must be given under close medical supervision by a doctor trained in the use of drugs for the treatment of cancer .
