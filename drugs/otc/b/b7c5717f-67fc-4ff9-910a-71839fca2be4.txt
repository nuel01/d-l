The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading .
Treatment - emergent anti - drug antibodies ( ADA ) against tebentafusp - tebn were detected in 33 % and 29 % of patients receiving tebentafusp - tebn across all doses in study IMCgp100 - 102 and study IMCgp100 - 202 , respectively .
The median onset time to ADA formation was 6 - 9 weeks after tebentafusp - tebn treatment .
The ability of these binding ADAs to neutralize tebentafusp - tebn is unknown .
The tebentafusp - tebn clearance increased in patients with high titer ADAs [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Exploratory analyses with limited data suggest that formation of ADA does not appear to have clinically significant effect on frequency or severity of hypersensitivity related adverse reactions and no observed sign of decreased overall survival .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on the mechanism of action , KIMMTRAK may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data with KIMMTRAK in pregnant woman .
No animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been conducted with KIMMTRAK .
Molecules of similar molecular weight can cross the placenta resulting in fetal exposure .
Advise women of the potential risk to the fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % - 4 % and 15 % - 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tebentafusp - tebn in human milk , the effect on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Because tebentafusp - tebn may be excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child , advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with KIMMTRAK and for at least 1 week after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential KIMMTRAK may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating KIMMTRAK treatment .
Contraception Females Advise female of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 1 week following the last dose of KIMMTRAK [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of KIMMTRAK have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 245 patients with metastatic uveal melanoma treated with KIMMTRAK on IMCgp100 - 202 , 47 % were 65 years of age and older and 9 % were 75 years of age and older .
No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between patients ≥ 65 years of age compared to younger adult patients .
11 DESCRIPTION Tebentafusp - tebn is a bispecific gp100 peptide - HLA - directed T cell receptor CD3 T cell engager .
Tebentafusp - tebn has an approximate molecular weight of 77 kDa .
Tebentafusp - tebn is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Escherichia coli cells .
KIMMTRAK ( tebentafusp - tebn ) injection is supplied in a single - dose vial as a sterile , preservative - free , clear , colorless or slightly yellowish solution for intravenous administration by infusion .
Each single - dose vial contains tebentafusp - tebn ( 100 mcg ) , citric acid monohydrate ( 0 . 95 mg ) , di - sodium hydrogen phosphate ( 2 . 91 mg ) , mannitol ( 5 mg ) , polysorbate 20 ( 0 . 1 mg ) trehalose ( 25 mg ) , and water for injection , with a pH of 6 . 5 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Tebentafusp - tebn is a bispecific gp100 peptide - HLA - A * 02 : 01 directed T cell receptor CD3 T cell engager .
The TCR arm binds to a gp100 peptide presented by human leukocyte antigen - A * 02 : 01 ( HLA - A * 02 : 01 ) on the cell surface of uveal melanoma tumor cells .
In vitro , tebentafusp - tebn bound to HLA - A * 02 : 01 - positive uveal melanoma cells and activated polyclonal T cells to release inflammatory cytokines and cytolytic proteins , which results in direct lysis of uveal melanoma tumor cells .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Lymphocyte counts declined the day after the first 3 doses and returned to baseline prior to subsequent doses .
Serum levels of cytokines ( IFN - γ , TNFα , IL - 2 , IL - 6 , IL - 10 and IL - 1 RA ) and chemokines ( CXCL9 , CXCL10 , CXCL11 , hepatocyte growth factor , and monocyte chemoattractant protein - 1 ) were increased during the first three doses of KIMMTRAK with peak levels between 8 to 24 hours after treatment with KIMMTRAK and levels returned to baseline prior to subsequent doses .
In subsequent treatment cycles , cytokine elevation occurred in fewer patients with lesser intensity compared to the first 3 doses .
The exposure - response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of KIMMTRAK have not been fully characterized .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics After a single dose administration , tebentafusp - tebn Cmax and AUC0 - 7 d increased in an approximately dose proportional manner from 20 to 68 mcg ( 0 . 3 to 1 times the approved recommended dose ) .
Following administration of the approved recommended dosage in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma , the steady - state geometric mean ( % CV ) Cmax of tebentafusp - tebn is 13 ng / mL ( 34 . 6 % ) and AUC0 - 7 d is 4 . 6 ng . day / mL ( 23 % ) with no accumulation .
Distribution Tebentafusp - tebn geometric mean ( % CV ) steady - state volume of distribution is 7 . 56 L ( 24 % ) .
Elimination The geometric mean clearance of tebentafusp - tebn is 16 . 4 L / d ( CV : 24 . 5 % ) and median terminal half - life is 7 . 5 hours ( range : 6 . 8 - 7 . 5 hours ) .
Metabolism Tebentafusp - tebn is expected to be catabolized into small peptides and amino acids .
Specific Populations No clinically significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of tebentafusp - tebn were identified based on weight ( 43 to 163 kg ) , sex ( 48 % female ) , age ( 23 to 91 years ) , or mild to moderate renal impairment based on creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) estimated by C - G formula ( CLcr 30 to 89 mL / min ) or mild hepatic impairment as measured by total bilirubin ( TB ) and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ( TB ≤ upper limit of normal ( ULN ) and AST > ULN or TB > 1 to 1 . 5 x ULN and any AST ) .
Tebentafusp - tebn has not been studied in patients with severe ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) renal impairment or in patients with moderate ( TB > 1 . 5 to 3 x ULN , any AST ) to severe ( TB > 3 to 10 x ULN , any AST ) hepatic impairment .
Immunogenicity Median titer in the ADA - positive subgroup was 8192 across the 67 treatment cycles .
The exposure ( AUC0 - 7 days ) of tebentafusp - tebn decreased by 97 % and terminal half - life decreased to 10 - 14 minutes in patients with ADA titers greater than 8192 .
Drug Interaction Elevation of certain proinflammatory cytokines may suppress CYP450 enzyme activities .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity or genotoxicity studies have been conducted with tebentafusp - tebn .
No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of tebentafusp - tebn on fertility .
