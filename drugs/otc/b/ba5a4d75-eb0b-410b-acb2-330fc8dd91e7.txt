Diagnostic - For Intravenous Use DESCRIPTION Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc99m Mertiatide is used for the preparation of technetium Tc 99 m mertiatide , a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical .
It is supplied as a sterile , nonpyrogenic , lyophilized powder .
Each vial contains betiatide ( N - [ N - [ N - [ ( benzoylthio ) acetyl ] glycyl ] glycyl ] - glycine ) .
After reconstitution with sterile sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m injection , the technetium Tc 99 m mertiatide ( disodium [ N - [ N - [ N - ( mercaptoacetyl ) glycyl ] glycyl ] glycinato ( 2 - ) - N , N ′ , N ″ , S ′ ] oxotechnetate ( 2 - ) ) which is formed is suitable for intravenous administration .
Each 10 milliliter vial contains 1 milligram betiatide , 0 . 05 milligram ( minimum ) stannous chloride dihydrate ( SnCl2 ∙ 2H2O ) and 0 . 2 milligram ( maximum ) total tin expressed as stannous chloride dihydrate ( SnCl2 ∙ 2H2O ) , 40 milligrams sodium tartrate dihydrate ( Na2C4H2O6 ∙ 2H2O ) , and 20 milligrams lactose monohydrate .

The pH of the reconstituted drug is between 5 . 0 and 6 . 0 .
No bacteriostatic preservative is present .
The contents are sealed under argon .
Betiatide is light sensitive and must be protected from light .
Betiatide and technetium Tc 99 m mertiatide have the following structural formulas : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS Technetium Tc 99 m decays by isomeric transition with a physical half - life of 6 . 02 hours .
The principal photon that is useful for detection and imaging is listed in Table 1 .

The specific gamma ray constant for Technetium Tc 99 m is 0 . 78 R / mCi - hr at 1 cm .
The first half - value thickness of lead ( Pb ) for Technetium Tc 99 m is 0 . 017 cm .
A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 2 .
For example , the use of 0 . 25 cm of Pb will decrease the external radiation exposure by a factor of about 1000 .

Although technetium Tc 99 m mertiatide is highly plasma protein bound following intravenous injection , the protein binding is reversible and the tracer is rapidly excreted by the kidneys via active tubular secretion and glomerular filtration .
Following intravenous injection of technetium Tc 99 m mertiatide in normal volunteers , 89 % of the tracer was plasma protein bound .
In healthy subjects with normal renal function ( mean serum creatinine 1 . 2 mg / dL ) technetium Tc 99 m mertiatide was rapidly cleared from the blood .
The plasma clearance was approximately 0 . 3 liters / minute and the amount of technetium Tc 99 m mertiatide excreted in the urine in three hours was nearly 90 % of the dose .
In a study performed in three patients with renal impairment ( serum creatinine greater than 6 . 3 mg / dL ) , there was decreased blood clearance and a decrease in the amount excreted in the urine over three hours .
In these patients , 78 % of the tracer was plasma protein bound after intravenous injection .
The mean plasma clearance of technetium Tc 99 m mertiatide was 0 . 03 liters / minute and 21 . 3 % was excreted in three hours on average .
In both healthy subjects and patients with renal impairment , the plasma concentration - time profile showed a biexponential decline .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Technetium Tc 99 m mertiatide is a renal imaging agent for use in the diagnosis of congenital and acquired abnormalities , renal failure , urinary tract obstruction , and calculi in adults and pediatric patients .
( See Pediatric Use . )

PRECAUTIONS General 1 .
The contents of this kit are not radioactive .
However , after sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m is added , adequate shielding of the final preparation must be maintained .
2 .
Contents of the reaction vial are intended only for use in the preparation of technetium Tc 99 m mertiatide and are NOT to be administered directly to the patient .
3 .
To help reduce the radiation dose to the bladder , as well as other target organs , the patient should increase his or her fluid intake ( unless medically contraindicated ) and void as often as possible after the injection of technetium Tc 99 m mertiatide for six hours after the imaging procedure .
4 .
Technetium Tc 99 m mertiatide should not be used more than six hours after preparation .
