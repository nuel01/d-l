PRESCRIBING INFORMATION DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in Ondansetron in 5 % Dextrose Injection is ondansetron hydrochloride ( HCl ) , the racemic form of ondansetron and a selective blocking agent of the serotonin 5 - HT3 receptor type .
Chemically it is ( ± ) 1 , 2 , 3 , 9 - tetrahydro - 9 - methyl - 3 - [ ( 2 - methyl - 1 H - imidazol - 1 - yl ) methyl ] - 4 H - carbazol - 4 - one , monohydrochloride , dihydrate .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The empirical formula is C18H19N3O · HCl · 2H2O , representing a molecular weight of 365 . 9 .
Ondansetron HCl is a white to off - white powder that is soluble in water and normal saline .
Sterile , Premixed Solution for Intravenous Administration in Single - Dose , Flexible Plastic Containers : Each 50 mL contains ondansetron 32 mg ( as the hydrochloride dihydrate ) ; dextrose 2500 mg ; and citric acid 26 mg and sodium citrate 11 . 5 mg as buffers in Water for Injection , USP .
It contains no preservatives .
The osmolarity of this solution is 270 mOsm / L ( approx . )
, and the pH is 3 to 4 .
The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated , plastic film .
Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions inside the plastic container also can leach out certain chemical components in very small amounts before the expiration period is attained .
However , the safety of the plastic has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological standards for plastic containers .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics : Ondansetron is a selective 5 - HT3 receptor antagonist .
While ondansetron ' s mechanism of action has not been fully characterized , it is not a dopamine - receptor antagonist .
Serotonin receptors of the 5 - HT3 type are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema .
It is not certain whether ondansetron ' s antiemetic action in chemotherapy - induced nausea and vomiting is mediated centrally , peripherally , or in both sites .
However , cytotoxic chemotherapy appears to be associated with release of serotonin from the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine .
In humans , urinary 5 - HIAA ( 5 - hydroxyindoleacetic acid ) excretion increases after cisplatin administration in parallel with the onset of vomiting .
The released serotonin may stimulate the vagal afferents through the 5 - HT3 receptors and initiate the vomiting reflex .
In animals , the emetic response to cisplatin can be prevented by pretreatment with an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis , bilateral abdominal vagotomy and greater splanchnic nerve section , or pretreatment with a serotonin 5 - HT3 receptor antagonist .
In normal volunteers , single I . V . doses of 0 . 15 mg / kg of ondansetron had no effect on esophageal motility , gastric motility , lower esophageal sphincter pressure , or small intestinal transit time .
In another study in six normal male volunteers , a 16 - mg dose infused over 5 minutes showed no effect of the drug on cardiac output , heart rate , stroke volume , blood pressure , or electrocardiogram ( ECG ) .
Multiday administration of ondansetron has been shown to slow colonic transit in normal volunteers .
Ondansetron has no effect on plasma prolactin concentrations .
In a gender - balanced pharmacodynamic study ( n = 56 ) , ondansetron 4 mg administered intravenously or intramuscularly was dynamically similar in the prevention of nausea and vomiting using the ipecacuanha model of emesis .
Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium .
Interactions with general or local anesthetics have not been studied .
Pharmacokinetics : Ondansetron is extensively metabolized in humans , with approximately 5 % of a radiolabeled dose recovered as the parent compound from the urine .
The primary metabolic pathway is hydroxylation on the indole ring followed by glucuronide or sulfate conjugation .
Although some nonconjugated metabolites have pharmacologic activity , these are not found in plasma at concentrations likely to significantly contribute to the biological activity of ondansetron .
In vitro metabolism studies have shown that ondansetron is a substrate for human hepatic cytochrome P - 450 enzymes , including CYP1A2 , CYP2D6 , and CYP3A4 .
In terms of overall ondansetron turnover , CYP3A4 played the predominant role .
Because of the multiplicity of metabolic enzymes capable of metabolizing ondansetron , it is likely that inhibition or loss of one enzyme ( e . g . , CYP2D6 genetic deficiency ) will be compensated by others and may result in little change in overall rates of ondansetron elimination .
Ondansetron elimination may be affected by cytochrome P - 450 inducers .
In a pharmacokinetic study of 16 epileptic patients maintained chronically on CYP3A4 inducers , carbamazepine , or phenytoin , reduction in AUC , Cmax , and T1 / 2 of ondansetron was observed . 1 This resulted in a significant increase in clearance .
However , on the basis of available data , no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended ( see PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions ) .
In humans , carmustine , etoposide , and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron .
In normal adult volunteers , the following mean pharmacokinetic data have been determined following a single 0 . 15 - mg / kg I . V . dose .
Table 1 .

In clinical trials with cancer patients , safety and efficacy were similar in patients over 65 years of age and those under 65 years of age ; there was an insufficient number of patients over 75 years of age to permit conclusions in that age - group .
No dosage adjustment is recommended in the elderly .
In patients with mild - to - moderate hepatic impairment , clearance is reduced 2 - fold and mean half - life is increased to 11 . 6 hours compared to 5 . 7 hours in normals .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh2 score of 10 or greater ) , clearance is reduced 2 - fold to 3 - fold and apparent volume of distribution is increased with a resultant increase in half - life to 20 hours .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , a total daily dose of 8 mg should not be exceeded .
Due to the very small contribution ( 5 % ) of renal clearance to the overall clearance , renal impairment was not expected to significantly influence the total clearance of ondansetron .
However , ondansetron mean plasma clearance was reduced by about 41 % in patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min ) .
This reduction in clearance is variable and was not consistent with an increase in half - life .
No reduction in dose or dosing frequency in these patients is warranted .
In adult cancer patients , the mean elimination half - life was 4 hours , and there was no difference in the multidose pharmacokinetics over a 4 - day period .
In a study of 21 pediatric cancer patients ( 4 to 18 years of age ) who received three I . V . doses of 0 . 15 mg / kg of ondansetron at 4 - hour intervals , patients older than 15 years of age exhibited ondansetron pharmacokinetic parameters similar to those of adults .
Patients 4 to 12 years of age generally showed higher clearance and somewhat larger volume of distribution than adults .
Most pediatric patients younger than 15 years of age with cancer had a shorter ( 2 . 4 hours ) ondansetron plasma half - life than patients older than 15 years of age .
It is not known whether these differences in ondansetron plasma half - life may result in differences in efficacy between adults and some young pediatric patients ( see CLINICAL TRIALS : Pediatric Studies ) .
Pharmacokinetic information for pediatric cancer patients 6 months to 48 months of age is approved for GlaxoSmithKline Corporation ’ s ondansetron injection .
However , due to GlaxoSmithKline ’ s marketing exclusivity rights , this drug product is not labeled for use in this subpopulation of pediatric patients .
In a study of 21 pediatric patients ( 3 to 12 years of age ) who were undergoing surgery requiring anesthesia for a duration of 45 minutes to 2 hours , a single I . V . dose of ondansetron , 2 mg ( 3 to 7 years ) or 4 mg ( 8 to 12 years ) , was administered immediately prior to anesthesia induction .
Mean weight - normalized clearance and volume of distribution values in these pediatric surgical patients were similar to those previously reported for young adults .
Mean terminal half - life was slightly reduced in pediatric patients ( range , 2 . 5 to 3 hours ) in comparison with adults ( range , 3 to 3 . 5 hours ) .

In patients 1 month to 4 months of age , a longer half - life was observed due to the higher volume of distribution in this age group .
Pharmacokinetic information for pediatric surgical patients 1 month to 24 months of age is approved for GlaxoSmithKline Corporation ’ s ondansetron injection .
However , due to GlaxoSmithKline ’ s marketing exclusivity rights , this drug product is not labeled for use in this subpopulation of pediatric patients .
In normal volunteers ( 19 to 39 years old , n = 23 ) , the peak plasma concentration was 264 ng / mL following a single 32 - mg dose administered as a 15 - minute I . V . infusion .
The mean elimination half - life was 4 . 1 hours .
Systemic exposure to 32 mg of ondansetron was not proportional to dose as measured by comparing dose - normalized AUC values to an 8 - mg dose .
This is consistent with a small decrease in systemic clearance with increasing plasma concentrations .
A study was performed in normal volunteers ( n = 56 ) to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of a single 4 - mg dose administered as a 5 - minute infusion compared to a single intramuscular injection .
Systemic exposure as measured by mean AUC was equivalent , with values of 156 [ 95 % CI 136 , 180 ] and 161 [ 95 % CI 137 , 190 ] ng • h / mL for I . V . and I . M . groups , respectively .
Mean peak plasma concentrations were 42 . 9 [ 95 % CI 33 . 8 , 54 . 4 ] ng / mL at 10 minutes after I . V . infusion and 31 . 9 [ 95 % CI 26 . 3 , 38 . 6 ] ng / mL at 41 minutes after I . M . injection .
The mean elimination half - life was not affected by route of administration .
Plasma protein binding of ondansetron as measured in vitro was 70 % to 76 % , with binding constant over the pharmacologic concentration range ( 10 to 500 ng / mL ) .
Circulating drug also distributes into erythrocytes .
A positive lymphoblast transformation test to ondansetron has been reported , which suggests immunologic sensitivity to ondansetron .
CLINICAL TRIALS Chemotherapy - Induced Nausea and Vomiting : Adult Studies : In a double - blind study of three different dosing regimens of ondansetron injection , 0 . 015 mg / kg , 0 . 15 mg / kg , and 0 . 30 mg / kg , each given three times during the course of cancer chemotherapy , the 0 . 15 - mg / kg dosing regimen was more effective than the 0 . 015 - mg / kg dosing regimen .
The 0 . 30 - mg / kg dosing regimen was not shown to be more effective than the 0 . 15 - mg / kg dosing regimen .
Cisplatin - Based Chemotherapy : In a double - blind study in 28 patients , ondansetron injection ( three 0 . 15 - mg / kg doses ) was significantly more effective than placebo in preventing nausea and vomiting induced by cisplatin - based chemotherapy .
Treatment response was as shown in Table 3 .

Ondansetron was compared with metoclopramide in a single - blind trial in 307 patients receiving cisplatin > 100 mg / m2 with or without other chemotherapeutic agents .
Patients received the first dose of ondansetron or metoclopramide 30 minutes before cisplatin .
Two additional ondansetron doses were administered 4 and 8 hours later , or five additional metoclopramide doses were administered 2 , 4 , 7 , 10 , and 13 hours later .
Cisplatin was administered over a period of 3 hours or less .
Episodes of vomiting and retching were tabulated over the period of 24 hours after cisplatin .
The results of this study are summarized in Table 4 .

In a stratified , randomized , double - blind , parallel - group , multicenter study , a single 32 - mg dose of ondansetron was compared with three 0 . 15 - mg / kg doses in patients receiving cisplatin doses of either 50 to 70 mg / m2 or > 100 mg / m2 .
Patients received the first ondansetron dose 30 minutes before cisplatin .
Two additional ondansetron doses were administered 4 and 8 hours later to the group receiving three 0 . 15 - mg / kg doses .
In both strata , significantly fewer patients on the single 32 - mg dose than those receiving the three - dose regimen failed .

Re - treatment : In uncontrolled trials , 127 patients receiving cisplatin ( median dose , 100 mg / m2 ) and ondansetron who had two or fewer emetic episodes were re - treated with ondansetron and chemotherapy , mainly cisplatin , for a total of 269 re - treatment courses ( median , 2 ; range , 1 to 10 ) .
No emetic episodes occurred in 160 ( 59 % ) , and two or fewer emetic episodes occurred in 217 ( 81 % ) re - treatment courses .
Pediatric Studies : Four open - label , noncomparative ( one US , three foreign ) trials have been performed with 209 pediatric cancer patients 4 to 18 years of age given a variety of cisplatin or noncisplatin regimens .
In the three foreign trials , the initial ondansetron injection dose ranged from 0 . 04 to 0 . 87 mg / kg for a total dose of 2 . 16 to 12 mg .
This was followed by the oral administration of ondansetron ranging from 4 to 24 mg daily for 3 days .
In the US trial , ondansetron injection was administered intravenously ( only ) in three doses of 0 . 15 mg / kg each for a total daily dose of 7 . 2 to 39 mg .
In these studies , 58 % of the 196 evaluable patients had a complete response ( no emetic episodes ) on day 1 .
Thus , prevention of vomiting in these pediatric patients was essentially the same as for patients older than 18 years of age .
Clinical trial information in pediatric cancer patients 6 months to 48 months of age is approved for GlaxoSmithKline Corporation ’ s ondansetron injection .
However , due to GlaxoSmithKline ’ s marketing exclusivity rights , this drug product is not labeled for use in this subpopulation of pediatric patients .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE • Prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy , including high - dose cisplatin .
Efficacy of the 32 - mg single dose beyond 24 hours in these patients has not been established .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Ondansetron in 5 % Dextrose Injection is contraindicated for patients known to have hypersensitivity to the drug .
WARNINGS Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients who have exhibited hypersensitivity to other selective 5 - HT3 receptor antagonists .
PRECAUTIONS General Ondansetron is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis .
It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction .
The use of ondansetron in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy - induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and / or gastric distention .
Rarely and predominantly with intravenous ondansetron , transient ECG changes including QT interval prolongation have been reported .
Drug Interactions : Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P - 450 drug - metabolizing enzyme system of the liver ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pharmacokinetics ) .
Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P - 450 drug - metabolizing enzymes ( CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 , CYP1A2 ) , inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and , hence , the half - life of ondansetron .
On the basis of limited available data , no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs .
Phenytoin , Carbamazepine , and Rifampicin : In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 ( i . e . , phenytoin , carbamazepine , and rifampicin ) , the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased .
However , on the basis of available data , no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs . 1 , 3 Tramadol : Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed , data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol . 4 , 5 Chemotherapy : Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P 388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron .
In humans , carmustine , etoposide , and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron .
In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients , I . V . ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high - dose methotrexate .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Carcinogenic effects were not seen in 2 - year studies in rats and mice with oral ondansetron doses up to 10 and 30 mg / kg per day , respectively .
Ondansetron was not mutagenic in standard tests for mutagenicity .
Oral administration of ondansetron up to 15 mg / kg per day did not affect fertility or general reproductive performance of male and female rats .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category B . Reproduction studies have been performed in pregnant rats and rabbits at I . V . doses up to 4 mg / kg per day and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to ondansetron .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers : Ondansetron is excreted in the breast milk of rats .
It is not known whether ondansetron is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when ondansetron is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use : Little information is available about the use of ondansetron in pediatric surgical patients younger than 1 month of age .
Little information is available about the use of ondansetron in pediatric cancer patients younger than 6 months of age .
The clearance of ondansetron in pediatric patients 1 month to 4 months of age is slower and the half - life is ~ 2 . 5 fold longer than patients who are > 4 to 24 months of age .
As a precaution , it is recommended that patients less than 4 months of age receiving this drug be closely monitored .
( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pharmacokinetics ) .
The frequency and type of adverse events reported in pediatric patients receiving ondansetron were similar to those in patients receiving placebo .
Geriatric Use : Of the total number of subjects enrolled in cancer chemotherapy - induced and postoperative nausea and vomiting in US - and foreign - controlled clinical trials , 862 were 65 years of age and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
Dosage adjustment is not needed in patients over the age of 65 ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ) .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Chemotherapy - Induced Nausea and Vomiting : The adverse events in Table 7 have been reported in adults receiving ondansetron at a dosage of three 0 . 15 - mg / kg doses or as a single 32 - mg dose in clinical trials .
These patients were receiving concomitant chemotherapy , primarily cisplatin , and I . V . fluids .
Most were receiving a diuretic .

In many cases , the relationship to ondansetron injection was unclear .
Gastrointestinal : Constipation has been reported in 11 % of chemotherapy patients receiving multiday ondansetron .
Hepatic : In comparative trials in cisplatin chemotherapy patients with normal baseline values of aspartate transaminase ( AST ) and alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , these enzymes have been reported to exceed twice the upper limit of normal in approximately 5 % of patients .
The increases were transient and did not appear to be related to dose or duration of therapy .
On repeat exposure , similar transient elevations in transaminase values occurred in some courses , but symptomatic hepatic disease did not occur .
Integumentary : Rash has occurred in approximately 1 % of patients receiving ondansetron .
Neurological : There have been rare reports consistent with , but not diagnostic of , extrapyramidal reactions in patients receiving ondansetron injection , and rare cases of grand mal seizure .
The relationship to ondansetron injection was unclear .
Other : Rare cases of hypokalemia have been reported .
The relationship to ondansetron injection was unclear .
Observed During Clinical Practice : In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials , the following events have been identified during post - approval use of intravenous formulations of ondansetron injection .
Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , estimates of frequency cannot be made .
The events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness , frequency of reporting , or potential causal connection to ondansetron injection .
Cardiovascular : Arrhythmias ( including ventricular and supraventricular tachycardia , premature ventricular contractions , and atrial fibrillation ) , bradycardia , electrocardiographic alterations ( including second - degree heart block , QT interval prolongation and ST segment depression ) , palpitations , and syncope .
General : Flushing .
Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions , sometimes severe ( e . g . , anaphylaxis / anaphylactoid reactions , angioedema , bronchospasm , cardiopulmonary arrest , hypotension , laryngeal edema , laryngospasm , shock , shortness of breath , stridor ) have also been reported .
Hepatobiliary : Liver enzyme abnormalities have been reported .
Liver failure and death have been reported in patients with cancer receiving concurrent medications including potentially hepatotoxic cytotoxic chemotherapy and antibiotics .
The etiology of the liver failure is unclear .
Local Reactions : Pain , redness , and burning at site of injection .
Lower Respiratory : Hiccups Neurological : Oculogyric crisis , appearing alone , as well as with other dystonic reactions .
Skin : Urticaria Special Senses : Transient dizziness during or shortly after I . V . infusion .
Eye Disorders : Transient blurred vision , in some cases associated with abnormalities of accommodation .
Cases of transient blindness , predominantly during intravenous administration , have been reported .
These cases of transient blindness were reported to resolve within a few minutes up to 48 hours .
DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Animal studies have shown that ondansetron is not discriminated as a benzodiazepine nor does it substitute for benzodiazepines in direct addiction studies .
OVERDOSAGE There is no specific antidote for ondansetron overdose .
Patients should be managed with appropriate supportive therapy .
Individual doses as large as 150 mg and total daily dosages ( three doses ) as large as 252 mg have been administered intravenously without significant adverse events .
These doses are more than 10 times the recommended daily dose .
In addition to the adverse events listed above , the following events have been described in the setting of ondansetron overdose : " Sudden blindness " ( amaurosis ) of 2 to 3 minutes ' duration plus severe constipation occurred in one patient that was administered 72 mg of ondansetron intravenously as a single dose .
Hypotension ( and faintness ) occurred in another patient that took 48 mg of oral ondansetron .
Following infusion of 32 mg over only a 4 - minute period , a vasovagal episode with transient second - degree heart block was observed .
In all instances , the events resolved completely .
