A total of 2141 subjects with acne vulgaris , 12 years and older , were treated once daily for 12 weeks .
Of these , 1068 were exposed to DIFFERIN Lotion during the clinical trials .
A total of 1057 subjects completed at least one post treatment evaluation .
Related adverse reactions that were reported in at least 1 % of patients treated with DIFFERIN Lotion or with the Vehicle Lotion are presented in Table 1 .
The majority of cases was transient , mild to moderate in severity and was managed with moisturizers .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant use of topical products with a strong drying effect can increase skin irritation .
Use with caution , especially in using preparations containing sulfur , resorcinol , or salicylic acid in combination with DIFFERIN Lotion .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Concomitant Topical Medications Concomitant topical acne therapy should be used with caution because a possible cumulative irritancy effect may occur , especially with the use of peeling , desquamating , or abrasive agents .
Caution should be exercised in using preparation containing sulfur , resorcinol or salicylic acid in combination with DIFFERIN Lotion .
No formal drug - drug interaction studies were conducted with DIFFERIN Lotion .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C .
There are no well - controlled trials in pregnant women treated with DIFFERIN Lotion .
Therefore , DIFFERIN Lotion should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with DIFFERIN Lotion .
Furthermore , such studies are not always predictive of human response .
Human Data In clinical trials involving DIFFERIN Lotion , 0 . 1 % in the treatment of acne vulgaris , women of childbearing potential initiated treatment only after a negative pregnancy test .
Two women became pregnant while using DIFFERIN Lotion , 0 . 1 % .
One patient delivered a healthy full term baby and the other patient electively terminated her pregnancy .
Animal Data No teratogenic effects were observed in rats treated with oral doses of 0 . 15 to 5 . 0 mg adapalene / kg / day , up to 25 times ( mg / m2 / day ) the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 2 grams of DIFFERIN Lotion .
However , teratogenic changes were observed in rats and rabbits when treated with oral doses of ≥ 25 mg adapalene / kg / day representing 123 and 246 times MRHD , respectively .
Findings included cleft palate , microphthalmia , encephalocele and skeletal abnormalities in rats ; and umbilical hernia , exophthalmos and kidney and skeletal abnormalities in rabbits .
Dermal teratology studies conducted in rats and rabbits at doses of 0 . 6 - 6 . 0 mg adapalene / kg / day [ 25 - 59 times ( mg / m2 ) the MRHD ] exhibited no fetotoxicity and only minimal increases in supernumerary ribs in both species and delayed ossification in rabbits .
Systemic exposure ( AUC 0 - 24 h ) to adapalene at topical doses ( 6 . 0 mg / kg / day ) in rats represented 101 times the exposure to adapalene in patients with acne treated with DIFFERIN Lotion applied to the face , chest and back ( 2 grams applied to 1000 cm ² of acne - involved skin ) .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether adapalene is excreted in human milk following use of DIFFERIN Lotion .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when DIFFERIN Lotion is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of DIFFERIN Lotion in pediatric patients under the age of 12 have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of DIFFERIN Lotion did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
11 DESCRIPTION DIFFERIN ( adapalene ) Lotion , 0 . 1 % for topical use , is an adapalene - based product .
Adapalene is a naphthoic acid derivative with retinoid - like properties .
The chemical name for adapalene is ( 6 - [ 3 - ( 1 - adamantyl ) - 4 - meghoxyphenyl ] - 2 - naphthoic acid ) .
Adapalene has the following structural formula : Adapalene : [ MULTIMEDIA ] DIFFERIN Lotion contains the following inactive ingredients : carbomer 941 , disodium edetate , medium chain triglycerides , methylparaben , phenoxyethanol , poloxamer 124 , polyoxyl - 6 - polyoxyl - 32 palmitostearate , PPG - 12 / SMDI copolymer , propylene glycol , propylparaben , sodium hydroxide , stearyl alcohol , and purified water .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Adapalene binds to specific retinoic acid nuclear receptors but does not bind to cytosolic receptor protein .
Biochemical and pharmacological profile studies have demonstrated that adapalene is a modulator of cellular differentiation , keratinization and inflammatory processes .
However , the significance of these findings with regard to the mechanism of action of adapalene for the treatment of acne is unknown .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamics of DIFFERIN Lotion is unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic exposure of adapalene following a topical application of DIFFERIN Lotion was studied in one clinical study .
Fourteen subjects at 18 - 29 years of age with severe acne were treated with 2 g of DIFFERIN Lotion once daily for 30 days to approximately 1000 cm2 of acne involved skin .
Serial plasma samples were collected for 24 or 72 hours following application on days 1 , 15 and 30 .
All plasma concentrations for 12 out of 14 patients were below the limit of quantification ( LOQ = 0 . 1 ng / mL ) .
One patient had one sample above LOQ at day 30 and the other patient had four plasma samples above LOQ on both days 1 and 15 , which ranged from 0 . 102 and 0 . 131 ng / mL .
Due to the limited number of available data points , PK analysis was not undertaken .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No carcinogenicity , mutagenicity and impairment of fertility studies were conducted with DIFFERIN Lotion .
Carcinogenicity studies with adapalene have been conducted in mice at topical doses of 0 . 4 , 1 . 3 , and 4 . 0 mg / kg / day ( 1 . 2 , 3 . 9 , and 12 mg / m2 / day ) , and in rats at oral doses of 0 . 15 , 0 . 5 , and 1 . 5 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 9 , 3 . 0 , and 9 . 0 mg / m2 / day ) .
In terms of body surface area , the highest dose levels are 9 . 8 ( mice ) and 7 . 4 times ( rats ) the MRHD of 2 grams of DIFFERIN Lotion .
In the rat study , an increased incidence of benign and malignant pheochromocytomas in the adrenal medulla of male rats was observed .
No photocarcinogenicity studies were conducted with adapalene .
However , animal studies have shown an increased tumorigenic risk with the use of pharmacologically similar drugs ( e . g . retinoids ) when exposed to UV irradiation in the laboratory or sunlight .
Although the significance of these findings to humans is not clear , patients should be advised to avoid or minimize exposure to either sunlight or artificial irradiation sources .
Adapalene did not exhibit mutagenic or genotoxic effects in vitro ( Ames test , Chinese hamster ovary cell assay , mouse lymphoma TK assay ) or in vivo ( mouse micronucleus test ) .
In rat oral studies , 20 mg adapalene / kg / day ( 120 mg / m2 / day ; 98 times the MRHD based on mg / m2 / day comparison ) did not affect the reproductive performance and fertility of F0 males and females , or growth , development and reproductive function of F1 offspring .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of DIFFERIN Lotion applied once daily for the treatment of acne vulgaris were assessed in two 12 - week , multicenter , controlled clinical studies of similar design , comparing DIFFERIN Lotion to the Lotion vehicle in acne subjects .
In Study 1 , 1075 subjects were randomized to DIFFERIN Lotion or vehicle .
The median age of these subjects was 16 . 7 years old and 53 . 1 % were females .
At baseline subjects had between 20 to 50 inflammatory lesions and 30 to 100 non - inflammatory lesions .
The majority of subjects ( 91 . 0 % ) had a baseline IGA score of ‘ Moderate ’ .
In Study 2 , 1066 subjects were randomized to DIFFERIN Lotion or vehicle .
The median age of subjects was 16 . 7 years old and 53 . 7 % were females .
At baseline subjects had the same inclusion criteria as in Study 1 and 95 . 7 % of subjects had a baseline IGA score of ‘ Moderate ’ .
The outcome of the two studies is presented in Table 3 .
