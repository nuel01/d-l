1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Miglustat is a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor indicated as monotherapy for treatment of adult patients with mild / moderate type 1 Gaucher disease for whom enzyme replacement therapy is not a therapeutic option ( 1 . 1 ) .
1 . 1 Type 1 Gaucher Disease Miglustat is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease for whom enzyme replacement therapy is not a therapeutic option ( e . g . due to allergy , hypersensitivity , or poor venous access ) .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Recommended dosage is 100 mg administered orally three times a day at regular intervals ( 2 . 1 ) .
• May reduce dosage to 100 mg once or twice a day in some patients due to tremor or diarrhea ( 2 . 1 ) .
• Adjust in patients with renal impairment ( 2 . 2 ) : Renal Impairment Adjusted Creatinine Clearance ( in mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) Recommendations Mild 50 – 70 Start dose at 100 mg twice a day Moderate 30 – 50 Start dose at 100 mg once a day Severe < 30 Use is not recommended 2 . 1 Instructions for Administration Therapy should be directed by physicians who are knowledgeable in the management of Gaucher disease .
The recommended dose for the treatment of adult patients with type 1 Gaucher disease is one 100 mg capsule administered orally three times a day at regular intervals .
If a dose is missed , the next miglustat capsule should be taken at the next scheduled time .
It may be necessary to reduce the dose to one 100 mg capsule once or twice a day in some patients due to adverse reactions , such as tremor or diarrhea .
2 . 2 Patients with Renal Insufficiency In patients with mild renal impairment ( adjusted creatinine clearance 50 – 70 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , initiate miglustat treatment at a dose of 100 mg twice per day .
In patients with moderate renal impairment ( adjusted creatinine clearance of 30 – 50 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , initiate miglustat treatment at a dose of one 100 mg capsule per day .
Miglustat is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Capsules : 100 mg of miglustat , white opaque hard gelatin capsules with " OGT 918 " printed in black on the cap and " 100 " printed in black on the body .
Capsules : 100 mg ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None .
None ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Peripheral neuropathy : Perform baseline and follow - up neurological evaluations at 6 - month intervals in all patients ( 5 . 1 ) .
• Tremor : Reduce dose to ameliorate tremor or discontinue treatment if tremor does not resolve within days of dose reduction ( 5 . 2 ) .
• Diarrhea and weight loss : Evaluate for underlying gastrointestinal disease in patients who do not respond to usual interventions ( e . g . diet modification ) ( 5 . 3 ) .
• Reductions in Platelet Count : Mild reductions in platelet counts without association with bleeding were observed in some patients .
Monitoring of platelet counts is recommended ( 5 . 4 ) .
5 . 1 Peripheral Neuropathy In clinical trials , cases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported in 3 % of Gaucher ' s patients treated with miglustat .
All patients receiving miglustat treatment should undergo baseline and repeat neurological evaluations at approximately 6 - month intervals .
Patients who develop symptoms of peripheral neuropathy such as pain , weakness , numbness and tingling should have a careful re - assessment of the risk / benefit of miglustat therapy , and cessation of treatment may be considered .
5 . 2 Tremor Approximately 30 % of patients have reported tremor or exacerbation of existing tremor on treatment .
These tremors were described as an exaggerated physiological tremor of the hands .
Tremor usually began within the first month of therapy and in many cases resolved between 1 to 3 months during treatment .
Reduce dose to ameliorate tremor or discontinue treatment if tremor does not resolve within days of dose reduction .
5 . 3 Diarrhea and Weight Loss Diarrhea and weight loss were common in clinical studies of patients treated with miglustat , occurring in approximately 85 % and up to 65 % of treated patients , respectively .
Diarrhea appears to be the result of the inhibitory activity of miglustat on intestinal disaccharidases such as sucrase - isomaltase in the gastrointestinal tract leading to reduced absorption of dietary disaccharides in the small intestine , with a resultant osmotic diarrhea .
It is unclear if weight loss results from the diarrhea and associated gastrointestinal complaints , a decrease in food intake , or a combination of these or other factors .
The incidence of weight loss was most evident in the first 12 months of treatment .
Diarrhea decreased over time with continued miglustat treatment , and may respond to individualized diet modification ( e . g . , reduction of sucrose , lactose and other carbohydrate intake ) , to taking miglustat between meals , and / or to anti - diarrheal medications , most commonly loperamide .
Patients may be instructed to avoid high carbohydrate content foods during treatment with miglustat if they present with diarrhea .
Patients with persistent gastrointestinal events that continue during treatment with miglustat , and who do not respond to usual interventions ( e . g . diet modification ) , should be evaluated to determine whether significant underlying gastrointestinal disease is present .
The safety of treatment with miglustat has not been evaluated in patients with significant gastrointestinal disease , such as inflammatory bowel disease , and continued treatment of these patients with miglustat should occur only after consideration of the risks and benefits of continued treatment .
5 . 4 Reductions in Platelet Count In clinical trials evaluating the use of miglustat for treatment of indications other than type 1 Gaucher disease , mild reductions in platelet counts without association with bleeding were observed in some patients ; approximately 40 % of patients in this trial had low platelet counts ( defined as below 150 × 109 / L ) before starting treatment with miglustat .
Monitoring of platelet counts is recommended in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease .
Mild reductions in platelet counts without association with bleeding were observed in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease who were switched from enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) to miglustat .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The data described below reflect exposure of 80 patients with type 1 Gaucher disease in two open - label , uncontrolled , monotherapy trials , one open - label , active - controlled trial , and two extensions , who received miglustat at doses ranging from 50 mg to 200 mg three times daily .
Patients were aged 18 to 69 years at first treatment .
The population was evenly distributed by gender .
The most common serious adverse reaction reported with miglustat treatment in clinical trials was peripheral neuropathy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients treated with miglustat ( occurring in ≥ 5 % ) that were considered related to miglustat are shown in Tables 1 and 2 [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 3 ) ] .
The most common adverse reactions requiring intervention were diarrhea and tremor [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 3 ) ] .
In two open - label , uncontrolled monotherapy trials , adult type 1 Gaucher disease patients were treated with miglustat at a starting dose of 100 mg three times daily ( dose range 100 to 200 mg three times daily ) for up to 12 months in 28 patients [ Study 1 ] , or at a dose of 50 mg three times daily for up to 6 months in 18 patients [ Study 2 ] .
Table 1 below lists adverse reactions that occurred during the trials in ≥ 5 % of patients .
Table 1 : Adverse Reactions in ≥ 5 % of Patients in Two Open - Label , Uncontrolled Monotherapy Trials of miglustat Incidence of adverse reactions Study 1 ( starting dose 100 mg three times daily ) Study 2 ( 50 mg three times daily ) Patients entered in Study ( n ) 28 18 Body System - Preferred Term % of patients reporting % of patients reporting Gastrointestinal System Diarrhea 89 89 Flatulence 29 44 Abdominal Pain 18 50 Nausea 14 22 Vomiting 4 11 Bloating 0 6 Anorexia 7 0 Dyspepsia 7 0 Epigastric pain not food - related 0 6 Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders Weight Decrease 39 67 Central and Peripheral Nervous System Headache 21 22 Tremor 11 11 Dizziness 0 11 Leg cramps 4 11 Paresthesia 7 0 Migraine 0 6 Vision Disorders Visual Disturbance 0 17 Musculoskeletal Disorders Cramps 0 11 Platelet , Bleeding , and Clotting Disorders Thrombocytopenia 7 6 Reproductive disorders , female Menstrual disorder 0 6 In an open - label , active - controlled study , 36 adult type 1 Gaucher disease patients were treated with miglustat , imiglucerase , or miglustat plus imiglucerase [ Study 3 ] for up to 12 months .
Table 2 lists adverse reactions that occurred during the trial in ≥ 5 % of patients .
Table 2 : Adverse Reactions in ≥ 5 % of Patients in Open - Label Active Controlled Study Incidence of adverse reactions Miglustat alone Imiglucerase alone Patients entered in Study ( n ) 12 12 Body System - Preferred Term % of patients reporting % of patients reporting Gastrointestinal System Diarrhea 100 0 Abdominal Pain 67 0 Flatulence 50 0 Constipation 8 0 Nausea 8 0 Dry Mouth 8 0 Body as a Whole Pain 0 8 Generalized weakness 17 0 Abdominal distension 8 0 Back pain 8 0 Heaviness in limbs 8 0 Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders Weight Decrease 67 0 Central and Peripheral Nervous System Tremor 17 0 Dizziness 8 0 Leg cramps 8 0 Unsteady gait 8 0 Psychiatric disorders Memory loss 8 0 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS While co - administration of miglustat appeared to increase the clearance of imiglucerase by 70 % , these results are not conclusive because of the small number of patients studied and because patients took variable doses of imiglucerase [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Co - administration of miglustat and imiglucerase may lead to increased clearance of imiglucerase ( 7 ) .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Based on animal data , may cause fetal harm ( 8 . 1 ) .
• Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8 . 2 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal reproduction studies , miglustat may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Available data from postmarketing case reports with miglustat use in pregnancy are insufficient to assess a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
There are risks associated with symptomatic Type I Gaucher disease in pregnancy , including hepatosplenomegaly and thrombocytopenia ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risks to the fetus .
In animal reproduction studies , miglustat was maternally toxic in rabbits at exposures near the expected human therapeutic dose and caused embryo - fetal toxicities in rats at doses twice the recommended human dose .
No adverse developmental outcomes were observed with administration of miglustat to pregnant rats at dose levels 6 times the recommended human dose .
( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 – 4 % and 15 – 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated Maternal and Embryo - Fetal Risk Pregnancy may exacerbate existing Type 1 Gaucher disease symptoms or result in new disease manifestations .
Type 1 Gaucher disease manifestations may lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes including , hepatosplenomegaly which can interfere with the normal growth of a pregnancy and thrombocytopenia which can lead to increased bleeding and possible hemorrhage .
Data Animal Data In female rats given miglustat by oral gavage at doses of 20 , 60 , 180 mg / kg / day beginning 14 days before mating and continuing through gestation day 17 ( organogenesis ) , increased post implantation loss , decreased embryo - fetal survival and decreased fetal and pup weights were observed at doses ≥ 60 mg / kg / day ( ≥ 2 times the human therapeutic dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Miglustat was also administered to pregnant rats by oral gavage at doses of 20 , 60 , 180 mg / kg / day from gestation day 6 through lactation ( postpartum day 20 ) .
Delayed and prolonged parturition with decreased live births were observed at doses ≥ 60 mg / kg / day ( ≥ 2 times the human therapeutic dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
In pregnant rabbits given miglustat by oral gavage at doses of 15 , 30 , 45 mg / kg / day during gestation days 6 – 18 ( organogenesis ) , maternal toxicity , including maternal deaths ( all doses ) , reduced food consumption ( 30 and 45 mg / kg / day ) , and decreased body weight gain ( 15 and 30 mg / kg / day ) , was observed .
The 15 mg / kg / day dose level was 0 . 97 times the human therapeutic dose on a mg / m2 basis .
In a pre - and postnatal development study in rats , miglustat was administered by oral gavage at doses of 20 , 60 , 180 mg / kg / day from gestation day 6 through day 20 of lactation , decreased live births were observed in dams , as well as decreased body weight gain in the offspring at doses ≥ 60 mg / kg / day ( ≥ 2 times the human therapeutic dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
There was no effect on behavioral and learning assessments , sexual maturation or reproductive performance of the offspring at doses up to 180 mg / kg / day ( about 6 times the human therapeutic dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no available data on the presence of miglustat in either human or animal milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Based on the physical properties of miglustat , miglustat is likely to be present in breast milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants , advise women that breastfeeding is not recommended .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Findings from a small clinical study in seven healthy adult males who received miglustat for six weeks did not indicate effects on male fertility .
Studies in male rats have shown that miglustat decreased fertility but findings were reversible .
Studies in female rats have shown increased post - implantation loss and decreased embryo - fetal survival [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of miglustat in pediatric patients have not been established .
In a combined clinical trial safety data set of 45 patients less than 18 years of age exposed to miglustat in indications other than type 1 Gaucher disease , the median weight and height percentiles adjusted for age and gender decreased during the first year of treatment but then stabilized .
The mean length of exposure in these studies ranged from 2 to 2 . 6 years ; some pediatric patients were exposed for up to 4 years .
However , the effect of miglustat on long - term gain in weight and height in pediatric patients is unclear .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of miglustat did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , and cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Miglustat is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In patients with mild renal impairment ( adjusted creatinine clearance 50 – 70 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , miglustat administration should commence at a dose of 100 mg twice per day .
In patients with moderate renal impairment ( adjusted creatinine clearance of 30 – 50 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , miglustat administration should commence at a dose of 100 mg once a day .
Use of miglustat in patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) is not recommended .
Since elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
The impact of hemodialysis on the disposition of miglustat has not been investigated .
11 DESCRIPTION Miglustat ( miglustat capsules , 100 mg ) is a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor , which is a glucosyl transferase enzyme responsible for the first step in the synthesis of most glycosphingolipids .
miglustat is an N - alkylated imino sugar , a synthetic analog of D - glucose .
The chemical name for miglustat is 1 , 5 - ( butylimino ) - 1 , 5 - dideoxy - D - glucitol with the chemical formula C10H21NO4 and a molecular weight of 219 . 28 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Miglustat is a white to off - white crystalline solid and has a bitter taste .
It is highly soluble in water ( > 1000 mg / mL as a free base ) .
Miglustat is supplied in hard gelatin capsules each containing 100 mg miglustat for oral administration .
Each miglustat 100 mg capsule also contains magnesium stearate , povidone ( K30 ) , and sodium starch glycolate .
Ingredients in the capsule shell include gelatin and titanium dioxide , and the shells are printed with edible ink consisting of black iron oxide and shellac .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Type 1 Gaucher disease is caused by a functional deficiency of glucocerebrosidase , the enzyme that mediates the degradation of the glycosphingolipid glucosylceramide .
Miglustat functions as a competitive and reversible inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase , the initial enzyme in a series of reactions which results in the synthesis of most glycosphingolipids .
miglustat helps reduce the rate of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis so that the amount of glycosphingolipid substrate is reduced to a level which allows the residual activity of the deficient glucocerebrosidase enzyme to be more effective ( substrate reduction therapy ) .
In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that miglustat can reduce the synthesis of glucosylceramide - based glycosphingolipids .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After a 100 mg oral dose , the time to maximum observed plasma concentration of miglustat ( tmax ) ranged from 2 to 2 . 5 hours in Gaucher patients .
Plasma concentrations show a biexponential decline , characterized by a short distribution phase and a longer elimination phase .
The effective half - life of miglustat is approximately 6 to 7 hours , which predicts that steady - state will be achieved by 1 . 5 to 2 days following the start of three times daily dosing .
Miglustat , dosed at 50 and 100 mg three times daily in Gaucher patients , exhibits dose - proportional pharmacokinetics .
The pharmacokinetics of miglustat were not altered after repeated dosing three times daily for up to 12 months .
In healthy subjects , co - administration of miglustat with food results in a decrease in the rate of absorption of miglustat ( maximum plasma concentration [ Cmax ] was decreased by 36 % and tmax delayed 2 h ) but had no statistically significant effect on the extent of absorption of miglustat ( area - under - the - plasma - concentration time curve [ AUC ] was decreased by 14 % ) .
The mean oral bioavailability of a 100 - mg miglustat capsule is about 97 % relative to an oral solution administered under fasting conditions .
The pharmacokinetics of miglustat were similar between adult type 1 Gaucher disease patients and healthy subjects after a single dose administration of miglustat 100 mg .
Distribution Miglustat does not bind to plasma proteins .
Mean apparent volume of distribution of miglustat is 83 – 105 liters in Gaucher patients .
At steady state , the concentration of miglustat in cerebrospinal fluid of six non - Gaucher patients was 31 . 4 – 67 . 2 % of that in plasma , indicating that miglustat crosses the blood brain barrier .
Metabolism and Excretion The major route of excretion of miglustat is via kidney .
Following administration of a single dose of 100 mg 14 C - miglustat to healthy volunteers , 83 % of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and 12 % in feces .
In healthy subjects , 67 % of the administered dose was excreted unchanged in urine over 72 hours .
The most abundant metabolite in urine was miglustat glucuronide accounting for 5 % of the dose .
The terminal half - life of radioactivity in plasma was 150 hours , suggesting the presence of one or more metabolites with a prolonged half - life .
The metabolite accounting for this observation has not been identified , but may accumulate and reach concentrations exceeding those of miglustat at steady state .
Specific Populations Gender There was no statistically significant gender difference in miglustat pharmacokinetics , based on pooled data analysis .
Race Ethnic differences in miglustat pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated in Gaucher patients .
However , apparent oral clearance of miglustat in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent was not statistically different to that in others ( 1 Asian and 15 Caucasians ) , based on a cross - study analysis .
Hepatic Impairment No studies have been performed to assess the pharmacokinetics of miglustat in patients with hepatic impairment .
Renal Impairment Limited data in non - Gaucher patients with impaired renal function indicate that the apparent oral clearance ( CL / F ) of miglustat decreases with decreasing renal function .
While the number of subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment was very small , the data suggest an approximate decrease in the apparent oral clearance of 40 % and 60 % respectively , in mild and moderate renal impairment , justifying the need to decrease the dosing of miglustat in such patients dependent upon creatinine clearance levels [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Data in severe renal impairment are limited to two patients with creatinine clearances in the range 18 – 29 mL / min and cannot be extrapolated below this range .
These data suggest a decrease in CL / F by at least 70 % in patients with severe renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Drug Interaction Studies Miglustat does not inhibit the metabolism of various substrates of cytochrome P450 enzymes including , CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 , CYP3A4 and CYP4A11 in vitro ; consequently , significant interactions via inhibition of these enzymes are unlikely with drugs that are substrates of cytochrome P450 enzymes .
Drug interaction between miglustat ( miglustat 100 mg orally three times daily ) and imiglucerase 7 . 5 or 15 U / kg / day was assessed in imiglucerase - stabilized patients after one month of co - administration .
There was no significant effect of imiglucerase on the pharmacokinetics of miglustat , with the co - administration of imiglucerase and miglustat resulting in a 22 % reduction in Cmax and a 14 % reduction in the AUC for miglustat .
While miglustat appeared to increase the clearance of imiglucerase by 70 % , these results are not conclusive because of the small number of subjects studied and because patients took variable doses of imiglucerase [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Concomitant therapy with loperamide during clinical trials did not appear to significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of miglustat .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Two - year carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with miglustat in CD - 1 mice at oral doses up to 500 mg / kg / day and in Sprague Dawley rats at oral doses up to 180 mg / kg / day .
Oral administration of miglustat for 104 weeks produced mucinous adenocarcinomas of the large intestine at 210 , 420 and 500 mg / kg / day ( about 3 , 6 and 7 times the recommended human dose , respectively , based on the body surface area ) in male mice and at 420 and 500 mg / kg / day ( about 6 and 7 times the recommended human dose , based on the body surface area ) in female mice .
The adenocarcinomas were considered rare in CD - 1 mice and occurred in the presence of inflammatory and hyperplastic lesions in the large intestine of both males and females .
In rats , oral administration of miglustat for 100 weeks produced increased incidences of interstitial cell adenomas of the testis at 30 , 60 and 180 mg / kg / day ( about 1 , 2 and 5 times the recommended human dose , respectively , based on the body surface area ) .
Mutagenesis Miglustat was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including the bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) , chromosomal aberration ( in human lymphocytes ) , gene mutation in mammalian cells ( Chinese hamster ovary ) , and mouse micronucleus assays .
Impairment of Fertility Miglustat was administered by oral gavage to male rats at doses of 20 , 60 , 180 mg / kg / day beginning at least 14 days prior to mating and continuing through mating .
Effects on sperm parameters ( concentration , motility and morphology ) resulting in decreased fertility were observed at all dose levels ( the lowest dose level was 0 . 65 times the human therapeutic dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Reversibility was demonstrated following 6 weeks of drug withdrawal .
Findings of , seminiferous tubule degeneration and atrophy were observed in the testes in rat repeat - dose toxicity studies .
Miglustat was administered by oral gavage to female rats at doses of 20 , 60 , 180 mg / kg / day beginning 14 days before mating and continuing through gestation day 17 .
There were no effects on mating performance or fertility in female rats at doses up to 180 mg / kg / day .
However , increased post implantation loss and decreased embryo - fetal survival were observed at doses ≥ 60 mg / kg / day ( ≥ 2 times the human therapeutic dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Histopathology findings in the absence of clinical signs in the central nervous system of the monkey ( brain , spine ) that included vascular mineralization , in addition to mineralization and necrosis of white matter were observed at > 750 mg / kg / day ( 4 times the human therapeutic systemic exposure based on area - under - the - plasma - concentration curve [ AUC ] comparisons ) in a 52 - week oral toxicity study using doses of 750 and 2000 mg / kg / d .
Vacuolization of white matter was observed in rats dosed orally by gavage at ≥ 180 mg / kg / d ( 6 times the human therapeutic exposure based on surface area comparisons , mg / m2 ) in a 4 - week study using doses of 180 , 840 , and 4200 mg / kg / d .
Vacuolization can sometimes occur as an artifact of tissue processing .
Findings in dogs included tremor and absent corneal reflexes at 105 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the human therapeutic systemic exposure , based on body surface area comparisons , mg / m2 ) after a 4 - week oral gavage toxicity study using doses of 35 , 70 , 105 , and 140 mg / kg / d .
Ataxia , diminished / absent pupillary , palpebral , or patellar reflexes were observed in a dog at ≥ 495 mg / kg / day ( 50 times the human therapeutic systemic exposure based on body surface area comparisons , mg / m2 ) , in a 2 - week oral gavage toxicity study using doses of 85 , 165 , 495 , and 825 mg / kg / d .
Cataracts were observed in rats at ≥ 180 mg / kg / day ( 4 times the human therapeutic systemic exposure , based on AUC ) in a 52 - week oral gavage toxicity study using doses of 180 , 420 , 840 , and 1680 mg / kg / d .
Gastrointestinal necrosis , inflammation , and hemorrhage were observed in dogs at ≥ 85 mg / kg / day ( 9 times the human therapeutic systemic exposure based on body surface area comparisons , mg / m2 ) after a 2 - week oral ( capsule ) toxicity study using doses of 85 , 165 , 495 , and 825 mg / kg / d .
Similar GI toxicity occurred in rats at 1200 mg / kg / day ( 7 times the human therapeutic systemic exposure , based on AUC ) in a 26 - week oral gavage toxicity study using doses of 300 , 600 , and 1200 mg / kg / d .
In monkeys , similar GI toxicity occurred at ≥ 750 mg / kg / day ( 6 times the human therapeutic systemic exposure based on AUC ) following a 52 - week oral gavage toxicity study using doses of 750 and 2000 mg / kg / d .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of miglustat in type 1 Gaucher disease has been investigated in two open - label , uncontrolled trials and one randomized , open - label , active - controlled trial with enzyme replacement given as imiglucerase .
Patients who received miglustat were treated with doses ranging from 100 to 600 mg a day , although the majority of patients were maintained on doses between 200 to 300 mg a day .
Efficacy parameters included the evaluation of liver and spleen organ volume , hemoglobin concentration , and platelet count .
A total of 80 patients were exposed to miglustat during the three trials and their extension period .
Open - Label Uncontrolled Monotherapy Trials In Study 1 , miglustat was administered at a starting dose of 100 mg three times daily for 12 months ( dose range of 100 once - daily to 200 mg three times daily ) to 28 adult patients with type 1 Gaucher disease , who were unable to receive enzyme replacement therapy and who had not taken enzyme replacement therapy in the preceding 6 months .
Twenty - two patients completed the trial .
After 12 months of treatment , the results showed significant mean percent reductions from baseline in liver volume of 12 % and spleen volume of 19 % , a non - significant increase from baseline in mean absolute hemoglobin concentration of 0 . 26 g / dL and a mean absolute increase from baseline in platelet counts of 8 × 109 / L ( See Tables 3 – 6 ) .
In Study 2 , miglustat was administered at a dose of 50 mg three times daily for 6 months to 18 adult patients with type 1 Gaucher disease who were unable to receive enzyme replacement therapy and who had not taken enzyme replacement therapy in the preceding 6 months .
Seventeen patients completed the trial .
After 6 months of treatment , the results showed significant mean percent reductions from baseline in liver volume of 6 % and spleen volume of 5 % .
There was a non - significant mean absolute decrease from baseline in hemoglobin concentration of 0 . 13 g / dL and a non - significant mean absolute increase from baseline in platelet counts of 5 × 109 / L ( See Tables 3 – 6 ) .
Extension Period Eighteen patients were enrolled in a 12 - month extension to Study 1 .
A subset of patients continuing in the extension had larger mean baseline liver volumes , and lower mean baseline platelet counts and hemoglobin concentrations than the original study population ( See Tables 3 – 6 ) .
After a total of 24 months of treatment , there were significant mean decreases from baseline in liver and spleen organ volumes of 15 % and 27 % , respectively , and significant mean absolute increases from baseline in hemoglobin concentration and platelet count of 0 . 9 g / dL and 14 × 109 / L , respectively ( See Tables 3 – 6 ) .
Sixteen patients were enrolled in a 6 - month extension to Study 2 .

Patients were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to one of three treatment groups , as follows : • miglustat 100 mg three times daily alone • imiglucerase ( patient ' s usual dose ) alone • miglustat 100 mg three times daily and imiglucerase ( usual dose ) Patients were treated for 6 months , and 33 patients completed the study .
Because miglustat is only indicated as monotherapy , the results for the monotherapy arms are described below .
At Month 6 , the results showed a decrease in mean percent change in liver volume in the miglustat treatment group compared to the imiglucerase alone group .
There were no significant differences between the groups for mean absolute changes in liver and spleen volume and hemoglobin concentration .
However , there was a significant difference between the miglustat alone and imiglucerase alone groups in platelet counts at Month 6 , with the miglustat alone group having a mean absolute decrease in platelet count of 21 . 6 × 109 / L and the imiglucerase alone group having a mean absolute increase in platelet count of 10 . 1 × 109 / L ( See Tables 7 – 10 ) .
Extension period Twenty - nine patients were enrolled in a 6 - month extension to Study 3 .
In the extension phase , all 29 patients had withdrawn from imiglucerase and received open - label miglustat 100 mg three times daily monotherapy .
At Month 12 , the results showed non - significant decreases in platelet counts from baseline in all the treatment groups ( by original randomization ) .
There was a significant decrease in platelet counts from Month 6 to Month 12 in the group originally randomized to treatment with imiglucerase , and a continued decrease in platelet counts in the group originally randomized to miglustat alone .
There were no significant changes in any treatment group for liver volume , spleen volume , or hemoglobin concentration ( See Tables 7 – 10 ) .
