Ferrous fumarate ( 66 mg elemental iron ) USP ................... 200 mg Ascorbic acid USP ..................................................................
250 mg Desiccated stomach powder ...................................................
100 mg ( Contains : Intrinsic factor ) , Cyanocobalamin USP ............................................................... 10 mcg DISCUSSION : The amount of elemental iron and the absorption of the iron components of commercial iron preparations vary widely .
It is further established that certain " accessory components " may be included to enhance absorption and utilization of iron .
Hematogen ™ Capsules are formulated to provide the essential factors for a complete , versatile hematinic .
ACTIONS / CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY HIGH ELEMENTAL IRON CONTENT : Ferrous fumarate , used in Hematogen ™ Capsules , is an organic iron complex which has the highest elemental iron content of any hematinic salt - 33 % .
This compares with 20 % for ferrous sulfate ( heptahydrate ) and 13 % for ferrous gluconate .
Hematogen ™ contains 66 mg of elemental iron .
MORE COMPLETE ABSORPTION : It has been repeatedly shown that ascorbic acid , when given in sufficient amounts , can increase the absorption of ferrous iron from the gastrointestinal tract .
The absorption promoting effect is mainly due to the reducing action of ascorbic acid within the gastro intestinal lumen , which helps to prevent or delay the formation of insoluble or less dissociated ferric compounds .
Iron absorption has been shown to increase sharply with increasing amounts of ascorbic acid , showing a gain in absorption of approximately 40 % at 250 mg .
Above 250 mg , the gain becomes insignificant , with an additional gain of only approximately 8 % at 500 mg .
Each Hematogen ™ Capsule contains 250 mg of ascorbic acid , believed to be the optimal amount .
PROMOTES MOVEMENT OF PLASMA IRON : Ascorbic acid also plays an important role in the movement of plasma iron to storage depots in the tissues .
The action , which leads to the transport of plasma iron to ferritin , presumably involves its reducing effect ; converting transferrin iron from 5 the ferric to the ferrous state .
There is also evidence that ascorbic acid improves iron utilization , presumably as a further result of its reducing action , and some evidence that it may have a direct effect upon erythropoiesis .
Ascorbic acid is further alleged to enhance the conversion of folic acid to a more physiologically active form , folinic acid .
which would make it even more important in the 11 treatment of anemia since it would aid in the utilization of dietary folic acid .
EXCELLENT ORAL TOLERATION : Ferrous fumarate is used in Hematogen ™ Capsules because it is less likely to cause the gastric disturbances so often associated with oral iron therapy .
Ferrous fumarate has a low ionization constant and high solubility in the entire pH range of the gastrointestinal tract .
It does not precipitate proteins or have the astringency of more ionizable forms of iron , and does not interfere with proteolytic or diastatic activities of the digestive system .
Because of excellent oral toleration , Hematogen ™ Capsules can usually be administered between meals when iron absorption is maximal .
FACILITATES ABSORPTION OF VITAMIN B12 : It is now known that " Intrinsic Factor " is essential for the adequate alimentary absorption of vitamin B .
The inclusion of desiccated stomach powder 12 with oral vitamin B will furnish sufficient intrinsic factor to assure absorption of the vitamin 12 only TOXICITY : Ferrous fumarate was found to be the least toxic of three popular oral iron salts , with an oral LD50 of 630 mg / kg .
In the same report , the LD50 of ferrous gluconate was reported to be 320 mg / kg and ferrous sulfate 230 mg / kg .
INDICATIONS : For the treatment of all anemias responsive to oral iron therapy , such as hypochromic anemia associated with pregnancy , chronic or acute blood loss , dietary restriction , metabolic disease and post - surgical convalescence .
CONTRAINDICATIONS : Hemochromatosis and hemosiderosis are contraindications to iron therapy .
