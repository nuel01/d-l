Axumin is a radioactive diagnostic agent indicated for positron emission tomography ( PET ) imaging in men with suspected prostate cancer recurrence based on elevated blood prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) levels following prior treatment ( 1 ) .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Use appropriate radiation safety handling measures ( 2 . 1 ) .
• Aseptically withdraw Axumin from its container and administer 370 MBq ( 10 mCi ) as a bolus intravenous injection .
( 2 . 2 ) .
• Initiate imaging 3 minutes to 5 minutes after administration .
Scanning should start from mid - thigh and proceed to base of skull , with a total scan time of approximately 20 minutes to 30 minutes ( 2 . 4 ) .
• The ( radiation absorbed ) effective dose associated with 370 MBq ( 10 mCi ) of injected activity of Axumin is approximately 8 mSv ( 0 . 8 rem ) in an adult ( 2 . 6 ) .
2 . 1 Radiation Safety - Drug Handling Axumin is a radioactive drug and should be handled with appropriate safety measures to minimize radiation exposure during administration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Use waterproof gloves and effective shielding , including syringe shields , when handling and administering Axumin .
2 . 2 Recommended Dose and Administration Instructions The recommended dose is 370 MBq ( 10 mCi ) administered as an intravenous bolus injection .
• Inspect Axumin visually for particulate matter and discoloration before administration .
Do not use the drug if the solution contains particulate matter or is discolored .
• Use aseptic technique and radiation shielding when withdrawing and administering Axumin .
• Calculate the necessary volume to administer based on calibration time and date , using a suitably calibrated instrument .
The recommended maximum volume of injection of undiluted Axumin is 5 mL .
• Axumin may be diluted with 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP .
• After the Axumin injection , administer an intravenous flush of sterile 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP to ensure full delivery of the dose .
• Dispose of any unused drug in a safe manner in compliance with applicable regulations .
2 . 3 Patient Preparation Prior to PET Imaging • Advise the patient to avoid any significant exercise for at least one day prior to PET imaging .
• Advise patients not to eat or drink for at least 4 hours ( other than sips of water for taking medications ) prior to administration of Axumin .
• Advise patients to void approximately 30 minutes to 60 minutes prior to administration of Axumin and then refrain from voiding until after the scan has been completed 2 . 4 Image Acquisition Guidelines Position the patient supine with arms above the head .
Begin PET scanning 3 minutes to 5 minutes after completion of the Axumin injection .
It is recommended that image acquisition should start from mid - thigh and proceed to the base of the skull .
Typical total scan time is between 20 minutes to 30 minutes .
2 . 5 Image Display and Interpretation Localization of prostate cancer recurrence in sites typical for prostate cancer recurrence is based on fluciclovine F 18 uptake in comparison with tissue background .
For small lesions ( less than 1 cm in diameter ) focal uptake greater than blood pool should be considered suspicious for prostate cancer recurrence .
For larger lesions , uptake equal to or greater than bone marrow is considered suspicious for prostate cancer recurrence .
2 . 6 Radiation Dosimetry The radiation absorbed doses estimated for adult patients following intravenous injection of Axumin are shown in Table 1 .
Values were calculated from human biodistribution data using OLINDA / EXM ( Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment / Exponential Modeling ) software .
The ( radiation absorbed ) effective dose resulting from the administration of the recommended activity of 370 MBq of Axumin is 8 mSv .
For an administered activity of 370 MBq ( 10 mCi ) , the highest - magnitude radiation doses are delivered to the pancreas , cardiac wall , and uterine wall : 38 mGy , 19 mGy , and 17 mGy , respectively .
If a CT scan is simultaneously performed as part of the PET procedure , exposure to ionizing radiation will increase in an amount dependent on the settings used in the CT acquisition .

11 DESCRIPTION 11 . 1 Chemical Characteristics Axumin contains the fluorine 18 ( F 18 ) labeled synthetic amino acid analog fluciclovine .
Fluciclovine F 18 is a radioactive diagnostic agent used with PET imaging .
Chemically , fluciclovine F 18 is ( 1 r , 3 r ) - 1 - amino - 3 [ 18 F ] fluorocyclobutane - 1 - carboxylic acid .
The molecular weight is 132 . 1 and the structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Axumin is a sterile , non - pyrogenic , clear , colorless , hyperosmolal ( approximately 500 mOsm / kg to 540 mOsm / kg ) injection for intravenous use .
Each milliliter contains up to 2 micrograms of fluciclovine , 335 MBq to 8 , 200 MBq ( 9 mCi to 221 mCi ) fluciclovine F 18 at calibration time and date , and 20 mg trisodium citrate in water for injection .
The solution also contains hydrochloric acid , sodium hydroxide and has a pH between 4 and 6 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 11 . 2 Physical Characteristics Fluorine 18 ( F 18 ) is a cyclotron produced radionuclide that decays by positron emission ( ß + decay , 96 . 7 % ) and orbital electron capture ( 3 . 3 % ) to stable oxygen 18 with a physical half - life of 109 . 7 minutes .
The positron can undergo annihilation with an electron to produce two gamma rays ; the energy of each gamma ray is 511 keV ( Table 2 ) .
Table 2 : Principal Radiation Produced from Decay of Fluorine 18 Radiation Energy ( keV ) Abundance ( % ) Positron 249 . 8 96 . 7 Gamma 511 . 0 193 . 5 11 . 3 External Radiation The point source air - kerma coefficient for F 18 is 3 . 75 x 10 - 17 Gy m2 / ( Bq s ) .
The first half - value thickness of lead ( Pb ) for F 18 gamma rays is approximately 6 mm .
The relative reduction of radiation emitted by F 18 that results from various thicknesses of lead shielding is shown in Table 3 .
The use of 8 cm of Pb will decrease the radiation transmission ( i . e . , exposure ) by a factor of about 10 , 000 .

Fluciclovine F 18 is taken up to a greater extent in prostate cancer cells compared with surrounding normal tissues .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Following intravenous administration , the tumor - to - normal tissue contrast is highest between 4 and 10 minutes after injection , with a 61 % reduction in mean tumor uptake at 90 minutes after injection .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Following intravenous administration , fluciclovine F 18 distributes to the liver ( 14 % of administered activity ) , pancreas ( 3 % ) , lung ( 7 % ) , red bone marrow ( 12 % ) and myocardium ( 4 % ) .
With increasing time , fluciclovine F 18 distributes to skeletal muscle .
Excretion Across the first four hours post - injection , 3 % of administered radioactivity was excreted in the urine .
Across the first 24 hours post - injection , 5 % of administered radioactivity was excreted in the urine .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No long term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of fluciclovine .
Mutagenesis Fluciclovine was not mutagenic in vitro in reverse mutation assay in bacterial cells and in chromosome aberration test in cultured mammalian cells , and was negative in an in vivo clastogenicity assay in rats after intravenous injection of doses up to 43 mcg / kg .
However , fluciclovine F 18 has the potential to be mutagenic because of the F 18 radioisotope .
Impairment of Fertility No studies in animals have been performed to evaluate potential impairment of fertility in males or females .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of Axumin were evaluated in two studies ( Study 1 and Study 2 ) in men with suspected recurrence of prostate cancer based on rising PSA levels following radical prostatectomy and / or radiotherapy .
Study 1 evaluated 105 Axumin scans in comparison to histopathology obtained by biopsy of the prostate bed and biopsies of lesions suspicious by imaging .
PET / CT imaging generally included the abdomen and pelvic regions .
The Axumin images were originally read by on - site readers .
The images were subsequently read by three blinded independent readers .
Table 4 shows the performance of Axumin in the detection of recurrence in each patient scan and , specifically , within the prostatic bed and extra - prostatic regions , respectively .
The results of the independent read were generally consistent with one another and confirmed the results of the on - site reads .

In general , patients with negative scans had lower PSA values than those with positive scans .
The detection rate ( number with positive scans / total scanned ) for patients with a PSA value of less than or equal to 1 . 78 ng / mL ( 1 st PSA quartile ) was 15 / 25 , of which 11 were histologically confirmed as positive .
In the remaining three PSA quartiles , the detection rate was 71 / 74 , of which 58 were histologically confirmed .
Among the 25 patients in the first PSA quartile , there were 4 false positive scans and 1 false negative scan .
For the 74 patients with PSA levels greater than1 . 78 ng / mL , there were 13 false positive scans and no false negative scans .
Study 2 evaluated the concordance between 96 Axumin and C11 choline scans in patients with median PSA value of 1 . 44 ng / mL ( interquartile range = 0 . 78 ng / mL to 2 . 8 ng / mL ) .
The C 11 choline scans were read by on - site readers .
The Axumin scans were read by the same three blinded independent readers used for Study 1 .
The agreement values between the Axumin and C11 choline reads were 61 % , 67 % and 77 % , respectively .
