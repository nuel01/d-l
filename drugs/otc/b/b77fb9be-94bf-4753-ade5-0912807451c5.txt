It is not known if these events were related to SARS - CoV - 2 monoclonal antibody use or were due to progression of COVID ‑ 19 .
5 . 3 Limitations of Benefit and Potential for Risk in Patients with Severe COVID - 19 Benefit of treatment with sotrovimab has not been observed in patients hospitalized due to COVID ‑ 19 .
SARS - CoV - 2 monoclonal antibodies may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID ‑ 19 requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation .
Therefore , sotrovimab is not authorized for use in the following patient populations [ see Limitations of Authorized Use ] : • • Adults or pediatric patients who are hospitalized due to COVID ‑ 19 , OR • • Adults or pediatric patients who require oxygen therapy and / or respiratory support due to COVID ‑ 19 , OR • • Adults or pediatric patients who require an increase in baseline oxygen flow rate and / or respiratory support due to COVID ‑ 19 in those patients on chronic oxygen .
6 OVERALL SAFETY SUMMARY 6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience The safety of sotrovimab in subjects with mild - to - moderate COVID - 19 ( subjects with COVID - 19 symptoms who are not hospitalized ) is based on analyses from COMET - ICE , a Phase 1 / 2 / 3 trial , and COMET - TAIL , a Phase 3 trial [ see Clinical Trial Results and Supporting Data for EUA ( 18 ) ] .
In COMET - ICE , subjects received a single 500 - mg infusion of sotrovimab ( n = 523 ) or placebo ( n = 526 ) .
Two subjects experienced treatment interruptions due to infusion site extravasation ; infusion was completed for each .
In COMET - TAIL , subjects received a single 500 - mg IV infusion of sotrovimab ( n = 393 ) .
Infusion - Related Reactions Including Hypersensitivity Infusion - related reactions , including immediate hypersensitivity reactions , were observed in 1 % of subjects treated with sotrovimab and 1 % of subjects treated with placebo in COMET - ICE and in < 1 % of subjects treated with IV sotrovimab in COMET - TAIL .
Reported events that started within 24 hours of study treatment were pyrexia , chills , dizziness , dyspnea , pruritus , rash , and infusion - related reactions ; all events were Grade 1 ( mild ) or Grade 2 ( moderate ) .
One case of anaphylaxis was reported following sotrovimab infusion in a study in hospitalized subjects ; the infusion was immediately discontinued , and the subject received epinephrine .
The event resolved but recurred within 2 hours ; the subject received another dose of epinephrine and improved with no additional reactions .
Other serious infusion - related reactions ( including immediate hypersensitivity reactions ) reported following sotrovimab infusion in the hospitalized study included Grade 3 ( serious ) or Grade 4 ( life - threatening ) bronchospasm and shortness of breath .
These events were also reported following infusion of placebo .
Sotrovimab is not authorized for use in subjects hospitalized due to COVID - 19 [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 ) ] .
Hypersensitivity adverse reactions ( i . e . , adverse events assessed as causally related ) were observed in 2 % of subjects treated with sotrovimab and 1 % of subjects treated with placebo in COMET - ICE and in < 1 % of subjects treated with sotrovimab in COMET - TAIL .
All were Grade 1 ( mild ) or Grade 2 ( moderate ) , and none of the reactions in either trial led to permanent discontinuation of the infusions .
One reaction led to pausing of the infusion [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Common Adverse Events The most common treatment - emergent adverse events observed in the sotrovimab treatment group in COMET - ICE were rash ( 1 % ) and diarrhea ( 2 % ) , all of which were Grade 1 ( mild ) or Grade 2 ( moderate ) .
No other treatment - emergent adverse events were reported at a higher rate with sotrovimab compared to placebo .
6 . 2 Post - Authorization Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - authorization use of sotrovimab .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Immune System Disorders Anaphylaxis [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
7 PATIENT MONITORING RECOMMENDATIONS Clinically monitor patients during dose administration and observe patients for at least 1 hour after IV infusion is complete [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) and Overall Safety Summary ( 6 . 1 ) ] .

10 DRUG INTERACTIONS Clinical drug - drug interaction studies have not been performed with sotrovimab .
Sotrovimab is not renally excreted or metabolized by cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes ; therefore , interactions with concomitant medications that are renally excreted or that are substrates , inducers , or inhibitors of CYP enzymes are unlikely .
11 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 11 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to sotrovimab during pregnancy .
Pregnant and recently pregnant individuals can go to https : / / covid - pr . pregistry . com to enroll or call 1 - 800 - 616 - 3791 to obtain information about the registry .
Risk Summary There are insufficient data to evaluate a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcome .
Sotrovimab should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the mother and the fetus .
There are maternal and fetal risks associated with untreated COVID - 19 in pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
Nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted with sotrovimab .
In a cross - reactive binding assay using a protein array enriched for human embryofetal proteins , no off - target binding was detected for sotrovimab .
Since sotrovimab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) containing the LS modification in the Fc domain , it has the potential for placental transfer from the mother to the developing fetus .
The potential treatment benefit or risk of placental transfer of sotrovimab to the developing fetus is not known .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - Associated Maternal and / or Embryo - Fetal Risk : COVID - 19 in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes , including preeclampsia , eclampsia , preterm birth , premature rupture of membranes , venous thromboembolic disease , and fetal death .
11 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no available data on the presence of sotrovimab in human or animal milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for sotrovimab and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from sotrovimab or from the underlying maternal condition .
Individuals with COVID - 19 who are breastfeeding should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID - 19 .
11 . 3 Pediatric Use Sotrovimab is not authorized for use in pediatric patients under 12 years of age or weighing less than 40 kg .
The safety and effectiveness of sotrovimab have not been assessed in pediatric patients .
The recommended dosing regimen in patients 12 years to less than 18 years of age , weighing at least 40 kg , is expected to result in comparable serum exposures of sotrovimab as those observed in adults .
11 . 4 Geriatric Use Of the 528 subjects randomized to receive sotrovimab in COMET - ICE , 20 % were 65 years of age and older and 11 % were over 70 years of age .
Of the 378 subjects in the primary analysis population receiving sotrovimab in COMET - TAIL , 25 % were 65 years of age or older and 8 % were over 75 years of age .
The difference in pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of sotrovimab in geriatric patients compared to younger patients has not been quantified .
11 . 5 Renal Impairment No clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effects of renal impairment on the PK of sotrovimab .
Sotrovimab is not eliminated intact in the urine , thus renal impairment is not expected to affect the exposure of sotrovimab .
11 . 6 Hepatic Impairment No clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effects of hepatic impairment on the PK of sotrovimab .
The impact of hepatic impairment on the PK of sotrovimab is unknown .
12 OVERDOSAGE There is no human experience of acute overdosage with sotrovimab .
There is no specific treatment for an overdose with sotrovimab .
If overdose occurs , the patient should be treated supportively with appropriate monitoring as necessary .
13 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION Sotrovimab is a human immunoglobulin G - 1 ( IgG1 - kappa ) monoclonal antibody consisting of 2 identical light chain ( LC ) polypeptides composed of 214 amino acids each and 2 identical heavy chain ( HC ) polypeptides , each composed of 457 amino acids .
Sotrovimab is produced by a Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line and has a molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa .
Sotrovimab injection is a sterile , preservative - free , clear , colorless or yellow to brown solution supplied in a single - dose vial for IV infusion after dilution .
Each mL contains sotrovimab ( 62 . 5 mg ) , L - histidine ( 1 . 51 mg ) , L - histidine monohydrochloride ( 2 . 15 mg ) , L - methionine ( 0 . 75 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 0 . 4 mg ) , and sucrose ( 70 mg ) .
The solution of sotrovimab has a pH of 6 . 0 .
14 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 14 . 1 Mechanism of Action Sotrovimab is a recombinant human IgG1 - kappa mAb that binds to a conserved epitope on the spike protein receptor binding domain of SARS - CoV - 2 with a dissociation constant KD = 0 . 21 nM ) but does not compete with human ACE2 receptor binding ( IC50 value > 33 . 6 nM [ 5 µg / mL ] ) .
Sotrovimab inhibits an undefined step that occurs after virus attachment and prior to fusion of the viral and cell membranes .
The Fc domain of sotrovimab includes M428L and N434S amino acid substitutions ( LS modification ) that extend antibody half - life , but do not impact wild - type Fc - mediated effector functions in cell culture .
14 . 2 Pharmacokinetics A summary of PK parameters following a single 500 - mg IV infusion is presented in Table 1 : Table 1 .
Summary of Derived IV Sotrovimab Serum Pharmacokinetic ParametersPK Parametera Sotrovimab ( 500 mg IV ) n Cmaxb , µg / mL 143 ( 34 . 5 ) 102 CD29b , µg / mL 40 . 7 ( 40 . 3 ) 135 AUCD1 - 29 c , day * µg / mL 1410 ( 25 . 6 ) 20 a Parameters are reported as geometric mean ( % CVb ) .
b Cmax ( end of infusion ) and CD29 ( serum sotrovimab concentration on Study Day 29 ) estimates are based on cumulative intensive and sparse PK data available to date from the lead and expansion phases of COMET - PEAK B and C . c AUCD1 - 29 ( area under the curve from Study Day 1 to 29 ) estimates are based on noncompartmental analyses of intensive PK from the Lead - in Phases of COMET - PEAK B and C . Specific Populations The effect of different covariates ( e . g . , age , sex , race , body weight , disease severity , hepatic impairment ) on the PK of sotrovimab is unknown .
Renal impairment is not expected to impact the PK of sotrovimab since mAbs with molecular weight > 69 kDa do not undergo renal elimination .
Similarly , dialysis is not expected to impact the PK of sotrovimab .
15 MICROBIOLOGY / RESISTANCE INFORMATION Antiviral Activity The neutralization activity of sotrovimab against SARS - CoV - 2 ( isolate USA WA1 / 2020 ) was measured in a concentration response model using cultured Vero E6 cells .
Sotrovimab neutralized SARS ‑ CoV - 2 with an average EC50 value of 0 . 67 nM ( 100 . 1 ng / mL ) and an average EC90 value of 1 . 2 nM ( 186 . 3 ng / mL ) .
Sotrovimab demonstrated cell culture FcγR activation using Jurkat reporter cells expressing FcγRIIa ( low - affinity R131 and high affinity H131 alleles ) , FcγRIIIa ( low - affinity F158 and high - affinity V158 alleles ) and FcγRIIb .
Sotrovimab exhibited antibody - dependent cell - mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) in cell culture using isolated human natural killer ( NK ) cells following engagement with target cells expressing spike protein .
Sotrovimab also elicited antibody - dependent cellular phagocytosis ( ADCP ) in cell - based assays using CD14 + monocytes targeting cells expressing spike protein .
Antibody Dependent Enhancement ( ADE ) of Infection The risk that sotrovimab could mediate viral uptake and replication by immune cells was studied in U937 cells , primary human monocytic dendritic cells , and peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
This experiment did not demonstrate productive viral infection in immune cells exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 in the presence of concentrations of sotrovimab from 1 - fold down to 1000 - fold below the EC50 value .
The potential for ADE was also evaluated in a hamster model of SARS - CoV - 2 using sotrovimab .
Intraperitoneal administration prior to inoculation resulted in a dose - dependent improvement in all measured outcomes ( body weight , total viral RNA in the lungs , or infectious virus levels based on TCID50 measurements ) .
No evidence of enhancement of disease was observed at any dose evaluated , including sub - neutralizing doses down to 0 . 05 mg / kg .
Antiviral Resistance There is a potential risk of treatment failure due to the development of viral variants that are resistant to sotrovimab .
Prescribing healthcare providers should choose an authorized therapeutic option with activity against circulating SARS - CoV - 2 variants in their state .
SARS - CoV - 2 variant frequency data for states and jurisdictions can be accessed on the CDC website [ 1 ] .
Spike protein amino acid substitution E340A emerged in cell culture selection of resistant virus and had a > 100 - fold reduction in activity in a pseudotyped virus - like particle ( VLP ) assay .
This substitution is in the conserved epitope of sotrovimab , which is comprised of 23 amino acids .
A pseudotyped VLP assessment in cell culture showed that epitope amino acid substitutions P337H / K / L / R / T , E340A / I / K / G / Q / V , T345P , K356T , and L441N conferred reduced susceptibility to sotrovimab based on observed fold - increase in EC50 value shown in parentheses : P337H ( 5 . 13 ) , P337K ( > 304 ) , P337L ( > 192 ) , P337R ( > 192 ) , P337T ( 10 . 62 ) , E340A ( > 100 ) , E340G ( 18 . 21 ) , E340I ( > 190 ) , E340K ( > 297 ) , E340Q ( > 50 ) , E340V ( > 200 ) , T345P ( 225 ) , K356T ( 5 . 90 ) , and L441N ( 72 ) .
The presence of the highly prevalent D614G substitution , either alone or in combination , did not alter neutralization of sotrovimab .
Pseudotyped VLP assessments indicate that sotrovimab retains activity against the B . 1 . 1 . 7 ( Alpha , UK origin : H69 - , V70 - , Y144 ‑ , N501Y , A570D , D614G , P681H , T716I , S982A , D1118H ; 2 . 3 - fold change in EC50 value ) , B . 1 . 351 ( Beta , South Africa origin : L18F , D80A , D215G , R246I , K417N , E484K , N501Y , D614G , A701V ; 0 . 6 - fold change in EC50 value ) , P . 1 ( Gamma , Brazil origin : L18F , T20N , P26S , D138Y , R190S , K417T , E484K , N501Y , D614G , H655Y , T1027I , V1176F ; 0 . 35 - fold change in EC50 value ) , B . 1 . 427 / B . 1 . 429 ( Epsilon , California origin : S13I , W152C , L452R , D614G ; 0 . 7 ‑ fold change in EC50 value ) , B . 1 . 526 ( Iota , New York origin : L5F , T95I , D253G , E484K , D614G , A701V ; 0 . 6 - fold change in EC50 value ) , B . 1 . 617 . 1 ( Kappa , India origin : T95I , G142D , E154K , L452R , E484Q , D614G , P681R , Q1071H ; 0 . 7 - fold change in EC50 value ) , B . 1 . 617 . 2 ( Delta , India origin : T19R , G142D , E156G , F157 - , R158 - , L452R , T478K , D614G , P681R , D950N ; 1 - fold change in EC50 value ) , AY . 1 ( Delta [ + K417N ] , India origin : T19R , T95I , G142D , E156G , F157 - , R158 - , W258L , K417N , L452R , T478K , D614G , P681R , D950N ; 1 . 1 - fold change in EC50 value ) , AY . 2 ( Delta [ + K417N ] , India origin : T19R , V70F , G142D , E156G , F157 - , R158 - , A222V , K417N , L452R , T478K , D614G , P681R , D950N ; 1 . 3 - fold change in EC50 value ) , AY . 4 . 2 ( Delta , India origin : T19R , T95I , G142D , Y145H , E156G , F157 - , R158 - , A222V , L452R , T478K , D614G , P681R , D950N ; 1 . 6 - fold change in EC50 value ) , C . 37 ( Lambda , Peru origin : G75V , T76I , del246 - 252 , L452Q , F490S , T859N ; 1 . 5 - fold change in EC50 value ) , B . 1 . 621 ( Mu , Colombia origin : T95I , Y144T , Y145S , ins146N , R346K , E484K , N501Y , D614G , P681H , D950N ; 1 . 3 - fold change in EC50 value ) , B . 1 . 1 . 529 / BA . 1 ( Omicron , South Africa origin : A67V , del69 - 70 , T95I , G142D , del143 - 145 , del211 , L212I , ins214EPE , G339D , S371L , S373P , S375F , K417N , N440K , G446S , S477N , T478K , E484A , Q493R , G496S , Q498R , N501Y , Y505H , T547K , D614G , H655Y , N679K , P681H , N764K , D796Y , N856K , Q954H , N969K , L981F ; 2 . 7 - fold change in EC50 value ) , and B . 1 . 1 . 529 / BA . 1 . 1 ( Omicron [ + R346K ] , South Africa origin : A67V , del69 - 70 , T95I , G142D , del143 - 145 , del211 , L212I , ins214EPE , G339D , R346K , S371L , S373P , S375F , K417N , N440K , G446S , S477N , T478K , E484A , Q493R , G496S , Q498R , N501Y , Y505H , T547K , D614G , H655Y , N679K , P681H , N764K , D796Y , N856K , Q954H , N969K , L981F ; 3 . 3 - fold change in EC50 value ) variant spike proteins ( Table 2 ) .

r Clinical relevance of the 7 . 3 - fold reduction in susceptibility is unknown .
Microneutralization data using authentic SARS - CoV - 2 variant viruses indicate that sotrovimab retains activity against the B . 1 . 1 . 7 ( Alpha , UK origin ; 3 - fold change in EC50 value ) , B . 1 . 351 ( Beta , South Africa origin ; 1 . 2 - fold change in EC50 value ) , P . 1 ( Gamma , Brazil origin ; 1 . 6 ‑ fold change in EC50 value ) , B . 1 . 617 . 1 ( Kappa , India origin ; 0 . 9 - fold change in EC50 value ) , B . 1 . 617 . 2 ( Delta , India origin ; 0 . 4 - fold change in EC50 value ) , B . 1 . 1 . 529 / BA . 1 ( Omicron , South Africa origin : 3 . 8 - fold change in EC50 value ) , and B . 1 . 1 . 529 / BA . 1 . 1 ( Omicron , South Africa origin : 4 . 3 - fold change in EC50 value ) variants ( Table 3 ) .
Microneutralization data from authentic SARS - CoV - 2 variant virus indicate that sotrovimab has a 15 . 7 - fold reduction in activity relative to wild - type against the B . 1 . 1 . 529 / BA . 2 variant ( Omicron , South Africa origin ; 15 . 7 - fold change in EC value ) ( Table 3 ) .
The geometric mean EC90 values from two different B . 1 . 1 . 529 / BA . 2 Omicron isolates were 99 . 06 nM ( 14 , 760 . 0 ng / mL ) and 45 . 62 nM ( 6 , 796 . 8 ng / mL ) , respectively , representing 48 . 1 - and 25 . 3 - fold increases in EC90 value versus wild - type , respectively .
Based on the totality of the available evidence , including EC90 values determined using authentic SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron B . 1 . 1 . 529 / BA . 2 isolates and clinical and clinical pharmacology data for sotrovimab , it is unlikely that the authorized dose of sotrovimab will be effective against the SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron B . 1 . 1 . 529 / BA . 2 variant .

Based on the totality of the available evidence , including EC90 values determined using authentic SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron B . 1 . 1 . 529 / BA . 2 isolates and clinical and clinical pharmacology data for sotrovimab , it is unlikely that the authorized dose of sotrovimab will be effective against the SARS - CoV - 2 Omicron B . 1 . 1 . 529 / BA . 2 variant .
Limited nucleotide sequencing data from a total of 539 COMET - ICE subjects indicated that 36 subjects ( 16 treated with placebo and 20 treated with sotrovimab ) carried the B . 1 . 1 . 7 ( Alpha , UK origin ) variant .
Four subjects ( 2 treated with placebo and 2 treated with sotrovimab ) carried the N501Y substitution .
Thirty - one subjects ( 19 treated with placebo and 12 treated with sotrovimab ) carried the B . 1 . 427 / B . 1 . 429 ( Epsilon , California origin ) variant .
Eight additional subjects carried the L452R substitution ( 6 treated with placebo and 2 treated with sotrovimab ) .
Eleven subjects carried the P . 1 ( Gamma , Brazil origin ) variant ( 3 treated with placebo and 8 treated with sotrovimab ) .
Three subjects carried the B . 1 . 526 ( Iota , New York origin ) variant with the E484K substitution ( 2 treated with placebo and 1 treated with sotrovimab ) , while 9 subjects ( 4 treated with placebo and 5 treated with sotrovimab ) carried the S477N substitution that has been associated with the B . 1 . 526 ( Iota , New York origin ) variant .
Additionally , 10 subjects carried the E484K substitution ( 4 treated with placebo and 6 treated with sotrovimab ) , 2 carried the S494P substitution ( 1 treated with placebo and 1 treated with sotrovimab ) , and 3 carried the S494P substitution with the N501Y substitution ( 2 treated with placebo and 1 treated with sotrovimab ) .
Two subjects in the group receiving sotrovimab ( 1 carrying the B . 1 . 427 / B . 1 . 429 [ Epsilon , California origin ] variant and 1 carrying the B . 1 . 1 . 7 [ Alpha , UK origin ] variant ) progressed to hospitalization .
Four subjects in the placebo group ( 2 carrying the E484K substitution , 1 carrying the P . 1 [ Gamma , Brazil origin ] variant , and 1 carrying the B . 1 . 1 . 7 [ Alpha , UK origin ] variant ) progressed to hospitalization .
None of the subjects with currently available baseline sequences carried the full complement of substitutions characteristic of the B . 1 . 351 ( Beta , South Africa origin ) or B . 1 . 617 ( Delta , India origin ) variants .
In COMET - ICE , post - baseline epitope substitutions were detected in 20 subjects in the cohort receiving sotrovimab ( spike protein substitutions P337L / E340K [ 49 . 4 % / 54 . 8 % allele frequency ] ; E340A [ 99 . 0 % ] ; E340K [ 5 subjects : 8 . 0 % to 99 . 9 % ] ; E340V [ 73 . 1 % ] ; A344V [ 6 . 2 % ] ; R346G [ 5 . 2 % ] ; K356R [ 7 . 5 % ] ; S359G [ 2 subjects : 12 . 2 % and 8 . 3 % ] ) ; C361T [ 7 subjects : 5 . 0 % to 15 . 7 % ] .
Of the substitutions detected at baseline and post - baseline , L335F , L335S , P337L , G339C , E340A , E340K , A344V , R346G , R346I , K356N , K356R , R357I , I358V and S359G substitutions have been assessed phenotypically using a pseudotyped VLP system .
P337L , E340A , and E340K substitutions confer reduced susceptibility to sotrovimab ( > 100 - fold change in EC50 value ) .
Sotrovimab retains activity against L335F ( 0 . 8 - fold change in EC50 value ) , L335S ( 0 . 9 - fold change in EC50 value ) , G339C ( 1 . 2 - fold change in EC50 value ) , A344V ( 1 . 1 - fold change in EC50 value ) , R346G ( 0 . 9 - fold change in EC50 value ) , R346I ( 1 . 7 - fold change in EC50 value ) , K356N ( 1 . 1 - fold change in EC50 value ) , K356R ( 0 . 8 - fold change in EC50 value ) , R357I ( 1 - fold change in EC50 value ) , I358V ( 0 . 7 - fold change in EC50 value ) , and S359G ( 0 . 8 - fold change in EC50 value ) substitutions .
The clinical impact of these substitutions is not yet known .
Data collection and analysis is still ongoing .
Immune Response Attenuation There is a theoretical risk that antibody administration may attenuate the endogenous immune response to SARS - CoV - 2 and make patients more susceptible to re - infection .
[ 1 ] https : / / www . cdc . gov / coronavirus / 2019 - ncov / cases - updates / variant - proportions . html 16 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY Carcinogenesis , mutagenesis , and reproductive toxicology studies with sotrovimab have not been conducted .
In a toxicology study in monkeys , sotrovimab had no adverse effects when administered intravenously .
In tissue cross reactivity studies using human and monkey adult tissues , no binding of clinical concern was detected for sotrovimab .
In a cross - reactive binding assay using a protein array enriched for human embryofetal proteins , no off - target binding was detected for sotrovimab .
17 ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGIC AND EFFICACY DATA In a Syrian Golden hamster model of SARS - CoV - 2 infection , antiviral activity was demonstrated using a single dose of sotrovimab which was administered intraperitoneally at 24 - or 48 - hours prior to infection .
Animals receiving 5 mg / kg or more of the antibody showed a significant improvement in body weight loss and significantly decreased total lung SARS - CoV - 2 viral RNA compared to vehicle only and control antibody - treated animals .
Levels of virus in the lung ( as measured by TCID50 ) were significantly decreased versus controls in hamsters receiving 0 . 5 mg / kg or more of the antibody .
Protection was also observed in the Syrian Golden hamster model using the SARS - CoV - 2 B . 1 . 351 ( Beta , South Africa origin ) variant .
Significant reductions in total and replication competent virus were observed on Day 4 post - infection in animals receiving a single intraperitoneal dose of 0 . 5 , 2 , 5 , or 15 mg / kg sotrovimab compared to isotype control antibody - treated animals .
18 CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS AND SUPPORTING DATA FOR EUA The clinical data supporting this EUA are based on the analysis of the Phase 1 / 2 / 3 COMET - ICE trial ( NCT04545060 ) with supporting data from the Phase 3 COMET - TAIL trial ( NCT04913675 ) .
COMET - ICE Trial COMET - ICE was a , randomized , multi - center , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial studying sotrovimab for the treatment of subjects with mild - to - moderate COVID - 19 ( subjects with COVID - 19 symptoms who are not hospitalized ) .
Eligible subjects were 18 years of age and older with at least one of the following comorbidities : diabetes , obesity ( BMI > 30 ) , chronic kidney disease , congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , or moderate to severe asthma ; or were 55 years of age and older regardless of comorbidities .
The trial included symptomatic subjects with SARS - CoV - 2 infection as confirmed by local laboratory tests and / or point of care tests and symptom onset within 5 days of enrollment .
Subjects with severe COVID - 19 requiring supplemental oxygen or hospitalization and severely immunocompromised subjects were excluded from the trial .
A total of 1 , 057 eligible subjects were randomized to receive a single 500 - mg infusion of sotrovimab ( n = 528 ) or placebo ( n = 529 ) over 1 hour ( Intent to Treat [ ITT ] population at Day 29 ) .
At baseline , the median age was 53 years ( range : 17 to 96 ) ; 20 % of subjects were 65 years of age or older and 11 % were over 70 years of age ; 46 % of subjects were male ; 87 % were White , 8 % Black or African American , 4 % Asian , 65 % Hispanic or Latino .
Fifty - nine percent of subjects received sotrovimab or placebo within 3 days of COVID - 19 symptom onset and 41 % within 4 to 5 days .
The four most common pre - defined risk factors or comorbidities were obesity ( 63 % ) , 55 years of age or older ( 47 % ) , diabetes requiring medication ( 22 % ) , and moderate - to - severe asthma ( 17 % ) .
Overall , baseline demographic and disease characteristics were well balanced between the treatment arms .
The primary endpoint , progression of COVID - 19 at Day 29 , was reduced by 79 % ( adjusted relative risk reduction ) in recipients of sotrovimab versus placebo .
Table 4 provides the results for the primary and key secondary endpoint of COMET - ICE .
Table 4 .
Efficacy Results in Adults with Mild - to - Moderate COVID - 19 in COMET - ICE at Day 29 Sotrovimab n = 528 Placebo n = 529 Progression of COVID - 19 ( defined as hospitalization for > 24 hours for acute management of any illness or death from any cause ) ( Day 29 ) a Proportion ( n , % ) 6 ( 1 . 1 % ) 30 ( 5 . 7 % ) Adjusted Relative Risk Reduction ( 95 % CI ) 79 % ( 50 % , 91 % ) All - cause mortality ( up to Day 29 ) Proportion ( n , % ) 0 2 ( < 1 % ) • a The determination of primary efficacy was based on a planned interim analysis of 583 subjects , which had similar findings to those seen in the full population above .
The adjusted relative risk reduction was 85 % with a 97 . 24 % CI of ( 44 % , 96 % ) and p - value = 0 . 002 .
Within the subset of the ITT population who had a central laboratory confirmed , virologically quantifiable nasopharyngeal swab at Day 1 and Day 8 ( n = 639 ) , the mean decline from baseline in viral load at Day 8 was greater in subjects treated with sotrovimab ( - 2 . 610 log10 copies / mL ) compared to that in subjects treated with placebo ( ‑ 2 . 358 ) ; mean difference = - 0 . 251 , 95 % CI : ( - 0 . 415 , - 0 . 087 ) .
COMET - TAIL Trial COMET - TAIL was a randomized , multi - center , open label trial which evaluated the efficacy , safety , and tolerability of sotrovimab for the treatment of subjects with mild - to - moderate COVID - 19 ( subjects with COVID - 19 symptoms who are not hospitalized ) .
Eligible subjects were 12 years of age or older with at least one of the following comorbidities : diabetes , obesity ( BMI ≥ 85 th percentile for age / gender based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [ CDC ] growth charts for adolescents or BMI ≥ 30 for subjects ≥ 18 years old ) , chronic kidney disease , congenital heart disease , congestive heart failure ( for subjects ≥ 18 years old ) , chronic lung diseases , sickle cell disease , neurodevelopmental disorders , immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive medications , or chronic liver disease ; or were 55 years of age or older regardless of comorbidities .
The trial included symptomatic subjects with SARS - CoV - 2 infection as confirmed by local laboratory tests and / or point of care tests and symptom onset within 7 days of enrollment .
Subjects with severe COVID - 19 requiring supplemental oxygen or hospitalization were excluded from the trial .
The ITT population consisted of 385 subjects randomized to receive a single 500 - mg IV infusion of sotrovimab over 15 minutes .
The primary analysis population , which excluded 7 subjects because they were fully vaccinated and immunocompetent ( key inclusion / exclusion violation ) , consisted of 378 subjects .
In the primary analysis population at baseline , the median age was 51 years ( range : 15 to 90 , including 2 subjects under 18 years ) ; 25 % of subjects were 65 years of age or older and 8 % were over 75 years of age ; 42 % of subjects were male ; 96 % were White and 4 % were Black or African American ; 83 % were Hispanic or Latino .
Forty - eight percent ( 48 % ) of subjects received sotrovimab within 3 days of COVID - 19 symptom onset , 37 % within 4 to 5 days , and 14 % within 6 to 7 days .
The four most common pre - defined risk factors or comorbidities were obesity ( 63 % ) , 55 years of age or older ( 42 % ) , chronic lung disease ( 16 % ) , and diabetes requiring medication ( 13 % ) .
In the primary analysis population , 5 ( 1 . 3 % ) of 378 subjects had progression to COVID - 19 defined as hospitalization for > 24 hours for acute management of any illness or death due to any cause through Day 29 .
No deaths were reported through Day 29 .

This Fact Sheet contains information to help you understand the potential risks and potential benefits of receiving sotrovimab , which you or your child have received or may receive .
The U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has issued an Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) to make sotrovimab available during the COVID - 19 pandemic ( for more details about an EUA please see “ What is an Emergency Use Authorization ? ”
at the end of this document ) .
Sotrovimab is not an FDA - approved medicine in the United States .
Read this Fact Sheet for information about sotrovimab .
Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions .
It is your choice for you or your child to receive sotrovimab or stop it at any time .
What is COVID - 19 ?
COVID - 19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus .
People can get COVID ‑ 19 through contact with another person who has the virus .
COVID - 19 illnesses have ranged from very mild ( including some with no reported symptoms ) to severe , including illness resulting in death .
While information so far suggests that most COVID - 19 illness is mild , serious illness can happen and may cause some of your or your child ’ s other medical conditions to become worse .
Older people and people of all ages with severe , long - lasting ( chronic ) medical conditions like heart disease , lung disease , diabetes , and obesity , for example , seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID - 19 .
What is sotrovimab ?
Sotrovimab is an investigational medicine used for the treatment of mild - to - moderate symptoms of COVID ‑ 19 in adults and children ( 12 years of age and older weighing at least 88 pounds [ 40 kg ] ) with positive results of direct severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) viral testing , and who are at high risk of progression to severe COVID - 19 , including hospitalization or death .
Sotrovimab is investigational because it is still being studied .
There is limited information about the safety and effectiveness of using sotrovimab to treat people with mild - to - moderate COVID - 19 .
The FDA has authorized the emergency use of sotrovimab for the treatment of mild - to - moderate symptoms of COVID - 19 in adults and children ( 12 years of age and older weighing at least 88 pounds [ 40 kg ] ) with positive results of direct SARS - CoV - 2 viral testing , and who are at high risk of progression to severe COVID - 19 , including hospitalization or death under an EUA .
For more information on EUA , see the “ What is an Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) ? ”
section at the end of this Fact Sheet .
What should I tell my healthcare provider before I or my child receive sotrovimab ?
Tell your healthcare provider about all of your or your child ’ s medical conditions , including if you or your child : • • Have any allergies • • Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant • • Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed • • Have any serious illnesses • • Are taking any medicines ( prescription , over - the - counter , vitamins , or herbal products ) .

The United States FDA has made sotrovimab available under an emergency access mechanism called an Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) .
The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service ( HHS ) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID - 19 pandemic .
Sotrovimab for the treatment of mild - to - moderate symptoms of COVID - 19 in adults and children ( 12 years of age and older weighing at least 88 pounds [ 40 kg ] ) with positive results of SARS - CoV - 2 viral testing , and who are at high risk of progression to severe COVID - 19 , including hospitalization or death , has not undergone the same type of review as an FDA - approved product .
In issuing an EUA under the COVID - 19 public health emergency , the FDA has determined , among other things , that based on the total amount of scientific evidence available , it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective for diagnosing , treating , or preventing COVID - 19 , or a serious or life - threatening disease or condition caused by COVID - 19 ; that the known and potential benefits of the product , when used to diagnose , treat , or prevent such disease or condition , outweigh the known and potential risks of such product ; and that there are no adequate , approved and available alternatives .
All of these criteria must be met to allow for the medicine to be used in the treatment of patients during the COVID ‑ 19 pandemic .
The EUA for sotrovimab is in effect for the duration of the COVID - 19 declaration justifying emergency use of sotrovimab , unless terminated or revoked ( after which sotrovimab may no longer be used under the EUA ) .
