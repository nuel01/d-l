DESCRIPTION Sodium Chloride Processing Solution is a sterile , nonpyrogenic solution in single dose container for use in blood cell processing devices .
It contains no antimicrobial agents .
Composition , osmolarity , pH , and ionic concentration are shown in Table 1 .
Table 10 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Processing Solution Size ( mL ) Composition ( g / L ) Osmolarity ( mOsmol / L ) ( calc ) pH Ionic Concentration ( mEq / L ) Sodium Chloride , USP ( NaCl ) Sodium Chloride 3000 9 308 5 . 5 ( 4 . 5 to 7 . 0 ) 154 154 The plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinyl chloride ( PL 146 Plastic ) .
The amount of water that can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period , e . g . , di - 2 - ethylhexylphthalate ( DEHP ) , up to 5 parts per million .
However , the safety of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Processing Solution has value as a physiological blood cell processing aid .

HOW SUPPLIED 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Processing Solution in Flexible Plastic Container is available as follows : Code Size ( mL ) NDC 2B7207 3000 0338 - 0050 - 47 Exposure of pharmaceutical products to heat should be minimized .
Avoid excessive heat .
It is recommended the product be stored at room temperature ( 25º C ) ; brief exposure up to 40º C does not adversely affect the product .
To Open Tear overwrap down side at slit and remove solution container .
Visually inspect the container .
If the outlet port protector is damaged , detached , or not present , discard container as solution path sterility may be impaired .
Some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed .
This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety .
The opacity will diminish gradually .
Check for minute leaks by squeezing inner bag firmly .
If leaks are found , discard solution as sterility may be impaired .
Preparation for Use • 1 .
Suspend container from eyelet support .
• 2 .
Remove plastic protector from outlet port at bottom of container .
• 3 .
Attach to blood cell processing device .
Refer to complete directions accompanying blood cell processing device .
