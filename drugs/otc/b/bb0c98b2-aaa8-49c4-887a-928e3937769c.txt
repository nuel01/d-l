DESCRIPTION Antigen Laboratories ' Standardized Grass Pollen allergenic extracts are sterile and intended for dilution prior to skin testing and / or immunotherapy .
The route of administration for immunotherapy is subcutaneous .
The routes of administration for diagnostic purposes are intradermal or prick - puncture of the skin .
Standardized Grass Pollen allergenic extract labeled in BAU / ml is not interchangeable with grass pollen extract labeled in AU / ml or with non - standardized grass pollen extract .
Potency of Standardized Grass Pollen allergenic extract is determined by comparison to a Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research ( CBER ) approved reference .
References are available for pollen extracts of Orchard Grass ( Dactylis glomerata ) , Perennial Rye Grass ( Lolium perenne ) , Timothy Grass ( Phleum pratense ) , Redtop Grass ( Agrostis alba ) , Kentucky ( June ) Bluegrass ( Poa pratensis ) , Bermuda Grass ( Cynodon dactylon ) , Meadow Fescue Grass ( Festuca elatior ) , and Sweet Vernal Grass ( Anthoxanthum odoratum ) .
Quantitative skin testing is used by CBER to establish reference ' s potency as Bioequivalent Allergy Units ( BAU ) .
CBER reference labeled 10 , 000 BAU / ml produces a sum of erythema diameter of 50 mm with highly puncture reactive subjects at an intradermal dilution of approximately 1 : 500 , 000 . 11 , 17 CBER references labeled 100 , 000 BAU / ml produce a SumE = 50 mm at an intradermal dilution of 1 : 5 , 000 , 000 .
Relative potency of Standardized Grass Pollen allergenic extracts to CBER reference is determined by Enzyme - linked Immunosorbent Assay ( ELISA ) .
In addition to relative potency testing of Standardized Grass Pollen extract the following testing is performed : 1 .
Microscopic examination to confirm identity and purity of source pollens .
2 .
lsoelectric focusing ( IEF ) pattern of source material is compared to respective CBER reference extract .

Standardized Grass Pollen allergenic extracts are extracted at 1 : 10 weight to volume ( w / v ) ratio of source material to extraction fluid .
Bermuda Grass is only available in 10 , 000 BAU / ml .
Standardized Grass Pollen extracts are diluted after extraction to fall in acceptable relative potency range for a 100 , 000 BAU / ml or 10 , 000 BAU / ml ( Bermuda Grass ) product .
Standardized Grass Pollen allergenic extracts ( except Bermuda ) of 10 , 000 BAU / ml potency are prepared by diluting the 100 , 000 BAU / ml extract 1 : 10 with extracting fluid .
Various mixtures of eight Standardized Grass Pollen extracts are available .
Mixtures of Standardized Grass Pollen extracts with non - standardized grass pollen extracts are available .
Concentrations of Standardized Grass Pollen extracts ( BAU / ml ) and non - standardized grass pollen extracts ( w / v ) in a mixture are printed on the last page of this circular , if applicable .
Active Ingredients : Allergens are described by common and scientific name on container label or last page of this circular .
Preservative is 50 % v / v glycerine .
Inactive ingredients are 0 . 95 % sodium chloride , 0 . 24 % sodium bicarbonate and water for injection .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Studies indicate allergic individuals produce immunoglobulins of the IgE class in response to exposure to grass pollens .
Subsequent exposure to grass pollen results in a combination of allergen with IgE antibody fixed on mast cells or basophil membranes .
This cross - linking results in stimulation of mast cell which leads to release and generation of pharmacologically active substances that produce immediate hypersensitivity reaction . 15 The mode of action of immunotherapy with allergenic extracts is still being investigated .
Subcutaneous injections of increasing doses of allergenic extract into patients with allergic disease have been shown to result in both humoral and cellular changes .
These include production of allergen specific IgG antibodies , suppression of histamine release from target cells , decrease in circulating levels of antigen specific IgE antibody over long periods of time and suppression of peripheral blood T - Iymphocyte cell responses to antigen .
5 , 9 , 10 Puncture and intradermal data from skin testing with CBER grass reference is summarized in Table 1 .
Fifteen patients with clinical symptoms when exposed to grass pollen were included in the study .
The mean sum erythema ( PSumE ) and mean sum wheal ( PSumW ) from puncture testing is listed in Table 1 A .

Confirmation is determined by skin testing .
10 , 000 BAU / ml extracts are intended for percutaneous testing .
If negative , 100 , 000 BAU / ml products can be used for percutaneous test .
Dilutions made from 10 , 000 BAU / ml products are indicated for immunotherapy of previously untreated patients .
If 10 , 000 BAU / ml product is tolerated and symptoms persist , dilutions made from 100 , 000 BAU / ml can be administered .
Standardized Grass Pollen extracts labeled in Bioequivalent Allergy Units ( BAU / ml ) are not interchangeable with grass pollen extracts labeled In Allergy Units ( AU / ml ) or with non - standardized grass pollen extracts .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not administer in the presence of diseases characterized by bleeding diathesis .
Individuals with autoimmune disease may be at risk of exacerbating symptoms of underlying disease , possibly due to routine immunization .
Recent myocardial infarction patients may not tolerate immunotherapy .
Children with nephrotic syndrome probably should not receive injections due to a possibility of immunization causing exacerbation of their nephrotic disease .
Standardized Grass Pollen extract is not intended for the treatment of patients who do not experience allergic symptoms upon natural exposure to the allergen .
Allergenic extracts are not intended for diagnosing patients who do not manifest immediate hypersensitivity reactions to the allergenic extract when skin tested .
WARNINGS Refer to boxed " WARNINGS " , " PRECAUTIONS " , " ADVERSE REACTIONS " and " OVERDOSAGE " sections for additional information on serious adverse reactions and steps to be taken , if any occur .
Extreme caution is necessary when using diagnostic skin tests or injection treatment in highly sensitive patients who have experienced severe symptoms or anaphylaxis by natural exposure , or during previous skin testing or treatment .
IN THESE CASES THE POTENCY FOR SKIN TESTS AND THE ESCALATION OF THE TREATMENT DOSE MUST BE ADJUSTED TO THE PATIENTS SENSITIVITY AND TOLERANCE .
Benefit versus risk needs to be evaluated in steroid dependent asthmatics , patients with unstable asthma or patients with underlying cardiovascular disease .
Injections should never be given intravenously .
A 5 / 8 inch , 25 gauge needle on a sterile syringe allows deep subcutaneous injection .
Withdraw plunger slightly after inserting needle to determine if a blood vessel has been entered .
Proper measurement of dose and caution in making injection will minimize reactions .
Adverse reactions to allergenic extracts are usually apparent within 20 - 30 minutes following injection of immunotherapy .
Extract should be temporarily withheld or dosage reduced in case of any of the following conditions : 1 ) flu or other infection with fever ; 2 ) exposure to excessive amounts of allergen prior to injection ; 3 ) rhinitis and / or asthma exhibiting severe symptoms ; 4 ) adverse reaction to previous injection until cause of reaction has been evaluated by physician supervising patient ' s immunotherapy program .
PRECAUTIONS General : Immunotherapy must be given under physician ' s supervision .
Sterile solutions , vials , syringes , etc . must be used .
Aseptic technique must be observed in making dilutions from stock concentrates .
The usual precautions in administering allergenic extracts are necessary , refer to boxed WARNINGS and " WARNINGS " section .
Sterile syringe and needle must be used for each individual patient to prevent transmission of serum hepatitis , Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) and other infectious agents .
Epinephrine 1 : 1000 should be available .
Refer to " OVERDOSAGE " section for description of treatment for anaphylactic reactions .
Information for Patients : Patient should remain under observation of a nurse , physician , or personnel trained in emergency measures for at least 20 minutes following immunotherapy injection .
Patient must be instructed to report any adverse reactions that occur within 24 hours after injection .
Possible adverse reactions include unusual swelling and / or tenderness at injection site , rhinorrhea , sneezing , coughing , wheezing , shortness of breath , nausea , dizziness , or faintness .
Immediate medical attention must be sought for reactions that occur during or after leaving physician ' s office .
Pregnancy Category C : Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with allergenic extracts .
It is not known whether allergenic extracts cause fetal harm during pregnancy or affect reproductive capacity .
A systemic reaction to allergenic extracts could cause uterine contractions leading to spontaneous abortion or premature labor .
Allergenic extracts should be used during pregnancy only if potential benefit justifies potential risk to fetus . 6 Nursing Mothers : It is not known whether allergenic extracts are excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when allergenic extracts are administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use : Allergenic extracts have been used routinely in children and no special problems of safety or specific hazard have been found .
Children can receive the same dose as adults .
Discomfort is minimized by dividing the dose in half and administering injection at two different sites .
13 , 14 Carcinogenicity , Mutagenicity , Impairment of Fertility : Long term animal studies have not been conducted with Standardized Grass Pollen allergenic extracts to evaluate carcinogenicity , mutagenicity or fertility impairment .
Drug Interactions : Antihistamines .
Antihistamines inhibit the wheal and flare reaction .
The inhibitory effect of conventional antihistamines varies from 1 day up to 10 days , according to the drug and patient ' s sensitivity .
Long acting antihistamines ( e . g . , astemizole ) may inhibit the wheal and flare for up to forty days .
Imipramines .
phenothiazines , and tranquilizers .
Tricyclic antidepressants exert a potent and sustained decrease of skin reactions to histamine .
This effect may last for a few weeks .
Tranquilizers and antiemetic agents of the phenothiazine class have H , antihistaminic activity and can block skin tests . 1 Corticosteroids .
Short - term ( less than 1 week ) administration of corticosteroids at the therapeutic doses used in asthmatic patients does not modify the cutaneous reactivity to histamine , compound 48 / 80 , or allergen .
Long - term corticosteroid therapy modifies the skin texture and makes the interpretation of immediate skin tests more difficult . 1 Theophylline .
It appears that theophylline need not be stopped prior to skin testing . 1 Beta - blockers .
PATIENTS RECEIVING BETA - BLOCKERS MAY NOT BE RESPONSIVE TO EPINEPHRINE OR INHALED BRONCHODILATORS .
The following are commonly prescribed BETA - BLOCKERS : Levatol , Lopressor , Propanolol Intersol , Propanolol HCL , Blocadren , Propanolol , Inderal - LA , Visken , Corgard , Ipran , Tenormin , Timoptic .
Ophthalmic beta - blockers : Betaxolol , Levobunolol , Timolol , Timoptic .
Chemicals that are beta - blockers and may be components of other drugs : Acebutolol , Atenolol , Esmolol , Metoprolol , Nadolol , Penbutolol , Pindolol , Propanolol , Timolol , Labetalol , Carteolol .
Beta - adrenergic agents .
Inhaled beta2 agonists in the usual doses used for the treatment of asthma do not usually inhibit allergen - induced skin tests .
However , oral terbutaline and parenteral ephedrine were shown to decrease the allergen - induced wheal .
Cromolyn .
Cromolyn inhaled or injected prior to skin tests with allergens or degranulating agents does not alter the skin whealing response . 1 Other drugs .
Other drugs have been shown to decrease skin test reactivity .
Among them , dopamine is the best - documented compound . 1 Specific immunotherapy .
A decreased skin test reactivity has been noticed by many authors for patients undergoing specific immunotherapy with pollen extracts , grass pollen allergoids , mite , or hymenoptera venoms , or in professional beekeepers who are spontaneously desensitized .
Finally , it was shown that specific immunotherapy in patients treated with ragweed pollen extract induced a decreased late - phase reaction . 1 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions include , but are not limited to urticaria ; itching ; edema of extremities ; respiratory wheezing or asthma ; dyspnea ; cyanosis ; tachycardia ; lacrimation ; marked perspiration ; flushing of face , neck or upper chest ; mild persistent clearing of throat ; hacking cough or persistent sneezing .
1 ) Local Reactions A mild burning immediately after injection is expected ; this usually subsides in 10 - 20 seconds .
Prolonged pain or pain radiating up arm is usually the result of intramuscular injection , making this injection route undesirable .
Subcutaneous injection is the recommended route .
Small amounts of erythema and swelling at the site of injection are common .
Reactions should not be considered significant unless they persist for at least 24 hours or exceed 50 mm in diameter .
Larger local reactions are not only uncomfortable , but indicate the possibility of a severe systemic reaction if dosage is increased .
In such cases dosage should be reduced to the last level not causing reaction and maintained for two or three treatments before cautiously increasing .
Large , persistent local reactions or minor exacerbations of the patient ' s allergic symptoms may be treated by local cold applications and / or use of oral antihistamines .
2 ) Systemic Reactions Systemic reactions range from mild exaggeration of patient ' s allergic symptoms to anaphylactic reactions . 12 Very sensitive patients may show a rapid response .
It cannot be overemphasized that , under certain unpredictable combinations of circumstances , anaphylactic shock is always a possibility .
Fatalities are rare but can occur . 16 Other possible systemic reaction symptoms are fainting , pallor , bradycardia , hypotension , angioedema , cough , wheezing , conjunctivitis , rhinitis , and urticaria . 8 , 9 Careful attention to dosage and administration limit such reactions .
Allergenic extracts are highly potent to sensitive individuals and OVERDOSE could result in anaphylactic symptoms .
Therefore , it is imperative that physicians administering allergenic extracts understand and prepare for treatment of severe reactions .
Refer to " OVERDOSAGE " section .
OVERDOSAGE Refer to " WARNINGS " , " PRECAUTIONS " , and " ADVERSE REACTIONS " sections for signs and symptoms of overdose .
If a systemic or anaphylactic reaction does occur , apply tourniquet above the site of allergenic extract injection and inject intramuscularly or subcutaneously 0 . 3 to 0 . 5 ml of 1 : 1000 Epinephrine - hydrochloride into the opposite arm or gluteal area .
Repeat dose in 5 - 10 minutes if necessary .
Loosen tourniquet briefly at 5 minute intervals to prevent circulatory impairment .
Discontinue use of the tourniquet after hour .
The epinephrine HCL 1 : 1000 dose for infants to 2 years is 0 . 05 to 0 . 1 ml ; for children 2 to 6 years it is 0 . 15 ml ; for children 6 to 12 years it is 0 . 2 ml .
Symptoms of progressive anaphylaxis include airway obstruction and / or vascular collapse .
After administration of epinephrine , profound shock and vasomotor collapse should be treated with intravenous fluids and possibly vasoactive drugs .
Monitor airways for obstruction .
Oxygen should be given by mask if indicated .
Antihistamines , H2 antagonist , bronchodilators , steroids and theophylline may be used as indicated after giving adequate epinephrine and circulatory support . 12 Patients who have been taking a beta - blocker may be unresponsive to epinephrine or beta - adrenergic drugs ( Alupent ) .
These drugs should be administered even though a beta - blocker may have been taken .
The following treatment will be effective whether or not patient is taking a beta - blocker : Aminophylline IV , slow push or drip , Atrovent ( Ipratropium bromide ) Inhaler , 3 inhalations repeated , Atropine , 0 . 4 mg / ml , 0 . 75 to 1 . 5 ml lM or IV , Solu - Cortef , 100 - 200 mg IM or IV , Solu - Medrol , 125 mg IM or IV , Glucagon , 0 . 5 - 1 mg IM or IV , Benadryl , 50 mg IM or IV , Cimetidine , 300 mg IM or IV , Oxygen via ambu bag .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Refer to " STORAGE " section for proper storage condition for allergenic extract .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
Some allergenic extracts naturally precipitate .
Precaution is necessary when using grass pollen extract mixtures .
Potency may be additive and may equal the total potency of the grass pollen extracts in the mixture .
Careful attention to container label and / or package insert in regard to BAU / ml of grass pollen extracts from which mixture is derived is important .
Physicians undertaking immunotherapy should be concerned with patient ' s degree of sensitivity .
The initial dilution of allergenic extract , starting dose and progression of dosage must be carefully determined on the basis of the patient ' s history and results of skin tests .
( SEE " INDICATIONS AND USAGE " section . )
Strongly positive skin tests may be risk factors for systemic reactions .
Less aggressive immunotherapy schedules may be indicated for such patients .
PRICK - PUNCTURE TESTING : To identify grass sensitive individuals and as a safety precaution , it is recommended that a prick or puncture test be performed prior to initiating very dilute intradermal testing .
Prick ( puncture ) testing is performed by placing a drop of extract on skin and puncturing skin through the drop with a prick - puncture device .
The most satisfactory sites on the back for skin testing are from posterior axillary fold to 2 . 5 cm from the spinal column , and from the top of the scapula to the lower rib margins .
The best areas on the arms are the volar surfaces from the axilla to 2 . 5 or 5 cm above the wrist , skipping the anticubital space .
It is recommended that 10 , 000 BAU / ml Standardized Grass Pollen extract be used for initial puncture testing because 100 , 000 BAU / ml extracts produce very large puncture reactions in highly reactive individuals . 18 A positive reaction is approximately 10 - 15 mm erythema with 2 . 5 mm wheal .
Smaller , less conclusive reactions may be considered positive in conjunction with a definitive history of symptoms on exposure to allergen .
Less sensitive individuals can be tested intradermally with appropriately diluted extract .
( See Intradermal Testing . )
A positive control using histamine phosphate identifies patients whose skin may not react due to medications , metabolic or other reasons .
A negative control ( 50 % glycerine for prick - puncture testing ) would exclude false - positive reactions due to ingredients in diluent or patients who have dermatographism .

A sterile , disposable syringe and needle is used for each extract tested .
Intracutaneous test dilutions should be made with aqueous diluent .
Three - fold , five - fold or ten - fold dilutions may be prepared from stock concentrates .
( 1 ) Start testing with the most dilute allergenic extract concentration .
( 2 ) A volume of 0 . 01 - 0 . 02 ml should be injected slowly into the superficial skin layers making a small bleb ( superficial wheal ) .
( 3 ) For patients with grass sensitivity based on puncture reactivity , a concentration of approximately 0 . 02 BAU / ml ( 10 , 000 BAU / ml 5 - 8 or 10 - 6 or 100 , 000 BAU / mI 5 - 10 or 10 - 7 dilution ) should be used for initial skin testing ( " CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY " , Table 1 B ) .
Reactions to skin testing are graded 0 to 4 + according to size of wheal and erythema produced ( refer to chart below ) .
The reactions should be read after fifteen minutes .
EVALUATION OF SKIN REACTIONS GRADE mm ERYTHEMA mm WHEAL 0 less than 5 less than 5 + / - 5 - 10 5 - 10 1 + 11 - 20 5 - 10 2 + 21 - 30 5 - 10 3 + 31 - 40 10 - 15 or with pseudopods 4 + greater than 40 greater than 15 or with many pseudopods If after twenty minutes no skin reaction is observed , continued testing using increments of the concentration until a reaction of 5 - 10 mm wheal and 10 - 30 mm erythema is obtained , or a concentration of 5 - 2 or 10 - 1 if using 10 , 000 BAU / ml extract has been tested .
A positive control of histamine phosphate and a negative control of 50 % v / v glycerine diluted with diluent to 5 - 2 ( 1 : 25 ) or 10 - 1 ( 1 : 10 ) dilution , should be included in interpretation of intradermal testing . 1 INTRADERMAL TESTING - SKIN ENDPOINT TITRATION : Patient ' s degree of sensitivity and the initial dose of allergen to be used in immunotherapy can be quantitated using five - fold dilutions of allergenic extract for intracutaneous testing .
Intracutaneously inject 0 . 01 - 0 . 02 ml of the test allergen to form a 4 mm diameter superficial wheal .
A concentration of 0 . 02 BAU / ml is a safe initial dilution ( " CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY " , Table 1 B ) .
When a sequence of five - fold or ten - fold dilutions of an allergen are injected , the endpoint is determined by noting the dilution that first produces a wheal and erythema ( 15 minutes after injection ) that is 2 mm larger than wheals with erythema produced by weaker , nonreacting dilutions ( 5 mm negative wheal ) .
The endpoint dilution is used as a starting dose concentration for immunotherapy .
IMMUNOTHERAPY : Normally , immunotherapy can be started with 0 . 15 ml of the dilution of allergenic extract causing the endpoint reaction .
In any allergic patient , a safe starting dose can be determined by finding the first dose by intradermal skin testing producing a 1 + reaction or the dilution producing the skin endpoint .
Increasing doses of 5 - 20 % increments can be administered providing initial or preceding dose is tolerated without significant local reactions .
The rate of increase in dosage in the early stages of treatment with highly diluted extracts is usually more rapid than the rate of increase possible with more concentrated extracts .
This schedule is intended only as a guide and must be modified according to the reactivity of the individual patient .
Physicians must proceed cautiously in the treatment of highly sensitive patients who develop large local or systemic reactions .
Some patients may tolerate larger doses of the allergenic extract depending on patient response . 3 Because diluted extracts lose activity on storage , the first dose from a more concentrated vial should be the same or less than the previous dose . 4 , 7 Dosages progressively increase according to the tolerance of the patient at intervals of one to seven days until : ( 1 ) the patient achieves relief of symptoms ; ( 2 ) induration at the site of injection is no larger than 50 mm in 36 to 48 hours ; ( 3 ) a maintenance dose is reached ( the largest dose tolerated by the patient that relieves symptoms without undesirable local or systemic reactions ) .
This maintenance dose may be continued at regular intervals perennially .
It may be necessary to adjust the progression of dosage downward to avoid local and constitutional reactions . 2 The usual duration of treatment has not been established .
A period of two or three years on immunotherapy constitutes an average minimum course of treatment .
SWITCHING FROM NON - STANDARDIZED TO STANDARDIZED GRASS POLLEN EXTRACT : Caution is imperative when switching from non - standardized grass pollen to Standardized Grass Pollen extracts .
Standardized Grass Pollens may have equal , greater , or lesser potency than non - standardized grass pollen ( " CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY " , Table 2 ) .
Patient skin testing , utilizing side by side endpoint titration , can be used to determine the relative potency of standardized to non - standardized grass pollen extract .
Based on their relative potency , a dose equipotent to the non - standardized extract can be administered .
For example , a five fold dilution of standardized extract producing the identical skin responses as the non - standardized grass pollen concentrate would require five fold reduction of dose .
( If patient had been receiving 0 . 1 ml of non - standardized extract concentrate , then they should now receive 0 . 1 ml of 1 : 5 dilution of the Standardized Grass Pollen extract . )
Alternately , standardized extract or a mix containing Standardized Grass Pollen extract can be administered as though the patient were newly beginning immunotherapy ; i . e . the patient can be skin tested to determine a safe initial dose .
HOW SUPPLIED Standardized Grass Pollen allergenic extract concentration is expressed in BAU / ml .
It is supplied in 100 , 000 BAU / ml and 10 , 000 BAU / ml in 10 , 30 and 50 ml containers .
Standardized Bermuda Grass is only available as 10 , 000 BAU / ml concentrate .
Stock mixtures of Standardized Grass Pollens and mixtures of standardized and non - standardized grass pollens are available at various concentrations .
Extracts in 5 ml dropper bottles are available for prick - puncture testing .
To insure maximum potency for the entire dating period , all stock concentrates contain 50 % v / v glycerine .
STORAGE Store all stock concentrates and dilutions at 2 - 8 degrees C . Keep at this temperature during office use .
The expiration date of allergenic extracts is listed on the container label .
Dilutions of allergenic extracts containing less than 50 % v / v glycerine are less stable than those containing at least 50 % v / v glycerine .
If loss of potency is suspected , potency can be checked using side by side skin testing with freshly prepared dilutions of equal concentration on individuals with known sensitivity to the allergen .
