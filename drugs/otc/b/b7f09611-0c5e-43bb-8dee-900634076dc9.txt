Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Cardiovascular Disorders : hypertension , hypotension Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders : metabolic acidosis , hypocalcemia 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Renal Impairment : Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypernatremia and hypokalemia more closely if the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) falls below 60 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 .
( 5 . 2 , 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on PEDMARK used in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug - associated risk .
Oral or intravenous administration of sodium thiosulfate during the period of organogenesis resulted in no signs of malformations or lethality , but at doses and exposures that were lower than those in humans ( see Data ) .
PEDMARK is administered following cisplatin infusions , which can cause embryo - fetal harm .
Refer to cisplatin prescribing information for additional information .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In animal studies , sodium thiosulfate was not embryotoxic or teratogenic in pregnant mice , rats , hamsters , or rabbits at daily ( 5 to 13 daily doses during the period of organogenesis ) oral maternal doses of up to 550 , 400 , 400 , and 580 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 08 to 0 . 35 times the highest clinical dose of 20 g / m2 based on body surface area [ BSA ] ) , respectively , of sodium thiosulfate ; exposure in these animals compared to humans may be much lower due to poor oral bioavailability .
Sodium thiosulfate was not embryotoxic or teratogenic in hamsters following a total daily dose of 1500 mg / kg ( 0 . 38 times the highest clinical dose of 20 g / m2 based on BSA ) .
Additionally , an intravenous pharmacokinetic study in gravid ewes indicated that sodium thiosulfate does not cross the placenta .
8 . 2 Lactation There are no data on the presence of sodium thiosulfate in human milk or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production .
PEDMARK is administered in combination with cisplatin .
Refer to cisplatin prescribing information for additional information .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of PEDMARK have been established to reduce the risk of ototoxicity associated with cisplatin in pediatric patients 1 month of age and older with localized , non - metastatic solid tumors .
The safety and effectiveness of PEDMARK have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 1 month old or in pediatric patients with metastatic cancer .
PEDMARK is not recommended in pediatric patients younger than 1 month old due to the increased risk of hypernatremia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Sodium thiosulfate is substantially excreted by the kidney [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment or end - stage renal disease .
Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypernatremia and hypokalemia more closely if the GFR falls below 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION Sodium thiosulfate anhydrous is an inorganic salt with a molecular formula of Na2S2O3 and a molecular weight of 158 . 11 g / mol .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] It is a white to off - white crystalline solid that is soluble in water , but insoluble in alcohol .
The aqueous solution has a pH ranging from 6 . 5 to 8 . 0 .
PEDMARK ( sodium thiosulfate injection ) is a sterile , preservative - free , clear , colorless solution in a single - dose vial for intravenous use with a pH between 7 and 9 .
Each vial contains the equivalent of 12 . 5 grams of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate ( provided as sodium thiosulfate anhydrous 8 grams ) in 100 mL solution ( 125 mg / mL ) .
Each mL contains the equivalent of 125 mg of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate ( provided as sodium thiosulfate anhydrous 80 mg ) and 0 . 25 mg boric acid .
Sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid may have been used for pH adjustment .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Cisplatin - induced ototoxicity is caused by irreversible damage to hair cells in the cochlea hypothesized to be due to a combination of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production and direct alkylation of DNA leading to cell death .
Sodium thiosulfate interacts directly with cisplatin to produce an inactive platinum species .
In addition , sodium thiosulfate can enter cells through the sodium sulfate cotransporter 2 and cause intracellular effects such as the increase in antioxidant glutathione levels and inhibition of intracellular oxidative stress .
Both activities may contribute to the ability of sodium thiosulfate to reduce the risk of ototoxicity .
Concurrent incubation of sodium thiosulfate with cisplatin decreased the in vitro cytotoxicity of cisplatin to tumor cells ; delaying the addition of sodium thiosulfate to these cultures prevented the protective effect .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Serum Sodium Level A 20 g / m2 dose delivers a sodium load of 162 mmol / m2 , a 15 g / m2 dose delivers a sodium load of 121 mmol / m2 , and a 10 g / m2 dose delivers a sodium load of 81 mmol / m2 .
In SIOPEL 6 , the recommended dosage resulted in an average transient increase in serum sodium levels of approximately 6 mmol / L at 1 hour after infusion [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] and levels had returned to baseline by 18 hours or 24 hours after administration .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of thiosulfate was assessed in pediatric patients .
At the recommended dosage , the mean ( ± SD ) maximum concentration ( Cmax ) was 13 ± 1 . 2 mM .
The Cmax of thiosulfate increased proportionally to dose over the range of 4 g / m2 to 20 g / m2 .
No accumulation of thiosulfate is expected following administration of PEDMARK on two consecutive days .
Distribution Sodium thiosulfate does not bind to human plasma proteins .
Sodium thiosulfate is an inorganic salt and thiosulfate anions do not readily cross cell membranes .
The mean volume of distribution of thiosulfate is 0 . 23 L / kg .
Elimination The mean half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of thiosulfate is approximately 20 minutes to 50 minutes .
The mean total clearance of thiosulfate is 2 . 2 mL / min / kg in patients with fully developed renal function ( age approximately 1 year ) .
Renal clearance accounts for approximately 50 % of total clearance in patients with fully developed renal function .
Metabolism Thiosulfate is an endogenous intermediate product of sulfur - containing amino acid metabolism .
Thiosulfate is metabolized through thiosulfate sulfur transferase and thiosulfate reductase to sulfite , which is oxidized to sulfate .
Excretion After administration of sodium thiosulfate , approximately 50 % of the administered sodium thiosulfate was excreted unchanged in urine and > 95 % of the dose excreted in urine occurs within the first 4 hours after administration .
Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Thiosulfate Cmax increased approximately 25 % and AUC increased approximately 2 - fold in subjects on hemodialysis ( GFR 0 to 6 mL / min / 1 . 72 m2 , estimated by the modification of diet in renal disease [ MDRD ] equation ) compared to subjects with normal renal function ( GFR > 70 mL / min / 1 . 72 m2 , MDRD ) .
Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 Enzymes : Sodium thiosulfate is an inducer of CYP2B6 but not of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 .
Sodium thiosulfate is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the potential carcinogenicity of sodium thiosulfate .
In an in vitro Bacterial Reverse Mutation Assay ( Ames Assay ) , sodium thiosulfate was not mutagenic in the absence of metabolic activation in S . typhimurium strains TA98 , TA100 , TA1535 , TA1537 , or TA1538 , nor in the presence of metabolic activation in strains TA98 , TA1535 , TA1537 , or TA1538 or E . coli strain WP2 .
Sodium thiosulfate at up to 1000 µM did not increase the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges in human lymphocytes in vitro .
There are no animal studies examining the effects of sodium thiosulfate on fertility .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of PEDMARK in reducing the risk of cisplatin - associated ototoxicity was evaluated in two multicenter studies : SIOPEL 6 and COG ACCL0431 .
SIOPEL 6 SIOPEL 6 ( NCT00652132 ) was a multicenter , randomized , controlled , open - label study .
