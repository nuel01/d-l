1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE AK - FLUOR ® 10 % ( 100 mg / mL ) and 25 % ( 250 mg / mL ) is indicated in diagnostic fluorescein angiography or angioscopy of the retina and iris vasculature .
AK - FLUOR ® is indicated in diagnostic fluorescein angiography or angioscopy of the retina and iris vasculature .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • The normal adult dose of AK - FLUOR ® 10 % is 5 mL ( 500 mg ) and of AK - FLUOR ® 25 % is 2 mL ( 500 mg ) via intravenous administration .
( 2 . 1 ) • For children , the dose should be calculated on the basis of 35 mg for each ten pounds of body weight ( 7 . 7 mg / kg body weight ) .
( 2 . 2 ) • Do not mix or dilute with other solutions or drugs .
( 2 . 2 ) 2 . 1 Dosing Adult Dose The recommended dosage of AK - FLUOR ® 10 % ( 100 mg / mL ) and of 25 % ( 250 mg / mL ) is 500 mg via intravenous administration .
Pediatric Dose For children , the dose is 7 . 7 mg / kg ( actual body weight ) up to a maximum of 500 mg , via intravenous infusion calculated on the basis of 35 mg for each 10 lbs .
( 4 . 54 kg ) of body weight .
2 . 2 Preparation for Administration Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration .
Do not mix or dilute with other solutions or drugs .
2 . 3 Administration Inject the dose ( over 5 - 10 seconds is normally recommended ) into the antecubital vein , after taking precautions to avoid extravasation .
A syringe , filled with AK - FLUOR ® , may be attached to transparent tubing and a 23 gauge butterfly needle for injection .
Insert the needle and draw the patient ' s blood to the hub of the syringe so that a small air bubble separates the patient ' s blood in the tubing from the fluorescein .
With the room lights on , slowly inject the blood back into the vein while watching the skin over the needle tip .
If the needle has extravasated , the patient ' s blood will be seen to bulge the skin and the injection should be stopped before any fluorescein is injected .
When assured that extravasation has not occurred , the room light may be turned off and the fluorescein injection completed .
Luminescence usually appears in the retina and choroidal vessels in 7 to 14 seconds and can be observed by standard viewing equipment .
Reduction in dose from 500 mg to 200 mg of AK - FLUOR ® 10 % may be appropriate in cases when a highly sensitive imaging system e . g . , scanning laser ophthalmoscope is used .

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Respiratory reactions .
( 5 . 1 ) • Severe local tissue damage .
( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Respiratory Reactions Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of allergy or bronchial asthma .
An emergency tray should always be available .
If a potential allergy is suspected , an intradermal skin test may be performed prior to intravenous administration , i . e . , 0 . 05 mL injected intradermally to be evaluated 30 to 60 minutes following injection .
Given the sensitivity and specificity of skin testing , a negative skin test is not proof that a patient is not allergic to fluorescein .
5 . 2 Severe local tissue damage Extravasation during injection can result in severe local tissue damage due to high pH of fluorescein solution .
The following complications resulting from extravasation of fluorescein have been noted to occur : Sloughing of the skin , superficial phlebitis , subcutaneous granuloma , and toxic neuritis along the median nerve in the antecubital area .
Complications resulting from extravasation can cause severe pain in the arm for up to several hours .
When extravasation occurs , the injection should be discontinued and conservative measures to treat damaged tissue and to relieve pain should be implemented .

11 DESCRIPTION AK - FLUOR ® ( fluorescein injection , USP ) is a sterile solution for use intravenously as a diagnostic aid .
It is a dark reddish orange solution with a pH of 8 . 3 to 9 . 8 and an osmolality of 572 to 858 mOsm / kg for the 10 % and 1800 to 2200 mOsm / kg for the 25 % .
Its chemical name is spiro [ isobenzofuran - 1 ( 3 H ) , 9 ' - [ 9 H ] xanthene ] - 3 - one , 3 ' 6 ' - dihydroxy , disodium salt .
The active ingredient is represented by the chemical structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] MW = 376 . 27 AK - FLUOR ® 10 % contains : Active : fluorescein sodium ( equivalent to fluorescein 10 % w / v , 100 mg / mL ) Inactives : Sodium Hydroxide and / or Hydrochloric Acid may be used to adjust pH ( 8 . 3 to 9 . 8 ) , and Water for Injection .
AK - FLUOR ® 25 % contains : Active : fluorescein sodium ( equivalent to fluorescein 25 % w / v , 250 mg / mL ) Inactives : Sodium Hydroxide and / or Hydrochloric Acid may be used to adjust pH ( 8 . 3 to 9 . 8 ) , and Water for Injection .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Fluorescein sodium responds to electromagnetic radiation and light between the wavelengths of 465 to 490 nm and fluoresces , i . e . , emits light at wavelengths of 520 to 530 nm .
Thus , the hydrocarbon is excited by blue light and emits light that appears yellowish green .
Following intravenous injection of fluorescein sodium in an aqueous solution , the unbound fraction of the fluorescein can be excited with a blue light flash from a fundus camera as it circulates through the ocular vasculature , and the yellowish green fluorescence of the dye is captured by the camera .
In the fundus , the fluorescence of the dye demarcates the retinal and / or choroidal vasculature under observation , distinguishing it from adjacent areas / structures .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution .
Within 7 to 14 seconds after IV administration into the antecubital vein , fluorescein usually appears in the central retinal artery of the eye .
Within a few minutes of IV administration of fluorescein sodium , a yellowish discoloration of the skin occurs , which begins to fade 6 to 12 hours after dosing .
Various estimates of volume of distribution indicate that fluorescein distributes into interstitial space ( 0 . 5 L / kg ) .
Metabolism .
Fluorescein is metabolized to fluorescein monoglucuronide .
After IV administration of fluorescein sodium ( 14 mg / kg ) to 7 healthy subjects , approximately 80 % of fluorescein in plasma was converted to glucuronide conjugate after a period of 1 hour post dose .
Excretion .
Fluorescein and its metabolite are mainly eliminated via renal excretion .
After IV administration , the urine remains slightly fluorescent for 24 to 36 hours .
A renal clearance of 1 . 75 mL / min / kg and a hepatic clearance ( due to conjugation ) of 1 . 50 mL / min / kg have been estimated .
The systemic clearance of fluorescein was essentially complete by 48 to 72 hours after administration of 500 mg fluorescein .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility There have been no long - term studies done using fluorescein in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential .
