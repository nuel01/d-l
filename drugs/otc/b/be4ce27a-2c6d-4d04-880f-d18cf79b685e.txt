6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In two vehicle - controlled and one active - controlled U . S . clinical trials , treatment safety was monitored in 788 subjects who used twice - daily FINACEA Gel for 12 weeks ( N = 333 ) or 15 weeks ( N = 124 ) , or the gel vehicle ( N = 331 ) for 12 weeks .
In all three trials , the most common treatment - related adverse events were : burning / stinging / tingling ( 29 % ) , pruritus ( 11 % ) , scaling / dry skin / xerosis ( 8 % ) and erythema / irritation ( 4 % ) .
In the active - controlled trial , overall adverse reactions ( including burning , stinging / tingling , dryness / tightness / scaling , itching , and erythema / irritation / redness ) were 19 . 4 % ( 24 / 124 ) for FINACEA Gel compared to 7 . 1 % ( 9 / 127 ) for the active comparator gel at 15 weeks .

In patients using azelaic acid formulations , the following adverse events have been reported : worsening of asthma , vitiligo , depigmentation , small depigmented spots , hypertrichosis , reddening ( signs of keratosis pilaris ) and exacerbation of recurrent herpes labialis .
Local Tolerability Studies FINACEA Gel and its vehicle caused irritant reactions at the application site in human dermal safety studies .
FINACEA Gel caused significantly more irritation than its vehicle in a cumulative irritation study .
Some improvement in irritation was demonstrated over the course of the clinical trials , but this improvement might be attributed to subject dropouts .
No phototoxicity or photoallergenicity were reported in human dermal safety studies .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified post approval of FINACEA Gel .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure : Eyes : iridocyclitis upon accidental exposure of the eyes to FINACEA Gel .
Hypersensitivity : angioedema , eye swelling , facial swelling , urticaria .
Respiratory : worsening of asthma , dyspnea , wheezing .
Skin reactions : application site rash .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Azelaic acid is minimally absorbed systemically following topical route of administration , and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In animal reproduction studies , embryofetal toxicity was noted when azelaic acid was administered orally during the period of organogenesis at doses 162 , 19 , and 65 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) in rats , rabbits , and monkeys , respectively .
Maternal toxicity was noted at these doses but no malformations were observed in these embryofetal developmental studies ( see Data ) .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Dermal embryofetal developmental toxicology studies have not been performed with azelaic acid , 15 % gel .
Oral embryofetal developmental studies were conducted with azelaic acid in rats , rabbits , and cynomolgus monkeys .
Azelaic acid was administered during the period of organogenesis in all three animal species .
Embryotoxicity was observed in rats , rabbits , and monkeys at oral doses of azelaic acid that generated some maternal toxicity .
Embryotoxicity was observed in rats given 2500 mg / kg / day [ 162 times the MRHD based on body surface area ( BSA ) comparison ] , rabbits given 150 or 500 mg / kg / day ( 19 or 65 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison ) and cynomolgus monkeys given 500 mg / kg / day ( 65 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison ) azelaic acid .
No malformations were observed in the oral embryofetal developmental studies conducted in rats , rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys .
An oral peri - and post - natal developmental study was conducted in rats .
Azelaic acid was administered from gestational day 15 through day 21 postpartum up to a dose level of 2500 mg / kg / day .
Embryotoxicity was observed in rats at an oral dose of 2500 mg / kg / day ( 162 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison ) that generated some maternal toxicity .
In addition , slight disturbances in the post - natal development of fetuses was noted in rats at oral doses that generated some maternal toxicity ( 500 and 2500 mg / kg / day ; 32 and 162 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison ) .
No effects on sexual maturation of the fetuses were noted in this study .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Azelaic acid is naturally present in human milk .
When used as prescribed , azelaic acid is unlikely to be absorbed through the skin in clinically relevant amounts to cause a change in azelaic acid concentration in milk or milk production ; therefore , breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the infant to FINACEA Gel .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for FINACEA Gel and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from FINACEA Gel or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of FINACEA Gel have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of FINACEA Gel did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine if they respond differently than younger subjects .
11 DESCRIPTION FINACEA ( azelaic acid ) Gel , 15 % , is an aqueous gel which contains azelaic acid , a naturally - occurring saturated dicarboxylic acid .
It is for topical use .
Chemically , azelaic acid is 1 , 7 - heptanedicarboxylic acid .
The molecular formula for azelaic acid is C9 H16 O4 .
It has the following structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Azelaic acid has a molecular weight of 188 . 22 .
It is a white , odorless crystalline solid .
It is poorly soluble in water at 20 ° C ( 0 . 24 % ) but freely soluble in boiling water and in ethanol .
FINACEA Gel , 15 % is a white to yellowish white opaque gel for topical use ; each gram contains 0 . 15 gm azelaic acid ( 15 % w / w ) in an aqueous gel base containing benzoic acid ( as a preservative ) , disodium EDTA , lecithin , medium - chain triglycerides , polyacrylic acid , polysorbate 80 , propylene glycol , purified water , and sodium hydroxide to adjust pH . [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism ( s ) by which azelaic acid interferes with the pathogenic events in rosacea are unknown .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of azelaic acid in association with the treatment of rosacea are unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The percutaneous absorption of azelaic acid after topical application of FINACEA Gel could not be reliably determined .
Mean plasma azelaic acid concentrations in rosacea subjects treated with FINACEA Gel twice daily for at least 8 weeks are in the range of 42 to 63 . 1 ng / mL .
These values are within the maximum concentration range of 24 . 0 to 90 . 5 ng / mL observed in rosacea subjects treated with vehicle only .
This indicates that FINACEA Gel does not increase plasma azelaic acid concentration beyond the range derived from nutrition and endogenous metabolism .
In vitro and human data suggest negligible cutaneous metabolism of 3 H - azelaic acid after topical application of 20 % azelaic acid cream .
Azelaic acid is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine , but undergoes some β - oxidation to shorter chain dicarboxylic acids .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a 2 - year dermal mouse carcinogenicity study , azelaic acid pre - foam emulsion was administered twice daily to CD - 1 mice at topical doses of 5 % , 15 % , and 30 % ( 500 , 1500 , and 3000 mg / kg / day azelaic acid ) .
No drug - related tumors were noted at concentrations up to 30 % azelaic acid ( 396 times the MRHD based on AUC comparison ) .
Azelaic acid was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in vitro [ Ames assay , HGPRT in V79 cells ( Chinese hamster lung cells ) , and chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes ] and in vivo ( dominant lethal assay in mice and mouse micronucleus assay ) genotoxicity tests .
Oral administration of azelaic acid at dose levels up to 2500 mg / kg / day ( 162 times the MRHD based on BSA comparison ) did not affect fertility or reproductive performance in male or female rats .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES FINACEA Gel was evaluated for the treatment of mild to moderate papulopustular rosacea in two multicenter , randomized , double - blind , vehicle - controlled , 12 - week clinical trials having identical protocols and involving a total of 664 ( active : 333 ; vehicle : 331 ) subjects aged 21 to 86 years ( mean age = 49 ) .
Overall , 92 . 5 % of subjects were Caucasian and 73 % of subjects were female .
Enrolled subjects had mild to moderate rosacea with a mean lesion count of 18 ( range 8 to 60 ) inflammatory papules and pustules .
The following subjects were excluded : a ) those without papules and pustules ; b ) those with nodules , rhinophyma , or ocular involvement and c ) those with a history of hypersensitivity to propylene glycol or to any other ingredients of the study drug .
FINACEA Gel or its vehicle were to be applied twice daily for 12 weeks ; no other topical or systemic medication affecting the course of rosacea and / or evaluability was to be used during the studies .
Subjects were instructed to avoid spicy foods , thermally hot food / drink and alcoholic beverages during the study .
Subjects were also instructed to use only very mild soaps or soapless cleansing lotion for facial cleansing .
The primary efficacy endpoints included both 1 ) change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts as well as 2 ) success defined as a score of " clear " or " minimal " with at least a 2 - step reduction from baseline on the Investigator ' s Global Assessment ( IGA ) , defined as follows below : CLEAR : No papules and / or pustules ; no or residual erythema ; no or mild to moderate telangiectasia MINIMAL : Rare papules and / or pustules ; residual to mild erythema ; mild to moderate telangiectasia MILD : Few papules and / or pustules ; mild erythema ; mild to moderate telangiectasia MILD TO MODERATE : Distinct number of papules and / or pustules ; mild to moderate erythema ; mild to moderate telangiectasia MODERATE : Pronounced number of papules and / or pustules ; moderate erythema ; mild to moderate telangiectasia MODERATE TO SEVERE : Many papules and / or pustules , occasionally with large inflamed lesions ; moderate erythema ; moderate degree of telangiectasia SEVERE : Numerous papules and / or pustules , occasionally with confluent areas of inflamed lesions ; moderate or severe erythema ; moderate or severe telangiectasia Primary efficacy assessment was based on the " intent - to - treat " ( ITT ) population with the " last observation carried forward " ( LOCF ) .
Both trials demonstrated a statistically significant difference in favor of FINACEA Gel over its vehicle in both reducing the number of inflammatory papules and pustules associated with rosacea ( Table 2 ) as well as demonstrating success on the IGA in the ITT - LOCF population at the end of treatment .
Table 2 : Inflammatory Papules and Pustules ( ITT population ) [ 1 ] Study One FINACEA Gel , 15 % N = 164 Study One VEHICLE N = 165 Study Two FINACEA Gel , 15 % N = 167 Study Two VEHICLE N = 166 Mean Lesion Count Baseline 17 . 5 17 . 6 17 . 9 18 . 5 End of Treatment null 6 . 8 10 . 5 9 . 0 12 . 1 Mean Percent Reduction End of Treatment null 57 . 9 % 39 . 9 % 50 . 0 % 38 . 2 % [ 1 ] ITT population with last observation carried forward ( LOCF ) Although some reduction of erythema which was present in subjects with papules and pustules of rosacea occurred in clinical trials , efficacy for treatment of erythema in rosacea in the absence of papules and pustules has not been evaluated .
FINACEA Gel was superior to the vehicle with regard to success based on the IGA of rosacea on a 7 - point static score at the end of treatment ( ITT population ; Table 3 ) .
