Dosing should be titrated based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability .
Lower Prograf dosages than the recommended initial dosage may be sufficient as maintenance therapy .
Adjunct therapy with adrenal corticosteroids is recommended early post - transplant .
The data in kidney transplant patients indicate that the Black patients required a higher dose to attain comparable trough concentrations compared to Caucasian patients ( Table 2 ) .
Table 2 .
Comparative Dose and Trough Concentrations Based on RaceTime After Transplant Caucasian n = 114 Black n = 56 Dose ( mg / kg ) Trough Concentrations ( ng / mL ) Dose ( mg / kg ) Trough Concentrations ( ng / mL ) Day 7 0 . 18 12 . 0 0 . 23 10 . 9 Month 1 0 . 17 12 . 8 0 . 26 12 . 9 Month 6 0 . 14 11 . 8 0 . 24 11 . 5 Month 12 0 . 13 10 . 1 0 . 19 11 . 0 Initial Dose – Injection Prograf injection should be used only as a continuous IV infusion and when the patient cannot tolerate oral administration of Prograf capsules .
Prograf injection should be discontinued as soon as the patient can tolerate oral administration of Prograf capsules , usually within 2 - 3 days .
In a patient receiving an IV infusion , the first dose of oral therapy should be given 8 - 12 hours after discontinuing the IV infusion .
The observed trough concentrations described above pertain to oral administration of Prograf only ; while monitoring Prograf concentrations in patients receiving Prograf injection as a continuous IV infusion may have some utility , the observed concentrations will not represent comparable exposures to those estimated by the trough concentrations observed in patients on oral therapy .
The recommended starting dose of Prograf injection is 0 . 03 - 0 . 05 mg / kg / day in kidney and liver transplant and 0 . 01 mg / kg / day in heart transplant given as a continuous IV infusion .
Adult patients should receive doses at the lower end of the dosing range .
Concomitant adrenal corticosteroid therapy is recommended early post - transplantation .
Anaphylactic reactions have occurred with injectables containing castor oil derivatives , such as Prograf injection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) ] .
2 . 2 Dosage in Pediatric Liver Transplant Patients The initial oral dosage recommendations for pediatric patients with liver transplants along with recommendations for whole blood trough concentrations are shown in Table 3 .
For blood concentration monitoring details see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) .
If necessary , pediatric patients may start on an IV dose of 0 . 03 - 0 . 05 mg / kg / day .
Table 3 .
Summary of Initial Oral Dosage Recommendations and Observed Whole Blood Trough Concentrations in ChildrenPatient Population Recommended Prograf Initial Oral Dosage Note : daily doses should be administered as two divided doses , every 12 hours Observed Tacrolimus Whole Blood Trough Concentrations Pediatric liver transplant patients 0 . 15 - 0 . 20 mg / kg / day Month 1 - 12 : 5 - 20 ng / mL Pediatric liver transplantation patients without pre - existing renal or hepatic dysfunction have required and tolerated higher doses than adults to achieve similar blood concentrations .
Experience in pediatric kidney and heart transplantation patients is limited .
2 . 3 Dosage Adjustment in Patients with Renal Impairment Due to its potential for nephrotoxicity , consideration should be given to dosing Prograf at the lower end of the therapeutic dosing range in patients who have received a liver or heart transplant and have pre - existing renal impairment .
Further reductions in dose below the targeted range may be required .
In kidney transplant patients with post - operative oliguria , the initial dose of Prograf should be administered no sooner than 6 hours and within 24 hours of transplantation , but may be delayed until renal function shows evidence of recovery .
2 . 4 Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Due to the reduced clearance and prolonged half - life , patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh ≥ 10 ) may require lower doses of Prograf .
Close monitoring of blood concentrations is warranted .
The use of Prograf in liver transplant recipients experiencing post - transplant hepatic impairment may be associated with increased risk of developing renal insufficiency related to high whole - blood concentrations of tacrolimus .
These patients should be monitored closely and dosage adjustments should be considered .
Some evidence suggests that lower doses should be used in these patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 5 Administration Instructions It is recommended that patients initiate oral therapy with Prograf capsules if possible .
Initial dosage and observed tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations for adults are shown in Table 1 and for pediatrics in Table 3 [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 ) ] ; for blood concentration monitoring details in kidney transplant patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
It is important to take Prograf capsules consistently every day either with or without food because the presence and composition of food decreases the bioavailability of Prograf [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Patients should not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice in combination with Prograf [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Prograf should not be used simultaneously with cyclosporine .
Prograf or cyclosporine should be discontinued at least 24 hours before initiating the other .
In the presence of elevated Prograf or cyclosporine concentrations , dosing with the other drug usually should be further delayed .
In patients unable to take oral Prograf capsules , therapy may be initiated with Prograf injection as a continuous IV infusion .
If IV therapy is necessary , conversion from IV to oral Prograf is recommended as soon as oral therapy can be tolerated .
This usually occurs within 2 - 3 days .
In patients receiving an IV infusion , the first dose of oral therapy should be given 8 - 12 hours after discontinuing the IV infusion .
2 . 6 Therapeutic Drug Monitoring Monitoring of tacrolimus blood concentrations in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical parameters is considered an essential aid to patient management for the evaluation of rejection , toxicity , dose adjustments and compliance .
Observed whole blood trough concentrations can be found in Table 1 .
Factors influencing frequency of monitoring include but are not limited to hepatic or renal dysfunction , the addition or discontinuation of potentially interacting drugs and the post - transplant time .
Blood concentration monitoring is not a replacement for renal and liver function monitoring and tissue biopsies .
Data from clinical trials show that tacrolimus whole blood concentrations were most variable during the first week post - transplantation .
The relative risks of toxicity and efficacy failure are related to tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations .
Therefore , monitoring of whole blood trough concentrations is recommended to assist in the clinical evaluation of toxicity and efficacy failure .
Methods commonly used for the assay of tacrolimus include high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection ( HPLC / MS / MS ) and immunoassays .
Immunoassays may react with metabolites as well as parent compound .
Therefore assay results obtained with immunoassays may have a positive bias relative to results of HPLC / MS .
The bias may depend upon the specific assay and laboratory .
Comparison of the concentrations in published literature to patient concentrations using the current assays must be made with detailed knowledge of the assay methods and biological matrices employed .
Whole blood is the matrix of choice and specimens should be collected into tubes containing ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) anti - coagulant .
Heparin anti - coagulation is not recommended because of the tendency to form clots on storage .
Samples which are not analyzed immediately should be stored at room temperature or in a refrigerator and assayed within 7 days ; see assay instructions for specifics .
If samples are to be kept longer they should be deep frozen at - 20 ° C .
One study showed drug recovery > 90 % for samples stored at - 20 ° C for 6 months , with reduced recovery observed after 6 months .
2 . 7 Preparation for Intravenous Product Prograf injection must be diluted with 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection or 5 % Dextrose Injection to a concentration between 0 . 004 mg / mL and 0 . 02 mg / mL prior to use .
Diluted infusion solution should be stored in glass or polyethylene containers and should be discarded after 24 hours .
The diluted infusion solution should not be stored in a PVC container due to decreased stability and the potential for extraction of phthalates .
In situations where more dilute solutions are utilized ( e . g . , pediatric dosing , etc . ) , PVC - free tubing should likewise be used to minimize the potential for significant drug adsorption onto the tubing .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
Due to the chemical instability of tacrolimus in alkaline media , Prograf injection should not be mixed or co - infused with solutions of pH 9 or greater ( e . g . , ganciclovir or acyclovir ) .

Prograf injection is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to HCO - 60 ( polyoxyl 60 hydrogenated castor oil ) .
Hypersensitivity symptoms reported include dyspnea , rash , pruritus , and acute respiratory distress syndrome [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
• • Hypersensitivity to tacrolimus or HCO - 60 ( polyoxyl 60 hydrogenated castor oil ) ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Lymphoma and Other Malignancies : Risk of lymphomas , including post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PLTD ) ; appears related to intensity and duration of use .
Avoid prolonged exposure to UV light and sunlight ( 5 . 2 ) • • Serious infections : Increased risk of bacterial , viral , fungal and protozoal infections , including opportunistic infections : combination immunosuppression should be used with caution ( 5 . 3 ) • • Polyoma Virus Infections : Serious , sometimes fatal outcomes , including polyoma virus - associated nephropathy ( PVAN ) , mostly due to BK virus , and JC virus - associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) ; consider reducing immunosuppression ( 5 . 4 ) • • Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) Infections : Increased risk of CMV viremia and disease ; consider reducing immunosuppression ( 5 . 5 ) • • New Onset Diabetes After Transplant : Monitor blood glucose ( 5 . 6 ) • • Nephrotoxicity : Acute and / or chronic ; reduce the dose ; use caution with other nephrotoxic drugs ( 5 . 7 ) • • Neurotoxicity : Risk of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome , monitor for neurologic abnormalities ; reduce or discontinue Prograf and other immunosuppressants ( 5 . 8 ) • • Hyperkalemia : Monitor serum potassium levels .
Careful consideration should be given prior to use of other agents also associated with hyperkalemia ( 5 . 9 ) • • Hypertension : May require antihypertensive therapy .
Monitor relevant drug - drug interactions ( 5 . 10 ) • • Anaphylactic Reactions with IV formulation : Observe patients receiving Prograf injection for signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis ( 5 . 11 ) • • Use with Sirolimus : Not recommended in liver and heart transplant due to increased risk of serious adverse reactions ( 5 . 12 ) • • Myocardial Hypertrophy : Consider dosage reduction or discontinuation ( 5 . 15 ) • • Immunizations : Use of live vaccines should be avoided ( 5 . 16 ) • • Pure Red Cell Aplasia : Discontinuation should be considered ( 5 . 17 ) 5 . 1 Management of Immunosuppression Only physicians experienced in immunosuppressive therapy and management of organ transplant patients should use Prograf .
Patients receiving the drug should be managed in facilities equipped and staffed with adequate laboratory and supportive medical resources .
The physicians responsible for maintenance therapy should have complete information requisite for the follow up of the patient [ see Boxed Warning ] .
5 . 2 Lymphoma and Other Malignancies Patients receiving immunosuppressants , including Prograf , are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies , particularly of the skin [ see Boxed Warning ] .
The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent .
As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer , exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor .
Post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder ( PTLD ) has been reported in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients .
The majority of PTLD events appear related to Epstein Barr Virus ( EBV ) infection .
The risk of PTLD appears greatest in those individuals who are EBV seronegative , a population which includes many young children .
5 . 3 Serious Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants , including Prograf , are at increased risk of developing bacterial , viral , fungal , and protozoal infections , including opportunistic infections [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 , 5 . 5 ) ] .
These infections may lead to serious , including fatal , outcomes .
Because of the danger of oversuppression of the immune system which can increase susceptibility to infection , combination immunosuppressant therapy should be used with caution .
5 . 4 Polyoma Virus Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants , including Prograf , are at increased risk for opportunistic infections , including polyoma virus infections .
Polyoma virus infections in transplant patients may have serious , and sometimes fatal , outcomes .
These include polyoma virus - associated nephropathy ( PVAN ) , mostly due to BK virus infection , and JC virus - associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) which have been observed in patients receiving tacrolimus [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
PVAN is associated with serious outcomes , including deteriorating renal function and kidney graft loss [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for PVAN .
Cases of PML have been reported in patients treated with Prograf .
PML , which is sometimes fatal , commonly presents with hemiparesis , apathy , confusion , cognitive deficiencies and ataxia .
Risk factors for PML include treatment with immunosuppressant therapies and impairment of immune function .
In immunosuppressed patients , physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients reporting neurological symptoms and consultation with a neurologist should be considered as clinically indicated .
Reductions in immunosuppression should be considered for patients who develop evidence of PVAN or PML .
Physicians should also consider the risk that reduced immunosuppression represents to the functioning allograft .
5 . 5 Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) Infections Patients receiving immunosuppressants , including Prograf , are at increased risk of developing CMV viremia and CMV disease .
The risk of CMV disease is highest among transplant recipients seronegative for CMV at time of transplant who receive a graft from a CMV seropositive donor .
Therapeutic approaches to limiting CMV disease exist and should be routinely provided .
Patient monitoring may help detect patients at risk for CMV disease .
Consideration should be given to reducing the amount of immunosuppression in patients who develop CMV viremia and / or CMV disease .
5 . 6 New Onset Diabetes After Transplant Prograf was shown to cause new onset diabetes mellitus in clinical trials of kidney , liver , and heart transplantation .
New onset diabetes after transplantation may be reversible in some patients .
Black and Hispanic kidney transplant patients are at an increased risk .
Blood glucose concentrations should be monitored closely in patients using Prograf [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 7 Nephrotoxicity Prograf , like other calcineurin - inhibitors , can cause acute or chronic nephrotoxicity , particularly when used in high doses .
Acute nephrotoxicity is most often related to vasoconstriction of the afferent renal arteriole , is characterized by increasing serum creatinine , hyperkalemia , and / or a decrease in urine output , and is typically reversible .
Chronic calcineurin - inhibitor nephrotoxicity is associated with increased serum creatinine , decreased kidney graft life , and characteristic histologic changes observed on renal biopsy ; the changes associated with chronic calcineurin - inhibitor nephrotoxicity are typically progressive .
Patients with impaired renal function should be monitored closely as the dosage of Prograf may need to be reduced .
In patients with persistent elevations of serum creatinine who are unresponsive to dosage adjustments , consideration should be given to changing to another immunosuppressive therapy .
Based on reported adverse reactions terms related to decreased renal function , nephrotoxicity was reported in approximately 52 % of kidney transplantation patients and in 40 % and 36 % of liver transplantation patients receiving Prograf in the U . S . and European randomized trials , respectively , and in 59 % of heart transplantation patients in a European randomized trial [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Due to the potential for additive or synergistic impairment of renal function , care should be taken when administering Prograf with drugs that may be associated with renal dysfunction .
These include , but are not limited to , aminoglycosides , ganciclovir , amphotericin B , cisplatin , nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( e . g . , tenofovir ) and protease inhibitors ( e . g . , ritonavir , indinavir ) .
Similarly , care should be exercised when administering with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as antifungal drugs ( e . g . , ketoconazole ) , calcium channel blockers ( e . g . , diltiazem , verapamil ) , and macrolide antibiotics ( e . g . , clarithromycin , erythromycin , troleandomycin ) which will result in increased tacrolimus whole blood concentrations due to inhibition of tacrolimus metabolism [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 , 7 . 4 , 7 . 5 , 7 . 6 ) ] .
5 . 8 Neurotoxicity Prograf may cause a spectrum of neurotoxicities , particularly when used in high doses .
The most severe neurotoxicities include posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( PRES ) , delirium , and coma .
Patients treated with tacrolimus have been reported to develop PRES . Symptoms indicating PRES include headache , altered mental status , seizures , visual disturbances and hypertension .
Diagnosis may be confirmed by radiological procedure .
If PRES is suspected or diagnosed , blood pressure control should be maintained and immediate reduction of immunosuppression is advised .
This syndrome is characterized by reversal of symptoms upon reduction or discontinuation of immunosuppression .
Coma and delirium , in the absence of PRES , have also been associated with high plasma concentrations of tacrolimus .
Seizures have occurred in adult and pediatric patients receiving Prograf [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Less severe neurotoxicities , include tremors , paresthesias , headache , and other changes in motor function , mental status , and sensory function [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Tremor and headache have been associated with high whole - blood concentrations of tacrolimus and may respond to dosage adjustment .
5 . 9 Hyperkalemia Hyperkalemia has been reported with Prograf use .
Serum potassium levels should be monitored .
Careful consideration should be given prior to use of other agents also associated with hyperkalemia ( e . g . , potassium - sparing diuretics , ACE inhibitors , angiotensin receptor blockers ) during Prograf therapy [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 10 Hypertension Hypertension is a common adverse effect of Prograf therapy and may require antihypertensive therapy [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The control of blood pressure can be accomplished with any of the common antihypertensive agents , though careful consideration should be given prior to use of antihypertensive agents associated with hyperkalemia ( e . g . , potassium - sparing diuretics , ACE inhibitors , angiotensin receptor blockers ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] .
Calcium - channel blocking agents may increase tacrolimus blood concentrations and therefore require dosage reduction of Prograf [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 5 ) ] .
5 . 11 Anaphylactic Reactions with Prograf Injection Anaphylactic reactions have occurred with injectables containing castor oil derivatives , including Prograf , in a small percentage of patients ( 0 . 6 % ) .
The exact cause of these reactions is not known .
Prograf injection should be reserved for patients who are unable to take Prograf capsules [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 . 4 ) ] .
Patients receiving Prograf injection should be under continuous observation for at least the first 30 minutes following the start of the infusion and at frequent intervals thereafter .
If signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis occur , the infusion should be stopped .
An aqueous solution of epinephrine should be available at the bedside as well as a source of oxygen .
5 . 12 Use with Sirolimus The safety and efficacy of Prograf with sirolimus has not been established in kidney transplant patients .
Use of sirolimus with Prograf in studies of de novo liver transplant patients was associated with an excess mortality , graft loss , and hepatic artery thrombosis ( HAT ) and is not recommended [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 . 4 ) ] .
Use of sirolimus ( 2 mg per day ) with Prograf in heart transplant patients in a U . S . trial was associated with increased risk of renal function impairment , wound healing complications , and insulin - dependent post - transplant diabetes mellitus , and is not recommended [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 13 Use with CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers When coadministering Prograf with strong CYP3A4 - inhibitors ( e . g . , telaprevir , boceprevir , ritonavir , ketoconazole , itraconazole , voriconazole , clarithromycin ) and strong inducers ( e . g . , rifampin , rifabutin ) adjustments in the dosing regimen of Prograf and subsequent frequent monitoring of tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations and tacrolimus - associated adverse reactions are recommended [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
5 . 14 QT Prolongation Prograf may prolong the QT / QTc interval and may cause Torsade de Pointes .
Avoid Prograf in patients with congenital long QT syndrome .
In patients with congestive heart failure , bradyarrhythmias , those taking certain antiarrhythmic medications or other medicinal products that lead to QT prolongation , and those with electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia , hypocalcemia , or hypomagnesemia , consider obtaining electrocardiograms and monitoring electrolytes ( magnesium , potassium , calcium ) periodically during treatment .
When coadministering Prograf with other substrates and / or inhibitors of CYP3A4 that also have the potential to prolong the QT interval , a reduction in Prograf dose , frequent monitoring of tacrolimus whole blood concentrations , and monitoring for QT prolongation is recommended .
Use of Prograf with amiodarone has been reported to result in increased tacrolimus whole blood concentrations with or without concurrent QT prolongation [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
5 . 15 Myocardial Hypertrophy Myocardial hypertrophy has been reported in infants , children , and adults , particularly those with high tacrolimus trough concentrations , and is generally manifested by echocardiographically demonstrated concentric increases in left ventricular posterior wall and interventricular septum thickness .
This condition appears reversible in most cases following dose reduction or discontinuance of therapy .
In patients who develop renal failure or clinical manifestations of ventricular dysfunction while receiving Prograf therapy , echocardiographic evaluation should be considered .
If myocardial hypertrophy is diagnosed , dosage reduction or discontinuation of Prograf should be considered [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 16 Immunizations The use of live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with tacrolimus ; examples include ( not limited to ) the following : intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , BCG , yellow fever , varicella , and TY21a typhoid vaccines .
5 . 17 Pure Red Cell Aplasia Cases of pure red cell aplasia ( PRCA ) have been reported in patients treated with tacrolimus .
A mechanism for tacrolimus - induced PRCA has not been elucidated .
All patients reported risk factors for PRCA such as parvovirus B19 infection , underlying disease , or concomitant medications associated with PRCA .
If PRCA is diagnosed , discontinuation of Prograf should be considered [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 18 Gastrointestinal Perforation Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported in patients treated with Prograf ; all reported cases were considered to be a complication of transplant surgery or accompanied by infection , diverticulum , or malignant neoplasm .

6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In addition , the clinical trials were not designed to establish comparative differences across study arms with regards to the adverse reactions discussed below .
Kidney Transplant The incidence of adverse reactions was determined in three randomized kidney transplant trials .
One of the trials used azathioprine ( AZA ) and corticosteroids and two of the trials used mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) and corticosteroids concomitantly for maintenance immunosuppression .
Prograf - based immunosuppression in conjunction with azathioprine and corticosteroids following kidney transplantation was assessed in trial where 205 patients received Prograf based immunosuppression and 207 patients received cyclosporine based immunosuppression .
The trial population had a mean age of 43 years ( mean ± sd was 43 ± 13 years on Prograf and 44 ± 12 years on cyclosporine arm ) , the distribution was 61 % male , and the composition was White ( 58 % ) , Black ( 25 % ) , Hispanic ( 12 % ) and Other ( 5 % ) .
The 12 month post - transplant information from this trial is presented below .
The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 30 % ) observed in Prograf - treated kidney transplant patients are : infection , tremor , hypertension , abnormal renal function , constipation , diarrhea , headache , abdominal pain , insomnia , nausea , hypomagnesemia , urinary tract infection , hypophosphatemia , peripheral edema , asthenia , pain , hyperlipidemia , hyperkalemia and anemia .
Adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 15 % of kidney transplant patients treated with Prograf in conjunction with azathioprine are presented below : Table 4 .

In the non - US trial ( Study 1 ) , the incidence of adverse reactions was based on 1195 kidney transplant patients that received Prograf ( Group C , n = 403 ) , or one of two cyclosporine ( CsA ) regimens ( Group A , n = 384 and Group B , n = 408 ) in combination with MMF and corticosteroids ; all patients , except those in one of the two cyclosporine groups , also received induction with daclizumab .
The trial population had a mean age of 46 years ( range 17 to 76 ) , the distribution was 65 % male , and the composition was 93 % Caucasian .
The 12 month post - transplant information from this trial is presented below .
Adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 10 % of kidney transplant patients treated with Prograf in conjunction with MMF in Study 1 [ Note : This trial was conducted entirely outside of the United States .
Such trials often report a lower incidence of adverse reactions in comparison to U . S . trials ] are presented below : Table 5 .

Liver Transplantation There were two randomized comparative liver transplant trials .
In the U . S . trial , 263 adult and pediatric patients received tacrolimus and steroids and 266 patients received cyclosporine - based immunosuppressive regimen ( CsA / AZA ) .
The trial population had a mean age of 44 years ( range 0 . 4 to70 ) , the distribution was 52 % male , and the composition was White ( 78 % ) , Black ( 5 % ) , Asian ( 2 % ) , Hispanic ( 13 % ) and Other ( 2 % ) .
In the European trial , 270 patients received tacrolimus and steroids and 275 patients received CsA / AZA .
The trial population had a mean age of 46 years ( range 15 to 68 ) , the distribution was 59 % male , and the composition was White ( 95 . 4 % ) , Black ( 1 % ) , Asian ( 2 % ) and Other ( 2 % ) .
The proportion of patients reporting more than one adverse event was > 99 % in both the tacrolimus group and the CsA / AZA group .
Precautions must be taken when comparing the incidence of adverse reactions in the U . S . trial to that in the European trial .
The 12 - month post - transplant information from the U . S . trial and from the European trial is presented below .
The two trials also included different patient populations and patients were treated with immunosuppressive regimens of differing intensities .
Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 15 % in tacrolimus patients ( combined trial results ) are presented below for the two controlled trials in liver transplantation .
The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 40 % ) observed in Prograf - treated liver transplant patients are : tremor , headache , diarrhea , hypertension , nausea , abnormal renal function , abdominal pain , insomnia , paresthesia , anemia , pain , fever , asthenia , hyperkalemia , hypomagnesemia , and hyperglycemia .
These all occur with oral and IV administration of Prograf and some may respond to a reduction in dosing ( e . g . , tremor , headache , paresthesia , hypertension ) .
Diarrhea was sometimes associated with other gastrointestinal complaints such as nausea and vomiting .

Heart Transplantation The incidence of adverse reactions was determined based on two trials in primary orthotopic heart transplantation .
In a trial conducted in Europe , 314 patients received a regimen of antibody induction , corticosteroids and azathioprine ( AZA ) in combination with Prograf ( n = 157 ) or cyclosporine ( n = 157 ) for 18 months .
The trial population had a mean age of 51 years ( range 18 to 65 ) , the distribution was 82 % male , and the composition was White ( 96 % ) , Black ( 3 % ) and other ( 1 % ) .
The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 15 % ) observed in Prograf - treated heart transplant patients are : abnormal renal function , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , CMV infection , tremor , hyperglycemia , leukopenia , infection , anemia , bronchitis , pericardial effusion , urinary tract infection and hyperlipemia .
Adverse reactions in heart transplant patients in the European trial are presented below : Table 8 .

In a U . S . trial , the incidence of adverse reactions was based on 331 heart transplant patients that received corticosteroids and Prograf in combination with sirolimus ( n = 109 ) , Prograf in combination with MMF ( n = 107 ) or cyclosporine modified in combination with MMF ( n = 115 ) for 1 year .
The trial population had a mean age of 53 years ( range 18 to 75 ) , the distribution was 78 % male , and the composition was White ( 83 % ) , Black ( 13 % ) and other ( 4 % ) .
Only selected targeted treatment - emergent adverse reactions were collected in the U . S . heart transplantation trial .
Those reactions that were reported at a rate of 15 % or greater in patients treated with Prograf and MMF include the following : any target adverse reactions ( 99 % ) , hypertension ( 89 % ) , hyperglycemia requiring antihyperglycemic therapy ( 70 % ) , hypertriglyceridemia ( 65 % ) , anemia ( hemoglobin < 10 . 0 g / dL ) ( 65 % ) , fasting blood glucose > 140 mg / dL ( on two separate occasions ) ( 61 % ) , hypercholesterolemia ( 57 % ) , hyperlipidemia ( 34 % ) , WBCs < 3000 cells / mcL ( 34 % ) , serious bacterial infections ( 30 % ) , magnesium < 1 . 2 mEq / L ( 24 % ) , platelet count < 75 , 000 cells / mcL ( 19 % ) , and other opportunistic infections ( 15 % ) .
Other targeted treatment - emergent adverse reactions in Prograf - treated patients occurred at a rate of less than 15 % , and include the following : Cushingoid features , impaired wound healing , hyperkalemia , Candida infection , and CMV infection / syndrome .
New Onset Diabetes After Transplant Kidney Transplant New Onset Diabetes After Transplant ( NODAT ) is defined as a composite of fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg / dL , HbA1C ≥ 6 % , insulin use ≥ 30 days or oral hypoglycemic use .
In a trial in kidney transplant patients ( Study 2 ) , NODAT was observed in 75 % in the Prograf - treated and 61 % in the Neoral - treated patients without pre - transplant history of diabetes mellitus ( Table 9 ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .

Data are presented in Tables 10 to 13 .
PTDM was reported in 20 % of Prograf / Azathioprine ( AZA ) - treated kidney transplant patients without pre - transplant history of diabetes mellitus in a Phase 3 trial ( Table 10 ) .
The median time to onset of PTDM was 68 days .
Insulin dependence was reversible in 15 % of these PTDM patients at one year and in 50 % at 2 years post - transplant .
Black and Hispanic kidney transplant patients were at an increased risk of development of PTDM ( Table 11 ) .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors : ( 1 ) seriousness of the reaction , ( 2 ) frequency of the reporting , or ( 3 ) strength of causal connection to the drug .
Other reactions include : Cardiovascular Atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter , cardiac arrhythmia , cardiac arrest , electrocardiogram T wave abnormal , flushing , myocardial infarction , myocardial ischaemia , pericardial effusion , QT prolongation , Torsade de Pointes , venous thrombosis deep limb , ventricular extrasystoles , ventricular fibrillation , myocardial hypertrophy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 15 ) ] .
Gastrointestinal Bile duct stenosis , colitis , enterocolitis , gastroenteritis , gastrooesophageal reflux disease , hepatic cytolysis , hepatic necrosis , hepatotoxicity , impaired gastric emptying , liver fatty , mouth ulceration , pancreatitis haemorrhagic , pancreatitis necrotizing , stomach ulcer , venoocclusive liver disease Hemic / Lymphatic Agranulocytosis , disseminated intravascular coagulation , hemolytic anemia , neutropenia , pancytopenia , thrombocytopenic purpura , thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura , pure red cell aplasia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 17 ) ] Infections Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) , sometimes fatal ; - polyoma virus - associated nephropathy , ( PVAN ) including graft loss [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] Metabolic / Nutritional Glycosuria , increased amylase including pancreatitis , weight decreased Miscellaneous Feeling hot and cold , feeling jittery , hot flushes , multi - organ failure , primary graft dysfunction Nervous System Carpal tunnel syndrome , cerebral infarction , hemiparesis , leukoencephalopathy , mental disorder , mutism , posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( PRES ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] , progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] , quadriplegia , speech disorder , syncope Respiratory Acute respiratory distress syndrome , interstitial lung disease , lung infiltration , respiratory distress , respiratory failure Skin Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis Special Senses Blindness , blindness cortical , hearing loss including deafness , photophobia Urogenital Acute renal failure , cystitis haemorrhagic , hemolytic - uremic syndrome , micturition disorder 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Since tacrolimus is metabolized mainly by CYP3A enzymes , drugs or substances known to inhibit these enzymes may increase tacrolimus whole blood concentrations .
Drugs known to induce CYP3A enzymes may decrease tacrolimus whole blood concentrations [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 13 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Dose adjustments may be needed along with frequent monitoring of tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations when Prograf is administered with CYP3A inhibitors or inducers .
In addition , patients should be monitored for adverse reactions including changes in renal function and QT prolongation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) and ( 5 . 14 ) ] .
• • Mycophenolic Acid Products : Can increase MPA exposure after crossover from cyclosporine to Prograf ; monitor for MPA - related adverse reactions and adjust MMF or MPA - dose as needed ( 7 . 1 ) • • Nelfinavir and Grapefruit Juice : Increased tacrolimus concentrations via CYP3A inhibition ; avoid concomitant use ( 7 . 2 , 7 . 3 ) • • CYP3A Inhibitors : Increased tacrolimus concentrations ; monitor concentrations and adjust tacrolimus dose as needed with concomitant use ( 5 . 13 , 7 . 3 , 7 . 4 , 7 . 5 , 7 . 6 ) • • CYP3A4 Inducers : Decreased tacrolimus concentrations ; monitor concentrations and adjust tacrolimus dose as needed with concomitant use ( 5 . 13 , 7 . 7 , 7 . 8 , 7 . 9 ) 7 . 1 Mycophenolic Acid Products With a given dose of mycophenolic acid ( MPA ) products , exposure to MPA is higher with Prograf co - administration than with cyclosporine co - administration because cyclosporine interrupts the enterohepatic recirculation of MPA while tacrolimus does not .
Clinicians should be aware that there is also a potential for increased MPA exposure after crossover from cyclosporine to Prograf in patients concomitantly receiving MPA - containing products .
7 . 2 Grapefruit Juice Grapefruit juice inhibits CYP3A - enzymes resulting in increased tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations , and patients should avoid eating grapefruit or drinking grapefruit juice with tacrolimus [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
7 . 3 Protease Inhibitors Most protease inhibitors inhibit CYP3A enzymes and may increase tacrolimus whole blood concentrations .
It is recommended to avoid concomitant use of tacrolimus with nelfinavir unless the benefits outweigh the risks [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Whole blood concentrations of tacrolimus are markedly increased when co - administered with telaprevir or with boceprevir [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Monitoring of tacrolimus whole blood concentrations and tacrolimus - associated adverse reactions , and appropriate adjustments in the dosing regimen of tacrolimus are recommended when tacrolimus and protease inhibitors ( e . g . , ritonavir , telaprevir , boceprevir ) are used concomitantly .
7 . 4 Antifungal Agents Frequent monitoring of whole blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments of tacrolimus are recommended when concomitant use of the following antifungal drugs with tacrolimus is initiated or discontinued [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Azoles : Voriconazole , posaconazole , itraconazole , ketoconazole , fluconazole and clotrimazole inhibit CYP3A metabolism of tacrolimus and increase tacrolimus whole blood concentrations .
When initiating therapy with voriconazole or posaconazole in patients already receiving tacrolimus , it is recommended that the tacrolimus dose be initially reduced to one - third of the original dose and the subsequent tacrolimus doses be adjusted based on the tacrolimus whole blood concentrations .
Caspofungin is an inducer of CYP3A and decreases whole blood concentrations of tacrolimus .
7 . 5 Calcium Channel Blockers Verapamil , diltiazem , nifedipine , and nicardipine inhibit CYP3A metabolism of tacrolimus and may increase tacrolimus whole blood concentrations .
Monitoring of whole blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments of tacrolimus are recommended when these calcium channel blocking drugs and tacrolimus are used concomitantly .
7 . 6 Antibacterials Erythromycin , clarithromycin , troleandomycin and chloramphenicol inhibit CYP3A metabolism of tacrolimus and may increase tacrolimus whole blood concentrations .
Monitoring of blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments of tacrolimus are recommended when these drugs and tacrolimus are used concomitantly .
7 . 7 Antimycobacterials Rifampin [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] and rifabutin are inducers of CYP3A enzymes and may decrease tacrolimus whole blood concentrations .
Monitoring of whole blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments of tacrolimus are recommended when these antimycobacterial drugs and tacrolimus are used concomitantly .
7 . 8 Anticonvulsants Phenytoin , carbamazepine and phenobarbital induce CYP3A enzymes and may decrease tacrolimus whole blood concentrations .
Monitoring of whole blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments of tacrolimus are recommended when these drugs and tacrolimus are used concomitantly .
Concomitant administration of phenytoin with tacrolimus may also increase phenytoin plasma concentrations .
Thus , frequent monitoring phenytoin plasma concentrations and adjusting the phenytoin dose as needed are recommended when tacrolimus and phenytoin are administered concomitantly .
7 . 9 St . John ’ s Wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) St . John ’ s Wort induces CYP3A enzymes and may decrease tacrolimus whole blood concentrations .
Monitoring of whole blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments of tacrolimus are recommended when St . John ’ s Wort and tacrolimus are co - administered .
7 . 10 Gastric Acid Suppressors / Neutralizers Lansoprazole and omeprazole , as CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 substrates , may potentially inhibit the CYP3A4 metabolism of tacrolimus and thereby substantially increase tacrolimus whole blood concentrations , especially in transplant patients who are intermediate or poor CYP2C19 metabolizers , as compared to those patients who are efficient CYP2C19 metabolizers .
Cimetidine may also inhibit the CYP3A4 metabolism of tacrolimus and thereby substantially increase tacrolimus whole blood concentrations .
Coadministration with magnesium and aluminum hydroxide antacids increase tacrolimus whole blood concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Monitoring of whole blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments of tacrolimus are recommended when these drugs and tacrolimus are used concomitantly .
7 . 11 Others Bromocriptine , nefazodone , metoclopramide , danazol , ethinyl estradiol , amiodarone and methylprednisolone may inhibit CYP3A metabolism of tacrolimus and increase tacrolimus whole blood concentrations .
Monitoring of blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments of tacrolimus are recommended when these drugs and tacrolimus are co - administered .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Pregnancy : Based on animal data may cause fetal harm .
Use only if the potential benefit justifies the risk ( 8 . 1 ) • • Nursing Mothers : Discontinue nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother ( 8 . 3 ) • • Hepatic / Renal impaired patients : Administer at the lower end of the recommended starting dose .
Monitor renal function in patients with impaired renal function ( 2 . 3 , 2 . 4 , 8 . 6 , 8 . 7 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C - There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Tacrolimus is transferred across the placenta .
The use of tacrolimus during pregnancy in humans has been associated with neonatal hyperkalemia and renal dysfunction .
Tacrolimus given orally to pregnant rabbits at 0 . 5 to 4 . 3 times the clinical dose and pregnant rats at 0 . 8 to 6 . 9 times the clinical dose was associated with an increased incidence of fetal death in utero , fetal malformations ( cardiovascular , skeletal , omphalocele , and gallbladder agenesis ) and maternal toxicity .
Prograf should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
In pregnant rabbits , tacrolimus at oral doses of 0 . 32 and 1 . 0 mg / kg , 0 . 5 to 4 . 3 times the clinical dose range ( 0 . 075 – 0 . 2 mg / kg ) based on body surface area , was associated with maternal toxicity as well as an increased incidence of abortions .
At the 1 mg / kg dose , fetal rabbits showed an increased incidence of malformations ( ventricular hypoplasia , interventricular septal defect , bulbous aortic arch , stenosis of ductus arteriosus , interrupted ossification of vertebral arch , vertebral and rib malformations , omphalocele , and gallbladder agenesis ) and developmental variations .
In pregnant rats , tacrolimus at oral doses of 3 . 2 mg / kg , 2 . 6 to 6 . 9 times the clinical dose range was associated with maternal toxicity , an increase in late resorptions , decreased numbers of live births , and decreased pup weight and viability .
Tacrolimus , given orally to pregnant rats after organogenesis and during lactation at 1 . 0 and 3 . 2 mg / kg , 0 . 8 to 6 . 9 times the recommended clinical dose range was associated with reduced pup weights and pup viability ( 3 . 2 mg / kg only ) ; among the high dose pups that died early , an increased incidence of kidney hydronephrosis was observed .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Tacrolimus is excreted in human milk .
As the effect of chronic exposure to tacrolimus in healthy infants is not established , patients maintained on Prograf should discontinue nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Prograf in pediatric kidney and heart transplant patients have not been established .
Successful liver transplants have been performed in pediatric patients ( ages up to 16 years ) using Prograf .
Two randomized active - controlled trials of Prograf in primary liver transplantation included 56 pediatric patients .
Thirty - one patients were randomized to Prograf - based and 25 to cyclosporine - based therapies .
Additionally , a minimum of 122 pediatric patients were studied in an uncontrolled trial of tacrolimus in living related donor liver transplantation .
Pediatric patients generally required higher doses of Prograf to maintain blood trough concentrations of tacrolimus similar to adult patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of Prograf did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Use in Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of Prograf in patients with renal impairment was similar to that in healthy volunteers with normal renal function .
However , consideration should be given to dosing Prograf at the lower end of the therapeutic dosing range in patients who have received a liver or heart transplant and have pre - existing renal impairment .
Further reductions in dose below the targeted range may be required [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Use in Hepatic Impairment The mean clearance of tacrolimus was substantially lower in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( mean Child - Pugh score : > 10 ) compared to healthy volunteers with normal hepatic function .
Close monitoring of tacrolimus trough concentrations is warranted in patients with hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The use of Prograf in liver transplant recipients experiencing post - transplant hepatic impairment may be associated with increased risk of developing renal insufficiency related to high whole - blood trough concentrations of tacrolimus .
These patients should be monitored closely and dosage adjustments should be considered .
Some evidence suggests that lower doses should be used in these patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Limited overdosage experience is available .
Acute overdosages of up to 30 times the intended dose have been reported .
Almost all cases have been asymptomatic and all patients recovered with no sequelae .
Acute overdosage was sometimes followed by adverse reactions consistent with those listed in Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ( including tremors , abnormal renal function , hypertension , and peripheral edema ) ; in one case of acute overdosage , transient urticaria and lethargy were observed .
Based on the poor aqueous solubility and extensive erythrocyte and plasma protein binding , it is anticipated that tacrolimus is not dialyzable to any significant extent ; there is no experience with charcoal hemoperfusion .
The oral use of activated charcoal has been reported in treating acute overdoses , but experience has not been sufficient to warrant recommending its use .
General supportive measures and treatment of specific symptoms should be followed in all cases of overdosage .
In acute oral and IV toxicity studies , mortalities were seen at or above the following doses : in adult rats , 52 times the recommended human oral dose ; in immature rats , 16 times the recommended oral dose ; and in adult rats , 16 times the recommended human IV dose ( all based on body surface area corrections ) .

Tacrolimus , previously known as FK506 , is the active ingredient in Prograf .
Tacrolimus is a macrolide immunosuppressant produced by Streptomyces tsukubaensis .
Chemically , tacrolimus is designated as [ 3 S - [ 3 R * [ E ( 1 S * , 3 S * , 4 S * ) ] , 4 S * , 5 R * , 8 S * , 9 E , 12 R * , 14 R * , 15 S * , 16 R * , 18 S * , 19 S * , 26 aR * ] ] - 5 , 6 , 8 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 26 a - hexadecahydro - 5 , 19 - dihydroxy - 3 - [ 2 - ( 4 - hydroxy - 3 - methoxycyclohexyl ) - 1 - methylethenyl ] - 14 , 16 - dimethoxy - 4 , 10 , 12 , 18 - tetramethyl - 8 - ( 2 - propenyl ) - 15 , 19 - epoxy - 3 H - pyrido [ 2 , 1 - c ] [ 1 , 4 ] oxaazacyclotricosine - 1 , 7 , 20 , 21 ( 4 H , 23 H ) - tetrone , monohydrate .
The chemical structure of tacrolimus is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Tacrolimus has an empirical formula of C44H69NO12 • H2O and a formula weight of 822 . 03 .
Tacrolimus appears as white crystals or crystalline powder .
It is practically insoluble in water , freely soluble in ethanol , and very soluble in methanol and chloroform .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Tacrolimus inhibits T - lymphocyte activation , although the exact mechanism of action is not known .
Experimental evidence suggests that tacrolimus binds to an intracellular protein , FKBP - 12 .
A complex of tacrolimus - FKBP - 12 , calcium , calmodulin , and calcineurin is then formed and the phosphatase activity of calcineurin inhibited .
This effect may prevent the dephosphorylation and translocation of nuclear factor of activated T - cells ( NF - AT ) , a nuclear component thought to initiate gene transcription for the formation of lymphokines ( such as interleukin - 2 , gamma interferon ) .
The net result is the inhibition of T - lymphocyte activation ( i . e . , immunosuppression ) .
Tacrolimus prolongs the survival of the host and transplanted graft in animal transplant models of liver , kidney , heart , bone marrow , small bowel and pancreas , lung and trachea , skin , cornea , and limb .
In animals , tacrolimus has been demonstrated to suppress some humoral immunity and , to a greater extent , cell - mediated reactions such as allograft rejection , delayed type hypersensitivity , collagen - induced arthritis , experimental allergic encephalomyelitis , and graft versus host disease .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Tacrolimus activity is primarily due to the parent drug .
The pharmacokinetic parameters ( mean ± S . D . ) of tacrolimus have been determined following intravenous ( IV ) and / or oral ( PO ) administration in healthy volunteers , and in kidney transplant , liver transplant , and heart transplant patients ( Table 14 ) .

Pharmacokinetic data indicate that whole blood concentrations rather than plasma concentrations serve as the more appropriate sampling compartment to describe tacrolimus pharmacokinetics .
Absorption Absorption of tacrolimus from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration is incomplete and variable .
The absolute bioavailability of tacrolimus was 17 ± 10 % in adult kidney transplant patients ( N = 26 ) , 22 ± 6 % in adult liver transplant patients ( N = 17 ) , 23 ± 9 % in adult heart transplant patients ( N = 11 ) and 18 ± 5 % in healthy volunteers ( N = 16 ) .
A single dose trial conducted in 32 healthy volunteers established the bioequivalence of the 1 mg and 5 mg capsules .
Another single dose trial in 32 healthy volunteers established the bioequivalence of the 0 . 5 mg and 1 mg capsules .
Tacrolimus maximum blood concentrations ( Cmax ) and area under the curve ( AUC ) appeared to increase in a dose - proportional fashion in 18 fasted healthy volunteers receiving a single oral dose of 3 , 7 , and 10 mg .
In 18 kidney transplant patients , tacrolimus trough concentrations from 3 to 30 ng / mL measured at 10 - 12 hours post - dose ( Cmin ) correlated well with the AUC ( correlation coefficient 0 . 93 ) .
In 24 liver transplant patients over a concentration range of 10 to 60 ng / mL , the correlation coefficient was 0 . 94 .
In 25 heart transplant patients over a concentration range of 2 to 24 ng / mL , the correlation coefficient was 0 . 89 after an oral dose of 0 . 075 or 0 . 15 mg / kg / day at steady - state .
Food Effects The rate and extent of tacrolimus absorption were greatest under fasted conditions .
The presence and composition of food decreased both the rate and extent of tacrolimus absorption when administered to 15 healthy volunteers .
The effect was most pronounced with a high - fat meal ( 848 kcal , 46 % fat ) : mean AUC and Cmax were decreased 37 % and 77 % , respectively ; Tmax was lengthened 5 - fold .
A high - carbohydrate meal ( 668 kcal , 85 % carbohydrate ) decreased mean AUC and mean Cmax by 28 % and 65 % , respectively .
In healthy volunteers ( N = 16 ) , the time of the meal also affected tacrolimus bioavailability .
When given immediately following the meal , mean Cmax was reduced 71 % , and mean AUC was reduced 39 % , relative to the fasted condition .
When administered 1 . 5 hours following the meal , mean Cmax was reduced 63 % , and mean AUC was reduced 39 % , relative to the fasted condition .
In 11 liver transplant patients , Prograf administered 15 minutes after a high fat ( 400 kcal , 34 % fat ) breakfast , resulted in decreased AUC ( 27 ± 18 % ) and Cmax ( 50 ± 19 % ) , as compared to a fasted state .
Prograf capsules should be taken consistently every day either with or without food because the presence and composition of food decreases the bioavailability of Prograf [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Distribution The plasma protein binding of tacrolimus is approximately 99 % and is independent of concentration over a range of 5 - 50 ng / mL .
Tacrolimus is bound mainly to albumin and alpha - 1 - acid glycoprotein , and has a high level of association with erythrocytes .
The distribution of tacrolimus between whole blood and plasma depends on several factors , such as hematocrit , temperature at the time of plasma separation , drug concentration , and plasma protein concentration .
In a U . S . trial , the ratio of whole blood concentration to plasma concentration averaged 35 ( range 12 to 67 ) .
Metabolism Tacrolimus is extensively metabolized by the mixed - function oxidase system , primarily the cytochrome P - 450 system ( CYP3A ) .
A metabolic pathway leading to the formation of 8 possible metabolites has been proposed .
Demethylation and hydroxylation were identified as the primary mechanisms of biotransformation in vitro .
The major metabolite identified in incubations with human liver microsomes is 13 - demethyl tacrolimus .
In in vitro studies , a 31 - demethyl metabolite has been reported to have the same activity as tacrolimus .
Excretion The mean clearance following IV administration of tacrolimus is 0 . 040 , 0 . 083 , and 0 . 053 , and 0 . 051 L / hr / kg in healthy volunteers , adult kidney transplant patients , adult liver transplant patients , and adult heart transplant patients , respectively .
In man , less than 1 % of the dose administered is excreted unchanged in urine .
In a mass balance study of IV administered radiolabeled tacrolimus to 6 healthy volunteers , the mean recovery of radiolabel was 77 . 8 ± 12 . 7 % .
Fecal elimination accounted for 92 . 4 ± 1 . 0 % and the elimination half - life based on radioactivity was 48 . 1 ± 15 . 9 hours whereas it was 43 . 5 ± 11 . 6 hours based on tacrolimus concentrations .
The mean clearance of radiolabel was 0 . 029 ± 0 . 015 L / hr / kg and clearance of tacrolimus was 0 . 029 ± 0 . 009 L / hr / kg .
When administered PO , the mean recovery of the radiolabel was 94 . 9 ± 30 . 7 % .
Fecal elimination accounted for 92 . 6 ± 30 . 7 % , urinary elimination accounted for 2 . 3 ± 1 . 1 % and the elimination half - life based on radioactivity was 31 . 9 ± 10 . 5 hours whereas it was 48 . 4 ± 12 . 3 hours based on tacrolimus concentrations .
The mean clearance of radiolabel was 0 . 226 ± 0 . 116 L / hr / kg and clearance of tacrolimus 0 . 172 ± 0 . 088 L / hr / kg .
Specific Populations Pediatric Pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus have been studied in liver transplantation patients , 0 . 7 to 13 . 2 years of age .
Following IV administration of a 0 . 037 mg / kg / day dose to 12 pediatric patients , mean terminal half - life , volume of distribution and clearance were 11 . 5 ± 3 . 8 hours , 2 . 6 ± 2 . 1 L / kg and 0 . 138 ± 0 . 071 L / hr / kg , respectively .
Following oral administration to 9 patients , mean AUC and Cmax were 337 ± 167 ng · hr / mL and 48 . 4 ± 27 . 9 ng / mL , respectively .
The absolute bioavailability was 31 ± 24 % .
Whole blood trough concentrations from 31 patients less than 12 years old showed that pediatric patients needed higher doses than adults to achieve similar tacrolimus trough concentrations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus have also been studied in kidney transplantation patients , 8 . 2 ± 2 . 4 years of age .
Following IV infusion of a 0 . 06 ( range 0 . 06 – 0 . 09 ) mg / kg / day to 12 pediatric patients ( 8 male and 4 female ) , mean terminal half - life and clearance were 10 . 2 ± 5 . 0 ( range 3 . 4 - 25 ) hours and 0 . 12 ± 0 . 04 ( range 0 . 06 - 0 . 17 ) L / hr / kg , respectively .
Following oral administration to the same patients , mean AUC and Cmax were 181 ± 65 ( range 81 - 300 ) ng · hr / mL and 30 ± 11 ( range 14 - 49 ) ng / mL , respectively .
The absolute bioavailability was 19 ± 14 ( range 5 . 2 - 56 ) % .

The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained were similar for both groups .
The mean clearance of tacrolimus in patients with renal dysfunction was similar to that in normal volunteers ( Table 15 ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Hepatic Impairment : Tacrolimus pharmacokinetics have been determined in six patients with mild hepatic dysfunction ( mean Pugh score : 6 . 2 ) following single IV and oral administrations .
The mean clearance of tacrolimus in patients with mild hepatic dysfunction was not substantially different from that in normal volunteers ( see previous table ) .
Tacrolimus pharmacokinetics were studied in 6 patients with severe hepatic dysfunction ( mean Pugh score : > 10 ) .
The mean clearance was substantially lower in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction , irrespective of the route of administration [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Race The pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus have been studied following single IV and oral administration of Prograf to 10 African - American , 12 Latino - American , and 12 Caucasian healthy volunteers .
There were no significant pharmacokinetic differences among the three ethnic groups following a 4 - hour IV infusion of 0 . 015 mg / kg .
However , after single oral administration of 5 mg , mean ( ± SD ) tacrolimus Cmax in African - Americans ( 23 . 6 ± 12 . 1 ng / mL ) was significantly lower than in Caucasians ( 40 . 2 ± 12 . 6 ng / mL ) and the Latino - Americans ( 36 . 2 ± 15 . 8 ng / mL ) ( p < 0 . 01 ) .
Mean AUC0 - inf tended to be lower in African - Americans ( 203 ± 115 ng · hr / mL ) than Caucasians ( 344 ± 186 ng · hr / mL ) and Latino - Americans ( 274 ± 150 ng · hr / mL ) .
The mean ( ± SD ) absolute oral bioavailability ( F ) in African - Americans ( 12 ± 4 . 5 % ) and Latino - Americans ( 14 ± 7 . 4 % ) was significantly lower than in Caucasians ( 19 ± 5 . 8 % , p = 0 . 011 ) .
There was no significant difference in mean terminal T1 / 2 among the three ethnic groups ( range from approximately 25 to 30 hours ) .
A retrospective comparison of African - American and Caucasian kidney transplant patients indicated that African - American patients required higher tacrolimus doses to attain similar trough concentrations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Gender A formal trial to evaluate the effect of gender on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics has not been conducted , however , there was no difference in dosing by gender in the kidney transplant trial .
A retrospective comparison of pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers , and in kidney , liver and heart transplant patients indicated no gender - based differences .
Drug Interactions Frequent monitoring of whole blood concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustments of tacrolimus are recommended when concomitant use of the following drugs with tacrolimus is initiated or discontinued [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Telaprevir : In a single dose study in 9 healthy volunteers , coadministration of tacrolimus ( 0 . 5 mg single dose ) with telaprevir ( 750 mg three times daily for 13 days ) increased the tacrolimus dose - normalized Cmax by 9 . 3 - fold and AUC by 70 - fold compared to tacrolimus alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
Boceprevir : In a single dose study in 12 subjects , coadministration of tacrolimus ( 0 . 5 mg single dose ) with boceprevir ( 800 mg three times daily for 11 days ) increased tacrolimus Cmax by 9 . 9 - fold and AUC by 17 - fold compared to tacrolimus alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
Nelfinavir : Based on a clinical study of 5 liver transplant recipients , co - administration of tacrolimus with nelfinavir increased blood concentrations of tacrolimus significantly and , as a result , a reduction in the tacrolimus dose by an average of 16 - fold was needed to maintain mean trough tacrolimus blood concentrations of 9 . 7 ng / mL .
It is recommended to avoid concomitant use of Prograf and nelfinavir unless the benefits outweigh the risks [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
Rifampin : In a study of 6 normal volunteers , a significant decrease in tacrolimus oral bioavailability ( 14 ± 6 % vs . 7 ± 3 % ) was observed with concomitant rifampin administration ( 600 mg ) .
In addition , there was a significant increase in tacrolimus clearance ( 0 . 036 ± 0 . 008 L / hr / kg vs . 0 . 053 ± 0 . 010 L / hr / kg ) with concomitant rifampin administration [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 7 ) ] .
Magnesium - aluminum - hydroxide : In a single - dose crossover study in healthy volunteers , co - administration of tacrolimus and magnesium - aluminum - hydroxide resulted in a 21 % increase in the mean tacrolimus AUC and a 10 % decrease in the mean tacrolimus Cmax relative to tacrolimus administration alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 10 ) ] .
Ketoconazole : In a study of 6 normal volunteers , a significant increase in tacrolimus oral bioavailability ( 14 ± 5 % vs . 30 ± 8 % ) was observed with concomitant ketoconazole administration ( 200 mg ) .
The apparent oral clearance of tacrolimus during ketoconazole administration was significantly decreased compared to tacrolimus alone ( 0 . 430 ± 0 . 129 L / hr / kg vs . 0 . 148 ± 0 . 043 L / hr / kg ) .
Overall , IV clearance of tacrolimus was not significantly changed by ketoconazole co - administration , although it was highly variable between patients [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) ] .
Voriconazole ( see complete prescribing information for VFEND ® ) : Repeat oral dose administration of voriconazole ( 400 mg every 12 hours for one day , then 200 mg every 12 hours for 6 days ) increased tacrolimus ( 0 . 1 mg / kg single dose ) Cmax and AUCτ in healthy subjects by an average of 2 - fold ( 90 % CI : 1 . 9 , 2 . 5 ) and 3 - fold ( 90 % CI : 2 . 7 , 3 . 8 ) , respectively [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) ] .
Posaconazole ( see complete prescribing information for Noxafil ® ) : Repeat oral administration of posaconazole ( 400 mg twice daily for 7 days ) increased tacrolimus ( 0 . 05 mg / kg single dose ) Cmax and AUC in healthy subjects by an average of 2 - fold ( 90 % CI : 2 . 01 , 2 . 42 ) and 4 . 5 - fold ( 90 % CI 4 . 03 , 5 . 19 ) , respectively [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) ] .
Caspofungin ( see complete prescribing information for CANCIDAS ® ) : Caspofungin reduced the blood AUC0 - 12 of tacrolimus by approximately 20 % , peak blood concentration ( Cmax ) by 16 % , and 12 - hour blood concentration ( C12hr ) by 26 % in healthy adult subjects when tacrolimus ( 2 doses of 0 . 1 mg / kg 12 hours apart ) was administered on the 10 th day of CANCIDAS ® 70 mg daily , as compared to results from a control period in which tacrolimus was administered alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies were conducted in male and female rats and mice .
In the 80 - week mouse oral study and in the 104 - week rat oral study , no relationship of tumor incidence to tacrolimus dosage was found .
The highest dose used in the mouse was 3 . 0 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 9 to 2 . 2 times the AUC at clinical doses of 0 . 075 to 0 . 2 mg / kg / day ) and in the rat was 5 . 0 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 265 to 0 . 65 times the AUC at clinical doses of 0 . 075 to 0 . 2 mg / kg / day ) [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
A 104 - week dermal carcinogenicity study was performed in mice with tacrolimus ointment ( 0 . 03 % - 3 % ) , equivalent to tacrolimus doses of 1 . 1 - 118 mg / kg / day or 3 . 3 - 354 mg / m2 / day .
In the study , the incidence of skin tumors was minimal and the topical application of tacrolimus was not associated with skin tumor formation under ambient room lighting .
However , a statistically significant elevation in the incidence of pleomorphic lymphoma in high dose male ( 25 / 50 ) and female animals ( 27 / 50 ) and in the incidence of undifferentiated lymphoma in high dose female animals ( 13 / 50 ) was noted in the mouse dermal carcinogenicity study .
Lymphomas were noted in the mouse dermal carcinogenicity study at a daily dose of 3 . 5 mg / kg ( 0 . 1 % tacrolimus ointment ) .
No drug - related tumors were noted in the mouse dermal carcinogenicity study at a daily dose of 1 . 1 mg / kg ( 0 . 03 % tacrolimus ointment ) .
The relevance of topical administration of tacrolimus in the setting of systemic tacrolimus use is unknown .
The implications of these carcinogenicity studies to the human condition are limited ; doses of tacrolimus were administered that likely induced immunosuppression in these animals impairing their immune system ’ s ability to inhibit unrelated carcinogenesis .
No evidence of genotoxicity was seen in bacterial ( Salmonella and E . coli ) or mammalian ( Chinese hamster lung - derived cells ) in vitro assays of mutagenicity , the in vitro CHO / HGPRT assay of mutagenicity , or in vivo clastogenicity assays performed in mice ; tacrolimus did not cause unscheduled DNA synthesis in rodent hepatocytes .
Tacrolimus given orally at 1 . 0 mg / kg ( 0 . 8 to 2 . 2 times the clinical dose range of 0 . 075 to 0 . 2 mg / kg / day based on body surface area ) to male and female rats , prior to and during mating , as well as to dams during gestation and lactation , was associated with embryolethality and adverse effects on female reproduction .
Effects on female reproductive function ( parturition ) and embryolethal effects were indicated by a higher rate of pre - implantation loss and increased numbers of undelivered and nonviable pups .
When given at 3 . 2 mg / kg ( 2 . 6 to 6 . 9 times the clinical dose range based on body surface area ) , tacrolimus was associated with maternal and paternal toxicity as well as reproductive toxicity including marked adverse effects on estrus cycles , parturition , pup viability , and pup malformations .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Kidney Transplantation Prograf / azathioprine ( AZA ) Prograf - based immunosuppression in conjunction with azathioprine and corticosteroids following kidney transplantation was assessed in a randomized , multicenter , non - blinded , prospective trial .
There were 412 kidney transplant patients enrolled at 19 clinical sites in the United States .
Study therapy was initiated when renal function was stable as indicated by a serum creatinine ≤ 4 mg / dL ( median of 4 days after transplantation , range 1 to 14 days ) .
Patients less than 6 years of age were excluded .
There were 205 patients randomized to Prograf - based immunosuppression and 207 patients were randomized to cyclosporine - based immunosuppression .
All patients received prophylactic induction therapy consisting of an antilymphocyte antibody preparation , corticosteroids and azathioprine .
Overall 1 year patient and graft survival was 96 . 1 % and 89 . 6 % , respectively .
Data from this trial of Prograf in conjunction with azathioprine indicate that during the first three months of that trial , 80 % of the patients maintained trough concentrations between 7 - 20 ng / mL , and then between 5 - 15 ng / mL , through 1 year .
Prograf / mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) Prograf - based immunosuppression in conjunction with MMF , corticosteroids , and induction has been studied .
In a randomized , open - label , multi - center trial ( Study 1 ) , 1589 kidney transplant patients received Prograf ( Group C , n = 401 ) , sirolimus ( Group D , n = 399 ) , or one of two cyclosporine ( CsA ) regimens ( Group A , n = 390 and Group B , n = 399 ) in combination with MMF and corticosteroids ; all patients , except those in one of the two cyclosporine groups , also received induction with daclizumab .
The trial was conducted outside the United States ; the trial population was 93 % Caucasian .
In this trial , mortality at 12 months in patients receiving Prograf / MMF was similar ( 3 % ) compared to patients receiving cyclosporine / MMF ( 3 % and 2 % ) or sirolimus / MMF ( 3 % ) .
Patients in the Prograf group exhibited higher estimated creatinine clearance rates ( eCLcr ) using the Cockcroft - Gault formula ( Table 16 ) and experienced fewer efficacy failures , defined as biopsy proven acute rejection ( BPAR ) , graft loss , death , and / or lost to follow - up ( Table 17 ) in comparison to each of the other three groups .
Patients randomized to Prograf / MMF were more likely to develop diarrhea and diabetes after the transplantation and experienced similar rates of infections compared to patients randomized to either cyclosporine / MMF regimen [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .

The protocol - specified target tacrolimus trough concentrations ( Ctrough , Tac ) were 3 - 7 ng / mL ; however , the observed median Ctroughs , Tac approximated 7 ng / mL throughout the 12 month trial ( Table 18 ) .
Approximately 80 % of patients maintained tacrolimus whole blood concentrations between 4 - 11 ng / mL through 1 year post - transplant .

The protocol - specified target Ctroughs , CsA for Group A were 150 - 300 ng / mL for the first 3 months and 100 - 200 ng / mL from month 4 to month 12 ; the observed median Ctroughs , CsA approximated 225 ng / mL for the first 3 months and 140 ng / mL from month 4 to month 12 .
While patients in all groups started MMF at 1 gram twice daily , the MMF dose was reduced to less than 2 g per day in 63 % of patients in the tacrolimus treatment arm by month 12 ( Table 19 ) ; approximately 50 % of these MMF dose reductions were due to adverse reactions .
By comparison , the MMF dose was reduced to less than 2 g per day in 49 % and 45 % of patients in the two cyclosporine arms ( Group A and Group B , respectively ) , by month 12 and approximately 40 % of MMF dose reductions were due to adverse reactions .

MMF Dose Over Time in Prograf / MMF ( Group C ) ( Study 1 ) Key : Time - averaged MMF dose = ( total MMF dose ) / ( duration of treatment ) Time period ( Days ) Time - averaged MMF dose ( grams per day ) [ 1 ] Less than 2 . 0 2 . 0 Greater than 2 . 0 0 - 30 ( N = 364 ) 37 % 60 % 2 % 0 - 90 ( N = 373 ) 47 % 51 % 2 % 0 - 180 ( N = 377 ) 56 % 42 % 2 % 0 - 365 ( N = 380 ) 63 % 36 % 1 % [ 1 ] Percentage of patients for each time - averaged MMF dose range during various treatment periods .
Administration of 2 g per day of time - averaged MMF dose means that MMF dose was not reduced in those patients during the treatment periods .
In a second randomized , open - label , multi - center trial ( Study 2 ) , 424 kidney transplant patients received Prograf ( N = 212 ) or cyclosporine ( N = 212 ) in combination with MMF 1 gram twice daily , basiliximab induction , and corticosteroids .
In this trial , the rate for the combined endpoint of BPAR , graft failure , death , and / or lost to follow - up at 12 months in the Prograf / MMF group was similar to the rate in the cyclosporine / MMF group .
There was , however , an imbalance in mortality at 12 months in those patients receiving Prograf / MMF ( 4 % ) compared to those receiving cyclosporine / MMF ( 2 % ) , including cases attributed to overimmunosuppression ( Table 20 ) .

The observed median Ctroughs , CsA approximated 280 ng / mL during the first three months and 190 ng / mL from month 4 to month 12 .
Patients in both groups started MMF at 1 gram twice daily .
The MMF dose was reduced to less than 2 grams per day by month 12 in 62 % of patients in the Prograf / MMF group ( Table 22 ) and in 47 % of patients in the cyclosporine / MMF group .
Approximately 63 % and 55 % of these MMF dose reductions were because of adverse reactions in the Prograf / MMF group and the cyclosporine / MMF group , respectively [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .

14 . 2 Liver Transplantation The safety and efficacy of Prograf - based immunosuppression following orthotopic liver transplantation were assessed in two prospective , randomized , non - blinded multicenter trials .
The active control groups were treated with a cyclosporine - based immunosuppressive regimen ( CsA / AZA ) .
Both trials used concomitant adrenal corticosteroids as part of the immunosuppressive regimens .
These trials compared patient and graft survival rates at 12 months following transplantation .
In one trial , 529 patients were enrolled at 12 clinical sites in the United States ; prior to surgery , 263 were randomized to the Prograf - based immunosuppressive regimen and 266 to the CsA / AZA .
In 10 of the 12 sites , the same CsA / AZA protocol was used , while 2 sites used different control protocols .
This trial excluded patients with renal dysfunction , fulminant hepatic failure with Stage IV encephalopathy , and cancers ; pediatric patients ( ≤ 12 years old ) were allowed .
In the second trial , 545 patients were enrolled at 8 clinical sites in Europe ; prior to surgery , 270 were randomized to the Prograf - based immunosuppressive regimen and 275 to CsA / AZA .
In this trial , each center used its local standard CsA / AZA protocol in the active - control arm .
This trial excluded pediatric patients , but did allow enrollment of subjects with renal dysfunction , fulminant hepatic failure in Stage IV encephalopathy , and cancers other than primary hepatic with metastases .
One - year patient survival and graft survival in the Prograf - based treatment groups were similar to those in the CsA / AZA treatment groups in both trials .
The overall 1 - year patient survival ( CsA / AZA and Prograf - based treatment groups combined ) was 88 % in the U . S . trial and 78 % in the European trial .
The overall 1 - year graft survival ( CsA / AZA and Prograf - based treatment groups combined ) was 81 % in the U . S . trial and 73 % in the European trial .
In both trials , the median time to convert from IV to oral Prograf dosing was 2 days .
Although there is a lack of direct correlation between tacrolimus concentrations and drug efficacy , data from clinical trials of liver transplant patients have shown an increasing incidence of adverse reactions with increasing trough blood concentrations .
Most patients are stable when trough whole blood concentrations are maintained between 5 to 20 ng / mL .
Long - term post - transplant patients often are maintained at the low end of this target range .
Data from the U . S . clinical trial show that the median trough blood concentrations , measured at intervals from the second week to one year post - transplantation ranged from 9 . 8 ng / mL to 19 . 4 ng / mL .
14 . 3 Heart Transplantation Two open - label , randomized , comparative trials evaluated the safety and efficacy of Prograf - based and cyclosporine - based immunosuppression in primary orthotopic heart transplantation .
In a trial conducted in Europe , 314 patients received a regimen of antibody induction , corticosteroids and azathioprine in combination with Prograf or cyclosporine modified for 18 months .
In a 3 - arm trial conducted in the US , 331 patients received corticosteroids and Prograf plus sirolimus , Prograf plus mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) or cyclosporine modified plus MMF for 1 year .
In the European trial , patient / graft survival at 18 months post - transplant was similar between treatment arms , 92 % in the tacrolimus group and 90 % in the cyclosporine group .
In the U . S . trial , patient and graft survival at 12 months was similar with 93 % survival in the Prograf plus MMF group and 86 % survival in the cyclosporine modified plus MMF group .
In the European trial , the cyclosporine trough concentrations were above the pre - defined target range ( i . e . , 100 to 200 ng / mL ) at Day 122 and beyond in 32 to 68 % of the patients in the cyclosporine treatment arm , whereas the tacrolimus trough concentrations were within the pre - defined target range ( i . e . , 5 to 15 ng / mL ) in 74 to 86 % of the patients in the tacrolimus treatment arm .
Data from this European trial indicate that from 1 week to 3 months post - transplant , approximately 80 % of patients maintained trough concentrations between 8 to 20 ng / mL and , from 3 months through 18 months post - transplant , approximately 80 % of patients maintained trough concentrations between 6 to18 ng / mL .
The U . S . trial contained a third arm of a combination regimen of sirolimus , 2 mg per day , and full - dose Prograf ; however , this regimen was associated with increased risk of wound healing complications , renal function impairment , and insulin - dependent post - transplant diabetes mellitus , and is not recommended [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 12 ) ] .

How Does PROGRAF Protect My New Organ ?
The body ’ s immune system protects the body against anything that it does not recognize as part of the body .
For example , when the immune system detects a virus or bacteria it tries to get rid of it to prevent infection .
When a person has a liver , kidney , or heart transplant , the immune system does not recognize the new organ as a part of the body and tries to get rid of it , too .
This is called “ rejection ” .
PROGRAF protects your new organ by slowing down the body ’ s immune system .
