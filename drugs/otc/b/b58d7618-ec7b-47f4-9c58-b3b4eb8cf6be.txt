6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
Two double - blind , vehicle - controlled clinical trials were conducted in 702 adult subjects with actinic keratosis on the face or scalp .
Subjects were randomized 1 : 1 to KLISYRI or vehicle .
Subjects enrolled in the trials had 4 to 8 clinically typical , visible , and discrete AK lesions in a contiguous area of 25 cm2 on the face or scalp .
Subjects had an average age of 70 years ( range 45 to 96 years ) and were predominantly Caucasian ( 99 % ) , male ( 87 % ) , with Fitzpatrick skin types I or II ( 72 % ) and actinic keratosis on the face ( 68 % ) or scalp ( 32 % ) .
Treatment groups were comparable across all demographics and baseline characteristics , including AK lesion count and distribution on the face or scalp .
In the controlled trials , local skin reactions ( LSRs ) were collected independent of adverse events .
Local skin reactions including erythema , flaking / scaling , crusting , swelling , vesiculation / pustulation , erosions / ulcerations were assessed by the investigators using a grading scale of 0 = absent , 1 = mild ( slightly , barely perceptible ) , 2 = moderate ( distinct presence ) , and 3 = severe ( marked , intense ) .
The percentages of subjects with the maximal post - baseline grades for each local skin reaction greater than baseline by treatment group are provided in Table 1 .
LSRs were mostly mild to moderate in degree ( Table 1 ) .

Adverse Reaction System Organ Class KLISYRI N = 353 Vehicle N = 349 Number of Subjects ( % ) with any adverse reaction ( possibly related to treatment ) 56 ( 16 % ) 35 ( 10 % ) Application site pruritus 32 ( 9 % ) 21 ( 6 % ) Application site paina 35 ( 10 % ) 11 ( 3 % ) For the 51 subjects ( 45 KLISYRI , 6 vehicle ) who maintained complete clearance through the 12 - month follow - up period , no additional local adverse reactions were reported .
Dermal Safety Studies Clinical studies in healthy subjects demonstrated KLISYRI did not cause contact sensitization ( 261 subjects ) , phototoxic skin reactions ( 31 subjects ) , or photoallergic skin reactions ( 64 subjects ) .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with KLISYRI use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of tirbanibulin to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal deaths and malformations at a systemic exposure that was at least 74 times the exposure associated with the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) .
Oral administration of tirbanibulin to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in reduced mean fetal weight and size at a systemic exposure that was 159 times the exposure associated with the MRHD ( see Data ) .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Tirbanibulin induced fetal deaths and external , visceral , and skeletal malformations when administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses greater than or equal to 1 . 25 mg / kg / day , which resulted in systemic exposures at least 74 times the exposure associated with the MRHD on an Area Under the Curve ( AUC ) comparison basis .
Tirbanibulin had no apparent effects on fetal development in rats at a dose of 0 . 5 mg / kg / day , which resulted in systemic exposures 18 times the exposure associated with the MRHD .
Tirbanibulin reduced mean fetal weight and size ( crown - rump length ) when administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at a dose of 3 mg / kg / day , which resulted in a systemic exposure 159 times the exposure associated with the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis .
Tirbanibulin had no apparent effects on fetal development in rabbits at a dose of 1 mg / kg / day , which resulted in systemic exposures 53 times the exposure associated with the MRHD .
Tirbanibulin was assessed for effects on peri - and post - natal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis through lactation at dosages up to 1 . 25 mg / kg / day .
These dosages resulted in systemic exposures up to 74 times the exposure associated with the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis .
No adverse effects on maternal function or developmental , neurobehavioral , or reproductive performance of offspring were observed .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on lactational transfer of KLISYRI to human or animal milk .
The effects of KLISYRI on the breastfed infant , or its effects on milk production , are unknown .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for KLISYRI and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from tirbanibulin or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of KLISYRI for actinic keratosis in subjects less than 18 years of age have not been established .
Actinic keratosis is not a condition generally seen within the pediatric population .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 353 subjects with AK treated with KLISYRI in the 2 controlled Phase 3 trials , 246 ( 70 % ) were 65 years of age or older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdose of KLISYRI could cause an increase in incidence and severity of local skin reactions .
11 DESCRIPTION KLISYRI ( tirbanibulin ) ointment is a microtubule inhibitor for topical use .
The chemical name of tirbanibulin is N - benzyl - 2 - ( 5 - ( 4 - ( 2 - morpholinoethoxy ) phenyl ) pyridin - 2 - yl ) acetamide .
The molecular weight is 431 . 4 and the molecular formula is C26H29N3O3 .
Tirbanibulin ’ s structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Tirbanibulin ointment 1 % contains 10 mg tirbanibulin per gram of white to off - white ointment containing mono - and di - glycerides and propylene glycol .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Tirbanibulin is a microtubule inhibitor .
The mechanism of action of KLISYRI for the topical treatment of actinic keratosis is unknown .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of tirbanibulin in the treatment of actinic keratosis is unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following topical treatment of a mean daily dose of 138 mg ( range : 54 to 295 mg ) of KLISYRI to a 25 cm2 contiguous area of the face or balding scalp , once daily for 5 consecutive days , the steady - state concentration of tirbanibulin was achieved by 72 hours with a mean ± SD trough concentration ( Ctrough ) of 0 . 11 ± 0 . 08 ng / mL .
On Day 5 , systemic exposure to tirbanibulin was low with a mean ± SD maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) of 0 . 34 ± 0 . 30 ng / mL and 0 . 18 ± 0 . 10 ng / mL , and a mean ± SD area under the plasma concentration from time zero to 24 hours ( AUC24 ) of 5 . 0 ± 3 . 9 h * ng / mL and 3 . 2 ± 1 . 9 h * ng / mL , in subjects who received the face and scalp topical treatment , respectively .
The median time to reach Cmax ( Tmax ) was ~ 7 hours .
Distribution Plasma protein binding of tirbanibulin is 88 % and is independent of concentrations in the range of 0 . 01 to 10 µg / mL .
Elimination Metabolism Following topical treatment with KLISYRI to adult subjects with actinic keratosis , the plasma concentrations of KX2 - 5036 and KX2 - 5163 , two pharmacologically inactive metabolites , were detectable with the highest plasma concentrations of 0 . 09 ng / mL and 0 . 12 ng / mL , respectively .
The in vitro study indicated that incubation of 1 or 10 µM tirbanibulin with human hepatocytes generated KX2 - 5036 , KX - 5163 and other unidentified metabolites .
In vitro , tirbanibulin is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 , and to a lesser extent , CYP2C8 .
Excretion Excretion of tirbanibulin has not been fully characterized in humans .
Drug Interactions Clinical Studies No clinical studies evaluating the drug interaction potential of KLISYRI have been conducted .
In Vitro Studies CYP Enzymes : Tirbanibulin and the metabolite KX2 - 5036 directly or time - dependently inhibited CYP 1A2 , 2B6 , 2C8 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , or 3A4 with an IC50 value of > 17 µM .
Tirbanibulin up to 1 µM ( 431 . 5 ng / mL ) and the metabolite KX2 - 5036 up to 3 µM ( 1024 ng / mL ) did not induce CYP 1A2 , 2B6 , or 3A4 .
These findings suggest that KLISYRI has no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of drugs metabolized by CYP 1A2 , 2B6 , 2C8 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , or 3A4 .
Drug Transporters : Neither tirbanibulin nor the metabolite KX2 - 5036 was a substrate of MDR1 , BCRP , BSEP , MRP2 , MATE1 , MATE2 - K , OAT1 , OAT3 , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OCT1 or OCT2 .
Tirbanibulin and the metabolite KX2 - 5036 inhibited MATE1 , MATE2 - K , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OCT1 and / or OCT2 with an IC50 value of > 1 µM .
The results suggest that KLISYRI has no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of drugs mediated by MATE1 , MATE2 - K , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OCT1 and OCT2 .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No studies have been performed to evaluate the potential of tirbanibulin to induce carcinogenesis .
Tirbanibulin was negative in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay .
Tirbanibulin was positive in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay with Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells , an in vitro mouse lymphoma assay with L5178 / TK + / - cells , and an in vivo micronucleus assay in rats .
Tirbanibulin was assessed for effects on fertility or reproductive function in rats .
Reproductive performance of rats was unaffected by oral doses of tirbanibulin up to 4 mg / kg / day ( 94 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis ) in males and 1 mg / kg / day ( 60 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis ) in females .
However , oral administration of 4 mg / kg / day of tirbanibulin to male rats adversely affected spermatogenesis , including reduced sperm count and motility , and increased observations of morphologically abnormal sperm .
No effects on sperm were observed in males treated at 2 mg / kg / day ( 47 times the MRHD on an AUC comparison basis ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Actinic Keratosis of the Face or Scalp Two double - blind , vehicle - controlled clinical trials ( NCT03285477 and NCT03285490 ) were conducted with 702 adult subjects with actinic keratosis on the face or scalp .
Subjects were randomized 1 : 1 to KLISYRI or vehicle .
Subjects enrolled had 4 to 8 clinically typical , visible , and discrete AK lesions in a contiguous area of 25 cm2 on the face or scalp .
Subjects had an average age of 70 years ( range 45 to 96 years ) , were predominantly Caucasian ( 99 % ) , male ( 87 % ) , with Fitzpatrick skin types I or II ( 72 % ) and actinic keratosis on the face ( 68 % ) or scalp ( 32 % ) .
Treatment groups were comparable across all demographics and baseline characteristics , including AK lesion count and distribution on the face or scalp .
Subjects received 5 consecutive days of once daily treatment with either KLISYRI ( 353 ) or vehicle control ( 349 ) to the treatment field .
Subjects with complete ( 100 % ) clearance of AK lesions in the treatment area at Day 57 returned to the clinic for recurrence assessment every 3 months for a total of 12 months post - Day 57 .
The primary efficacy endpoint was complete ( 100 % ) clearance of AK lesions in the treatment area , defined as the proportion of subjects at Day 57 with no clinically visible AK lesions in the treatment area and the secondary endpoint was partial ( ≥ 75 % ) clearance of AK lesions in the treatment area .
