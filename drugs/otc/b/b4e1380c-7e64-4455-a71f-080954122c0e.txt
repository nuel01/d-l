The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with KALETRA : • The use of other active agents with KALETRA is associated with a greater likelihood of treatment response [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
• Genotypic or phenotypic testing and / or treatment history should guide the use of KALETRA [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
The number of baseline primary protease inhibitor mutations affects the virologic response to KALETRA [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
• Once daily administration of KALETRA is not recommended for therapy - experienced adult patients or any pediatric patients .
KALETRA is an HIV - 1 protease inhibitor indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV - 1 infection .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION KALETRA tablets may be taken with or without food .
The tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed , broken , or crushed .

2 . 1 Adult Patients Therapy - Naïve Patients • KALETRA tablets 400 / 100 mg ( given as two 200 / 50 mg tablets ) twice daily taken with or without food .
• KALETRA oral solution 400 / 100 mg ( 5 mL ) twice daily taken with food .
• KALETRA tablets 800 / 200 mg ( given as four 200 / 50 mg tablets ) once daily taken with or without food .
• KALETRA oral solution 800 / 200 mg ( 10 mL ) once daily taken with food .
Therapy - Experienced Patients Once daily administration of KALETRA is not recommended in therapy - experienced patients .
• KALETRA tablets 400 / 100 mg ( given as two 200 / 50 mg tablets ) twice daily taken with or without food .
• KALETRA oral solution 400 / 100 mg ( 5 mL ) twice daily taken with food .
Concomitant Therapy : Efavirenz , nevirapine , ( fos ) amprenavir or nelfinavir [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] KALETRA tablets and oral solution should not be administered as a once daily regimen in combination with efavirenz , nevirapine , ( fos ) amprenavir or nelfinavir .
• A dose increase is recommended for all patients who use KALETRA tablets .
The recommended dose of KALETRA tablets is 500 / 125 mg ( such as two 200 / 50 tablets and one 100 / 25 mg tablet ) twice daily in combination with efavirenz , nevirapine , ( fos ) amprenavir or nelfinavir .
• A dose increase is recommended for all patients who use KALETRA oral solution .
The recommended dose of KALETRA oral solution is 533 / 133 mg ( 6 . 5 mL ) twice daily taken with food when used in combination with efavirenz , nevirapine , ( fos ) amprenavir or nelfinavir .
2 . 2 Pediatric Patients KALETRA tablets and oral solution should not be administered once daily in pediatric patients < 18 years of age .
Healthcare professionals should pay special attention to accurate calculation of the dose of KALETRA , transcription of the medication order , dispensing information and dosing instructions to minimize the risk for medication errors , overdose , [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ] and underdose .
Prescribers should calculate the appropriate dose of KALETRA for each individual child based on body weight ( kg ) or body surface area ( BSA ) and should not exceed the recommended adult dose .
Body surface area ( BSA ) can be calculated as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The KALETRA dose can be calculated based on weight or BSA : Based on Weight : Patient Weight ( kg ) × Prescribed lopinavir dose ( mg / kg ) = Administered lopinavir dose ( mg ) Based on BSA : Patient BSA ( m2 ) × Prescribed lopinavir dose ( mg / m2 ) = Administered lopinavir dose ( mg ) If KALETRA oral solution is used , the volume ( mL ) of KALETRA solution can be determined as follows : Volume of KALETRA solution ( mL ) = Administered lopinavir dose ( mg ) ÷ 80 ( mg / mL ) The dose of the oral solution should be administered using a calibrated dosing syringe .
Before prescribing KALETRA 100 / 25 mg tablets , children should be assessed for the ability to swallow intact tablets .
If a child is unable to reliably swallow a KALETRA tablet , the KALETRA oral solution formulation should be prescribed .
14 Days to 6 Months : In pediatric patients 14 days to 6 months of age , the recommended dosage of lopinavir / ritonavir using KALETRA oral solution is 16 / 4 mg / kg or 300 / 75 mg / m2 twice daily .
Prescribers should calculate the appropriate dose based on body weight or body surface area .
Because no data exists for dosage when administered with efavirenz , nevirapine , ( fos ) amprenavir , or nelfinavir , it is recommended that KALETRA not be administered in combination with these drugs in patients < 6 months of age .
6 Months to 18 Years : Without Concomitant Efavirenz , Nevirapine , ( Fos ) amprenavir or Nelfinavir In children 6 months to 18 years of age , the recommended dosage of lopinavir / ritonavir using KALETRA oral solution without concomitant efavirenz , nevirapine , ( fos ) amprenavir , or nelfinavir is 230 / 57 . 5 mg / m2 given twice daily , not to exceed the recommended adult dose .
If weight - based dosing is preferred , the recommended dosage of lopinavir / ritonavir for patients < 15 kg is 12 / 3 mg / kg given twice daily and the dosage for patients ≥ 15 kg to 40 kg is 10 / 2 . 5 mg / kg given twice daily .
Table 1 provides the dosing recommendations for pediatric patients 6 months to 18 years of age based on body weight or body surface area for KALETRA tablets .

● Co - administration of KALETRA is contraindicated with potent CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced lopinavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance and cross - resistance .
These drugs are listed in Table 3 .
Table 3 .
Drugs That Are Contraindicated With KALETRADrug Class Drugs Within Class That Are Contraindicated With KALETRA Clinical comments : asee Drug Interactions , Table 9 for parenterally administered midazolam Antimycobacterial Rifampin May lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to KALETRA or to the class of protease inhibitors or other co - administered antiretroviral agents .
[ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] Ergot Derivatives Dihydroergotamine , ergonovine , ergotamine , methylergonovine Potential for acute ergot toxicity characterized by peripheral vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues .
GI motility agent Cisapride Potential for cardiac arrhythmias .
Herbal Products St Johns wort ( hypericum perforatum ) May lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to KALETRA or to the class of protease inhibitors .
HMG - CoA Reductase Inhibitors Lovastatin , simvastatin Potential for myopathy including rhabdomyolysis .
Neuroleptic Pimozide Potential for cardiac arrhythmias .
Sedative / Hypnotics Triazolam ; orally administered midazolama Prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression .
Hypersensitivity to KALETRA ( e . g . , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , erythema multiforme ) or any of its ingredients , including ritonavir .
( 4 ) Coadministration with : ● drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma levels may result in serious and / or life - threatening events .
( 4 ) ● potent CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced lopinavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance and cross resistance .
( 4 ) The following have been observed in patients receiving KALETRA : ● Drug Interactions : Consider drug - drug interaction potential to reduce risk of serious or life - threatening adverse reactions .
( 5 . 1 ) ● Pancreatitis : Fatalities have occurred ; suspend therapy as clinically appropriate .
( 5 . 2 ) ● Hepatotoxicity : Fatalities have occurred .
Monitor liver function before and during therapy , especially in patients with underlying hepatic disease , including hepatitis B and hepatitis C , or marked transaminase elevations .
( 5 . 3 , 8 . 6 ) ● PR interval prolongation may occur in some patients .
Cases of second and third degree heart block have been reported .
Use with caution in patients with preexisting conduction system disease , ischemic heart disease , cardiomyopathy , underlying structural heart disease or when administering with other drugs that may prolong the PR interval .
( 5 . 1 , 5 . 5 , 12 . 3 ) ● QT interval prolongation and isolated cases of torsade de pointes have been reported although causality could not be established .
Avoid use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome , those with hypokalemia , and with other drugs that prolong the QT interval .
( 5 . 1 , 5 . 6 , 12 . 3 ) ● Patients may develop new onset or exacerbations of diabetes mellitus , hyperglycemia ( 5 . 4 ) , immune reconstitution syndrome ( 5 . 7 ) , redistribution / accumulation of body fat .
( 5 . 8 ) ● Total cholesterol and triglycerides elevations .
Monitor prior to therapy and periodically thereafter .
( 5 . 9 ) ● Hemophilia : Spontaneous bleeding may occur , and additional factor VIII may be required .
( 5 . 10 ) 5 . 1 Drug Interactions See Tables 3 and 9 for listing of drugs that are contraindicated for use with KALETRA due to potentially life - threatening adverse events , significant drug interactions , or loss of virologic activity [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
5 . 2 Pancreatitis Pancreatitis has been observed in patients receiving KALETRA therapy , including those who developed marked triglyceride elevations .
In some cases , fatalities have been observed .
Although a causal relationship to KALETRA has not been established , marked triglyceride elevations are a risk factor for development of pancreatitis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] .
Patients with advanced HIV - 1 disease may be at increased risk of elevated triglycerides and pancreatitis , and patients with a history of pancreatitis may be at increased risk for recurrence during KALETRA therapy .
Pancreatitis should be considered if clinical symptoms ( nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain ) or abnormalities in laboratory values ( such as increased serum lipase or amylase values ) suggestive of pancreatitis occur .
Patients who exhibit these signs or symptoms should be evaluated and KALETRA and / or other antiretroviral therapy should be suspended as clinically appropriate .
5 . 3 Hepatotoxicity Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C or marked elevations in transaminase prior to treatment may be at increased risk for developing or worsening of transaminase elevations or hepatic decompensation with use of KALETRA .
There have been postmarketing reports of hepatic dysfunction , including some fatalities .
These have generally occurred in patients with advanced HIV - 1 disease taking multiple concomitant medications in the setting of underlying chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis .
A causal relationship with KALETRA therapy has not been established .
Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with KALETRA and patients should be monitored closely during treatment .
Increased AST / ALT monitoring should be considered in the patients with underlying chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis , especially during the first several months of KALETRA treatment [ see Use In Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
5 . 4 Diabetes Mellitus / Hyperglycemia New onset diabetes mellitus , exacerbation of pre - existing diabetes mellitus , and hyperglycemia have been reported during post - marketing surveillance in HIV - 1 infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy .
Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events .
In some cases , diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred .
In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy , hyperglycemia persisted in some cases .
Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice , estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established .
5 . 5 PR Interval Prolongation Lopinavir / ritonavir prolongs the PR interval in some patients .
Cases of second or third degree atrioventricular block have been reported .
KALETRA should be used with caution in patients with underlying structural heart disease , preexisting conduction system abnormalities , ischemic heart disease or cardiomyopathies , as these patients may be at increased risk for developing cardiac conduction abnormalities .
The impact on the PR interval of co - administration of KALETRA with other drugs that prolong the PR interval ( including calcium channel blockers , beta - adrenergic blockers , digoxin and atazanavir ) has not been evaluated .
As a result , co - administration of KALETRA with these drugs should be undertaken with caution , particularly with those drugs metabolized by CYP3A .
Clinical monitoring is recommended [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 6 QT Interval Prolongation Postmarketing cases of QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes have been reported although causality of KALETRA could not be established .
Avoid use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome , those with hypokalemia , and with other drugs that prolong the QT interval [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy , including KALETRA .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [ PCP ] , or tuberculosis ) which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
5 . 8 Fat Redistribution Redistribution / accumulation of body fat including central obesity , dorsocervical fat enlargement ( buffalo hump ) , peripheral wasting , facial wasting , breast enlargement , and " cushingoid appearance " have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy .
The mechanism and long - term consequences of these events are currently unknown .
A causal relationship has not been established .
5 . 9 Lipid Elevations Treatment with KALETRA has resulted in large increases in the concentration of total cholesterol and triglycerides [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Triglyceride and cholesterol testing should be performed prior to initiating KALETRA therapy and at periodic intervals during therapy .
Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate , taking into account any potential drug - drug interactions with KALETRA and HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 10 Patients with Hemophilia Increased bleeding , including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis have been reported in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors .
In some patients additional factor VIII was given .
In more than half of the reported cases , treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced .
A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established .
5 . 11 Resistance / Cross - resistance Because the potential for HIV cross - resistance among protease inhibitors has not been fully explored in KALETRA - treated patients , it is unknown what effect therapy with KALETRA will have on the activity of subsequently administered protease inhibitors [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling .
• PR Interval Prolongation , QT Interval Prolongation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 , 5 . 6 ) ] • Drug Interactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Pancreatitis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Hepatotoxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .

The adverse reaction profile seen during Study 940 was similar to that for adult patients .
Dysgeusia ( 22 % ) , vomiting ( 21 % ) , and diarrhea ( 12 % ) were the most common adverse reactions of any severity reported in pediatric patients treated with combination therapy for up to 48 weeks in Study 940 .
A total of 8 patients experienced adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity .
The adverse reactions meeting these criteria and reported for the 8 subjects include : hypersensitivity ( characterized by fever , rash and jaundice ) , pyrexia , viral infection , constipation , hepatomegaly , pancreatitis , vomiting , alanine aminotransferase increased , dry skin , rash , and dysgeusia .
Rash was the only event of those listed that occurred in 2 or more subjects ( N = 3 ) .
KALETRA oral solution dosed at 300 / 75 mg / m2 has been studied in 31 pediatric patients 14 days to 6 months of age .
The adverse reaction profile in Study 1030 was similar to that observed in older children and adults .
No adverse reaction was reported in greater than 10 % of subjects .
Adverse drug reactions of moderate to severe intensity occurring in 2 or more subjects included decreased neutrophil count ( N = 3 ) , anemia ( N = 2 ) , high potassium ( N = 2 ) , and low sodium ( N = 2 ) .
KALETRA oral solution and soft gelatin capsules dosed at higher than recommended doses including 400 / 100 mg / m2 ( without concomitant NNRTI ) and 480 / 120 mg / m2 ( with concomitant NNRTI ) have been studied in 26 pediatric patients 7 to 18 years of age in Study 1038 .
Patients also had saquinavir mesylate added to their regimen at Week 4 .
Rash ( 12 % ) , blood cholesterol abnormal ( 12 % ) and blood triglycerides abnormal ( 12 % ) were the only adverse reactions reported in greater than 10 % of subjects .
Adverse drug reactions of moderate to severe intensity occurring in 2 or more subjects included rash ( N = 3 ) , blood triglycerides abnormal ( N = 3 ) , and electrocardiogram QT prolonged ( N = 2 ) .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS See also Contraindications ( 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) Coadministration of KALETRA can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentrations of lopinavir .
The potential for drug - drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy .
( 4 , 5 . 1 , 7 , 12 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Potential for KALETRA to Affect Other Drugs Lopinavir / ritonavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A and may increase plasma concentrations of agents that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A .
Agents that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A and have high first pass metabolism appear to be the most susceptible to large increases in AUC ( > 3 - fold ) when co - administered with KALETRA .
Thus , co - administration of KALETRA with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and / or life - threatening events is contraindicated .
Co - administration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring as shown in Table 9 .
Additionally , KALETRA induces glucuronidation .
7 . 2 Potential For Other Drugs To Affect Lopinavir Lopinavir / ritonavir is a CYP3A substrate ; therefore , drugs that induce CYP3A may decrease lopinavir plasma concentrations and reduce KALETRA ’ s therapeutic effect .
Although not observed in the KALETRA / ketoconazole drug interaction study , co - administration of KALETRA and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A may increase lopinavir plasma concentrations .
7 . 3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Table 9 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions .
Alteration in dose or regimen may be recommended based on drug interaction studies or predicted interaction [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) for magnitude of interaction ] .
Table 9 .
Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug InteractionsConcomitant Drug Class : Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Lopinavir or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment * see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) for Magnitude of Interaction .
HIV - 1 Antiviral Agents Non - nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors : efavirenz * , nevirapine * ↓ lopinavir KALETRA dose increase is recommended in all patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Increasing the dose of KALETRA tablets to 500 / 125 mg ( given as two 200 / 50 mg tablets and one 100 / 25 mg tablet ) twice daily co - administered with efavirenz resulted in similar lopinavir concentrations compared to KALETRA tablets 400 / 100 mg ( given as two 200 / 50 mg tablets ) twice daily without efavirenz .
Increasing the dose of KALETRA tablets to 600 / 150 mg ( given as three 200 / 50 mg tablets ) twice daily co - administered with efavirenz resulted in significantly higher lopinavir plasma concentrations compared to KALETRA tablets 400 / 100 mg twice daily without efavirenz .
KALETRA should not be administered once daily in combination with efavirenz or nevirapine .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Non - nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor : delavirdine ↑ lopinavir Appropriate doses of the combination with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established .
Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor : didanosine KALETRA tablets can be administered simultaneously with didanosine without food .
For KALETRA oral solution , it is recommended that didanosine be administered on an empty stomach ; therefore , didanosine should be given one hour before or two hours after KALETRA oral solution ( given with food ) .
Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor : tenofovir ↑ tenofovir KALETRA increases tenofovir concentrations .
The mechanism of this interaction is unknown .
Patients receiving KALETRA and tenofovir should be monitored for adverse reactions associated with tenofovir .
Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor : abacavir zidovudine ↓ abacavir ↓ zidovudine KALETRA induces glucuronidation ; therefore , KALETRA has the potential to reduce zidovudine and abacavir plasma concentrations .
The clinical significance of this potential interaction is unknown .
HIV - 1 Protease Inhibitor : amprenavir * ↑ amprenavir ↓ lopinavir KALETRA should not be administered once daily in combination with amprenavir .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
HIV - 1 Protease Inhibitor : fosamprenavir / ritonavir ↓ amprenavir ↓ lopinavir An increased rate of adverse reactions has been observed with co - administration of these medications .
Appropriate doses of the combinations with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established .
HIV - 1 Protease Inhibitor : indinavir * ↑ indinavir Decrease indinavir dose to 600 mg twice daily , when co - administered with KALETRA 400 / 100 mg twice daily [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
KALETRA once daily has not been studied in combination with indinavir .
HIV - 1 Protease Inhibitor : nelfinavir * ↑ nelfinavir ↑ M8 metabolite of nelfinavir ↓ lopinavir KALETRA should not be administered once daily in combination with nelfinavir .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
HIV - 1 Protease Inhibitor : ritonavir * ↑ lopinavir Appropriate doses of additional ritonavir in combination with KALETRA with respect to safety and efficacy have not been established .
HIV - 1 Protease Inhibitor : saquinavir * ↑ saquinavir The saquinavir dose is 1000 mg twice daily , when co - administered with KALETRA 400 / 100 mg twice daily .
KALETRA once daily has not been studied in combination with saquinavir .
HIV - 1 Protease Inhibitor : tipranavir ↓ lopinavir AUC and Cmin KALETRA should not be administered with tipranavir ( 500 mg twice daily ) co - administered with ritonavir ( 200 mg twice daily ) .
HIV CCR5 – antagonist : maraviroc ↑ maraviroc Concurrent administration of maraviroc with KALETRA will increase plasma levels of maraviroc .
When co - administered , patients should receive 150 mg twice daily of maraviroc .
For further details see complete prescribing information for Selzentry ® ( maraviroc ) .
Other Agents Antiarrhythmics : amiodarone , bepridil , lidocaine ( systemic ) , and quinidine ↑ antiarrhythmics Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring ( if available ) is recommended for antiarrhythmics when co - administered with KALETRA .
Anticancer Agents : vincristine vinblastine ↑ anticancer agents Concentrations of vincristine or vinblastine may be increased when co - administered with lopinavir / ritonavir ( KALETRA ) resulting in the potential for increased adverse events usually associated with these anticancer agents .
Consideration should be given to temporarily withholding the ritonavir - containing antiretroviral regimen in patients who develop significant hematologic or gastrointestinal side effects when lopinavir / ritonavir ( KALETRA ) is administered concurrently with vincristine or vinblastine .
If the antiretroviral regimen must be withheld for a prolonged period , consideration should be given to initiating a revised regimen that does not include a CYP3A or P - gp inhibitor .
Anticoagulant : warfarin Concentrations of warfarin may be affected .
It is recommended that INR ( international normalized ratio ) be monitored .
Anticonvulsants : carbamazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin ↓ lopinavir ↓ phenytoin KALETRA may be less effective due to decreased lopinavir plasma concentrations in patients taking these agents concomitantly and should be used with caution .
KALETRA should not be administered once daily in combination with carbamazepine , phenobarbital , or phenytoin .
In addition , co - administration of phenytoin and KALETRA may cause decreases in steady - state phenytoin concentrations .
Phenytoin levels should be monitored when co - administering with KALETRA .
Antidepressant : bupropion ↓ bupropion ↓ active metabolite , hydroxybupropion Concurrent administration of bupropion with KALETRA may decrease plasma levels of both bupropion and its active metabolite ( hydroxybupropion ) .
Patients receiving KALETRA and bupropion concurrently should be monitored for an adequate clinical response to bupropion .
Antidepressant : trazodone ↑ trazodone Concomitant use of trazodone and KALETRA may increase concentrations of trazodone .
Adverse reactions of nausea , dizziness , hypotension and syncope have been observed following co - administration of trazodone and ritonavir .
If trazodone is used with a CYP3A4 inhibitor such as ritonavir , the combination should be used with caution and a lower dose of trazodone should be considered .
Anti - infective : clarithromycin ↑ clarithromycin For patients with renal impairment , the following dosage adjustments should be considered : • For patients with CLCR 30 to 60 mL / min the dose of clarithromycin should be reduced by 50 % .
• For patients with CLCR < 30 mL / min the dose of clarithromycin should be decreased by 75 % .
No dose adjustment for patients with normal renal function is necessary .
Antifungals : ketoconazole * , itraconazole , voriconazole ↑ ketoconazole ↑ itraconazole ↓ voriconazole High doses of ketoconazole ( > 200 mg / day ) or itraconazole ( > 200 mg / day ) are not recommended .
Co - administration of voriconazole with KALETRA has not been studied .
However , a study has been shown that administration of voriconazole with ritonavir 100 mg every 12 hours decreased voriconazole steady - state AUC by an average of 39 % ; therefore , co - administration of KALETRA and voriconazole may result in decreased voriconazole concentrations and the potential for decreased voriconazole effectiveness and should be avoided , unless an assessment of the benefit / risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole .
Otherwise , alternative antifungal therapies should be considered in these patients .
Antimycobacterial : rifabutin * ↑ rifabutin and rifabutin metabolite Dosage reduction of rifabutin by at least 75 % of the usual dose of 300 mg / day is recommended ( i . e . , a maximum dose of 150 mg every other day or three times per week ) .
Increased monitoring for adverse reactions is warranted in patients receiving the combination .
Further dosage reduction of rifabutin may be necessary .
Antimycobacterial : rifampin ↓ lopinavir May lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to KALETRA or to the class of protease inhibitors or other co - administered antiretroviral agents .
A study evaluated combination of rifampin 600 mg once daily , with KALETRA 800 / 200 mg twice daily or KALETRA 400 / 100 mg + ritonavir 300 mg twice daily .
Pharmacokinetic and safety results from this study do not allow for a dose recommendation .
Nine subjects ( 28 % ) experienced a ≥ grade 2 increase in ALT / AST , of which seven ( 21 % ) prematurely discontinued study per protocol .
Based on the study design , it is not possible to determine whether the frequency or magnitude of the ALT / AST elevations observed is higher than what would be seen with rifampin alone .
[ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) for magnitude of interaction ] .
Antiparasitic : atovaquone ↓ atovaquone Clinical significance is unknown ; however , increase in atovaquone doses may be needed .
Benzodiazepines : parenterally administered midazolam ↑ midazolam Midazolam is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 .
Increases in the concentration of midazolam are expected to be significantly higher with oral than parenteral administration .
Therefore , KALETRA should not be given with orally administered midazolam [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
If KALETRA is coadministered with parenteral midazolam , close clinical monitoring for respiratory depression and / or prolonged sedation should be exercised and dosage adjustment should be considered .
Calcium Channel Blockers , dihydropyridine : e . g . , felodipine , nifedipine , nicardipine ↑ dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients is recommended .
Corticosteroid : dexamethasone ↓ lopinavir Use with caution .
KALETRA may be less effective due to decreased lopinavir plasma concentrations in patients taking these agents concomitantly .
disulfiram / metronidazole KALETRA oral solution contains alcohol , which can produce disulfiram - like reactions when co - administered with disulfiram or other drugs that produce this reaction ( e . g . , metronidazole ) .
PDE5 inhibitors : sildenafil , tadalafil , vardenafil ↑ sildenafil ↑ tadalafil ↑ vardenafil Particular caution should be used when prescribing sildenafil , tadalafil , or vardenafil in patients receiving KALETRA .
Co - administration of KALETRA with these drugs is expected to substantially increase their concentrations and may result in an increase in associated adverse reactions including hypotension , syncope , visual changes and prolonged erection .
It is recommended not to exceed the following doses : • Sildenafil : 25 mg every 48 hours • Tadalafil : 10 mg every 72 hours • Vardenafil : 2 . 5 mg every 72 hours HMG - CoA Reductase Inhibitors : atorvastatin rosuvastatin ↑ atorvastatin ↑ rosuvastatin Use lowest possible dose of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin with careful monitoring , or consider other HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors such as pravastatin or fluvastatin in combination with KALETRA .
Immunosuppressants : cyclosporine , tacrolimus , rapamycin ↑ immunosuppressants Therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for immunosuppressant agents when co - administered with KALETRA .
Inhaled Steroid : fluticasone ↑ fluticasone Concomitant use of fluticasone propionate and KALETRA may increase plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate , resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations .
Systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing ' s syndrome and adrenal suppression have been reported during post - marketing use in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate .
Co - administration of fluticasone propionate and KALETRA is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effect .
Narcotic Analgesic : methadone * ↓ methadone Dosage of methadone may need to be increased when co - administered with KALETRA .
Contraceptive : ethinyl estradiol * ↓ ethinyl estradiol Because contraceptive steroid concentrations may be altered when KALETRA is co - administered with oral contraceptives or with the contraceptive patch , alternative methods of nonhormonal contraception are recommended .
7 . 4 Drugs with No Observed or Predicted Interactions with KALETRA Drug interaction studies reveal no clinically significant interaction between KALETRA and desipramine ( CYP2D6 probe ) , pravastatin , stavudine , lamivudine , omeprazole or ranitidine .
Based on known metabolic profiles , clinically significant drug interactions are not expected between KALETRA and fluvastatin , dapsone , trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole , azithromycin , erythromycin , or fluconazole .
● Pregnancy : Physicians are encouraged to register patients in the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry by calling 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
( 8 . 1 ) ● Pediatric Use : The safety , efficacy , and pharmacokinetic profiles of KALETRA in pediatric patients below the age of 14 days have not been established .
( 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C . No treatment - related malformations were observed when lopinavir in combination with ritonavir was administered to pregnant rats or rabbits .
Embryonic and fetal developmental toxicities ( early resorption , decreased fetal viability , decreased fetal body weight , increased incidence of skeletal variations and skeletal ossification delays ) occurred in rats at a maternally toxic dosage .
Based on AUC measurements , the drug exposures in rats at the toxic doses were approximately 0 . 7 - fold for lopinavir and 1 . 8 - fold for ritonavir for males and females that of the exposures in humans at the recommended therapeutic dose ( 400 / 100 mg twice daily ) .
In a peri - and postnatal study in rats , a developmental toxicity ( a decrease in survival in pups between birth and postnatal Day 21 ) occurred .
No embryonic and fetal developmental toxicities were observed in rabbits at a maternally toxic dosage .
Based on AUC measurements , the drug exposures in rabbits at the toxic doses were approximately 0 . 6 - fold for lopinavir and 1 . 0 - fold for ritonavir that of the exposures in humans at the recommended therapeutic dose ( 400 / 100 mg twice daily ) .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
KALETRA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry : To monitor maternal - fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to KALETRA , an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established .
Physicians are encouraged to register patients by calling 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV - 1 infected mothers not breast - feed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV - 1 .
Studies in rats have demonstrated that lopinavir is secreted in milk .
It is not known whether lopinavir is secreted in human milk .
Because of both the potential for HIV - 1 transmission and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants , mothers should be instructed not to breast - feed if they are receiving KALETRA .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety , efficacy , and pharmacokinetic profiles of KALETRA in pediatric patients below the age of 14 days have not been established .
KALETRA once daily has not been evaluated in pediatric patients .
An open - label , multi - center , dose - finding trial was performed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile , tolerability , safety and efficacy of KALETRA oral solution containing lopinavir 80 mg / mL and ritonavir 20 mg / mL at a dose of with 300 / 75 mg / m2 twice daily plus two NRTIs in HIV - infected infants ≥ 14 days and < 6 months of age .
Results revealed that infants younger than 6 months of age generally had lower lopinavir AUC12 than older children ( 6 months to 12 years of age ) , however , despite the lower lopinavir drug exposure observed , antiviral activity was demonstrated as reflected in the proportion of subjects who achieved HIV - RNA < 400 copies / mL at Week 24 [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients > 6 months of age was demonstrated in a clinical trial in 100 patients .
The clinical trial was an open - label , multicenter trial evaluating the pharmacokinetic profile , tolerability , safety , and efficacy of KALETRA oral solution containing lopinavir 80 mg / mL and ritonavir 20 mg / mL in 100 antiretroviral naïve and experienced pediatric patients ages 6 months to 12 years .
Dose selection for patients 6 months to 12 years of age was based on the following results .
The 230 / 57 . 5 mg / m2 oral solution twice daily regimen without nevirapine and the 300 / 75 mg / m2 oral solution twice daily regimen with nevirapine provided lopinavir plasma concentrations similar to those obtained in adult patients receiving the 400 / 100 mg twice daily regimen ( without nevirapine ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
A prospective multicenter , open - label trial evaluated the pharmacokinetic profile , tolerability , safety and efficacy of high - dose KALETRA with or without concurrent NNRTI therapy ( Group 1 : 400 / 100 mg / m2 twice daily + ≥ 2 NRTIs ; Group 2 : 480 / 120 mg / m2 twice daily + ≥ 1 NRTI + 1 NNRTI ) in children and adolescents ≥ 2 years to < 18 years of age who had failed prior therapy .
Patients also had saquinavir mesylate added to their regimen .
This strategy was intended to assess whether higher than approved doses of KALETRA could overcome protease inhibitor cross - resistance .
High doses of KALETRA exhibited a safety profile similar to those observed in previous trials ; changes in HIV - 1 RNA were less than anticipated ; three patients had HIV - 1 RNA < 400 copies / mL at Week 48 .
CD4 + cell count increases were noted in the eight patients who remained on treatment for 48 weeks [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of KALETRA did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , appropriate caution should be exercised in the administration and monitoring of KALETRA in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment KALETRA is principally metabolized by the liver ; therefore , caution should be exercised when administering this drug to patients with hepatic impairment , because lopinavir concentrations may be increased [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdoses with KALETRA oral solution have been reported .
One of these reports described fatal cardiogenic shock in a 2 . 1 kg infant who received a single dose of 6 . 5 mL of KALETRA oral solution nine days prior .
However , a causal relationship between the overdose and the outcome could not be established .
Healthcare professionals should be aware that KALETRA oral solution is highly concentrated and therefore , should pay special attention to accurate calculation of the dose of KALETRA , transcription of the medication order , dispensing information and dosing instructions to minimize the risk for medication errors and overdose .
This is especially important for infants and young children .
KALETRA oral solution contains 42 . 4 % alcohol ( v / v ) .
Accidental ingestion of the product by a young child could result in significant alcohol - related toxicity and could approach the potential lethal dose of alcohol .
Human experience of acute overdosage with KALETRA is limited .
Treatment of overdose with KALETRA should consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient .
There is no specific antidote for overdose with KALETRA .
If indicated , elimination of unabsorbed drug should be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage .
Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid in removal of unabsorbed drug .
Since KALETRA is highly protein bound , dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of the drug .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Lopinavir is an antiviral drug [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic properties of lopinavir co - administered with ritonavir have been evaluated in healthy adult volunteers and in HIV - 1 infected patients ; no substantial differences were observed between the two groups .
Lopinavir is essentially completely metabolized by CYP3A .
Ritonavir inhibits the metabolism of lopinavir , thereby increasing the plasma levels of lopinavir .
Across studies , administration of KALETRA 400 / 100 mg twice daily yields mean steady - state lopinavir plasma concentrations 15 - to 20 - fold higher than those of ritonavir in HIV - 1 infected patients .
The plasma levels of ritonavir are less than 7 % of those obtained after the ritonavir dose of 600 mg twice daily .
The in vitro antiviral EC50 of lopinavir is approximately 10 - fold lower than that of ritonavir .
Therefore , the antiviral activity of KALETRA is due to lopinavir .
Figure 1 displays the mean steady - state plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir after KALETRA 400 / 100 mg twice daily with food for 3 weeks from a pharmacokinetic study in HIV - 1 infected adult subjects ( n = 19 ) .
Figure 1 .
Mean Steady - state Plasma Concentrations with 95 % Confidence Intervals ( CI ) for HIV - 1 Infected Adult Subjects ( N = 19 ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] Absorption In a pharmacokinetic study in HIV - 1 positive subjects ( n = 19 ) , multiple dosing with 400 / 100 mg KALETRA twice daily with food for 3 weeks produced a mean ± SD lopinavir peak plasma concentration ( Cmax ) of 9 . 8 ± 3 . 7 µg / mL , occurring approximately 4 hours after administration .
The mean steady - state trough concentration prior to the morning dose was 7 . 1 ± 2 . 9 µg / mL and minimum concentration within a dosing interval was 5 . 5 ± 2 . 7 µg / mL .
Lopinavir AUC over a 12 hour dosing interval averaged 92 . 6 ± 36 . 7 µg • h / mL .
The absolute bioavailability of lopinavir co - formulated with ritonavir in humans has not been established .
Under nonfasting conditions ( 500 kcal , 25 % from fat ) , lopinavir concentrations were similar following administration of KALETRA co - formulated capsules and oral solution .
When administered under fasting conditions , both the mean AUC and Cmax of lopinavir were 22 % lower for the KALETRA oral solution relative to the capsule formulation .
Plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir after administration of two 200 / 50 mg KALETRA tablets are similar to three 133 . 3 / 33 . 3 mg KALETRA capsules under fed conditions with less pharmacokinetic variability .
Effects of Food on Oral Absorption KALETRA Tablets No clinically significant changes in Cmax and AUC were observed following administration of KALETRA tablets under fed conditions compared to fasted conditions .
Relative to fasting , administration of KALETRA tablets with a moderate fat meal ( 500 - 682 Kcal , 23 to 25 % calories from fat ) increased lopinavir AUC and Cmax by 26 . 9 % and 17 . 6 % , respectively .
Relative to fasting , administration of KALETRA tablets with a high fat meal ( 872 Kcal , 56 % from fat ) increased lopinavir AUC by 18 . 9 % but not Cmax .
Therefore , KALETRA tablets may be taken with or without food .
KALETRA Oral Solution Relative to fasting , administration of KALETRA oral solution with a moderate fat meal ( 500 - 682 Kcal , 23 to 25 % calories from fat ) increased lopinavir AUC and Cmax by 80 and 54 % , respectively .
Relative to fasting , administration of KALETRA oral solution with a high fat meal ( 872 Kcal , 56 % from fat ) increased lopinavir AUC and Cmax by 130 % and 56 % , respectively .
To enhance bioavailability and minimize pharmacokinetic variability KALETRA oral solution should be taken with food .
Distribution At steady state , lopinavir is approximately 98 - 99 % bound to plasma proteins .
Lopinavir binds to both alpha - 1 - acid glycoprotein ( AAG ) and albumin ; however , it has a higher affinity for AAG .
At steady state , lopinavir protein binding remains constant over the range of observed concentrations after 400 / 100 mg KALETRA twice daily , and is similar between healthy volunteers and HIV - 1 positive patients .
Metabolism In vitro experiments with human hepatic microsomes indicate that lopinavir primarily undergoes oxidative metabolism .
Lopinavir is extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system , almost exclusively by the CYP3A isozyme .
Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A inhibitor which inhibits the metabolism of lopinavir , and therefore increases plasma levels of lopinavir .
A 14 C - lopinavir study in humans showed that 89 % of the plasma radioactivity after a single 400 / 100 mg KALETRA dose was due to parent drug .
At least 13 lopinavir oxidative metabolites have been identified in man .
Ritonavir has been shown to induce metabolic enzymes , resulting in the induction of its own metabolism .
Pre - dose lopinavir concentrations decline with time during multiple dosing , stabilizing after approximately 10 to 16 days .
Elimination Following a 400 / 100 mg 14 C - lopinavir / ritonavir dose , approximately 10 . 4 ± 2 . 3 % and 82 . 6 ± 2 . 5 % of an administered dose of 14 C - lopinavir can be accounted for in urine and feces , respectively , after 8 days .
Unchanged lopinavir accounted for approximately 2 . 2 and 19 . 8 % of the administered dose in urine and feces , respectively .
After multiple dosing , less than 3 % of the lopinavir dose is excreted unchanged in the urine .
The apparent oral clearance ( CL / F ) of lopinavir is 5 . 98 ± 5 . 75 L / hr ( mean ± SD , n = 19 ) .
Once Daily Dosing The pharmacokinetics of once daily KALETRA have been evaluated in HIV - 1 infected subjects naïve to antiretroviral treatment .
KALETRA 800 / 200 mg was administered in combination with emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir DF 300 mg as part of a once daily regimen .
Multiple dosing of 800 / 200 mg KALETRA once daily for 4 weeks with food ( n = 24 ) produced a mean ± SD lopinavir peak plasma concentration ( Cmax ) of 11 . 8 ± 3 . 7 µg / mL , occurring approximately 6 hours after administration .
The mean steady - state lopinavir trough concentration prior to the morning dose was 3 . 2 ± 2 . 1 µg / mL and minimum concentration within a dosing interval was 1 . 7 ± 1 . 6 µg / mL .
Lopinavir AUC over a 24 hour dosing interval averaged 154 . 1 ± 61 . 4 µg • h / mL .
Effects on Electrocardiogram QTcF interval was evaluated in a randomized , placebo and active ( moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily ) controlled crossover study in 39 healthy adults , with 10 measurements over 12 hours on Day 3 .
The maximum mean time - matched ( 95 % upper confidence bound ) differences in QTcF interval from placebo after baseline - correction were 5 . 3 ( 8 . 1 ) and 15 . 2 ( 18 . 0 ) mseconds ( msec ) for 400 / 100 mg twice daily and supratherapeutic 800 / 200 mg twice daily KALETRA , respectively .
KALETRA 800 / 200 mg twice daily resulted in a Day 3 mean Cmax approximately 2 - fold higher than the mean Cmax observed with the approved once daily and twice daily KALETRA doses at steady state .
PR interval prolongation was also noted in subjects receiving KALETRA in the same study on Day 3 .
The maximum mean ( 95 % upper confidence bound ) difference from placebo in the PR interval after baseline - correction were 24 . 9 ( 21 . 5 , 28 . 3 ) and 31 . 9 ( 28 . 5 , 35 . 3 ) msec for 400 / 100 mg twice daily and supratherapeutic 800 / 200 mg twice daily KALETRA , respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 , 5 . 6 ) ] .
Special Populations Gender , Race and Age No gender related pharmacokinetic differences have been observed in adult patients .
No clinically important pharmacokinetic differences due to race have been identified .
Lopinavir pharmacokinetics have not been studied in elderly patients .
Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of KALETRA oral solution 300 / 75 mg / m2 twice daily and 230 / 57 . 5 mg / m2 twice daily have been studied in a total of 53 pediatric patients in Study 940 , ranging in age from 6 months to 12 years [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
The 230 / 57 . 5 mg / m2 twice daily regimen without nevirapine and the 300 / 75 mg / m2 twice daily regimen with nevirapine provided lopinavir plasma concentrations similar to those obtained in adult patients receiving the 400 / 100 mg twice daily regimen ( without nevirapine ) .
The mean steady - state lopinavir AUC , Cmax , and Cmin were 72 . 6 ± 31 . 1 µg • h / mL , 8 . 2 ± 2 . 9 and 3 . 4 ± 2 . 1 µg / mL , respectively after KALETRA oral solution 230 / 57 . 5 mg / m2 twice daily without nevirapine ( n = 12 ) , and were 85 . 8 ± 36 . 9 µg • h / mL , 10 . 0 ± 3 . 3 and 3 . 6 ± 3 . 5 µg / mL , respectively , after 300 / 75 mg / m2 twice daily with nevirapine ( n = 12 ) .
The nevirapine regimen was 7 mg / kg twice daily ( 6 months to 8 years ) or 4 mg / kg twice daily ( > 8 years ) .
The pharmacokinetics of KALETRA oral solution at approximately 300 / 75 mg / m2 twice daily have also been evaluated in infants at approximately 6 weeks of age ( n = 9 ) and between 6 weeks and 6 months of age ( n = 18 ) in Study 1030 .
The mean steady - state lopinavir AUC12 , Cmax , and C12 were 43 . 4 ± 14 . 8 µg • h / mL , 5 . 2 ± 1 . 8 µg / mL and 1 . 9 ± 1 . 1 µg / mL , respectively , in infants at approximately 6 weeks of age , and 74 . 5 ± 37 . 9 µg • h / mL , 9 . 4 ± 4 . 9 and 3 . 1 ± 1 . 8 µg / mL , respectively , in infants between 6 weeks and 6 months of age after KALETRA oral solution was administered at approximately 300 / 75 mg / m2 twice daily without concomitant NNRTI therapy .
The pharmacokinetics of KALETRA soft gelatin capsule and oral solution ( Group 1 : 400 / 100 mg / m2 twice daily + 2 NRTIs ; Group 2 : 480 / 120 mg / m2 twice daily + ≥ 1 NRTI + 1 NNRTI ) have been evaluated in children and adolescents age ≥ 2 years to < 18 years of age who had failed prior therapy ( n = 26 ) in Study 1038 .
KALETRA doses of 400 / 100 and 480 / 120 mg / m2 resulted in high lopinavir exposure , as almost all subjects had lopinavir AUC12 above 100 µg • h / mL .
Both groups of subjects also achieved relatively high average minimum lopinavir concentrations .
KALETRA once daily has not been evaluated in pediatric patients .
Renal Impairment Lopinavir pharmacokinetics have not been studied in patients with renal impairment ; however , since the renal clearance of lopinavir is negligible , a decrease in total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment .
Hepatic Impairment Lopinavir is principally metabolized and eliminated by the liver .
Multiple dosing of KALETRA 400 / 100 mg twice daily to HIV - 1 and HCV co - infected patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment ( n = 12 ) resulted in a 30 % increase in lopinavir AUC and 20 % increase in Cmax compared to HIV - 1 infected subjects with normal hepatic function ( n = 12 ) .
Additionally , the plasma protein binding of lopinavir was statistically significantly lower in both mild and moderate hepatic impairment compared to controls ( 99 . 09 vs . 99 . 31 % , respectively ) .
Caution should be exercised when administering KALETRA to subjects with hepatic impairment .
KALETRA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Use In Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Drug Interactions KALETRA is an inhibitor of the P450 isoform CYP3A in vitro .
Co - administration of KALETRA and drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other drug , which could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effects [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
KALETRA does not inhibit CYP2D6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2E1 , CYP2B6 or CYP1A2 at clinically relevant concentrations .
KALETRA has been shown in vivo to induce its own metabolism and to increase the biotransformation of some drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes and by glucuronidation .
KALETRA is metabolized by CYP3A .
Drugs that induce CYP3A activity would be expected to increase the clearance of lopinavir , resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of lopinavir .
Although not noted with concurrent ketoconazole , co - administration of KALETRA and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A may increase lopinavir plasma concentrations .
Drug interaction studies were performed with KALETRA and other drugs likely to be co - administered and some drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interactions .
The effects of co - administration of KALETRA on the AUC , Cmax and Cmin are summarized in Table 10 ( effect of other drugs on lopinavir ) and Table 11 ( effect of KALETRA on other drugs ) .
The effects of other drugs on ritonavir are not shown since they generally correlate with those observed with lopinavir ( if lopinavir concentrations are decreased , ritonavir concentrations are decreased ) unless otherwise indicated in the table footnotes .

Antiviral Activity The antiviral activity of lopinavir against laboratory HIV strains and clinical HIV - 1 isolates was evaluated in acutely infected lymphoblastic cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes , respectively .
In the absence of human serum , the mean 50 % effective concentration ( EC50 ) values of lopinavir against five different HIV - 1 subtype B laboratory strains ranged from 10 - 27 nM ( 0 . 006 - 0 . 017 µg / mL , 1 µg / mL = 1 . 6 µM ) and ranged from 4 - 11 nM ( 0 . 003 - 0 . 007 µg / mL ) against several HIV - 1 subtype B clinical isolates ( n = 6 ) .
In the presence of 50 % human serum , the mean EC50 values of lopinavir against these five HIV - 1 laboratory strains ranged from 65 - 289 nM ( 0 . 04 - 0 . 18 µg / mL ) , representing a 7 - to 11 - fold attenuation .
Combination antiviral drug activity studies with lopinavir in cell cultures demonstrated additive to antagonistic activity with nelfinavir and additive to synergistic activity with amprenavir , atazanavir , indinavir , saquinavir and tipranavir .
The EC50 values of lopinavir against three different HIV - 2 strains ranged from 12 - 180 nM ( 0 . 008 - 113 μg / mL ) .
Resistance HIV - 1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to lopinavir have been selected in cell culture .
The presence of ritonavir does not appear to influence the selection of lopinavir - resistant viruses in cell culture .
The selection of resistance to KALETRA in antiretroviral treatment naïve patients has not yet been characterized .
In a study of 653 antiretroviral treatment naïve patients ( Study 863 ) , plasma viral isolates from each patient on treatment with plasma HIV - 1 RNA > 400 copies / mL at Week 24 , 32 , 40 and / or 48 were analyzed .
No evidence of resistance to KALETRA was observed in 37 evaluable KALETRA - treated patients ( 0 % ) .
Evidence of genotypic resistance to nelfinavir , defined as the presence of the D30N and / or L90M substitution in HIV - 1 protease , was observed in 25 / 76 ( 33 % ) of evaluable nelfinavir - treated patients .
The selection of resistance to KALETRA in antiretroviral treatment naïve pediatric patients ( Study 940 ) appears to be consistent with that seen in adult patients ( Study 863 ) .
Resistance to KALETRA has been noted to emerge in patients treated with other protease inhibitors prior to KALETRA therapy .
In studies of 227 antiretroviral treatment naïve and protease inhibitor experienced patients , isolates from 4 of 23 patients with quantifiable ( > 400 copies / mL ) viral RNA following treatment with KALETRA for 12 to 100 weeks displayed significantly reduced susceptibility to lopinavir compared to the corresponding baseline viral isolates .
Three of these patients had previously received treatment with a single protease inhibitor ( indinavir , nelfinavir , or saquinavir ) and one patient had received treatment with multiple protease inhibitors ( indinavir , ritonavir , and saquinavir ) .
All four of these patients had at least 4 substitutions associated with protease inhibitor resistance immediately prior to KALETRA therapy .
Following viral rebound , isolates from these patients all contained additional substitutions , some of which are recognized to be associated with protease inhibitor resistance .
However , there are insufficient data at this time to identify patterns of lopinavir - associated substitutions in isolates from patients on KALETRA therapy .
The assessment of these patterns is under study .
Cross - resistance - Preclinical Studies Varying degrees of cross - resistance have been observed among HIV - 1 protease inhibitors .
Little information is available on the cross - resistance of viruses that developed decreased susceptibility to lopinavir during KALETRA therapy .
The antiviral activity in cell culture of lopinavir against clinical isolates from patients previously treated with a single protease inhibitor was determined .
Isolates that displayed > 4 - fold reduced susceptibility to nelfinavir ( n = 13 ) and saquinavir ( n = 4 ) , displayed < 4 - fold reduced susceptibility to lopinavir .
Isolates with > 4 - fold reduced susceptibility to indinavir ( n = 16 ) and ritonavir ( n = 3 ) displayed a mean of 5 . 7 - and 8 . 3 - fold reduced susceptibility to lopinavir , respectively .
Isolates from patients previously treated with two or more protease inhibitors showed greater reductions in susceptibility to lopinavir , as described in the following paragraph .
Clinical Studies - Antiviral Activity of KALETRA in Patients with Previous Protease Inhibitor Therapies The clinical relevance of reduced susceptibility in cell culture to lopinavir has been examined by assessing the virologic response to KALETRA therapy in treatment - experienced patients , with respect to baseline viral genotype in three studies and baseline viral phenotype in one study .
Virologic response to KALETRA has been shown to be affected by the presence of three or more of the following amino acid substitutions in protease at baseline : L10F / I / R / V , K20M / N / R , L24I , L33F , M36I , I47V , G48V , I54L / T / V , V82A / C / F / S / T , and I84V .
Table 12 shows the 48 - week virologic response ( HIV - 1 RNA < 400 copies / mL ) according to the number of the above protease inhibitor resistance mutations at baseline in studies 888 and 765 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) and ( 14 . 3 ) ] and study 957 ( see below ) .

In this study 56 NNRTI - naïve patients with HIV - 1 RNA > 1 , 000 copies / mL despite previous therapy with at least two protease inhibitors selected from indinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , and saquinavir were randomized to receive one of two doses of KALETRA in combination with efavirenz and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) .
The EC50 values of lopinavir against the 56 baseline viral isolates ranged from 0 . 5 - to 96 - fold the wild - type EC50 value .
Fifty - five percent ( 31 / 56 ) of these baseline isolates displayed > 4 - fold reduced susceptibility to lopinavir .
These 31 isolates had a median reduction in lopinavir susceptibility of 18 - fold .
Response to therapy by baseline lopinavir susceptibility is shown in Table 13 .

Results showed an increase in the incidence of benign hepatocellular adenomas and an increase in the combined incidence of hepatocellular adenomas plus carcinoma in both males and females in mice and males in rats at doses that produced approximately 1 . 6 - 2 . 2 times ( mice ) and 0 . 5 times ( rats ) the human exposure ( based on AUC0 - 24 hr measurement ) at the recommended dose of 400 / 100 mg KALETRA twice daily .
Administration of lopinavir / ritonavir did not cause a statistically significant increase in the incidence of any other benign or malignant neoplasm in mice or rats .
Carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats have been carried out on ritonavir .
In male mice , there was a dose dependent increase in the incidence of both adenomas and combined adenomas and carcinomas in the liver .
Based on AUC measurements , the exposure at the high dose was approximately 4 - fold for males that of the exposure in humans with the recommended therapeutic dose ( 400 / 100 mg KALETRA twice daily ) .
There were no carcinogenic effects seen in females at the dosages tested .
The exposure at the high dose was approximately 9 - fold for the females that of the exposure in humans .
There were no carcinogenic effects in rats .
In this study , the exposure at the high dose was approximately 0 . 7 - fold that of the exposure in humans with the 400 / 100 mg KALETRA twice daily regimen .
Based on the exposures achieved in the animal studies , the significance of the observed effects is not known .
However , neither lopinavir nor ritonavir was found to be mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay using S . typhimurium and E . coli , the mouse lymphoma assay , the mouse micronucleus test and chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes .
Lopinavir in combination with ritonavir at a 2 : 1 ratio produced no effects on fertility in male and female rats at levels of 10 / 5 , 30 / 15 or 100 / 50 mg / kg / day .
Based on AUC measurements , the exposures in rats at the high doses were approximately 0 . 7 - fold for lopinavir and 1 . 8 - fold for ritonavir of the exposures in humans at the recommended therapeutic dose ( 400 / 100 mg twice daily ) .

Study 940 was an open - label , multicenter trial evaluating the pharmacokinetic profile , tolerability , safety and efficacy of KALETRA oral solution containing lopinavir 80 mg / mL and ritonavir 20 mg / mL in 100 antiretroviral naïve ( 44 % ) and experienced ( 56 % ) pediatric patients .
All patients were non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor naïve .
Patients were randomized to either 230 mg lopinavir / 57 . 5 mg ritonavir per m2 or 300 mg lopinavir / 75 mg ritonavir per m2 .
Naïve patients also received lamivudine and stavudine .
Experienced patients received nevirapine plus up to two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors .
Safety , efficacy and pharmacokinetic profiles of the two dose regimens were assessed after three weeks of therapy in each patient .
After analysis of these data , all patients were continued on the 300 mg lopinavir / 75 mg ritonavir per m2 dose .
Patients had a mean age of 5 years ( range 6 months to 12 years ) with 14 % less than 2 years .
Mean baseline CD4 + cell count was 838 cells / mm3 and mean baseline plasma HIV - 1 RNA was 4 . 7 log10 copies / mL .
Through 48 weeks of therapy , the proportion of patients who achieved and sustained an HIV - 1 RNA < 400 copies / mL was 80 % for antiretroviral naïve patients and 71 % for antiretroviral experienced patients .
The mean increase from baseline in CD4 + cell count was 404 cells / mm3 for antiretroviral naïve and 284 cells / mm3 for antiretroviral experienced patients treated through 48 weeks .
At 48 weeks , two patients ( 2 % ) had prematurely discontinued the study .
One antiretroviral naïve patient prematurely discontinued secondary to an adverse reaction , while one antiretroviral experienced patient prematurely discontinued secondary to an HIV - 1 related event .
Dose selection in pediatric patients was based on the following : • Among patients 14 days to 6 months of age receiving 300 / 75 mg / m2 twice daily without nevirapine , plasma concentrations were lower than those observed in adults or in older children .
This dose resulted in HIV - 1 RNA < 400 copies / mL in 55 % of patients ( 70 % in those initiating treatment at < 6 weeks of age ) .
• Among patients 6 months to 12 years of age , the 230 / 57 . 5 mg / m2 oral solution twice daily regimen without nevirapine and the 300 / 75 mg / m2 oral solution twice daily regimen with nevirapine provided lopinavir plasma concentrations similar to those obtained in adult patients receiving the 400 / 100 mg twice daily regimen ( without nevirapine ) .
These doses resulted in treatment benefit ( proportion of patients with HIV - 1 RNA < 400 copies / mL ) similar to that seen in the adult clinical trials .
• Among patients 12 to 18 years of age receiving 400 / 100 mg / m2 or 480 / 120 mg / m2 ( with efavirenz ) twice daily , plasma concentrations were 60 - 100 % higher than among 6 to 12 year old patients receiving 230 / 57 . 5 mg / m2 .
Mean apparent clearance was similar to that observed in adult patients receiving standard dose and in patients 6 to 12 years of age .
Although changes in HIV - 1 RNA in patients with prior treatment failure were less than anticipated , the pharmacokinetic data supports use of similar dosing as in patients 6 to 12 years of age , not to exceed the recommended adult dose .
• For all age groups , the body surface area dosing was converted to body weight dosing using the actual patient dose .
