7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic - based drug - drug interaction studies have been conducted with LUPRON DEPOT - PED [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Drug - Laboratory Test Interactions Administration of LUPRON DEPOT - PED in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary - gonadal system .
Therefore , diagnostic tests of pituitary gonadotropic and gonadal functions conducted during treatment and up to six months after discontinuation of LUPRON DEPOT - PED may be affected .
Normal pituitary - gonadal function is usually restored within six months after treatment with LUPRON DEPOT - PED is discontinued .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary LUPRON DEPOT - PED is contraindicated in pregnancy [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
LUPRON DEPOT - PED may cause fetal harm , when administered to a pregnant woman , based on findings from animal studies and the drug ’ s mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
The available data from published clinical studies and case reports and from the pharmacovigilance database on exposure to LUPRON DEPOT - PED during pregnancy are insufficient to assess the risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Based on animal reproduction studies , LUPRON DEPOT - PED may be associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications , including early pregnancy loss and fetal harm .
In animal reproduction studies , subcutaneous administration of leuprolide acetate to rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused embryo - fetal toxicity , decreased fetal weights and a dose - dependent increase in major fetal abnormalities in animals at doses less than the recommended human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose .
A similar rat study also showed increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights but no major fetal abnormalities at doses less than the recommended human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the US general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % - 4 % and 15 % - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data When administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 0 . 00024 mg / kg , 0 . 0024 mg / kg , and 0 . 024 mg / kg ( doses less than the recommended human dose ) to rabbits , leuprolide acetate produced a dose - related increase in malformations comprised primarily of segmental and fusion defects of the skeleton and skull .
Similar studies in rats failed to demonstrate an increase in fetal malformations .
There was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of leuprolide acetate in rabbits and with the highest dose ( 0 . 024 mg / kg ) in rats .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of leuprolide acetate in either animal or human milk , the effects on the breastfed infants , or the effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for LUPRON DEPOT - PED and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from LUPRON DEPOT - PED or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Exclude pregnancy in women of reproductive potential prior to initiating LUPRON DEPOT - PED if clinically indicated [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception Females LUPRON DEPOT - PED may cause embryo - fetal harm when administered during pregnancy .
LUPRON DEPOT - PED is not a contraceptive .
If contraception is indicated , advise females of reproductive potential to use a non - hormonal method of contraception during treatment with LUPRON DEPOT - PED [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Based on its pharmacodynamic effects of decreasing secretion of gonadal steroids , fertility is expected to be decreased while on treatment with LUPRON DEPOT - PED .
Clinical and pharmacologic studies in adults ( > 18 years ) with leuprolide acetate and similar analogs have shown reversibility of fertility suppression when the drug is discontinued after continuous administration for periods of up to 24 weeks [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
There is no evidence that pregnancy rates are affected following discontinuation of LUPRON DEPOT - PED .
Animal studies ( prepubertal and adult rats and monkeys ) with leuprolide acetate and other GnRH analogs have shown functional recovery of fertility suppression .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of LUPRON DEPOT - PED for the treatment of CPP has been established in pediatric patients 1 years of age and older .
Use of LUPRON DEPOT - PED for this indication is supported by evidence from two pivotal , open label clinical studies of 139 pediatric patients with central precocious puberty with an age range of 1 to 11 years [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of LUPRON DEPOT - PED have not been established in pediatric patients less than 1 year old .
10 OVERDOSAGE No specific antidotes for LUPRON DEPOT - PED are known .
Contact Poison Control ( 1 - 800 - 222 - 1222 ) for latest recommendations .
In cases of overdosage , standard of care monitoring and management principles should be followed .
11 DESCRIPTION LUPRON DEPOT - PED contains active ingredient , leuprolide , in the form of acetate salt , a gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) agonist .
It is a synthetic nonapeptide analog of naturally occurring gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH or LH - RH ) .
The analog possesses greater potency than the natural hormone .
The chemical name of leuprolide acetate is 5 - oxo - L - prolyl - L - histidyl - L - tryptophyl - L - seryl - L - tyrosyl - D - leucyl - L - leucyl - L - arginyl - N - ethyl - L - prolinamide acetate , which has molecular formula of C59H84N16O12 .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Leuprolide acetate , a GnRH agonist , acts as a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion ( LH and follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) ) when given continuously in therapeutic doses .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Following an initial stimulation of GnRH receptors , chronic administration of leuprolide acetate results in downregulation of GnRH receptors , reduction in release of LH and FSH , and consequent suppression of ovarian and testicular production of estradiol and testosterone , respectively .
This inhibitory effect is reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption LUPRON DEPOT - PED for 1 - month administration Following a single LUPRON DEPOT - PED 7 . 5 mg for 1 - month administration to adult patients , mean peak leuprolide plasma concentration was almost 20 ng / mL at 4 hours and then declined to 0 . 36 ng / mL at 4 weeks .
However , intact leuprolide and an inactive major metabolite could not be distinguished by the assay which was employed in the study .
Nondetectable leuprolide plasma concentrations have been observed during chronic LUPRON DEPOT - PED 7 . 5 mg administration , but testosterone levels appear to be maintained at castrate levels .
In a study of pediatric patients with CPP , doses of 7 . 5 mg , 11 . 25 mg and 15 . 0 mg of LUPRON DEPOT - PED were given every 4 weeks .
In 22 pediatric patients , trough leuprolide plasma levels were determined according to weight categories as summarized below : Patient Weight Range ( kg ) Group Weight Average ( kg ) Dose ( mg ) Trough Plasma Leuprolide Level Mean ± SD ( ng / mL ) * 20 . 2 - 27 . 0 22 . 7 7 . 5 0 . 77 ± 0 . 033 28 . 4 - 36 . 8 32 . 5 11 . 25 1 . 25 ± 1 . 06 39 . 3 - 57 . 5 44 . 2 15 . 0 1 . 59 ± 0 . 65 * Group average values determined at Week 4 immediately prior to leuprolide injection .
Drug levels at 12 and 24 weeks were similar to respective 4 week levels .
LUPRON DEPOT - PED for 3 - month administration Following a single LUPRON DEPOT - PED 11 . 25 mg or 30 mg for 3 - month administration to pediatric patients with CPP , leuprolide concentrations increased with increasing dose with mean peak leuprolide plasma concentration of 19 . 1 and 52 . 5 ng / mL at 1 hour for the 11 . 25 and 30 mg dose levels , respectively .
The concentrations then declined to 0 . 08 and 0 . 25 ng / mL at 2 weeks after dosing for the 11 . 25 and 30 mg dose levels .
Mean leuprolide plasma concentration remained constant from month 1 to month 3 for both 11 . 25 and 30 mg doses .
The mean leuprolide concentrations 3 months after the first and second injections were similar indicating no accumulation of leuprolide from repeated administration .
Distribution The mean steady - state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male subjects was 27 L .
In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43 % to 49 % .
Elimination Metabolism In healthy male subjects given an intravenous 1 mg bolus of leuprolide the mean systemic clearance was 7 . 6 L / h , with a terminal elimination half - life of approximately 3 hours based on a two - compartment model .
In rats and dogs , administration of 14 C - labeled leuprolide was shown to be metabolized to smaller inactive peptides ; a pentapeptide ( Metabolite I ) , tripeptides ( Metabolites II and III ) and a dipeptide ( Metabolite IV ) .
These fragments may be further catabolized .
The major metabolite ( M - I ) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6 % of the peak parent drug concentration .
One week after dosing , mean plasma M - I concentrations were approximately 20 % of mean leuprolide concentrations .
Excretion Following administration of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg to 3 patients , less than 5 % of the dose was recovered as parent and M - I metabolite in the urine .
Specific Populations The pharmacokinetics of LUPRON DEPOT - PED has not been determined in patients with hepatic or renal impairment .
Drug - Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic - based drug - drug interaction studies have been conducted with LUPRON DEPOT - PED .
Leuprolide acetate is a peptide that is not degraded by cytochrome P - 450 enzymes ; hence , drug interactions associated with cytochrome P - 450 enzymes would not be expected to occur .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility A two - year carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats and mice .
In rats , a dose - related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses ( 0 . 6 to 4 mg / kg ) .
There was a significant but not dose - related increase of pancreatic islet - cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males ( highest incidence in the low dose group ) .
In mice , no leuprolide acetate - induced tumors or pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg / kg for two years .
Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems .
These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 1 LUPRON DEPOT - PED for 1 - month administration The efficacy of LUPRON DEPOT - PED was evaluated in a pivotal open - label , multicenter clinical trial in which 55 pediatric patients with central precocious puberty ( 49 females and 6 males , naïve to previous GnRHa treatment ) were treated with LUPRON DEPOT - PED 1 - month formulations until age was appropriate for entry into puberty ( see treatment period data below ) and a subset of 40 subjects were then followed post - treatment ( see follow - up period data below ) .
The mean ± SD age at the start of treatment was 7 ± 2 years and the duration of treatment was 4 ± 2 years .
Study drug was administered intramuscularly ( IM ) every 28 days , with incremental adjustments of 3 . 75 mg at each clinic visit , if necessary based on clinical and laboratory results .
During the follow - up period , GnRHa stimulation test was performed every 6 months until a pubertal response was observed .
During the treatment period , LUPRON DEPOT - PED suppressed gonadotropins and sex steroids to prepubertal levels .
Suppression of peak stimulated LH concentrations to < 1 . 75 mIU / mL was achieved in 96 % of subjects by month 1 .
Five subjects required increased doses of study drug to achieve or retain LH suppression .
The number and percentage of subjects with suppression of peak stimulated LH < 1 . 75 mIU / mL and mean ± SD peak stimulated LH over time is shown in Table 4 .
Six months after the treatment period was finished , the mean peak stimulated LH was 20 . 6 ± SD 13 . 7 mIU / mL ( n = 30 ) .
The following effects have been noted with the chronic administration of leuprolide : cessation of menses ( in girls ) , normalization and stabilization of linear growth and bone age advancement , stabilization of clinical signs and symptoms of puberty .

In females , suppression of breast development ranged from 66 . 7 to 90 . 6 % of subjects during the first 5 years of treatment .
The mean stimulated estradiol was 15 . 1 pg / mL at baseline , decreased to the lower level of detection ( 5 . 0 pg / mL ) by Week 4 and was maintained there during the first 5 years of treatment .
In males , suppression of genitalia development ranged from 60 % to 100 % of subjects during the first 5 years of treatment .
The mean stimulated testosterone was 347 . 7 ng / dL at baseline and was maintained at levels no greater than 25 . 3 ng / dL during the first 5 years of treatment .
A “ flare effect ” of transient bleeding or spotting during the first 4 weeks of treatment was observed in 19 . 4 % ( 7 / 36 ) females who had not reached menarche at baseline .
After the first 4 weeks and for the remainder of the treatment period , no subject reported menstrual - like bleeding , and only rare spotting was noted .
The mean ratio of bone age to chronological age decreased from 1 . 5 at baseline to 1 . 1 by end of treatment .
The mean height standard deviation z - score changed from 1 . 6 at baseline to 0 . 7 at the end of the treatment phase .
Thirty five ( 35 ) females and 5 males participated in a post - treatment follow - up period to assess reproductive function ( in females ) and final height .
At 6 months post - treatment , most patients reverted to pubertal levels of LH ( 87 . 9 % ) and clinical signs of resumption of pubertal progression were evident with increase in breast development in girls ( 66 . 7 % ) and increase in genitalia development in boys ( 80 % ) .
After stopping treatment , regular menses were reported for all female subjects who reached 12 years of age during follow - up ; mean time to menses was approximately 1 . 5 years ; mean age of onset of menstruation after stopping treatment was 12 . 9 years .
Of the 40 patients evaluated in the follow - up , 33 were observed until they reached final or near - final adult height .
These patients had a mean increase in final adult height compared to baseline predicted adult height .
The mean final adult height standard deviation score was - 0 . 2 .
14 . 2 LUPRON DEPOT - PED for 3 - month administration The efficacy was evaluated in a 6 - month , randomized , open - label clinical study of LUPRON DEPOT - PED 3 - Month formulations .
84 subjects ( 76 female , 8 male ) between 1 and 11 years of age received the LUPRON DEPOT - PED 11 . 25 mg or 30 mg for 3 - month administration formulation .
Each dose group had an equal number of treatment - naïve patients who had pubertal LH levels and patients previously treated with GnRHa therapies who had prepubertal LH levels at the time of study entry .
The percentage of subjects with suppression of peak - stimulated LH to < 4 . 0 mIU / mL , as determined by assessments at months 2 , 3 and 6 , is 78 . 6 % in the 11 . 25 mg dose and 95 . 2 % in the 30 mg dose as shown in Table 5 .
