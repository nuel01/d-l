[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Chlorzoxazone is a centrally - acting agent for painful musculoskeletal conditions .
Data available from animal experiments as well as human study indicate that chlorzoxazone acts primarily at the level of the spinal cord and subcortical areas of the brain where it inhibits multisynaptic reflex arcs involved in producing and maintaining skeletal muscle spasm of varied etiology .
The clinical result is a reduction of the skeletal muscle spasm with relief of pain and increased mobility of the involved muscles .
Blood levels of chlorzoxazone can be detected in people during the first 30 minutes and peak levels may be reached , in the majority of the subjects , in about 1 to 2 hours after oral administration of chlorzoxazone .
Chlorzoxazone is rapidly metabolized and is excreted in the urine , primarily in a conjugated form as the glucuronide .
Less than one percent of a dose of chlorzoxazone is excreted unchanged in the urine in 24 hours INDICATIONS AND USAGE Chlorzoxazone is indicated as an adjunct to rest , physical therapy , and other measures for the relief of discomfort associated with acute , painful musculoskeletal conditions .
The mode of action of this drug has not been clearly identified but may be related to its sedative properties .
