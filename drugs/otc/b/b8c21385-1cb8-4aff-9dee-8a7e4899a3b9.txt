8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Ganciclovir has been shown to be embryotoxic in rabbits and mice following intravenous administration and teratogenic in rabbits .
Fetal resorptions were present in at least 85 % of rabbits and mice administered 60 mg / kg / day and 108 mg / kg / day ( approximately 10 , 000 x and 17 , 000 x the human ocular dose of 6 . 25 mcg / kg / day ) , respectively , assuming complete absorption .
Effects observed in rabbits included : fetal growth retardation , embryolethality , teratogenicity , and / or maternal toxicity .
Teratogenic changes included cleft palate , anophthalmia / microphthalmia , aplastic organs ( kidney and pancreas ) , hydrocephaly , and brachygnathia .
In mice , effects observed were maternal / fetal toxicity and embryolethality .
Daily intravenous doses of 90 mg / kg / day ( 14 , 000 x the human ocular dose ) administered to female mice prior to mating , during gestation , and during lactation caused hypoplasia of the testes and seminal vesicles in the month - old male offspring , as well as pathologic changes in the nonglandular region of the stomach [ see Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
ZIRGAN should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether topical ophthalmic ganciclovir administration could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk .
Caution should be exercised when ZIRGAN is administered to nursing mothers .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients below the age of 2 years have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients .
11 DESCRIPTION ZIRGAN ( ganciclovir ophthalmic gel ) 0 . 15 % contains a sterile , topical antiviral for ophthalmic use .
The chemical name is 9 - [ [ 2 - hydroxy - 1 - ( hydroxymethyl ) ethoxy ] methyl ] guanine ( CAS number 82410 - 32 - 0 ) .
Ganciclovir is represented by the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Ganciclovir has a molecular weight of 255 . 23 , and the empirical formula is C9H13N5O4 .
Each gram of gel contains : ACTIVE : ganciclovir 1 . 5 mg ( 0 . 15 % ) .
INACTIVES : carbomer homopolymer , water for injection , sodium hydroxide ( to adjust the pH to 7 . 2 - 7 . 6 ) , mannitol .
PRESERVATIVE : benzalkonium chloride 0 . 075 mg ( 0 . 0075 % ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action ZIRGAN contains the active ingredient , ganciclovir , which is a guanosine derivative that , upon phosphorylation , inhibits DNA replication by herpes simplex viruses ( HSV ) .
Ganciclovir is transformed by viral and cellular thymidine kinases ( TK ) to ganciclovir triphosphate , which works as an antiviral agent by inhibiting the synthesis of viral DNA in 2 ways : competitive inhibition of viral DNA - polymerase and direct incorporation into viral primer strand DNA , resulting in DNA chain termination and prevention of replication .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The estimated maximum daily dose of ganciclovir administered as 1 drop , 5 times per day is 0 . 375 mg .
Compared to maintenance doses of systemically administered ganciclovir of 900 mg ( oral valganciclovir ) and 5 mg / kg ( IV ganciclovir ) , the ophthalmically administered daily dose is approximately 0 . 04 % and 0 . 1 % of the oral dose and IV doses , respectively , thus minimal systemic exposure is expected .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Ganciclovir was carcinogenic in the mouse at oral doses of 20 and 1 , 000 mg / kg / day ( approximately 3 , 000 x and 160 , 000 x the human ocular dose of 6 . 25 mcg / kg / day , assuming complete absorption ) .
At the dose of 1 , 000 mg / kg / day , there was a significant increase in the incidence of tumors of the preputial gland in males , forestomach ( nonglandular mucosa ) in males and females , and reproductive tissues ( ovaries , uterus , mammary gland , clitoral gland , and vagina ) and liver in females .
At the dose of 20 mg / kg / day , a slightly increased incidence of tumors was noted in the preputial and harderian glands in males , forestomach in males and females , and liver in females .
No carcinogenic effect was observed in mice administered ganciclovir at 1 mg / kg / day ( 160 x the human ocular dose ) .
Except for histocytic sarcoma of the liver , ganciclovir - induced tumors were generally of epithelial or vascular origin .
Although the preputial and clitoral glands , forestomach and harderian glands of mice do not have human counterparts , ganciclovir should be considered a potential carcinogen in humans .
Ganciclovir increased mutations in mouse lymphoma cells and DNA damage in human lymphocytes in vitro at concentrations between 50 to 500 and 250 to 2 , 000 mcg / mL , respectively .
In the mouse micronucleus assay , ganciclovir was clastogenic at doses of 150 and 500 mg / kg ( IV ) ( 24 , 000 x to 80 , 000 x human ocular dose ) but not 50 mg / kg ( 8 , 000 x human ocular dose ) .
Ganciclovir was not mutagenic in the Ames Salmonella assay at concentrations of 500 to 5 , 000 mcg / mL .
Ganciclovir caused decreased mating behavior , decreased fertility , and an increased incidence of embryolethality in female mice following intravenous doses of 90 mg / kg / day ( approximately 14 , 000 x the human ocular dose of 6 . 25 mcg / kg / day ) .
Ganciclovir caused decreased fertility in male mice and hypospermatogenesis in mice and dogs following daily oral or intravenous administration of doses ranging from 0 . 2 to 10 mg / kg ( 30 x to 1 , 600 x the human ocular dose ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES In one open - label , randomized , controlled , multicenter clinical trial which enrolled 164 patients with herpetic keratitis , ZIRGAN was non - inferior to acyclovir ophthalmic ointment , 3 % in patients with dendritic ulcers .
Clinical resolution ( healed ulcers ) at Day 7 was achieved in 77 % ( 55 / 71 ) for ZIRGAN versus 72 % ( 48 / 67 ) for acyclovir 3 % ( difference 5 . 8 % , 95 % CI - 9 . 6 % - 18 . 3 % ) .
In three randomized , single - masked , controlled , multicenter clinical trials which enrolled 213 total patients , ZIRGAN was noninferior to acyclovir ophthalmic ointment 3 % in patients with dendritic ulcers .
Clinical resolution at Day 7 was achieved in 72 % ( 41 / 57 ) for ZIRGAN versus 69 % ( 34 / 49 ) for acyclovir ( difference 2 . 5 % , 95 % CI - 15 . 6 % - 20 . 9 % ) .
