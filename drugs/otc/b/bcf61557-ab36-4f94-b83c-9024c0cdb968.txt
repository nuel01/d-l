( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS PIFELTRO is contraindicated when co - administered with drugs that are strong cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3 A enzyme inducers as significant decreases in doravirine plasma concentrations may occur , which may decrease the effectiveness of PIFELTRO [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
These drugs include , but are not limited to , the following : • the anticonvulsants carbamazepine , oxcarbazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin • the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide • the antimycobacterials rifampin , rifapentine • the cytotoxic agent mitotane • St . John ' s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) • PIFELTRO is contraindicated when co - administered with drugs that are strong cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3 A enzyme inducers as significant decreases in doravirine plasma concentrations may occur , which may decrease the effectiveness of PIFELTRO .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Monitor for Immune Reconstitution Syndrome .
( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions The concomitant use of PIFELTRO and certain other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions , some of which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of PIFELTRO and possible development of resistance [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
See Table 6 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions , including dosing recommendations .
Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during PIFELTRO therapy , review concomitant medications during PIFELTRO therapy , and monitor for adverse reactions .
5 . 2 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia ( PCP ) , or tuberculosis ) , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
Autoimmune disorders ( such as Graves ' disease , polymyositis , Guillain - Barré syndrome , and autoimmune hepatitis ) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution ; however , the time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling : • Immune Reconstitution Syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( incidence greater than or equal to 5 % , all grades ) are nausea , dizziness , headache , fatigue , diarrhea , abdominal pain , and abnormal dreams .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Adverse Reactions in Adults with No Antiretroviral Treatment History The safety assessment of PIFELTRO used in combination with other antiretroviral agents is based on Week 96 data from two Phase 3 , randomized , international , multicenter , double - blind , active - controlled trials ( DRIVE - FORWARD ( Protocol 018 ) and DRIVE - AHEAD ( Protocol 021 ) ) .
In DRIVE - FORWARD , 766 adult subjects received either PIFELTRO 100 mg ( n = 383 ) or darunavir 800 mg + ritonavir 100 mg ( DRV + r ) ( n = 383 ) once daily , each in combination with emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( FTC / TDF ) or abacavir / lamivudine ( ABC / 3 TC ) .
By Week 96 , 2 % in the PIFELTRO group and 3 % in the DRV + r group had adverse events leading to discontinuation of study medication .
In DRIVE - AHEAD , 728 adult subjects received either DELSTRIGO [ doravirine ( DOR ) / 3 TC / TDF ] ( n = 364 ) or efavirenz ( EFV ) / FTC / TDF once daily ( n = 364 ) .
By Week 96 , 3 % in the DELSTRIGO group and 7 % in the EFV / FTC / TDF group had adverse events leading to discontinuation of study medication .

[ 4 ] Predefined using MedDRA preferred terms , including : altered state of consciousness , lethargy , somnolence , syncope .
Neuropsychiatric adverse events in the pre - defined category of depression and suicide / self - injury were reported in 4 % and 7 % of subjects , in the DELSTRIGO and EFV / FTC / TDF groups , respectively .
In DRIVE - AHEAD through 48 weeks of treatment , the majority of subjects who reported neuropsychiatric adverse events reported events that were mild to moderate in severity ( 97 % [ 83 / 86 ] and 96 % [ 198 / 207 ] , in the DELSTRIGO and EFV / FTC / TDF groups , respectively ) and the majority of subjects reported these events in the first 4 weeks of treatment ( 72 % [ 62 / 86 ] in the DELSTRIGO group and 86 % [ 177 / 207 ] in the EFV / FTC / TDF group ) .
Neuropsychiatric adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 1 % ( 2 / 364 ) and 1 % ( 5 / 364 ) of subjects in the DELSTRIGO and EFV / FTC / TDF groups , respectively .
The proportion of subjects who reported neuropsychiatric adverse events through Week 4 was 17 % ( 62 / 364 ) in the DELSTRIGO group and 49 % ( 177 / 364 ) in the EFV / FTC / TDF group .
At Week 48 , the prevalence of neuropsychiatric adverse events was 12 % ( 44 / 364 ) in the DELSTRIGO group and 22 % ( 81 / 364 ) in the EFV / FTC / TDF group .
At Week 96 , the prevalence of neuropsychiatric adverse events was 13 % ( 47 / 364 ) in the DELSTRIGO group and 23 % ( 82 / 364 ) in the EFV / FTC / TDF group .
Laboratory Abnormalities The percentages of subjects with selected laboratory abnormalities ( that represent a worsening from baseline ) who were treated with PIFELTRO or DRV + r in DRIVE - FORWARD , or DELSTRIGO or EFV / FTC / TDF in DRIVE - AHEAD are presented in Table 3 .

Adverse Reactions in Virologically - Suppressed Adults The safety of DELSTRIGO in virologically - suppressed adults was based on Week 48 data from 670 subjects in the DRIVE - SHIFT trial ( Protocol 024 ) , a randomized , international , multicenter , open - label trial in which virologically - suppressed subjects were switched from a baseline regimen consisting of two NRTIs in combination with a protease inhibitor ( PI ) plus either ritonavir or cobicistat , or elvitegravir plus cobicistat , or a non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) to DELSTRIGO .
Overall , the safety profile in virologically - suppressed adult subjects was similar to that in subjects with no antiretroviral treatment history .
Laboratory Abnormalities Serum ALT and AST Elevations : In the DRIVE - SHIFT trial , 22 % and 16 % of subjects in the immediate switch group experienced ALT and AST elevations greater than 1 . 25 × ULN , respectively , through 48 weeks on DELSTRIGO .
For these ALT and AST elevations , no apparent patterns with regard to time to onset relative to switch were observed .
One percent of subjects had ALT or AST elevations greater than 5 × ULN through 48 weeks on DELSTRIGO .
The ALT and AST elevations were generally asymptomatic and not associated with bilirubin elevations .
In comparison , 4 % and 4 % of subjects in the delayed switch group experienced ALT and AST elevations of greater than 1 . 25 × ULN through 24 weeks on their baseline regimen .
Change in Lipids from Baseline Changes from baseline at Week 24 in LDL - cholesterol , non - HDL - cholesterol , total cholesterol , triglycerides , and HDL - cholesterol in subjects on a PI plus ritonavir - based regimen at baseline are shown in Table 5 .
The LDL and non - HDL comparisons were pre - specified , and the differences were statistically significant , showing superiority for an immediate switch to DELSTRIGO for both parameters .
The clinical benefit of these findings has not been demonstrated .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Breastfeeding is not recommended due to the potential for HIV - 1 transmission .
( 8 . 2 ) • Pediatrics : Not recommended for patients weighing less than 35 kg .
( 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to PIFELTRO during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry ( APR ) at 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
Risk Summary No adequate human data are available to establish whether or not PIFELTRO poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , no adverse developmental effects were observed when doravirine was administered at exposures ≥ 8 times the exposure in humans at the recommended human dose ( RHD ) of PIFELTRO ( see Data ) .
The background rate of major birth defects is 2 . 7 % in a U . S . reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program ( MACDP ) .
The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR .
The estimated background rate of miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies in the U . S . general population is 15 - 20 % .
Methodological limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group .
The MACDP population is not disease - specific , evaluates individuals and infants from the limited geographic area , and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at less than 20 weeks gestation .
Data Animal Data Doravirine was administered orally to pregnant rabbits ( up to 300 mg / kg / day on gestation days ( GD ) 7 to 20 ) and rats ( up to 450 mg / kg / day on GD 6 to 20 and separately from GD 6 to lactation / postpartum day 20 ) .
No significant toxicological effects on embryo - fetal ( rats and rabbits ) or pre / post - natal ( rats ) development were observed at exposures ( AUC ) approximately 9 times ( rats ) and 8 times ( rabbits ) the exposure in humans at the RHD .
Doravirine was transferred to the fetus through the placenta in embryo - fetal studies , with fetal plasma concentrations of up to 40 % ( rabbits ) and 52 % ( rats ) that of maternal concentrations observed on gestation day 20 .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV - 1 - infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking potential transmission of HIV - 1 infection .
It is unknown whether doravirine is present in human milk , affects human milk production , or has effects on the breastfed infant .
Doravirine is present in the milk of lactating rats ( see Data ) .
Because of the potential for ( 1 ) HIV - 1 transmission ( in HIV - negative infants ) , ( 2 ) developing viral resistance ( in HIV - positive infants ) , and ( 3 ) serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant , instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving PIFELTRO .
Data Doravirine was excreted into the milk of lactating rats following oral administration ( 450 mg / kg / day ) from gestation day 6 to lactation day 14 , with milk concentrations approximately 1 . 5 times that of maternal plasma concentrations observed 2 hours post dose on lactation day 14 .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of PIFELTRO for the treatment of HIV - 1 infection have been established in pediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Use of PIFELTRO in this group is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled trials in adults and an open - label trial in virologically - suppressed or treatment - naïve pediatric subjects 12 to less than 18 years of age .
The safety , efficacy , and exposure of doravirine in these pediatric subjects were similar to that in adults .
[ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) . ]
Safety and efficacy of PIFELTRO in pediatric patients weighing less than 35 kg have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of PIFELTRO did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , caution should be exercised in the administration of PIFELTRO in elderly patients , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment of PIFELTRO is required in patients with mild , moderate , or severe renal impairment .
PIFELTRO has not been adequately studied in patients with end - stage renal disease and has not been studied in dialysis patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment of PIFELTRO is required in patients with mild ( Child - Pugh Class A ) or moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B ) hepatic impairment .
PIFELTRO has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Doravirine is an antiretroviral drug [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In a Phase 2 trial evaluating doravirine over a dose range of 0 . 25 to 2 times the recommended dose of PIFELTRO , ( in combination with FTC / TDF ) in HIV - 1 - infected subjects with no antiretroviral treatment history , no exposure - response relationship for efficacy was identified for doravirine .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At a doravirine dose of 1200 mg , which provides approximately 4 times the peak concentration observed following the recommended dose of PIFELTRO , doravirine does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Doravirine pharmacokinetics are similar in healthy subjects and HIV - 1 - infected subjects .
Doravirine pharmacokinetics are provided in Table 7 .

High fat meal is approximately 1 , 000 kcal , 50 % fat .
The effect of food is not clinically relevant .
[ 4 ] Based on IV dose Specific Populations In adults , no clinically significant difference on the pharmacokinetics of doravirine were observed based on age ( 18 to 78 years of age ) , sex , and race / ethnicity , mild to severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) > 15 mL / min , estimated by Cockcroft - Gault ) , or moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh B ) .
The pharmacokinetics of doravirine in patients with end - stage renal disease or undergoing dialysis , or severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) is unknown .
Patients with Renal Impairment In a study comparing 8 subjects with severe renal impairment to 8 subjects without renal impairment , the single dose exposure of doravirine was 43 % higher in subjects with severe renal impairment .
In a population pharmacokinetic analysis , renal function did not have a clinically relevant effect on doravirine pharmacokinetics .
Doravirine has not been studied in patients with end - stage renal disease or in patients undergoing dialysis [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinically significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of doravirine was observed in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh score B ) compared to subjects without hepatic impairment .
Doravirine has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh score C ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Pediatric Patients Mean doravirine exposures were similar in 54 pediatric patients aged 12 to less than 18 years and weighing at least 35 kg who received doravirine or DELSTRIGO in IMPAACT 2014 ( Protocol 027 ) relative to adults following administration of doravirine or DELSTRIGO ( Table 8 ) .
For pediatric patients weighing ≥ 35 kg and < 45 kg who receive doravirine 100 mg or DELSTRIGO , the population pharmacokinetic model - predicted mean C24 of doravirine was comparable to that achieved in adults , whereas mean AUC0 - 24 and Cmax of doravirine were 25 % and 36 % higher than adult values , respectively .
However , the predicted AUC0 - 24 and Cmax increases are not considered clinically significant .

Co - administration of doravirine and drugs that induce CYP3A may result in decreased plasma concentrations of doravirine .
Co - administration of doravirine and drugs that inhibit CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of doravirine .
Doravirine is not likely to have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of medicinal products metabolized by CYP enzymes .
Doravirine did not inhibit major drug metabolizing enzymes in vitro , including CYPs 1A2 , 2B6 , 2C8 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 3A4 , and UGT1A1 and is not likely to be an inducer of CYP1A2 , 2B6 , or 3A4 .
Based on in vitro assays , doravirine is not likely to be an inhibitor of OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , P - glycoprotein , BSEP , OAT1 , OAT3 , OCT2 , MATE1 , and MATE2K .
Drug interaction studies were performed with doravirine and other drugs likely to be co - administered or commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interactions .
The effects of co - administration with other drugs on the exposure ( Cmax , AUC , and C24 ) of doravirine are summarized in Table 9 .
A single doravirine 100 mg dose was administered in these studies unless otherwise noted .

[ 2 ] Changes in doravirine pharmacokinetic values are not clinically relevant .
[ 3 ] Doravirine 100 mg BID resulted in similar pharmacokinetic values when compared to 100 mg QD without rifabutin .
[ 4 ] A single doravirine 50 mg dose ( 0 . 5 times the recommended approved dose ) was administered .
[ 5 ] The first day following the cessation of efavirenz therapy and initiation of doravirine 100 mg QD .
[ 6 ] 14 days following the cessation of efavirenz therapy and initiation of doravirine 100 mg QD .
Based on drug interaction studies conducted with doravirine , no clinically significant drug interactions have been observed following the co - administration of doravirine and the following drugs : dolutegravir , ritonavir , TDF , lamivudine , elbasvir and grazoprevir , ledipasvir and sofosbuvir , ketoconazole , aluminum hydroxide / magnesium hydroxide / simethicone containing antacid , pantoprazole , atorvastatin , an oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel , metformin , methadone , and midazolam .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Doravirine is a pyridinone non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor of HIV - 1 and inhibits HIV - 1 replication by non - competitive inhibition of HIV - 1 reverse transcriptase ( RT ) .
The inhibitory concentration at 50 % ( IC50 ) of doravirine for RNA - dependent DNA polymerization of recombinant wild - type HIV - 1 RT in a biochemical assay was 12 . 2 ± 2 . 0 nM ( n = 3 ) .
Doravirine does not inhibit the human cellular DNA polymerases α , β , and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ .
Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Doravirine exhibited an EC50 value of 12 . 0 ± 4 . 4 nM against wild - type laboratory strains of HIV - 1 when tested in the presence of 100 % normal human serum ( NHS ) using MT4 - GFP reporter cells and a median EC50 value for HIV - 1 subtype B primary isolates ( n = 118 ) of 4 . 1 nM ( range : 1 . 0 nM - 16 . 0 nM ) .
Doravirine demonstrated antiviral activity against a broad panel of primary HIV - 1 isolates ( A , A1 , AE , AG , B , BF , C , D , G , H ) with EC50 values ranging from 1 . 2 nM to 10 . 0 nM .
Antiviral Activity in Combination with other HIV Antiviral Agents The antiviral activity of doravirine in cell culture was not antagonistic when combined with the NNRTIs delavirdine , efavirenz , etravirine , nevirapine , or rilpivirine ; the NRTIs abacavir , didanosine , emtricitabine , lamivudine , stavudine , tenofovir DF , or zidovudine ; the PIs darunavir or indinavir ; the gp41 fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide ; the CCR5 co - receptor antagonist maraviroc ; or the integrase strand transfer inhibitor raltegravir .
Resistance In Cell Culture Doravirine - resistant strains were selected in cell culture starting from wild - type HIV - 1 of different origins and subtypes , as well as NNRTI - resistant HIV - 1 .
Observed emergent amino acid substitutions in RT included : V106A , V106I , V106M , V108I , H221Y , F227C , F227I , F227L , F227V , M230I , L234I , P236L , and Y318F .
The V106A , V106M , V108I , H221Y , F227C , M230I , P236L , and Y318F substitutions conferred 3 . 4 - fold to 70 - fold reductions in susceptibility to doravirine .
Y318F in combination with V106A , V106M , V108I , and F227C conferred greater decreases in susceptibility to doravirine than Y318F alone , which conferred a 10 - fold reduction in susceptibility to doravirine .
In Clinical Trials Clinical Trial Results in Adults with No Antiretroviral Treatment History In the doravirine treatment arms of the DRIVE - FORWARD and DRIVE - AHEAD trials ( n = 747 ) through Week 96 , 13 subjects showed the emergence of doravirine resistance - associated substitutions in their HIV among 36 ( 36 % ) subjects in the resistance analysis subset ( subjects with HIV - 1 RNA greater than 400 copies per mL at virologic failure or early study discontinuation and having post - baseline resistance samples ) .
Emergent doravirine resistance - associated substitutions in RT included one or more of the following : V90G / I , A98G , V106A , V106I , V106M / T , V108I , E138G , Y188L , H221Y , P225H , P225L , P225P / S , F227C , F227C / R , Y318Y / F and Y318Y / S .
Eight of 13 ( 62 % ) subjects with emergent doravirine resistance - associated substitutions showed doravirine phenotypic resistance and most of them had at least a 100 - fold reduction in doravirine susceptibility ( range > 95 - to > 211 – fold reduction in doravirine susceptibility ) .
The other 5 virologic failures who had only amino acid mixtures of NNRTI resistance substitutions showed doravirine phenotypic fold - changes of less than 2 - fold .
Of the 36 subjects in the resistance analysis subset , 10 subjects ( 28 % ) developed genotypic and / or phenotypic resistance to the other drugs ( abacavir , emtricitabine , lamivudine , or tenofovir ) in the regimens of the DRIVE - FORWARD and DRIVE - AHEAD trials .
The resistance - associated substitutions that emerged were RT M41L ( n = 1 ) , A62A / V ( n = 1 ) , K65R ( n = 2 ) , T69T / A ( n = 1 ) , V75V / I ( n = 1 ) , and M184I or V ( n = 7 ) .
In the DRV / r treatment arm of the DRIVE - FORWARD trial ( n = 383 ) through Week 96 , no subjects showed the emergence of darunavir resistance - associated substitutions among 15 subjects with resistance data and 2 of the subjects had emergent genotypic or phenotypic resistance to lamivudine or tenofovir .
In the EFV / FTC / TDF treatment arm of the DRIVE - AHEAD trial ( n = 364 ) through Week 96 , 15 subjects showed the emergence of efavirenz resistance - associated substitutions among 25 ( 60 % ) subjects in the resistance analysis subset and genotypic resistance to emtricitabine or tenofovir developed in 5 evaluable subjects ; emergent resistance - associated substitutions were RT K65R ( n = 1 ) , D67G / K70E ( n = 1 ) , L74V / V75M / V118I ( n = 1 ) , M184I or V ( n = 5 ) , and K219K / E ( n = 1 ) .
Clinical Trial Results in Virologically - Suppressed Adults In the DRIVE - SHIFT clinical trial [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] , there were 6 subjects in the immediate switch group ( n = 447 ) and 2 subjects in the delayed switch group ( n = 209 ) who met the protocol - defined virologic failure criteria ( confirmed HIV - 1 RNA ≥ 50 copies / mL ) .
Two of the 6 virologic failure subjects in the immediate switch group had available resistance data and neither developed detectable genotypic or phenotypic resistance to doravirine , lamivudine , or tenofovir during treatment with DELSTRIGO .
One of the two virologic failure subjects in the delayed switch group who had available resistance data developed the RT M184M / I substitution and phenotypic resistance to emtricitabine and lamivudine during treatment with their baseline regimen .
Cross - Resistance Cross - resistance has been observed among NNRTIs .
Treatment - emergent doravirine resistance - associated substitutions can confer cross - resistance to efavirenz , etravirine , nevirapine , and rilpivirine .
Of the 8 virologic failure subjects who developed doravirine phenotypic resistance , all had phenotypic resistance to nevirapine , 6 had phenotypic resistance to efavirenz , 4 had phenotypic resistance to rilpivirine , and 4 had resistance to etravirine in the Monogram PhenoSense assay .
Of the 11 virologic failure subjects in DRIVE - AHEAD phenotypically resistant to efavirenz , 2 ( 18 % ) had decreased susceptibility to doravirine ( 18 - and 36 - fold ) .
The treatment - emergent doravirine resistance - associated substitution Y318F did not confer reduced susceptibility to efavirenz , etravirine , or rilpivirine .
A panel of 96 diverse clinical isolates containing NNRTI resistance - associated substitutions was evaluated for susceptibility to doravirine .
Clinical isolates containing the Y188L substitution alone or in combination with K103N or V106I , V106A in combination with G190A and F227L , or E138K in combination with Y181C and M230L showed greater than 100 - fold reduced susceptibility to doravirine .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Doravirine was not carcinogenic in long - term oral carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats at exposures up to 6 and 7 times , respectively , the human exposures at the RHD .
A statistically significant incidence of thyroid parafollicular cell adenoma and carcinoma seen only in female rats at the high dose was within the range observed in historical controls .
Mutagenesis Doravirine was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays , including microbial mutagenesis , chromosomal aberration in Chinese hamster ovary cells , and in in vivo rat micronucleus assays .
Impairment of fertility There were no effects on fertility , mating performance or early embryonic development when doravirine was administered to rats at systemic exposures ( AUC ) approximately 7 times the exposure in humans at the RHD .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Clinical Trial Results in Adults with No Antiretroviral Treatment History The efficacy of PIFELTRO is based on the analyses of 96 - week data from two randomized , multicenter , double - blind , active controlled Phase 3 trials ( DRIVE - FORWARD , NCT02275780 and DRIVE - AHEAD , NCT02403674 ) in HIV - 1 - infected subjects with no antiretroviral treatment history ( n = 1494 ) .

14 . 2 Clinical Trial Results in Virologically - Suppressed Adults The efficacy of switching from a baseline regimen consisting of two NRTIs in combination with a PI plus either ritonavir or cobicistat , or elvitegravir plus cobicistat , or an NNRTI to DELSTRIGO was evaluated in a randomized , open - label trial ( DRIVE - SHIFT , NCT02397096 ) , in virologically - suppressed HIV - 1 - infected adults .
Subjects must have been virologically - suppressed ( HIV - 1 RNA < 50 copies / mL ) on their baseline regimen for at least 6 months prior to trial entry , with no history of virologic failure .
Subjects were randomized to either switch to DELSTRIGO at baseline ( n = 447 , Immediate Switch Group ( ISG ) ) , or stay on their baseline regimen until Week 24 , at which point they switched to DELSTRIGO ( n = 223 , Delayed Switch Group ( DSG ) ) .
At baseline , the median age of subjects was 43 years , 16 % were female , and 24 % were Non - White , 21 % were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity , 3 % had hepatitis B and / or C virus co - infection , 17 % had a history of AIDS , 96 % had CD4 + T - cell count greater than or equal to 200 cells / mm3 , 70 % were on a regimen containing a PI plus ritonavir , 24 % were on a regimen containing an NNRTI , 6 % were on a regimen containing elvitegravir plus cobicistat , and 1 % were on a regimen containing a PI plus cobicistat ; these characteristics were similar between treatment groups .

14 . 3 Clinical Trial Results in Pediatric Patients The efficacy of DELSTRIGO ( DOR / 3 TC / TDF ) was evaluated in cohort 2 of an open - label , single - arm 2 - cohort trial in HIV - 1 - infected pediatric patients 12 to less than 18 years of age ( IMPAACT 2014 ( Protocol 027 ) , NCT03332095 ) .
In cohort 1 , virologically - suppressed subjects ( n = 9 ) received a single 100 mg dose of PIFELTRO followed by intensive PK sampling .
In cohort 2 , virologically - suppressed subjects ( n = 43 ) were switched to DELSTRIGO and treatment - naïve subjects ( n = 2 ) were started on DELSTRIGO .
In cohort 2 , at baseline the median age of subjects was 15 years ( range : 12 to 17 ) , the median weight was 52 kg ( range : 45 to 80 ) , 58 % were female , 78 % were Asian and 22 % were Black , and the median CD4 + T - cell count was 713 cells per mm3 ( range 84 to 1397 ) .
After switching to DELSTRIGO , 95 % ( 41 / 43 ) of virologically - suppressed subjects remained suppressed ( HIV - 1 RNA < 50 copies / mL ) at Week 24 .
One of the two treatment - naïve subjects achieved HIV - 1 RNA < 50 copies / mL at Week 24 .
The other treatment - naïve subject met the protocol - defined virologic failure criteria ( defined as 2 consecutive plasma HIV - 1 RNA test results ≥ 200 copies / mL at or after Week 24 ) and was evaluated for the development of resistance ; no emergence of genotypic or phenotypic resistance to doravirine , lamivudine , or tenofovir was detected .
