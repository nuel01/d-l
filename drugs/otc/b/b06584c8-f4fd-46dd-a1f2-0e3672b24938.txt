Ototoxicity : In the case of grade 3 toxicity , discontinue treatment .
Nephrotoxicity : In the event of a rise in serum creatinine ≥ grade 2 ( > 1 . 5 x normal value ) despite adequate rehydration , CrCl should be determined before each subsequent cycle and the following dose reductions should be considered ( see Table 2 ) .
For other cisplatin dosage adjustments , also refer to the manufacturers ’ prescribing information .
Table 2 – Dose Reductions for Evaluation of Creatinine Clearance Creatinine clearance resultbefore next cycle Cisplatin dose next cycle CrCl ≥ 60 mL / min Full dose of cisplatin was given .
CrCl was to be repeated before each treatment cycle .
CrCl between 40 and 59 mL / min Dose of cisplatin was reduced by 50 % at subsequent cycle .
If CrCl was > 60 mL / min at end of cycle , full cisplatin dose was reinstituted at the next cycle .
If no recovery was observed , then cisplatin was omitted from the next treatment cycle .
CrCl < 40 mL / min Dose of cisplatin was omitted in that treatment cycle only .
If CrCl was still < 40 mL / min at the end of cycle , cisplatin was discontinued .
If CrCl was > 40 and < 60 mL / min at end of cycle , a 50 % cisplatin dose was given at the next cycle .
If CrCl was > 60 mL / min at end of cycle , full cisplatin dose was given at next cycle .
CrCl = Creatinine clearance Fluorouracil dose modifications and treatment delays For diarrhea and stomatitis , see Table 1 .
In the event of grade 2 or greater plantar - palmar toxicity , fluorouracil should be stopped until recovery .
The fluorouracil dosage should be reduced by 20 % .
For other greater than grade 3 toxicities , except alopecia and anemia , chemotherapy should be delayed ( for a maximum of 2 weeks from the planned date of infusion ) until resolution to grade ≤ 1 and then recommenced , if medically appropriate .
For other fluorouracil dosage adjustments , also refer to the manufacturers ’ prescribing information .
Combination Therapy with Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors : Avoid using concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e . g . , ketoconazole , itraconazole , clarithromycin , atazanavir , indinavir , nefazodone , nelfinavir , ritonavir , saquinavir , telithromycin and voriconazole ) .
There are no clinical data with a dose adjustment in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors .
Based on extrapolation from a pharmacokinetic study with ketoconazole in 7 patients , consider a 50 % docetaxel dose reduction if patients require coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor .
[ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 8 Administration Precautions Docetaxel injection is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and , as with other potentially toxic compounds , caution should be exercised when handling and preparing docetaxel injection solutions .
The use of gloves is recommended [ see How Supplied / Storage and Handling ( 16 . 3 ) ] .
If docetaxel injection , initial diluted solution , or final dilution for infusion should come into contact with the skin , immediately and thoroughly wash with soap and water .
If docetaxel injection initial diluted solution , or final dilution for infusion should come into contact with mucosa , immediately and thoroughly wash with water .
Contact of the docetaxel injection , with plasticized PVC equipment or devices used to prepare solutions for infusion is not recommended .
In order to minimize patient exposure to the plasticizer DEHP ( di - 2 - ethylhexyl phthalate ) , which may be leached from PVC infusion bags or sets , the final docetaxel injection dilution for infusion should be stored in bottles ( glass , polypropylene ) or plastic bags ( polypropylene , polyolefin ) and administered through polyethylene - lined administration sets .
One - vial Docetaxel Injection USP Docetaxel injection , requires NO prior dilution with a diluent and is ready to add to the infusion solution .
Please follow the preparation instructions provided below .
2 . 9 Preparation and Administration DO NOT use the two - vial formulation ( Injection and diluent ) with the one - vial formulation .
One - vial Docetaxel Injection USP Docetaxel injection , ( 20 mg / mL ) requires NO prior dilution with a diluent and is ready to add to the infusion solution .
Use only a 21 gauge needle to withdraw docetaxel injection from the vial because larger bore needles ( e . g . , 18 and 19 gauge ) may result in stopper coring and rubber particulates .
1 .
Docetaxel vials should be stored between 2 ° C and 25 ° C ( 36 ° F and 77 ° F ) .
If the vials are stored under refrigeration , allow the appropriate number of vials of docetaxel injection , vials to stand at room temperature for approximately 5 minutes before use .
2 .
Using only a 21 gauge needle , aseptically withdraw the required amount of docetaxel injection ( 20 mg docetaxel / mL ) with a calibrated syringe and inject via a single injection ( one shot ) into a 250 mL infusion bag or bottle of either 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride solution or 5 % Dextrose solution to produce a final concentration of 0 . 3 mg / mL to 0 . 74 mg / mL .
If a dose greater than 200 mg of docetaxel is required , use a larger volume of the infusion vehicle so that a concentration of 0 . 74 mg / mL docetaxel is not exceeded .
3 .
Thoroughly mix the infusion by gentle manual rotation .
4 .
As with all parenteral products , docetaxel should be inspected visually for particulate matter or discoloration prior to administration whenever the solution and container permit .
If the docetaxel dilution for intravenous infusion is not clear or appears to have precipitation , it should be discarded .
5 .
Docetaxel infusion solution is supersaturated , therefore may crystallize over time .
If crystals appear , the solution must no longer be used and shall be discarded .
The docetaxel dilution for infusion should be administered intravenously as a 1 - hour infusion under ambient room temperature ( below 25 ° C ) and lighting conditions .
2 . 10 Stability Docetaxel injection final dilution for infusion , if stored between 2 ° C and 25 ° C ( 36 ° F and 77 ° F ) is stable for 6 hours .
Docetaxel injection final dilution for infusion ( in either 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride solution or 5 % Dextrose solution ) should be used within 6 hours ( including the 1 hour intravenous administration ) .
In addition , physical and chemical in - use stability of the infusion solution prepared as recommended has been demonstrated in non - PVC bags up to 48 hours when stored between 2 ° C and 8 ° C ( 36 ° F and 46 ° F ) .

Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception .
( 5 . 12 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) • Alcohol content : The alcohol content in a dose of docetaxel injection may affect the central nervous system .
This may include impairment of a patient ’ s ability to drive or use machines immediately after infusion .
( 5 . 13 ) • Tumor lysis syndrome : Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported .
Patients at risk should be well hydrated and closely monitored during treatment ( 5 . 14 ) 5 . 1 Toxic Deaths Breast Cancer Docetaxel injection administered at 100 mg / m2 was associated with deaths considered possibly or probably related to treatment in 2 % ( 19 / 965 ) of metastatic breast cancer patients , both previously treated and untreated , with normal baseline liver function and in 11 . 5 % ( 7 / 61 ) of patients with various tumor types who had abnormal baseline liver function ( AST and / or ALT > 1 . 5 times ULN together with AP > 2 . 5 times ULN ) .
Among patients dosed at 60 mg / m2 , mortality related to treatment occurred in 0 . 6 % ( 3 / 481 ) of patients with normal liver function , and in 3 of 7 patients with abnormal liver function .
Approximately half of these deaths occurred during the first cycle .
Sepsis accounted for the majority of the deaths .
Non - small Cell Lung Cancer Docetaxel injection administered at a dose of 100 mg / m2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non - small cell lung cancer who had a history of prior platinum - based chemotherapy was associated with increased treatment - related mortality ( 14 % and 5 % in two randomized , controlled studies ) .
There were 2 . 8 % treatment - related deaths among the 176 patients treated at the 75 mg / m2 dose in the randomized trials .
Among patients who experienced treatment - related mortality at the 75 mg / m2 dose level , 3 of 5 patients had an ECOG PS of 2 at study entry [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
5 . 2 Hepatic Impairment Patients with elevations of bilirubin or abnormalities of transaminase concurrent with alkaline phosphatase are at increased risk for the development of severe neutropenia , febrile neutropenia , infections , severe thrombocytopenia , severe stomatitis , severe skin toxicity , and toxic death .
Avoid docetaxel injection in patients with bilirubin > upper limit of normal ( ULN ) , or to patients with AST and / or ALT > 1 . 5 × ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase > 2 . 5 × ULN [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
For patients with isolated elevations of transaminase > 1 . 5 × ULN , consider docetaxel injection dose modifications [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) ] .
Measure bilirubin , AST or ALT , and alkaline phosphatase prior to each cycle of docetaxel injection therapy .
5 . 3 Hematologic Effects Perform frequent peripheral blood cell counts on all patients receiving docetaxel injection .
Do not retreat patients with subsequent cycles of docetaxel injection until neutrophils recover to a level > 1500 cells / mm3 [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Avoid retreating patients until platelets recover to a level > 100 , 000 cells / mm3 .
A 25 % reduction in the dose of docetaxel injection is recommended during subsequent cycles following severe neutropenia ( < 500 cells / mm3 ) lasting 7 days or more , febrile neutropenia , or a grade 4 infection in a docetaxel injection cycle [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) ] .
Neutropenia ( < 2000 neutrophils / mm3 ) occurs in virtually all patients given 60 mg / m2 to 100 mg / m2 of docetaxel injection and grade 4 neutropenia ( < 500 cells / mm3 ) occurs in 85 % of patients given 100 mg / m2 and 75 % of patients given 60 mg / m2 .
Frequent monitoring of blood counts is , therefore , essential so that dose can be adjusted .
Docetaxel injection should not be administered to patients with neutrophils < 1500 cells / mm3 .
Febrile neutropenia occurred in about 12 % of patients given 100 mg / m2 but was very uncommon in patients given 60 mg / m2 .
Hematologic responses , febrile reactions and infections , and rates of septic death for different regimens are dose related [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Three breast cancer patients with severe liver impairment ( bilirubin > 1 . 7 times ULN ) developed fatal gastrointestinal bleeding associated with severe drug - induced thrombocytopenia .
In gastric cancer patients treated with docetaxel in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil ( TCF ) , febrile neutropenia and / or neutropenic infection occurred in 12 % of patients receiving G - CSF compared to 28 % who did not .
Patients receiving TCF should be closely monitored during the first and subsequent cycles for febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
5 . 4 Enterocolitis and Neutropenic Colitis Enterocolitis and neutropenic colitis ( typhlitis ) have occurred in patients treated with docetaxel injection alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents , despite the coadministration of G - CSF .
Caution is recommended for patients with neutropenia , particularly at risk for developing gastrointestinal complications .
Enterocolitis and neutropenic enterocolitis may develop at any time , and could lead to death as early as the first day of symptom onset .
Monitor patients closely from onset of any symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity .
Inform patients to contact their healthcare provider with new , or worsening symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Monitor patients closely for hypersensitivity reactions , especially during the first and second infusions .
Severe hypersensitivity reactions characterized by generalized rash / erythema , hypotension and / or bronchospasm , or fatal anaphylaxis , have been reported in patients premedicated with 3 days of corticosteroids .
Severe hypersensitivity reactions require immediate discontinuation of the docetaxel infusion and aggressive therapy .
Do not rechallenge patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions with docetaxel injection [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Patients who have previously experienced a hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel may develop a hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel that may include severe or fatal reactions such as anaphylaxis .
Monitor patients with a previous history of hypersensitivity to paclitaxel closely during initiation of docetaxel injection therapy .
Hypersensitivity reactions may occur within a few minutes following initiation of a docetaxel infusion .
If minor reactions such as flushing or localized skin reactions occur , interruption of therapy is not required .
All patients should be premedicated with an oral corticosteroid prior to the initiation of the infusion of docetaxel injection [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
5 . 6 Fluid Retention Severe fluid retention has been reported following docetaxel injection therapy .
Patients should be premedicated with oral corticosteroids prior to each docetaxel injection administration to reduce the incidence and severity of fluid retention [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
Patients with pre - existing effusions should be closely monitored from the first dose for the possible exacerbation of the effusions .
When fluid retention occurs , peripheral edema usually starts in the lower extremities and may become generalized with a median weight gain of 2 kg .
Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3 - day corticosteroids , moderate fluid retention occurred in 27 . 2 % and severe fluid retention in 6 . 5 % .
The median cumulative dose to onset of moderate or severe fluid retention was 819 mg / m2 .
Nine of 92 patients ( 9 . 8 % ) of patients discontinued treatment due to fluid retention : 4 patients discontinued with severe fluid retention ; the remaining 5 had mild or moderate fluid retention .
The median cumulative dose to treatment discontinuation due to fluid retention was 1021 mg / m2 .
Fluid retention was completely , but sometimes slowly , reversible with a median of 16 weeks from the last infusion of docetaxel injection to resolution ( range : 0 to 42 + weeks ) .
Patients developing peripheral edema may be treated with standard measures , e . g . , salt restriction , oral diuretic ( s ) .
5 . 7 Second Primary Malignancies Second primary malignancies , notably acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , Non - Hodgkin ' s Lymphoma ( NHL ) , and renal cancer , have been reported in patients treated with docetaxel - containing regimens .
These adverse reactions may occur several months or years after docetaxel - containing therapy .
Treatment - related AML or MDS has occurred in patients given anthracyclines and / or cyclophosphamide , including use in adjuvant therapy for breast cancer .
In the adjuvant breast cancer trial ( TAX316 ) AML occurred in 3 of 744 patients who received docetaxel injection , doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide ( TAC ) and in 1 of 736 patients who received fluorouracil , doxorubicin , and cyclophosphamide [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
In TAC - treated patients , the risk of delayed myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia requires hematological follow - up .
Monitor patients for second primary malignancies [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 8 Cutaneous Reactions Localized erythema of the extremities with edema followed by desquamation has been observed .
In case of severe skin toxicity , an adjustment in dosage is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) ] .
The discontinuation rate due to skin toxicity was 1 . 6 % ( 15 / 965 ) for metastatic breast cancer patients .
Among 92 breast cancer patients premedicated with 3 - day corticosteroids , there were no cases of severe skin toxicity reported and no patient discontinued docetaxel injection due to skin toxicity .
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions ( SCARs ) such as Stevens - Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) , toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis ( AGEP ) have been reported in association with docetaxel treatment .
Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of serious skin manifestations and monitored closely .
Permanent treatment discontinuation should be considered in patients who experience SCARs .
5 . 9 Neurologic Reactions Severe neurosensory symptoms ( e . g . paresthesia , dysesthesia , pain ) were observed in 5 . 5 % ( 53 / 965 ) of metastatic breast cancer patients , and resulted in treatment discontinuation in 6 . 1 % .
When these symptoms occur , dosage must be adjusted .
If symptoms persist , treatment should be discontinued [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) ] .
Patients who experienced neurotoxicity in clinical trials and for whom follow - up information on the complete resolution of the event was available had spontaneous reversal of symptoms with a median of 9 weeks from onset ( range : 0 to 106 weeks ) .
Severe peripheral motor neuropathy mainly manifested as distal extremity weakness occurred in 4 . 4 % ( 42 / 965 ) .
5 . 10 Eye Disorders Cystoid macular edema ( CME ) has been reported in patients treated with docetaxel .
Patients with impaired vision should undergo a prompt and comprehensive ophthalmologic examination .
If CME is diagnosed , docetaxel treatment should be discontinued and appropriate treatment initiated .
Alternative non - taxane cancer treatment should be considered .
5 . 11 Asthenia Severe asthenia has been reported in 14 . 9 % ( 144 / 965 ) of metastatic breast cancer patients but has led to treatment discontinuation in only 1 . 8 % .
Symptoms of fatigue and weakness may last a few days up to several weeks and may be associated with deterioration of performance status in patients with progressive disease .
5 . 12 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action , docetaxel injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
Available data from case reports in the literature and pharmacovigilance with docetaxel use in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform the drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of docetaxel to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused embryo - fetal toxicities , including intrauterine mortality , at doses as low as 0 . 02 and 0 . 003 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area , respectively .
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus .
Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating docetaxel injection .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of docetaxel injection .
Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of docetaxel injection [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 13 Alcohol Content Cases of intoxication have been reported with some formulations of docetaxel due to the alcohol content .
The alcohol content in a dose of docetaxel injection may affect the central nervous system and should be taken into account for patients in whom alcohol intake should be avoided or minimized .
Consideration should be given to the alcohol content in docetaxel injection on the ability to drive or use machines immediately after the infusion .
Each administration of docetaxel injection at 100 mg / m2 delivers 2 g / m2 of ethanol .
For a patient with a BSA of 2 m2 , this would deliver 4 grams of ethanol [ see Description ( 11 ) ] .
Other docetaxel products may have a different amount of alcohol .
5 . 14 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported with docetaxel [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Patients at risk of tumor lysis syndrome ( e . g . , with renal impairment , hyperuricemia , bulky tumor ) should be closely monitored prior to initiating docetaxel injection and periodically during treatment .
Correction of dehydration and treatment of high uric acid levels are recommended prior to initiation of treatment .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most serious adverse reactions from docetaxel injection are : • Toxic Deaths [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Hepatic Impairment [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Hematologic Effects [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Enterocolitis and Neutropenic Colitis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Fluid Retension [ see Boxed Warning , see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Second Primary Malignancies [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] • Cutaneous Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] • Neurologic Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] • Eye Disorders [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 ) ] • Asthenia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) ] • Alcohol Content [ see Warnings and Precations ( 5 . 13 ) ] The most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel injection indications are infections , neutropenia , anemia , febrile neutropenia , hypersensitivity , thrombocytopenia , neuropathy , dysgeusia , dyspnea , constipation , anorexia , nail disorders , fluid retention , asthenia , pain , nausea , diarrhea , vomiting , mucositis , alopecia , skin reactions , and myalgia .
Incidence varies depending on the indication .
Adverse reactions are described according to indication .
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Responding patients may not experience an improvement in performance status on therapy and may experience worsening .
The relationship between changes in performance status , response to therapy , and treatment - related side effects has not been established .
Most common adverse reactions across all docetaxel injection indications are infections , neutropenia , anemia , febrile neutropenia , hypersensitivity , thrombocytopenia , neuropathy , dysgeusia , dyspnea , constipation , anorexia , nail disorders , fluid retention , asthenia , pain , nausea , diarrhea , vomiting , mucositis , alopecia , skin reactions , and myalgia ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Dr .

These reactions were described using COSTART terms and were considered possibly or probably related to docetaxel injection .
At least 95 % of these patients did not receive hematopoietic support .
The safety profile is generally similar in patients receiving docetaxel injection for the treatment of breast cancer and in patients with other tumor types .

Cutaneous reactions Severe skin toxicity is discussed elsewhere in the label [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] .
Reversible cutaneous reactions characterized by a rash including localized eruptions , mainly on the feet and / or hands , but also on the arms , face , or thorax , usually associated with pruritus , have been observed .
Eruptions generally occurred within 1 week after docetaxel injection infusion , recovered before the next infusion , and were not disabling .
Severe nail disorders were characterized by hypo - or hyperpigmentation , and occasionally by onycholysis ( in 0 . 8 % of patients with solid tumors ) and pain .
Neurologic reactions Neurologic reactions are discussed elsewhere in the label [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] Gastrointestinal reactions Nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea were generally mild to moderate .

Clinically meaningful events such as heart failure , sinus tachycardia , atrial flutter , dysrhythmia , unstable angina , pulmonary edema , and hypertension have occurred .
Seven of 86 ( 8 . 1 % ) of metastatic breast cancer patients receiving docetaxel injection 100 mg / m2 in a randomized trial and who had serial left ventricular ejection fractions assessed developed deterioration of LVEF by ≥ 10 % associated with a drop below the institutional lower limit of normal .
Infusion site reactions Infusion site reactions were generally mild and consisted of hyperpigmentation , inflammation , redness or dryness of the skin , phlebitis , extravasation , or swelling of the vein .
Hepatic reactions In patients with normal LFTs at baseline , bilirubin values greater than the ULN occurred in 8 . 9 % of patients .
Increases in AST or ALT > 1 . 5 times the ULN , or alkaline phosphatase > 2 . 5 times ULN , were observed in 18 . 9 % and 7 . 3 % of patients , respectively .
While on docetaxel injection , increases in AST and / or ALT > 1 . 5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase > 2 . 5 times ULN occurred in 4 . 3 % of patients with normal LFTs at baseline .
Whether these changes were related to the drug or underlying disease has not been established .
Hematologic and other toxicity : Relation to dose and baseline liver chemistry abnormalities Hematologic and other toxicity is increased at higher doses and in patients with elevated baseline liver function tests ( LFTs ) .
In the following tables , adverse drug reactions are compared for three populations : 730 patients with normal LFTs given docetaxel injection at 100 mg / m2 in the randomized and single arm studies of metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy ; 18 patients in these studies who had abnormal baseline LFTs ( defined as AST and / or ALT > 1 . 5 times ULN concurrent with alkaline phosphatase > 2 . 5 times ULN ) ; and 174 patients in Japanese studies given docetaxel injection at 60 mg / m2 who had normal LFTs ( see Tables 4 and 5 ) .

Of the 744 patients treated with TAC , 36 . 3 % experienced severe treatment - emergent adverse reactions compared to 26 . 6 % of the 736 patients treated with FAC . Dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity occurred in 1 % of cycles in the TAC arm versus 0 . 1 % of cycles in the FAC arm .
Six percent of patients treated with TAC discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions , compared to 1 . 1 % treated with FAC ; fever in the absence of infection and allergy being the most common reasons for withdrawal among TAC - treated patients .
Two patients died in each arm within 30 days of their last study treatment ; 1 death per arm was attributed to study drugs .
Fever and infection During the treatment period , fever in the absence of infection was seen in 46 . 5 % of TAC - treated patients and in 17 . 1 % of FAC - treated patients .
Grade 3 / 4 fever in the absence of infection was seen in 1 . 3 % and 0 % of TAC - and FAC - treated patients respectively . Infection was seen in 39 . 4 % of TAC - treated patients compared to 36 . 3 % of FAC - treated patients .
Grade 3 / 4 infection was seen in 3 . 9 % and 2 . 2 % of TAC - treated and FAC - treated patients respectively .
There were no septic deaths in either treatment arm during the treatment period .
Gastrointestinal reactions In addition to gastrointestinal reactions reflected in the table above , 7 patients in the TAC arm were reported to have colitis / enteritis / large intestine perforation versus one patient in the FAC arm .
Five of the 7 TAC - treated patients required treatment discontinuation ; no deaths due to these events occurred during the treatment period .
Cardiovascular reactions More cardiovascular reactions were reported in the TAC arm versus the FAC arm during the treatment period : arrhythmias , all grades ( 6 . 2 % vs 4 . 9 % ) , and hypotension , all grades ( 1 . 9 % vs 0 . 8 % ) .
Twenty - six ( 26 ) patients ( 3 . 5 % ) in the TAC arm and 17 patients ( 2 . 3 % ) in the FAC arm developed CHF during the study period .
All except one patient in each arm were diagnosedwith CHF during the follow - up period .
Two ( 2 ) patients in TAC arm and 4 patients in FAC arm died due to CHF .
The risk of CHF was higher in the TAC arm in the first year , and then was similar in both treatment arms .
Adverse reactions during the follow - up period ( median follow up time of 8 years ) In study TAX316 , the most common adverse reactions thatstarted during the treatment period and persisted into thefollow - up period in TAC and FAC patients are described below ( median follow - up time of 8 years ) .
Nervous system disorders In study TAX316 , peripheral sensory neuropathy started during the treatment period and persisted into the follow - up period in 84 patients ( 11 . 3 % ) in TAC arm and 15 patients ( 2 % ) in FAC arm .
At the end of the follow - up period ( median follow - up timeof 8 years ) , peripheral sensory neuropathy was observed to beongoing in 10 patients ( 1 . 3 % ) in TAC arm , and in 2 patients ( 0 . 3 % ) in FAC arm .
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders In study TAX316 , alopecia persisting into the follow - up period after the end of chemotherapy was reported in 687 of 744 TAC patients ( 92 . 3 % ) and 645 of 736 FAC patients ( 87 . 6 % ) .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate .
In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce , inhibit , or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 .
In vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel increased 2 . 2 - fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 .
Protease inhibitors , particularly ritonavir , may increase the exposure of docetaxel .
Concomitant use of docetaxel injection and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided .
In patients receiving treatment with docetaxel injection , close monitoring for toxicity and a docetaxel injection dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) ] , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers , inhibitors , or substrates : May alter docetaxel metabolism .
( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise women not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) • Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : Verify pregnancy status of females prior to initiation of docetaxel injection .
( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action , docetaxel injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
Available data from case reports in the literature and pharmacovigilance with docetaxel use in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform the drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Docetaxel injection contains alcohol which can interfere with neurobehavioral development [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
In animal reproductive studies , administration of docetaxel to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused an increased incidence of embryo - fetal toxicities , including intrauterine mortality , at doses as low as 0 . 02 and 0 . 003 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area , respectively [ see Data ] .
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , miscarriage , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Docetaxel injection contains alcohol [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 13 ) ] .
Published studies have demonstrated that alcohol is associated with fetal harm including central nervous system abnormalities , behavioral disorders , and impaired intellectual development .
Data Animal data Intravenous administration of ≥ 0 . 3 and 0 . 03 mg / kg / day docetaxel to pregnant rats and rabbits , respectively , during the period of organogenesis caused an increased incidence of intrauterine mortality , resorptions , reduced fetal weights , and fetal ossification delays .
Maternal toxicity was also observed at these doses , which were approximately 0 . 02 and 0 . 003 times the daily maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of docetaxel in human milk , or on its effects on milk production or the breastfed child .
No lactation studies in animals have been conducted .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with docetaxel injection and for 1 week after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating docetaxel injection .
Contraception Females Docetaxel injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of docetaxel injection .
Males Based on genetic toxicity findings , advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of docetaxel injection .
Infertility Based on findings in animal studies , docetaxel injection may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The alcohol content of docetaxel injection should be taken into account when given to pediatric patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 13 ) ] .
The efficacy of docetaxel injection in pediatric patients as monotherapy or in combination has not been established .
The overall safety profile of docetaxel injection in pediatric patients receiving monotherapy or TCF was consistent with the known safety profile in adults .
Docetaxel injection has been studied in a total of 289 pediatric patients : 239 in 2 trials with monotherapy and 50 in combination treatment with cisplatin and 5 - fluorouracil ( TCF ) .
Docetaxel Injection Monotherapy Docetaxel injection monotherapy was evaluated in a dose - finding phase 1 trial in 61 pediatric patients ( median age 12 . 5 years , range 1 to 22 years ) with a variety of refractory solid tumors .
The recommended dose was 125 mg / m2 as a 1 - hour intravenous infusion every 21 days .
The primary dose limiting toxicity was neutropenia .
The recommended dose for docetaxel injection monotherapy was evaluated in a phase 2 single - arm trial in 178 pediatric patients ( median age 12 years , range 1 to 26 years ) with a variety of recurrent / refractory solid tumors . Efficacy was not established with tumor response rates ranging from one complete response ( CR ) ( 0 . 6 % ) in a patient with undifferentiated sarcoma to four partial responses ( 2 . 2 % ) seen in one patient each with Ewing Sarcoma , neuroblastoma , osteosarcoma , and squamous cell carcinoma .
Docetaxel Injection in Combination Docetaxel injection was studied in combination with cisplatin and 5 - fluorouracil ( TCF ) versus cisplatin and 5 - fluorouracil ( CF ) for the induction treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) in pediatric patients prior to chemoradiation consolidation .
Seventy - five patients ( median age 16 years , range 9 to 21 years ) were randomized ( 2 : 1 ) to docetaxel injection ( 75 mg / m ² ) in combination with cisplatin ( 75 mg / m ² ) and 5 - fluorouracil ( 750 mg / m ² ) ( TCF ) or to cisplatin ( 80 mg / m ² ) and 5 - fluorouracil ( 1000 mg / m ² / day ) ( CF ) .
The primary endpoint was the CR rate following induction treatment of NPC .
One patient out of 50 in the TCF group ( 2 % ) had a complete response while none of the 25 patients in the CF group had a complete response .
Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic parameters for docetaxel were determined in 2 pediatric solid tumor trials .
Following docetaxel administrationat 55 mg / m2 to 235 mg / m2 in a 1 - hour intravenous infusionevery 3 weeks in 25 patients aged 1 to 20 years ( median 11 years ) , docetaxel clearance was 17 . 3 ± 10 . 9 L / h / m2 .
Docetaxel was administered in combination with cisplatin and5 - fluorouracil ( TCF ) , at dose levels of 75 mg / m2 in a 1 - hourintravenous infusion day 1 in 28 patients aged 10 to 21 years ( median 16 years , 17 patients were older than 16 ) .
Docetaxelclearance was 17 . 9 ± 8 . 75 L / h / m2 , corresponding to an AUC of4 . 20 ± 2 . 57 mcg . h / mL .
In summary , the body surface area adjusted clearance ofdocetaxel monotherapy and TCF combination in childrenwere comparable to those in adults [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients .
Non - small Cell Lung Cancer In a study conducted in chemotherapy - naive patients with NSCLC ( TAX326 ) , 148 patients ( 36 % ) in the docetaxel injection + cisplatin group were 65 years of age or greater .
There were 128 patients ( 32 % ) in the vinorelbine + cisplatin group 65 years of age or greater .
In the docetaxel injection + cisplatin group , patients less than 65 years of age had a median survival of 10 . 3 months ( 95 % CI : 9 . 1 months , 11 . 8 months ) and patients 65 years or older had a median survival of 12 . 1 months ( 95 % CI : 9 . 3 months , 14 months ) .
In patients 65 years of age or greater treated with docetaxel injection + cisplatin , diarrhea ( 55 % ) , peripheral edema ( 39 % ) and stomatitis ( 28 % ) were observed more frequently than in the vinorelbine + cisplatin group ( diarrhea 24 % , peripheral edema 20 % , stomatitis 20 % ) .
Patients treated with docetaxel injection + cisplatin who were 65 years of age or greater were more likely to experience diarrhea ( 55 % ) , infections ( 42 % ) , peripheral edema ( 39 % ) and stomatitis ( 28 % ) compared to patients less than the age of 65 administered the same treatment ( 43 % , 31 % , 31 % and 21 % , respectively ) .
When docetaxel injection was combined with carboplatin for the treatment of chemotherapy - naive , advanced non - small cell lung carcinoma , patients 65 years of age or greater ( 28 % ) experienced higher frequency of infection compared to similar patients treated with docetaxel injection + cisplatin , and a higher frequency of diarrhea , infection and peripheral edema than elderly patients treated with vinorelbine + cisplatin .
Prostate Cancer Of the 333 patients treated with docetaxel injection every three weeks plus prednisone in the prostate cancer study ( TAX327 ) , 209 patients were 65 years of age or greater and 68 patients were older than 75 years .
In patients treated with docetaxel injection every three weeks , the following treatment - emergent adverse reactions occurred at rates ≥ 10 % higher in patients 65 years of age or greater compared to younger patients : anemia ( 71 % vs . 59 % ) , infection ( 37 % vs . 24 % ) , nail changes ( 34 % vs . 23 % ) , anorexia ( 21 % vs . 10 % ) , weight loss ( 15 % vs . 5 % ) , respectively .
Breast Cancer In the adjuvant breast cancer trial ( TAX316 ) , docetaxel injection in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide was administered to 744 patients of whom 48 ( 6 % ) were 65 years of age or greater .
The number of elderly patients who received this regimen was not sufficient to determine whether there were differences in safety and efficacy between elderly and younger patients .
Gastric Cancer Among the 221 patients treated with docetaxel injection in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil in the gastric cancer study , 54 were 65 years of age or older and 2 patients were older than 75 years . In this study , the number of patients who were 65 years of age or older was insufficient to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
However , the incidence of serious adverse reactions was higher in the elderly patients compared to younger patients .
The incidence of the following adverse reactions ( all grades , regardless of relationship ) : lethargy , stomatitis , diarrhea , dizziness , edema , febrile neutropenia / neutropenic infection occurred at rates ≥ 10 % higher in patients who were 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients .
Elderly patients treated with TCF should be closely monitored .
Head and Neck Cancer Among the 174 and 251 patients who received the induction treatment with docetaxel injection in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil ( TPF ) for SCCHN in the TAX323 and TAX324 studies , 18 ( 10 % ) and 32 ( 13 % ) of the patients were 65 years of age or older , respectively .
These clinical studies of docetaxel injection in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil in patients with SCCHN did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
Other reported clinical experience with this treatment regimen has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Avoid docetaxel injection in patients with bilirubin > ULN and patients with AST and / or ALT > 1 . 5 x ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase > 2 . 5 x ULN [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The alcohol content of docetaxel injection should be taken into account when given to patients with hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 13 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known antidote for docetaxel injection overdosage .
In case of overdosage , the patient should be kept in a specialized unit where vital functions can be closely monitored .
Anticipated complications of overdosage include : bone marrow suppression , peripheral neurotoxicity , and mucositis .
Patients should receive therapeutic G - CSF as soon as possible after discovery of overdose .
Other appropriate symptomatic measures should be taken , as needed .
In two reports of overdose , one patient received 150 mg / m2 and the other received 200 mg / m2 as 1 - hour infusions .
Both patients experienced severe neutropenia , mild asthenia , cutaneous reactions , and mild paresthesia , and recovered without incident .
In mice , lethality was observed following single intravenous doses that were ≥ 154 mg / kg ( about 4 . 5 times the human dose of 100 mg / m2 on a mg / m2 basis ) ; neurotoxicity associated with paralysis , non - extension of hind limbs , and myelin degeneration was observed in mice at 48 mg / kg ( about 1 . 5 times the human dose of 100 mg / m2 basis ) .
In male and female rats , lethality was observed at a dose of 20 mg / kg ( comparable to the human dose of 100 mg / m2 on a mg / m2 basis ) and was associated with abnormal mitosis and necrosis of multiple organs .
11 DESCRIPTION Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent belonging to the taxoid family .
It is prepared by semisynthesis beginning with a precursor extracted from the renewable needle biomass of yew plants .
The chemical name for docetaxel is ( 2 R , 3 S ) - N - carboxy - 3 - phenylisoserine , N - tert - butyl ester , 13 - ester with 5β - 20 - epoxy - 1 , 2α , 4 , 7β , 10β , 13α - hexahydroxytax - 11 - en - 9 - one 4 - acetate 2 - benzoate .
Docetaxel has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Docetaxel USP is a white to almost - white crystalline powder with molecular formula of C43H53NO14 and a molecular weight of 808 .
It is freely soluble in anhydrous ethanol , soluble in methylene chloride and methanol , practically insoluble in water .
One - vial Docetaxel Injection USP Docetaxel injection USP is a sterile , non - pyrogenic , pale yellow to brownish - yellow solution at 20 mg / mL concentration .
Each mL contains 20 mg docetaxel ( anhydrous ) 3 mg citric acid anhydrous in 0 . 54 grams polysorbate 80 and 0 . 395 grams dehydrated alcohol solution .
The pH of the formulation is 3 to 4 . 5 .
Docetaxel injection USP is available in single - dose vials containing 20 mg ( 1 mL ) or 80 mg ( 4 mL ) docetaxel ( anhydrous ) .
Docetaxel injection USP requires NO prior dilution with a diluent and is ready to add to the infusion solution .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Docetaxel is an antineoplastic agent that acts by disrupting the microtubular network in cells that is essential for mitotic and interphase cellular functions .
Docetaxel binds to free tubulin and promotes the assembly of tubulin into stable microtubules while simultaneously inhibiting their disassembly .
This leads to the production of microtubule bundles without normal function and to the stabilization of microtubules , which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells .
Docetaxel ’ s binding to microtubules does not alter the number of protofilaments in the bound microtubules , a feature which differs from most spindle poisons currently in clinical use .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel has been evaluated in cancer patients after administration of 20 mg / m2 to 115 mg / m2 in phase 1 studies .
The area under the curve ( AUC ) was dose proportional following doses of 70 mg / m2 to 115 mg / m2 with infusion times of 1 to 2 hours .
Docetaxel ’ s pharmacokinetic profile is consistent with a three - compartment pharmacokinetic model , with half - lives for the α , β , and γ phases of 4 min , 36 min , and 11 . 1 hr , respectively .
Mean total body clearance was 21 L / h / m2 .
Distribution The initial rapid decline represents distribution to the peripheral compartments and the late ( terminal ) phase is due , in part , to a relatively slow efflux of docetaxel from the peripheral compartment .
Mean steady state volume of distribution was 113 L .
In vitro studies showed that docetaxel is about 94 % protein bound , mainly to α1 - acid glycoprotein , albumin , and lipoproteins .
In three cancer patients , the in vitro binding to plasma proteins was found to be approximately 97 % .
Dexamethasone does not affect the protein binding of docetaxel .
Metabolism In vitro drug interaction studies revealed that docetaxel is metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme , and its metabolism may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce , inhibit , or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Elimination A study of 14 C - docetaxel was conducted in three cancer patients .
Docetaxel was eliminated in both the urine and feces following oxidative metabolism of the tert - butyl ester group , but fecal excretion was the main elimination route .
Within 7 days , urinary and fecal excretion accounted for approximately 6 % and 75 % of the administered radioactivity , respectively .
About 80 % of the radioactivity recovered in feces is excreted during the first 48 hours as 1 major and 3 minor metabolites with very small amounts ( less than 8 % ) of unchanged drug .
Specific Populations Effect of Age : A population pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out after docetaxel injection treatment of 535 patients dosed at 100 mg / m2 .
Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated by this analysis were very close to those estimated from phase 1 studies .
The pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was not influenced by age .
Effect of Gender : The population pharmacokinetics analysis described above also indicated that gender did not influence the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel .
Hepatic Impairment : The population pharmacokinetic analysis described above indicated that in patients with clinical chemistry data suggestive of mild to moderate liver impairment ( AST and / or ALT > 1 . 5 times ULN concomitant with alkaline phosphatase > 2 . 5 times ULN ) , total body clearance was lowered by an average of 27 % , resulting in a 38 % increase in systemic exposure ( AUC ) .
This average , however , includes a substantial range and there is , at present , no measurement that would allow recommendation for dose adjustment in such patients .
Patients with combined abnormalities of transaminase and alkaline phosphatase should not be treated with docetaxel injection .
Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been studied [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Effect of Race : Mean total body clearance for Japanese patients dosed at the range of 10 mg / m2 to 90 mg / m2 was similar to that of European / American populations dosed at 100 mg / m2 , suggesting no significant difference in the elimination of docetaxel in the two populations .
Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Ketoconazole : The effect of ketoconazole ( a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ) on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel was investigated in 7 cancer patients .
Patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel ( 100 mg / m ² intravenous ) alone or docetaxel ( 10 mg / m ² intravenous ) in combination with ketoconazole ( 200 mg orally once daily for 3 days ) in a crossover design with a 3 - week washout period .
The results of this study indicated that the mean dose - normalized AUC of docetaxel was increased 2 . 2 - fold and its clearance was reduced by 49 % when docetaxel was coadministration with ketoconazole [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) and Drug - Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Effect of combination therapies : • Dexamethasone : Docetaxel total body clearance was not modified by pretreatment with dexamethasone .
• Cisplatin : Clearance of docetaxel in combination therapy with cisplatin was similar to that previously observed following monotherapy with docetaxel .
The pharmacokinetic profile of cisplatin in combination therapy with docetaxel was similar to that observed with cisplatin alone .
• Cisplatin and Fluorouracil : The combined administration of docetaxel , cisplatin and fluorouracil in 12 patients with solid tumors had no influence on the pharmacokinetics of each individual drug .
• Prednisone : A population pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma data from 40 patients with metastatic castration - resistant prostate cancer indicated that docetaxel systemic clearance in combination with prednisone is similar to that observed following administration of docetaxel alone .
• Cyclophosphamide and Doxorubicin : A study was conducted in 30 patients with advanced breast cancer to determine the potential for drug - drug - interactions between docetaxel ( 75 mg / m ² ) , doxorubicin ( 50 mg / m ² ) , and cyclophosphamide ( 500 mg / m ² ) when administered in combination .
The coadministration of docetaxel had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide when the three drugs were given in combination compared to coadministration of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide only .
In addition , doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide had no effect on docetaxel plasma clearance when the three drugs were given in combination compared to historical data for docetaxel monotherapy .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with docetaxel have not been performed .
Docetaxel was clastogenic in the in vitro chromosome aberration test in CHO - K1 cells and in the in vivo micronucleus test in mice administered doses of 0 . 39 to 1 . 56 mg / kg ( about 1 / 60 th to 1 / 15 th the recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Docetaxel was not mutagenic in the Ames test or the CHO / HGPRT gene mutation assays .
Docetaxel did not reduce fertility in rats when administered in multiple intravenous doses of up to 0 . 3 mg / kg ( about 1 / 50 th the recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) , but decreased testicular weights were reported .
This correlates with findings of a 10 - cycle toxicity study ( dosing once every 21 days for 6 months ) in rats and dogs in which testicular atrophy or degeneration was observed at intravenous doses of 5 mg / kg in rats and 0 . 375 mg / kg in dogs ( about 1 / 3 rd and 1 / 15 th the recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis , respectively ) .
An increased frequency of dosing in rats produced similar effects at lower dose levels .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Locally Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer The efficacy and safety of docetaxel injection have been evaluated in locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer after failure of previous chemotherapy ( alkylating agent - containing regimens or anthracycline - containing regimens ) .
Randomized Trials Randomized Trials In one randomized trial , patients with a history of prior treatment with an anthracycline containing regimen were assigned to treatment with docetaxel injection ( 100 mg / m2 every 3 weeks ) or the combination of mitomycin ( 12 mg / m2 every 6 weeks ) and vinblastine ( 6 mg / m2 every 3 weeks ) .
Two hundred three patients were randomized to docetaxel injection and 189 to the comparator arm .
Most patients had received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease ; only 27 patients on the docetaxel injection arm and 33 patients on the comparator arm entered the study following relapse after adjuvant therapy .
Three - quarters of patients had measurable , visceral metastases .
The primary endpoint was time to progression .
The following table summarizes the study results .
( See Table 12 ) .

In a second randomized trial , patients previously treated with an alkylating - containing regimen were assigned to treatment with docetaxel injection ( 100 mg / m2 ) or doxorubicin ( 75 mg / m2 ) every 3 weeks .
One hundred sixty - one patients were randomized to docetaxel injection and 165 patients to doxorubicin .
Approximately one - half of patients had received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease , and one - half entered the study following relapse after adjuvant therapy .
Three - quarters of patients had measurable , visceral metastases . The primary endpoint was time to progression .
The study results are summarized below .
( See Table 13 ) .

In another multicenter open - label , randomized trial ( TAX313 ) , in the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer who progressed or relapsed after one prior chemotherapy regimen , 527 patients were randomized to receive docetaxel injection monotherapy 60 mg / m2 ( n = 151 ) , 75 mg / m2 ( n = 188 ) or 100 mg / m2 ( n = 188 ) .
In this trial , 94 % of patients had metastatic disease and 79 % had received prior anthracycline therapy .
Response rate was the primary endpoint .
Response rates increased with docetaxel injection dose : 19 . 9 % for the 60 mg / m2 group compared to 22 . 3 % for the 75 mg / m2 and 29 . 8 % for the 100 mg / m2 group ; pair - wise comparison between the 60 mg / m2 and 100 mg / m2 groups was statistically significant ( p = 0 . 037 ) .
Single Arm Studies Docetaxel injection at a dose of 100 mg / m2 was studied in six single arm studies involving a total of 309 patients with metastatic breast cancer in whom previous chemotherapy had failed .
Among these , 190 patients had anthracycline - resistant breast cancer , defined as progression during an anthracycline - containing chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease , or relapse during an anthracycline - containing adjuvant regimen .
In anthracycline - resistant patients , the overall response rate was 37 . 9 % ( 72 / 190 ; 95 % C . I . 31 to 44 . 8 ) and the complete response rate was 2 . 1 % .
Docetaxel injection was also studied in three single arm Japanese studies at a dose of 60 mg / m2 , in 174 patients who had received prior chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer .
Among 26 patients whose best response to an anthracycline had been progression , the response rate was 34 . 6 % ( 95 % C . I . 17 . 2 to 55 . 7 ) , similar to the response rate in single arm studies of 100 mg / m2 .
14 . 2 Adjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer A multicenter , open - label , randomized trial ( TAX316 ) evaluated the efficacy and safety of docetaxel injection for the adjuvant treatment of patients with axillary - node - positive breast cancer and no evidence of distant metastatic disease .
After stratification according to the number of positive lymph nodes ( 1 to 3 , 4 + ) , 1491 patients were randomized to receive either docetaxel injection 75 mg / m2 administered 1 - hour after doxorubicin 50 mg / m2 and cyclophosphamide 500 mg / m2 ( TAC arm ) , or doxorubicin 50 mg / m2 followed by fluorouracil 500 mg / m2 and cyclosphosphamide 500 mg / m2 ( FAC arm ) .
Both regimens were administered every 3 weeks for 6 cycles .
Docetaxel injection was administered as a 1 - hour infusion ; all other drugs were given as intravenous bolus on day 1 .
In both arms , after the last cycle of chemotherapy , patients with positive estrogen and / or progesterone receptors received tamoxifen 20 mg daily for up to 5 years .
Adjuvant radiation therapy was prescribed according to guidelines in place at participating institutions and was given to 69 % of patients who received TAC and 72 % of patients who received FAC .
Results from a second interim analysis ( median follow - up 55 months ) are as follows : In study TAX316 , the docetaxel - containing combination regimen TAC showed significantly longer disease - free survival ( DFS ) than FAC ( hazard ratio = 0 . 74 ; 2 - sided 95 % CI = 0 . 60 , 0 . 92 , stratified log rank p = 0 . 0047 ) .
The primary endpoint , disease - free survival , included local and distant recurrences , contralateral breast cancer and deaths from any cause .
The overall reduction in risk of relapse was 25 . 7 % for TAC - treated patients .
( See Figure 1 ) .
At the time of this interim analysis , based on 219 deaths , overall survival was longer for TAC than FAC ( hazard ratio = 0 . 69 , 2 sided 95 % CI = 0 . 53 , 0 . 90 ) .
( See Figure 2 ) .
There will be further analysis at the time survival data mature .
Figure 1 : TAX316 Disease Free Survival K - M curve [ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 2 : TAX316 Overall Survival K - M Curve [ MULTIMEDIA ] The following table describes the results of subgroup analyses for DFS and OS ( see Table 14 ) .

14 . 3 Non - small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) The efficacy and safety of docetaxel injection has been evaluated in patients with unresectable , locally advanced or metastatic non - small cell lung cancer whose disease has failed prior platinum - based chemotherapy or in patients who are chemotherapy - naïve .
Monotherapy with Docetaxel Injection for NSCLC Previously Treated with Platinum - Based Chemotherapy Two randomized , controlled trials established that a docetaxel injection dose of 75 mg / m2 was tolerable and yielded a favorable outcome in patients previously treated with platinum - based chemotherapy ( see below ) .
Docetaxel injection at a dose of 100 mg / m2 , however , was associated with unacceptable hematologic toxicity , infections , and treatment - related mortality and this dose should not be used [ see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
One trial ( TAX317 ) , randomized patients with locally advanced or metastatic non - small cell lung cancer , a history of prior platinum - based chemotherapy , no history of taxane exposure , and an ECOG performance status ≤ 2 to docetaxel injection or best supportive care .
The primary endpoint of the study was survival .
Patients were initially randomized to docetaxel injection 100 mg / m2 or best supportive care , but early toxic deaths at this dose led to a dose reduction to docetaxel injection 75 mg / m2 .
A total of 104 patients were randomized in this amended study to either docetaxel injection 75 mg / m2 or best supportive care .
In a second randomized trial ( TAX320 ) , 373 patients with locally advanced or metastatic non - small cell lung cancer , a history of prior platinum - based chemotherapy , and an ECOG performance status ≤ 2 were randomized to docetaxel injection 75 mg / m2 , docetaxel injection 100 mg / m2 and a treatment in which the investigator chose either vinorelbine 30 mg / m2 days 1 , 8 , and 15 repeated every 3 weeks or ifosfamide 2 g / m2 days 1 to 3 repeated every 3 weeks .
Forty percent of the patients in this study had a history of prior paclitaxel exposure .
The primary endpoint was survival in both trials .
The efficacy data for the docetaxel injection 75 mg / m2 arm and the comparator arms are summarized in Table 15 and Figures 3 and 4 showing the survival curves for the two studies .

Only one of the two trials ( TAX317 ) showed a clear effect on survival , the primary endpoint ; that trial also showed an increased rate of survival to one year .
In the second study ( TAX320 ) the rate of survival at one year favored docetaxel injection 75 mg / m2 .
Figure 3 : TAX317 Survival K - M Curves - Docetaxel Injection 75 mg / m2 Versus Best SupportiveCare [ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 4 : TAX320 Survival K - M Curves - Docetaxel Injection 75 mg / m2 Versus Vinorelbine or Ifosfamide Control [ MULTIMEDIA ] Patients treated with docetaxel injection at a dose of 75 mg / m2 experienced no deterioration in performance status and body weight relative to the comparator arms used in these trials .
Combination Therapy with Docetaxel Injection for Chemotherapy - Naive NSCLC In a randomized controlled trial ( TAX326 ) , 1218 patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and no prior chemotherapy were randomized to receive one of three treatments : Docetaxel injection 75 mg / m2 as a 1 hour infusion immediately followed by cisplatin 75 mg / m2 over 30 to 60 minutes every 3 weeks ; vinorelbine 25 mg / m2 administered over 6 to 10 minutes on days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 followed by cisplatin 100 mg / m2 administered on day 1 of cycles repeated every 4 weeks ; or a combination of docetaxel injection and carboplatin .
The primary efficacy endpoint was overall survival .
Treatment with docetaxel injection + cisplatin did not result in a statistically significantly superior survival compared to vinorelbine + cisplatin ( see table below ) .
The 95 % confidence interval of the hazard ratio ( adjusted for interim analysis and multiple comparisons ) shows that the addition of docetaxel injection to cisplatin results in an outcome ranging from a 6 % inferior to a 26 % superior survival compared to the addition of vinorelbine to cisplatin .
The results of a further statistical analysis showed that at least ( the lower bound of the 95 % confidence interval ) 62 % of the known survival effect of vinorelbine when added to cisplatin ( about a 2 - month increase in median survival ; Wozniak et al .
JCO , 1998 ) was maintained .
The efficacy data for the docetaxel injection + cisplatin arm and the comparator arm are summarized in Table 16 .

A hazard ratio of less than 1 indicates that docetaxel injection + cisplatin is associated with a longer survival .
cAdjusted for interim analysis and multiple comparisons .
The second comparison in the same three - arm study , vinorelbine + cisplatin versus docetaxel injection + carboplatin , did not demonstrate superior survival associated with the docetaxel injection arm ( Kaplan - Meier estimate of median survival was 9 . 1 months for docetaxel injection + carboplatin compared to 10 months on the vinorelbine + cisplatin arm ) and the docetaxel injection + carboplatin arm did not demonstrate preservation of at least 50 % of the survival effect of vinorelbine added to cisplatin .
Secondary endpoints evaluated in the trial included objective response and time to progression .
There was no statistically significant difference between docetaxel injection + cisplatin and vinorelbine + cisplatin with respect to objective response and time to progression ( see Table 17 ) .

14 . 4 Castration - Resistant Prostate Cancer The safety and efficacy of docetaxel injection in combination with prednisone in patients with metastatic castration - resistant prostate cancer were evaluated in a randomized multicenter active control trial .
A total of 1006 patients with Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) ≥ 60 were randomized to the following treatment groups : • Docetaxel injection 75 mg / m2 every 3 weeks for 10 cycles .

Figure 5 : TAX327 Survival K - M Curves [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 5 Gastric Adenocarcinoma A multicenter , open - label , randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of docetaxel injection for the treatment of patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma , including adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction , who had not received prior chemotherapy for advanced disease .
A total of 445 patients with KPS > 70 were treated with either docetaxel injection ( T ) ( 75 mg / m2 on day 1 ) in combination with cisplatin ( C ) ( 75 mg / m2 on day 1 ) and fluorouracil ( F ) ( 750 mg / m2 per day for 5 days ) or cisplatin ( 100 mg / m2 on day 1 ) and fluorouracil ( 1000 mg / m2 per day for 5 days ) .
The length of a treatment cycle was 3 weeks for the TCF arm and 4 weeks for the CF arm .
The demographic characteristics were balanced between the two treatment arms .
The median age was 55 years , 71 % were male , 71 % were Caucasian , 24 % were 65 years of age or older , 19 % had a prior curative surgery and 12 % had palliative surgery .
The median number of cycles administered per patient was 6 ( with a range of 1 to 16 ) for the TCF arm compared to 4 ( with a range of 1 to 12 ) for the CF arm .
Time to progression ( TTP ) was the primary endpoint and was defined as time from randomization to disease progression or death from any cause within 12 weeks of the last evaluable tumor assessment or within 12 weeks of the first infusion of study drugs for patients with no evaluable tumor assessment after randomization .
The hazard ratio ( HR ) for TTP was 1 . 47 ( CF / TCF , 95 % CI : 1 . 19 to 1 . 83 ) with a significantly longer TTP ( p = 0 . 0004 ) in the TCF arm .
Approximately 75 % of patients had died at the time of this analysis .
Overall survival was significantly longer ( p = 0 . 0201 ) in the TCF arm with a HR of 1 . 29 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 04 to 1 . 61 ) .
Efficacy results are summarized in Table 19 and Figures 6 and 7 .

In this study , 358 patients with inoperable locally advanced SCCHN , and WHO performance status 0 or 1 , were randomized to one of two treatment arms .
Patients on the docetaxel injection arm received docetaxel injection ( T ) 75 mg / m2 followed by cisplatin ( P ) 75 mg / m2 on Day 1 , followed by fluorouracil ( F ) 750 mg / m2 per day as a continuous infusion on Days 1 to 5 .
The cycles were repeated every three weeks for 4 cycles .
Patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy ( RT ) according to institutional guidelines ( TPF / RT ) .
Patients on the comparator arm received cisplatin ( P ) 100 mg / m2 on Day 1 , followed by fluorouracil ( F ) 1000 mg / m2 / day as a continuous infusion on Days 1 to 5 .
The cycles were repeated every three weeks for 4 cycles . Patients whose disease did not progress received RT according to institutional guidelines ( PF / RT ) .
At the end of chemotherapy , with a minimal interval of 4 weeks and a maximal interval of 7 weeks , patients whose disease did not progress received radiotherapy ( RT ) according to institutional guidelines .
Locoregional therapy with radiation was delivered either with a conventional fraction regimen ( 1 . 8 Gy to 2 Gy once a day , 5 days per week for a total dose of 66 to 70 Gy ) or with an accelerated / hyperfractionated regimen ( twice a day , with a minimum interfraction interval of 6 hours , 5 days per week , for a total dose of 70 to 74 Gy , respectively ) .
Surgical resection was allowed following chemotherapy , before or after radiotherapy .
The primary endpoint in this study , progression - free survival ( PFS ) , was significantly longer in the TPF arm compared to the PF arm , p = 0 . 0077 ( median PFS : 11 . 4 vs . 8 . 3 months respectively ) with an overall median follow up time of 33 . 7 months .
Median overall survival with a median follow - up of 51 . 2 months was also significantly longer in favor of the TPF arm compared to the PF arm ( median OS : 18 . 6 vs . 14 . 2 months respectively ) .

In this study , 501 patients , with locally advanced SCCHN , and a WHO performance status of 0 or 1 , were randomized to one of two treatment arms .
Patients on the docetaxel injection arm received docetaxel injection ( T ) 75 mg / m ² by intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by cisplatin ( P ) 100 mg / m ² administered as a 30 - minute to three - hour intravenous infusion , followed by the continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil ( F ) 1000 mg / m ² / day from day 1 to day 4 .
The cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles .
Patients on the comparator arm received cisplatin ( P ) 100 mg / m ² as a 30 minute to three - hour intravenous infusion on day 1 followed by the continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil ( F ) 1000 mg / m ² / day from day 1 to day 5 .
The cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for 3 cycles .
All patients in both treatment arms who did not have progressive disease were to receive 7 weeks of chemoradiotherapy ( CRT ) following induction chemotherapy 3 to 8 weeks after the start of the last cycle .
During radiotherapy , carboplatin ( AUC 1 . 5 ) was given weekly as a one - hour intravenous infusion for a maximum of 7 doses .
Radiation was delivered with megavoltage equipment using once daily fractionation ( 2 Gy per day , 5 days per week for 7 weeks for a total dose of 70 to 72 Gy ) .
Surgery on the primary site of disease and / or neck could be considered at anytime following completion of CRT .
The primary efficacy endpoint , overall survival ( OS ) , was significantly longer ( log - rank test , p = 0 . 0058 ) with the docetaxel injection - containing regimen compared to PF [ median OS : 70 . 6 versus 30 . 1 months respectively , hazard ratio ( HR ) = 0 . 70 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 0 . 54 to 0 . 90 ] .
