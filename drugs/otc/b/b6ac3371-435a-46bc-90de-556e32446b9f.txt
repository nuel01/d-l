8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Temporarily discontinue breastfeeding .
A lactating woman should pump and discard breastmilk for 12 to 24 hours after Technetium Tc 99 m Exametazime labeled leukocyte administration .
( 8 . 2 ) • Renal impairment : Increased radiation exposure in patients with impaired renal function .
A reduction in administered Tc 99 m can be considered provided adequate numbers of labeled WBCs are administered ( 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with technetium Tc 99 m exametazime use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage .
Technetium Tc 99 m exametazime is transferred across the placenta [ see Data ] .
Animal reproduction studies with technetium Tc 99 m exametazime have not been conducted .
However , all radiopharmaceuticals have the potential to cause fetal harm depending on the fetal stage of development and the magnitude of the radiation dose .
If considering technetium Tc 99 m exametazime administration to a pregnant woman , inform the patient about the potential for adverse pregnancy outcomes based on the radiation dose from technetium Tc 99 m exametazime and the gestational timing of exposure .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data Limited published literature describes Tc - 99 m exametazime crossing the placental barrier and accumulating in the fetal liver .
No adverse fetal effects or radiation - related risks have been identified for diagnostic procedures involving less than 50 mGy , which represents less than 10 mGy fetal doses .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are limited data available in the scientific literature on the presence of technetium Tc 99 m exametazime in human milk .
There no data available on the effects of technetium Tc 99 m exametazime on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production .
Exposure of technetium Tc 99 m exametazine to a breast fed infant can be minimized by temporary discontinuation of breastfeeding [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for technetium Tc 99 m exametazime , any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from technetium Tc 99 m exametazime or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations To decrease radiation exposure to the breastfed infant , advise a lactating woman to pump and discard breast milk after the administration of technetium Tc 99 m exametazime - labeled leukocytes for 12 to 24 hours , where the duration corresponds to the typical range of administered activity , 259 MBq to 925 MBq ( 7 mCi to 25 mCi ) .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been assessed .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Tc 99 m exametazime did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Technetium Tc 99 m exametazime is substantially excreted by the kidneys , so excretion is decreased / delayed and therefore radiation exposure is greater in patients with impaired renal function .
A reduction in administered Tc 99 m can be considered provided an adequate number of labeled WBCs are administered .
10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of the administration of a radiation overdose , hydration and frequent micturition should be encouraged in order to minimize the absorbed dose to patient .
11 DESCRIPTION 11 . 1 Chemical Characteristics Drax Exametazime ( kit for the preparation of technetium Tc 99 m exametazime for leukocyte labeling ) prepares a radioactive diagnostic agent .
Each single - dose vial contains a sterile , non - pyrogenic , lyophilized mixture of 0 . 5 mg exametazime , 7 . 6 mcg stannous chloride dihydrate ( minimum stannous tin 0 . 6 mcg ; maximum total stannous and stannic tin 4 mcg per vial ) and 4 . 5 mg sodium chloride , sealed under nitrogen atmosphere with a rubber closure .
The product contains no antimicrobial preservative .
The chemical formula of exametazime is C13H28N4O2 , with the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Prior to publication of the USAN , exametazime [ also known as ( RR , SS ) - 4 . 8 - diaza - 3 , 6 , 6 , 9 - tetramethylundecane - 2 , 10 - dione bisoxime ] was known as hexamethylpropylene amine oxime ( HM - PAO ) .
The name HM - PAO appears in many publications .
When Tc 99 m pertechnetate in Sodium Chloride Injection , USP ( 0 . 9 % ) is added to Drax Exametazime vial , a Tc 99 m complex of exametazime is formed .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 11 . 2 Physical Characteristics Tc 99 m decays by isomeric transition with a physical half - life of 6 hours .
Photons that are useful for imaging studies are listed in Table 2 .
Table 2 Principal Radiation Emission Data - Tc 99 mRadiation Mean % / Disintegration Mean Energy ( keV ) Gamma 2 88 . 5 140 . 5 11 . 3 External Radiation The air - kerma - rate ( exposure - rate ) constant for technetium Tc 99 m is 5 . 23 m2 · pGy · ( MBq ) - 1 · s - 1 [ 0 . 795 cm2 · R · ( mCi ) - 1 · h - 1 ] .
The first half - value thickness of lead ( Pb ) for Tc 99 m is 0 . 25 mm .
A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 3 .
For example , the use of a 3 mm thickness of Pb will decrease the external radiation exposure by a factor of approximately 1 , 000 .

This lipophilic complex is the active moiety .
The lipophilic technetium Tc 99 m exametazime complex is taken up and retained in leukocytes .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The relationship between technetium Tc 99 m exametazime labeled WBC concentrations and successful imaging was not explored in clinical trials .
GI activity is typically not seen through the initial four ( 4 ) hours post - injection .
By four ( 4 ) hours , the hepatobiliary excretion of the Tc 99 m exametazime allows tracer ( Tc 99 m ) accumulation in the hepatobiliary system and , hence bowel activity .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution During the first hour following the injection , radioactivity is seen in the lungs , liver , gall bladder , spleen , blood pool , bone marrow , kidneys , and bladder .
Over the first 1 - 6 hours , the Tc 99 m is visualized in the bowel .
At 24 hours post - injection substantial colonic activity is seen .
The normal areas visualized in earlier scans are still visible .
Elimination Excretion Tc 99 m excretion occurs via urine and feces .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two clinical trials of technetium Tc 99 m exametazime were performed in a total of 88 patients who had suspected intra - abdominal infection or inflammation .
Subjects received both Tc 99 m labeled leukocytes and a radiolabeled comparator .
Images were obtained at 2 and 30 minutes and at 2 , 4 and 24 hours .
In two other clinical trials , a total of 127 patients with suspected abdominal inflammation or infection received Tc 99 m labeled leukocytes .
Imaging was at 24 hours in one study and at 1 , 3 and 24 hours in the other .
In all four studies images were blindly evaluated and the findings were confirmed by surgery , biopsy or other clinical data .
Based on the above 4 studies , between 2 to 4 hours Tc 99 m labeled leukocytes had 95 - 100 % sensitivity and 62 - 85 % specificity .
In all studies the false positive and false negatives relate to the bowel background , the location of the site of infection / inflammation and whether or not it is contiguous with the bowel .
Images obtained at 24 hours can be unreliable because of a high bowel background .
The interpretation of the images could also be affected by the presence of tumors , infarction and peritonitis [ See Warning and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Liver abscess may be missed in planar imaging because of the bowel background .
