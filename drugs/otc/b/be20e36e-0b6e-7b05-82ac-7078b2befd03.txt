[ 1 ] 1 . 2 Hypoalbuminemia For subjects with hypoalbuminemia who are critically ill and / or are bleeding actively , ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % infusions may be indicated .
[ 3 ] When albumin deficit is the result of excessive protein loss , the effect of administration of ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % will be temporary unless the underlying disorder is reversed .
1 . 3 Prevention of Central Volume Depletion after Paracentesis due to Cirrhotic Ascites ( Treatment Adjunct ) ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % may be used to maintain cardiovascular function following the removal of large volumes of ascitic fluid after paracentesis due to cirrhotic ascites .
[ 2 ] 1 . 4 Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome ( OHSS ) ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % may be used as a plasma expander in fluid management relating to severe forms of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) .
[ 7 , 8 ] 1 . 5 Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) ( Treatment Adjunct ) ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % infusions may be indicated in conjunction with diuretics to correct the fluid volume overload associated with ARDS .

( 16 ) Do not freeze .
( 16 ) If large volumes ( greater than 1500 ml ) are administered , warm the product to room temperature before use .
( 2 . 2 ) Bottles are for single use only .
( 2 . 2 ) 2 . 1 Dosage General Recommendations The concentration of the albumin preparation , dosage and the infusion rate should be adjusted to the patient ’ s individual requirements .
The dose required depends on the body weight of the patient , the severity of trauma or illness and on continuing fluid and protein losses .
Measures of adequacy of circulating volume and not plasma albumin levels should be used to determine the dose required .
The daily dose should not exceed 2 g of ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % per kg of body weight .
Hypovolemia In adults , an intravenous infusion of 25 g should be given .
If adequate response ( stabilization of circulation ) is not achieved within 15 to 30 minutes , an additional dose may be given .
In spite of limited information about the efficacy in pediatric subjects , an intravenous infusion of 2 . 5 to 12 . 5 g or 0 . 5 to 1 g / kg body weight may be given .
If adequate response ( stabilization of circulation ) is not achieved within 15 to 30 minutes , an additional dose may be given .
Hemodilution may follow administration of ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % .
If hemorrhage has occurred , this may result in relative anemia .
This condition should be controlled by the supplemental administration of compatible red blood cells or compatible whole blood .
Hypoalbuminemia In adults , intravenous infusion of 50 to 75 g of ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % may be used .
Hypoalbuminemia is usually accompanied by a hidden extravascular albumin deficiency of equal magnitude .
This total body albumin deficit must be considered when determining the amount of albumin necessary to reverse the hypoalbuminemia .
In burns , therapy usually starts with the administration of large volumes of crystalloid injection to maintain plasma volume .
After 24 hours , ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % may be added at an initial dose of 25 g with the dose adjusted thereafter to maintain a plasma protein concentration of 2 . 5 g per 100 mL or a serum protein concentration of 5 . 2 g / 100 mL .
Prevention of Central Volume Depletion after Paracentesis due to Cirrhotic Ascites In adults , intravenous infusion of 8 g of ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % may be given for every 1 , 000 mL of ascitic fluid removed .
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome In adults , as a guideline , doses of 50 – 100 g of ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % should be infused over 4 hours and repeated at 4 - to 12 - hour intervals as necessary , when infusion of normal saline fails to achieve or maintain hemodynamic stability and urine output .
[ 7 ] Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) In adults , a dose of 25 g of ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % can be infused over 30 minutes and repeated at 8 hour intervals for 3 days , if necessary .
[ 5 ] Induction of Diuresis in Patients with Acute Nephrosis In adults , a dose of 25 g of ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % can be infused , administered with an appropriate diuretic once a day for 7 to 10 days .
Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % may be administered prior to or during exchange transfusion at a dose of 1 g per kilogram body weight .
[ 6 ] 2 . 2 Administration Intravenous use only .

11 DESCRIPTION ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % is a sterile , liquid preparation of albumin derived from large pools of human plasma .
All units of human plasma used in the manufacture of ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % are provided by FDA approved blood establishments only .
The product is manufactured by cold ethanol fractionation followed by ultra - and diafiltration .
The manufacturing process includes final container pasteurization and additional bulk pasteurization at 60 + / - 0 . 5 ° C for 10 – 11 hours .
The ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % manufacturing process provides a significant viral reduction in in vitro studies ( table 3 ) .
These reductions are achieved through a combination of process steps including Cohn fractionation and final container pasteurization .
No procedure , however , has been shown to be completely effective in removing viral infectivity from derivatives of human plasma .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY No pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies with ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % have been conducted .
12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Albumin is responsible for 75 - 80 % of the colloid osmotic pressure of normal plasma .
Albumin stabilizes circulating blood volume and is a carrier of hormones , enzymes , medicinal products and toxins .
[ 3 ] Albumin is a protein with a total extravascular mass of approximately 160 g and an intravascular mass of about 120 g . [ 3 ] 12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The colloid osmotic effect of ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 20 % and 25 % is approximately 5 times the volume administered .
When injected intravenously , it will increase circulating plasma volume by approximately 3 . 5 times the volume infused within 15 minutes if the patient is adequately hydrated .
This extra fluid reduces hemoconcentration and blood viscosity .
The degree and duration of volume expansion depends upon the initial blood volume .
When treating patients with diminished blood volume , the effect of infused albumin may persist for many hours .
The hemodilution lasts for a shorter time when albumin is administered to individuals with normal blood volume .
[ 4 ] 13 NON - CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY No non - clinical toxicology studies with ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % have been conducted .
Human Albumin is a normal constituent of human plasma and acts like physiological albumin .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES A multicenter , prospective , double - blind , parallel group study with two cohorts was conducted , comparing efficacy and safety of ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % with a licensed competitor product in preventing central volume depletion after paracentesis due to cirrhotic ascites .
Cohort A received treatment with albumin after consecutive paracentesis ( multiple dose treatment ) , whereas cohort B received treatment with albumin after single paracentesis ( single dose treatment ) .
In total 17 subjects ( 12 males , 5 females ; median age 53 years , range 35 - 75 ) were enrolled ( 11 in cohort A , 6 in cohort B ) .
10 subjects received ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % infusions and 7 subjects received the competitor drug .
The maximum exposure was 3 infusions ( 5 subjects in the ALBUMIN ( HUMAN ) 25 % treatment group and 4 subjects in the comparator group ) .
The dose administered was 8 grams of study product for every 1000 mL of ascites removed .
Evaluation of efficacy was based on changes from baseline of Blood Urea Nitrogen ( BUN ) and serum creatinine at Day 1 in cohort A . Weight changes between Day 0 , Day 1 and Day 7 were also compared .
No clinical relevant differences were noted between the two treatment groups with respect to changes in BUN and creatinine levels from baseline to post - treatment .
No clinically relevant changes in body weight were noted between the two treatment groups .
