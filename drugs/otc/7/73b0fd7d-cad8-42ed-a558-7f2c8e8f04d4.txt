( 5 . 6 ) 5 . 1 Hemorrhage Fatal and serious hemorrhage has occurred in patients with hematological malignancies treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy .
Grade 3 or higher hemorrhage including intracranial and gastrointestinal hemorrhage , hematuria , and hemothorax was reported in 3 . 6 % of patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy in clinical trials , with fatalities occurring in 0 . 3 % of patients .
Bleeding of any grade , excluding purpura and petechiae , occurred in 30 % of patients .
Bleeding has occurred in patients with and without concomitant antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy .
Coadministration of BRUKINSA with antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications may further increase the risk of hemorrhage .
Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding .
Discontinue BRUKINSA if intracranial hemorrhage of any grade occurs .
Consider the benefit - risk of withholding BRUKINSA for 3 - 7 days pre and post surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding .
5 . 2 Infections Fatal and serious infections ( including bacterial , viral , or fungal infections ) and opportunistic infections have occurred in patients with hematological malignancies treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy .
Grade 3 or higher infections occurred in 24 % of patients , most commonly pneumonia ( 11 % ) , with fatal infections occurring in 2 . 9 % of patients .
Infections due to hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) reactivation have occurred .
Consider prophylaxis for herpes simplex virus , pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia , and other infections according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for infections .
Monitor and evaluate patients for fever or other signs and symptoms of infection and treat appropriately .
5 . 3 Cytopenias Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias , including neutropenia ( 22 % ) , thrombocytopenia ( 8 % ) , and anemia ( 7 % ) based on laboratory measurements , developed in patients treated with BRUKINSA monotherapy [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 11 % of patients , and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 2 . 8 % of patients .

SEQUOIA The safety of BRUKINSA monotherapy in patients with previously untreated CLL / SLL was evaluated in a randomized , multicenter , open - label , actively controlled trial [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
Patients without deletion of chromosome 17p13 . 1 ( 17 p deletion ) ( Cohort 1 ) received either BRUKINSA 160 mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity ( n = 240 ) or bendamustine plus rituximab ( BR ) for 6 cycles ( n = 227 ) .
Bendamustine was dosed at 90 mg / m2 / day intravenously on the first 2 days of each cycle , and rituximab was dosed at 375 mg / m2 on day 1 of Cycle 1 and 500 mg / m2 on day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6 .
Additionally , the same BRUKINSA regimen was evaluated in 111 patients with previously untreated CLL / SLL with 17 p deletion in a non - randomized single arm ( Cohort 2 ) .
Randomized cohort : Previously untreated CLL / SLL without 17 p deletion In patients with previously untreated CLL / SLL without 17 p deletion , the median age was 70 , 62 % were male , 89 % were White , 2 % were Asian , and 2 % were Black .
Most patients ( 93 % ) had an ECOG performance status of 0 to 1 .
The median duration of exposure to BRUKINSA was 26 months , with 71 % exposed for more than 2 years .
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 36 % of patients who received BRUKINSA .
Serious adverse reactions that occurred in ≥ 5 % of patients were COVID - 19 , pneumonia , and second primary malignancy ( 5 % each ) .
Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 11 ( 4 . 6 % ) patients with the leading cause of death being COVID - 19 ( 2 . 1 % ) .
Adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of BRUKINSA in 8 % of patients , dose reduction in 8 % , and dose interruption in 46 % .
The most common adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation were second primary malignancy and COVID - 19 .
The leading causes of dose modification ( ≥ 5 % of all patients ) were respiratory infections ( COVID - 19 , pneumonia ) and hemorrhage .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animals , BRUKINSA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women .
There are no available data on BRUKINSA use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of zanubrutinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis was associated with fetal heart malformation at approximately 5 - fold human exposures ( see Data ) .
Women should be advised to avoid pregnancy while taking BRUKINSA .
If BRUKINSA is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking BRUKINSA , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Embryo - fetal development toxicity studies were conducted in both rats and rabbits .
Zanubrutinib was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 30 , 75 , and 150 mg / kg / day .
Malformations in the heart ( 2 or 3 - chambered hearts ) were noted at all dose levels in the absence of maternal toxicity .
The dose of 30 mg / kg / day is approximately 5 times the exposure ( AUC ) in patients receiving the recommended dose of 160 mg twice daily .
Administration of zanubrutinib to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at 30 , 70 , and 150 mg / kg / day resulted in post - implantation loss at the highest dose .
The dose of 150 mg / kg is approximately 32 times the exposure ( AUC ) in patients at the recommended dose and was associated with maternal toxicity .
In a pre and postnatal developmental toxicity study , zanubrutinib was administered orally to rats at doses of 30 , 75 , and 150 mg / kg / day from implantation through weaning .
The offspring from the middle and high dose groups had decreased body weights preweaning , and all dose groups had adverse ocular findings ( e . g . , cataract , protruding eye ) .
The dose of 30 mg / kg / day is approximately 5 times the AUC in patients receiving the recommended dose .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of zanubrutinib or its metabolites in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from BRUKINSA in a breastfed child , advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with BRUKINSA and for two weeks following the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential BRUKINSA can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating BRUKINSA therapy .
Contraception Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BRUKINSA and for 1 week following the last dose of BRUKINSA .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to a fetus .
Males Advise men to avoid fathering a child while receiving BRUKINSA and for 1 week following the last dose of BRUKINSA .

11 DESCRIPTION BRUKINSA ( zanubrutinib ) is a kinase inhibitor .
The empirical formula of zanubrutinib is C27H29N5O3 and the chemical name is ( S ) - 7 - ( 1 - acryloylpiperidin - 4 - yl ) - 2 - ( 4 - phenoxyphenyl ) - 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 - tetrahydropyrazolo [ 1 , 5 - a ] pyrimidine - 3 - carboxamide .
Zanubrutinib is a white to off - white powder , with a pH of 7 . 8 in saturated solution .
The aqueous solubility of zanubrutinib is pH dependent , from very slightly soluble to practically insoluble .
The molecular weight of zanubrutinib is 471 . 55 Daltons .
Zanubrutinib has the following structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Each BRUKINSA capsule for oral administration contains 80 mg zanubrutinib and the following inactive ingredients : colloidal silicon dioxide , croscarmellose sodium , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose and sodium lauryl sulfate .
The capsule shell contains edible black ink , gelatin , and titanium dioxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Zanubrutinib is a small - molecule inhibitor of Bruton ' s tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) .
Zanubrutinib forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active site , leading to inhibition of BTK activity .
BTK is a signaling molecule of the B - cell antigen receptor ( BCR ) and cytokine receptor pathways .
In B - cells , BTK signaling results in activation of pathways necessary for B - cell proliferation , trafficking , chemotaxis and adhesion .
In nonclinical studies , zanubrutinib inhibited malignant B - cell proliferation and reduced tumor growth .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics BTK Occupancy in PBMCs and Lymph Nodes The median steady - state BTK occupancy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was maintained at 100 % over 24 hours at a total daily dose of 320 mg in patients with B - cell malignancies .
The median steady - state BTK occupancy in lymph nodes was 94 % to 100 % following the approved recommended dosage .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At the approved recommended doses ( 160 mg twice daily or 320 mg once daily ) , there were no clinically relevant effects on the QTc interval .
The effect of BRUKINSA on the QTc interval above the therapeutic exposure has not been evaluated .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Zanubrutinib maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) and area under the plasma drug concentration over time curve ( AUC ) increase proportionally over a dosage range from 40 mg to 320 mg ( 0 . 13 to 1 time the recommended total daily dose ) .
Limited systemic accumulation of zanubrutinib was observed following repeated administration .
The geometric mean ( % CV ) zanubrutinib steady - state daily AUC is 2 , 099 ( 42 % ) ng ∙ h / mL following 160 mg twice daily and 1 , 917 ( 59 % ) ng ∙ h / mL following 320 mg once daily .
The geometric mean ( % CV ) zanubrutinib steady - state Cmax is 295 ( 55 % ) ng / mL following 160 mg twice daily and 537 ( 55 % ) ng / mL following 320 mg once daily .
Absorption The median tmax of zanubrutinib is 2 hours .
Effect of Food No clinically significant differences in zanubrutinib AUC or Cmax were observed following administration of a high - fat meal ( approximately 1 , 000 calories with 50 % of total caloric content from fat ) in healthy subjects .
Distribution The geometric mean ( % CV ) apparent volume of distribution ( Vz / F ) of zanubrutinib is 537 ( 73 % ) L .
The plasma protein binding of zanubrutinib is approximately 94 % and the blood - to - plasma ratio is 0 . 7 to 0 . 8 .
Elimination The mean half - life ( t ½ ) of zanubrutinib is approximately 2 to 4 hours following a single oral zanubrutinib dose of 160 mg or 320 mg .
The geometric mean ( % CV ) apparent oral clearance ( CL / F ) of zanubrutinib is 128 ( 58 % ) L / h .
Metabolism Zanubrutinib is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3 A .
Excretion Following a single radiolabeled zanubrutinib dose of 320 mg to healthy subjects , approximately 87 % of the dose was recovered in feces ( 38 % unchanged ) and 8 % in urine ( less than 1 % unchanged ) .
Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of zanubrutinib were observed based on age ( 19 to 90 years ) , sex , race ( Asian , Caucasian , and Other ) , body weight ( 36 to 144 kg ) or mild , moderate or severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance [ CLcr ] ≥ 15 mL / min as estimated by Cockcroft - Gault ) .
The effect of dialysis on zanubrutinib pharmacokinetics is unknown .
Hepatic Impairment The total AUC of zanubrutinib increased by 11 % in subjects with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class A ) , by 21 % in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class B ) , and by 60 % in subjects with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class C ) relative to subjects with normal liver function .
The unbound AUC of zanubrutinib increased by 23 % in subjects with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class A ) , by 43 % in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class B ) and by 194 % in subjects with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class C ) relative to subjects with normal liver function .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with zanubrutinib .
Zanubrutinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenicity ( Ames ) assay , was not clastogenic in a chromosome aberration assay in mammalian ( CHO ) cells , nor was it clastogenic in an in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats .
A combined male and female fertility and early embryonic development study was conducted in rats at oral zanubrutinib doses of 30 to 300 mg / kg / day .
Male rats were dosed 4 weeks prior to mating and through mating and female rats were dosed 2 weeks prior to mating and to gestation day 7 .
No effect on male or female fertility was noted but at the highest dose tested , morphological abnormalities in sperm and increased post - implantation loss were noted .
The high dose of 300 mg / kg / day is approximately 10 times the human recommended dose , based on body surface area .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Mantle Cell Lymphoma The efficacy of BRUKINSA was assessed in BGB - 3111 - 206 [ NCT03206970 ] , a Phase 2 , open - label , multicenter , single - arm trial of 86 previously treated patients with MCL who had received at least one prior therapy .
BRUKINSA was given orally at a dose of 160 mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
The median age of patients was 60 . 5 years ( range : 34 to 75 ) and the majority were male ( 78 % ) .
The median time since diagnosis to study entry was 30 months ( range : 3 to 102 ) and the median number of prior therapies was 2 ( range : 1 to 4 ) .
The most common prior regimens were CHOP - based ( 91 % ) followed by rituximab - based ( 74 % ) .
The majority of patients had extranodal involvement ( 71 % ) and refractory disease ( 52 % ) .
Blastoid variant of MCL was present in 14 % of patients .
The MIPI score was low in 58 % , intermediate in 29 % , and high risk in 13 % .
The efficacy of BRUKINSA was also assessed in BGB - 3111 - AU - 003 [ NCT02343120 ] , a Phase 1 / 2 , open - label , dose - escalation , global , multicenter , single - arm trial of B cell malignancies including 32 previously treated MCL patients treated with BRUKINSA .
BRUKINSA was given orally at doses of 160 mg twice daily or 320 mg daily .
The median age of patients with previously treated MCL was 70 years ( range : 42 to 86 ) and 38 % of patients were ≥ 75 years old .
Most patients were male ( 69 % ) and Caucasian ( 78 % ) .

14 . 2 Waldenström ' s Macroglobulinemia The efficacy of BRUKINSA was evaluated in ASPEN [ NCT03053440 ] , a randomized , active control , open - label trial , comparing BRUKINSA and ibrutinib in patients with MYD88 L265P mutation ( MYD88MUT ) WM . Patients in Cohort 1 ( n = 201 ) were randomized 1 : 1 to receive BRUKINSA 160 mg twice daily or ibrutinib 420 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Randomization was stratified by number of prior therapies ( 0 versus 1 - 3 versus > 3 ) and CXCR4 status ( presence or absence of a WHIM - like mutation as measured by Sanger assay ) .
The major efficacy outcome was the response rate defined as PR or better as assessed by IRC based on standard consensus response criteria from the International Workshop on Waldenström ' s Macroglobulinemia ( IWWM ) - 6 criteria .
An additional efficacy outcome measure was duration of response ( DOR ) .
The median age was 70 years ( range : 38 to 90 ) and 68 % were male .
Of those enrolled , 2 % were Asian , 91 % were White , and 7 % were of unknown race .
ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 was present in 93 % patients at baseline and 7 % had a baseline ECOG performance status of 2 .
A total of 82 % had relapsed / refractory disease with 85 % having received prior alkylating agents and 91 % prior anti - CD20 therapy .
The median number of prior therapies in those with relapsed / refractory disease was 1 ( range : 1 to 8 ) .
A total of 91 ( 45 % ) patients had International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) high WM . The study did not meet statistical significance for the prespecified efficacy outcome of superior CR + VGPR as assessed by IRC , tested first in patients with R / R disease in ASPEN .

14 . 4 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma The efficacy of BRUKINSA in patients with CLL / SLL was evaluated in two randomized controlled trials .
SEQUOIA The efficacy of BRUKINSA in patients with previously untreated CLL / SLL was evaluated in a multicenter , open - label trial ( SEQUOIA ; NCT0333633 ) .
The trial required patients to be unsuitable for FCR therapy defined as either age ≥ 65 years or age 18 to < 65 with a total Cumulative Illness Rating Scale ( CIRS ) > 6 , creatinine clearance 30 to 69 mL / min , or history of serious or recurrent infection .
Patients without 17 p deletion ( 17 p del ) were randomized to receive either BRUKINSA 160 mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity ( n = 241 ) or bendamustine plus rituximab ( BR ) for 6 cycles ( n = 238 ) .
Bendamustine was dosed at 90 mg / m2 / day intravenously on the first 2 days of each cycle , and rituximab was dosed at 375 mg / m2 on day 1 of Cycle 1 and 500 mg / m2 on day 1 of Cycles 2 to 6 with a 28 - day cycle length .
Randomization was stratified by age , Binet stage , immunoglobulin variable region heavy chain ( IGHV ) mutational status , and geographic region .
Additionally , the same BRUKINSA regimen was evaluated in 110 patients with previously untreated , 17 p del CLL / SLL in a non - randomized cohort .
Efficacy is summarized according to cohort .
Randomized cohort : Previously untreated CLL / SLL without 17 p deletion In the randomized cohort of patients with previously untreated CLL / SLL without 17 p deletion , the median age was 70 years ; 62 % were male , 89 % were White , 3 % were Asian , 1 % were Black .
Fifty - three percent of patients had an unmutated IGHV gene and 29 % had Binet Stage C disease .
Baseline characteristics were generally similar between treatment arms .
Efficacy in this cohort was based on progression - free survival as assessed by an IRC .
