DESCRIPTION Each brown soft gelatin capsule contains : Ferrous fumarate ............................................................................
460 mg ( 151 mg elemental iron ) Ascorbic acid .................................................................................... 60 mg Folic acid ............................................................................................
1 mg Cyanocobalamin .............................................................................
10 mcg The amount of elemental iron and the absorption of the iron components of commercial iron preparations vary widely .
It is further established that certain " accessory components " may be included to enhance absorption and utilization of iron .
Hematogen Forte Capsules are formulated to provide the essential factors for a complete , versatile hematinic .
Inactive Ingredients : Soybean oil , Lecithin , Glycerin , hydrogenated soybean oil , Yellow Beewax , Titanium Oxide .
ACTIONS / CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY High Elemental Iron Content : Ferrous fumarate , used in Hematogen Forte Capsules , is an organic iron complex which has the highest elemental iron content of any hematinic salt - 33 % .
This compares with 20 % for 1 , 2 ferrous sulfate ( heptahydrate ) and 13 % for ferrous gluconate .
Hematogen Forte contains 151 mg of elemental iron .
More Complete Absorption : It has been repeatedly shown that ascorbic acid , when given in sufficient amounts , can increase the absorption of ferrous iron from the gastrointestinal tract .
The absorption promoting effect is mainly due to the reducing action of ascorbic acid within the gastrointestinal lumen , 3 which help to prevent or delay the formation of insoluble or less dissociated ferric compounds .
Promotes Movement Of Plasma Iron : Ascorbic acid also plays an important role in the movement of plasma iron to storage depots in the tissues .
The action , which leads to the transport of plasma iron to ferritin , presumably involves its reducing effect , converting transferrin iron from the ferric to the ferrous state .
There is also evidence that ascorbic acid improves iron utilization , presumably as a further result of its reducing action , and some evidence that it may have a direct effect upon erythropoiesis .
Ascorbic acid is further alleged to enhance the conversion of folic acid to a more physiologically active form , folinic acid , which would make it even more important in the treatment of anemia since it would aid in the utilization of dietary folic acid .
Excellent Oral Toleration : Ferrous fumarate is used in Hematogen Forte Capsules because it is less likely to cause the gastric disturbances so often associated with oral iron therapy .
Ferrous fumarate has a low ionization constant and high solubility in the entire pH range of the gastrointestinal tract .
It does not precipitate proteins or have the astringency of more ionizable forms of iron , and does not interfere with proteolytic or diastatic activities of the digestive system .
Because of excellent oral toleration , Hematogen Forte Capsules can usually be administered between meals when iron absorption is maximal .
Folic Acid Supplementation : The use of supplemental folic acid may be indicated in patients with increased requirements for this vitamin , such as iron deficiency anemia .
Folic acid administration may reduce the risk of neural tube defects in the developing fetus .
Folic acid has also been shown to reduce circulating homocysteine levels in the blood .
Folate as methyltetrahydrofolate and B as methylcobalamin are involved in the remethylation reaction of homocysteine to methionine .
Elevated homocysteine plasma levels are associated with increased risk of preeclampsia , neural tube defects , myocardial infarction and atherosclerosis .
Toxicity : Ferrous fumarate was found to be the least toxic of three popular oral iron salts , with an oral LD 50 of 630 mg / kg .
In the same report , the LD of ferrous gluconate was reported to be 320 mg / kg and ferrous sulfate 230 mg / kg .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE For the treatment of all anemias responsive to oral iron therapy , such as hypochromic anemia associated with pregnancy , chronic or acute blood loss , dietary restriction , metabolic disease and post - surgical convalescence .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Hemochromatosis and hemosiderosis are contraindications to iron therapy .
Folic acid is contraindicated in patients with pernicious anemia ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
Soybean oil , Lecithin , Di Calcium phosphate anhydrous , Beeswax yellow , hydrogenated soybean oil .
WARNING WARNING : Accidental overdose of iron - containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6 .
Keep this product out of reach of children .
In case of accidental overdose , call a doctor or poison control center immediately .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Average capsule doses in sensitive individuals or excessive dosage may cause nausea , skin rash , vomiting , diarrhea , precordial pain , or flushing of the face and extremities .
PRECAUTIONS Folic acid should not be prescribed until the diagnosis of pernicious anemia has been eliminated , since it can alleviate the hematologic manifestations , while allowing neurological damage to 23 continue undetected Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients has not been established .
Geriatric Use Clinical studies on this product have not been performed in sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosage range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of noncomitant DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Usual adult dose is 1 - 2 soft gelatin capsules daily , or as directed by a physician .
