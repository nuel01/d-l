( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in patients with : • • known hypersensitivity to dextrose and / or sodium chloride [ see Warnings and Precautions 5 . 1 ) ] • • clinically significant hyperglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • • Known hypersensitivity to dextrose , or sodium chloride ( 4 , 5 . 1 ) • • Clinically significant hyperglycemia ( 4 , 5 . 2 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Hypersensitivity Reactions : Monitor for signs and symptoms and discontinue infusion if reactions occur .
( 5 . 1 ) • • Hyperglycemia or Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State : Monitor blood glucose and administer insulin as needed .
( 5 . 2 , 8 . 4 ) • • Hyponatremia , Hypokalemia , Hypernatremia and Hyperchloremia : Avoid in patients with or at risk for hypo - / hypernatremia and hypokalemia .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor serum sodium and potassium concentrations .
( 5 . 3 , 5 . 4 , 5 . 5 , 8 . 4 ) • • Fluid Overload : Avoid in patients with or at risk for fluid and / or solute overloading .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor daily fluid balance and electrolyte , concentrations and acid - base balance , as needed and especially during prolonged use .
( 5 . 6 ) • • Refeeding Syndrome : Monitor severely undernourished patients and slowly increase nutrient intake .
( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity and infusion reactions , including anaphylaxis , have been reported with Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Stop the infusion immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity or infusion reaction develops [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Appropriate therapeutic countermeasures must be instituted as clinically indicated .
5 . 2 Hyperglycemia and Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State The use of dextrose infusions in patients with impaired glucose tolerance may worsen hyperglycemia .
Administration of dextrose at a rate exceeding the patient ’ s utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia , coma , and death .
Hyperglycemia is associated with an increase in serum osmolality , resulting in osmotic diuresis , dehydration and electrolyte losses .
Patients with underlying central nervous system disease and renal impairment who receive dextrose infusions , may be at greater risk of developing hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state .
Monitor blood glucose concentrations and treat hyperglycemia to maintain concentrations within normal limits while administering Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection .
Insulin may be administered or adjusted to maintain optimal blood glucose concentrations .
5 . 3 Hyponatremia Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection is a hypertonic solution [ see Description , Table 1 ( 11 ) ] .
In the body , however , glucose containing fluids can become extremely physiologically hypotonic due to rapid glucose metabolization .
Monitoring of serum sodium is particularly important for hypotonic fluids .
Depending on the tonicity of the solution , the volume and rate of infusion , and depending on a patient ’ s underlying clinical condition and capability to metabolize glucose , intravenous administration of glucose can cause electrolyte disturbances , most importantly hypo - or hyperosmotic hyponatremia .
The risk for hyponatremia is increased , in pediatric patients , elderly patients , postoperative patients , those with psychogenic polydipsia and in patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia ( such as certain diuretic , antiepileptic and psychotropic medications ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Acute hyponatremia can lead to acute hyponatremic encephalopathy characterized by headache , nausea , seizures , lethargy and vomiting .
Patients with brain edema are at particular risk of severe , irreversible and life - threatening brain injury .
Patients at increased risk for developing complications of hyponatremia , such as hyponatremic encephalopathy include pediatric patients ; women , in particular , premenopausal women ; patients with hypoxemia ; and in patients with underlying central nervous system disease [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 , 8 . 5 ) ] .
Avoid Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with or at risk for hyponatremia .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor serum sodium concentrations .
Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome with risk of seizures and cerebral edema .
To avoid complications , monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations , fluid status , acid - base balance , and signs of neurologic complications .
High volume infusion must be used with close monitoring in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure , and in patients with non - osmotic vasopressin release ( including SIADH ) , due to the risk of hospital - acquired hyponatremia .
5 . 4 Hypokalemia Excessive administration of Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection may result in significant hypokalemia .
Hypokalemic periodic paralysis , metabolic alkalosis , increased gastrointestinal losses ( e . g . diarrhea , vomiting ) , prolonged low potassium diet , or primary hyperaldosteronism may increase the risk of hypokalemia . Avoid the administration of Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with or at risk of hypokalemia or taking medications that may increase the risk .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor serum potassium levels .
5 . 5 Hypernatremia and Hyperchloremia Electrolyte imbalances such as hypernatremia and hyperchloremia , leading to metabolic acidosis may occur with solutions containing 0 . 9 % sodium chloride .
Conditions that may increase the risk of hypernatremia , fluid overload and edema ( central and peripheral ) , include patients with pre - eclampsia , primary hyperaldosteronism and secondary hyperaldosteronism associated with , for example , hypertension , congestive heart failure , severe renal impairment , liver disease ( including cirrhosis ) , and renal disease ( including renal artery stenosis , nephrosclerosis ) .
Medications such as corticosteroids or corticotropin , may increase the risk of sodium and fluid retention .
Avoid in patients with or at risk for hypernatremia .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor serum sodium concentrations .
Rapid correction of hypernatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications .
Excessively rapid correction of hypernatremia is also associated with a risk for serious neurologic complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome ( ODS ) with risk of seizures and cerebral edema .
5 . 6 Fluid Overload Depending on the volume and rate of infusion , the patient ’ s underlying clinical condition and capability to metabolize dextrose , intravenous administration of Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection can cause fluid and / or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
Avoid Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with or at risk for fluid and / or solute overloading .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor fluid balance , electrolyte concentrations , and acid - base balance as needed and especially during prolonged use .
5 . 7 Refeeding Syndrome Refeeding severely undernourished patients may result in the refeeding syndrome that is characterized by the shift of potassium , phosphorus , and magnesium intracellularly as the patient becomes anabolic .
Thiamine deficiency and fluid retention may also develop .
To prevent these complications , monitor severely undernourished patients and slowly increasing nutrient intake .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS - Anaphylactic reaction , hypersensitivity , and chills - Hyponatremia ( applies to solutions containing less than 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride ) Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response , infection at the site of injection , venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection , extravasation and hypervolemia .
If an adverse reaction does occur , discontinue the infusion , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
Adverse reactions include electrolyte imbalances , hyperglycemia , and hypervolemia and injection site reactions .

Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Sodium is present in human breast milk .
There are no data on the effects of Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection on a breastfed infant or the effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety profile of Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection in pediatric patients is similar to adults .
Neonates , especially premature infants with low birth weight , are at increased risk of developing hypo - or hyperglycemia and therefore need close monitoring during treatment with intravenous glucose solutions to ensure adequate glycemic control in order to avoid potential long - term adverse effects .
Closely monitor plasma electrolyte concentrations in pediatric patients who may have impaired ability to regulate fluids and electrolytes .
In very low birth weight infants , excessive or rapid administration of Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection may result in increased serum osmolality and risk of intracerebral hemorrhage .
Children ( including neonates and older children ) are at increased risk of developing hyponatremia as well as for developing hyponatremic encephalopathy .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Elderly patients are at increased risk of developing hyponatremia as well as for developing hyponatremic encephalopathy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of adverse reactions to this product may be greater in patients with impaired renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 5 ) ] .
Dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Administration of Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection in patients with renal impairment may result in hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state , hyponatremia , and / or fluid overload .
Monitor patients with renal impairment for development of these adverse reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 3 , 5 . 5 , 5 . 6 ) ] .
