RECENT MAJOR CHANGES Indications and Usage , Primary Hyperparathyroidism ( 1 . 3 ) 11 / 2014 Warnings and Precautions , Hypocalcemia ( 5 . 1 ) 11 / 2014 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sensipar is a calcium - sensing receptor agonist indicated for : • Secondary Hyperparathyroidism ( HPT ) in adult patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) on dialysis .
( 1 . 1 ) • Hypercalcemia in adult patients with Parathyroid Carcinoma ( PC ) .
( 1 . 2 ) • Hypercalcemia in adult patients with primary HPT for whom parathyroidectomy would be indicated on the basis of serum calcium levels , but who are unable to undergo parathyroidectomy .
( 1 . 3 ) 1 . 1 Secondary Hyperparathyroidism Sensipar is indicated for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism ( HPT ) in adult patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) on dialysis [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
Limitations of Use : Sensipar is not indicated for use in adult patients with CKD who are not on dialysis because of an increased risk of hypocalcemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
1 . 2 Parathyroid Carcinoma Sensipar is indicated for the treatment of hypercalcemia in adult patients with Parathyroid Carcinoma [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
1 . 3 Primary Hyperparathyroidism Sensipar is indicated for the treatment of hypercalcemia in adult patients with primary HPT for whom parathyroidectomy would be indicated on the basis of serum calcium levels , but who are unable to undergo parathyroidectomy [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Sensipar tablets should be taken whole and should not be divided .
Sensipar should be taken with food or shortly after a meal .
Dosage must be individualized .
For all indications , Sensipar should be taken with food or shortly after a meal and should always be taken whole and not divided .
• Secondary HPT in patients with CKD on dialysis ( 2 . 1 ) : • Starting dose is 30 mg once daily .
• Titrate dose no more frequently than every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , and 180 mg once daily as necessary to achieve targeted intact parathyroid hormone ( iPTH ) levels .
• iPTH levels should be measured no earlier than 12 hours after most recent dose .
• Hypercalcemia in patients with PC or hypercalcemia in patients with primary HPT ( 2 . 2 ) : • Starting dose is 30 mg twice daily .
• Titrate dose every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30 mg twice daily , 60 mg twice daily , 90 mg twice daily , and 90 mg three or four times daily as necessary to normalize serum calcium levels .
2 . 1 Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Adult Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease on Dialysis The recommended starting oral dose of Sensipar is 30 mg once daily .
Serum calcium and serum phosphorus should be measured within 1 week and intact parathyroid hormone ( iPTH ) should be measured 1 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment of Sensipar [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Sensipar should be titrated no more frequently than every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , and 180 mg once daily to target iPTH levels of 150 to 300 pg / mL .
Serum iPTH levels should be assessed no earlier than 12 hours after dosing with Sensipar .
Sensipar can be used alone or in combination with vitamin D sterols and / or phosphate binders .
During dose titration , serum calcium levels should be monitored frequently and if levels decrease below the normal range , appropriate steps should be taken to increase serum calcium levels , such as by providing supplemental calcium , initiating or increasing the dose of calcium - based phosphate binder , initiating or increasing the dose of vitamin D sterols , or temporarily withholding treatment with Sensipar [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 2 Parathyroid Carcinoma and Primary Hyperparathyroidism The recommended starting oral dose of Sensipar is 30 mg twice daily .
The dose of Sensipar should be titrated every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30 mg twice daily , 60 mg twice daily , and 90 mg twice daily , and 90 mg 3 or 4 times daily as necessary to normalize serum calcium levels .
Serum calcium should be measured within 1 week after initiation or dose adjustment of Sensipar [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 3 Monitoring for Hypocalcemia Once the maintenance dose has been established , serum calcium should be measured approximately monthly for patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism with CKD on dialysis , and every 2 months for patients with parathyroid carcinoma or primary hyperparathyroidism [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 ) ] .
For secondary hyperparathyroidism patients with CKD on dialysis , if serum calcium falls below 8 . 4 mg / dL but remains above 7 . 5 mg / dL , or if symptoms of hypocalcemia occur , calcium - containing phosphate binders and / or vitamin D sterols can be used to raise serum calcium .
If serum calcium falls below 7 . 5 mg / dL , or if symptoms of hypocalcemia persist and the dose of vitamin D cannot be increased , withhold administration of Sensipar until serum calcium levels reach 8 . 0 mg / dL and / or symptoms of hypocalcemia have resolved .
Treatment should be reinitiated using the next lowest dose of Sensipar [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Sensipar tablets are formulated as light - green , film - coated , oval - shaped tablets marked with “ AMG ” on one side and “ 30 ” or “ 60 ” or “ 90 ” on the opposite side of the 30 mg , 60 mg , or 90 mg strengths , respectively .
Tablets : 30 , 60 , and 90 mg tablets ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Sensipar treatment initiation is contraindicated if serum calcium is less than the lower limit of the normal range [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Sensipar treatment initiation is contraindicated if serum calcium is less than the lower limit of the normal range .
( 4 , 5 . 1 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypocalcemia : Life threatening events and fatal outcomes were reported .
Hypocalcemia can prolong QT interval , lower the threshold for seizures , and cause hypotension , worsening heart failure , and / or arrhythmia .
Monitor serum calcium carefully for the occurrence of hypocalcemia during treatment ( 2 . 3 , 5 . 1 ) • Adynamic Bone Disease : May develop if iPTH levels are suppressed below 100 pg / mL .
( 5 . 2 ) • Hepatic Impairment : Cinacalcet exposure ( i . e . area under the plasma concentration time curve ) is increased in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment .
Patients should be closely monitored for serum calcium , serum phosphorus , and iPTH levels throughout treatment .
( 5 . 3 , 8 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Hypocalcemia Sensipar lowers serum calcium and , therefore , patients should be carefully monitored for the occurrence of hypocalcemia during treatment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Life threatening events and fatal outcomes associated with hypocalcemia have been reported in patients treated with Sensipar , including pediatric patients [ see Pediatric Use ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Potential manifestations of hypocalcemia include paresthesias , myalgias , muscle cramping , tetany , and convulsions .
Sensipar is not indicated for patients with CKD not on dialysis [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
In patients with secondary HPT and CKD not on dialysis , the long term safety and efficacy of Sensipar have not been established .
Clinical studies indicate that Sensipar - treated patients with CKD not on dialysis have an increased risk for hypocalcemia compared with Sensipar - treated patients with CKD on dialysis , which may be due to lower baseline calcium levels .
In a phase 3 study of 32 weeks duration and including 404 patients with CKD not on dialysis ( 302 cinacalcet , 102 placebo ) , in which the median dose for cinacalcet was 60 mg per day at the completion of the study , 80 % of Sensipar - treated patients experienced at least one serum calcium value < 8 . 4 mg / dL compared with 5 % of patients receiving placebo .
QT Prolongation Decreases in serum calcium can also prolong the QT interval , potentially resulting in ventricular arrhythmia .
Cases of QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia secondary to hypocalcemia have been reported in patients treated with Sensipar .
Seizures In clinical studies , seizures ( primarily generalized or tonic - clonic ) were observed in 1 . 4 % ( 43 / 3049 ) of Sensipar - treated patients and 0 . 7 % ( 5 / 687 ) of placebo - treated patients .
While the basis for the reported difference in seizure rate is not clear , the threshold for seizures is lowered by significant reductions in serum calcium levels .
Therefore , serum calcium levels should be closely monitored in patients receiving Sensipar , particularly in patients with a history of a seizure disorder .
Hypotension and / or Worsening Heart Failure In postmarketing safety surveillance , isolated , idiosyncratic cases of hypotension , worsening heart failure , and / or arrhythmia have been reported in patients with impaired cardiac function , in which a causal relationship to Sensipar could not be completely excluded and which may be mediated by reductions in serum calcium levels [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 2 Adynamic Bone Disease Adynamic bone disease may develop if iPTH levels are suppressed below 100 pg / mL .
One clinical study evaluated bone histomorphometry in patients treated with Sensipar for 1 year .
Three patients with mild hyperparathyroid bone disease at the beginning of the study developed adynamic bone disease during treatment with Sensipar .
Two of these patients had iPTH levels below 100 pg / mL at multiple time points during the study .
In three 6 - month , phase 3 studies conducted in patients with CKD on dialysis , 11 % of patients treated with Sensipar had mean iPTH values below 100 pg / mL during the efficacy - assessment phase .
If iPTH levels decrease below 150 pg / mL in patients treated with Sensipar , the dose of Sensipar and / or vitamin D sterols should be reduced or therapy discontinued .
5 . 3 Hepatic Impairment Cinacalcet exposure , as defined by the Area Under the Plasma Drug Concentration Time Curve ( AUC0 - infinite ) , is increased by 2 . 4 and 4 . 2 fold in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment , respectively .
These patients should be monitored throughout treatment with Sensipar [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions ( i . e . , ≥ 25 % ) associated with Sensipar were nausea and vomiting .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease on Dialysis In three double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trials , 1126 patients with CKD on dialysis received study drug ( 656 Sensipar , 470 placebo ) for up to 6 months .
The most frequently reported adverse reactions are listed in Table 1 .
Seizures were observed in 1 . 4 % ( 13 / 910 ) of Sensipar - treated patients and 0 . 7 % ( 5 / 641 ) of placebo - treated patients across all completed placebo controlled trials .
Table 1 .

Parathyroid Carcinoma and Primary Hyperparathyroidism The safety profile of Sensipar in these patient populations is generally consistent with that seen in patients with CKD on dialysis .
Forty six patients were treated with Sensipar in a single arm study , 29 with Parathyroid Carcinoma and 17 with intractable pHPT .
Nine ( 20 % ) of the patients withdrew from the study due to adverse events .
The most frequent adverse reactions and the most frequent cause of withdrawal in these patient populations were nausea and vomiting .
Severe or prolonged cases of nausea and vomiting can lead to dehydration and worsening hypercalcemia so careful monitoring of electrolytes is recommended in patients with these symptoms .
Eight patients died during treatment with Sensipar in this study , 7 with Parathyroid Carcinoma ( 24 % ) and 1 ( 6 % ) with intractable pHPT .
Causes of death were cardiovascular ( 5 patients ) , multi - organ failure ( 1 patient ) , gastrointestinal hemorrhage ( 1 patient ) and metastatic carcinoma ( 1 patient ) .
Adverse events of hypocalcemia were reported in three patients ( 7 % ) .
Seizures were observed in 0 . 7 % ( 1 / 140 ) of cinacalcet - treated patients and 0 . 0 % ( 0 / 46 ) of placebo - treated patients in all clinical studies .

Less than 1 % of patients in each group permanently discontinued study drug due to hypocalcemia .
In a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study in patients with secondary HPT and CKD receiving dialysis in which patients were treated for up to 64 months ( mean duration of treatment was 21 months in the cinacalcet group ) , 75 % of patients receiving Sensipar compared with 29 % of patients receiving placebo developed at least one serum calcium value less than 8 . 4 mg / dL and 33 % of cinacalcet patients compared with 12 % of patients receiving placebo had at least one serum calcium value less than 7 . 5 mg / dL .
Most of the cases of severe hypocalcemia less than 7 . 5 mg / dL ( 21 / 33 = 64 % ) occurred during the first 6 months .
In this trial , 1 . 1 % of patients receiving Sensipar and 0 . 1 % of patients receiving placebo permanently discontinued study drug due to hypocalcemia .
During a placebo - controlled part of a 52 - week study in patients with primary HPT who met criteria for parathyroidectomy on the basis of corrected total serum calcium ( > 11 . 3 mg / dl [ 2 . 82 mmol / L ] and ≤ 12 . 5 mg / dl [ 3 . 12 mmol / L ] ) , serum calcium less than 8 . 4 mg / dL was observed in 6 . 1 % ( 2 / 33 ) of Sensipar treated patients and 0 % ( 0 / 34 ) of placebo treated patients .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience with Sensipar The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Sensipar .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Rash and hypersensitivity reactions ( including angioedema and urticaria ) , and myalgia have been identified as adverse reactions during post approval use of Sensipar .
Isolated , idiosyncratic cases of hypotension , worsening heart failure , and / or arrhythmia have been reported in Sensipar - treated patients with impaired cardiac function in postmarketing safety surveillance [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Co - administration with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor may increase serum levels of cinacalcet .
Dose adjustment and monitoring of iPTH serum phosphorous and serum calcium may be required .
( 7 . 1 ) • Cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 .
Dose adjustments may be required for concomitant medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 .
( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Cinacalcet is partially metabolized by CYP3A4 .
Dose adjustment of Sensipar may be required if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ( e . g . , ketoconazole , itraconazole ) .
The iPTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored in these patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 CYP2D6 Substrates Cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 .
Dose adjustments may be required for concomitant medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 ( e . g . , desipramine , metoprolol , and carvedilol ) and particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index ( e . g . , flecainide and most tricyclic antidepressants ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Sensipar should only be used if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Pregnancy registry available .
( 8 . 1 ) • Pediatric Use : A fatal outcome was reported in a pediatric clinical trial patient with severe hypocalcemia .
Sensipar is not indicated for use in pediatric patients ( 8 . 4 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy : Category C In pregnant female rats given oral gavage doses of 2 , 25 , 50 mg / kg / day cinacalcet during gestation , no teratogenicity was observed at doses up to 50 mg / kg / day ( exposure 4 times those resulting with a human oral dose of 180 mg / day based on Area Under the Curve [ AUC ] comparison ) .
Decreased fetal body weights were observed at all doses ( less than 1 to 4 times a human oral dose of 180 mg / day based on AUC comparison ) in conjunction with maternal toxicity ( decreased food consumption and body weight gain ) .
In pregnant female rabbits given oral gavage doses of 2 , 12 , 25 mg / kg / day cinacalcet during gestation , no adverse fetal effects were observed ( exposures less than with a human oral dose of 180 mg / day based on AUC comparisons ) .
Reductions in maternal food consumption and body weight gain were seen at doses of 12 and 25 mg / kg / day .
Sensipar has been shown to cross the placental barrier in rabbits .
In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 5 , 15 , 25 mg / kg / day cinacalcet during gestation through lactation , no adverse fetal or pup ( post - weaning ) effects were observed at 5 mg / kg / day ( exposures less than with a human therapeutic dose of 180 mg / day based on AUC comparisons ) .
Higher doses of 15 and 25 mg / kg / day cinacalcet ( exposures 2 to 3 times a human oral dose of 180 mg / day based on AUC comparisons ) were accompanied by maternal signs of hypocalcemia ( periparturient mortality and early postnatal pup loss ) , and reductions in postnatal maternal and pup body - weight gain .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of Sensipar in pregnant women .
Sensipar should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Women who become pregnant during Sensipar treatment are encouraged to enroll in Amgen ’ s Pregnancy Surveillance Program .
Patients or their physicians should call 1 - 800 - 77 - AMGEN ( 1 - 800 - 772 - 6436 ) to enroll .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Studies in rats have shown that Sensipar is excreted in the milk with a high milk - to - plasma ratio .
It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Considering these data in rats , and because many drugs are excreted in human milk and there is a potential for clinically significant adverse reactions in infants who ingest Sensipar , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the lactating woman .
Women who choose to continue Sensipar treatment while nursing are encouraged to enroll in Amgen ’ s Lactation Surveillance Program .
Patients or their physicians should call 1 - 800 - 77 - AMGEN ( 1 - 800 - 772 - 6436 ) to enroll .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Sensipar in pediatric patients have not been established .
Sensipar is not indicated for use in pediatric patients .
A fatal outcome was reported in a pediatric clinical trial patient with severe hypocalcaemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects ( n = 1136 ) in clinical studies of Sensipar , 26 percent were 65 and over , and 9 percent were 75 and over .
No overall differences in the safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary for renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment should have serum calcium , serum phosphorus , and iPTH levels monitored closely throughout treatment with Sensipar because cinacalcet exposure ( AUC0 - infinite ) is increased by 2 . 4 and 4 . 2 fold , respectively , in these patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Doses titrated up to 300 mg once daily have been safely administered to patients on dialysis .
Overdosage of Sensipar may lead to hypocalcemia .
In the event of overdosage , patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia and appropriate measures taken to correct serum calcium levels [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Since Sensipar is highly protein bound , hemodialysis is not an effective treatment for overdosage of Sensipar .
11 DESCRIPTION Sensipar ( cinacalcet ) is a calcimimetic agent that increases the sensitivity of the calcium - sensing receptor to activation by extracellular calcium .
Sensipar tablets contain the hydrochloride salt of cinacalcet .
Its empirical formula is C22H22F3N · HCl with a molecular weight of 393 . 9 g / mol ( hydrochloride salt ) and 357 . 4 g / mol ( free base ) .
It has one chiral center having an R - absolute configuration .
The R - enantiomer is the more potent enantiomer and has been shown to be responsible for pharmacodynamic activity .
The hydrochloride salt of cinacalcet is a white to off - white , crystalline solid that is soluble in methanol or 95 % ethanol and slightly soluble in water .
Sensipar tablets are formulated as light - green , film - coated , oval - shaped tablets for oral administration in strengths of 30 mg , 60 mg , and 90 mg of cinacalcet as the free base equivalent ( 33 mg , 66 mg , and 99 mg as the hydrochloride salt , respectively ) .
The hydrochloride salt of cinacalcet is described chemically as N - [ 1 - ( R ) - ( - ) - ( 1 - naphthyl ) ethyl ] - 3 - [ 3 - ( trifluoromethyl ) phenyl ] - 1 - aminopropane hydrochloride and has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Inactive Ingredients The following are the inactive ingredients in Sensipar tablets : pre - gelatinized starch , microcrystalline cellulose , povidone , crospovidone , colloidal silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate .
Tablets are coated with color ( Opadry ® II green ) , clear film coat ( Opadry ® clear ) , and carnauba wax .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The calcium - sensing receptor on the surface of the chief cell of the parathyroid gland is the principal regulator of PTH synthesis and secretion .
Cinacalcet , the active ingredient in Sensipar , directly lowers PTH levels by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium - sensing receptor to extracellular calcium .
The reduction in PTH is associated with a concomitant decrease in serum calcium levels .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Reduction in iPTH levels correlated with the plasma cinacalcet concentrations in patients with CKD .
The nadir in iPTH level occurs approximately 2 to 6 hours post dose , corresponding with the maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) of cinacalcet .
After steady - state cinacalcet concentrations are reached ( which occurs within 7 days of dose change ) , serum calcium concentrations remain constant over the dosing interval in patients with CKD .
Reductions in PTH are associated with a decrease in bone turnover and bone fibrosis in patients with CKD on dialysis and uncontrolled secondary HPT .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution After oral administration of cinacalcet , Cmax is achieved in approximately 2 to 6 hours .
Cinacalcet Cmax and AUC ( 0 - infinite ) were increased by 82 % and 68 % , respectively , following administration with a high - fat meal compared with fasting in healthy volunteers .
The Cmax and AUC ( 0 - infinite ) of cinacalcet were increased by 65 % and 50 % , respectively , when cinacalcet was administered with a low - fat meal compared with fasting .
After absorption , cinacalcet concentrations decline in a biphasic fashion with a terminal half - life of 30 to 40 hours .
Steady - state drug levels are achieved within 7 days , and the mean accumulation ratio is approximately 2 with once daily oral administration .
The median accumulation ratio is approximately 2 to 5 with twice daily oral administration .
The AUC and Cmax of cinacalcet increase proportionally over the dose range of 30 to 180 mg once daily .
The pharmacokinetic profile of cinacalcet does not change over time with once daily dosing of 30 to 180 mg .
The volume of distribution is approximately 1000 L , indicating extensive distribution .
Cinacalcet is approximately 93 % to 97 % bound to plasma protein ( s ) .
The ratio of blood cinacalcet concentration to plasma cinacalcet concentration is 0 . 80 at a blood cinacalcet concentration of 10 ng / mL .
Metabolism and Excretion Cinacalcet is metabolized by multiple enzymes , primarily CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 , and CYP1A2 .
After administration of a 75 mg radiolabeled dose to healthy volunteers , cinacalcet was metabolized via : 1 ) oxidative N - dealkylation to hydrocinnamic acid and hydroxy - hydrocinnamic acid , which are further metabolized via β - oxidation and glycine conjugation ; the oxidative N - dealkylation process also generates metabolites that contain the naphthalene ring ; and 2 ) oxidation of the naphthalene ring on the parent drug forming dihydrodiols , which are further conjugated with glucuronic acid .
The plasma concentrations of the major circulating metabolites , including the cinnamic acid derivatives and glucuronidated dihydrodiols , markedly exceed the parent drug concentrations .
The hydrocinnamic acid metabolite and glucuronide conjugates have minimal or no calcimimetic activity .
Renal excretion of metabolites was the primary route of elimination of radioactivity .
Approximately 80 % of the dose was recovered in the urine and 15 % in the feces .
Specific Populations Age : Geriatric Population The pharmacokinetic profile of cinacalcet in geriatric patients ( age ≥ 65 years , n = 12 ) is similar to that for patients who are < 65 years of age ( n = 268 ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Age : Pediatric Population The pharmacokinetics of cinacalcet has not been studied in patients < 18 years of age [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Hepatic Impairment The disposition of a 50 mg Sensipar single dose was compared between patients with hepatic impairment and patients with normal hepatic function .
Cinacalcet exposure ( AUC ( 0 - infinite ) ) was comparable between healthy volunteers and patients with mild hepatic impairment .
However , in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment ( as indicated by the Child - Pugh method ) , cinacalcet exposures ( AUC ( 0 - infinite ) ) were 2 . 4 and 4 . 2 fold higher , respectively , than that in healthy volunteers .
The mean half - life of cinacalcet increased from 49 hours in healthy volunteers to 65 hours and 84 hours in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment , respectively .
Protein binding of cinacalcet is not affected by impaired hepatic function [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetic profile of a 75 mg Sensipar single dose in patients with mild , moderate , and severe renal impairment , and those on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is comparable with that in healthy volunteers [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Drug Interactions In vitro studies indicate that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 , but not an inhibitor of CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , and CYP3A4 .
In vitro induction studies indicate that cinacalcet is not an inducer of CYP450 enzymes .
Tables 5 and 6 list the findings from in vivo drug - drug interaction studies .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Standard lifetime dietary carcinogenicity bioassays were conducted in mice and rats .
Mice were given cinacalcet at dietary doses of 15 , 50 , and 125 mg / kg / day in males and 30 , 70 , and 200 mg / kg / day in females ( exposures up to 2 times those resulting with a human oral dose of 180 mg / day based on AUC comparison ) .
Rats were given dietary doses of 5 , 15 , and 35 mg / kg / day in males and 5 , 20 , and 35 mg / kg / day in females ( exposures up to 2 times those resulting with a human oral dose of 180 mg / day based on AUC comparison ) .
No increased incidence of tumors was observed following treatment with cinacalcet .
Mutagenicity Cinacalcet was not genotoxic in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay , nor in the Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cell HGPRT forward mutation assay and CHO cell chromosomal aberration assay , with and without metabolic activation , nor in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
Impairment of Fertility Female rats were given oral gavage doses of 5 , 25 , and 75 mg / kg / day cinacalcet beginning 2 weeks before mating and continuing through gestation day 7 .
Male rats were given oral doses 4 weeks prior to mating , during mating ( 3 weeks ) and 2 weeks postmating .
No effects were observed in male or female fertility at 5 and 25 mg / kg / day ( exposures up to 3 times those resulting with a human oral dose of 180 mg / day based on AUC comparison ) .
At 75 mg / kg / day , there were slight adverse effects ( slight decreases in body weight and food consumption ) in males and females .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease on Dialysis Three 6 - month , multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical studies of similar design were conducted in patients with CKD on dialysis .
A total of 665 patients were randomized to Sensipar and 471 patients to placebo .
The mean age of the patients was 54 years , 62 % were male , and 52 % were Caucasian .
The average baseline iPTH level by the Nichols IRMA was 712 pg / mL , with 26 % of the patients having a baseline iPTH level > 800 pg / mL .
The mean baseline Ca x P product was 61 mg2 / dL2 .
The average duration of dialysis prior to study enrollment was 67 months .
Ninety - six percent of patients were on hemodialysis and 4 % on peritoneal dialysis .
At study entry , 66 % of the patients were receiving vitamin D sterols and 93 % were receiving phosphate binders .
Sensipar ( or placebo ) was initiated at a dose of 30 mg once daily and titrated every 3 or 4 weeks to a maximum dose of 180 mg once daily to achieve an iPTH of ≤ 250 pg / mL .
The dose was not increased if a patient had any of the following : iPTH ≤ 200 pg / mL , serum calcium < 7 . 8 mg / dL , or any symptoms of hypocalcemia .
If a patient experienced symptoms of hypocalcemia or had a serum calcium < 8 . 4 mg / dL , calcium supplements and / or calcium - based phosphate binders could be increased .
If these measures were insufficient , the vitamin D dose could be increased .
Approximately 70 % of patients in the Sensipar arm and 80 % of the patients in the placebo arm completed the 6 - month studies .
In the primary efficacy analysis , 40 % of the patients on Sensipar and 5 % of placebo - treated patients achieved an iPTH ≤ 250 pg / mL ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( Table 7 , Figure 1 ) .
These studies showed that Sensipar reduced iPTH while lowering Ca x P , calcium , and phosphorus levels ( Table 7 , Figure 2 ) .
The median dose of Sensipar at the completion of the studies was 90 mg .
Patients with milder disease typically required lower doses .
Similar results were observed when either the iPTH or biointact PTH ( biPTH ) assay was used to measure PTH levels in CKD patients on dialysis ; treatment with cinacalcet did not alter the relationship between iPTH and biPTH .

Reductions in iPTH and Ca x P were maintained for up to 12 months of treatment .
Sensipar decreased iPTH and Ca x P levels regardless of disease severity ( i . e . , baseline iPTH value ) , duration of dialysis , and whether or not vitamin D sterols were administered .
Approximately 60 % of patients with mild ( iPTH ≥ 300 to ≤ 500 pg / mL ) , 41 % with moderate ( iPTH > 500 to 800 pg / mL ) , and 11 % with severe ( iPTH > 800 pg / mL ) secondary HPT achieved a mean iPTH value of ≤ 250 pg / mL .
Plasma iPTH levels were measured using the Nichols IRMA .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Parathyroid Carcinoma Twenty - nine patients with Parathyroid Carcinoma were enrolled in a single - arm , open - label study .
The study consisted of two phases , a dose - titration phase and a maintenance phase .
Patients initially received 30 mg cinacalcet twice daily and then were titrated every 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 90 mg four times daily .
Dosage escalation during the variable - length ( 2 to 16 weeks ) titration phase continued until the serum calcium concentration was ≤ 10 mg / dL ( 2 . 5 mmol / L ) , the patient reached the highest possible dosage , or adverse events precluded further dosage increases .
Twenty - nine patients entered the study .
The median exposure to cinacalcet was 229 days ( range : 1 to 1051 ) .
At baseline the mean ( SE ) serum calcium was 14 . 1 ( 0 . 4 ) mg / dL .
At the end of the titration phase , the mean ( SE ) serum calcium was 12 . 4 ( 0 . 5 ) mg / dL , which is a mean reduction of 1 . 7 ( 0 . 6 ) mg / dL from baseline .
Figure 3 illustrates mean serum calcium ( mg / dL ) over time for all patients still on study at each time point from the beginning of titration to study visit week 80 .
Daily dose during the study ranged from 30 mg twice daily to 90 mg four times daily .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 3 Patients with Hypercalcemia Due to Primary Hyperparathyroidism Seventeen patients with severe hypercalcemia due to primary HPT , who had failed or had contraindications to parathyroidectomy , participated in an open - label , single - arm study .
The study consisted of two phases , a dose - titration phase and a maintenance phase .
In this trial severe hypercalcemia was defined as a screening serum calcium level of > 12 . 5 mg / dL .
Patients initially received 30 mg cinacalcet twice daily and then were titrated every 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 90 mg 4 times daily .
Dosage escalation during the variable - length ( 2 to 16 weeks ) titration phase continued until the serum calcium concentration was ≤ 10 mg / dL ( 2 . 5 mmol / L ) , the patient reached the highest possible dosage , or adverse events precluded further dosage increases .
Seventeen patients entered the study .
The median exposure to cinacalcet was 270 days ( range : 32 to 1 , 105 ) .
At baseline the mean ( SE ) serum calcium was 12 . 7 ( 0 . 2 ) mg / dL .
At the end of the titration phase the mean ( SE ) serum calcium was 10 . 4 ( 0 . 3 ) mg / dL , which is a mean reduction of 2 . 3 ( 0 . 3 ) mg / dL from baseline .
Figure 4 illustrates mean serum calcium ( mg / dL ) over time for all patients still on study at each time point from the beginning of titration to study visit week 80 .
Daily dose during the study ranged from 30 mg twice a day to 90 mg four times a day .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] n = Number of patients with non - missing values at the timepoint .
End of Titration ( EOT ) phase could occur at any visit from week 2 to 16 .
Patients at EOT are those who completed titration .
Sixty - seven patients with primary HPT who met criteria for parathyroidectomy on the basis of corrected total serum calcium ( > 11 . 3 mg / dl [ 2 . 82 mmol / L ] and ≤ 12 . 5 mg / dl [ 3 . 12 mmol / L ] ) , but who were unable to undergo parathyroidectomy participated in a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study .
A total of 33 patients were randomized to Sensipar and 34 patients randomized to placebo .
The mean age of the patients was 72 years , 52 % were female , 61 % were Caucasian , and 5 % were Blacks .
The study started with a 12 - week titration phase , followed by a 16 - week efficacy assessment phase .
Cinacalcet was initiated at a dose of 30 mg twice daily and titrated to maintain a corrected total serum calcium concentration within the normal range .
During the efficacy period a significantly higher percentage of cinacalcet treated patients compared with the placebo treated patients achieved mean corrected total serum calcium concentration ( ≤ 10 . 3 mg / dL [ 2 . 57 mmol / L ] , 75 . 8 % vs 0 % , p < 0 . 001 ) and ≥ 1 mg / dL [ 0 . 25 mmol / L ] decrease from baseline in mean corrected total serum calcium concentration ( 84 . 8 % vs 5 . 9 % , p < 0 . 001 ) .
The median dose of Sensipar at the completion of the study was 60 mg / day .
