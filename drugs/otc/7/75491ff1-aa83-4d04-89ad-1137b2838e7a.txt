• Severe renal impairment , end - stage renal disease , or dialysis [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
• History of serious hypersensitivity reaction to empagliflozin or any of the excipients in JARDIANCE ( 4 ) • Severe renal impairment , end - stage renal disease , or dialysis ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypotension : Before initiating JARDIANCE assess and correct volume status in patients with renal impairment , the elderly , in patients with low systolic blood pressure , and in patients on diuretics .
Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy .
( 5 . 1 ) • Ketoacidosis : Assess patients who present with signs and symptoms of metabolic acidosis for ketoacidosis , regardless of blood glucose level .
If suspected , discontinue JARDIANCE , evaluate and treat promptly .
Before initiating JARDIANCE , consider risk factors for ketoacidosis .
Patients on JARDIANCE may require monitoring and temporary discontinuation of therapy in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis .
( 5 . 2 ) • Acute kidney injury and impairment in renal function : Consider temporarily discontinuing in settings of reduced oral intake or fluid losses .
If acute kidney injury occurs , discontinue and promptly treat .
Monitor renal function during therapy .
( 5 . 3 ) • Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis : Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly , if indicated ( 5 . 4 ) • Hypoglycemia : Consider lowering the dose of insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when initiating JARDIANCE ( 5 . 5 ) • Genital mycotic infections : Monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5 . 6 ) • Hypersensitivity reactions : Discontinue JARDIANCE , treat promptly , and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve ( 5 . 7 ) • Increased LDL - C : Monitor and treat as appropriate ( 5 . 8 ) 5 . 1 Hypotension JARDIANCE causes intravascular volume contraction .
Symptomatic hypotension may occur after initiating JARDIANCE [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] particularly in patients with renal impairment , the elderly , in patients with low systolic blood pressure , and in patients on diuretics .
Before initiating JARDIANCE , assess for volume contraction and correct volume status if indicated .
Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension after initiating therapy and increase monitoring in clinical situations where volume contraction is expected [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
5 . 2 Ketoacidosis Reports of ketoacidosis , a serious life - threatening condition requiring urgent hospitalization have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving sodium glucose co - transporter - 2 ( SGLT2 ) inhibitors , including JARDIANCE .
Fatal cases of ketoacidosis have been reported in patients taking JARDIANCE .
JARDIANCE is not indicated for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
Patients treated with JARDIANCE who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis should be assessed for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels , as ketoacidosis associated with JARDIANCE may be present even if blood glucose levels are less than 250 mg / dL .
If ketoacidosis is suspected , JARDIANCE should be discontinued , patient should be evaluated , and prompt treatment should be instituted .
Treatment of ketoacidosis may require insulin , fluid and carbohydrate replacement .
In many of the postmarketing reports , and particularly in patients with type 1 diabetes , the presence of ketoacidosis was not immediately recognized and institution of treatment was delayed because presenting blood glucose levels were below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis ( often less than 250 mg / dL ) .
Signs and symptoms at presentation were consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and included nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , generalized malaise , and shortness of breath .
In some but not all cases , factors predisposing to ketoacidosis such as insulin dose reduction , acute febrile illness , reduced caloric intake due to illness or surgery , pancreatic disorders suggesting insulin deficiency ( e . g . , type 1 diabetes , history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery ) , and alcohol abuse were identified .
Before initiating JARDIANCE , consider factors in the patient history that may predispose to ketoacidosis including pancreatic insulin deficiency from any cause , caloric restriction , and alcohol abuse .
In patients treated with JARDIANCE consider monitoring for ketoacidosis and temporarily discontinuing JARDIANCE in clinical situations known to predispose to ketoacidosis ( e . g . , prolonged fasting due to acute illness or surgery ) .
5 . 3 Acute Kidney Injury and Impairment in Renal Function JARDIANCE causes intravascular volume contraction [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] and can cause renal impairment [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury , some requiring hospitalization and dialysis , in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors , including JARDIANCE ; some reports involved patients younger than 65 years of age .
Before initiating JARDIANCE , consider factors that may predispose patients to acute kidney injury including hypovolemia , chronic renal insufficiency , congestive heart failure and concomitant medications ( diuretics , ACE inhibitors , ARBs , NSAIDs ) .
Consider temporarily discontinuing JARDIANCE in any setting of reduced oral intake ( such as acute illness or fasting ) or fluid losses ( such as gastrointestinal illness or excessive heat exposure ) ; monitor patients for signs and symptoms of acute kidney injury .
If acute kidney injury occurs , discontinue JARDIANCE promptly and institute treatment .
JARDIANCE increases serum creatinine and decreases eGFR .
Patients with hypovolemia may be more susceptible to these changes .
Renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating JARDIANCE [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Renal function should be evaluated prior to initiation of JARDIANCE and monitored periodically thereafter .
More frequent renal function monitoring is recommended in patients with an eGFR below 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 .
Use of JARDIANCE is not recommended when eGFR is persistently less than 45 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 and is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Contraindications ( 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
5 . 4 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections including urosepsis and pyelonephritis requiring hospitalization in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors , including JARDIANCE .
Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections .
Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly , if indicated [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
5 . 5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues are known to cause hypoglycemia .
The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when JARDIANCE is used in combination with insulin secretagogues ( e . g . , sulfonylurea ) or insulin [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Therefore , a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with JARDIANCE .
5 . 6 Genital Mycotic Infections JARDIANCE increases the risk for genital mycotic infections [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent genital mycotic infections were more likely to develop genital mycotic infections .
Monitor and treat as appropriate .
5 . 7 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions , ( e . g . , angioedema ) in patients treated with JARDIANCE .
If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs , discontinue JARDIANCE ; treat promptly per standard of care , and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve .
JARDIANCE is contraindicated in patients with a previous serious hypersensitivity reaction to empagliflozin or any of the excipients in JARDIANCE [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
5 . 8 Increased Low - Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ( LDL - C ) Increases in LDL - C can occur with JARDIANCE [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor and treat as appropriate .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following important adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling : • Hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Ketoacidosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Acute Kidney Injury and Impairment in Renal Function [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Genital Mycotic Infections [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] • Increased Low - Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ( LDL - C ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] • The most common adverse reactions associated with JARDIANCE ( 5 % or greater incidence ) were urinary tract infections and female genital mycotic infections ( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals , Inc . at 1 - 800 - 542 - 6257 or 1 - 800 - 459 - 9906 TTY , or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Pool of Placebo - Controlled Trials evaluating JARDIANCE 10 and 25 mg The data in Table 1 are derived from a pool of four 24 - week placebo - controlled trials and 18 - week data from a placebo - controlled trial with insulin .
JARDIANCE was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add - on therapy in four trials [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
These data reflect exposure of 1976 patients to JARDIANCE with a mean exposure duration of approximately 23 weeks .
Patients received placebo ( N = 995 ) , JARDIANCE 10 mg ( N = 999 ) , or JARDIANCE 25 mg ( N = 977 ) once daily .
The mean age of the population was 56 years and 3 % were older than 75 years of age .
More than half ( 55 % ) of the population was male ; 46 % were White , 50 % were Asian , and 3 % were Black or African American .
At baseline , 57 % of the population had diabetes more than 5 years and had a mean hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) of 8 % .
Established microvascular complications of diabetes at baseline included diabetic nephropathy ( 7 % ) , retinopathy ( 8 % ) , or neuropathy ( 16 % ) .
Baseline renal function was normal or mildly impaired in 91 % of patients and moderately impaired in 9 % of patients ( mean eGFR 86 . 8 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) .
Table 1 shows common adverse reactions ( excluding hypoglycemia ) associated with the use of JARDIANCE .
The adverse reactions were not present at baseline , occurred more commonly on JARDIANCE than on placebo and occurred in greater than or equal to 2 % of patients treated with JARDIANCE 10 mg or JARDIANCE 25 mg .
Table 1 Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥ 2 % of Patients Treated with JARDIANCE and Greater than Placebo in Pooled Placebo - Controlled Clinical Studies of JARDIANCE Monotherapy or Combination TherapyaPredefined adverse event grouping , including , but not limited to , urinary tract infection , asymptomatic bacteriuria , cystitis bFemale genital mycotic infections include the following adverse reactions : vulvovaginal mycotic infection , vaginal infection , vulvitis , vulvovaginal candidiasis , genital infection , genital candidiasis , genital infection fungal , genitourinary tract infection , vulvovaginitis , cervicitis , urogenital infection fungal , vaginitis bacterial .

Volume Depletion JARDIANCE causes an osmotic diuresis , which may lead to intravascular volume contraction and adverse reactions related to volume depletion .
In the pool of five placebo - controlled clinical trials , adverse reactions related to volume depletion ( e . g . , blood pressure ( ambulatory ) decreased , blood pressure systolic decreased , dehydration , hypotension , hypovolemia , orthostatic hypotension , and syncope ) were reported by 0 . 3 % , 0 . 5 % , and 0 . 3 % of patients treated with placebo , JARDIANCE 10 mg , and JARDIANCE 25 mg , respectively .
JARDIANCE may increase the risk of hypotension in patients at risk for volume contraction [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 , 8 . 6 ) ] .
Increased Urination In the pool of five placebo - controlled clinical trials , adverse reactions of increased urination ( e . g . , polyuria , pollakiuria , and nocturia ) occurred more frequently on JARDIANCE than on placebo ( see Table 1 ) .
Specifically , nocturia was reported by 0 . 4 % , 0 . 3 % , and 0 . 8 % of patients treated with placebo , JARDIANCE 10 mg , and JARDIANCE 25 mg , respectively .
Acute Impairment in Renal Function Treatment with JARDIANCE was associated with increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR ( see Table 2 ) .
Patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline had larger mean changes [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 , 8 . 6 ) ] .
In a long - term cardiovascular outcome trial , the acute impairment in renal function was observed to reverse after treatment discontinuation suggesting acute hemodynamic changes play a role in the renal function changes observed with empagliflozin .

Discontinuation from study due to genital infection occurred in 0 % of placebo - treated patients and 0 . 2 % of patients treated with either JARDIANCE 10 or 25 mg .
Genital mycotic infections occurred more frequently in female than male patients ( see Table 1 ) .
Phimosis occurred more frequently in male patients treated with JARDIANCE 10 mg ( less than 0 . 1 % ) and JARDIANCE 25 mg ( 0 . 1 % ) than placebo ( 0 % ) .
Urinary Tract Infections In the pool of five placebo - controlled clinical trials , the incidence of urinary tract infections ( e . g . , urinary tract infection , asymptomatic bacteriuria , and cystitis ) was increased in patients treated with JARDIANCE compared to placebo ( see Table 1 ) .
Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections were more likely to experience a urinary tract infection .
The rate of treatment discontinuation due to urinary tract infections was 0 . 1 % , 0 . 2 % , and 0 . 1 % for placebo , JARDIANCE 10 mg , and JARDIANCE 25 mg , respectively .
Urinary tract infections occurred more frequently in female patients .
The incidence of urinary tract infections in female patients randomized to placebo , JARDIANCE 10 mg , and JARDIANCE 25 mg was 16 . 6 % , 18 . 4 % , and 17 . 0 % , respectively .
The incidence of urinary tract infections in male patients randomized to placebo , JARDIANCE 10 mg , and JARDIANCE 25 mg was 3 . 2 % , 3 . 6 % , and 4 . 1 % , respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Laboratory Tests Increase in Low - Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ( LDL - C ) Dose - related increases in low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL - C ) were observed in patients treated with JARDIANCE .
LDL - C increased by 2 . 3 % , 4 . 6 % , and 6 . 5 % in patients treated with placebo , JARDIANCE 10 mg , and JARDIANCE 25 mg , respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] .
The range of mean baseline LDL - C levels was 90 . 3 to 90 . 6 mg / dL across treatment groups .
Increase in Hematocrit In a pool of four placebo - controlled studies , median hematocrit decreased by 1 . 3 % in placebo and increased by 2 . 8 % in JARDIANCE 10 mg and 2 . 8 % in JARDIANCE 25 mg treated patients .
At the end of treatment , 0 . 6 % , 2 . 7 % , and 3 . 5 % of patients with hematocrits initially within the reference range had values above the upper limit of the reference range with placebo , JARDIANCE 10 mg , and JARDIANCE 25 mg , respectively .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JARDIANCE .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Ketoacidosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Urosepsis and pyelonephritis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Angioedema [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] • Skin reactions ( e . g . , rash , urticaria ) 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Diuretics Coadministration of empagliflozin with diuretics resulted in increased urine volume and frequency of voids , which might enhance the potential for volume depletion [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
7 . 2 Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Coadministration of empagliflozin with insulin or insulin secretagogues increases the risk for hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
7 . 3 Positive Urine Glucose Test Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors as SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests .
Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control .
7 . 4 Interference with 1 , 5 - anhydroglucitol ( 1 , 5 - AG ) Assay Monitoring glycemic control with 1 , 5 - AG assay is not recommended as measurements of 1 , 5 - AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors .
Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Advise females of the potential risk to a fetus especially during the second and third trimesters ( 8 . 1 ) • Lactation : JARDIANCE is not recommended when breastfeeding ( 8 . 2 ) • Geriatric patients : Higher incidence of adverse reactions related to volume depletion and reduced renal function ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 , 8 . 5 ) • Patients with renal impairment : Higher incidence of adverse reactions related to reduced renal function ( 2 . 2 , 5 . 3 , 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal data showing adverse renal effects , JARDIANCE is not recommended during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy .
Limited data available with JARDIANCE in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug - associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage .
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
In animal studies , adverse renal changes were observed in rats when empagliflozin was administered during a period of renal development corresponding to the late second and third trimesters of human pregnancy .
Doses approximately 13 - times the maximum clinical dose caused renal pelvic and tubule dilatations that were reversible .
Empagliflozin was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits up to 300 mg / kg / day , which approximates 48 - times and 128 - times , respectively , the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg when administered during organogenesis [ see Data ] .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 - 10 % in women with pre - gestational diabetes with a HbA1c > 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 - 25 % in women with HbA1c > 10 .
The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk : Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis , pre - eclampsia , spontaneous abortions , preterm delivery , stillbirth , and delivery complications .
Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects , stillbirth , and macrosomia related morbidity .
Data Animal Data Empagliflozin dosed directly to juvenile rats from postnatal day ( PND ) 21 until PND 90 at doses of 1 , 10 , 30 and 100 mg / kg / day caused increased kidney weights and renal tubular and pelvic dilatation at 100 mg / kg / day , which approximates 13 - times the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg , based on AUC .
These findings were not observed after a 13 week drug - free recovery period .
These outcomes occurred with drug exposure during periods of renal development in rats that correspond to the late second and third trimester of human renal development .
In embryo - fetal development studies in rats and rabbits , empagliflozin was administered for intervals coinciding with the first trimester period of organogenesis in humans .
Doses up to 300 mg / kg / day , which approximates 48 - times ( rats ) and 128 - times ( rabbits ) the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg ( based on AUC ) , did not result in adverse developmental effects .
In rats , at higher doses of empagliflozin causing maternal toxicity , malformations of limb bones increased in fetuses at 700 mg / kg / day or 154 - times the 25 mg maximum clinical dose .
Empagliflozin crosses the placenta and reaches fetal tissues in rats .
In the rabbit , higher doses of empagliflozin resulted in maternal and fetal toxicity at 700 mg / kg / day , or 139 - times the 25 mg maximum clinical dose .
In pre - and postnatal development studies in pregnant rats , empagliflozin was administered from gestation day 6 through to lactation day 20 ( weaning ) at up to 100 mg / kg / day ( approximately 16 times the 25 mg maximum clinical dose ) without maternal toxicity .
Reduced body weight was observed in the offspring at greater than or equal to 30 mg / kg / day ( approximately 4 times the 25 mg maximum clinical dose ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of JARDIANCE in human milk , the effects of JARDIANCE on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production .
Empagliflozin is present in the milk of lactating rats [ see Data ] .
Since human kidney maturation occurs in utero and during the first 2 years of life when lactational exposure may occur , there may be risk to the developing human kidney .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant , including the potential for empagliflozin to affect postnatal renal development , advise women that use of JARDIANCE is not recommended while breastfeeding .
Data Empagliflozin was present at a low level in rat fetal tissues after a single oral dose to the dams at gestation day 18 .
In rat milk , the mean milk to plasma ratio ranged from 0 . 634 - 5 , and was greater than one from 2 to 24 hours post - dose .
The mean maximal milk to plasma ratio of 5 occurred at 8 hours post - dose , suggesting accumulation of empagliflozin in the milk .
Juvenile rats directly exposed to empagliflozin showed a risk to the developing kidney ( renal pelvic and tubular dilatations ) during maturation .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JARDIANCE in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No JARDIANCE dosage change is recommended based on age [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
In studies assessing the efficacy of empagliflozin in improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes , a total of 2721 ( 32 % ) patients treated with empagliflozin were 65 years of age and older , and 491 ( 6 % ) were 75 years of age and older .
JARDIANCE is expected to have diminished glycemic efficacy in elderly patients with renal impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
The risk of volume depletion - related adverse reactions increased in patients who were 75 years of age and older to 2 . 1 % , 2 . 3 % , and 4 . 4 % for placebo , JARDIANCE 10 mg , and JARDIANCE 25 mg .
The risk of urinary tract infections increased in patients who were 75 years of age and older to 10 . 5 % , 15 . 7 % , and 15 . 1 % in patients randomized to placebo , JARDIANCE 10 mg , and JARDIANCE 25 mg , respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment The efficacy and safety of JARDIANCE were evaluated in a study of patients with mild and moderate renal impairment [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
In this study , 195 patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 60 and 90 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 , 91 patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 45 and 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 and 97 patients exposed to JARDIANCE had an eGFR between 30 and 45 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 .
The glucose lowering benefit of JARDIANCE 25 mg decreased in patients with worsening renal function .
The risks of renal impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] , volume depletion adverse reactions and urinary tract infection - related adverse reactions increased with worsening renal function .
In a large cardiovascular outcomes study , there were 1819 patients with eGFR below 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 .
The cardiovascular death findings in this subgroup were consistent with the overall findings [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The efficacy and safety of JARDIANCE have not been established in patients with severe renal impairment , with ESRD , or receiving dialysis .
JARDIANCE is not expected to be effective in these patient populations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment JARDIANCE may be used in patients with hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of an overdose with JARDIANCE , contact the Poison Control Center .
Employ the usual supportive measures ( e . g . , remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract , employ clinical monitoring , and institute supportive treatment ) as dictated by the patient ’ s clinical status .
Removal of empagliflozin by hemodialysis has not been studied .
11 DESCRIPTION JARDIANCE tablets contain empagliflozin , an orally - active inhibitor of the sodium - glucose co - transporter 2 ( SGLT2 ) .
The chemical name of empagliflozin is D - Glucitol , 1 , 5 - anhydro - 1 - C - [ 4 - chloro - 3 - [ [ 4 - [ [ ( 3 S ) - tetrahydro - 3 - furanyl ] oxy ] phenyl ] methyl ] phenyl ] - , ( 1 S ) .
Its molecular formula is C23H27ClO7 and the molecular weight is 450 . 91 .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Empagliflozin is a white to yellowish , non - hygroscopic powder .
It is very slightly soluble in water , sparingly soluble in methanol , slightly soluble in ethanol and acetonitrile ; soluble in 50 % acetonitrile / water ; and practically insoluble in toluene .
Each film - coated tablet of JARDIANCE contains 10 mg or 25 mg of empagliflozin ( free base ) and the following inactive ingredients : lactose monohydrate , microcrystalline cellulose , hydroxypropyl cellulose , croscarmellose sodium , colloidal silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate .
In addition , the film coating contains the following inactive ingredients : hypromellose , titanium dioxide , talc , polyethylene glycol , and yellow ferric oxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Sodium - glucose co - transporter 2 ( SGLT2 ) is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation .
Empagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2 .
By inhibiting SGLT2 , empagliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose , and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Urinary Glucose Excretion In patients with type 2 diabetes , urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following a dose of JARDIANCE and was maintained at the end of a 4 - week treatment period averaging at approximately 64 grams per day with 10 mg empagliflozin and 78 grams per day with 25 mg JARDIANCE once daily [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Urinary Volume In a 5 - day study , mean 24 - hour urine volume increase from baseline was 341 mL on Day 1 and 135 mL on Day 5 of empagliflozin 25 mg once daily treatment .
Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized , placebo - controlled , active - comparator , crossover study , 30 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of JARDIANCE 25 mg , JARDIANCE 200 mg ( 8 times the maximum dose ) , moxifloxacin , and placebo .
No increase in QTc was observed with either 25 mg or 200 mg empagliflozin .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin has been characterized in healthy volunteers and patients with type 2 diabetes and no clinically relevant differences were noted between the two populations .
After oral administration , peak plasma concentrations of empagliflozin were reached at 1 . 5 hours post - dose .
Thereafter , plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner with a rapid distribution phase and a relatively slow terminal phase .
The steady state mean plasma AUC and Cmax were 1870 nmol · h / L and 259 nmol / L , respectively , with 10 mg empagliflozin once daily treatment , and 4740 nmol · h / L and 687 nmol / L , respectively , with 25 mg empagliflozin once daily treatment .
Systemic exposure of empagliflozin increased in a dose - proportional manner in the therapeutic dose range .
The single - dose and steady - state pharmacokinetic parameters of empagliflozin were similar , suggesting linear pharmacokinetics with respect to time .
Administration of 25 mg empagliflozin after intake of a high - fat and high - calorie meal resulted in slightly lower exposure ; AUC decreased by approximately 16 % and Cmax decreased by approximately 37 % , compared to fasted condition .
The observed effect of food on empagliflozin pharmacokinetics was not considered clinically relevant and empagliflozin may be administered with or without food .
Distribution The apparent steady - state volume of distribution was estimated to be 73 . 8 L based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis .
Following administration of an oral [ 14 C ] - empagliflozin solution to healthy subjects , the red blood cell partitioning was approximately 36 . 8 % and plasma protein binding was 86 . 2 % .
Metabolism No major metabolites of empagliflozin were detected in human plasma and the most abundant metabolites were three glucuronide conjugates ( 2 - O - , 3 - O - , and 6 - O - glucuronide ) .
Systemic exposure of each metabolite was less than 10 % of total drug - related material .
In vitro studies suggested that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5 ' - diphospho - glucuronosyltransferases UGT2B7 , UGT1A3 , UGT1A8 , and UGT1A9 .
Elimination The apparent terminal elimination half - life of empagliflozin was estimated to be 12 . 4 h and apparent oral clearance was 10 . 6 L / h based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis .
Following once - daily dosing , up to 22 % accumulation , with respect to plasma AUC , was observed at steady - state , which was consistent with empagliflozin half - life .
Following administration of an oral [ 14 C ] - empagliflozin solution to healthy subjects , approximately 95 . 6 % of the drug - related radioactivity was eliminated in feces ( 41 . 2 % ) or urine ( 54 . 4 % ) .
The majority of drug - related radioactivity recovered in feces was unchanged parent drug and approximately half of drug - related radioactivity excreted in urine was unchanged parent drug .
Specific Populations Renal Impairment In patients with mild ( eGFR : 60 to less than 90 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , moderate ( eGFR : 30 to less than 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , and severe ( eGFR : less than 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) renal impairment and subjects with kidney failure / end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patients , AUC of empagliflozin increased by approximately 18 % , 20 % , 66 % , and 48 % , respectively , compared to subjects with normal renal function .
Peak plasma levels of empagliflozin were similar in subjects with moderate renal impairment and kidney failure / ESRD compared to patients with normal renal function .
Peak plasma levels of empagliflozin were roughly 20 % higher in subjects with mild and severe renal impairment as compared to subjects with normal renal function .
Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that the apparent oral clearance of empagliflozin decreased , with a decrease in eGFR leading to an increase in drug exposure .
However , the fraction of empagliflozin that was excreted unchanged in urine , and urinary glucose excretion , declined with decrease in eGFR .
Hepatic Impairment In subjects with mild , moderate , and severe hepatic impairment according to the Child - Pugh classification , AUC of empagliflozin increased by approximately 23 % , 47 % , and 75 % , and Cmax increased by approximately 4 % , 23 % , and 48 % , respectively , compared to subjects with normal hepatic function .
Effects of Age , Body Mass Index , Gender , and Race Based on the population PK analysis , age , body mass index ( BMI ) , gender and race ( Asians versus primarily Whites ) do not have a clinically meaningful effect on pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Pediatric Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of empagliflozin in pediatric patients have not been performed .
Drug Interactions In vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Empagliflozin does not inhibit , inactivate , or induce CYP450 isoforms .
In vitro data suggest that the primary route of metabolism of empagliflozin in humans is glucuronidation by the uridine 5 ' - diphospho - glucuronosyltransferases UGT1A3 , UGT1A8 , UGT1A9 , and UGT2B7 .
Empagliflozin does not inhibit UGT1A1 , UGT1A3 , UGT1A8 , UGT1A9 , or UGT2B7 .
Therefore , no effect of empagliflozin is anticipated on concomitantly administered drugs that are substrates of the major CYP450 isoforms or UGT1A1 , UGT1A3 , UGT1A8 , UGT1A9 , or UGT2B7 .
The effect of UGT induction ( e . g . , induction by rifampicin or any other UGT enzyme inducer ) on empagliflozin exposure has not been evaluated .
Empagliflozin is a substrate for P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) and breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) , but it does not inhibit these efflux transporters at therapeutic doses .
Based on in vitro studies , empagliflozin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with drugs that are P - gp substrates .
Empagliflozin is a substrate of the human uptake transporters OAT3 , OATP1B1 , and OATP1B3 , but not OAT1 and OCT2 .
Empagliflozin does not inhibit any of these human uptake transporters at clinically relevant plasma concentrations and , therefore , no effect of empagliflozin is anticipated on concomitantly administered drugs that are substrates of these uptake transporters .
In vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions No dose adjustment of JARDIANCE is recommended when coadministered with commonly prescribed medicinal products based on results of the described pharmacokinetic studies .
Empagliflozin pharmacokinetics were similar with and without coadministration of metformin , glimepiride , pioglitazone , sitagliptin , linagliptin , warfarin , verapamil , ramipril , and simvastatin in healthy volunteers and with or without coadministration of hydrochlorothiazide and torsemide in patients with type 2 diabetes ( see Figure 1 ) .
The observed increases in overall exposure ( AUC ) of empagliflozin following coadministration with gemfibrozil , rifampicin , or probenecid are not clinically relevant .
In subjects with normal renal function , coadministration of empagliflozin with probenecid resulted in a 30 % decrease in the fraction of empagliflozin excreted in urine without any effect on 24 - hour urinary glucose excretion .
The relevance of this observation to patients with renal impairment is unknown .

Empagliflozin did not increase the incidence of tumors in female rats dosed at 100 , 300 , or 700 mg / kg / day ( up to 72 times the exposure from the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg ) .
In male rats , hemangiomas of the mesenteric lymph node were increased significantly at 700 mg / kg / day or approximately 42 times the exposure from a 25 mg clinical dose .
Empagliflozin did not increase the incidence of tumors in female mice dosed at 100 , 300 , or 1000 mg / kg / day ( up to 62 times the exposure from a 25 mg clinical dose ) .
Renal tubule adenomas and carcinomas were observed in male mice at 1000 mg / kg / day , which is approximately 45 times the exposure of the maximum clinical dose of 25 mg .
These tumors may be associated with a metabolic pathway predominantly present in the male mouse kidney .
Mutagenesis Empagliflozin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the in vitro Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay , the in vitro L5178Y tk + / - mouse lymphoma cell assay , and an in vivo micronucleus assay in rats .
Impairment of Fertility Empagliflozin had no effects on mating , fertility or early embryonic development in treated male or female rats up to the high dose of 700 mg / kg / day ( approximately 155 times the 25 mg clinical dose in males and females , respectively ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Glycemic Control JARDIANCE has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin , sulfonylurea , pioglitazone , linagliptin , and insulin .
JARDIANCE has also been studied in patients with type 2 diabetes with mild or moderate renal impairment .
In patients with type 2 diabetes , treatment with JARDIANCE reduced hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) , compared to placebo .
The reduction in HbA1c for JARDIANCE compared with placebo was observed across subgroups including gender , race , geographic region , baseline BMI and duration of disease .
Monotherapy A total of 986 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a double - blind , placebo - controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JARDIANCE monotherapy .

At the end of the run - in period , patients who remained inadequately controlled and had an HbA1c between 7 and 10 . 5 % were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 to one of 5 active - treatment arms of JARDIANCE 10 mg or 25 mg , linagliptin 5 mg , or linagliptin 5 mg in combination with 10 mg or 25 mg JARDIANCE as a fixed dose combination tablet .
At Week 24 , JARDIANCE 10 mg or 25 mg used in combination with linagliptin 5 mg provided statistically significant improvement in HbA1c ( p - value < 0 . 0001 ) and FPG ( p - value < 0 . 001 ) compared to the individual components in patients who had been inadequately controlled on metformin .
Treatment with JARDIANCE / linagliptin 25 mg / 5 mg or JARDIANCE / linagliptin 10 mg / 5 mg daily also resulted in a statistically significant reduction in body weight compared to linagliptin 5 mg ( p - value < 0 . 0001 ) .
There was no statistically significant difference in body weight compared to JARDIANCE alone .
Active - Controlled Study versus Glimepiride in Combination with Metformin The efficacy of JARDIANCE was evaluated in a double - blind , glimepiride - controlled , study in 1545 patients with type 2 diabetes with insufficient glycemic control despite metformin therapy .
Patients with inadequate glycemic control and an HbA1c between 7 % and 10 % after a 2 - week run - in period were randomized to glimepiride or JARDIANCE 25 mg .
At Week 52 , JARDIANCE 25 mg and glimepiride lowered HbA1c and FPG ( see Table 8 , Figure 4 ) .
The difference in observed effect size between JARDIANCE 25 mg and glimepiride excluded the pre - specified non - inferiority margin of 0 . 3 % .
The mean daily dose of glimepiride was 2 . 7 mg and the maximal approved dose in the United States is 8 mg per day .

At Week 104 , the adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c was - 0 . 75 % for JARDIANCE 25 mg and - 0 . 66 % for glimepiride .
The adjusted mean treatment difference was - 0 . 09 % with a 97 . 5 % confidence interval of ( - 0 . 32 % , 0 . 15 % ) , excluding the pre - specified non - inferiority margin of 0 . 3 % .
The mean daily dose of glimepiride was 2 . 7 mg and the maximal approved dose in the United States is 8 mg per day .
The Week 104 analysis included data with and without concomitant glycemic rescue medication , as well as off - treatment data .
Missing data for patients not providing any information at the visit were imputed based on the observed off - treatment data .
In this multiple imputation analysis , 13 . 9 % of the data were imputed for JARDIANCE 25 mg and 12 . 9 % for glimepiride .
At Week 104 , JARDIANCE 25 mg daily resulted in a statistically significant difference in change from baseline for body weight compared to glimepiride ( - 3 . 1 kg for JARDIANCE 25 mg vs . + 1 . 3 kg for glimepiride ; ANCOVA - LOCF , p - value < 0 . 0001 ) .
Add - On Combination Therapy with Pioglitazone with or without Metformin A total of 498 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a double - blind , placebo - controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JARDIANCE in combination with pioglitazone , with or without metformin .
Patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes on metformin at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day and pioglitazone at a dose of at least 30 mg per day were placed into an open - label placebo run - in for 2 weeks .
Patients with inadequate glycemic control and an HbA1c between 7 % and 10 % after the run - in period were randomized to placebo , JARDIANCE 10 mg , or JARDIANCE 25 mg .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease The effect of JARDIANCE on cardiovascular risk in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established , stable , atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was evaluated in the EMPA - REG OUTCOME study , a multicenter , multi - national , randomized , double - blind parallel group trial .
The study compared the risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) between JARDIANCE and placebo when these were added to and used concomitantly with standard of care treatments for diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease .
Coadministered antidiabetic medications were to be kept stable for the first 12 weeks of the trial .
Thereafter , antidiabetic and atherosclerotic therapies could be adjusted , at the discretion of investigators , to ensure participants were treated according to the standard care for these diseases .
A total of 7020 patients were treated ( JARDIANCE 10 mg = 2345 ; JARDIANCE 25 mg = 2342 ; placebo = 2333 ) and followed for a median of 3 . 1 years .
Approximately 72 % of the study population was Caucasian , 22 % was Asian , and 5 % was Black .
The mean age was 63 years and approximately 72 % were male .
All patients in the study had inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline ( HbA1c greater than or equal to 7 % ) .
The mean HbA1c at baseline was 8 . 1 % and 57 % of participants had had diabetes for more than 10 years .
Approximately 31 % , 22 % and 20 % reported a past history of neuropathy , retinopathy and nephropathy to investigators respectively and the mean eGFR was 74 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 .
At baseline , patients were treated with one ( ~ 30 % ) or more ( ~ 70 % ) antidiabetic medications including metformin ( 74 % ) , insulin ( 48 % ) , and sulfonylurea ( 43 % ) .
All patients had established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at baseline including one ( 82 % ) or more ( 18 % ) of the following ; a documented history of coronary artery disease ( 76 % ) , stroke ( 23 % ) or peripheral artery disease ( 21 % ) .
At baseline , the mean systolic blood pressure was 136 mmHg , the mean diastolic blood pressure was 76 mmHg , the mean LDL was 86 mg / dL , the mean HDL was 44 mg / dL , and the mean urinary albumin to creatinine ratio ( UACR ) was 175 mg / g .
At baseline , approximately 81 % of patients were treated with renin angiotensin system inhibitors , 65 % with beta - blockers , 43 % with diuretics , 77 % with statins , and 86 % with antiplatelet agents ( mostly aspirin ) .
The primary endpoint in EMPA - REG OUTCOME was the time to first occurrence of a Major Adverse Cardiac Event ( MACE ) .
A major adverse cardiac event was defined as occurrence of either a cardiovascular death or a nonfatal myocardial infarction ( MI ) or a nonfatal stroke .
The statistical analysis plan had pre - specified that the 10 and 25 mg doses would be combined .
A Cox proportional hazards model was used to test for non - inferiority against the pre - specified risk margin of 1 . 3 for the hazard ratio of MACE and superiority on MACE if non - inferiority was demonstrated .
Type - 1 error was controlled across multiples tests using a hierarchical testing strategy .
JARDIANCE significantly reduced the risk of first occurrence of primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death , non - fatal myocardial infarction , or non - fatal stroke ( HR : 0 . 86 ; 95 % CI 0 . 74 , 0 . 99 ) .
The treatment effect was due to a significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death in subjects randomized to empagliflozin ( HR : 0 . 62 ; 95 % CI 0 . 49 , 0 . 77 ) , with no change in the risk of non - fatal myocardial infarction or non - fatal stroke ( see Table 13 and Figure 5 and 6 ) .
Results for the 10 mg and 25 mg empagliflozin doses were consistent with results for the combined dose groups .

Vital status was obtained for 99 . 2 % of subjects in the trial .
A total of 463 deaths were recorded during the EMPA - REG OUTCOME trial .
Most of these deaths were categorized as cardiovascular deaths .
The non - cardiovascular deaths were only a small proportion of deaths , and were balanced between the treatment groups ( 2 . 1 % in patients treated with JARDIANCE , and 2 . 4 % of patients treated with placebo ) .
