CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection USP provides electrolytes and is a source of water for hydration .
It is capable of inducing diuresis depending on the clinical condition of the patient .
Sodium , the major cation of the extracellular fluid , functions primarily in the control of water distribution , fluid balance , and osmotic pressure of body fluids .
Sodium is also associated with chloride and bicarbonate in the regulation of the acid - base equilibrium of body fluid .
Chloride , the major extracellular anion , closely follows the metabolism of sodium , and changes in the acid - base balance of the body are reflected by changes in the chloride concentration .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection USP is indicated as pharmaceutic aid and diluent for the infusion of compatible drug additives .
Refer to prescribing information accompanying additive drugs .
CONTRAINDICATIONS This solution is contraindicated where the administration of sodium or chloride could be clinically detrimental .
WARNINGS The administration of intravenous solutions can cause fluid and / or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration .
The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentration .
Solutions containing sodium ions should be used with great care , if at all , in patients with congestive heart failure , severe renal insufficiency , and in clinical states in which there is sodium retention with edema .
In patients with diminished renal function , administration of solutions containing sodium ions may result in sodium retention .
Infusion of isotonic ( 0 . 9 % ) sodium chloride during or immediately after surgery may result in excessive sodium retention .
Use the patient ’ s circulatory system status as a guide .
PRECAUTIONS General Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance , electrolyte concentrations , and acid - base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation .
Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require tailoring of the electrolyte pattern , in these or alternative solutions .
Since Sodium Chloride Injection does not contain antimicrobial agents and is intended for single use , any unused amount must be discarded immediately following withdrawal of any portion of the contents of the ampoule .
Do not open ampoule until it is to be used .
This solution should be used with care in patients with hypervolemia , renal insufficiency , urinary tract obstruction , or impending or frank cardiac decompensation .
Consult the manufactures instructions for choice of vehicle , appropriate dilution or volume for dissolving the drug to be injected , including the route and rate of injection .
Extraordinary electrolyte losses such as may occur during protracted nasogastric suction , vomiting , diarrhea or gastrointestinal fistula drainage may necessitate additional electrolyte supplementation .
Additional essential electrolytes , minerals and vitamins should be supplied as needed .
Sodium - containing solutions should be administered with caution to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin , or to other salt - retaining patients .
Care should be exercised in administering solutions containing sodium to patients with renal or cardiovascular insufficiency , with or without congestive heart failure , particularly if they are postoperative or elderly .
Infusion of more than one liter of isotonic ( 0 . 9 % ) sodium chloride per day may supply more sodium and chloride than normally found in serum , and can exceed normal tolerance , resulting in hypernatremia ; this may also cause a loss of bicarbonate ions , resulting in an acidifying effect .
To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing this solution with other additives that may be prescribed , the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing , prior to administration and periodically during administration .
If administration is controlled by a pumping device , care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result .
This solution is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment .
It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours .
Use only if solution is clear and container and glass ampoule is intact .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Studies with 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection USP have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , mutagenic potential or effects on fertility .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection USP .
It is also not known whether 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection USP is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of sodium chloride injections in pediatric patients have not been established by adequate and well controlled trials , however , the use of electrolyte solutions in the pediatric population is referenced in the medical literature .
The warnings , precautions and adverse reactions identified in the label copy should be observed in the pediatric population .
Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Reactions which may occur because of the solution , added drugs or the technique of reconstitution or administration include febrile response , infection at the site of injection , venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection , extravasation and hypervolemia .
Carefully review the prescribing information for the diluted drug .
The physician should also be alert to the possibility of adverse reactions to drug additives .
Prescribing information for drug additives to be administered in this manner should be consulted .
Symptoms may result from an excess or deficit of one or more of the ions present in the solution ; therefore , frequent monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential .
Hypernatremia may be associated with edema and exacerbation of congestive heart failure due to the retention of water , resulting in an expanded extracellular fluid volume .
If infused in large amounts , chloride ions may cause a loss of bicarbonate ions , resulting in an acidifying effect .
If an adverse reaction does occur , discontinue the infusion , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures , and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of a fluid or solute overload during parenteral therapy , reevaluate the patient ’ s condition and institute appropriate corrective treatment .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION This solution is for intravenous use only .
Dosage is to be directed by a physician and is dependent upon age , weight , clinical condition of the patient and laboratory determinations .
Frequent laboratory determinations and clinical evaluation are essential to monitor changes in blood glucose and electrolyte concentrations , and fluid and electrolyte balance during prolonged parenteral therapy .
In the average adult , daily requirements of sodium and chloride are met by the infusion of one liter of 0 . 9 % sodium chloride ( 154 mEq each of sodium and chloride ) .
There is no specific pediatric dose .
The dose is dependent on weight , clinical condition and laboratory results .
Follow recommendations of appropriate pediatric reference text .
