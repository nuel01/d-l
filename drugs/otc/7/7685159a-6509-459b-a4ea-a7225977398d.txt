Each tube contains 50 mg testosterone in 5 g of gel .
Topical gel : 50 mg of testosterone in a unit - dose tube ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Testosterone gel 1 % is contraindicated in men with carcinoma of the breast or known or suspected carcinoma of the prostate [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
• Testosterone gel 1 % is contraindicated in women who are pregnant .
Testosterone can cause virilization of the female fetus when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 2 ) ] .
• Men with known carcinoma of the breast or known or suspected carcinoma of the prostate .
( 4 , 5 . 1 ) • Women who are pregnant .
Testosterone may cause fetal harm .
( 4 , 5 . 7 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 2 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Monitor patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH .
( 5 . 1 ) • Avoid unintentional exposure of women or children to testosterone gel 1 % .
Secondary exposure to testosterone can produce signs of virilization .
Testosterone gel 1 % should be discontinued until the cause of virilization is identified .
( 5 . 2 ) • Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) , including deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) and pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , have been reported in patients using testosterone products .
Evaluate patients with signs or symptoms consistent with DVT or PE .
( 5 . 4 ) • Some postmarketing studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke associated with use of testosterone replacement therapy .
( 5 . 5 ) • Exogenous administration of androgens may lead to azoospermia .
( 5 . 8 ) • Edema , with or without congestive heart failure , may be a complication in patients with preexisting cardiac , renal , or hepatic disease .
( 5 . 10 , 6 . 2 ) • Sleep apnea may occur in those with risk factors .
( 5 . 12 ) • Monitor prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) , hematocrit , and lipid concentrations periodically .
( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 , 5 . 13 ) • Testosterone gel 1 % is flammable until dry .
( 5 . 16 ) 5 . 1 Worsening of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ( BPH ) and Potential Risk of Prostate Cancer • Patients with BPH treated with androgens are at an increased risk for worsening of signs and symptoms of BPH .
Monitor patients with BPH for worsening signs and symptoms .
• Patients treated with androgens may be at increased risk for prostate cancer .
Evaluate patients for prostate cancer prior to initiating and during treatment with androgens [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
5 . 2 Potential for Secondary Exposure to Testosterone Cases of secondary exposure resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance .
Signs and symptoms have included enlargement of the penis or clitoris , development of pubic hair , increased erections and libido , aggressive behavior , and advanced bone age .
In most cases , these signs and symptoms regressed with removal of the exposure to testosterone gel .
In a few cases , however , enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age - appropriate normal size , and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age .
The risk of transfer was increased in some of these cases by not adhering to precautions for the appropriate use of the topical testosterone product .
Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application sites in men using testosterone gel 1 % [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Inappropriate changes in genital size or development of pubic hair or libido in children , or changes in body hair distribution , significant increase in acne , or other signs of virilization in adult women should be brought to the attention of a physician and the possibility of secondary exposure to testosterone gel should also be brought to the attention of a physician .
Testosterone gel should be promptly discontinued until the cause of virilization has been identified .
5 . 3 Polycythemia Increases in hematocrit , reflective of increases in red blood cell mass , may require lowering or discontinuation of testosterone .
Check hematocrit prior to initiating treatment .
It would also be appropriate to re - evaluate the hematocrit 3 to 6 months after starting treatment , and then annually .
If hematocrit becomes elevated , stop therapy until hematocrit decreases to an acceptable concentration .
An increase in red blood cell mass may increase the risk of thromboembolic events .
5 . 4 Venous Thromboembolism ( VTE ) There have been postmarketing reports of venous thromboembolic events , including deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) and pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , in patients using testosterone products , such as testosterone gel 1 % .
Evaluate patients who report symptoms of pain , edema , warmth and erythema in the lower extremity for DVT and those who present with acute shortness of breath for PE .
If a venous thromboembolic event is suspected , discontinue treatment with testosterone gel 1 % and initiate appropriate workup and management [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 5 Cardiovascular Risk Long term clinical safety trials have not been conducted to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of testosterone replacement therapy in men .
To date , epidemiologic studies and randomized controlled trials have been inconclusive for determining the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE ) , such as non - fatal myocardial infarction , non - fatal stroke , and cardiovascular death , with the use of testosterone compared to non - use .
Some studies , but not all , have reported an increased risk of MACE in association with use of testosterone replacement therapy in men .
Patients should be informed of this possible risk when deciding whether to use or to continue to use testosterone gel 1 % .
5 . 6 Abuse of Testosterone and Monitoring of Serum Testosterone Concentrations Testosterone has been subject to abuse , typically at doses higher than recommended for the approved indication and in combination with other anabolic androgenic steroids .
Anabolic androgenic steroid abuse can lead to serious cardiovascular and psychiatric adverse reactions [ see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 ) ] .
If testosterone abuse is suspected , check serum testosterone concentrations to ensure they are within therapeutic range .
However , testosterone levels may be in the normal or subnormal range in men abusing synthetic testosterone derivatives .
Counsel patients concerning the serious adverse reactions associated with abuse of testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroids .
Conversely , consider the possibility of testosterone and anabolic androgenic steroid abuse in suspected patients who present with serious cardiovascular or psychiatric adverse events .
5 . 7 Use in Women Due to lack of controlled evaluations in women and potential virilizing effects , testosterone gel 1 % is not indicated for use in women [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 8 Potential for Adverse Effects on Spermatogenesis With large doses of exogenous androgens , including testosterone gel 1 % , spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle - stimulating hormone ( FSH ) which could possibly lead to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count .
5 . 9 Hepatic Adverse Effects Prolonged use of high doses of orally active 17 - alpha - alkyl androgens ( e . g . , methyltestosterone ) has been associated with serious hepatic adverse effects ( peliosis hepatis , hepatic neoplasms , cholestatic hepatitis , and jaundice ) .
Peliosis hepatis can be a life - threatening or fatal complication .
Long - term therapy with intramuscular testosterone enanthate , which elevates blood levels for prolonged periods , has produced multiple hepatic adenomas .
Testosterone gel 1 % is not known to cause these adverse effects .
Nonetheless , patients should be instructed to report any signs or symptoms of hepatic dysfunction ( e . g . , jaundice ) .
If these occur , promptly discontinue testosterone gel 1 % while the cause is evaluated .
5 . 10 Edema Androgens , including testosterone gel 1 % , may promote retention of sodium and water .
Edema , with or without congestive heart failure , may be a serious complication in patients with preexisting cardiac , renal , or hepatic disease .
In addition to discontinuation of the drug , diuretic therapy may be required .
5 . 11 Gynecomastia Gynecomastia occasionally develops and occasionally persists in patients being treated for hypogonadism [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 12 Sleep Apnea The treatment of hypogonadal men with testosterone may potentiate sleep apnea in some patients , especially those with risk factors such as obesity or chronic lung diseases .
5 . 13 Lipids Changes in the serum lipid profile may occur .
Monitor the lipid profile periodically , particularly after starting testosterone therapy and after dose increases .
5 . 14 Hypercalcemia Androgens , including testosterone gel 1 % , should be used with caution in cancer patients at risk of hypercalcemia ( and associated hypercalciuria ) .
Regular monitoring of serum calcium concentrations is recommended in these patients .
5 . 15 Decreased Thyroxine - binding Globulin Androgens , including testosterone gel 1 % , may decrease concentrations of thyroxine - binding globulins , resulting in decreased total T4 serum concentrations and increased resin uptake of T3 and T4 .
Free thyroid hormone concentrations remain unchanged , however , and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction .
5 . 16 Flammability Alcohol - based products , including testosterone gel 1 % , are flammable ; therefore , patients should be advised to avoid fire , flame or smoking until the testosterone gel 1 % has dried .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 2 % of the testosterone gel 1 % patients and greater than placebo ) are application site reaction and increased hematocrit .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Actavis at 1 - 888 - 838 - 2872 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In a controlled clinical study , 304 patients were treated with testosterone gel 1 % 50 mg or 100 mg or placebo gel for up to 90 days .
Two hundred five ( 205 ) patients received testosterone gel 1 % 50 mg or 100 mg daily and 99 patients received placebo .
Subjects could be counted in both testosterone gel 1 % treatment groups if they received both 50 mg and 100 mg at different points in the study and experienced an adverse reaction at both dose levels .
Adverse reactions reported by ≥ 1 % of the testosterone gel 1 % patients and greater than placebo are listed in Table 1 .
Table 1 : Incidence of Adverse Reactions ( Reported by ≥ 1 % of the Testosterone Gel 1 % Patients and Greater than Placebo ) in the Controlled Clinical Trial Through 90 DaysEvent Testosterone Gel 1 % Testosterone Gel 1 % Placebo 50 mg 100 mg ( n = 103 ) ( n = 149 ) ( n = 99 ) Application Site Reactions 2 % 4 % 3 % Blood Pressure Increased 1 % 1 % 0 % Gynecomastia 1 % 0 % 0 % Headache 1 % 1 % 0 % Hematocrit / hemoglobin Increased 1 % 2 % 0 % Hot Flushes 1 % 0 % 0 % Insomnia 1 % 0 % 0 % Mood Swings 1 % 0 % 0 % Smell Disorder 1 % 0 % 0 % Spontaneous Penile Erection 1 % 0 % 0 % Taste Disorder 1 % 1 % 0 % The following adverse reactions occurred in fewer than 1 % of patients but were greater in testosterone gel 1 % groups compared to the placebo group : activated partial thromboplastin time prolonged , blood creatinine increased , prothrombin time prolonged , appetite increased , sensitive nipples , and acne .
In this clinical trial of testosterone gel 1 % , 6 patients had adverse reactions that led to their discontinuation .
These events included : depression with suicidal ideation , urinary tract infection , mood swings and hypertension .
No testosterone gel 1 % patients discontinued due to skin reaction .
In one foreign Phase 3 trial , one subject discontinued due to a skin - related adverse reaction .
In the pivotal US and European Phase 3 trials combined , at the 50 - mg dosage strength , the percentage of subjects reporting clinically notable increases in hematocrit or hemoglobin were similar to placebo .
However , in the 100 - mg dose group , 2 . 3 % and 2 . 8 % of patients had a clinically notable increase in hemoglobin ( ≥ 19 g / dL ) or hematocrit ( ≥ 58 % ) , respectively , compared to 1 . 0 % and 1 . 5 % of patients in the placebo group , respectively .
In the combined US and European open - label extension studies , approximately 140 patients received testosterone gel 1 % for at least 6 months .
The results from these studies are consistent with those reported for the US controlled clinical trial .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of testosterone gel products .
Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Secondary Exposure to Testosterone in Children Cases of secondary exposure to testosterone resulting in virilization of children have been reported in postmarketing surveillance of testosterone gel products .
Signs and symptoms of these reported cases have included enlargement of the clitoris ( with surgical intervention ) or of the penis , development of pubic hair , increased erections and libido , aggressive behavior , and advanced bone age .
In most cases with a reported outcome , these signs and symptoms were reported to have regressed with removal of the testosterone gel exposure .
In a few cases , however , enlarged genitalia did not fully return to age - appropriate normal size , and bone age remained modestly greater than chronological age .
In some of the cases , direct contact with the sites of application on the skin of men using testosterone gel was reported .
In at least one reported case , the reporter considered the possibility of secondary exposure from items such as the testosterone gel user ’ s shirts and / or other fabric , such as towels and sheets [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Vascular Disorders Venous thromboembolism [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] Cardiovascular Disorders Myocardial infarction , stroke [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] Blood and Lymphatic Disorders Polycythemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Androgens may decrease blood glucose and therefore may decrease insulin requirements in diabetic patients .
( 7 . 1 ) • Changes in anticoagulant activity may be seen with androgens .
More frequent monitoring of international normalized ratio ( INR ) and prothrombin time is recommended in patients taking warfarin .
( 7 . 2 ) • Use of testosterone with corticosteroids may result in increased fluid retention .
Use with caution , particularly in patients with cardiac , renal , or hepatic disease .
( 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Insulin Changes in insulin sensitivity or glycemic control may occur in patients treated with androgens .
In diabetic patients , the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and , therefore , may necessitate a decrease in the dose of anti - diabetic medication .
7 . 2 Oral Anticoagulants Changes in anticoagulant activity may be seen with androgens , therefore more frequent monitoring of international normalized ratio ( INR ) and prothrombin time are recommended in patients taking warfarin , especially at the initiation and termination of androgen therapy .
7 . 3 Corticosteroids The concurrent use of testosterone with corticosteroids may result in increased fluid retention and requires careful monitoring particularly in patients with cardiac , renal or hepatic disease .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Geriatric Patients : There are insufficient long - term safety data to assess the potential risks of cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer .
( 8 . 5 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Testosterone gel 1 % is contraindicated in pregnant women .
Testosterone is teratogenic and may cause fetal harm based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
Exposure of a female fetus to androgens may result in varying degrees of virilization .
In animal development studies , exposure to testosterone in utero resulted in hormonal and behavioral changes in offspring and structural impairments of reproductive tissues in female and male offspring .
These studies did not meet current standards for nonclinical development toxicity studies .
Data Animal Data In developmental studies conducted in rats , rabbits , pigs , sheep , and rhesus monkeys , pregnant animals received intramuscular injection of testosterone during the period of organogenesis .
Testosterone treatment at doses that were comparable to those used for testosterone replacement therapy resulted in structural impairments in both female and male offspring .
Structural impairments observed in females included increased anogenital distance , phallus development , empty scrotum , no external vagina , intrauterine growth retardation , reduced ovarian reserve , and increased ovarian follicular recruitment .
Structural impairments seen in male offspring included increased testicular weight , larger seminal tubular lumen diameter , and higher frequency of occluded tubule lumen .
Increased pituitary weight was seen in both sexes .
Testosterone exposure in utero also resulted in hormonal and behavioral changes in offspring .
Hypertension was observed in pregnant female rats and their offspring exposed to doses approximately twice those used for testosterone replacement therapy .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Testosterone is not indicated for use in females .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility During treatment with large doses of exogenous androgens , including testosterone , spermatogenesis may be suppressed through feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic - pituitary - testicular axis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] , possible leading to adverse effects on semen parameters including sperm count .
Reduced fertility is observed in some men taking testosterone replacement therapy .
Testicular atrophy , subfertility , and infertility have also been reported in men who abuse anabolic androgenic steroids [ see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 . 2 ) ] .
With either type of use , the impact on fertility may be irreversible .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of testosterone gel 1 % in pediatric patients less than 18 years old have not been established .
Improper use may result in acceleration of bone age and premature closure of epiphyses .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use There is insufficient long - term safety data in geriatric patients to assess the potentially increased risks of cardiovascular disease and prostate cancer [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No studies were conducted in patients with renal impairment .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No studies were conducted in patients with hepatic impairment .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9 . 1 Controlled Substance Testosterone gel 1 % contains testosterone , a Schedule III controlled substance in the Controlled Substances Act .
9 . 2 Abuse Drug abuse is intentional non - therapeutic use of a drug , even once , for its rewarding psychological and physiological effects .
Abuse and misuse of testosterone are seen in male and female adults and adolescents .
Testosterone , often in combination with other anabolic androgenic steroids ( AAS ) , and not obtained by prescription through a pharmacy , may be abused by athletes and bodybuilders .
There have been reports of misuse of men taking higher doses of legally obtained testosterone than prescribed and continuing testosterone despite adverse events or against medical advice .
Abuse - Related Adverse Reactions Serious adverse reactions have been reported in individuals who abuse anabolic androgenic steroids , and include cardiac arrest , myocardial infarction , hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident , hepatotoxicity , and serious psychiatric manifestations , including major depression , mania , paranoia , psychosis , delusions , hallucinations , hostility , and aggression .
The following adverse reactions have also been reported in men : transient ischemic attacks , convulsions , hypomania , irritability , dyslipidemias , testicular atrophy , subfertility , and infertility .
The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in women : hirsutism , virilization , deepening of voice , clitoral enlargement , breast atrophy , male - pattern baldness , and menstrual irregularities .
The following adverse reactions have been reported in male and female adolescents : premature closure of bony epiphyses with termination of growth , and precocious puberty .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size and may include abuse of other agents , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
9 . 3 Dependence Behaviors Associated with Addiction Continued abuse of testosterone and other anabolic steroids , leading to addiction is characterized by the following behaviors : • Taking greater dosages than prescribed • Continued drug use despite medical and social problems due to drug use • Spending significant time to obtain the drug when supplies of the drug are interrupted • Giving a higher priority to drug use than other obligations • Having difficulty in discontinuing the drug despite desires and attempts to do so • Experiencing withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation of use Physical dependence is characterized by withdrawal symptoms after abrupt drug discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug .
Individuals taking supratherapeutic doses of testosterone may experience withdrawal symptoms lasting for weeks or months which include depressed mood , major depression , fatigue , craving , restlessness , irritability , anorexia , insomnia , decreased libido and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism .
Drug dependence in individuals using approved doses of testosterone for approved indications has not been documented .
10 OVERDOSAGE There were no reports of overdose in the testosterone gel 1 % clinical trials .
There is a single report in the literature of acute overdosage after injection of testosterone enanthate .
This subject had serum testosterone concentrations of up to 11 , 400 ng / dL , which were implicated in a cerebrovascular accident .
Treatment of overdosage would consist of discontinuation of testosterone gel 1 % , washing the application site with soap and water , and appropriate symptomatic and supportive care .
11 DESCRIPTION Testosterone Gel 1 % is a clear to translucent hydroalcoholic topical gel containing testosterone USP , an androgen .
Testosterone Gel 1 % provides continuous transdermal delivery of testosterone for 24 hours , following a single application to intact , clean , dry skin of the shoulders and / or upper arms .
One 5 - g tube of Testosterone Gel 1 % contains 50 mg of testosterone , USP to be applied daily to the skin ’ s surface .
Approximately 10 % of the applied testosterone dose is absorbed across skin of average permeability during a 24 - hour period .
The active pharmacological ingredient in Testosterone Gel 1 % is testosterone , USP .
Testosterone , USP is a white to practically white crystalline powder chemically described as 17 - β hydroxyandrost - 4 - en - 3 - one .
The structural formula is shown in the following figure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Testosterone Gel 1 % may have an alcoholic / musk odor .
Inactive ingredients in Testosterone Gel 1 % are carbomer copolymer type B , carbopol 980 , dehydrated alcohol ( 85 % v / v ) , glycerin , pentadecalactone , polyethylene glycol 1000 , propylene glycol , purified water , and tromethamine .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Endogenous androgens , including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) , are responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics .
These effects include the growth and maturation of prostate , seminal vesicles , penis and scrotum ; the development of male hair distribution , such as facial , pubic , chest and axillary hair ; laryngeal enlargement ; vocal cord thickening ; and alterations in body musculature and fat distribution .
Testosterone and DHT are necessary for the normal development of secondary sex characteristics .
Male hypogonadism , a clinical syndrome resulting from insufficient secretion of testosterone , has 2 main etiologies .
Primary hypogonadism is caused by defects of the gonads , such as Klinefelter ' s syndrome or Leydig cell aplasia , while secondary hypogonadism ( hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ) is the failure of the hypothalamus ( or pituitary ) to produce sufficient gonadotropins ( FSH , LH ) .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted using testosterone gel 1 % .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Testosterone gel 1 % delivers physiologic amounts of testosterone , producing circulating testosterone concentrations that approximate normal concentrations ( e . g . , 300 to 1000 ng / dL ) seen in healthy men .
The skin serves as a reservoir for the sustained release of testosterone into the systemic circulation .
Approximately 10 % of the testosterone applied on the skin surface is absorbed into the systemic circulation during a 24 - hour period .
Single Dose In single - dose studies , when either testosterone gel 1 % 50 mg or 100 mg was administered , absorption of testosterone into the blood continued for the entire 24 - hour dosing period .
Also , mean peak and average serum concentrations within the normal range were achieved within 24 hours .
Multiple Dose With single daily applications of testosterone gel 1 % 50 mg and 100 mg , follow - up measurements at 30 and 90 days after starting treatment have confirmed that serum testosterone and DHT concentrations are generally maintained within the normal range .
Figure 1 summarizes the 24 - hour pharmacokinetic profile of testosterone for patients maintained on testosterone gel 1 % 50 mg or testosterone gel 1 % 100 mg for 30 days .
Figure 1 : Mean Steady - State Serum Testosterone ( ± SD ) ( ng / dL ) Concentrations on Day 30 in Patients Applying Testosterone gel 1 % Once Daily [ MULTIMEDIA ] The average daily testosterone concentration produced by testosterone gel 1 % 100 mg at Day 30 was 612 ( ± 286 ) ng / dL and by testosterone gel 1 % 50 mg at Day 30 was 365 ( ± 187 ) ng / dL .
Distribution Circulating testosterone is primarily bound in the serum to sex hormone - binding globulin ( SHBG ) and albumin .
Approximately 40 % of testosterone in plasma is bound to SHBG , 2 % remains unbound ( free ) and the rest is loosely bound to albumin and other proteins .
Metabolism Testosterone is metabolized to various 17 - keto steroids through 2 different pathways .
The major active metabolites of testosterone are estradiol and DHT .
The average daily DHT concentration produced by testosterone gel 1 % 100 mg at Day 30 was 555 ( ± 293 ) pg / mL and by testosterone gel 1 % 50 mg at Day 30 was 346 ( ± 212 ) pg / mL .
Figure 2 summarizes the 24 - hour pharmacokinetic profile of DHT for patients maintained on testosterone gel 1 % 50 mg or testosterone gel 1 % 100 mg for 30 days .
Figure 2 : Mean Steady - State Serum Dihydrotestosterone ( ± SD ) ( pg / mL ) Concentrations on Day 30 in Patients Applying Testosterone Gel 1 % Once Daily [ MULTIMEDIA ] Excretion There is considerable variation in the half - life of testosterone concentration as reported in the literature , ranging from 10 to 100 minutes .
About 90 % of a dose of testosterone given intramuscularly is excreted in the urine as glucuronic acid and sulfuric acid conjugates of testosterone and its metabolites .
About 6 % of a dose is excreted in the feces , mostly in the unconjugated form .
Inactivation of testosterone occurs primarily in the liver .
Potential for Testosterone Transfer from Male Patients to Female Partners The potential for dermal testosterone transfer following testosterone gel 1 % use was evaluated in two clinical trials with males dosed with testosterone gel 1 % and their untreated female partners .
In the first trial , 30 couples were evenly randomized to 5 groups .
In the first 4 groups , 100 mg of testosterone gel 1 % was applied to the male abdomen and the couples were then asked to rub abdomen - to - abdomen for 15 minutes at 1 hour , 4 hours , 8 hours , or 12 hours after dose application , respectively .
In these couples , serum testosterone concentrations in female partners increased from baseline by at least 6 times and potential for transfer was seen at all time points .
When 6 males used a shirt to cover the abdomen at 15 minutes post - application and partners again rubbed abdomens for 15 minutes at the 1 - hour time point , serum testosterone concentrations in female partners increased from baseline by approximately 3 times .
In the second trial , 24 couples were evenly randomized to 4 groups .
Testosterone gel 1 % 100 mg was applied to the male upper arms and shoulders .
In one group , 15 minutes of direct skin - to - skin rubbing began at 4 hours after application .
In these 6 women , all of whom showered immediately after the rubbing activity , mean maximum serum testosterone concentrations increased from baseline by approximately 4 times .
When males wore a long - sleeved T - shirt and rubbing was started at 1 and at 4 hours after application , the transfer of testosterone from male to female partners was prevented .
Effect of Showering The effect of showering ( with mild soap ) at 1 , 2 , and 6 hours post application of testosterone gel 1 % 100 mg was evaluated in a clinical trial in 12 men .
The study demonstrated that the overall effect of washing was to decrease testosterone concentrations ; however , when washing occurred 2 or more hours post drug application , serum testosterone concentrations remained within the normal range .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Testosterone has been tested by subcutaneous injection and implantation in mice and rats .
In mice , the implant induced cervical - uterine tumors , which metastasized in some cases .
There is suggestive evidence that injection of testosterone into some strains of female mice increases their susceptibility to hepatoma .
Testosterone is also known to increase the number of tumors and decrease the degree of differentiation of chemically induced carcinomas of the liver in rats .
Mutagenesis Testosterone was negative in the in vitro Ames and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assays .
Impairment of Fertility The administration of exogenous testosterone has been reported to suppress spermatogenesis in the rat , dog , and non - human primates , which was reversible on cessation of the treatment .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Clinical Trials in Adult Hypogonadal Males Testosterone gel 1 % was evaluated in a randomized multicenter , multi - dose , active and placebo controlled 90 - day study in 406 adult males with morning testosterone concentrations ≤ 300 ng / dL .
The study was double - blind for the doses of testosterone gel 1 % and placebo , but open - label for the non - scrotal testosterone transdermal system .
During the first 60 days , patients were evenly randomized to testosterone gel 1 % 50 mg , testosterone gel 1 % 100 mg , placebo gel , or testosterone transdermal system .
At Day 60 , patients receiving testosterone gel 1 % were maintained at the same dose , or were titrated up or down within their treatment group , based on 24 - hour averaged serum testosterone concentration obtained on Day 30 .
Of 192 hypogonadal men who were appropriately titrated with testosterone gel 1 % and who had sufficient data for analysis , 74 % achieved an average serum testosterone concentration within the normal range ( 300 to 1 , 000 ng / dL ) on treatment Day 90 .
Table 2 summarizes the mean testosterone concentrations on Day 30 for patients receiving testosterone gel 1 % 50 mg or 100 mg .
