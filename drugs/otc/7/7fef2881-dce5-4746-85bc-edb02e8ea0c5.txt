There have been rare reports of serious cardiac adverse reactions , including acute myocardial infarction , occurring within a few hours following administration of sumatriptan injection .
Some of these reactions occurred in patients without known CAD .
Sumatriptan injection may cause coronary artery vasospasm ( Prinzmetal ' s angina ) , even in patients without a history of CAD .
Perform a cardiovascular evaluation in triptan - naive patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors ( e . g . , increased age , diabetes , hypertension , smoking , obesity , strong family history of CAD ) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection .
If there is evidence of CAD or coronary artery vasospasm , sumatriptan injection is contraindicated .
For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation , consider administering the first dose of sumatriptan injection in a medically supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram ( ECG ) immediately following administration of sumatriptan injection .
For such patients , consider periodic cardiovascular evaluation in intermittent long - term users of sumatriptan injection .
5 . 2 Arrhythmias Life - threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythm , including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation leading to death , have been reported within a few hours following the administration of 5 - HT1 agonists .
Discontinue sumatriptan injection if these disturbances occur .
Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with Wolff - Parkinson - White syndrome or arrhythmias associated with other cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders .
5 . 3 Chest , Throat , Neck , and / or Jaw Pain / Tightness / Pressure Sensations of tightness , pain , pressure , and heaviness in the precordium , throat , neck , and jaw commonly occur after treatment with sumatriptan injection and are usually non - cardiac in origin .
However , perform a cardiac evaluation if these patients are at high cardiac risk .
The use of sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with CAD and those with Prinzmetal ' s variant angina .
5 . 4 Cerebrovascular Events Cerebral hemorrhage , subarachnoid hemorrhage , and stroke have occurred in patients treated with 5 - HT1 agonists , and some have resulted in fatalities .
In a number of cases , it appears possible that the cerebrovascular events were primary , the 5 - HT1 agonist having been administered in the incorrect belief that the symptoms experienced were a consequence of migraine when they were not .
Also , patients with migraine may be at increased risk of certain cerebrovascular events ( e . g . , stroke , hemorrhage , TIA ) .
Discontinue sumatriptan injection if a cerebrovascular event occurs .
Before treating headaches in patients not previously diagnosed with migraine or cluster headache or in patients who present with atypical symptoms , exclude other potentially serious neurological conditions .
Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or TIA .
5 . 5 Other Vasospasm Reactions Sumatriptan injection may cause non - coronary vasospastic reactions , such as peripheral vascular ischemia , gastrointestinal vascular ischemia and infarction ( presenting with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea ) , splenic infarction , and Raynaud ' s syndrome .
In patients who experience symptoms or signs suggestive of non - coronary vasospasm reaction following the use of any 5 - HT1 agonist , rule out a vasospastic reaction before receiving additional sumatriptan injection .
Reports of transient and permanent blindness and significant partial vision loss have been reported with the use of 5 - HT1 agonists .
Since visual disorders may be part of a migraine attack , a causal relationship between these events and the use of 5 - HT1 agonists have not been clearly established .
5 . 6 Medication Overuse Headache Overuse of acute migraine drugs ( e . g . , ergotamine , triptans , opioids , or combination of these drugs for 10 or more days per month ) may lead to exacerbation of headache ( medication overuse headache ) .
Medication overuse headache may present as migraine - like daily headaches , or as a marked increase in frequency of migraine attacks .
Detoxification of patients , including withdrawal of the overused drugs , and treatment of withdrawal symptoms ( which often includes a transient worsening of headache ) may be necessary .
5 . 7 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin syndrome may occur with sumatriptan injection , particularly during co - administration with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) , tricyclic antidepressants ( TCAs ) , and MAO inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) ] .
Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes ( e . g . , agitation , hallucinations , coma ) , autonomic instability ( e . g . , tachycardia , labile blood pressure , hyperthermia ) , neuromuscular aberrations ( e . g . , hyperreflexia , incoordination ) , and / or gastrointestinal symptoms ( e . g . , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ) .
The onset of symptoms usually occurs within minutes to hours of receiving a new or a greater dose of a serotonergic medication .
Discontinue sumatriptan injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected .
5 . 8 Increase in Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure , including hypertensive crisis with acute impairment of organ systems , has been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with 5 - HT1 agonists , including patients without a history of hypertension .
Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with sumatriptan injection .
Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension .
5 . 9 Anaphylactic / Anaphylactoid Reactions Anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions have occurred in patients receiving sumatriptan .
Such reactions can be life threatening or fatal .
In general , anaphylactic reactions to drugs are more likely to occur in individuals with a history of sensitivity to multiple allergens .
Sumatriptan injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reaction to sumatriptan .
5 . 10 Seizures Seizures have been reported following administration of sumatriptan .
Some have occurred in patients with either a history of seizures or concurrent conditions predisposing to seizures .
There are also reports in patients where no such predisposing factors are apparent .
Sumatriptan injection should be used with caution in patients with a history of epilepsy or conditions associated with a lowered seizure threshold .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling : • • Myocardial ischemia , myocardial infarction , and Prinzmetal ' s angina [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Arrhythmias [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • • Chest , throat , neck , and / or jaw pain / tightness / pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • • Cerebrovascular events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • • Other vasospasm reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • • Medication overuse headache [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • • Serotonin syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] • • Increase in blood pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] • • Hypersensitivity reactions [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] • • Seizures [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 5 % and > placebo ) were injection site reactions , tingling , dizziness / vertigo , warm / hot sensation , burning sensation , feeling of heaviness , pressure sensation , flushing , feeling of tightness , and numbness ( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Wockhardt USA LLC .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Migraine Headache Table 1 lists adverse reactions that occurred in 2 U . S . placebo - controlled clinical trials in migraine patients ( Studies 2 and 3 ) following either a single 6 - mg dose of sumatriptan injection or placebo .
Only reactions that occurred at a frequency of 2 % or more in groups treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg and that occurred at a frequency greater than the placebo group are included in Table 1 .
Table 1 .
Adverse Reactions in Pooled Placebo - Controlled Trials in Patients with Migraine ( Studies 2 and 3 ) a Includes injection site pain , stinging / burning , swelling , erythema , bruising , bleeding .
Adverse Reaction Percent of Subjects Reporting Sumatriptan Injection 6 mg Subcutaneous ( n = 547 ) Placebo ( n = 370 ) Atypical sensations 42 9 Tingling 14 3 Warm / hot sensation 11 4 Burning sensation 7 < 1 Feeling of heaviness 7 1 Pressure sensation 7 2 Feeling of tightness 5 < 1 Numbness 5 2 Feeling strange 2 < 1 Tight feeling in head 2 < 1 Cardiovascular Flushing 7 2 Chest discomfort 5 1 Tightness in chest 3 < 1 Pressure in chest 2 < 1 Ear , nose , and throat Throat discomfort 3 < 1 Discomfort : nasal cavity / sinuses 2 < 1 Injection site reactiona 59 24 Miscellaneous Jaw discomfort 2 0 Musculoskeletal Weakness 5 < 1 Neck pain / stiffness 5 < 1 Myalgia 2 < 1 Neurological Dizziness / vertigo 12 4 Drowsiness / sedation 3 2 Headache 2 < 1 Skin Sweating 2 1 The incidence of adverse reactions in controlled clinical trials was not affected by gender or age of the patients .
There were insufficient data to assess the impact of race on the incidence of adverse reactions .
Cluster Headache In the controlled clinical trials assessing the efficacy of sumatriptan injection as a treatment for cluster headache ( Studies 4 and 5 ) , no new significant adverse reactions were detected that had not already been identified in trials of sumatriptan injection in patients with migraine .
Overall , the frequency of adverse reactions reported in the trials of cluster headache was generally lower than in the migraine trials .
Exceptions include reports of paresthesia ( 5 % sumatriptan injection , 0 % placebo ) , nausea and vomiting ( 4 % sumatriptan injection , 0 % placebo ) , and bronchospasm ( 1 % sumatriptan injection , 0 % placebo ) .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sumatriptan tablets , sumatriptan nasal spray , and sumatriptan injection .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Cardiovascular Hypotension , palpitations .
Neurological Dystonia , tremor .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Ergot - containing Drugs Ergot - containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions .
Because these effects may be additive , use of ergotamine - containing or ergot - type medications ( like dihydroergotamine or methysergide ) and sumatriptan injection within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated .
7 . 2 Monoamine Oxidase - A Inhibitors MAO - A inhibitors increase systemic exposure by 2 - fold .
Therefore , the use of sumatriptan injection in patients receiving MAO - A inhibitors is contraindicated [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 3 Other 5 - HT1 Agonists Because their vasospastic effects may be additive , co - administration of sumatriptan injection and other 5 - HT1 agonists ( e . g . , triptans ) within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated .
7 . 4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors / Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Syndrome Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during co - administration of triptans and SSRIs , SNRIs , TCAs , and MAO inhibitors [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : Based on animal data , may cause fetal harm ( 8 . 1 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C .
There are no adequate and well - controlled trials of sumatriptan injection in pregnant women .
In developmental toxicity studies in rats and rabbits , oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant animals was associated with embryolethality , fetal abnormalities , and pup mortality .
When administered by the intravenous route to pregnant rabbits , sumatriptan was embryolethal .
Sumatriptan injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of fetal blood vessel ( cervicothoracic and umbilical ) abnormalities .
The highest no - effect dose for embryofetal developmental toxicity in rats was 60 mg / kg / day , or approximately 100 times the single maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on a mg / m2basis .
Oral administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased incidences of embryolethality and fetal cervicothoracic vascular and skeletal abnormalities .
Intravenous administration of sumatriptan to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in an increased incidence of embryolethality .
The highest oral and intravenous no - effect doses for developmental toxicity in rabbits were 15 and 0 . 75 mg / kg / day , or approximately 50 and 2 times , respectively , the single MRHD of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on a mg / m2basis .
Oral administration of sumatriptan to rats prior to and throughout gestation resulted in embryofetal toxicity ( decreased body weight , decreased ossification , increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities ) .
The highest no - effect dose was 50 mg / kg / day , or approximately 80 times the single MRHD of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on a mg / m2basis .
In offspring of pregnant rats treated orally with sumatriptan during organogenesis , there was a decrease in pup survival .
The highest no - effect dose for this effect was 60 mg / kg / day , or approximately 100 times the single MRHD of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on a mg / m2basis .
Oral treatment of pregnant rats with sumatriptan during the latter part of gestation and throughout lactation resulted in a decrease in pup survival .
The highest no - effect dose for this finding was 100 mg / kg / day , or approximately 160 times the single MRHD of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on a mg / m2basis .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Sumatriptan is excreted in human milk following subcutaneous administration .
Infant exposure to sumatriptan can be minimized by avoiding breastfeeding for 12 hours after treatment with sumatriptan injection .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Sumatriptan injection is not recommended for use in patients younger than 18 years of age .
Two controlled clinical trials evaluated sumatriptan nasal spray ( 5 to 20 mg ) in 1 , 248 pediatric migraineurs 12 to 17 years of age who treated a single attack .
The trials did not establish the efficacy of sumatriptan nasal spray compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients .
Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults .
Five controlled clinical trials ( 2 single - attack trials , 3 multiple - attack trials ) evaluating oral sumatriptan ( 25 to 100 mg ) in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age enrolled a total of 701 pediatric migraineurs .
These trials did not establish the efficacy of oral sumatriptan compared with placebo in the treatment of migraine in pediatric patients .
Adverse reactions observed in these clinical trials were similar in nature to those reported in clinical trials in adults .
The frequency of all adverse reactions in these patients appeared to be both dose - and age - dependent , with younger patients reporting reactions more commonly than older pediatric patients .
Postmarketing experience documents that serious adverse reactions have occurred in the pediatric population after use of subcutaneous , oral , and / or intranasal sumatriptan .
These reports include reactions similar in nature to those reported rarely in adults , including stroke , visual loss , and death .
A myocardial infarction has been reported in a 14 - year - old male following the use of oral sumatriptan ; clinical signs occurred within 1 day of drug administration .
Clinical data to determine the frequency of serious adverse reactions in pediatric patients who might receive subcutaneous , oral , or intranasal sumatriptan are not presently available .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of sumatriptan injection did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
A cardiovascular evaluation is recommended for geriatric patients who have other cardiovascular risk factors ( e . g . , diabetes , hypertension , smoking , obesity , strong family history of CAD ) prior to receiving sumatriptan injection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Coronary vasospasm was observed after intravenous administration of sumatriptan injection [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Overdoses would be expected from animal data ( dogs at 0 . 1 g / kg , rats at 2 g / kg ) to possibly cause convulsions , tremor , inactivity , erythema of the extremities , reduced respiratory rate , cyanosis , ataxia , mydriasis , injection site reactions ( desquamation , hair loss , and scab formation ) , and paralysis .
The elimination half - life of sumatriptan is about 2 hours [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] ; therefore , monitoring of patients after overdose with sumatriptan injection should continue for at least 10 hours or while symptoms or signs persist .
It is unknown what effect hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has on the serum concentrations of sumatriptan .
11 DESCRIPTION Sumatriptan injection , USP contains sumatriptan succinate , a selective 5 - HT1B / 1 D receptor agonist .
Sumatriptan succinate is chemically designated as 3 - [ 2 - ( dimethylamino ) ethyl ] - N - methyl - indole - 5 - methanesulfonamide succinate ( 1 : 1 ) , and it has the following structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The molecular formula is C14H21N3O2S • C4H6O4 , representing a molecular weight of 413 . 5 .
Sumatriptan succinate , USP is a white or almost white powder that is readily soluble in water and in saline .
Sumatriptan injection , USP is a clear , colorless to pale yellow , sterile , nonpyrogenic solution for subcutaneous injection .
Each 0 . 5 mL of sumatriptan injection , 12 mg / mL contains 6 mg of sumatriptan ( base ) as the succinate salt and 3 . 5 mg of sodium chloride , USP in Water for Injection , USP .
The pH range of solution is approximately 4 . 2 to 5 . 3 .
The osmolality of injection is in between 270 to 330 mOsmol .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Sumatriptan binds with high affinity to human cloned 5 - HT1B / 1 D receptors .
Sumatriptan presumably exerts its therapeutic effects in the treatment of migraine and cluster headaches through agonist effects at the 5 - HT1B / 1 D receptors on intracranial blood vessels and sensory nerves of the trigeminal system , which result in cranial vessel constriction and inhibition of pro - inflammatory neuropeptide release .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Blood Pressure Significant elevation in blood pressure , including hypertensive crisis , has been reported in patients with and without a history of hypertension [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] .
Peripheral ( Small ) Arteries In healthy volunteers ( N = 18 ) , a trial evaluating the effects of sumatriptan on peripheral ( small vessel ) arterial reactivity failed to detect a clinically significant increase in peripheral resistance .
Heart Rate Transient increases in blood pressure observed in some patients in clinical trials carried out during sumatriptan ' s development as a treatment for migraine were not accompanied by any clinically significant changes in heart rate .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Bioavailability The bioavailability of sumatriptan via subcutaneous site injection to 18 healthy male subjects was 97 % ± 16 % of that obtained following intravenous injection .
After a single 6 - mg subcutaneous manual injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 18 healthy males ( age : 24 ± 6 years , weight : 70 kg ) , the maximum serum concentration ( Cmax ) of sumatriptan was ( mean ± standard deviation ) 74 ± 15 ng / mL and the time to peak concentration ( Tmax ) was 12 minutes after injection ( range : 5 to 20 minutes ) .
In this trial , the same dose injected subcutaneously in the thigh gave a Cmax of 61 ± 15 ng / mL by manual injection versus 52 ± 15 ng / mL by autoinjector techniques .
The Tmax or amount absorbed was not significantly altered by either the site or technique of injection .
Distribution Protein binding , determined by equilibrium dialysis over the concentration range of 10 to 1 , 000 ng / mL is low , approximately 14 % to 21 % .
The effect of sumatriptan on the protein binding of other drugs has not been evaluated .
Following a 6 - mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm in 9 males ( mean age : 33 years , mean weight : 77 kg ) the volume of distribution central compartment of sumatriptan was 50 ± 8 liters and the distribution half - life was 15 ± 2 minutes .
Metabolism In vitro studies with human microsomes suggest that sumatriptan is metabolized by MAO , predominantly the A isoenzyme .
Most of a radiolabeled dose of sumatriptan excreted in the urine is the major metabolite indole acetic acid ( IAA ) or the IAA glucuronide , both of which are inactive .
Elimination After a single 6 - mg subcutaneous dose , 22 % ± 4 % was excreted in the urine as unchanged sumatriptan and 38 % ± 7 % as the IAA metabolite .
Following a 6 - mg subcutaneous injection into the deltoid area of the arm , the systemic clearance of sumatriptan was 1 , 194 ± 149 mL / min and the terminal half - life was 115 ± 19 minutes .
Specific Populations Age The pharmacokinetics of sumatriptan in the elderly ( mean age : 72 years , 2 males and 4 females ) and in subjects with migraine ( mean age : 38 years , 25 males and 155 females ) were similar to that in healthy male subjects ( mean age : 30 years ) .
Hepatic Impairment The effect of mild to moderate hepatic disease on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan has been evaluated .
There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in moderately hepatically impaired subjects compared with healthy controls .
The pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered sumatriptan in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied .
The use of sumatriptan injection in this population is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Race The systemic clearance and Cmax of subcutaneous sumatriptan were similar in black ( n = 34 ) and Caucasian ( n = 38 ) healthy male subjects .
Drug Interaction Studies Monoamine Oxidase - A Inhibitors In a trial of 14 healthy females , pretreatment with an MAO - A inhibitor decreased the clearance of subcutaneous sumatriptan , resulting in a 2 - fold increase in the area under the sumatriptan plasma concentration - time curve ( AUC ) , corresponding to a 40 % increase in elimination half - life .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In carcinogenicity studies in mouse and rat in which sumatriptan was administered orally for 78 weeks and 104 weeks , respectively , at doses up to 160 mg / kg / day ( the highest dose in rat was reduced from 360 mg / kg / day during Week 21 ) .
The highest dose to mice and rats was approximately 130 and 260 times the single MRHD of 6 mg administered subcutaneously on a mg / m2basis .
There was no evidence in either species of an increase in tumors related to sumatriptan administration .
Mutagenesis Sumatriptan was negative in in vitro ( bacterial reverse mutation [ Ames ] , gene cell mutation in Chinese hamster V79 / HGPRT , chromosomal aberration in human lymphocytes ) and in vivo ( rat micronucleus ) assays .
Impairment of Fertility When sumatriptan was administered by subcutaneous injection to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period , there was no evidence of impaired fertility at doses up to 60 mg / kg / day or approximately 100 times the single human dose of 6 mg on a mg / m2basis .
When sumatriptan ( 5 , 50 , 500 mg / kg / day ) was administered orally to male and female rats prior to and throughout the mating period , there was a treatment - related decrease in fertility secondary to a decrease in mating in animals treated with doses greater than 5 mg / kg / day .
It is not clear whether this finding was due to an effect on males or females or both .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Corneal Opacities Dogs receiving oral sumatriptan developed corneal opacities and defects in the corneal epithelium .
Corneal opacities were seen at the lowest dose tested , 2 mg / kg / day , and were present after 1 month of treatment .
Defects in the corneal epithelium were noted in a 60 - week study .
Earlier examinations for these toxicities were not conducted and no - effect doses were not established ; however , the relative plasma exposure at the lowest dose tested was approximately 3 times the human exposure after a 6 - mg subcutaneous dose .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Migraine In controlled clinical trials enrolling more than 1 , 000 patients during migraine attacks who were experiencing moderate or severe pain and 1 or more of the symptoms enumerated in Table 3 , onset of relief began as early as 10 minutes following a 6 - mg sumatriptan injection .
Lower doses of sumatriptan injection may also prove effective , although the proportion of patients obtaining adequate relief was decreased and the latency to that relief is greater with lower doses .
In Study 1 , 6 different doses of sumatriptan injection ( n = 30 each group ) were compared with placebo ( n = 62 ) , in a single - attack , parallel - group design , the dose - response relationship was found to be as shown in Table 2 .
Table 2 .
Proportion of Patients with Migraine Relief and Incidence of Adverse Reactions by Time and by Sumatriptan Injection Dose in Study 1 a Relief is defined as the reduction of moderate or severe pain to no or mild pain after dosing without use of rescue medication .
Dose of Percent Patients with Relief a Adverse Sumatriptan Injection at 10 Minutes at 30 Minutes at 1 Hour at 2 Hours Reactions Incidence ( % ) Placebo 5 15 24 21 55 1 mg 10 40 43 40 63 2 mg 7 23 57 43 63 3 mg 17 47 57 60 77 4 mg 13 37 50 57 80 6 mg 10 63 73 70 83 8 mg 23 57 80 83 93 In 2 randomized , placebo - controlled clinical trials of sumatriptan injection 6 mg in 1 , 104 patients with moderate or severe migraine pain ( Studies 2 and 3 ) , the onset of relief was less than 10 minutes .
Headache relief , as defined by a reduction in pain from severe or moderately severe to mild or no headache , was achieved in 70 % of the patients within 1 hour of a single 6 - mg subcutaneous dose of sumatriptan injection .
Approximately 82 % and 65 % of patients treated with sumatriptan injection 6 mg had headache relief and were pain free within 2 hours , respectively .

The efficacy of sumatriptan injection was unaffected by whether or not the migraine was associated with aura , duration of attack , gender or age of the patient , or concomitant use of common migraine prophylactic drugs ( e . g . , beta - blockers ) .
14 . 2 Cluster Headache The efficacy of sumatriptan injection in the acute treatment of cluster headache was demonstrated in 2 randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , 2 - period crossover trials ( Studies 4 and 5 ) .
Patients 21 to 65 years of age were enrolled and were instructed to treat a moderate to very severe headache within 10 minutes of onset .
Headache relief was defined as a reduction in headache severity to mild or no pain .
In both trials , the proportion of individuals gaining relief at 10 or 15 minutes was significantly greater among patients receiving 6 mg of sumatriptan injection compared with those who received placebo ( see Table 4 ) .

Figure 1 .
Time to Relief of Cluster Headache from Time of Injectiona [ MULTIMEDIA ] a The figure uses Kaplan - Meier ( product limit ) Survivorship Plot .
Patients taking rescue medication were censored at 15 minutes .
The plot was constructed with data from patients who either experienced relief or did not require ( request ) rescue medication within a period of 2 hours following treatment .
As a consequence , the data in the plot are derived from only a subset of the 258 headaches treated ( rescue medication was required in 52 of the 127 placebo - treated headaches and 18 of the 131 headaches treated with sumatriptan injection ) .
Other data suggest that treatment with sumatriptan injection is not associated with an increase in early recurrence of headache and has little effect on the incidence of later - occurring headaches ( i . e . , those occurring after 2 , but before 18 or 24 hours ) .
