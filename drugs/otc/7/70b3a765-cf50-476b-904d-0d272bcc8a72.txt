( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS TPOXX Capsules : None .
TPOXX Injection : The excipient hydroxypropyl - β - cyclodextrin is eliminated through glomerular filtration .
Therefore , TPOXX Injection is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment ( defined as creatinine clearance below 30 mL / min ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
• TPOXX capsules : None • TPOXX injection : TPOXX Injection is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment ( defined as creatinine clearance below 30 mL / min ) ( 4 , 5 . 2 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypoglycemia : Co - administration with repaglinide may cause hypoglycemia .
Monitor blood glucose and monitor for hypoglycemic symptoms during co - administration .
( 5 . 1 ) 5 . 1 Hypoglycemia When Co - Administered with Repaglinide Co - administration of repaglinide and tecovirimat may cause mild to moderate hypoglycemia .
Monitor blood glucose and monitor for hypoglycemic symptoms when administering TPOXX with repaglinide [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In a drug interaction study , 10 of 30 healthy subjects experienced mild ( 6 subjects ) or moderate ( 4 subjects ) hypoglycemia following co - administration of repaglinide ( 2 mg ) and TPOXX .
Symptoms resolved in all subjects after intake of food and / or oral glucose .
5 . 2 Risks of Hydroxypropyl - β - Cyclodextrin Excipient for Patients with Renal Insufficiency and Pediatric Patients < 2 Years of Age Patients with renal insufficiency TPOXX Injection : In healthy patients and in patients with mild to severe renal insufficiency , the majority of an 8 g dose of hydroxypropyl - β - cyclodextrin ( per 200 mg tecovirimat / 20 mL solution ) is eliminated in the urine .
It is known that clearance of hydroxypropyl - β - cyclodextrin is reduced in patients with mild , moderate , and severe renal impairment , resulting in higher exposure to hydroxypropyl - β - cyclodextrin ; in these patients , half - life values are increased over normal values by approximately two - , four - , and six - fold , respectively .
In these patients , successive infusions may result in accumulation of hydroxypropyl - β - cyclodextrin until steady state is reached .
In patients with mild ( defined as creatinine clearance 60 - 89 mL / min ) and moderate ( defined as creatinine clearance 30 - 59 mL / min ) renal impairment , TPOXX Injection should be used with caution .
Creatinine clearance should be closely monitored and , if renal toxicity is suspected , consideration should be given to administering TPOXX orally if possible or to using an alternative medication .
TPOXX Injection is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance 30 mL / min ) [ see Contraindictions ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Pediatric patients TPOXX Injection : In pediatric patients less than 2 years of age , there are limited data regarding the use of hydroxypropyl - β - cyclodextrin .
Given that renal tubular function rapidly matures over the first few years of life , clearance of hydroxypropyl - β - cyclodextrin may be reduced in young pediatric patients , resulting in higher exposure to hydroxypropyl - β - cyclodextrin .
TPOXX Injection should be used with caution in this population given that animal studies have shown potential for nephrotoxicity at very high exposure levels of hydroxypropyl - β - cyclodextrin .
Given the potential for drug accumulation due to renal immaturity in pediatric patients less than 2 years , monitoring of renal function after treatment is recommended [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions are : • TPOXX Capsules ( incidence ≥ 2 % ) : headache , nausea , abdominal pain , and vomiting .

( 5 . 1 , 7 , 12 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Effect of TPOXX on Other Drugs Tecovirimat is a weak inducer of cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3 A and a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP2C19 .
However , the effects are not expected to be clinically relevant for most substrates of those enzymes based on the magnitude of interactions and the duration of treatment of TPOXX .
See Table 5 for clinical recommendations for select sensitive substrates .
7 . 2 Established Drug Interactions Table 5 provides a listing of established or significant drug interactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

7 . 3 Drugs Without Clinically Significant Interactions With TPOXX Based on a drug interaction study , no clinically significant drug interactions have been observed when TPOXX is co - administered with bupropion , flurbiprofen , or omeprazole [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 4 Vaccine Interactions No vaccine - drug interaction studies have been performed in human subjects .
Some animal studies have indicated that co - administration of TPOXX at the same time as live smallpox vaccine ( vaccinia virus ) may reduce the immune response to the vaccine .
The clinical impact of this interaction on vaccine efficacy is unknown .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Breastfeeding is not recommended in patients with smallpox .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on the use of tecovirimat in pregnant individuals to evaluate for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , and other adverse maternal and fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , no embryofetal developmental toxicity was observed in mice during the period of organogenesis at tecovirimat exposures ( area under the curve [ AUC ] ) up to 23 times higher than human exposure at the recommended human dose ( RHD ) .
In rabbits , no embryofetal developmental toxicity was observed during organogenesis at tecovirimat exposures ( AUC ) less than human exposures at the RHD .
In a mouse pre - / post - natal development study , no toxicities were observed at maternal tecovirimat exposures up to 24 times higher than human exposure at the RHD ( see Data ) .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown , and the estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is higher than the general population .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Tecovirimat was administered orally to pregnant mice at doses up to 1 , 000 mg / kg / day from gestation Days 6 - 15 .
No embryofetal toxicities were observed at doses up to 1 , 000 mg / kg / day ( approximately 23 times higher than human exposure at the RHD ) .
Tecovirimat was administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses up to 100 mg / kg / day from gestation Days 6 - 19 .
No embryofetal toxicities were observed at doses up to 100 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 4 times the human exposure at the RHD ) .
In the pre - / post - natal development study , tecovirimat was administered orally to pregnant mice at doses up to 1 , 000 mg / kg / day from gestation Day 6 to post - natal Day 20 .
No toxicities were observed at doses up to 1 , 000 mg / kg / day ( approximately 24 times higher than human exposure at the RHD ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Because of the potential for variola virus transmission through direct contact with the breastfed infant , breastfeeding is not recommended in patients with smallpox .
There are no data on the presence of tecovirimat in human milk , the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant , or on milk production .
Tecovirimat was present in animal milk ( see Data ) .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely to be present in human milk .
Data In a lactation study at doses up to 1 , 000 mg / kg / day , mean tecovirimat milk to plasma ratios up to approximately 0 . 8 were observed at 6 and 24 hours post - dose when administered orally to mice on lactation Day 10 or 11 .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility There are no data on the effect of tecovirimat on human fertility .
Decreased fertility due to testicular toxicity was observed in male mice [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use As in adults , the effectiveness of TPOXX in pediatric patients is based solely on efficacy studies in animal models of orthopoxvirus disease .
As exposure of healthy pediatric subjects to TPOXX with no potential for direct clinical benefit is not ethical , pharmacokinetic simulation was used to derive dosing regimens that are predicted to provide pediatric patients with exposures comparable to the observed exposure in adults receiving 600 mg orally twice daily ( every 12 hours ) or 200 mg intravenously twice daily ( every 12 hours ) .
The dosage for pediatric patients is based on weight [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
TPOXX Injection : There are limited data regarding the use of hydroxypropyl - β - cyclodextrin , an ingredient in TPOXX injection , in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age .
Given the potential for drug accumulation due to renal immaturity in pediatric patients less than 2 years , monitoring of renal function after treatment is recommended [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of TPOXX did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether the safety profile of TPOXX is different in this population compared to younger subjects .
Of the 359 subjects in the clinical study of TPOXX , 10 % ( 36 / 359 ) were ≥ 65 years of age , and 1 % ( 4 / 359 ) were ≥ 75 years of age .
No alteration of dosing is needed for patients ≥ 65 years of age [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment TPOXX Capsules : No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild , moderate or severe renal impairment or patients with end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) requiring hemodialysis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
TPOXX Injection : Hydroxypropyl - β - cyclodextrin , an ingredient in TPOXX injection , when administered intravenously , is eliminated through glomerular filtration .
No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild ( creatinine clearance 60 - 89 mL / min ) or moderate ( creatinine clearance 30 - 59 mL / min ) renal impairment .
TPOXX Injection is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance below 30 mL / min ) [ see Contraindictions ( 4 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild , moderate or severe hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh Class A , B , or C ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no clinical experience with overdosage of TPOXX .
In case of overdosage , monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of adverse effects .
Hemodialysis will not significantly remove TPOXX in overdosed patients .

Humans achieve greater systemic exposure ( AUC , Cmax , and Cmin ) of tecovirimat following a dose of 600 mg every 12 hours when compared to the therapeutic exposures in these animal models .
Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of tecovirimat were observed based on age , sex , ethnicity , renal impairment ( based on estimated GFR ) , or hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh Scores A , B or C ) .
At the 600 mg twice - daily dosage , tecovirimat exposure was reduced in adult subjects weighing more than 120 kg compared to the exposures in adult subjects weighing less than 120 kg .
Specifically , in 34 adult subjects weighing more than 120 kg who received 600 mg TPOXX orally every 12 hours , the observed mean steady state values of AUC0 - 24 hr , Cmax , and Ctrough were 19500 hr • ng / mL ( CV : 23 % ) , 1300 ng / mL ( CV : 29 % ) , and 585 ng / mL ( CV : 31 % ) , respectively .
Pediatric Patients TPOXX pharmacokinetics has not been evaluated in pediatric patients .
The recommended pediatric dosing regimen is expected to produce tecovirimat exposures that are comparable to those in adult subjects based on a population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation approach [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Hydroxypropyl - β - cyclodextrin , when administered intravenously , is eliminated through glomerular filtration which may be reduced in pediatric patients with renal immaturity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .

Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) Enzymes : Tecovirimat is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP2C19 , and a weak inducer of CYP3A4 .
Tecovirimat is not an inhibitor or an inducer of CYP2B6 or CYP2C9 .
In Vitro Studies Where Drug Interaction Potential Was Not Further Evaluated Clinically CYP Enzymes : Tecovirimat is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 or CYP3A4 , and is not an inducer of CYP1A2 .
Tecovirimat is not a substrate for CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 .
UGT Enzymes : Tecovirimat is a substrate of UGT1A1 and UGT1A4 .
Transporter Systems : Tecovirimat inhibited Breast Cancer Resistance Protein ( BCRP ) in vitro .
Tecovirimat is not an inhibitor of P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) , organic anion transporting polypeptides 1B1 and 1B3 ( OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 ) , organic anion transporter 1 ( OAT1 ) , OAT3 , and organic cation transporter 2 ( OCT2 ) .
Tecovirimat is not a substrate for P - gp , BCRP , OATP1B1 , and OATP1B3 .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tecovirimat targets and inhibits the activity of the orthopoxvirus VP37 protein ( encoded by and highly conserved in all members of the orthopoxvirus genus ) and blocks its interaction with cellular Rab9 GTPase and TIP47 , which prevents the formation of egress competent enveloped virions necessary for cell to cell and long range dissemination of virus .
Activity in Cell Culture In cell culture assays , the effective concentrations of tecovirimat resulting in a 50 % reduction in virus - induced cytopathic effect ( EC50 ) , were 0 . 016 - 0 . 067 µM , 0 . 014 - 0 . 039 µM , 0 . 015 µM , and 0 . 009 µM , for variola , monkeypox , rabbitpox , and vaccinia viruses , respectively .
Ranges given for variola and monkeypox viruses are reflective of results from multiple strains assayed .
Non - antagonistic antiviral activity of tecovirimat and brincidofovir against orthopoxviruses has been demonstrated in cell culture and animal models .
Resistance There are no known instances of naturally occurring tecovirimat resistant orthopoxviruses , although tecovirimat resistance may develop under drug selection .
Tecovirimat has a relatively low resistance barrier , and certain amino acid substitutions in the target VP37 protein can confer large reductions in tecovirimat antiviral activity .
The possibility of resistance to tecovirimat should be considered in patients who either fail to respond to therapy or who develop recrudescence of disease after an initial period of responsiveness .
Cross Resistance Cross - resistance between tecovirimat and brincidofovir is not expected based on their distinct mechanisms of action .
Where tested , orthopoxvirus isolates resistant to cidofovir ( the active metabolite of brincidofovir ) have not been resistant to tecovirimat .
Likewise , orthopoxvirus isolates resistant to tecovirimat retain their sensitivity to cidofovir .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with tecovirimat .
Tecovirimat was not genotoxic in in vitro or in vivo assays , including a bacterial reverse mutation assay , a mammalian mutagenicity assay in mouse lymphoma L5178Y / TK ± cells , and in an in vivo mouse micronucleus study .
Impairment of Fertility In a fertility and early embryonic development study in mice , no effects of tecovirimat on female fertility were observed at tecovirimat exposures ( AUC ) approximately 24 times higher than human exposure at the RHD .
In male mice , decreased male fertility associated with testicular toxicity ( increased percent abnormal sperm and decreased sperm motility ) was observed at 1 , 000 mg / kg / day ( approximately 24 times the human exposure at the RHD ) .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology In a repeat - dose toxicology study in dogs , convulsions ( tonic and clonic ) were observed in one animal within 6 hours of a single dose of 300 mg / kg ( approximately 4 times higher than the highest observed human exposure at the RHD based on Cmax ) .
Electroencephalography ( EEG ) findings in this animal were consistent with seizure activity during the observed convulsions .
Tremors , which were considered non - adverse , were observed at 100 mg / kg / dose ( similar to the highest observed human exposure at the RHD based on Cmax ) , although no convulsions or EEG findings were observed at this dose .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Overview The effectiveness of TPOXX for treatment of smallpox disease has not been determined in humans because adequate and well - controlled field trials have not been feasible , and inducing smallpox disease in humans to study the drug ’ s efficacy is not ethical .
Therefore , the effectiveness of TPOXX for treatment of smallpox disease was established based on results of adequate and well - controlled animal efficacy studies of non - human primates and rabbits infected with non - variola orthopoxviruses .
Survival rates observed in the animal studies may not be predictive of survival rates in clinical practice .
Study Design Efficacy studies were conducted in cynomolgus macaques infected with monkeypox virus , and New Zealand white ( NZW ) rabbits infected with rabbitpox virus .
The primary efficacy endpoint for these studies was survival .
In non - human primate studies , cynomolgus macaques were lethally challenged intravenously with 5 x 107 plaque - forming units of monkeypox virus ; tecovirimat was administered orally once daily at a dose level of 10 mg / kg for 14 days , starting at Day 4 , 5 or 6 post - challenge .
In rabbit studies , NZW rabbits were lethally challenged intradermally with 1 , 000 plaque - forming units of rabbitpox virus ; tecovirimat was administered orally once daily for 14 days at a dose level of 40 mg / kg , starting at Day 4 post - challenge .
The timing of tecovirimat dosing in these studies was intended to assess efficacy when treatment is initiated after animals have developed clinical signs of disease , specifically dermal pox lesions in cynomolgus macaques , and fever in rabbits .
Clinical signs of disease were evident in some animals at Day 2 - 3 post - challenge but were evident in all animals by Day 4 post - challenge .
Survival was monitored for 3 - 6 times the mean time to death for untreated animals in each model .
Study Results Treatment with tecovirimat for 14 days resulted in statistically significant improvement in survival relative to placebo , except when given to cynomolgus macaques starting at Day 6 post - challenge ( Table 8 ) .
