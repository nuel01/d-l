Most hypersensitivity reactions occurred during infusion and were not serious , but often led to discontinuation or required treatment .
Serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur .
Cases of anaphylaxis have been reported in the postmarketing setting . If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs , consider discontinuing VYEPTI and institute appropriate therapy [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 2 % and 2 % or greater than placebo ) were nasopharyngitis and hypersensitivity ( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Lundbeck at 1 - 800 - 455 - 1141 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
The safety of VYEPTI was evaluated in 2076 patients with migraine who received at least one dose of VYEPTI , representing 1615 patient - years of exposure ; of these , 1524 patients were exposed to 100 mg or 300 mg .
Across all doses , 1872 patients were exposed for at least 6 months and 991 patients were exposed for 12 months .
In the placebo - controlled clinical studies ( Study 1 and Study 2 ) of 1372 patients , 579 patients received at least one dose of VYEPTI 100 mg , 574 patients received at least one dose of VYEPTI 300 mg , and 588 patients received placebo [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Approximately 86 % were female , 89 % were white , and the mean age was 40 . 4 years at study entry .
The most common ( incidence at least 2 % and at least 2 % greater than placebo ) adverse reactions in the clinical trials for the preventive treatment of migraine were nasopharyngitis and hypersensitivity .
Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred during Study 1 and Study 2 .
Table 1 .
Adverse Reactions Occurring with an Incidence of at Least 2 % for VYEPTI and at Least 2 % Greater than Placebo in Studies 1 and 2 Adverse Reactions VYEPTI 100 mg N = 579 % VYEPTI 300 mg N = 574 % Placebo N = 588 % Nasopharyngitis 6 8 6 Hypersensitivity reactions * 1 2 0 * Hypersensitivity reactions includes multiple related adverse event terms , such as hypersensitivity , pruritus , and flushing / hot flush that occurred on the day of dosing .
In Study 1 and Study 2 , 1 . 9 % of patients treated with VYEPTI discontinued treatment because of adverse reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is potential for immunogenicity .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be inﬂuenced by several factors , including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies to eptinezumab - jjmr in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading .
In patients receiving VYEPTI 100 mg or 300 mg every 3 months , the incidence of anti - eptinezumab - jjmr antibody development in Study 1 ( up to 56 weeks ) was 20 . 6 % ( 92 / 447 ) , and 41 . 3 % ( 38 / 92 ) of those patients developed anti - eptinezumab - jjmr neutralizing antibodies .
In Study 2 ( up to 32 weeks ) , the incidence of anti - eptinezumab - jjmr antibody development was 18 . 3 % ( 129 / 706 ) , and 34 . 9 % ( 45 / 129 ) of those patients developed anti - eptinezumab - jjmr neutralizing antibodies .
In an open - label study with 84 weeks of treatment , 18 % ( 23 / 128 ) of patients developed anti - eptinezumab - jjmr antibodies , and 39 % ( 9 / 23 ) of those patients developed anti - eptinezumab - jjmr neutralizing antibodies .
Although the results from both studies showed no clear evidence of an impact from development of anti - eptinezumab - jjmr antibodies , including neutralizing antibodies , on the safety and efficacy profiles of VYEPTI , the available data are too limited to make definitive conclusions .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of VYEPTI .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Immune System Disorders : Anaphylaxis [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : Fatigue 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on developmental risks associated with the use of VYEPTI in pregnant women .
No adverse developmental effects were observed following administration of eptinezumab - jjmr to pregnant animals at doses greater than those used clinically [ see Data ] .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % - 4 % and 15 % - 20 % , respectively .
The estimated rate of major birth defects ( 2 . 2 % - 2 . 9 % ) and miscarriage ( 17 % ) among deliveries to women with migraine are similar to rates reported in women without migraine .
Clinical Considerations Disease - Associated Maternal and / or Embryo / Fetal Risk Published data have suggested that women with migraine may be at increased risk of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension during pregnancy .
Data Animal Data When eptinezumab - jjmr ( 0 , 75 , or 150 mg / kg ) was administered weekly to female rats and rabbits by intravenous injection throughout organogenesis , no adverse effects on embryofetal development were observed .
The higher dose tested ( 150 mg / kg ) is 30 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 300 mg , on a body weight basis ( mg / kg ) .
When eptinezumab - jjmr ( 0 , 75 , or 150 mg / kg ) was administered weekly to female rats throughout pregnancy and lactation , no adverse effects on pre - and postnatal development were observed .
The higher dose tested ( 150 mg / kg ) is 30 times the MRHD , on a mg / kg basis .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of eptinezumab - jjmr in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for VYEPTI and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from VYEPTI or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of VYEPTI did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
11 DESCRIPTION Eptinezumab - jjmr is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 ( IgG1 ) monoclonal antibody specific for calcitonin gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) ligand .
Eptinezumab - jjmr has an approximate molecular weight of 143 kD .
Eptinezumab - jjmr is produced in Pichia pastoris yeast cells by recombinant DNA technology .
VYEPTI ( eptinezumab - jjmr ) injection is a sterile , preservative - free , clear to slightly opalescent , colorless to brownish - yellow solution , for intravenous infusion .
VYEPTI is supplied as a 100 mg / mL single - dose vial .
Each mL contains 100 mg eptinezumab - jjmr formulated in L - histidine ( 1 mg ) , L - histidine hydrochloride monohydrate ( 2 . 8 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 0 . 15 mg ) , sorbitol ( 40 . 5 mg ) , and Water for Injection , USP , at a pH of 5 . 8 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Eptinezumab - jjmr is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to calcitonin gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) ligand and blocks its binding to the receptor .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The relationship between the pharmacodynamic activity and the mechanism ( s ) by which eptinezumab - jjmr exerts its clinical effects is unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Eptinezumab - jjmr exhibits linear pharmacokinetics and exposure increases proportionally with doses from 100 mg to 300 mg after intravenous administration .
Steady - state plasma concentration is attained after the first dose with a once every 3 - month dosing schedule .
Distribution The central volume of distribution ( Vc ) for eptinezumab - jjmr is approximately 3 . 7 liters .
Metabolism & Elimination Eptinezumab - jjmr is expected to be degraded by proteolytic enzymes into small peptides and amino acids .
The apparent clearance of eptinezumab - jjmr was 0 . 006 L / h , and the terminal elimination half - life was approximately 27 days .
Specific Populations A population pharmacokinetic analysis assessing the effects of age , race , sex , and body weight did not suggest any clinically significant impact of these covariates on eptinezumab exposures .
Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment No dedicated studies were conducted to assess the effects of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of eptinezumab - jjmr .
However , hepatic or renal impairment is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of eptinezumab - jjmr .
A population pharmacokinetic analysis of integrated data from eptinezumab - jjmr clinical studies did not reveal clinically significant impact on pharmacokinetics of patients with hepatic or renal impairment .
Drug Interaction Studies P450 Enzymes Eptinezumab - jjmr is not metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes ; therefore , interactions with concomitant medications that are substrates , inducers , or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely .
Sumatriptan The co - administration of a single dose of 300 mg eptinezumab - jjmr administered as an intravenous infusion ( over a period of 1 hour ± 15 min ) with a single dose of 6 mg sumatriptan administered subcutaneously did not significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of eptinezumab - jjmr or sumatriptan .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis The carcinogenic potential of eptinezumab - jjmr has not been assessed .
Mutagenesis Genetic toxicology studies of eptinezumab - jjmr have not been conducted .
Impairment of Fertility When eptinezumab - jjmr ( 0 , 75 , or 150 mg / kg ) was administered weekly by intravenous injection to male and female rats prior to and during mating and continuing in females to gestation day 3 - 4 , no adverse effects on fertility were observed .
The higher dose tested ( 150 mg / kg ) is 30 times the maximum recommended human dose of 300 mg , on a body weight basis ( mg / kg ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of VYEPTI was evaluated as a preventive treatment of episodic and chronic migraine in two randomized , multicenter , placebo - controlled studies , both with 6 - month double - blind periods : one study in patients with episodic migraine ( Study 1 ) and one study in patients with chronic migraine ( Study 2 ) .
VYEPTI was administered by intravenous infusion every 3 months in both studies ; however , the primary endpoint was measured at 12 weeks .
Study 1 : Episodic Migraine Study 1 ( NCT02559895 ) included adults with a history of episodic migraine ( 4 to 14 headache days per month , of which at least 4 were migraine days ) .
A total of 665 patients were randomized to receive placebo ( N = 222 ) , 100 mg VYEPTI ( N = 221 ) , or 300 mg VYEPTI ( N = 222 ) every 3 months for 12 months .
Patients were allowed to use concurrent acute migraine or headache medications , including migraine - specific medications ( i . e . , triptans , ergotamine derivatives ) , during the trial .
The study excluded patients with a history of cardiovascular disease ( hypertension , ischemic heart disease ) , neurological disease , or cerebrovascular disease .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in mean monthly migraine days over Months 1 - 3 .
