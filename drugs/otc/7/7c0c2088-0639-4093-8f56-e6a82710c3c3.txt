In adults , sudden death , stroke , and myocardial infarction have been reported .
Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities , cardiomyopathy , serious heart arrhythmias , or coronary artery disease .
( 5 . 2 ) • Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases : Monitor blood pressure and pulse .
Consider the benefits and risks in patients for whom an increase in blood pressure or heart rate would be problematic .
( 5 . 3 ) • Psychiatric Adverse Reactions : Use of stimulants may cause psychotic or manic symptoms in patients with no prior history , or exacerbation of symptoms in patients with pre - existing psychiatric illness .
Evaluate for bipolar disorder prior to methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release use .
( 5 . 4 ) • Priapism : Cases of painful and prolonged penile erections and priapism have been reported with methylphenidate products .
Immediate medical attention should be sought if signs or symptoms of prolonged penile erections or priapism are observed .
( 5 . 5 ) • Peripheral Vasculopathy , including Raynaud ’ s Phenomenon : Stimulants used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy , including Raynaud ’ s phenomenon .
Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants .
( 5 . 6 ) • Long - Term Suppression of Growth : Monitor height and weight at appropriate intervals in pediatric patients .
( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Potential for Abuse and Dependence CNS stimulants , including methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release capsules , other methylphenidate - containing products , and amphetamines , have a high potential for abuse and dependence .
Assess the risk of abuse prior to prescribing and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy [ see Boxed Warning and Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 . 2 , 9 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 2 Serious Cardiovascular Events Sudden death , stroke and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults with CNS stimulant treatment at recommended doses .
Sudden death has been reported in pediatric patients with structural cardiac abnormalities and other serious heart problems taking CNS stimulants at recommended doses for ADHD .
Avoid use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities , cardiomyopathy , serious heart arrhythmia , coronary artery disease , and other serious heart problems .
Further evaluate patients who develop exertional chest pain , unexplained syncope , or arrhythmias during methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release capsule treatment .
5 . 3 Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Increases CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure ( mean increase approximately 2 to 4 mmHg ) and heart rate ( mean increase approximately 3 to 6 bpm ) .
Individuals may have larger increases .
Monitor all patients for hypertension and tachycardia .
5 . 4 Psychiatric Adverse Reactions Exacerbation of Pre - Existing Psychosis CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre - existing psychotic disorder .
Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Disorder CNS stimulants may induce a manic or mixed episode in patients .
Prior to initiating treatment , screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode ( e . g . , comorbid or history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide , bipolar disorder , or depression ) .
New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms CNS stimulants , at recommended doses , may cause psychotic or manic symptoms ( e . g . , hallucinations , delusional thinking , or mania ) in patients without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania .
If such symptoms occur , consider discontinuing methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release capsules .
In a pooled analysis of multiple short - term , placebo - controlled studies of CNS stimulants , psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in approximately 0 . 1 % of CNS stimulant - treated patients , compared to 0 in placebo - treated patients .
5 . 5 Priapism Prolonged and painful erections , sometimes requiring surgical intervention , have been reported with methylphenidate products , in both pediatric and adult patients .
Priapism was not reported with drug initiation but developed after some time on the drug , often subsequent to an increase in dose .
Priapism has also appeared during a period of drug withdrawal ( drug holidays or during discontinuation ) .
Patients who develop abnormally sustained or frequent and painful erections should seek immediate medical attention .
5 . 6 Peripheral Vasculopathy , including Raynaud ’ s Phenomenon CNS stimulants , including methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release capsules , used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy , including Raynaud ’ s phenomenon .
Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild ; however , very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and / or soft tissue breakdown .
Effects of peripheral vasculopathy , including Raynaud ’ s phenomenon , were observed in post - marketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment .
Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of drug .
Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during treatment with ADHD stimulants .
Further clinical evaluation ( e . g . , rheumatology referral ) may be appropriate for certain patients .
5 . 7 Long - Term Suppression of Growth CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients .
Careful follow - up of weight and height in pediatric patients ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non - medication treatment groups over 14 months , as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate - treated and non - medication treated pediatric patients over 36 months ( to the ages of 10 to 13 years ) , suggests that consistently medicated pediatric patients ( i . e . , treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year ) have a temporary slowing in growth rate ( on average , a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2 . 7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years ) , without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development .
Closely monitor growth ( weight and height ) in pediatric patients treated with CNS stimulants , including methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release capsules .
Patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted .

Two methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release clinical studies evaluated a total of 256 patients with ADHD .
Two hundred and forty - three ( 243 ) patients participated in the double - blind phase of these two clinical studies .
Study 1 was a randomized , double - blind , single center , placebo - controlled , flexible - dose , cross - over study to evaluate the time of onset , duration of efficacy , tolerability and safety of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release 15 mg , 20 mg , 30 mg , or 40 mg administered for one week in 26 pediatric patients aged 6 to 12 years who met DSM - IV criteria for ADHD [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Most Common Adverse Reactions ( incidence of ≥ 5 % and at a rate at least twice placebo ) : abdominal pain , pyrexia and headache .
Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation : No subjects discontinued due to adverse reactions during the double - blind phase of this study .
Study 2 was a randomized , double - blind , multicenter , placebo - controlled , parallel group , fixed - dose study of 10 mg , 15 mg , 20 mg , and 40 mg of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release administered for one week in 221 pediatric patients ( 6 to 17 years of age ) who met DSM - IV criteria for ADHD [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Most Common Adverse Reactions ( incidence of ≥ 5 % and at a rate of at least twice placebo ) : abdominal pain , decreased appetite , headache and insomnia .
Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation : Two patients ( 4 . 4 % ) in the methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release 40 mg group discontinued due to insomnia , nausea and rapid heart rate , respectively during the double - blind phase of the study .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
These adverse reactions are as follows : Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : Pancytopenia , Thrombocytopenia , Thrombocytopenic purpura Cardiac Disorders : Angina pectoris , Bradycardia , Extrasystole , Supraventricular tachycardia , Ventricular extrasystole Eye Disorders : Diplopia , Mydriasis , Visual impairment General Disorders : Chest pain , Chest discomfort , Hyperpyrexia Immune System Disorders : Hypersensitivity reactions such as Angioedema , Anaphylactic reactions , Auricular swelling , Bullous conditions , Exfoliative conditions , Urticarias , Pruritus NEC , Rashes , Eruptions , and Exanthemas NEC Investigations : Alkaline phosphatase increased , Bilirubin increased , Hepatic enzyme increased , Platelet count decreased , White blood cell count abnormal , severe hepatic injury Musculoskeletal , Connective Tissue and Bone Disorders : Arthralgia , Myalgia , Muscle twitching , Rhabdomyolysis Nervous System : Convulsion , Grand mal convulsion , Dyskinesia , serotonin syndrome in combination with serotonergic drugs Psychiatric Disorders : Disorientation , Libido changes Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Alopecia , Erythema 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Antihypertensive drugs : Monitor blood pressure .
Adjust dosage of antihypertensive drug as needed ( 7 ) 7 . 1 Clinically Important Interactions with Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Extended - Release Capsules Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors ( MAOIs ) Do not administer methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release capsules concomitantly or within 14 days after discontinuing MAOI treatment .
Concomitant use of MAOIs and CNS stimulants can cause hypertensive crisis .
Potential outcomes include death , stroke , myocardial infarction , aortic dissection , ophthalmological complications , eclampsia , pulmonary edema , and renal failure [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Antihypertensive Drugs Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release capsules may decrease the effectiveness of drugs used to treat hypertension .
Monitor blood pressure and adjust the dosage of the antihypertensive drug as needed [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Risperidone Combined use of methylphenidate with risperidone when there is a change , whether an increase or decrease , in dosage of either or both medications , may increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms ( EPS ) .
Monitor for signs of EPS .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychostimulants at 1 - 866 - 961 - 2388 .
Risk Summary Limited published studies report on the use of methylphenidate in pregnant women ; however , the data are insufficient to inform any drug - associated risks .
No effects on morphological development were observed in embryo - fetal development studies with oral administration of methylphenidate to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 10 and 15 times , respectively , the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 60 mg / day given to adolescents on a mg / m2 basis .
However , spina bifida was observed in rabbits at a dose 52 times the MRHD given to adolescents .
A decrease in pup body weight was observed in a pre - and post - natal development study with oral administration of methylphenidate to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at the highest dose of 60 mg / kg / day ( 6 times the MRHD given to adolescents ) [ see Data ] .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown .
However , the background risk in the U . S . general population of major birth defects is 2 % to 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 % to 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
Clinical Considerations Fetal / Neonatal adverse reactions CNS stimulants , such as methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release , can cause vasoconstriction and thereby decrease placental perfusion .
No fetal and / or neonatal adverse reactions have been reported with the use of therapeutic doses of methylphenidate during pregnancy ; however , premature delivery and low birth weight infants have been reported in amphetamine - dependent mothers .
Data Animal Data In embryo - fetal development studies conducted in rats and rabbits , methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 75 and 200 mg / kg / day , respectively , during the period of organogenesis .
Malformations ( increased incidence of fetal spina bifida ) were observed in rabbits at the highest dose , which is approximately 52 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 60 mg / day given to adolescents on a mg / m2 basis .
The no effect level for embryo - fetal development in rabbits was 60 mg / kg / day ( 15 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg / m2 basis ) .
There was no evidence of morphological development effects in rats , although increased incidences of fetal skeletal variations were seen at the highest dose level ( 10 times the MRHD of 60 mg / day given to adolescents on a mg / m2 basis ) , which was also maternally toxic .
The no effect level for embryo - fetal development in rats was 25 mg / kg / day ( 2 times the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis ) .
When methylphenidate was administered to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses of up to 45 mg / kg / day , offspring body weight gain was decreased at the highest dose ( 6 times the MRHD of 60 mg / day given to adolescents on a mg / m2 basis ) , but no other effects on postnatal development were observed .
The no effect level for pre - and postnatal development in rats was 15 mg / kg / day ( 1 . 5 times the MRHD given to adolescents on a mg / m2 basis ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published literature , based on breast milk sampling from five mothers , reports that methylphenidate is present in human milk , which resulted in infant doses of 0 . 16 % to 0 . 7 % of the maternal weight - adjusted dosage and a milk / plasma ratio ranging between 1 . 1 and 2 . 7 .
There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed infant and no effects on milk production .
However , long - term neurodevelopmental effects on infants from stimulant exposure are unknown .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions , such as agitation , anorexia , and reduced weight gain .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release in pediatric patients under 6 years have not been established .
Safety and efficacy of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release were evaluated in a multicenter , placebo - controlled , double - blind , parallel group study in 119 children 4 to < 6 years of age with ADHD followed by a 12 - month open - label extension in 44 of these children .
In these studies , patients experienced high rates of adverse reactions , most notably weight loss .
Comparing weights prior to initiation of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release ( in the safety and efficacy study ) to weights after 12 months of treatment ( in the open - label extension ) , 20 of 39 patients with data ( 50 % ) had lost enough weight to decrease 10 or more percentiles on a Centers for Disease Control growth chart for weight .
In addition , systemic drug exposures in patients 4 to < 6 years of age were higher than those observed in older children and adolescents at the same dose ( 2 to 3 fold higher Cmax and AUC ) .
Therefore , the benefits of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release do not outweigh the risks in pediatric patients 4 to < 6 years of age .
The safety and effectiveness of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release have been established in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years in two adequate and well - controlled clinical trials [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The long - term efficacy of methylphenidate in pediatric patients has not been established .
Long Term Suppression of Growth Growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants , including methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release .
Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Rats treated with methylphenidate early in the postnatal period through sexual maturation demonstrated a decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity in adulthood .
A deficit in acquisition of a specific learning task was observed in females only .
The doses at which these findings were observed are at least 6 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 60 mg / day given to children on a mg / m2 basis .
In the study conducted in young rats , methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 100 mg / kg / day for 9 weeks , starting early in the postnatal period ( postnatal day 7 ) and continuing through sexual maturity ( postnatal week 10 ) .
When these animals were tested as adults ( postnatal weeks 13 to 14 ) , decreased spontaneous locomotor activity was observed in males and females previously treated with 50 mg / kg / day ( approximately 6 times the MRHD of 60 mg / day given to children on a mg / m2 basis ) or greater , and a deficit in the acquisition of a specific learning task was observed in females exposed to the highest dose ( 8 times the MRHD given to children on a mg / m2 basis ) .
The no effect level for juvenile neurobehavioral development in rats was 5 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 5 times the MRHD given to children on a mg / m2 basis ) .
The clinical significance of the long - term behavioral effects observed in rats is unknown .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release did not include any patients aged 65 years and over .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient start at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9 . 1 Controlled Substance Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release capsules contain methylphenidate a Schedule II controlled substance .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Methylphenidate HCl is a central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant .
The mode of therapeutic action in ADHD is not known .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Methylphenidate is a racemic mixture comprised of the d - and l - isomers .
The d - isomer is more pharmacologically active than the l - isomer .
Methylphenidate blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release in adults , plasma methylphenidate concentrations increase rapidly , reaching an initial maximum at about 2 hours , followed by gradual descending concentrations over the next 4 to 6 hours , after which a gradual increase begins , reaching a second peak at approximately 8 hours ( Figure 1 ) .
The relative bioavailability of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release given once daily as compared to a methylphenidate immediate - release oral product given three times daily in adults is comparable .
The relative bioavailability is 102 % .
The pharmacokinetic profiles and parameters of methylphenidate are similar when methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release is administered either as a whole capsule or sprinkled onto applesauce in subjects under fasting conditions ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) .

The metabolite has little or no pharmacologic activity .
After oral dosing of radiolabeled methylphenidate in humans , about 90 % of the radioactivity was recovered in urine .
The main urinary metabolite was PPAA , accounting for approximately 80 % of the dose .
Food Effects Administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release with high fat meal showed a decreased or diminished second peak .
A high - fat meal also increased the average Cmax of methylphenidate by about 28 % and the AUC by about 19 % .
In the clinical trials of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release , it was administered without regard to meals .
Alcohol Effect At an alcohol concentration up to 40 % , there was 96 % release of methylphenidate from methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release 80 mg capsule within two hours .
The results with the 80 mg capsule are considered to be representative of the other available capsules strengths .
Studies in Specific Populations Gender There is insufficient experience with the use of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release to detect gender variations in pharmacokinetics .
Race There is insufficient experience with the use of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release to detect ethnic variations in pharmacokinetics .
Age The pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate after methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release administration was studied in pediatric patients with ADHD between 6 and 12 years of age .
Following administration of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release , the bi - phasic plasma methylphenidate concentration profile was qualitatively similar in healthy adult volunteers and pediatric patients with ADHD .
The bi - phasic profile in both groups is characterized by an early peak due to rapid absorption of the immediate - release component followed by a delayed , secondary peak due to the controlled - release component of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release .
Renal Insufficiency There is no experience with the use of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release in patients with renal insufficiency .
After oral administration of radiolabeled methylphenidate in humans , methylphenidate was extensively metabolized and approximately 80 % of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine in the form of ritalinic acid metabolite .
Since renal clearance is not an important route of methylphenidate clearance , renal insufficiency is expected to have little effect on the pharmacokinetics of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release .
Hepatic Insufficiency There is no experience with the use of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release in patients with hepatic insufficiency .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis In a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in B6C3F1 mice , methylphenidate caused an increase in hepatocellular adenomas and , in males only , an increase in hepatoblastomas , at a daily dose of approximately 60 mg / kg / day .
This dose is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 60 mg / day given to children on a mg / m2 basis .
Hepatoblastoma is a relatively rare rodent malignant tumor type .
There was no increase in total malignant hepatic tumors .
The mouse strain used is sensitive to the development of hepatic tumors , and the significance of these results to humans is unknown .
Methylphenidate did not cause any increase in tumors in a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in F344 rats ; the highest dose used was approximately 45 mg / kg / day , which is approximately 4 times the MRHD ( children ) on a mg / m2 basis .
Mutagenesis Methylphenidate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Ames reverse mutation assay or in the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay .
Sister chromatid exchanges and chromosome aberrations were increased , indicative of a weak clastogenic response , in an in vitro assay in cultured Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cells .
Methylphenidate was negative in vivo in males and females in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay .
Impairment of Fertility Methylphenidate did not impair fertility in male or female mice that were fed diets containing the drug in an 18 - week Continuous Breeding study .
The study was conducted at doses of up to 160 mg / kg / day , approximately 10 times the maximum recommended human dose of 60 mg / day given to adolescents on a mg / m2 basis .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release for the treatment of ADHD was established in a randomized , double - blind , single center , placebo - controlled , flexible - dose , cross - over trial in pediatric patients aged 6 to 12 years and a second randomized , double - blind , multicenter , placebo - controlled , fixed – dose trial in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years .
Pediatric Patients A randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , flexible - dose , cross - over , analog classroom study ( Study 1 ) was conducted in pediatric patients ages 6 to 12 years ( N = 26 ) who met DSM - IV - TR criteria for ADHD inattentive , hyperactive - impulsive or combined inattentive / hyperactive - impulsive subtypes .
Following a 2 to 4 week open - label dose optimization phase in which patients received flexible - dose methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release capsules 15 mg , 20 mg , 30 mg , or 40 mg administered once daily in the morning , patients were randomly assigned to methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release capsules ( dose from open - label phase ) or placebo .
After 1 - week of treatment , patients were evaluated over a period of 12 hours .
Subsequently , patients were given the opposite treatment for 1 - week and returned for the second evaluation .
Patients could then enter an open - label extension phase for up to 21 months .
Efficacy assessments were conducted at 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . 5 , 6 , 7 . 5 , 9 , 10 . 5 and 12 hours post - dose using the Swanson , Kotkin , Agler , M . Flynn , and Pelham Total score ( SKAMP ) .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the average SKAMP Total Score , comparing methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release capsules to placebo .
SKAMP is a validated 13 - item teacher - rated scale that assesses manifestations of ADHD in a classroom setting .
The SKAMP Total Scores were statistically significantly better ( lower ) for methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release capsules than for placebo at the test day average and at all time points ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . 5 , 6 , 7 . 5 , 9 , 10 . 5 and 12 hours ) post - dosing ( see Figure 2 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] A randomized , double - blind , multicenter , placebo - controlled , parallel - group , fixed - dose study ( Study 2 ) was conducted in pediatric patients age 6 to 17 years ( N = 230 ) who met DSM - IV - TR criteria for ADHD inattentive , hyperactive - impulsive or combined inattentive / hyperactive - impulsive subtypes .
The ADHD - RS - IV is an 18 - item questionnaire with a score range of 0 to 54 points that measures the core symptoms of ADHD and includes both hyperactive / impulsive and inattentive subscales .
Patients were randomized to a daily morning dose of methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release capsules 10 mg , 15 mg , 20 mg , or 40 mg , or placebo for 1 week .
An 11 - week open label phase followed the double - blind phase .
Patients could then enter another open - label phase for up to 21 months .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean decrease from baseline to the end of Week 1 in the ADHD - RS - IV Total Score .
Each of the four methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release capsule doses ( 10 mg , 15 mg , 20 mg , and 40 mg / day ) was compared to placebo at the end of week 1 .
For both the 20 mg / day and the 40 mg / day doses , methylphenidate hydrochloride extended - release was superior to placebo in reduction of the ADHD - RS - IV Total Score , but not for the 10 mg / day or the 15 mg / day doses .
A total of 221 patients completed the 1 - week double - blind phase .
Among those , 200 ( 90 . 5 % ) completed the 11 - week open label phase and 173 ( 86 . 5 % ) patients continued into the 21 - month open - label extension phase .
