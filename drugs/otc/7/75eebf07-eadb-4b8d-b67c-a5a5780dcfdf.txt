1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of XIFAXAN and other antibacterial drugs , XIFAXAN when used to treat infection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria .
When culture and susceptibility information are available , they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy .
In the absence of such data , local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy .
XIFAXAN is a rifamycin antibacterial indicated for : • The treatment of patients ( ≥ 12 years of age ) with travelers ’ diarrhea ( TD ) caused by noninvasive strains of Escherichia coli ( 1 . 1 ) • Reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) recurrence in patients ≥ 18 years of age ( 1 . 2 ) Limitations of Use • TD : Do not use in patients with diarrhea complicated by fever or blood in the stool or diarrhea due to pathogens other than Escherichia coli ( 1 . 1 ) 1 . 1 Travelers ’ Diarrhea XIFAXAN 200 mg is indicated for the treatment of patients ( ≥ 12 years of age ) with travelers ’ diarrhea caused by noninvasive strains of Escherichia coli [ see Warningsand Precautions ( 5 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) and ClinicalStudies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
Limitations of Use XIFAXAN should not be used in patients with diarrhea complicated by fever or blood in the stool or diarrhea due to pathogens other than Escherichia coli .
1 . 2 Hepatic Encephalopathy XIFAXAN 550 mg is indicated for reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) recurrence in patients ≥ 18 years of age .
In the trials of XIFAXAN for HE , 91 % of the patients were using lactulose concomitantly .
Differences in the treatment effect of those patients not using lactulose concomitantly could not be assessed .
XIFAXAN has not been studied in patients with MELD ( Model for End - Stage Liver Disease ) scores > 25 , and only 8 . 6 % of patients in the controlled trial had MELD scores over 19 .
There is increased systemic exposure in patients with more severe hepatic dysfunction [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Travelers ’ diarrhea : One 200 mg tablet taken orally three times a day for 3 days , with or without food ( 2 . 1 ) • Hepatic encephalopathy : One 550 mg tablet taken orally two times a day , with or without food ( 2 . 2 ) 2 . 1 Dosage for Travelers ’ Diarrhea The recommended dose of XIFAXAN is one 200 mg tablet taken orally three times a day for 3 days .
XIFAXAN can be administered orally , with or without food [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 2 Dosage for Hepatic Encephalopathy The recommended dose of XIFAXAN is one 550 mg tablet taken orally two times a day , with or without food [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS XIFAXAN is a pink - colored biconvex tablet and is available in the following strengths : • 200 mg – a round tablet debossed with “ Sx ” on one side .
• 550 mg – an oval tablet debossed with “ rfx ” on one side .
• 200 mg and 550 mg tablets ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS History of hypersensitivity to rifaximin , rifamycin antimicrobial agents , or any of the components of XIFAXAN ( 4 . 1 ) 4 . 1 Hypersensitivity XIFAXAN is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to rifaximin , any of the rifamycin antimicrobial agents , or any of the components in XIFAXAN .
Hypersensitivity reactions have included exfoliative dermatitis , angioneurotic edema , and anaphylaxis [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Travelers ’ Diarrhea Not Caused by E . coli : XIFAXAN was not effective in diarrhea complicated by fever and / or blood in the stool or diarrhea due to pathogens other than E . coli .
If diarrhea symptoms get worse or persist for more than 24 - 48 hours , discontinue XIFAXAN and consider alternative antibiotics ( 5 . 1 ) • Clostridium difficile - Associated Diarrhea : Evaluate if diarrhea occurs after therapy or does not improve or worsens during therapy ( 5 . 2 ) • Hepatic Impairment : Use with caution in patients with severe ( Child - Pugh C ) hepatic impairment ( 5 . 4 , 8 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Travelers ’ Diarrhea Not Caused by Escherichia coli XIFAXAN was not found to be effective in patients with diarrhea complicated by fever and / or blood in the stool or diarrhea due to pathogens other than Escherichia coli .
Discontinue XIFAXAN if diarrhea symptoms get worse or persist more than 24 - 48 hours and alternative antibiotic therapy should be considered .
XIFAXAN is not effective in cases of travelers ’ diarrhea due to Campylobacter jejuni .
The effectiveness of XIFAXAN in travelers ’ diarrhea caused by Shigella spp .
and Salmonella spp .
has not been proven .
XIFAXAN should not be used in patients where Campylobacter jejuni , Shigella spp . , or Salmonella spp .
may be suspected as causative pathogens .
5 . 2 Clostridium difficile - Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including XIFAXAN , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon which may lead to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibiotic treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
5 . 3 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria Prescribing XIFAXAN for travelers ’ diarrhea in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria .
5 . 4 Severe ( Child - Pugh C ) Hepatic Impairment There is increased systemic exposure in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
Animal toxicity studies did not achieve systemic exposures that were seen in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
The clinical trials were limited to patients with MELD scores < 25 .
Therefore , caution should be exercised when administering XIFAXAN to patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 2 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS • Most common adverse reactions in travelers ’ diarrhea ( ≥ 5 % ) : Flatulence , headache , abdominal pain , rectal tenesmus , defecation urgency and nausea ( 6 . 1 ) • Most common adverse reactions in HE ( ≥ 10 % ) : Peripheral edema , nausea , dizziness , fatigue , ascites , flatulence , and headache ( 6 . 1 ) To report suspected adverse reactions , contact Salix Pharmaceuticals at 1 - 800 - 508 - 0024 and www . Salix . com or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch 6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Travelers ’ Diarrhea The safety of XIFAXAN 200 mg taken three times a day was evaluated in patients with travelers ’ diarrhea consisting of 320 patients in two placebo - controlled clinical trials with 95 % of patients receiving three or four days of treatment with XIFAXAN .
The population studied had a mean age of 31 . 3 ( 18 - 79 ) years of which approximately 3 % were ≥ 65 years old , 53 % were male and 84 % were White , 11 % were Hispanic .
Discontinuations due to adverse reactions occurred in 0 . 4 % of patients .
The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were taste loss , dysentery , weight decrease , anorexia , nausea and nasal passage irritation .
All adverse reactions for XIFAXAN 200 mg three times daily that occurred at a frequency ≥ 2 % in the two placebo - controlled trials combined are provided in Table 1 .
( These include adverse reactions that may be attributable to the underlying disease . )

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , estimates of frequency cannot be made .
These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness , frequency of reporting or causal connection to XIFAXAN .
Infections and Infestations Cases of C . difficile - associated colitis have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
General Hypersensitivity reactions , including exfoliative dermatitis , rash , angioneurotic edema ( swelling of face and tongue and difficulty swallowing ) , urticaria , flushing , pruritus and anaphylaxis have been reported .
These events occurred as early as within 15 minutes of drug administration .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro studies have shown that rifaximin did not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A2 , 2A6 , 2B6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 2E1 and CYP3A4 at concentrations ranging from 2 to 200 ng / mL [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Rifaximin is not expected to inhibit these enzymes in clinical use .
An in vitro study has suggested that rifaximin induces CYP3A4 [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
However , in patients with normal liver function , rifaximin at the recommended dosing regimen is not expected to induce CYP3A4 .
It is unknown whether rifaximin can have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of concomitant CYP3A4 substrates in patients with reduced liver function who have elevated rifaximin concentrations .
An in vitro study suggested that rifaximin is a substrate of P - glycoprotein .
It is unknown whether concomitant drugs that inhibit P - glycoprotein can increase the systemic exposure of rifaximin [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Based on animal data , may cause fetal harm ( 8 . 1 ) • Nursing Mothers : Discontinue nursing or drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother ( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women .
Rifaximin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses that caused maternal toxicity .
XIFAXAN tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Administration of rifaximin to pregnant rats and rabbits at dose levels that caused reduced body weight gain resulted in eye malformations in both rat and rabbit fetuses .
Additional malformations were observed in fetal rabbits that included cleft palate , lumbar scoliosis , brachygnathia , interventricular septal defect , and large atrium .
The fetal rat malformations were observed in a study of pregnant rats administered a high dose that resulted in 16 times the therapeutic dose to diarrheic patients or 1 times the therapeutic dose to patients with hepatic encephalopathy ( based upon plasma AUC comparisons ) .
Fetal rabbit malformations were observed from pregnant rabbits administered mid and high doses that resulted in 1 or 2 times the therapeutic dose to diarrheic patients or less than 0 . 1 times the dose in patients with hepatic encephalopathy , based upon plasma AUC comparisons .
Post - natal developmental effects were not observed in rat pups from pregnant / lactating female rats dosed during the period from gestation to Day 20 post - partum at the highest dose which resulted in approximately 16 times the human therapeutic dose for travelers ’ diarrhea ( based upon AUCs ) or approximately 1 times the AUCs derived from therapeutic doses to patients with hepatic encephalopathy .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether rifaximin is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from XIFAXAN , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of XIFAXAN 200 mg in pediatric patients with travelers ’ diarrhea less than 12 years of age have not been established .
The safety and effectiveness of XIFAXAN 550 mg for HE have not been established in patients < 18 years of age .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies with rifaximin 200 mg for travelers ’ diarrhea did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects .
In the controlled trial with XIFAXAN 550 mg for hepatic encephalopathy , 19 . 4 % were 65 and over , while 2 . 3 % were 75 and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of rifaximin in patients with impaired renal function has not been studied .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Following administration of XIFAXAN 550 mg twice daily to patients with a history of hepatic encephalopathy , the systemic exposure ( i . e . , AUCτ ) of rifaximin was about 10 - , 13 - , and 20 - fold higher in those patients with mild ( Child - Pugh A ) , moderate ( Child - Pugh B ) and severe ( Child - Pugh C ) hepatic impairment , respectively , compared to that in healthy volunteers .
No dosage adjustment is recommended because rifaximin is presumably acting locally .
Nonetheless , caution should be exercised when XIFAXAN is administered to patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 2 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with XIFAXAN .
In clinical studies at doses higher than the recommended dose ( > 600 mg / day for travelers ’ diarrhea or > 1100 mg / day for hepatic encephalopathy ) , adverse reactions were similar in subjects who received doses higher than the recommended dose and placebo .
In the case of overdosage , discontinue XIFAXAN , treat symptomatically , and institute supportive measures as required .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Rifaximin is an antibacterial drug [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Travelers ’ Diarrhea Systemic absorption of rifaximin ( 200 mg three times daily ) was evaluated in 13 subjects challenged with shigellosis on Days 1 and 3 of a three - day course of treatment .
Rifaximin plasma concentrations and exposures were low and variable .
There was no evidence of accumulation of rifaximin following repeated administration for 3 days ( 9 doses ) .
Peak plasma rifaximin concentrations after 3 and 9 consecutive doses ranged from 0 . 81 to 3 . 4 ng / mL on Day 1 and 0 . 68 to 2 . 26 ng / mL on Day 3 .
Similarly , AUC0 - last estimates were 6 . 95 ± 5 . 15 ng • h / mL on Day 1 and 7 . 83 ± 4 . 94 ng • h / mL on Day 3 .
XIFAXAN is not suitable for treating systemic bacterial infections because of limited systemic exposure after oral administration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Hepatic Encephalopathy After a single dose and multiple doses of rifaximin 550 mg in healthy subjects , the mean time to reach peak plasma concentrations was about an hour .
The pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameters were highly variable and the accumulation ratio based on AUC was 1 . 37 .
The PK of rifaximin in patients with a history of HE was evaluated after administration of XIFAXAN , 550 mg two times a day .
The PK parameters were associated with a high variability and mean rifaximin exposure ( AUCτ ) in patients with a history of HE ( 147 ng • h / mL ) was approximately 12 - fold higher than that observed in healthy subjects following the same dosing regimen ( 12 . 3 ng • h / mL ) .
When PK parameters were analyzed based on Child - Pugh Class A , B , and C , the mean AUCτ was 10 - , 13 - , and 20 - fold higher , respectively , compared to that in healthy subjects ( Table 3 ) .

Distribution Rifaximin is moderately bound to human plasma proteins .
In vivo , the mean protein binding ratio was 67 . 5 % in healthy subjects and 62 % in patients with hepatic impairment when XIFAXAN 550 mg was administered .
Metabolism and Excretion In a mass balance study , after administration of 400 mg 14 C - rifaximin orally to healthy volunteers , of the 96 . 94 % total recovery , 96 . 62 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered in feces almost exclusively as the unchanged drug and 0 . 32 % was recovered in urine mostly as metabolites with 0 . 03 % as the unchanged drug .
Rifaximin accounted for 18 % of radioactivity in plasma .
This suggests that the absorbed rifaximin undergoes metabolism with minimal renal excretion of the unchanged drug .
The enzymes responsible for metabolizing rifaximin are unknown .
In a separate study , rifaximin was detected in the bile after cholecystectomy in patients with intact gastrointestinal mucosa , suggesting biliary excretion of rifaximin .
Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment The systemic exposure of rifaximin was markedly elevated in patients with hepatic impairment compared to healthy subjects .
The mean AUC in patients with Child - Pugh Class C hepatic impairment was 2 - fold higher than in patients with Child - Pugh Class A hepatic impairment ( see Table 3 ) , [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of rifaximin in patients with impaired renal function has not been studied .
Drug Interactions In vitro drug interaction studies have shown that rifaximin , at concentrations ranging from 2 to 200 ng / mL , did not inhibit human hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 1A2 , 2A6 , 2B6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 2E1 , and 3A4 .
In an in vitro study , rifaximin was shown to induce CYP3A4 at the concentration of 0 . 2 µM .
An in vitro study suggests that rifaximin is a substrate of P - glycoprotein .
In the presence of P - glycoprotein inhibitor verapamil , the efflux ratio of rifaximin was reduced greater than 50 % in vitro .
The effect of P - glycoprotein inhibition on rifaximin was not evaluated in vivo .
The inhibitory effect of rifaximin on P - gp transporter was observed in an in vitro study .
The effect of rifaximin on P - gp transporter was not evaluated in vivo .
Midazolam The effect of rifaximin 200 mg administered orally every 8 hours for 3 days and for 7 days on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of either midazolam 2 mg intravenous or midazolam 6 mg orally was evaluated in healthy subjects .
No significant difference was observed in the metrics of systemic exposure or elimination of intravenous or oral midazolam or its major metabolite , 1 ’ - hydroxymidazolam , between midazolam alone or together with rifaximin .
Therefore , rifaximin was not shown to significantly affect intestinal or hepatic CYP3A4 activity for the 200 mg three times a day dosing regimen .
After XIFAXAN 550 mg was administered three times a day for 7 days and 14 days to healthy subjects , the mean AUC of single midazolam 2 mg orally was 3 . 8 % and 8 . 8 % lower , respectively , than when midazolam was administered alone .
The mean Cmax of midazolam was also decreased by 4 - 5 % when XIFAXAN was administered for 7 - 14 days prior to midazolam administration .
This degree of interaction is not considered clinically meaningful .
The effect of rifaximin on CYP3A4 in patients with impaired liver function who have elevated systemic exposure is not known .
Oral Contraceptives Containing 0 . 07 mg Ethinyl Estradiol and 0 . 5 mg Norgestimate The oral contraceptive study utilized an open - label , crossover design in 28 healthy female subjects to determine if rifaximin 200 mg orally administered three times a day for 3 days ( the dosing regimen for travelers ’ diarrhea ) altered the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of an oral contraceptive containing 0 . 07 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0 . 5 mg norgestimate .
Results showed that the pharmacokinetics of single doses of ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate were not altered by rifaximin [ seeDrug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Effect of rifaximin on oral contraceptives was not studied for XIFAXAN 550 mg twice a day , the dosing regimen for hepatic encephalopathy .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Rifaximin is a non - aminoglycoside semi - synthetic antibacterial derived from rifamycin SV .
Rifaximin acts by binding to the beta - subunit of bacterial DNA - dependent RNA polymerase resulting in inhibition of bacterial RNA synthesis .
Escherichia coli has been shown to develop resistance to rifaximin in vitro .
However , the clinical significance of such an effect has not been studied .
Rifaximin is a structural analog of rifampin .
Organisms with high rifaximin minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) values also have elevated MIC values against rifampin .
Cross - resistance between rifaximin and other classes of antimicrobials has not been studied .
Rifaximin has been shown to be active against the following pathogen in clinical studies of infectious diarrhea as described in the Indications and Usage ( 1 ) section : Escherichia coli ( enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative strains ) .
For HE , rifaximin is thought to have an effect on the gastrointestinal flora .
Susceptibility Tests In vitro susceptibility testing was performed according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards ( NCCLS ) agar dilution method M7 - A6 [ see References ( 15 ) ] .
However , the correlation between susceptibility testing and clinical outcome has not been determined .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Malignant schwannomas in the heart were significantly increased in male Crl : CD ® ( SD ) rats that received rifaximin by oral gavage for two years at 150 to 250 mg / kg / day ( doses equivalent to 2 . 4 to 4 times the recommended dose of 200 mg three times daily for travelers ’ diarrhea , and equivalent to 1 . 3 to 2 . 2 times the recommended dose of 550 mg twice daily for hepatic encephalopathy , based on relative body surface area comparisons ) .
There was no increase in tumors in Tg . rasH2 mice dosed orally with rifaximin for 26 weeks at 150 to 2000 mg / kg / day ( doses equivalent to 1 . 2 to 16 times the recommended daily dose for travelers ’ diarrhea and equivalent to 0 . 7 to 9 times the recommended daily dose for hepatic encephalopathy , based on relative body surface area comparisons ) .
Rifaximin was not genotoxic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay , chromosomal aberration assay , rat bone marrow micronucleus assay , rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis assay , or the CHO / HGPRT mutation assay .
There was no effect on fertility in male or female rats following the administration of rifaximin at doses up to 300 mg / kg ( approximately 5 times the clinical dose of 600 mg / day , and approximately 2 . 6 times the clinical dose of 1100 mg / day , adjusted for body surface area ) .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Oral administration of rifaximin for 3 - 6 months produced hepatic proliferation of connective tissue in rats ( 50 mg / kg / day ) and fatty degeneration of liver in dogs ( 100 mg / kg / day ) .
However , plasma drug levels were not measured in these studies .
Subsequently , rifaximin was studied at doses as high as 300 mg / kg / day in rats for 6 months and 1000 mg / kg / day in dogs for 9 months , and no signs of hepatotoxicity were observed .
The maximum plasma AUC 0 - 8 hr values from the 6 month rat and 9 month dog toxicity studies ( range : 42 - 127 ng • h / mL ) was lower than the maximum plasma AUC 0 - 8 hr values in cirrhotic patients ( range : 19 - 306 ng • h / mL ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Travelers ’ Diarrhea The efficacy of XIFAXAN given as 200 mg orally taken three times a day for 3 days was evaluated in 2 randomized , multi ‑ center , double - blind , placebo - controlled studies in adult subjects with travelers ’ diarrhea .
One study was conducted at clinical sites in Mexico , Guatemala , and Kenya ( Study 1 ) .
The other study was conducted in Mexico , Guatemala , Peru , and India ( Study 2 ) .
Stool specimens were collected before treatment and 1 to 3 days following the end of treatment to identify enteric pathogens .
The predominant pathogen in both studies was Escherichia coli .
The clinical efficacy of XIFAXAN was assessed by the time to return to normal , formed stools and resolution of symptoms .
The primary efficacy endpoint was time to last unformed stool ( TLUS ) which was defined as the time to the last unformed stool passed , after which clinical cure was declared .
Table 5 displays the median TLUS and the number of patients who achieved clinical cure for the intent to treat ( ITT ) population of Study 1 .
The duration of diarrhea was significantly shorter in patients treated with XIFAXAN than in the placebo group .
More patients treated with XIFAXAN were classified as clinical cures than were those in the placebo group .
Table 5 .
Clinical Response in Study 1 ( ITT population ) XIFAXAN ( n = 125 ) Placebo ( n = 129 ) Estimate ( 97 . 5 % CI ) P - Value a Hazard Ratio b Difference in rates Median TLUS ( hours ) 32 . 5 58 . 6 1 . 78 a ( 1 . 26 , 2 . 50 ) 0 . 0002 Clinical cure , n ( % ) 99 ( 79 . 2 ) 78 ( 60 . 5 ) 18 . 7 b ( 5 . 3 , 32 . 1 ) 0 . 001 Microbiological eradication ( defined as the absence of a baseline pathogen in culture of stool after 72 hours of therapy ) rates for Study 1 are presented in Table 6 for patients with any pathogen at baseline and for the subset of patients with Escherichia coli at baseline .
Escherichia coli was the only pathogen with sufficient numbers to allow comparisons between treatment groups .
Even though XIFAXAN had microbiologic activity similar to placebo , it demonstrated a clinically significant reduction in duration of diarrhea and a higher clinical cure rate than placebo .
Therefore , patients should be managed based on clinical response to therapy rather than microbiologic response .
Table 6 .
Microbiologic Eradication Rates in Study 1 Subjects with a Baseline Pathogen XIFAXAN Placebo Overall 48 / 70 ( 68 . 6 ) 41 / 61 ( 67 . 2 ) E . coli 38 / 53 ( 71 . 7 ) 40 / 54 ( 74 . 1 ) The results of Study 2 supported the results presented for Study 1 .
In addition , this study provided evidence that subjects treated with XIFAXAN with fever and / or blood in the stool at baseline had prolonged TLUS .
These subjects had lower clinical cure rates than those without fever or blood in the stool at baseline .
Many of the patients with fever and / or blood in the stool ( dysentery - like diarrheal syndromes ) had invasive pathogens , primarily Campylobacter jejuni , isolated in the baseline stool .
Also in this study , the majority of the subjects treated with XIFAXAN who had Campylobacter jejuni isolated as a sole pathogen at baseline failed treatment and the resulting clinical cure rate for these patients was 23 . 5 % ( 4 / 17 ) .
In addition to not being different from placebo , the microbiologic eradication rates for subjects with Campylobacter jejuni isolated at baseline were much lower than the eradication rates seen for Escherichia coli .
In an unrelated open - label , pharmacokinetic study of oral XIFAXAN 200 mg taken every 8 hours for 3 days , 15 adult subjects were challenged with Shigella flexneri 2 a , of whom 13 developed diarrhea or dysentery and were treated with XIFAXAN .
Although this open - label challenge trial was not adequate to assess the effectiveness of XIFAXAN in the treatment of shigellosis , the following observations were noted : eight subjects received rescue treatment with ciprofloxacin either because of lack of response to XIFAXAN treatment within 24 hours ( 2 ) , or because they developed severe dysentery ( 5 ) , or because of recurrence of Shigella flexneri in the stool ( 1 ) ; five of the 13 subjects received ciprofloxacin although they did not have evidence of severe disease or relapse .
14 . 2 Hepatic Encephalopathy The efficacy of XIFAXAN 550 mg taken orally two times a day was evaluated in a randomized , placebo - controlled , double - blind , multi - center 6 - month trial of adult subjects from the U . S . , Canada and Russia who were defined as being in remission ( Conn score of 0 or 1 ) from hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) .
Eligible subjects had ≥ 2 episodes of HE associated with chronic liver disease in the previous 6 months .
A total of 299 subjects were randomized to receive either XIFAXAN ( n = 140 ) or placebo ( n = 159 ) in this study .
Patients had a mean age of 56 years ( range , 21 - 82 years ) , 81 % < 65 years of age , 61 % were male and 86 % White .
At baseline , 67 % of patients had a Conn score of 0 and 68 % had an asterixis grade of 0 .
Patients had MELD scores of either ≤ 10 ( 27 % ) or 11 to 18 ( 64 % ) at baseline .
No patients were enrolled with a MELD score of > 25 .
Nine percent of the patients were Child - Pugh Class C . Lactulose was concomitantly used by 91 % of the patients in each treatment arm of the study .
Per the study protocol , patients were withdrawn from the study after experiencing a breakthrough HE episode .
Other reasons for early study discontinuation included : adverse reactions ( XIFAXAN 6 % ; placebo 4 % ) , patient request to withdraw ( XIFAXAN 4 % ; placebo 6 % ) and other ( XIFAXAN 7 % ; placebo 5 % ) .
The primary endpoint was the time to first breakthrough overt HE episode .
A breakthrough overt HE episode was defined as a marked deterioration in neurological function and an increase of Conn score to Grade ≥ 2 .
In patients with a baseline Conn score of 0 , a breakthrough overt HE episode was defined as an increase in Conn score of 1 and asterixis grade of 1 .
Breakthrough overt HE episodes were experienced by 31 of 140 subjects ( 22 % ) in the XIFAXAN group and by 73 of 159 subjects ( 46 % ) in the placebo group during the 6 - month treatment period .
Comparison of Kaplan - Meier estimates of event - free curves showed XIFAXAN significantly reduced the risk of HE breakthrough by 58 % during the 6 - month treatment period .
Presented below in Figure 1 is the Kaplan - Meier event - free curve for all subjects ( n = 299 ) in the study .
Figure 1 : Kaplan - Meier Event - Free Curves1 in HE Study ( Time to First Breakthrough - HE Episode up to 6 Months of Treatment , Day 170 ) ( ITT Population ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] Note : Open diamonds and open triangles represent censored subjects .
1 Event - free refers to non - occurrence of breakthrough HE .
When the results were evaluated by the following demographic and baseline characteristics , the treatment effect of XIFAXAN 550 mg in reducing the risk of breakthrough overt HE recurrence was consistent for : sex , baseline Conn score , duration of current remission and diabetes .
The differences in treatment effect could not be assessed in the following subpopulations due to small sample size : non - White ( n = 42 ) , baseline MELD > 19 ( n = 26 ) , Child - Pugh C ( n = 31 ) , and those without concomitant lactulose use ( n = 26 ) .
HE - related hospitalizations ( hospitalizations directly resulting from HE , or hospitalizations complicated by HE ) were reported for 19 of 140 subjects ( 14 % ) and 36 of 159 subjects ( 23 % ) in the XIFAXAN and placebo groups respectively .
Comparison of Kaplan - Meier estimates of event - free curves showed XIFAXAN significantly reduced the risk of HE - related hospitalizations by 50 % during the 6 - month treatment period .
Comparison of Kaplan - Meier estimates of event - free curves is shown in Figure 2 .

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 17 . 1 Persistent Diarrhea For those patients being treated for travelers ’ diarrhea , discontinue XIFAXAN if diarrhea persists more than 24 - 48 hours or worsens .
Advise the patient to seek medical care for fever and / or blood in the stool [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
17 . 2 Clostridium difficile - Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including XIFAXAN , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibiotics alters the normal flora of the colon which may lead to C . difficile .
Patients can develop watery and bloody stools ( with or without stomach cramps and fever ) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic .
If diarrhea occurs after therapy or does not improve or worsens during therapy , advise patients to contact a physician as soon as possible [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
17 . 3 Administration with Food Inform patients that XIFAXAN may be taken with or without food .
17 . 4 Antibacterial Resistance Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including XIFAXAN should only be used to treat bacterial infections .
They do not treat viral infections ( e . g . , the common cold ) .
When XIFAXAN is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection , patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy , the medication should be taken exactly as directed .
Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may ( 1 ) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and ( 2 ) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by XIFAXAN or other antibacterial drugs in the future .
17 . 5 Severe Hepatic Impairment Patients should be informed that in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) there is an increase in systemic exposure to XIFAXAN [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
