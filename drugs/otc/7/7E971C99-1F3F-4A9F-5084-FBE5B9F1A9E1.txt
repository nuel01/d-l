Neomycin is bactericidal for many gram - positive and gram - negative organisms .
It is an aminoglycoside antibiotic which inhibits protein synthesis by binding with ribosomal RNA and causing misreading of the bacterial genetic code .
Polymyxin B is bactericidal for a variety of gram - negative organisms .
It increases the permeability of the bacterial cell membrane by interacting with the phospholipid components of the membrane .
Bacitracin is bactericidal for a variety of gram - positive and gram - negative organisms .
It interferes with bacterial cell wall synthesis by inhibition of the regeneration of phospholipid receptors involved in peptidoglycan synthesis .
Microbiology : Neomycin sulfate , polymyxin B sulfate , and bacitracin zinc together are considered active against the following microorganisms : Staphylococcus aureus , streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae , Escherichia coli , Haemophilus influenzae , Klebsiella / Enterobacter species , Neisseria species , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
The product does not provide adequate coverage against Serratia marcescens .

If superinfection occurs , appropriate measures should be initiated .
Bacterial resistance to NEOSPORIN Ophthalmic Ointment may also develop .
If purulent discharge , inflammation , or pain become aggravated , the patient should discontinue use of the medication and consult a physician .
There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of topical ophthalmic products in multiple - dose containers which have been inadvertently contaminated by patients , most of whom had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface ( see PRECAUTIONS : Information for Patients ) .
Allergic cross - reactions may occur which could prevent the use of any or all of the following antibiotics for the treatment of future infections : kanamycin , paromomycin , streptomycin , and possibly gentamicin .
Information for Patients Patients should be instructed to avoid allowing the tip of the dispensing container to contact the eye , eyelid , fingers , or any other surface .
The use of this product by more than one person may spread infection .
Patients should also be instructed that ocular products , if handled improperly , can become contaminated by common bacteria known to cause ocular infections .
Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated products ( see PRECAUTIONS : General ) .
If the condition persists or gets worse , or if a rash or allergic reaction develops , the patient should be advised to stop use and consult a physician .
Do not use this product if you are allergic to any of the listed ingredients .
Keep tightly closed when not in use .
Keep out of reach of children .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential have not been conducted with polymyxin B sulfate or bacitracin .
Treatment of cultured human lymphocytes in vitrowith neomycin increased the frequency of chromosome aberrations at the highest concentration ( 80 µg / mL ) tested ; however , the effects of neomycin on carcinogenesis and mutagenesis in humans are unknown .
Polymyxin B has been reported to impair the motility of equine sperm , but its effects on male or female fertility are unknown .
No adverse effects on male or female fertility , litter size or survival were observed in rabbits given bacitracin zinc 100 gm / ton of diet .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with neomycin sulfate , polymyxin B sulfate , or bacitracin , It is also not known whether NEOSPORIN Ophthalmic Ointment can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
