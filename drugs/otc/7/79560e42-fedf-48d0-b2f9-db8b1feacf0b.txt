3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Adriamycin ( DOXOrubicin HCl ) for Injection , USP : Vials contain 10 mg and 50 mg doxorubicin hydrochloride as a red - orange lyophilized powder .
• Adriamycin ( DOXOrubicin HCl ) for Injection , USP : Vials contain 10 mg and 50 mg as a lyophilized powder ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Doxorubicin is contraindicated in patients with : • Severe myocardial insufficiency [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Recent ( occurring within the past 4 to 6 weeks ) myocardial infarction [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Severe persistent drug - induced myelosuppression [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] Severe hepatic impairment ( defined as Child Pugh Class C or serum bilirubin level greater than 5 mg / dL ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Severe hypersensitivity reaction to doxorubicin including anaphylaxis [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] • • Severe myocardial insufficiency ( 4 ) • • Recent myocardial infarction ( 4 ) • • Severe persistent drug - induced myelosuppression ( 4 ) • • Severe hepatic impairment ( 4 ) • • Hypersensitivity to doxorubicin HCl ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Radiation - induced toxicity can be increased by the administration of doxorubicin .
Radiation recall can occur in patients who receive doxorubicin after prior radiation therapy ( 5 . 7 ) .
• Embryofetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm .
Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus ( 5 . 8 ) .
5 . 1 Cardiomyopathy and Arrhythmias Cardiomyopathy Doxorubicin can result in myocardial damage , including acute left ventricular failure .
The risk of cardiomyopathy is generally proportional to the cumulative exposure .
Include prior doses of other anthracyclines or anthracenediones in calculations of total cumulative dosage for doxorubicin .
Cardiomyopathy may develop during treatment or up to several years after completion of treatment and can include decrease in LVEF and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure ( CHF ) .
The probability of developing cardiomyopathy is estimated to be 1 to 2 % at a total cumulative dose of 300 mg / m2 of doxorubicin , 3 to 5 % at a dose of 400 mg / m2 , 5 to 8 % at a dose of 450 mg / m2 , and 6 to 20 % at a dose of 500 mg / m2 , when doxorubicin is administered every 3 weeks .
There is an additive or potentially synergistic increase in the risk of cardiomyopathy in patients who have received radiotherapy to the mediastinum or concomitant therapy with other known cardiotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide and trastuzumab .
Pericarditis and myocarditis have also been reported during or following doxorubicin treatment .
Assess left ventricular cardiac function ( e . g . , MUGA or echocardiogram ) prior to initiation of doxorubicin , during treatment to detect acute changes , and after treatment to detect delayed cardiotoxicity .
Increase the frequency of assessments as the cumulative dose exceeds 300 mg / m2 .
Use the same method of assessment of LVEF at all time points [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Consider the use of dexrazoxane to reduce the incidence and severity of cardiomyopathy due to doxorubicin administration in patients who have received a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg / m2 and who will continue to receive doxorubicin .
Arrhythmias Doxorubicin can result in arrhythmias , including life - threatening arrhythmias , during or within a few hours after doxorubicin administration and at any time point during treatment .
Tachyarrhythmias , including sinus tachycardia , premature ventricular contractions , and ventricular tachycardia , as well as bradycardia may occur .
Electrocardiographic changes including non - specific ST - T wave changes , atrioventricular and bundle - branch block can also occur .
These electrocardiographic changes may be transient and self - limited and may not require dose - modifications of doxorubicin .
5 . 2 Secondary Malignancies The risk of developing secondary acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) and myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) is increased following treatment with doxorubicin .
Cumulative incidences ranged from 0 . 2 % at five years to 1 . 5 % at 10 years in two separate trials involving the adjuvant treatment of women with breast cancer .
These leukemias generally occur within 1 to 3 years of treatment .
5 . 3 Extravasation and Tissue Necrosis Extravasation of doxorubicin can result in severe local tissue injury manifesting as blistering , ulceration , and necrosis requiring wide excision of the affected area and skin grafting .
When given via a peripheral venous line , infuse doxorubicin over 10 minutes or less to minimize the risk of thrombosis or perivenous extravasation .
If signs or symptoms of extravasation occur , immediately terminate the injection or infusion [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Extravasation may be present in patients who do not experience a stinging or burning sensation or when blood return is present on aspiration of the infusion needle .
If extravasation is suspected , apply ice to the site intermittently for 15 minutes , 4 times a day for 3 days .
If appropriate , administer dexrazoxane at the site of extravasation as soon as possible and within the first 6 hours after extravasation .
5 . 4 Severe Myelosuppression Doxorubicin can cause myelosuppression .
In Study 1 , the incidence of severe myelosuppression was : grade 4 leukopenia ( 0 . 3 % ) , grade 3 leukopenia ( 3 % ) , and grade 4 thrombocytopenia ( 0 . 1 % ) .
A dose - dependent , reversible neutropenia is the predominant manifestation of hematologic toxicity from doxorubicin .
When doxorubicin is administered every 21 days , the neutrophil count reaches its nadir 10 to 14 days after administration with recovery usually occurring by the 21 st day .
Obtain baseline assessment of blood counts and carefully monitor patients during treatment for possible clinical complications due to myelosuppression .
5 . 5 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The clearance of doxorubicin is decreased in patients with elevated serum bilirubin with an increased risk of toxicity [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Reduce the dose of doxorubicin in patients with serum bilirubin levels of 1 . 2 to 5 . 0 mg / dL [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Doxorubicin is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( defined as Child Pugh Class C or serum bilirubin level greater than 5 mg / dL ) [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Obtain liver tests including SGOT , SGPT , alkaline phosphatase , and bilirubin prior to and during doxorubicin therapy .
5 . 6 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Doxorubicin may induce tumor lysis syndrome in patients with rapidly growing tumors .
Evaluate blood uric acid levels , potassium , calcium , phosphate , and creatinine after initial treatment .
Hydration , urine alkalinization , and prophylaxis with allopurinol to prevent hyperuricemia may minimize potential complications of tumor lysis syndrome .
5 . 7 Radiation Sensitization and Radiation Recall Doxorubicin can increase radiation - induced toxicity to the myocardium , mucosa , skin , and liver .
Radiation recall , including but not limited to cutaneous and pulmonary toxicity , can occur in patients who receive doxorubicin after prior radiation therapy .
5 . 8 Embryofetal Toxicity Doxorubicin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Doxorubicin was teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats and rabbits at doses lower than the recommended human dose .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment with doxorubicin and for 6 months after treatment .
Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant , or if pregnancy is suspected , while taking doxorubicin [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) and ( 8 . 6 ) ] .

• Do not administer doxorubicin in combination with trastuzumab due to increased risk of cardiac dysfunction ( 5 . 1 , 7 . 2 ) .
7 . 1 Effect of CYP3A4 Inhibitors , Inducers and P - gp Doxorubicin is a major substrate of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 , and P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) .
Clinically significant interactions have been reported with inhibitors of CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 , and / or P - gp ( e . g . , verapamil ) , resulting in increased concentration and clinical effect of doxorubicin .
Inducers of CYP3A4 ( e . g . , phenobarbital , phenytoin , St . John ’ s Wort ) and P - gp inducers may decrease the concentration of doxorubicin .
Avoid concurrent use of doxorubicin with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 , or P - gp .
7 . 2 Trastuzumab Concurrent use of trastuzumab and doxorubicin results in an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction .
Avoid concurrent administration of doxorubicin and trastuzumab .
The appropriate interval for administering doxorubicin following trastuzumab therapy has not been determined [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
7 . 3 Paclitaxel Paclitaxel , when given prior to doxorubicin , increases the plasma - concentrations of doxorubicin and its metabolites .
Administer doxorubicin prior to paclitaxel if used concomitantly .
7 . 4 Dexrazoxane Do not administer dexrazoxane as a cardioprotectant at the initiation of doxorubicin containing chemotherapy regimens .
In a randomized trial in women with metastatic breast cancer , initiation of dexrazoxane with doxorubicin based chemotherapy resulted in a significantly lower tumor response rate ( 48 % vs . 63 % ; p = 0 . 007 ) and shorter time to progression than in women who received doxorubicin based chemotherapy alone .
7 . 5 6 - Mercaptopurine Doxorubicin may potentiate 6 - mercaptopurine - induced hepatotoxicity .
In 11 patients with refractory leukemia treated with 6 - mercaptopurine ( 500 mg / m2 intravenously daily for 5 days per cycle every 2 to 3 weeks ) and doxorubicin ( 50 mg / m2 intravenous once per cycle every 2 to 3 weeks ) alone or with vincristine and prednisone , all developed hepatic dysfunction manifested by elevations of total serum bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Nursing Mothers : Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother ( 8 . 3 ) .
• Pediatric Use : Recommend long - term follow - up cardiac evaluations due to risk of delayed cardiotoxicity ( 8 . 4 ) .
• Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : May impair fertility .
Counsel female and male patients on pregnancy planning and prevention ( 8 . 6 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Risk Summary Doxorubicin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Doxorubicin was teratogenic and embryotoxic in rats and rabbits at doses approximately 0 . 07 times ( based on body surface area ) the recommended human dose of 60 mg / m2 .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus .
Animal Data Doxorubicin was teratogenic and embryotoxic at doses of 0 . 8 mg / kg / day ( about 0 . 07 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) when administered during the period of organogenesis in rats .
Teratogenicity and embryotoxicity were also seen using discrete periods of treatment .
The most susceptible was the 6 - to 9 - day gestation period at doses of 1 . 25 mg / kg / day and greater .
Characteristic malformations included esophageal and intestinal atresia , tracheo - esophageal fistula , hypoplasia of the urinary bladder , and cardiovascular anomalies .
Doxorubicin was embryotoxic ( increase in embryofetal deaths ) and abortifacient at 0 . 4 mg / kg / day ( about 0 . 07 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) in rabbits when administered during the period of organogenesis .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Doxorubicin has been detected in the milk of at least one lactating patient [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from doxorubicin , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Based on postmarketing reports , pediatric patients treated with doxorubicin are at risk for developing late cardiovascular dysfunction .
Risk factors include young age at treatment ( especially < 5 years ) , high cumulative doses and receipt of combined modality therapy .
Long - term periodic cardiovascular monitoring is recommended for all pediatric patients who have received doxorubicin .
Doxorubicin , as a component of intensive chemotherapy regimens administered to pediatric patients , may contribute to prepubertal growth failure and may also contribute to gonadal impairment , which is usually temporary .
There are no recommended dose adjustments based on age .
Doxorubicin clearance was increased in patients aged 2 years to 20 years as compared to adults , while doxorubicin clearance was similar in children less than 2 years as compared to adults [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical experience in patients who were 65 years of age and older who received doxorubicin HCl - based chemotherapy regimens for metastatic breast cancer showed no overall differences in safety and effectiveness compared with younger patients .
8 . 6 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females Doxorubicin can cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy .
Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception during treatment with doxorubicin and for 6 months after treatment .
Advise patients to contact their healthcare provider if they become pregnant , or if pregnancy is suspected , while taking doxorubicin [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Males Doxorubicin may damage spermatozoa and testicular tissue , resulting in possible genetic fetal abnormalities .
Males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during and for 6 months after treatment [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Females In females of reproductive potential , doxorubicin may cause infertility and result in amenorrhea .
Premature menopause can occur .
Recovery of menses and ovulation is related to age at treatment [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Males Doxorubicin may result in oligospermia , azoospermia , and permanent loss of fertility .
Sperm counts have been reported to return to normal levels in some men .
This may occur several years after the end of therapy .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment The clearance of doxorubicin was reduced in patients with elevated serum bilirubin levels .
Reduce the dose of doxorubicin in patients with serum bilirubin levels greater than 1 . 2 mg / dL [ See Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Doxorubicin is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( defined as Child Pugh Class C or serum bilirubin levels greater than 5 mg / dL ) [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Few cases of overdose have been described .
A 58 - year - old man with acute lymphoblastic leukemia received 10 - fold overdose of doxorubicin ( 300 mg / m2 ) in one day .
He was treated with charcoal filtration , hemopoietic growth factor ( G - CSF ) , proton pump inhibitor and antimicrobial prophylaxis .
The patient suffered sinus tachycardia , grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia for 11 days , severe mucositis and sepsis .
The patient recovered completely 26 days after the overdose .
A 17 - year - old girl with osteogenic sarcoma received 150 mg of doxorubicin daily for 2 days ( intended dose was 50 mg per day for 3 days ) .
The patient developed severe mucositis on days 4 - 7 after the overdose and chills and pyrexia on day 7 .
The patient was treated with antibiotics and platelets and recovered 18 days after overdose .
11 DESCRIPTION Doxorubicin is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces peucetius var . caesius .
Doxorubicin consists of a naphthacenequinone nucleus linked through a glycosidic bond at ring atom 7 to an amino sugar , daunosamine .
Chemically , doxorubicin hydrochloride is ( 8 S , 10 S ) - 10 - [ ( 3 - Amino - 2 , 3 , 6 - trideoxy - a - L - lyxo - hexopyranosyl ) - oxy ] - 8 - glycoloyl - 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 - tetrahydro - 6 , 8 , 11 - trihydroxy - 1 - methoxy - 5 , 12 - naphthacenedione hydrochloride .
The structural formula is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Doxorubicin binds to nucleic acids , presumably by specific intercalation of the planar anthracycline nucleus with the DNA double helix .
The anthracycline ring is lipophilic , but the saturated end of the ring system contains abundant hydroxyl groups adjacent to the amino sugar , producing a hydrophilic center .
The molecule is amphoteric , containing acidic functions in the ring phenolic groups and a basic function in the sugar amino group .
It binds to cell membranes as well as plasma proteins .
It is supplied in the hydrochloride form as a sterile red - orange lyophilized powder containing lactose and as a sterile parenteral , isotonic solution with sodium chloride for intravenous use only .
Adriamycin ( DOXOrubicin HCl ) for Injection , USP : Each 10 mg lyophilized vial contains 10 mg of Doxorubicin Hydrochloride , USP and 50 mg of Lactose Monohydrate , NF .
Each 50 mg lyophilized vial contains 50 mg of Doxorubicin Hydrochloride , USP and 250 mg of Lactose Monohydrate , NF .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin on malignant cells and its toxic effects on various organs are thought to be related to nucleotide base intercalation and cell membrane lipid binding activities of doxorubicin .
Intercalation inhibits nucleotide replication and action of DNA and RNA polymerases .
The interaction of doxorubicin with topoisomerase II to form DNA - cleavable complexes appears to be an important mechanism of doxorubicin cytocidal activity .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic studies conducted in patients with various types of tumors have shown that doxorubicin follows multiphasic disposition after intravenous injection .
The distribution half - life is approximately 5 minutes , while the terminal half - life is 20 to 48 hours .
In four patients , doxorubicin demonstrated dose - independent pharmacokinetics across a dose range of 30 to 70 mg / m2 .
Distribution Steady - state distribution volume ranges from 809 to 1214 L / m2 .
Binding of doxorubicin and its major metabolite , doxorubicinol , to plasma proteins is about 75 % and is independent of plasma concentration of doxorubicin up to 1 . 1 mcg / mL .
Doxorubicin was measured in the milk of one lactating patient after therapy with 70 mg / m2 of doxorubicin given as a 15 - minute intravenous infusion .
The peak milk concentration at 24 hours after treatment was 4 . 4 - fold greater than the corresponding plasma concentration .
Doxorubicin was detectable in the milk up to 72 hours .
Doxorubicin does not cross the blood brain barrier .
Metabolism Enzymatic reduction at the 7 position and cleavage of the daunosamine sugar yields aglycones which are accompanied by free radical formation , the local production of which may contribute to the cardiotoxic activity of doxorubicin .
Disposition of doxorubicinol in patients is formation rate limited , with the terminal half - life of doxorubicinol being similar to doxorubicin .
The relative exposure of doxorubicinol , i . e . , the ratio between the AUC of doxorubicinol and the AUC of doxorubicin is approximately 0 . 5 .
Excretion Plasma clearance is in the range 324 to 809 mL / min / m2 and is predominately by metabolism and biliary excretion .
Approximately 40 % of the dose appears in the bile in 5 days , while only 5 to 12 % of the drug and its metabolites appear in the urine during the same time period .
In urine , < 3 % of the dose was recovered as doxorubicinol over 7 days .
Systemic clearance of doxorubicin is significantly reduced in obese women with ideal body weight greater than 130 % .
There was a significant reduction in clearance without any change in volume of distribution in obese patients when compared with normal patients with less than 115 % ideal body weight .
Pediatric patients Following administration of doses ranging from 10 to 75 mg / m2 of doxorubicin to 60 children and adolescents ranging from 2 months to 20 years of age , doxorubicin clearance averaged 1443 ± 114 mL / min / m2 .
Further analysis demonstrated that clearance in 52 children greater than 2 years of age ( 1540 mL / min / m2 ) was increased compared with adults .
However , clearance in infants younger than 2 years of age ( 813 mL / min / m2 ) was decreased compared with older children and approached the range of clearance values determined in adults [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Patient Gender There is no recommended dose adjustment based on gender .
A published clinical study involving 6 men and 21 women with no prior anthracycline therapy reported a significantly higher median doxorubicin clearance in men compared to women ( 1088 mL / min / m2 versus 433 mL / min / m2 ) .
However , the terminal half - life of doxorubicin was longer in men compared to women ( 54 versus 35 hours ) .
Patients with hepatic impairment The clearance of doxorubicin and doxorubicinol was reduced in patients with elevation in serum bilirubin [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Doxorubicin treatment results in an increased risk of secondary malignancies based on postmarketing reports [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Doxorubicin was mutagenic in the in vitro Ames assay , and clastogenic in multiple in vitro assays ( CHO cell , V79 hamster cell , human lymphoblast , and SCE assays ) and the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
Doxorubicin decreased fertility in female rats at the doses of 0 . 05 and 0 . 2 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 005 and 0 . 02 times the recommended human dose , based on body surface area ) A single intravenous dose of 0 . 1 mg / kg doxorubicin ( approximately 0 . 01 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) was toxic to male reproductive organs in animal studies , producing testicular atrophy , diffuse degeneration of the seminiferous tubules , and oligospermia / hypospermia in rats .
Doxorubicin induces DNA damage in rabbit spermatozoa and dominant lethal mutations in mice .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The clinical efficacy of doxorubicin HCl - containing regimens for the post - operative , adjuvant treatment of surgically resected breast cancer was evaluated in a meta - analysis conducted by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group ( EBCTCG ) .
The EBCTCG meta - analyses compared cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , and 5 - fluorouracil ( CMF ) to no chemotherapy ( 19 trials including 7523 patients ) and doxorubicin HCl - containing regimens with CMF as an active control ( 6 trials including 3510 patients ) .
Data from the meta - analysis of trials comparing CMF to no therapy were used to establish the historical treatment effect size for CMF regimens .
The major efficacy outcome measures were disease - free survival ( DFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) .
Of the 3510 women ( 2157 received doxorubicin HCl - containing regimens and 1353 received CMF treatment ) with early breast cancer involving axillary lymph nodes included in the six trials from the meta - analyses , approximately 70 % were premenopausal and 30 % were postmenopausal .
At the time of the meta - analysis , 1745 first recurrences and 1348 deaths had occurred .
The analyses demonstrated that doxorubicin HCl - containing regimens retained at least 75 % of the historical CMF adjuvant effect on DFS with a hazard ratio ( HR ) of 0 . 91 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 8 to 1 . 01 ) and on OS with a HR of 0 . 91 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 8 to 1 . 03 ) .
Results of these analyses for both DFS and OS are provided in Table 2 and Figures 1 and 2 .
