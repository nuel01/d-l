( , ) 1 . 114 Important Limitation of Use : • Not for treatment of type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis .
( ) • 1 . 2 1 . 1 Monotherapy and Combination Therapy Pioglitazone tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus in multiple clinical settings .
[ see ] Clinical Studies ( 14 ) 1 . 2 Important Limitation of Use Pioglitazone tablets exert their antihyperglycemic effect only in the presence of endogenous insulin .
Pioglitazone tablets should not be used to treat type 1 diabetes or diabetic ketoacidosis , as it would not be effective in these settings .
Use caution in patients with liver disease [ see ] .
Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Initiate pioglitazone tablets at 15 mg or 30 mg once daily .
Limit initial dose to 15 mg once daily in patients with NYHA Class I or II heart failure .
( ) • 2 . 1 • If there is inadequate glycemic control , the dose can be increased in 15 mg increments up to a maximum of 45 mg once daily .
( ) • 2 . 1 • The maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone tablets is 15 mg once daily in patients taking strong CYP2C8 inhibitors ( e . g . , gemfibrozil ) .
( , ) • 2 . 37 . 1 • Obtain liver tests before starting pioglitazone tablets .
If abnormal , use caution when treating with pioglitazone tablets , investigate the probable cause , treat ( if possible ) and follow appropriately .
Monitoring liver tests while on pioglitazone tablets is not recommended in patients without liver disease .
( ) • 5 . 3 2 . 1 Recommendations for All Patients Pioglitazone tablets should be taken once daily and can be taken without regard to meals .
The recommended starting dose for patients without congestive heart failure is 15 mg or 30 mg once daily .
The recommended starting dose for patients with congestive heart failure ( NYHA Class I or II ) is 15 mg once daily .
The dose can be titrated in increments of 15 mg up to a maximum of 45 mg once daily based on glycemic response as determined by HbA1c .
After initiation of pioglitazone tablets or with dose increase , monitor patients carefully for adverse reactions related to fluid retention such as weight gain , edema , and signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure .
[ see and ] Boxed WarningWarnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) Liver tests ( serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases , alkaline phosphatase , and total bilirubin ) should be obtained prior to initiating pioglitazone tablets .
Routine periodic monitoring of liver tests during treatment with pioglitazone tablets is not recommended in patients without liver disease .
Patients who have liver test abnormalities prior to initiation of pioglitazone tablets or who are found to have abnormal liver tests while taking pioglitazone tablets should be managed as described under Warnings and Precautions .
[ see and ] Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) 2 . 2 Concomitant Use with an Insulin Secretagogue or Insulin If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient coadministered pioglitazone tablets and an insulin secretagogue ( e . g . , sulfonylurea ) , the dose of the insulin secretagogue should be reduced .
If hypoglycemia occurs in a patient coadministered pioglitazone tablets and insulin , the dose of insulin should be decreased by 10 % to 25 % .
Further adjustments to the insulin dose should be individualized based on glycemic response .
2 . 3 Coadministration with Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors Coadministration of pioglitazone tablets and gemfibrozil , a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor , increases pioglitazone exposure approximately 3 - fold .
Therefore , the maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone tablets is 15 mg daily when used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors [ see and ] .

• Do not initiate pioglitazone tablets in patients with established NYHA Class III or IV heart failure .
( ) • 4 • Do not use in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to pioglitazone tablets or its ingredients .
( ) • 4 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Congestive heart failure : Fluid retention may occur and can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure .
Combination use with insulin and use in congestive heart failure NYHA Class I and II may increase risk .
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms .
( ) • 5 . 1 • Edema : Dose - related edema may occur .
( ) • 5 . 2 • Hepatic effects : Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure , sometimes fatal .
Causality cannot be excluded .
If liver injury is detected , promptly interrupt pioglitazone tablets and assess patient for probable cause , then treat cause if possible , to resolution or stabilization .
Do not restart pioglitazone tablets if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found .
( ) • 5 . 3 • Fractures : Increased incidence in female patients .
Apply current standards of care for assessing and maintaining bone health .
( ) • 5 . 4 • Bladder cancer : Preclinical and clinical trial data , and results from an observational study suggest an increased risk of bladder cancer in pioglitazone users .
The observational data further suggest that the risk increases with duration of use .
Do not use in patients with active bladder cancer .
Use caution when using in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer .
( ) • 5 . 5 • Hypoglycemia : When used with insulin or an insulin secretagogue , a lower dose of the insulin or insulin secretagogue may be needed to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia .
( ) • 5 . 6 • Macular edema : Postmarketing reports .
Recommend regular eye exams in all patients with diabetes according to current standards of care with prompt evaluation for acute visual changes .
( ) • 5 . 7 • Macrovascular outcomes : There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone tablets or any other antidiabetic drug .
( ) • 5 . 9 5 . 1 Congestive Heart Failure Pioglitazone tablets , like other thiazolidinediones , can cause dose - related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone tablets are used in combination with insulin .
Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure .
Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure .
If congestive heart failure develops , it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of pioglitazone tablets must be considered , .
[ see , Boxed WarningContraindications ( 4 ) and ] Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) 5 . 2 Edema In controlled clinical trials , edema was reported more frequently in patients treated with pioglitazone tablets than in placebo - treated patients and is dose - related .
In postmarketing experience , reports of new onset or worsening edema have been received .
[ see ] Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) Pioglitazone tablets should be used with caution in patients with edema .
Because thiazolidinediones , including pioglitazone tablets , can cause fluid retention , which can exacerbate or lead to congestive heart failure , pioglitazone tablets should be used with caution in patients at risk for congestive heart failure .
Patients treated with pioglitazone tablets should be monitored for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure , .
[ see Boxed Warningand ] Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) Patient Counseling Information ( 17 . 1 ) 5 . 3 Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and non - fatal hepatic failure in patients taking pioglitazone tablets , although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause .
There has been no evidence of drug - induced hepatotoxicity in the pioglitazone tablets controlled clinical trial database to date .
[ see ] Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) Patients with type 2 diabetes may have fatty liver disease or cardiac disease with episodic congestive heart failure , both of which may cause liver test abnormalities , and they may also have other forms of liver disease , many of which can be treated or managed .
Therefore , obtaining a liver test panel ( serum alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] , aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ] , alkaline phosphatase , and total bilirubin ) and assessing the patient is recommended before initiating pioglitazone tablets therapy .
In patients with abnormal liver tests , pioglitazone tablets should be initiated with caution .
Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury , including fatigue , anorexia , right upper abdominal discomfort , dark urine or jaundice .
In this clinical context , if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests ( ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of the reference range ) , pioglitazone tablets treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause .
Pioglitazone tablets should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities .
Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug - induced liver injury , and should not be restarted on pioglitazone tablets .
For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause , treatment with pioglitazone tablets can be used with caution .
5 . 4 Fractures In PROactive ( the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events ) , 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone tablets ( N = 2605 ) , force - titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo ( N = 2633 ) in addition to standard of care .
During a mean follow - up of 34 . 5 months , the incidence of bone fracture in females was 5 . 1 % ( 44 / 870 ) for pioglitazone tablets versus 2 . 5 % ( 23 / 905 ) for placebo .
This difference was noted after the first year of treatment and persisted during the course of the study .
The majority of fractures observed in female patients were nonvertebral fractures including lower limb and distal upper limb .
No increase in the incidence of fracture was observed in men treated with pioglitazone tablets ( 1 . 7 % ) versus placebo ( 2 . 1 % ) .
The risk of fracture should be considered in the care of patients , especially female patients , treated with pioglitazone tablets and attention should be given to assessing and maintaining bone health according to current standards of care .
5 . 5 Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two - year carcinogenicity study [ seeNonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
In two 3 - year trials in whichpioglitazonetablets were compared to placebo orglyburide , there were 16 / 3656 ( 0 . 44 % ) reports of bladder cancer in patients takingpioglitazonetablets compared to 5 / 3679 ( 0 . 14 % ) in patients not takingpioglitazonetablets .
After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer , there were six ( 0 . 16 % ) cases onpioglitazonetablets and two ( 0 . 05 % ) cases on placebo .
A five - year interim report of an ongoing 10 - year observational cohort study found a non - significant increase in the risk for bladder cancer in subjects ever exposed topioglitazonetablets , compared to subjects never exposed topioglitazonetablets ( HR 1 . 2 [ 95 % CI 0 . 9 – 1 . 5 ] ) .
Compared to never exposure , a duration ofpioglitazonetablets therapy longer than 12 months was associated with an increase in risk ( HR 1 . 4 [ 95 % CI 0 . 9 – 2 . 1 ] ) , which reached statistical significance after more than 24 months ofpioglitazonetablets use ( HR 1 . 4 [ 95 % CI 1 . 03 – 2 . 0 ] ) .
Interim results from this study suggested that takingpioglitazonetablets longer than 12 months increased the relative risk of developing bladder cancer in any given year by 40 % which equates to an absolute increase of three cases in 10 , 000 ( from approximately seven in 10 , 000 [ withoutpioglitazonetablets ] to approximately 10 in 10 , 000 [ withpioglitazonetablets ] ) .
There are insufficient data to determine whetherpioglitazoneis a tumor promoter for urinary bladder tumors .
Consequently , pioglitazonetablets should not be used in patients with active bladder cancer and the benefits ofglycemiccontrol versus unknown risks for cancer recurrence withpioglitazonetablets should be considered in patients with a prior history of bladder cancer .
5 . 6 Hypoglycemia Patients receiving pioglitazone tablets in combination with insulin or other anti - diabetic medications ( particularly insulin secretagogues such as sulfonylureas ) may be at risk for hypoglycemia .
A reduction in the dose of the concomitant antidiabetic medication may be necessary to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [ see ] .
Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) 5 . 7 Macular Edema Macular edema has been reported in postmarketing experience in diabetic patients who were taking pioglitazone tablets or another thiazolidinedione .
Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity , but others were diagnosed on routine ophthalmologic examination .
Most patients had peripheral edema at the time macular edema was diagnosed .
Some patients had improvement in their macular edema after discontinuation of the thiazolidinedione .
Patients with diabetes should have regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist according to current standards of care .
Patients with diabetes who report any visual symptoms should be promptly referred to an ophthalmologist , regardless of the patient ' s underlying medications or other physical findings .
[ see ] Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) 5 . 8 Ovulation Therapy with pioglitazone tablets , like other thiazolidinediones , may result in ovulation in some premenopausal anovulatory women .
As a result , these patients may be at an increased risk for pregnancy while taking pioglitazone tablets .
This effect has not been investigated in clinical trials , so the frequency of this occurrence is not known .
Adequate contraception in all premenopausal women treated with pioglitazone tablets is recommended .
[ see ] Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) 5 . 9 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with pioglitazone tablets or any other antidiabetic drug .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling : • Congestive heart failure • [ see and ] Boxed WarningWarnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) • Edema • [ see ] Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) • Fractures • [ see ] Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) Most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 5 % and at a rate higher than with placebo ) include upper respiratory tract infection , headache , sinusitis , myalgia , and pharyngitis .

6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Over 8500 patients with type 2 diabetes have been treated with pioglitazone tablets in randomized , double - blind , controlled clinical trials , including 2605 patients with type 2 diabetes and macrovascular disease treated with pioglitazone tablets in the PROactive clinical trial .
In these trials , over 6000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone tablets for six months or longer , over 4500 patients have been treated with pioglitazone tablets for one year or longer , and over 3000 patients have been treated with pioglitazone tablets for at least two years .
In six pooled 16 - to 26 - week placebo - controlled monotherapy and 16 - to 24 - week add - on combination therapy trials , the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 4 . 5 % for patients treated with pioglitazone tablets and 5 . 8 % for comparator - treated patients .
The most common adverse events leading to withdrawal were related to inadequate glycemic control , although the incidence of these events was lower ( 1 . 5 % ) with pioglitazone tablets than with placebo ( 3 . 0 % ) .
In the PROactive trial , the incidence of withdrawals due to adverse events was 9 . 0 % for patients treated with pioglitazone tablets and 7 . 7 % for placebo - treated patients .
Congestive heart failure was the most common serious adverse event leading to withdrawal occurring in 1 . 3 % of patients treated with pioglitazone tablets and 0 . 6 % of patients treated with placebo .

Almost all patients ( 95 % ) were receiving cardiovascular medications ( beta blockers , ACE inhibitors , angiotensin II receptor blockers , calcium channel blockers , nitrates , diuretics , aspirin , statins and fibrates ) .
At baseline , patients had a mean age of 62 years , mean duration of diabetes of 9 . 5 years , and mean HbA1c of 8 . 1 % .
Mean duration of follow - up was 34 . 5 months .
The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone tablets on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events .
The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all - cause mortality , nonfatal myocardial infarction ( MI ) including silent MI , stroke , acute coronary syndrome , cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention , major leg amputation above the ankle , and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg .
A total of 514 ( 19 . 7 % ) patients treated with pioglitazone tablets and 572 ( 21 . 7 % ) placebo - treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint ( hazard ratio 0 . 90 ; 95 % Confidence Interval : 0 . 80 , 1 . 02 ; p = 0 . 10 ) .
Although there was no statistically significant difference between pioglitazone tablets and placebo for the three - year incidence of a first event within this composite , there was no increase in mortality or in total macrovascular events with pioglitazone tablets .
The number of first occurrences and total individual events contributing to the primary composite endpoint is shown in Table 9 .

Edema Edema induced from taking pioglitazone tablets is reversible when pioglitazone tablets are discontinued .
The edema usually does not require hospitalization unless there is coexisting congestive heart failure .
A summary of the frequency and types of edema adverse events occurring in clinical investigations of pioglitazone tablets is provided in Table 12 .

Hepatic Effects There has been no evidence of induced hepatotoxicity with pioglitazone tablets in the pioglitazone tablets controlled clinical trial database to date .
One randomized , double - blind 3 - year trial comparing pioglitazone tablets to glyburide as add - on to metformin and insulin therapy was specifically designed to evaluate the incidence of serum ALT elevation to greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range , measured every eight weeks for the first 48 weeks of the trial then every 12 weeks thereafter .
A total of 3 / 1051 ( 0 . 3 % ) patients treated with pioglitazone tablets and 9 / 1046 ( 0 . 9 % ) patients treated with glyburide developed ALT values greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range .
None of the patients treated with pioglitazone tablets in the pioglitazone tablets controlled clinical trial database to date have had a serum ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range and a corresponding total bilirubin greater than two times the upper limit of the reference range , a combination predictive of the potential for severe drug - induced liver injury .
Hypoglycemia In the pioglitazone tablets clinical trials , adverse events of hypoglycemia were reported based on clinical judgment of the investigators and did not require confirmation with fingerstick glucose testing .
In the 16 - week add - on to sulfonylurea trial , the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 3 . 7 % with pioglitazone tablets 30 mg and 0 . 5 % with placebo .
In the 16 - week add - on to insulin trial , the incidence of reported hypoglycemia was 7 . 9 % with pioglitazone tablets 15 mg , 15 . 4 % with pioglitazone tablets 30 mg , and 4 . 8 % with placebo .
The incidence of reported hypoglycemia was higher with pioglitazone tablets 45 mg compared to pioglitazone tablets 30 mg in both the 24 - week add - on to sulfonylurea trial ( 15 . 7 % vs . 13 . 4 % ) and in the 24 - week add - on to insulin trial ( 47 . 8 % vs . 43 . 5 % ) .
Three patients in these four trials were hospitalized due to hypoglycemia .
All three patients were receiving pioglitazone tablets 30 mg ( 0 . 9 % ) in the 24 - week add - on to insulin trial .
An additional 14 patients reported severe hypoglycemia ( defined as causing considerable interference with patient ' s usual activities ) that did not require hospitalization .
These patients were receiving pioglitazone tablets 45 mg in combination with sulfonylurea ( n = 2 ) or pioglitazone tablets 30 mg or 45 mg in combination with insulin ( n = 12 ) .
Urinary Bladder Tumors Tumors were observed in the urinary bladder of male rats in the two - year carcinogenicity study .
In two 3 - year trials in which pioglitazone tablets was compared to placebo or glyburide , there were 16 / 3656 ( 0 . 44 % ) reports of bladder cancer in patients taking pioglitazone tablets compared to 5 / 3679 ( 0 . 14 % ) in patients not taking pioglitazone tablets .
After excluding patients in whom exposure to study drug was less than one year at the time of diagnosis of bladder cancer , there were six ( 0 . 16 % ) cases on pioglitazone tablets and two ( 0 . 05 % ) cases on placebo .
There are too few events of bladder cancer to establish causality .
[ see ] Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) 6 . 2 Laboratory Abnormalities Hematologic Effects Pioglitazone tablets may cause decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit .
In placebo - controlled monotherapy trials , mean hemoglobin values declined by 2 % to 4 % in patients treated with pioglitazone tablets compared with a mean change in hemoglobin of - 1 % to + 1 % in placebo - treated patients .
These changes primarily occurred within the first 4 to 12 weeks of therapy and remained relatively constant thereafter .
These changes may be related to increased plasma volume associated with pioglitazone tablets therapy and are not likely to be associated with any clinically significant hematologic effects .
CreatinePhosphokinase During protocol - specified measurement of serum creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) in pioglitazone tablets clinical trials , an isolated elevation in CPK to greater than 10 times the upper limit of the reference range was noted in nine ( 0 . 2 % ) patients treated with pioglitazone tablets ( values of 2150 to 11400 IU / L ) and in no comparator - treated patients .
Six of these nine patients continued to receive pioglitazone tablets , two patients were noted to have the CPK elevation on the last day of dosing and one patient discontinued pioglitazone tablets due to the elevation .
These elevations resolved without any apparent clinical sequelae .
The relationship of these events to pioglitazone tablets therapy is unknown .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of pioglitazone tablets .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• New onset or worsening diabetic macular edema with decreased visual acuity .
• [ see ] Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) • Fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure .
• [ see ] Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) Postmarketing reports of congestive heart failure have been reported in patients treated with pioglitazone tablets , both with and without previously known heart disease and both with and without concomitant insulin administration .
In postmarketing experience , there have been reports of unusually rapid increases in weight and increases in excess of that generally observed in clinical trials .
Patients who experience such increases should be assessed for fluid accumulation and volume - related events such as excessive edema and congestive heart failure .
[ see and ] Boxed WarningWarnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors ( e . g . , gemfibrozil ) increase pioglitazone concentrations .
Limit pioglitazone tablets dose to 15 mg daily .
( , ) • 2 . 37 . 1 • CYP2C8 inducers ( e . g . , rifampin ) may decrease pioglitazone concentrations .
( ) • 7 . 2 7 . 1 Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors An inhibitor of CYP2C8 ( e . g . , gemfibrozil ) significantly increases the exposure ( area under the serum concentration - time curve or AUC ) and half - life of pioglitazone .
Therefore , the maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone tablets is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors [ see and ] .
Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) 7 . 2 CYP2C8 Inducers An inducer of CYP2C8 ( e . g . , rifampin ) may significantly decrease the exposure ( AUC ) of pioglitazone .
Therefore , if an inducer of CYP2C8 is started or stopped during treatment with pioglitazone tablets , changes in diabetes treatment may be needed based on clinical response without exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 45 mg for pioglitazone tablets .
[ see ] Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy Category C : Based on animal data , may cause fetal harm ( ) • 8 . 1 • Nursing mothers : Discontinue drug or nursing , taking into consideration the importance of the drug to the mother ( ) • 8 . 3 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of pioglitazone tablets in pregnant women .
Animal studies show increased rates of post - implantation loss , delayed development , reduced fetal weights , and delayed parturition at doses 10 to 40 times the maximum recommended human dose .
Pioglitazone tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Clinical Considerations Abnormal blood glucose concentrations during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital anomalies , as well as increased neonatal morbidity and mortality .
Most experts recommend the use of insulin during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose concentrations as close to normal as possible for patients with diabetes .
Animal Data In animal reproductive studies , pregnant rats and rabbits received pioglitazone at doses up to approximately 17 ( rat ) and 40 ( rabbit ) times the maximum recommended human oral dose ( MRHD ) based on body surface area ( mg / m ) ; no teratogenicity was observed .
Increases in embryotoxicity ( increased postimplantation losses , delayed development , reduced fetal weights , and delayed parturition ) occurred in rats that received oral doses approximately 10 or more times the MRHD ( mg / m basis ) .
No functional or behavioral toxicity was observed in rat offspring .
When pregnant rats received pioglitazone during late gestation and lactation , delayed postnatal development , attributed to decreased body weight , occurred in rat offspring at oral maternal doses approximately two or more times the MRHD ( mg / m basis ) .
In rabbits , embryotoxicity occurred at oral doses approximately 40 times the MRHD ( mg / m basis ) .
2 [ see ] Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 3 ) 222 8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether pioglitazone tablets are secreted in human milk .
Pioglitazone is secreted in the milk of lactating rats .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , and because of the potential for pioglitazone tablets to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants , a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or discontinue pioglitazone tablets , taking into account the importance of pioglitazone tablets to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of pioglitazone tablets in pediatric patients have not been established .
Use in pediatric patients is not recommended for the treatment of diabetes due to lack of long - term safety data .
Risks including fractures and other adverse effects associated with pioglitazone tablets have not been determined in this population [ see ] .
Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) 8 . 5 Geriatric Use A total of 92 patients ( 15 . 2 % ) treated with pioglitazone tablets in the three pooled 16 - to 26 - week double - blind , placebo - controlled , monotherapy trials were ≥ 65 years old and two patients ( 0 . 3 % ) were ≥ 75 years old .
In the two pooled 16 - to 24 - week add - on to sulfonylurea trials , 201 patients ( 18 . 7 % ) treated with pioglitazone tablets were ≥ 65 years old and 19 ( 1 . 8 % ) were ≥ 75 years old .
In the two pooled 16 - to 24 - week add - on to metformin trials , 155 patients ( 15 . 5 % ) treated with pioglitazone tablets were ≥ 65 years old and 19 ( 1 . 9 % ) were ≥ 75 years old .
In the two pooled 16 - to 24 - week add - on to insulin trials , 272 patients ( 25 . 4 % ) treated with pioglitazone tablets were ≥ 65 years old and 22 ( 2 . 1 % ) were ≥ 75 years old .
In PROactive , 1068 patients ( 41 . 0 % ) treated with pioglitazone tablets were ≥ 65 years old and 42 ( 1 . 6 % ) were ≥ 75 years old .
In pharmacokinetic studies with pioglitazone , no significant differences were observed in pharmacokinetic parameters between elderly and younger patients .
These clinical experiences have not identified differences in effectiveness and safety between the elderly ( ≥ 65 years ) and younger patients although small sample sizes for patients ≥ 75 years old limit conclusions .
[ see ] Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) 10 OVERDOSAGE During controlled clinical trials , one case of overdose with pioglitazone tablets was reported .
A male patient took 120 mg per day for four days , then 180 mg per day for seven days .
The patient denied any clinical symptoms during this period .
In the event of overdosage , appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient ' s clinical signs and symptoms .
11 DESCRIPTION Pioglitazone tablets are an oral antidiabetic medication .
Pioglitazone [ ( ± ) - 5 - [ [ 4 - [ 2 - ( 5 - ethyl - 2 - pyridinyl ) ethoxy ] phenyl ] methyl ] - 2 , 4 - ] thiazolidinedione monohydrochloride contains one asymmetric carbon , and the compound is synthesized and used as the racemic mixture .
The two enantiomers of pioglitazone interconvert .
No differences were found in the pharmacologic activity between the two enantiomers .
The structural formula is as shown : in vivo [ MULTIMEDIA ] Pioglitazone hydrochloride is an odorless white crystalline powder that has a molecular formula of C H N O S • HCl and a molecular weight of 392 . 90 daltons .
It is soluble in - dimethylformamide , slightly soluble in anhydrous ethanol , very slightly soluble in acetone and acetonitrile , practically insoluble in water , and insoluble in ether .
192023 N , N Pioglitazone Tablets are available as a tablet for oral administration containing 15 mg , 30 mg , or 45 mg of pioglitazone ( as the base ) formulated with the following excipients : lactose monohydrate NF , hydroxypropylcellulose NF , carboxymethylcellulose calcium NF , and magnesium stearate NF .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Pioglitazone tablets are a thiazolidinedione that depends on the presence of insulin for its mechanism of action .
Pioglitazone tablets decrease insulin resistance in the periphery and in the liver resulting in increased insulin - dependent glucose disposal and decreased hepatic glucose output .
Pioglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue .
Pioglitazone is an agonist for peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma ( PPARγ ) .
PPAR receptors are found in tissues important for insulin action such as adipose tissue , skeletal muscle , and liver .
Activation of PPARγ nuclear receptors modulates the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism .
In animal models of diabetes , pioglitazone reduces the hyperglycemia , hyperinsulinemia , and hypertriglyceridemia characteristic of insulin - resistant states such as type 2 diabetes .
The metabolic changes produced by pioglitazone result in increased responsiveness of insulin - dependent tissues and are observed in numerous animal models of insulin resistance .
Because pioglitazone enhances the effects of circulating insulin ( by decreasing insulin resistance ) , it does not lower blood glucose in animal models that lack endogenous insulin .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Clinical studies demonstrate that pioglitazone tablets improve insulin sensitivity in insulin - resistant patients .
Pioglitazone tablets enhance cellular responsiveness to insulin , increase insulin - dependent glucose disposal and improve hepatic sensitivity to insulin .
In patients with type 2 diabetes , the decreased insulin resistance produced by pioglitazone tablets results in lower plasma glucose concentrations , lower plasma insulin concentrations , and lower HbA1c values .
In controlled clinical trials , pioglitazone tablets had an additive effect on glycemic control when used in combination with a sulfonylurea , metformin , or insulin .
[ see ] Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) Patients with lipid abnormalities were included in clinical trials with pioglitazone tablets .
Overall , patients treated with pioglitazone tablets had mean decreases in serum triglycerides , mean increases in HDL cholesterol , and no consistent mean changes in LDL and total cholesterol .
There is no conclusive evidence of macrovascular benefit with pioglitazone tablets or any other antidiabetic medication .
[ see and ] Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) In a 26 - week , placebo - controlled , dose - ranging monotherapy study , mean serum triglycerides decreased in the 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg pioglitazone tablets dose groups compared to a mean increase in the placebo group .
Mean HDL cholesterol increased to a greater extent in patients treated with pioglitazone tablets than in the placebo - treated patients .
There were no consistent differences for LDL and total cholesterol in patients treated with pioglitazone tablets compared to placebo ( ) .

12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following once - daily administration of pioglitazone tablets , steady - state serum concentrations of both pioglitazone and its major active metabolites , M - III ( keto derivative of pioglitazone ) and M - IV ( hydroxyl derivative of pioglitazone ) , are achieved within seven days .
At steady - state , M - III and M - IV reach serum concentrations equal to or greater than that of pioglitazone .
At steady - state , in both healthy volunteers and patients with type 2 diabetes , pioglitazone comprises approximately 30 % to 50 % of the peak total pioglitazone serum concentrations ( pioglitazone plus active metabolites ) and 20 % to 25 % of the total AUC .
Maximum serum concentration ( C ) , AUC , and trough serum concentrations ( C ) for pioglitazone and M - III and M - IV , increased proportionally with administered doses of 15 mg and 30 mg per day .
maxmin Absorption Following oral administration of pioglitazone , peak concentrations of pioglitazone were observed within two hours .
Food slightly delays the time to peak serum concentration ( T ) to three to four hours but does not alter the extent of absorption ( AUC ) .
max Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution ( Vd / F ) of pioglitazone following single - dose administration is 0 . 63 ± 0 . 41 ( mean ± SD ) L / kg of body weight .
Pioglitazone is extensively protein bound ( > 99 % ) in human serum , principally to serum albumin .
Pioglitazone also binds to other serum proteins , but with lower affinity .
M - III and M - IV are also extensively bound ( > 98 % ) to serum albumin .
Metabolism Pioglitazone is extensively metabolized by hydroxylation and oxidation ; the metabolites also partly convert to glucuronide or sulfate conjugates .
Metabolites M - III and M - IV are the major circulating active metabolites in humans .
data demonstrate that multiple CYP isoforms are involved in the metabolism of pioglitazone .
The cytochrome P450 isoforms involved are CYP2C8 and , to a lesser degree , CYP3A4 with additional contributions from a variety of other isoforms including the mainly extrahepatic CYP1A1 .
study of pioglitazone in combination with gemfibrozil , a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor , showed that pioglitazone is a CYP2C8 substrate .
Urinary 6ß - hydroxycortisol / cortisol ratios measured in patients treated with pioglitazone tablets showed that pioglitazone is not a strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducer .
In vitroIn vivo [ see and ] Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) Drug Interactions ( 7 ) Excretion and Elimination Following oral administration , approximately 15 % to 30 % of the pioglitazone dose is recovered in the urine .
Renal elimination of pioglitazone is negligible , and the drug is excreted primarily as metabolites and their conjugates .
It is presumed that most of the oral dose is excreted into the bile either unchanged or as metabolites and eliminated in the feces .
The mean serum half - life of pioglitazone and its metabolites ( M - III and M - IV ) range from 3 to 7 hours and 16 to 24 hours , respectively .
Pioglitazone has an apparent clearance , CL / F , calculated to be 5 to 7 L / hr .
Renal Impairment The serum elimination half - life of pioglitazone , M - III , and M - IV remains unchanged in patients with moderate ( creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL / min ) and severe ( creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min ) renal impairment when compared to subjects with normal renal function .
Therefore , no dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment is required .
Hepatic Impairment Compared with healthy controls , subjects with impaired hepatic function ( Child - Turcotte - Pugh Grade B / C ) have an approximate 45 % reduction in pioglitazone and total pioglitazone ( pioglitazone , M - III , and M - IV ) mean peak concentrations but no change in the mean AUC values .
Therefore , no dose adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment is required .
There are postmarketing reports of liver failure with pioglitazone tablets and clinical trials have generally excluded patients with serum ALT > 2 . 5 x the upper limit of the reference range .
Use caution in patients with liver disease .
[ see ] Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) Geriatric Patients In healthy elderly subjects , peak serum concentrations of pioglitazone are not significantly different , but AUC values are approximately 21 % higher than those achieved in younger subjects .
The mean terminal half - life values of pioglitazone were also longer in elderly subjects ( about 10 hours ) as compared to younger subjects ( about seven hours ) .
These changes were not of a magnitude that would be considered clinically relevant .
Pediatric Patients Safety and efficacy of pioglitazone in pediatric patients have not been established .
Pioglitazone tablets are not recommended for use in pediatric patients .
[ see ] Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) Gender The mean C and AUC values of pioglitazone were increased 20 % to 60 % in women compared to men .
In controlled clinical trials , HbA1c decreases from baseline were generally greater for females than for males ( average mean difference in HbA1c 0 . 5 % ) .
Because therapy should be individualized for each patient to achieve glycemic control , no dose adjustment is recommended based on gender alone .
max Ethnicity Pharmacokinetic data among various ethnic groups are not available .
