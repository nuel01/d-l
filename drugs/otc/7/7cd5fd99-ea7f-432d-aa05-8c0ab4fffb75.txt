WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Severe hepatic injury and fatal hepatic failure have been observed .
Monitor serum transaminase levels prior to starting treatment with bicalutamide , at regular intervals for the first four months of treatment and periodically thereafter , and for symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatic dysfunction .
Use bicalutamide with caution in patients with hepatic impairment .
( 5 . 1 ) • Gynecomastia and breast pain have been reported during treatment with bicalutamide 150 mg when used as a single agent .
( 5 . 2 ) • Bicalutamide is used in combination with an LHRH agonist .
LHRH agonists have been shown to cause a reduction in glucose tolerance in males .
Consideration should be given to monitoring blood glucose in patients receiving bicalutamide in combination with LHRH agonists .
( 5 . 3 ) • Monitoring Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) is recommended .
Evaluate for clinical progression if PSA increases .
( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 .
Hepatitis Cases of death or hospitalization due to severe liver injury ( hepatic failure ) have been reported post - marketing in association with the use of bicalutamide .
Hepatotoxicity in these reports generally occurred within the first three to four months of treatment .
Hepatitis or marked increases in liver enzymes leading to drug discontinuation occurred in approximately 1 % of bicalutamide patients in controlled clinical trials .
Serum transaminase levels should be measured prior to starting treatment with bicalutamide , at regular intervals for the first four months of treatment , and periodically thereafter .
If clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of liver dysfunction occur ( e . g . , nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , fatigue , anorexia , “ flu - like ” symptoms , dark urine , jaundice , or right upper quadrant tenderness ) , the serum transaminases , in particular the serum ALT , should be measured immediately .
If at any time a patient has jaundice , or their ALT rises above two times the upper limit of normal , bicalutamide should be immediately discontinued with close follow - up of liver function .
5 . 2 .
Gynecomastia and Breast Pain In clinical trials with bicalutamide 150 mg as a single agent for prostate cancer , gynecomastia and breast pain have been reported in up to 38 % and 39 % of patients , respectively .
5 . 3 .
Glucose Tolerance A reduction in glucose tolerance has been observed in males receiving LHRH agonists .
This may manifest as diabetes or loss of glycemic control in those with pre - existing diabetes .
Consideration should therefore be given to monitoring blood glucose in patients receiving bicalutamide in combination with LHRH agonists .
5 . 4 .
Laboratory Tests Regular assessments of serum Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) may be helpful in monitoring the patient ’ s response .
If PSA levels rise during bicalutamide therapy , the patient should be evaluated for clinical progression .
For patients who have objective progression of disease together with an elevated PSA , a treatment - free period of antiandrogen , while continuing the LHRH analog , may be considered .

6 . 2 .
Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of bicalutamide .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Uncommon cases of hypersensitivity reactions , including angioneurotic edema and urticaria have been seen [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 1 ) ] .
Cases of interstitial lung disease ( some fatal ) , including interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis , have been reported with bicalutamide .
Interstitial lung disease has been reported most often at doses greater than 50 mg .
A few cases of fatal hepatic failure have been reported .
Reduction in glucose tolerance , manifesting as diabetes or a loss of glycemic control in those with pre - existing diabetes , has been reported during treatment with LHRH agonists .
7 .
DRUG INTERACTIONS Clinical studies have not shown any drug interactions between bicalutamide and LHRH analogs ( goserelin or leuprolide ) .
There is no evidence that bicalutamide induces hepatic enzymes .
In vitro studies have shown that R - bicalutamide is an inhibitor of CYP 3A4 with lesser inhibitory effects on CYP 2C9 , 2C19 and 2D6 activity .
Clinical studies have shown that with co - administration of bicalutamide , mean midazolam ( a CYP 3A4 substrate ) levels may be increased 1 . 5 fold ( for Cmax ) and 1 . 9 fold ( for AUC ) .
Hence , caution should be exercised when bicalutamide is co - administered with CYP 3A4 substrates .
In vitro protein - binding studies have shown that bicalutamide can displace coumarin anticoagulants from binding sites .
Prothrombin times should be closely monitored in patients already receiving coumarin anticoagulants who are started on bicalutamide and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary .
• R - bicalutamide is an inhibitor of CYP 3A4 ; therefore , caution should be used when bicalutamide is co - administered with CYP 3A4 substrates .
( 7 ) • Prothrombin times should be closely monitored in patient already receiving coumarin anticoagulants who are started on bicalutamide .

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric patients : Efficacy has not been demonstrated for the treatment of familial male - limited precocious puberty ( testotoxicosis ) .
( 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 .
Pregnancy PREGNANCY CATEGORY X [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 3 ) ] .
Based on its mechanism of action , bicalutamide may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Bicalutamide is contraindicated in women , including those who are or may become pregnant .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus .
While there are no human data on the use of bicalutamide in pregnancy and bicalutamide is not for use in women , it is important to know that maternal use of an androgen receptor inhibitor could affect development of the fetus .
In animal reproduction studies , male offspring of rats receiving doses of 10 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 / 3 of clinical exposure at the recommended dose ) and above , were observed to have reduced anogenital distance and hypospadias .
These pharmacological effects have been observed with other antiandrogens .
No other teratogenic effects were observed in rabbits receiving doses up to 200 mg / kg / day ( approximately 1 / 3 of clinical exposure at the recommended dose ) or rats receiving doses up to 250 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 times the clinical exposure at the recommended dose ) .

Nursing Mothers Bicalutamide is not indicated for use in women .
8 . 4 .
Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of bicalutamide in pediatric patients have not been established .
Bicalutamide orodispersible tablet was studied in combination with anastrozole orodispersible tablet in an open - label , non - comparative , multi - center study that assessed the efficacy and safety of this combination regimen over 12 months in the treatment of gonadotropin - independent precocious puberty in boys with familial male - limited precocious puberty , also known as testotoxicosis .
Patients were enrolled in the study if they had a baseline age ≥ 2 years and a diagnosis of testotoxicosis based on clinical features of progressive precocious puberty , symmetrical testicular enlargement , advanced bone age , pubertal levels of serum testosterone , prepubertal pattern of gonadotropin secretion following a GnRH stimulation test , and absence of other clinical and biochemical causes of testosterone excess .
Thirteen out of the 14 patients enrolled completed 12 months of combination treatment ( one patient was lost to follow - up ) .
If central precocious puberty ( CPP ) developed an LHRH analog was to be added .
Four patients were diagnosed with CPP during the 12 - month study and received LHRH analog treatment and 2 additional patients were diagnosed at the end of the 12 months and received treatment subsequently .
Mean ± SD characteristics at baseline were as follows : chronological age : 3 . 9 ± 1 . 9 years ; bone age 8 . 8 ± 2 . 5 ; bone age / chronological age ratio : 2 . 06 ± 0 . 51 ; growth rate ( cm / yr ) : 10 . 81 ± 4 . 22 ; growth rate standard deviation score ( SDS ) : 0 . 41 ± 1 . 36 .
The starting bicalutamide dose was 12 . 5 mg .
Bicalutamide was titrated in each patient until steady - state R - bicalutamide ( the active isomer of bicalutamide ) trough plasma concentration reached 5 to 15 mcg / mL , which is the range of therapeutic concentrations achieved in adults with prostate cancer following the administration of the currently approved bicalutamide dose of 50 mg .
The starting daily dose of anastrozole was 0 . 5 mg .
Anastrozole was independently titrated in each patient until it reached at steady - state a serum estradiol concentration of < 10 pmol / L ( 2 . 7 pg / mL ) .
The following ascending doses were used for bicalutamide : 12 . 5 mg , 25 mg , 50 mg , and 100 mg .
For anastrozole there were two ascending doses : 0 . 5 mg and 1 mg .
At the end of the titration phase 1 patient was on 12 . 5 mg bicalutamide , 8 patients were on 50 mg bicalutamide , and 4 patients were on 100 mg bicalutamide ; 10 patients were on 0 . 5 mg anastrozole and 3 patients were on 1 mg anastrozole .
In the majority of patients , steady - state trough concentrations of R - bicalutamide appeared to be attained by Day 21 with once daily dosing .
Steady - state trough plasma anastrozole concentrations appeared to be attained by Day 8 .
The primary efficacy analysis of the study was to assess the change in growth rate after 12 months of treatment , relative to the growth rate during the ≥ 6 months prior to entering the study .
Pre - study growth rates were obtained retrospectively .
There was no statistical evidence that the growth rate was reduced during treatment .
During bicalutamide / anastrozole treatment the mean growth rate ( cm / yr ) decreased by 1 . 6 cm / year , 95 % CI ( - 4 . 7 to 1 . 5 ) p = 0 . 28 ; the mean growth rate SDS decreased by 0 . 1 SD , 95 % CI ( – 1 . 2 to 1 . 0 ) p = 0 . 88 .
Table 2 shows descriptive data for growth rates for the overall population and for subgroups defined by history of previous treatment for testotoxicosis with ketoconazole , spironolactone , anastrozole or other aromatase inhibitors .

Estradiol concentrations were at or below the level of quantification ( 9 . 81 pmol / L ) for 11 of 12 patients after 12 months of treatment .
Six of the 12 patients started treatment at an estradiol concentration below the level of quantification .
There were no deaths , serious adverse events , or discontinuations due to adverse events during the study .
Of the 14 patients exposed to study treatment , 13 ( 92 . 9 % ) experienced at least one adverse event .
The most frequently reported ( > 3 patients ) adverse events were gynecomastia ( 7 / 14 , 50 % ) , central precocious puberty ( 6 / 14 , 43 % ) , vomiting ( 5 / 14 , 36 % ) , headache ( 3 / 14 , 21 % ) , pyrexia ( 3 / 14 , 21 % ) and upper respiratory tract infection ( 3 / 14 , 21 % ) .
Adverse reactions considered possibly related to bicalutamide by investigators included gynecomastia ( 6 / 14 , 43 % ) , central precocious puberty ( 2 / 14 , 14 % ) , breast tenderness ( 2 / 14 , 14 % ) , breast pain ( 1 / 14 , 7 % ) , asthenia ( 1 / 14 , 7 % ) , increased alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] ( 1 / 14 , 7 % ) , increased aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ] ( 1 / 14 , 7 % ) , and musculoskeletal chest pain ( 1 / 14 , 7 % ) .
Headache was the only adverse reaction considered possibly related to anastrazole by investigators .
For the patient who developed elevated ALT and AST , the elevation was < 3 X ULN , and returned to normal without stopping treatment ; there was no concomitant elevation in total bilirubin .
8 . 5 .
Geriatric Use In two studies in patients given 50 or 150 mg daily , no significant relationship between age and steady - state levels of total bicalutamide or the active R - enantiomer has been shown .
8 . 6 .
Hepatic Impairment Bicalutamide should be used with caution in patients with moderate - to - severe hepatic impairment .
Bicalutamide is extensively metabolized by the liver .
Limited data in subjects with severe hepatic impairment suggest that excretion of bicalutamide may be delayed and could lead to further accumulation .
Periodic liver function tests should be considered for hepatic - impaired patients on long - term therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
No clinically significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of either enantiomer of bicalutamide was noted in patients with mild - to - moderate hepatic disease as compared to healthy controls .
However , the half - life of the R - enantiomer was increased approximately 76 % ( 5 . 9 and 10 . 4 days for normal and impaired patients , respectively ) in patients with severe liver disease ( n = 4 ) .
8 . 7 .
Renal Impairment Renal impairment ( as measured by creatinine clearance ) had no significant effect on the elimination of total bicalutamide or the active R - enantiomer .
8 . 8 .
Women Bicalutamide has not been studied in women .
10 .
OVERDOSAGE Long - term clinical trials have been conducted with dosages up to 200 mg of bicalutamide daily and these dosages have been well tolerated .
A single dose of bicalutamide that results in symptoms of an overdose considered to be life threatening has not been established .
There is no specific antidote ; treatment of an overdose should be symptomatic .
In the management of an overdose with bicalutamide , vomiting may be induced if the patient is alert .
It should be remembered that , in this patient population , multiple drugs may have been taken .
Dialysis is not likely to be helpful since bicalutamide is highly protein bound and is extensively metabolized .
General supportive care , including frequent monitoring of vital signs and close observation of the patient , is indicated .
11 .

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 .
Mechanism of Action Bicalutamide is a non - steroidal androgen receptor inhibitor .
It competitively inhibits the action of androgens by binding to cytosol androgen receptors in the target tissue .
Prostatic carcinoma is known to be androgen sensitive and responds to treatment that counteracts the effect of androgen and / or removes the source of androgen .
When bicalutamide is combined with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone ( LHRH ) analog therapy , the suppression of serum testosterone induced by the LHRH analog is not affected .
However , in clinical trials with bicalutamide as a single agent for prostate cancer , rises in serum testosterone and estradiol have been noted .
In a subset of patients who have been treated with bicalutamide and an LHRH agonist , and who discontinue bicalutamide therapy due to progressive advanced prostate cancer , a reduction in Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) and / or clinical improvement ( antiandrogen withdrawal phenomenon ) may be observed .
12 . 3 .
Pharmacokinetics Absorption Bicalutamide is well - absorbed following oral administration , although the absolute bioavailability is unknown .
Co - administration of bicalutamide with food has no clinically significant effect on rate or extent of absorption .
Distribution Bicalutamide is highly protein - bound ( 96 % ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Metabolism / Elimination Bicalutamide undergoes stereospecific metabolism .
The S ( inactive ) isomer is metabolized primarily by glucuronidation .
The R ( active ) isomer also undergoes glucuronidation but is predominantly oxidized to an inactive metabolite followed by glucuronidation .
Both the parent and metabolite glucuronides are eliminated in the urine and feces .
The S - enantiomer is rapidly cleared relative to the R - enantiomer , with the R - enantiomer accounting for about 99 % of total steady - state plasma levels .
Pharmacokinetics of the active enantiomer of bicalutamide in normal males and patients with prostate cancer are presented in Table 3 .

NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Two - year oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in both male and female rats and mice at doses of 5 , 15 or 75 mg / kg / day of bicalutamide .
A variety of tumor target organ effects were identified and were attributed to the antiandrogenicity of bicalutamide , namely , testicular benign interstitial ( Leydig ) cell tumors in male rats at all dose levels ( the steady - state plasma concentration with the 5 mg / kg / day dose is approximately 2 / 3 human therapeutic concentrations [ 1 ] ) and uterine adenocarcinoma in female rats at 75 mg / kg / day ( approximately 1 1 / 2 times the human therapeutic concentrations null ) .
There is no evidence of Leydig cell hyperplasia in patients ; uterine tumors are not relevant to the indicated patient population .
A small increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in male mice given 75 mg / kg / day of bicalutamide ( approximately 4 times human therapeutic concentrations null ) and an increased incidence of benign thyroid follicular cell adenomas in rats given 5 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 / 3 human therapeutic concentrations null ) and above were recorded .
These neoplastic changes were progressions of non - neoplastic changes related to hepatic enzyme induction observed in animal toxicity studies .
Enzyme induction has not been observed following bicalutamide administration in man .
There were no tumorigenic effects suggestive of genotoxic carcinogenesis .
A comprehensive battery of both in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests ( yeast gene conversion , Ames , E . coli , CHO / HGPRT , human lymphocyte cytogenetic , mouse micronucleus , and rat bone marrow cytogenetic tests ) has demonstrated that bicalutamide does not have genotoxic activity .
Administration of bicalutamide may lead to inhibition of spermatogenesis .
The long - term effects of bicalutamide on male fertility have not been studied .
In male rats dosed at 250 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 times human therapeutic concentrations null ) , the precoital interval and time to successful mating were increased in the first pairing but no effects on fertility following successful mating were seen .
These effects were reversed by 7 weeks after the end of an 11 - week period of dosing .
No effects on female rats dosed at 10 , 50 and 250 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 / 3 , 1 and 2 times human therapeutic concentrations , respectively null ) or their female offspring were observed .
Administration of bicalutamide to pregnant females resulted in feminization of the male offspring leading to hypospadias at all dose levels .
Affected male offspring were also impotent .

CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 .
Bicalutamide Tablets 50 mg Daily in Combination with an LHRH - A In a multicenter , double - blind , controlled clinical trial , 813 patients with previously untreated advanced prostate cancer were randomized to receive bicalutamide 50 mg once daily ( 404 patients ) or flutamide 250 mg ( 409 patients ) three times a day , each in combination with LHRH analogs ( either goserelin acetate implant or leuprolide acetate depot ) .
In an analysis conducted after a median follow - up of 160 weeks was reached , 213 ( 52 . 7 % ) patients treated with bicalutamide - LHRH analog therapy and 235 ( 57 . 5 % ) patients treated with flutamide - LHRH analog therapy had died .
There was no significant difference in survival between treatment groups ( see Figure 1 ) .
The hazard ratio for time to death ( survival ) was 0 . 87 ( 95 % confidence interval 0 . 72 to 1 . 05 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] There was no significant difference in time to objective tumor progression between treatment groups ( see Figure 2 ) .
Objective tumor progression was defined as the appearance of any bone metastases or the worsening of any existing bone metastases on bone scan attributable to metastatic disease , or an increase by 25 % or more of any existing measurable extraskeletal metastases .
The hazard ratio for time to progression of bicalutamide plus LHRH analog to that of flutamide plus LHRH analog was 0 . 93 ( 95 % confidence interval , 0 . 79 to 1 . 10 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Quality of life was assessed with self - administered patient questionnaires on pain , social functioning , emotional well being , vitality , activity limitation , bed disability , overall health , physical capacity , general symptoms , and treatment related symptoms .

Safety Data from Clinical Studies using Bicalutamide Tablets 150 mg Bicalutamide tablet 150 mg is not approved for use either alone or with other treatments .
Two identical multicenter , randomized , open - label trials comparing bicalutamide 150 mg daily monotherapy to castration were conducted in patients that had locally advanced ( T3 - 4 , NX , MO ) or metastatic ( M1 ) prostate cancer .
Monotherapy – M1 Group Bicalutamide 150 mg daily is not approved for use in patients with M1 cancer of the prostate .
Based on an interim analysis of the two trials for survival , the Data Safety Monitoring Board recommended that bicalutamide treatment be discontinued in the M1 patients because the risk of death was 25 % ( HR 1 . 25 , 95 % CI 0 . 87 to 1 . 81 ) and 31 % ( HR 1 . 31 , 95 % CI 0 . 97 to 1 . 77 ) higher in the bicalutamide treated group compared to that in the castrated group , respectively .
Locally Advanced ( T3 - 4 , NX , MO ) Group Bicalutamide 150 mg daily is not approved for use in patients with locally advanced ( T3 - 4 , NX , MO ) cancer of the prostate .
Following discontinuation of all M1 patients , the trials continued with the T3 - 4 , NX , MO patients until study completion .
In the larger trial ( N = 352 ) , the risk of death was 25 % ( HR 1 . 25 , 95 % CI 0 . 92 to 1 . 71 ) higher in the bicalutamide group and in the smaller trial ( N = 140 ) , the risk of death was 36 % ( HR 0 . 64 , 95 % CI , 0 . 39 to 1 . 03 ) lower in the bicalutamide group .
In addition to the above two studies , there are three other on - going clinical studies that provide additional safety information for bicalutamide 150 mg , a dose that is not approved for use .
These are three multicenter , randomized , double - blind , parallel group trials comparing bicalutamide 150 mg daily monotherapy ( adjuvant to previous therapy or under watchful waiting ) with placebo , for death or time to disease progression , in a population of 8113 patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer .
Bicalutamide 150 mg daily is not approved for use as therapy for patients with localized prostate cancer who are candidates for watchful waiting .
Data from a planned subgroup analysis of two of these trials in 1627 patients with localized prostate cancer who were under watchful waiting , revealed a trend toward decreased survival in the bicalutamide arm after a median follow - up of 7 . 4 years .
There were 294 ( 37 . 7 % ) deaths in the bicalutamide treated patients versus 279 ( 32 . 9 % ) deaths in the placebo treated patients ( localized watchful waiting group ) for a hazard ratio of 1 . 16 ( 95 % CI 0 . 99 to 1 . 37 ) .
