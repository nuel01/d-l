Therapeutic Category : Antispasmodic , anticholinergic .
Meets USP Dissolution Test 2 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle .
Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle , but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity .
No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia ( antinicotinic effects ) .
Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle .
In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions , cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin chloride increases bladder ( vesical ) capacity , diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle , and delays the initial desire to void .
Oxybutynin chloride thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination .
Antimuscarinic activity resides predominately in the R - isomer .
A metabolite , desethyloxybutynin , has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies .
Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of oxybutynin chloride tablets , oxybutynin is rapidly absorbed achieving Cmax within an hour , following which plasma concentration decreases with an effective half - life of approximately 2 to 3 hours .
The absolute bioavailability of oxybutynin is reported to be about 6 % ( range 1 . 6 to 10 . 9 % ) for the tablets .
Wide interindividual variation in pharmacokinetic parameters is evident following oral administration of oxybutynin .
The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R - and S - oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1 .
The plasma concentration - time profiles for R - and S - oxybutynin are similar in shape ; Figure 1 shows the profile for R - oxybutynin .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] Oxybutynin chloride steady - state pharmacokinetics were also studied in 11 pediatric patients with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition ( e . g . , spina bifida ) .
These pediatric patients were on oxybutynin chloride tablets with total daily dose ranging from 7 . 5 mg to 15 mg ( 0 . 22 to 0 . 53 mg / kg ) .
Overall , most patients ( 86 . 9 % ) were taking a total daily oxybutynin chloride dose between 10 mg and 15 mg .
Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples .
When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily oxybutynin chloride , the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R - and S - oxybutynin and R - and S - desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2 .
The plasma - time concentration profiles for R - and S - oxybutynin are similar in shape ; Figure 2 shows the profile for R - oxybutynin when all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg twice daily .

– Plot represents all available data normalized to the equivalent of oxybutynin chloride 5 mg BID or TID at steady state [ MULTIMEDIA ] Food Effects Data in the literature suggests that oxybutynin solution co - administered with food resulted in a slight delay in absorption and an increase in its bioavailability by 25 % ( n = 18 ) . 1 Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption .
The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride .
Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound ( > 99 % ) to plasma proteins .
Both enantiomers of desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound ( > 97 % ) to plasma proteins .
The major binding protein is alpha - 1 acid glycoprotein .
Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems , particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall .
Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid , which is pharmacologically inactive , and desethyloxybutynin , which is pharmacologically active .
Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver , with less than 0 . 1 % of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine .
Also , less than 0 . 1 % of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride was well tolerated in patients administered the drug in controlled studies of 30 days ’ duration and in uncontrolled studies in which some of the patients received the drug for 2 years .
INDICATIONS & USAGE Oxybutynin chloride tablets , USP are indicated for the relief of symptoms of bladder instability associated with voiding in patients with uninhibited neurogenic or reflex neurogenic bladder ( i . e . , urgency , frequency , urinary leakage , urge incontinence , dysuria ) .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Oxybutynin chloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with urinary retention , gastric retention and other severe decreased gastrointestinal motility conditions , uncontrolled narrow - angle glaucoma and in patients who are at risk for these conditions .
Oxybutynin chloride tablets are also contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug substance or other components of the product .
WARNINGS Angioedema of the face , lips , tongue and / or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin .
In some cases , angioedema occurred after the first dose .
Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life - threatening .
If involvement of the tongue , hypopharynx , or larynx occurs , oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and / or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided .
PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system ( CNS ) effects ( See ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported , including hallucinations , agitation , confusion and somnolence .
Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects , particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose .
If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects , dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered .
Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms .
Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with Parkinson ’ s disease due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms .
General Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in the frail elderly , in patients with hepatic or renal impairment , and in patients with myasthenia gravis .
Oxybutynin chloride may aggravate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism , coronary heart disease , congestive heart failure , cardiac arrhythmias , hiatal hernia , tachycardia , hypertension , myasthenia gravis , and prostatic hypertrophy .
Urinary Retention Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Gastrointestinal Disorders Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms of decreased gastrointestinal motility .
Oxybutynin chloride should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Administration of oxybutynin chloride to patients with ulcerative colitis may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and precipitate or aggravate toxic megacolon , a serious complication of the disease .
Oxybutynin chloride , like other anticholinergic drugs , may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis , and intestinal atony .
Oxybutynin chloride should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and / or who are concurrently taking drugs ( such as bisphosphonates ) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis .
Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life - threatening airway obstruction .
Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue , edema of the laryngopharynx , or difficulty breathing .
Patients should be informed that heat prostration ( fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating ) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature .
Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness ( somnolence ) , or blurred vision , patients should be advised to exercise caution .
Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin .
Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth , constipation , somnolence ( drowsiness ) , and / or other anticholinergic - like effects may increase the frequency and / or severity of such effects .
Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility .
This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index .
Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents , such as metoclopramide .
Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 3 to 4 fold higher when oxybutynin was administered with ketoconazole , a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor .
Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system , such as antimycotic agents ( e . g . , itraconazole and miconazole ) or macrolide antibiotics ( e . g . , erythromycin and clarithromycin ) , may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters ( i . e . , Cmax and AUC ) .
The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known .
Caution should be used when such drugs are co - administered .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility A 24 - month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20 , 80 , and 160 mg / kg / day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity .
These doses are approximately 6 , 25 , and 50 times the maximum human exposure , based on surface area .
Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis , Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Salmonella typhimurium test systems .
Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster , rabbit , rat , and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Category B . Reproduction studies using oxybutynin chloride in the hamster , rabbit , rat , and mouse have shown no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus .
The safety of oxybutynin chloride administered to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established .
Therefore , oxybutynin chloride should not be given to pregnant women unless , in the judgment of the physician , the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride administration have been demonstrated for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride tablets were studied in 30 children in a 24 week , open - label trial .
Patients were aged 5 to 15 years , all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition ( e . g . , spina bifida ) , all used clean intermittent catheterization , and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride .
Study results demonstrated that the administration of oxybutynin chloride was associated with improvement in clinical and urodynamic parameters .
At total daily doses ranging from 5 mg to 15 mg , treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 122 mL to 145 mL , an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 168 mL , and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 43 % to 61 % .
Urodynamic results in these patients were consistent with the clinical results .
Treatment with oxybutynin chloride tablets was associated with an increase from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity from 230 mL to 279 mL , a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 36 cm H2O to 33 cm H2O , and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions ( of at least 15 cm H2O ) from 39 % to 20 % .
As there is insufficient clinical data for pediatric populations under age 5 , oxybutynin chloride is not recommended for this age group .
Geriatric Use Clinical studies of oxybutynin chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between healthy elderly and younger patients ; however , a lower initial starting dose of 2 . 5 mg given 2 or 3 times a day has been recommended for the frail elderly due to a prolongation of the elimination half - life from 2 to 3 hours to 5 hours . 2 , 3 , 4 In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride was evaluated in a total of 199 patients in three clinical trials .
These participants were treated with oxybutynin chloride 5 to 20 mg / day for up to 6 weeks .
Table 3 shows the incidence of adverse events judged by investigators to be at least possibly related to treatment and reported by at least 5 % of patients .
