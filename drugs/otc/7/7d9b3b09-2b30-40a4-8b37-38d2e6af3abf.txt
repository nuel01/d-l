Warnings and Precautions ( ) 5 . 8 10 / 2013 1 .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE LANTUS is indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
Important Limitations of Use : • LANTUS is not recommended for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis .
Intravenous short - acting insulin is the preferred treatment for this condition .
LANTUS is a long - acting human insulin analog indicated to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
( ) 1 Important Limitations of Use : • Not recommended for treating diabetic ketoacidosis .
Use intravenous , short - acting insulin instead .
2 .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Individualize dose based on the type of diabetes and whether the patient is insulin - naïve ( , , ) 2 . 12 . 22 . 3 • Administer subcutaneously once daily at any time of day , but at the same time every day .
( ) 2 . 1 • Rotate injection sites within an injection area ( abdomen , thigh , or deltoid ) to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy .
( ) 2 . 1 • Converting from other insulin therapies may require adjustment of timing and dose of LANTUS .
Closely monitor glucoses especially upon converting to LANTUS and during the initial weeks thereafter .
( ) 2 . 3 2 . 1 Dosing LANTUS is a recombinant human insulin analog for once daily subcutaneous administration with potency that is approximately the same as the potency of human insulin .
LANTUS exhibits a relatively constant glucose - lowering profile over 24 hours that permits once - daily dosing .
LANTUS may be administered at any time during the day .
LANTUS should be administered subcutaneously once a day at the same time every day .
The dose of LANTUS must be individualized based on clinical response .
Blood glucose monitoring is essential in all patients receiving insulin therapy .
Patients adjusting the amount or timing of dosing with LANTUS , should only do so under medical supervision with appropriate glucose monitoring . ]
[ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) In patients with type 1 diabetes , LANTUS must be used in regimens with short - acting insulin .
The intended duration of activity of LANTUS is dependent on injection into subcutaneous tissue .
LANTUS should not be administered intravenously or via an insulin pump .
Intravenous administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycemia .
[ see ] Clinical pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) [ see ] Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) As with all insulins , injection sites should be rotated within the same region ( abdomen , thigh , or deltoid ) from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy [ See ] .
Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) In clinical studies , there was no clinically relevant difference in insulin glargine absorption after abdominal , deltoid , or thigh subcutaneous administration .
As for all insulins , the rate of absorption , and consequently the onset and duration of action , may be affected by exercise and other variables , such as stress , intercurrent illness , or changes in co - administered drugs or meal patterns .
2 . 2 Initiation of LANTUS therapy The recommended starting dose of LANTUS in patients with type 1 diabetes should be approximately one - third of the total daily insulin requirements .
Short - acting , premeal insulin should be used to satisfy the remainder of the daily insulin requirements .
The recommended starting dose of LANTUS in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not currently treated with insulin is 10 units ( or 0 . 2 Units / kg ) once daily , which should subsequently be adjusted to the patient ' s needs .
The dose of LANTUS should be adjusted according to blood glucose measurements .
The dosage of LANTUS should be individualized under the supervision of a healthcare provider in accordance with the needs of the patient .
2 . 3 Converting to LANTUS from other insulin therapies If changing from a treatment regimen with an intermediate - or long - acting insulin to a regimen with LANTUS , the amount and timing of shorter - acting insulins and doses of any oral anti - diabetic drugs may need to be adjusted .
• If transferring patients from once - daily NPH insulin to once - daily LANTUS , the recommended initial LANTUS dose is the same as the dose of NPH that is being discontinued .
• If transferring patients from twice - daily NPH insulin to once - daily LANTUS , the recommended initial LANTUS dose is 80 % of the total NPH dose that is being discontinued .
This dose reduction will lower the likelihood of hypoglycemia [ see ] .

CONTRAINDICATIONS LANTUS is contraindicated • In patients with hypersensitivity to LANTUS or one of its excipients [ See ] .
Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) In patients with hypersensitivity to LANTUS or one of its excipients ( ) 4 5 .
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Dose adjustment and monitoring : Monitor blood glucose in all patients treated with insulin .
Modify insulin regimen cautiously and only under medical supervision ( ) 5 . 1 • Administration : Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution .
Do not administer subcutaneously via an insulin pump or intravenously because severe hypoglycemia can occur ( ) 5 . 2 • Do not share reusable or disposable insulin devices or needles between patients ( ) 5 . 2 • Hypoglycemia : May be life - threatening .
Monitor glucose , administer rescue therapy and treat underlying cause .
( , ) 5 . 36 . 1 • Allergic reactions : Severe , life - threatening , generalized allergy , including anaphylaxis , can occur .
Discontinue LANTUS .
monitor and treat if indicated ( , ) 5 . 46 . 1 • Renal or hepatic impairment : Reduce dose of LANTUS if indicated ( , ) 5 . 55 . 6 • : Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure ; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation of TZD if heart failure occurs ( ) Fluid retention and heart failure can occur with concomitant use of thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) 5 . 8 5 . 1 Dosage adjustment and monitoring Glucose monitoring is essential for all patients receiving insulin therapy .
Changes to an insulin regimen should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision .
Changes in insulin strength , manufacturer , type , or method of administration may result in the need for a change in insulin dose or an adjustment in concomitant oral anti - diabetic treatment .
As with all insulin preparations , the time course of action for LANTUS may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on many conditions , including the local blood supply , local temperature , and physical activity .
5 . 2 Administration Do not administer LANTUS intravenously or via an insulin pump .
The intended duration of activity of LANTUS is dependent on injection into subcutaneous tissue Intravenous administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycemia .
[ see ] Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) Do not dilute or mix LANTUS with any other insulin or solution .
If LANTUS is diluted or mixed , the solution may become cloudy , and the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile ( e . g . , onset of action , time to peak effect ) of LANTUS and the mixed insulin may be altered in an unpredictable manner .
When LANTUS and regular human insulin were mixed immediately before injection in dogs , a delayed onset of action and a delayed time to maximum effect for regular human insulin was observed .
The total bioavailability of the mixture was also slightly decreased compared to separate injections of LANTUS and regular human insulin .
The relevance of these observations in dogs to humans is unknown .
Do not share disposable or reusable insulin devices or needles between patients , because doing so carries a risk for transmission of blood - borne pathogens .
5 . 3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction of insulin , including LANTUS .
The risk of hypoglycemia increases with intensive glycemic control .
Patients must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia .
Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or death .
Severe hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person or parenteral glucose infusion or glucagon administration has been observed in clinical trials with insulin , including trials with LANTUS .
The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time - action profile of the administered insulin formulations .
Other factors such as changes in food intake ( e . g . , amount of food or timing of meals ) , exercise , and concomitant medications may also alter the risk of hypoglycemia [ ] .
See Drug Interactions ( 7 ) The prolonged effect of subcutaneous LANTUS may delay recovery from hypoglycemia .
Patients being switched from twice daily NPH insulin to once - daily LANTUS should have their initial LANTUS dose reduced by 20 % from the previous total daily NPH dose to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [ see ] .
Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) As with all insulins , use caution in patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and in patients who may be predisposed to hypoglycemia ( e . g . , the pediatric population and patients who fast or have erratic food intake ) .
The patient ' s ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycemia .
This may present a risk in situations where these abilities are especially important , such as driving or operating other machinery .
Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions , such as longstanding diabetes , diabetic neuropathy , use of medications such as beta - blockers , or intensified glycemic control .
These situations may result in severe hypoglycemia ( and , possibly , loss of consciousness ) prior to the patient ' s awareness of hypoglycemia .
5 . 4 Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions Severe , life - threatening , generalized allergy , including anaphylaxis , can occur with insulin products , including LANTUS .
5 . 5 Renal impairment Due to its long duration of action , Lantus is not recommended during periods of rapidly declining renal function because of the risk for prolonged hypoglycemia .
Although studies have not been performed in patients with diabetes and renal impairment , a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients with renal impairment because of reduced insulin metabolism , similar to observations found with other insulins .
[ See ] .
Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) 5 . 6 Hepatic impairment Due to its long duration of action , Lantus is not recommended during periods of rapidly declining hepatic function because of the risk for prolonged hypoglycemia .
Although studies have not been performed in patients with diabetes and hepatic impairment , a reduction in the LANTUS dose may be required in patients with hepatic impairment because of reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism , similar to observations found with other insulins .
[ See ] .
Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) 5 . 7 Drug interactions Some medications may alter insulin requirements and subsequently increase the risk for hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [ See ] .
Drug Interactions ( 7 ) 5 . 8 Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of PPAR - gamma agonists Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) , which are peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor ( PPAR ) - gamma agonists , can cause dose - related fluid retention , particularly when used in combination with insulin .
Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure .
Patients treated with insulin , including LANTUS , and a PPAR - gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure .
If heart failure develops , it should be managed according to current standards of care , and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR - gamma agonist must be considered .
6 .
ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere : • Hypoglycemia [ See ] Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) • Hypersensitivity and allergic reactions [ See ] Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) Adverse reactions commonly associated with LANTUS include hypoglycemia , allergic reactions , injection site reactions , lipodystrophy , pruritus , rash , edema and weight gain .

6 . 1 Clinical trial experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs , the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared to those rates reported in another clinical trial , and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice .
The frequencies of treatment - emergent adverse events during LANTUS clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below .

Tables 5 , and 6 and 7 summarize the incidence of severe hypoglycemia in the LANTUS individual clinical trials .
Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of another person and associated with either a blood glucose below 50 mg / dL ( ≤ 56 mg / dL in the 5 - year trial and ≤ 36 mg / dL in the ORIGIN trial ) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate , intravenous glucose or glucagon administration .
[ See ] Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) The proportion of patients experiencing severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the LANTUS clinical trials [ ] in adults with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes were comparable for all treatment regimens ( see and ) .
In the pediatric phase 3 clinical trial , children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes had a higher incidence of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the two treatment groups compared to the adult trials with type 1 diabetes .
See Clinical Studies ( 14 ) Tables 56 Table 5 : Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Study A Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study B Type 1 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study C Type 1 Diabetes Adults 16 weeks In combination with insulin lispro Study D Type 1 Diabetes Pediatrics 26 weeks In combination with regular insulin LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH Percent of patients ( n / total N ) 10 . 6 ( 31 / 292 ) 15 . 0 ( 44 / 293 ) 8 . 7 ( 23 / 264 ) 10 . 4 ( 28 / 270 ) 6 . 5 ( 20 / 310 ) 5 . 2 ( 16 / 309 ) 23 . 0 ( 40 / 174 ) 28 . 6 ( 50 / 175 ) Table 6 : Severe Symptomatic Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Study E Type 2 Diabetes Adults 52 weeks In combination with oral agents Study F Type 2 Diabetes Adults 28 weeks In combination with regular insulin Study G Type 2 Diabetes Adults 5 years In combination with regular insulin LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH LANTUS NPH Percent of patients ( n / total N ) 1 . 7 ( 5 / 289 ) 1 . 1 ( 3 / 281 ) 0 . 4 ( 1 / 259 ) 2 . 3 ( 6 / 259 ) 7 . 8 ( 40 / 513 ) 11 . 9 ( 60 / 504 ) Table 7 displays the proportion of patients experiencing severe symptomatic hypoglycemia in the Lantus and Standard Care groups in the ORIGIN Trial [ ] .

The numbers of retinal adverse events reported for LANTUS and NPH insulin treatment groups were similar for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes .
LANTUS was compared to NPH insulin in a 5 - year randomized clinical trial that evaluated the progression of retinopathy as assessed with fundus photography using a grading protocol derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale ( ETDRS ) .
Patients had type 2 diabetes ( mean age 55 yrs ) with no ( 86 % ) or mild ( 14 % ) retinopathy at baseline .
Mean baseline HbA1c was 8 . 4 % .
The primary outcome was progression by 3 or more steps on the ETDRS scale at study endpoint .
Patients with pre - specified post - baseline eye procedures ( pan - retinal photocoagulation for proliferative or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy , local photocoagulation for new vessels , and vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy ) were also considered as 3 - step progressors regardless of actual change in ETDRS score from baseline .
Retinopathy graders were blinded to treatment group assignment .
The results for the primary endpoint are shown in Table 8 for both the per - protocol and Intent - to - Treat populations , and indicate similarity of Lantus to NPH in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as assessed by this outcome .

However , long - term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy .
• Lipodystrophy Long - term use of insulin , including LANTUS , can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections .
Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy ( thickening of adipose tissue ) and lipoatrophy ( thinning of adipose tissue ) , and may affect insulin absorption .
Rotate insulin injection or infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy .
[ See ] .
Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) • Weight gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy , including LANTUS , and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria .
• Peripheral Edema Insulin , including LANTUS , may cause sodium retention and edema , particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy .
• Allergic Reactions Local Allergy As with any insulin therapy , patients taking LANTUS may experience injection site reactions , including redness , pain , itching , urticaria , edema , and inflammation .
In clinical studies in adult patients , there was a higher incidence of treatment - emergent injection site pain in LANTUS - treated patients ( 2 . 7 % ) compared to NPH insulin - treated patients ( 0 . 7 % ) .
The reports of pain at the injection site did not result in discontinuation of therapy .
Rotation of the injection site within a given area from one injection to the next may help to reduce or prevent these reactions .
In some instances , these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin , such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique .
Most minor reactions to insulin usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
Systemic Allergy Severe , life - threatening , generalized allergy , including anaphylaxis , generalized skin reactions , angioedema , bronchospasm , hypotension , and shock may occur with any insulin , including LANTUS and may be life threatening .
• Antibody production All insulin products can elicit the formation of insulin antibodies .
The presence of such insulin antibodies may increase or decrease the efficacy of insulin and may require adjustment of the insulin dose .
In phase 3 clinical trials of LANTUS , increases in titers of antibodies to insulin were observed in NPH insulin and insulin glargine treatment groups with similar incidences .
• Cardiovascular Safety The Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention trial ( i . e . , ORIGIN ) was an open - label , randomized , 2 - by - 2 , factorial design study .
One intervention in ORIGIN compared the effect of LANTUS to standard care on major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in 12 , 537 participants ≥ 50 years of age with abnormal glucose levels [ i . e . , impaired fasting glucose ( IFG ) and / or impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) ] or early type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular ( i . e . , CV ) disease or CV risk factors at baseline .
The objective of the trial was to demonstrate that LANTUS use could significantly lower the risk of major cardiovascular outcomes compared to standard care .
Two co - primary composite cardiovascular endpoints were used in ORIGIN .
The first co - primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event defined as the composite of CV death , nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke .
The second co - primary endpoint was the time to the first occurrence of CV death or nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke or revascularization procedure or hospitalization for heart failure .
Participants were randomized to either LANTUS ( N = 6264 ) titrated to a goal fasting plasma glucose of ≤ 95 mg / dL or to standard care ( N = 6273 ) .
Anthropometric and disease characteristics were balanced at baseline .
The mean age was 64 years and 8 % of participants were 75 years of age or older .
The majority of participants were male ( 65 % ) .
Fifty nine percent were Caucasian , 25 % were Latin , 10 % were Asian and 3 % were Black .
The median baseline BMI was 29 kg / m .
Approximately 12 % of participants had abnormal glucose levels ( IGT and / or IFG ) at baseline and 88 % had type 2 diabetes .
For patients with type 2 diabetes , 59 % were treated with a single oral antidiabetic drug , 23 % had known diabetes but were on no antidiabetic drug and 6 % were newly diagnosed during the screening procedure .
The mean HbA1c ( SD ) at baseline was 6 . 5 % ( 1 . 0 ) .
Fifty nine percent of participants had had a prior cardiovascular event and 39 % had documented coronary artery disease or other cardiovascular risk factors .
2 Vital status was available for 99 . 9 % and 99 . 8 % of participants randomized to LANTUS and standard care respectively at end of trial .
The median duration of follow - up was 6 . 2 years [ range : 8 days to 7 . 9 years ] .
The mean HbA1c ( SD ) at the end of the trial was 6 . 5 % ( 1 . 1 ) and 6 . 8 % ( 1 . 2 ) in the LANTUS and standard care group respectively .
The median dose of LANTUS at end of trial was 0 . 45 U / kg .
Eighty - one percent of patients randomized to LANTUS were using LANTUS at end of the study .
The mean change in body weight from baseline to the last treatment visit was 2 . 2 kg greater in the LANTUS group than in the standard care group .
Overall , the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular outcomes was similar between groups ( see ) .
All - cause mortality was also similar between groups .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins , particularly short - acting insulins , have been accidentally administered instead of LANTUS ] .
To avoid medication errors between LANTUS and other insulins , patients should be instructed to always verify the insulin label before each injection .
[ See Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) 7 .
DRUG INTERACTIONS A number of drugs affect glucose metabolism and may require insulin dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring .
The following are examples of drugs that may increase the blood - glucose - lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS and , therefore , increase the susceptibility to hypoglycemia : oral anti - diabetic products , pramlintide , angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , disopyramide , fibrates , fluoxetine , monoamine oxidase inhibitors , propoxyphene , pentoxifylline , salicylates , somatostatin analogs , and sulfonamide antibiotics .
The following are examples of drugs that may reduce the blood - glucose - lowering effect of insulins including LANTUS : corticosteroids , niacin , danazol , diuretics , sympathomimetic agents ( e . g . , epinephrine , albuterol , terbutaline ) , glucagon , isoniazid , phenothiazine derivatives , somatropin , thyroid hormones , estrogens , progestogens ( e . g . , in oral contraceptives ) , protease inhibitors and atypical antipsychotic medications ( e . g . olanzapine and clozapine ) .
Beta - blockers , clonidine , lithium salts , and alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the blood - glucose - lowering effect of insulin .
Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia , which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia .
The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking sympatholytic drugs such as beta - blockers , clonidine , guanethidine , and reserpine .
• Certain drugs may affect glucose metabolism , requiring insulin dose adjustment and close monitoring of blood glucose .
( ) 7 • The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking anti - adrenergic drugs ( e . g . , beta - blockers , clonidine , guanethidine , and reserpine ) .

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy category C : Use during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus ( ) 8 . 1 • Pediatric : Has not been studied in children with type 2 diabetes .
Has not been studied in children with type 1 diabetes < 6 years of age ( ) 8 . 4 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C : Subcutaneous reproduction and teratology studies have been performed with insulin glargine and regular human insulin in rats and Himalayan rabbits .
Insulin glargine was given to female rats before mating , during mating , and throughout pregnancy at doses up to 0 . 36 mg / kg / day , which is approximately 7 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dose of 10 Units / day ( 0 . 008 mg / kg / day ) , based on mg / m .
In rabbits , doses of 0 . 072 mg / kg / day , which is approximately 2 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dose of 10 Units / day ( 0 . 008 mg / kg / day ) , based on mg / m , were administered during organogenesis .
The effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin in rats or rabbits .
However , in rabbits , five fetuses from two litters of the high - dose group exhibited dilation of the cerebral ventricles .
Fertility and early embryonic development appeared normal .
22 There are no well - controlled clinical studies of the use of LANTUS in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
It is essential for patients with diabetes or a history of gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control before conception and throughout pregnancy .
Insulin requirements may decrease during the first trimester , generally increase during the second and third trimesters , and rapidly decline after delivery .
Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential in these patients .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is unknown whether insulin glargine is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs , including human insulin , are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when LANTUS is administered to a nursing woman .
Use of LANTUS is compatible with breastfeeding , but women with diabetes who are lactating may require adjustments of their insulin doses .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of subcutaneous injections of LANTUS have been established in pediatric patients ( age 6 to 15 years ) with type 1 diabetes .
LANTUS has not been studied in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age with type 1 diabetes .
LANTUS has not been studied in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes .
[ see ] Clinical Studies ( 14 ) Based on the results of a study in pediatric patients , the dose recommendation when switching to LANTUS is the same as that described for adults and As in adults , the dosage of LANTUS must be individualized in pediatric patients based on metabolic needs and frequent monitoring of blood glucose .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Clinical Studies ( 14 ) 8 . 5 Geriatric Use In controlled clinical studies comparing LANTUS to NPH insulin , 593 of 3890 patients ( 15 % ) with type 1 and type 2 diabetes were ≥ 65 years of age and 80 ( 2 % ) patients were ≥ 75 years of age .
The only difference in safety or effectiveness in the subpopulation of patients ≥ 65 years of age compared to the entire study population was a higher incidence of cardiovascular events typically seen in an older population in both LANTUS and NPH insulin - treated patients .
Nevertheless , caution should be exercised when LANTUS is administered to geriatric patients .
In elderly patients with diabetes , the initial dosing , dose increments , and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemic reactions .
Hypoglycemia may be difficult to recognize in the elderly [ See ] .
Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) 10 .
OVERDOSAGE An excess of insulin relative to food intake , energy expenditure , or both may lead to severe and sometimes prolonged and life - threatening hypoglycemia .
Mild episodes of hypoglycemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates .
Adjustments in drug dosage , meal patterns , or exercise may be needed .
More severe episodes of hypoglycemia with coma , seizure , or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular / subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose .
After apparent clinical recovery from hypoglycemia , continued observation and additional carbohydrate intake may be necessary to avoid recurrence of hypoglycemia .

DESCRIPTION LANTUS ( insulin glargine [ rDNA origin ] injection ) is a sterile solution of insulin glargine for use as a subcutaneous injection .
Insulin glargine is a recombinant human insulin analog that is a long - acting ( up to 24 - hour duration of action ) , parenteral blood - glucose - lowering agent [ ] .
LANTUS is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non - pathogenic laboratory strain of ( K12 ) as the production organism .
Insulin glargine differs from human insulin in that the amino acid asparagine at position A21 is replaced by glycine and two arginines are added to the C - terminus of the B - chain .
Chemically , insulin glargine is 21 - Gly - 30 a - L - Arg - 30 b - L - Arg - human insulin and has the empirical formula C H N O S and a molecular weight of 6063 .
Insulin glargine has the following structural formula : See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) Escherichia coliABB26740472786 [ MULTIMEDIA ] LANTUS consists of insulin glargine dissolved in a clear aqueous fluid .
Each milliliter of LANTUS ( insulin glargine injection ) contains 100 Units ( 3 . 6378 mg ) insulin glargine .
The 10 mL vial presentation contains the following inactive ingredients per mL : 30 mcg zinc , 2 . 7 mg m - cresol , 20 mg glycerol 85 % , 20 mcg polysorbate 20 , and water for injection .
The 3 mL cartridge presentation contains the following inactive ingredients per mL : 30 mcg zinc , 2 . 7 mg m - cresol , 20 mg glycerol 85 % , and water for injection .
The pH is adjusted by addition of aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide .
LANTUS has a pH of approximately 4 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of insulin , including insulin glargine , is regulation of glucose metabolism .
Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake , especially by skeletal muscle and fat , and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production .
Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis , and enhances protein synthesis .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Insulin glargine is a human insulin analog that has been designed to have low aqueous solubility at neutral pH . At pH 4 , as in the LANTUS injection solution , insulin glargine is completely soluble .
After injection into the subcutaneous tissue , the acidic solution is neutralized , leading to formation of microprecipitates from which small amounts of insulin glargine are slowly released , resulting in a relatively constant concentration / time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak .
This profile allows once - daily dosing as a basal insulin .
In clinical studies , the glucose - lowering effect on a molar basis ( i . e . , when given at the same doses ) of intravenous insulin glargine is approximately the same as that for human insulin .
In euglycemic clamp studies in healthy subjects or in patients with type 1 diabetes , the onset of action of subcutaneous insulin glargine was slower than NPH insulin .
The effect profile of insulin glargine was relatively constant with no pronounced peak and the duration of its effect was prolonged compared to NPH insulin .
shows results from a study in patients with type 1 diabetes conducted for a maximum of 24 hours after the injection .
The median time between injection and the end of pharmacological effect was 14 . 5 hours ( range : 9 . 5 to 19 . 3 hours ) for NPH insulin , and 24 hours ( range : 10 . 8 to > 24 . 0 hours ) ( 24 hours was the end of the observation period ) for insulin glargine .

Activity Profile in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes [ MULTIMEDIA ] * Determined as amount of glucose infused to maintain constant plasma glucose levels ( hourly mean values ) ; indicative of insulin activity .
The longer duration of action ( up to 24 hours ) of LANTUS is directly related to its slower rate of absorption and supports once - daily subcutaneous administration .
The time course of action of insulins , including LANTUS , may vary between individuals and within the same individual .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Bioavailability .
After subcutaneous injection of insulin glargine in healthy subjects and in patients with diabetes , the insulin serum concentrations indicated a slower , more prolonged absorption and a relatively constant concentration / time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak in comparison to NPH insulin .
Serum insulin concentrations were thus consistent with the time profile of the pharmacodynamic activity of insulin glargine .
After subcutaneous injection of 0 . 3 Units / kg insulin glargine in patients with type 1 diabetes , a relatively constant concentration / time profile has been demonstrated .
The duration of action after abdominal , deltoid , or thigh subcutaneous administration was similar .
Metabolism .
A metabolism study in humans indicates that insulin glargine is partly metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the B chain in the subcutaneous depot to form two active metabolites with in vitro activity similar to that of insulin , M1 ( 21 - Gly - insulin ) and M2 ( 21 - Gly - des - 30 - Thr - insulin ) .
Unchanged drug and these degradation products are also present in the circulation .
AAB Special Populations Information on the effect of age , race , and gender on the pharmacokinetics of LANTUS is not available .
However , in controlled clinical trials in adults ( n = 3890 ) and a controlled clinical trial in pediatric patients ( n = 349 ) , subgroup analyses based on age , race , and gender did not show differences in safety and efficacy between insulin glargine and NPH insulin .

Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) 13 .
NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In mice and rats , standard two - year carcinogenicity studies with insulin glargine were performed at doses up to 0 . 455 mg / kg , which was for the rat approximately 10 times and for the mouse approximately 5 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dose of 10 Units / day ( 0 . 008 mg / kg / day ) , based on mg / m .
The findings in female mice were not conclusive due to excessive mortality in all dose groups during the study .
Histiocytomas were found at injection sites in male rats ( statistically significant ) and male mice ( not statistically significant ) in acid vehicle containing groups .
These tumors were not found in female animals , in saline control , or insulin comparator groups using a different vehicle .
The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown .
2 Insulin glargine was not mutagenic in tests for detection of gene mutations in bacteria and mammalian cells ( Ames - and HGPRT - test ) and in tests for detection of chromosomal aberrations ( cytogenetics in vitro in V79 cells and in vivo in Chinese hamsters ) .
In a combined fertility and prenatal and postnatal study in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 0 . 36 mg / kg / day , which was approximately 7 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dose of 10 Units / day ( 0 . 008 mg / kg / day ) , based on mg / m , maternal toxicity due to dose - dependent hypoglycemia , including some deaths , was observed .
Consequently , a reduction of the rearing rate occurred in the high - dose group only .
Similar effects were observed with NPH insulin .

CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and effectiveness of LANTUS given once - daily at bedtime was compared to that of once - daily and twice - daily NPH insulin in open - label , randomized , active - controlled , parallel studies of 2 , 327 adult patients and 349 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 1 , 563 adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( see Tables 9 – 11 ) , In general , the reduction in glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) with LANTUS was similar to that with NPH insulin .
The overall rates of hypoglycemia did not differ between patients with diabetes treated with LANTUS compared to NPH insulin .
[ See ] Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ( see ) .
Type 1 Diabetes – AdultTable 11 In two clinical studies ( Studies A and B ) , patients with type 1 diabetes ( Study A ; n = 585 , Study B ; n = 534 ) were randomized to 28 weeks of basal - bolus treatment with LANTUS or NPH insulin .
Regular human insulin was administered before each meal .
LANTUS was administered at bedtime .
NPH insulin was administered once daily at bedtime or in the morning and at bedtime when used twice daily .
In another clinical study ( Study C ) , patients with type 1 diabetes ( n = 619 ) were randomized to 16 weeks of basal - bolus treatment with LANTUS or NPH insulin .
Insulin lispro was used before each meal .
LANTUS was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH insulin was administered once or twice daily .
In these 3 studies , LANTUS and NPH insulin had similar effects on HbA1c ( Table 11 ) with a similar overall rate of hypoglycemia .

Table 12 In a randomized , controlled clinical study ( Study D ) , pediatric patients ( age range 6 to 15 years ) with type 1 diabetes ( n = 349 ) were treated for 28 weeks with a basal - bolus insulin regimen where regular human insulin was used before each meal .
LANTUS was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH insulin was administered once or twice daily .
Similar effects on HbA1c ( Table 12 ) and the incidence of hypoglycemia were observed in both treatment groups .

Table 13 In a randomized , controlled clinical study ( Study E ) ( n = 570 ) , LANTUS was evaluated for 52 weeks in combination with oral anti - diabetic medications ( a sulfonylurea , metformin , acarbose , or combinations of these drugs ) .
LANTUS administered once daily at bedtime was as effective as NPH insulin administered once daily at bedtime in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose ( Table 13 ) .
The rate of hypoglycemia was similar in LANTUS and NPH insulin treated patients .
[ See ] Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) In a randomized , controlled clinical study ( Study F ) , in patients with type 2 diabetes not using oral anti - diabetic medications ( n = 518 ) , a basal - bolus regimen of LANTUS once daily at bedtime or NPH insulin administered once or twice daily was evaluated for 28 weeks .
Regular human insulin was used before meals , as needed .
LANTUS had similar effectiveness as either once - or twice - daily NPH insulin in reducing HbA1c and fasting glucose ( Table 13 ) with a similar incidence of hypoglycemia .
[ See ] Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) In a randomized , controlled clinical study ( Study G ) , patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to 5 years of treatment with once - daily LANTUS or twice - daily NPH insulin .
For patients not previously treated with insulin , the starting dose of LANTUS or NPH insulin was 10 units daily .
Patients who were already treated with NPH insulin either continued on the same total daily NPH insulin dose or started LANTUS at a dose that was 80 % of the total previous NPH insulin dose .
The primary endpoint for this study was a comparison of the progression of diabetic retinopathy by 3 or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) scale .
HbA1c change from baseline was a secondary endpoint .
Similar glycemic control in the 2 treatment groups was desired in order to not confound the interpretation of the retinal data .
Patients or study personnel used an algorithm to adjust the LANTUS and NPH insulin doses to a target fasting plasma glucose ≤ 100 mg / dL .
After the LANTUS or NPH insulin dose was adjusted , other anti - diabetic agents , including pre - meal insulin were to be adjusted or added .
The LANTUS group had a smaller mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c compared to the NPH insulin group , which may be explained by the lower daily basal insulin doses in the LANTUS group ( Table 13 ) .
Both treatment groups had a similar incidence of reported symptomatic hypoglycemia .
The incidences of severe symptomatic hypoglycemia are given in Table 6 .

LANTUS Timing of Daily Dosing ( see ) .
Table 14 The safety and efficacy of LANTUS administered pre - breakfast , pre - dinner , or at bedtime were evaluated in a randomized , controlled clinical study in patients with type 1 diabetes ( study H , n = 378 ) .
Patients were also treated with insulin lispro at mealtime .
LANTUS administered at different times of the day resulted in similar reductions in HbA1c compared to that with bedtime administration ( see ) .
In these patients , data are available from 8 - point home glucose monitoring .
The maximum mean blood glucose was observed just prior to injection of LANTUS regardless of time of administration .
Table 14 In this study , 5 % of patients in the LANTUS - breakfast arm discontinued treatment because of lack of efficacy .
No patients in the other two arms discontinued for this reason .
The safety and efficacy of LANTUS administered pre - breakfast or at bedtime were also evaluated in a randomized , active - controlled clinical study ( Study I , n = 697 ) in patients with type 2 diabetes not adequately controlled on oral anti - diabetic therapy .
All patients in this study also received glimepiride 3 mg daily .
LANTUS given before breakfast was at least as effective in lowering HbA1c as LANTUS given at bedtime or NPH insulin given at bedtime ( see ) .

What is the most important information I should know about LANTUS ?
• Any change of insulin should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision .
Changes in insulin strength , manufacturer , type ( for example : Regular , NPH , analogs ) , species ( beef , pork , beef - pork , human ) or method of manufacture ( recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin ) may need a change in the dose .
This dose change may be needed right away or later on during the first several weeks or months on the new insulin .
Doses of oral anti - diabetic medicines may also need to change , if your insulin is changed .
Do not change the insulin you are using without talking to your healthcare provider .
• Your healthcare provider will tell you how often you should test your blood sugar level , and what to do if it is high or low .

LANTUS What is Diabetes ?
• Your body needs insulin to turn sugar ( glucose ) into energy .
If your body does not make enough insulin , you need to take more insulin so you will not have too much sugar in your blood .
• Insulin injections are important in keeping your diabetes under control .
But the way you live , your diet , careful checking of your blood sugar levels , exercise , and planned physical activity , all work with your insulin to help you control your diabetes .
What is LANTUS ?
• LANTUS ( insulin glargine [ recombinant DNA origin ] ) is a long - acting insulin .
Because LANTUS is made by recombinant DNA technology ( rDNA ) and is chemically different from the insulin made by the human body , it is called an insulin analog .
LANTUS is used to treat patients with diabetes for the control of high blood sugar .
It is used once a day to lower blood sugar .
• LANTUS is a clear , colorless , sterile solution for injection under the skin ( subcutaneously ) .
• The active ingredient in LANTUS is insulin glargine .
The concentration of insulin glargine is 100 units per milliliter ( mL ) , or U - 100 .
LANTUS also contains zinc , metacresol , glycerol , polysorbate 20 and water for injection as inactive ingredients .
Hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust the pH . • You need a prescription to get LANTUS .
Always be sure you receive the right insulin from the pharmacy .
Who should NOT take LANTUS ?
or any of the inactive ingredients in LANTUS .
Check with your healthcare provider if you are not sure .

What are the possible side effects of LANTUS and other insulins ?
Insulins , including LANTUS , can cause hypoglycemia ( low blood sugar ) , hyperglycemia ( high blood sugar ) , allergy , and skin reactions .
Hypoglycemia ( low blood sugar ) : Hypoglycemia is often called an " insulin reaction " or " low blood sugar " .
It may happen when you do not have enough sugar in your blood .
Common causes of hypoglycemia are illness , emotional or physical stress , too much insulin , too little food or missed meals , and too much exercise or activity .
Early warning signs of hypoglycemia may be different , less noticeable or not noticeable at all in some people .
That is why it is important to check your blood sugar as you have been advised by your healthcare provider .
: Hypoglycemia can happen with • This can happen when too much insulin is injected .
Taking too much insulin .
• .

• These conditions include diseases of the adrenal glands , the pituitary , the thyroid gland , the liver , and the kidney .
Medical conditions that can affect your blood sugar levels or insulin .
• This can happen if you exercise too much or have a fever .
Too much glucose use by the body .
• Injecting insulin the wrong way or in the wrong injection area .
Hypoglycemia can be mild to severe .
Its onset may be rapid .
Some patients have few or no warning symptoms , including : • patients with diabetes for a long time • patients with diabetic neuropathy ( nerve problems ) • or patients using certain medicines for high blood pressure or heart problems .
Hypoglycemia may reduce your ability to drive a car or use mechanical equipment and you may risk injury to yourself or others .

Mild to moderate hypoglycemia is treated by eating or drinking carbohydrates , such as fruit juice , raisins , sugar candies , milk or glucose tablets .
Talk to your healthcare provider about the amount of carbohydrates you should eat to treat mild to moderate hypoglycemia .
Severe hypoglycemia may require the help of another person or emergency medical people .
A person with hypoglycemia who is unable to take foods or liquids with sugar by mouth , or is unconscious needs medical help fast and will need treatment with a glucagon injection or glucose given intravenously ( IV ) .
Without medical help right away , serious reactions or even death could happen .
Hyperglycemia ( high blood sugar ) : Hyperglycemia happens when you have too much sugar in your blood .
