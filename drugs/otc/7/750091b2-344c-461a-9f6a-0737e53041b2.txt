NONELECTROLYTIC IRRIGATING FLUID FOR TRANSURETHRAL SURGICAL PROCEDURES For Urologic Irrigation Only ; Not For Injection By Usual Parenteral Routes .
Flexible Irrigation Container Rx only DESCRIPTION Sorbitol - Mannitol Irrigation is a sterile , nonpyrogenic , hypotonic , aqueous solution for urologic nonelectrolyte irrigation during transurethral surgical procedures .
Each 100 mL contains sorbitol 2 . 70 g and mannitol 0 . 54 g in water for injection .
The solution is nonelectrolytic and hypotonic ( 178 mOsmol / liter calc . )
; pH 5 . 2 ( 4 . 0 to 7 . 0 ) .
The solution contains no bacteriostat , antimicrobial agent or added buffer and is intended only for use as a single - dose irrigation .
When smaller volumes are required the unused portion should be discarded .
Sorbitol - Mannitol Irrigation is a nonelectrolyte urologic irrigant .
Sorbitol , NF is chemically designated D - glucitol ( C6H14O6 ) , white powder , granules or flakes very soluble in water .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Mannitol , USP is chemically designated D - mannitol ( C6H14O6 ) , white crystalline powder or free - flowing granules , freely soluble in water .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Water for Injection , USP is chemically designated H20 .
The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinylchloride .
Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly .
The semi - rigid container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyolefin .
It is a copolymer of ethylene and propylene .
The container requires no vapor barrier to maintain the proper drug concentration .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts ; however , biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials .
Exposure to temperatures above 25 ° C / 77 ° F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content .
Higher temperatures lead to greater losses .
It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Sorbitol and mannitol are hexitols and are nonelectrolytes .
A solution of these constituents in water is therefore nonconductive and suitable for urologic irrigation during electrosurgical procedures .
A 3 % ( approx . )
total concentration of sorbitol - mannitol contains sufficient solute to minimize the risk of intravascular hemolysis which can occur from absorption of plain water through open prostatic veins during transurethral resection ( TUR ) .
Any solution that is absorbed intravascularly during transurethral prostatic or bladder surgery , although variable in amount depending primarily on the extent of surgery , will be excreted by the kidney .
When absorbed intravascularly , sorbitol and mannitol act as osmotic diuretics .
Intravascular absorption of sorbitol has been shown to produce elevations of serum lactate after TUR above preoperative values owing to sorbitol ' s favored metabolism to lactate from pyruvate .
Increased lactate levels were not sufficient to produce evidence of metabolic acidosis .
Mannitol is only slightly metabolized and rapidly excreted by the kidney .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sorbitol - Mannitol Irrigation is indicated for use as a urologic irrigating fluid during transurethral prostatic resection and other transurethral surgical procedures .
CONTRAINDICATIONS NOT FOR INJECTION BY USUAL PARENTERAL ROUTES .
Do not use in patients with anuria .
WARNINGS FOR UROLOGIC IRRIGATION ONLY .
Solutions for urologic irrigation must be used with caution in patients with severe cardiopulmonary or renal dysfunction .
Irrigating fluids used during transurethral prostatectomy have been demonstrated to enter the systemic circulation in relatively large volumes ; thus , sorbitol - mannitol irrigant must be regarded as a systemic drug .
Absorption of large amounts of fluids containing sorbitol - mannitol and the osmotic diuresis it produces may significantly alter cardiopulmonary and renal dynamics .
Hyperglycemia from metabolism of sorbitol may occur in patients with diabetes mellitus .
Hyperlactatemia from metabolism of sorbitol may potentially produce a significant lactic acidemia in metabolically compromised patients .
The contents of an opened container should be used promptly to minimize the possibility of bacterial growth or pyrogen formation .
Discard the unused portion of irrigation solution since it contains no preservatives .
Do not heat over 66 ° C ( 150 ° F ) .
PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular status , especially of the patient with cardiac disease , should be carefully observed before and during transurethral resection of the prostate when using Sorbitol - Mannitol Irrigation , because the quantity of fluid absorbed into the systemic circulation by opened prostatic veins may produce significant expansion of the extracellular fluid and lead to fulminating congestive heart failure .
Shift of sodium - free intracellular fluid into the extracellular compartment following systemic absorption of solution may lower serum sodium concentration and aggravate pre - existing hyponatremia .
Excessive loss of water and electrolytes may lead to serious imbalances .
With continuous irrigation , loss of water may occur in excess of electrolytes , producing hypernatremia .
Sustained diuresis that results from transurethral irrigation with Sorbitol - Mannitol Irrigation may obscure and intensify inadequate hydration or hypovolemia .
Aseptic technique is essential for the use of sterile solutions for irrigation .
The administration set should be attached promptly .
Unused portions should be discarded and a fresh container of appropriate size used for the start - up of each cycle or repeat procedure .
Do not administer unless solution is clear , seal is intact and container is undamaged .
Discard unused portion .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Studies with Sorbitol - Mannitol Irrigation have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , mutagenic potential , or effects on fertility .
Nursing Mothers : Caution should be exercised when Sorbitol - Mannitol Irrigation is administered to a nursing woman .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects .
Pregnancy Category C . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Sorbitol - Mannitol Irrigation .
It is also not known whether Sorbitol - Mannitol Irrigation can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Sorbitol - Mannitol Irrigation should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Pediatric Use : The safety and effectiveness of Sorbitol - Mannitol Irrigation have not been established .
Its limited use in pediatric patients has been inadequate to fully define proper dosage and limitations for use .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions may result from intravascular absorption of sorbitol and mannitol .
The literature reports occasional adverse reactions from intravenous sorbitol - mannitol infusions .
Consequences of absorption of urologic irrigating solutions include fluid and electrolyte disturbances such as acidosis , electrolyte loss , marked diuresis , urinary retention , edema , dryness of mouth , thirst and dehydration ; cardiovascular disorders such as hypotension , tachycardia , angina - like pains ; pulmonary disorders such as pulmonary congestion ; and other general reactions such as blurred vision , convulsions , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , rhinitis , chills , vertigo , backache and urticaria .
Allergic reactions from sorbitol - mannitol have also been reported .
Should any adverse reaction occur , discontinue the irrigant , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of dehydration , fluid or solute overload , discontinue the irrigation , evaluate the patient and institute corrective measures as indicated .
( See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS . )
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Sorbitol - Mannitol Irrigation should be administered only by transurethral instillation with appropriate urologic instrumentation .
A disposable administration set should be used .
The total volume of solution used for irrigation is solely at the discretion of the surgeon .
Height of container ( s ) above the operating table in excess of 60 cm ( approx .
2 ft ) has been reported to increase intravascular absorption of the irrigating fluid .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever container and solution permit .
