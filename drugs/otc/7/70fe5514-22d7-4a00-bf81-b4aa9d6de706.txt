Patients randomized to Gemcitabine for Injection with cisplatin received a median of 4 cycles of treatment and those randomized to cisplatin alone received a median of 2 cycles of treatment .
In this trial , the requirement for dose adjustments ( > 90 % versus 16 % ) , discontinuation of treatment for adverse reactions ( 15 % versus 8 % ) , and the proportion of patients hospitalized ( 36 % versus 23 % ) were all higher for patients receiving Gemcitabine for Injection with cisplatin compared to those receiving cisplatin alone .
The incidence of febrile neutropenia ( 3 % versus < 1 % ) , sepsis ( 4 % versus 1 % ) , Grade 3 cardiac dysrhythmias ( 3 % versus < 1 % ) were all higher in the Gemcitabine for Injection with cisplatin arm compared to the cisplatin alone arm .
The two - drug combination was more myelosuppressive with 4 ( 1 . 5 % ) possibly treatment - related deaths , including 3 resulting from myelosuppression with infection and one case of renal failure associated with pancytopenia and infection .
No deaths due to treatment were reported on the cisplatin arm .

• Blood and lymphatic system : Thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) • Cardiovascular : Congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction , arrhythmias , supraventricular arrhythmias • Vascular : Peripheral vasculitis , gangrene , capillary leak syndrome • Skin : Cellulitis , pseudocellulitis , severe skin reactions , including desquamation and bullous skin eruptions • Hepatic : Hepatic failure , hepatic veno - occlusive disease • Pulmonary : Interstitial pneumonitis , pulmonary fibrosis , pulmonary edema , adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , pulmonary eosinophilia • Nervous System : Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( PRES ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal data and its mechanism of action , Gemcitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data on the use of Gemcitabine for Injection in pregnant women .
In animal reproduction studies , gemcitabine was teratogenic , embryotoxic , and fetotoxic in mice and rabbits ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus [ see Use in Special Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % respectively .
Data Animal Data Gemcitabine is embryotoxic in mice .
Daily dosing of gemcitabine to pregnant mice increased the incidence of fetal malformation ( cleft palate , incomplete ossification ) at doses of 1 . 5 mg / kg / day [ approximately 0 . 005 times the 1000 mg / m2 clinical dose based on body surface area ( BSA ) ] .
Gemcitabine was embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rabbits .
Daily dosing of gemcitabine to pregnant rabbits resulted in fetotoxicity ( decreased fetal viability , reduced litter sizes , and developmental delays ) and increased the incidence of fetal malformations ( fused pulmonary artery , absence of gall bladder ) at doses of 0 . 1 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 002 times the 1000 mg / m2 clinical dose based on BSA ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of Gemcitabine for Injection or its metabolites in human milk , or their effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production .
Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from Gemcitabine for Injection , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Gemcitabine for Injection and for at least one week following the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Gemcitabine for Injection [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception Gemcitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Females Because of the potential for genotoxicity , advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Gemcitabine for Injection and for 6 months after the final dose of Gemcitabine for Injection .
Males Because of the potential for genotoxicity , advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Gemcitabine for Injection and for 3 months after the final dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Males Based on animal studies , Gemcitabine for Injection may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Gemcitabine for Injection have not been established in pediatric patients .
The safety and pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine were evaluated in a trial in pediatric patients with refractory leukemia .
The maximum tolerated dose was 10 mg / m2 / min for 360 minutes weekly for three weeks followed by a one - week rest period .
The safety and activity of Gemcitabine for Injection were evaluated in a trial of pediatric patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( 22 patients ) and acute myelogenous leukemia ( 10 patients ) at a dose of 10 mg / m2 / min administered over 360 minutes weekly for three weeks followed by a one - week rest period .
Patients with M1 or M2 bone marrow on Day 28 who did not experience unacceptable toxicity were eligible to receive a maximum of one additional four - week course .
Toxicities observed included myelosuppression , febrile neutropenia , increased serum transaminases , nausea , and rash / desquamation .
No meaningful clinical activity was observed in this trial .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In clinical studies which enrolled 979 patients with various malignancies who received single agent Gemcitabine for Injection , no overall differences in safety were observed between patients aged 65 and older and younger patients , with the exception of a higher rate of Grade 3 - 4 thrombocytopenia in older patients as compared to younger patients .
In a randomized trial in women with ovarian cancer ( Study 1 ) , 175 women received Gemcitabine for Injection with carboplatin , of which 29 % were age 65 years or older .
Similar effectiveness was observed between older and younger women .
There was significantly higher Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia in women 65 years of age or older [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Gemcitabine for Injection clearance is affected by age ; however , there are no recommended dose adjustments based on patients ' age [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Gender Gemcitabine for Injection clearance is decreased in females [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In single agent studies of Gemcitabine for Injection , women , especially older women , were more likely not to proceed to a subsequent cycle and to experience Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 , 2 . 4 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known antidote for overdoses of gemcitabine .
Myelosuppression , paresthesias , and severe rash were the principal toxicities seen when a single dose as high as 5700 mg / m2 was administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks to several patients in a dose - escalation study .
In the event of suspected overdose , monitor with appropriate blood counts and provide supportive therapy , as necessary .
11 DESCRIPTION Gemcitabine is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor .
Gemcitabine hydrochloride is 2 ' - deoxy - 2 ' , 2 ' - difluorocytidine monohydrochloride ( β - isomer ) with the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The empirical formula for gemcitabine hydrochloride is C9H11F2N3O4 • HCl .
It has a molecular weight of 299 . 66 g / mol .
Gemcitabine hydrochloride is soluble in water , slightly soluble in methanol , and practically insoluble in ethanol and polar organic solvents .
Gemcitabine for Injection , USP is a sterile white to off - white lyophilized powder and available as 200 mg and 1 gram single - dose vials for intravenous use only .
Each 200 mg vial contains 200 mg gemcitabine ( equivalent to 227 . 7 mg gemcitabine hydrochloride ) , 200 mg mannitol and 12 . 5 mg sodium acetate .
Each 1 gram vial contains 1 gram gemcitabine ( equivalent to 1 . 139 gram gemcitabine hydrochloride ) , 1 gram mannitol , and 62 . 5 mg sodium acetate .
Hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide may have been added for pH adjustment .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Gemcitabine kills cells undergoing DNA synthesis and blocks the progression of cells through the G1 / S - phase boundary .
Gemcitabine is metabolized by nucleoside kinases to diphosphate ( dFdCDP ) and triphosphate ( dFdCTP ) nucleosides .
Gemcitabine diphosphate inhibits ribonucleotide reductase , an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the reactions that generate deoxynucleoside triphosphates for DNA synthesis , resulting in reductions in deoxynucleotide concentrations , including dCTP .
Gemcitabine triphosphate competes with dCTP for incorporation into DNA .
The reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP by the action of the diphosphate enhances the incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate into DNA ( self - potentiation ) .
After the gemcitabine nucleotide is incorporated into DNA , only one additional nucleotide is added to the growing DNA strands , which eventually results in the initiation of apoptotic cell death .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine were examined in 353 patients with various solid tumors .
Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived using data from patients treated for varying durations of therapy given weekly with periodic rest weeks and using both short infusions ( < 70 minutes ) and long infusions ( 70 to 285 minutes ) .
The total Gemcitabine for Injection dose varied from 500 mg / m2 to 3600 mg / m2 .
Distribution The volume of distribution was increased with infusion length .
Volume of distribution of gemcitabine was 50 L / m2 following infusions lasting < 70 minutes .
For long infusions , the volume of distribution rose to 370 L / m2 .
Gemcitabine pharmacokinetics are linear and are described by a 2 - compartment model .
Population pharmacokinetic analyses of combined single and multiple dose studies showed that the volume of distribution of gemcitabine was significantly influenced by duration of infusion and sex .
Gemcitabine plasma protein binding is negligible .
Elimination Metabolism The active metabolite , gemcitabine triphosphate , can be extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
The half - life of the terminal phase for gemcitabine triphosphate from mononuclear cells ranges from 1 . 7 to 19 . 4 hours .
Excretion Gemcitabine disposition was studied in 5 patients who received a single 1000 mg / m2 of radiolabeled drug as a 30 - minute infusion .
Within one week , 92 % to 98 % of the dose was recovered , almost entirely in the urine .
Gemcitabine ( < 10 % ) and the inactive uracil metabolite , 2 ′ - deoxy - 2 ′ , 2 ′ - difluorouridine ( dFdU ) accounted for 99 % of the excreted dose .
The metabolite dFdU is also found in plasma .
Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Clearance of gemcitabine was affected by age .
The lower clearance in geriatric patients results in higher concentrations of gemcitabine for any given dose .
Differences in either clearance or volume of distribution based on patient characteristics or the duration of infusion result in changes in half - life and plasma concentrations .
Table 15 shows plasma clearance and half - life of gemcitabine following short infusions for typical patients by age and sex .
Table 15 : Gemcitabine Clearance and Half - Life for the “ Typical ” Patient a Half - life for patients receiving a < 70 minute infusion .
Age Clearance Men ( L / hr / m2 ) Clearance Women ( L / hr / m2 ) Half - Lifea Men ( min ) Half - Lifea Women ( min ) 29 92 . 2 69 . 4 42 49 45 75 . 7 57 . 0 48 57 65 55 . 1 41 . 5 61 73 79 40 . 7 30 . 7 79 94 Gemcitabine half - life for short infusions ranged from 42 to 94 minutes and for long infusions varied from 245 to 638 minutes , depending on age and sex , reflecting a greatly increased volume of distribution with longer infusions .
Male and Female Patients Females have lower clearance and longer half - lives than male patients as described in Table 15 .
Patients with Renal Impairment No clinical studies have been conducted with gemcitabine in patients with decreased renal function .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinical studies have been conducted with gemcitabine in patients with decreased hepatic function .
Drug Interaction Studies When Gemcitabine for Injection ( 1250 mg / m2 on Days 1 and 8 ) and cisplatin ( 75 mg / m2 on Day 1 ) were administered in patients with NSCLC , the clearance of gemcitabine on Day 1 was 128 L / hr / m2 and on Day 8 was 107 L / hr / m2 .
Data from patients with NSCLC demonstrate that Gemcitabine for Injection and carboplatin given in combination does not alter the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine or carboplatin compared to administration of either single agent ; however , due to wide confidence intervals and small sample size , interpatient variability may be observed .
Data from metastatic breast cancer patients shows that Gemcitabine for Injection has little or no effect on the pharmacokinetics ( clearance and half - life ) of paclitaxel and paclitaxel has little or no effect on the pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Gemcitabine for Injection have not been conducted .
Gemcitabine was mutagenic in an in vitro mouse lymphoma ( L5178Y ) assay and was clastogenic in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
Gemcitabine intraperitoneal doses of 0 . 5 mg / kg / day [ about 1 / 700 the 1000 mg / m2 clinical dose based on body surface area ( BSA ) ] in male mice resulted in moderate to severe hypospermatogenesis , decreased fertility , and decreased implantations .
In female mice , fertility was not affected but maternal toxicities were observed at 1 . 5 mg / kg / day administered intravenously ( about 1 / 200 the 1000 mg / m2 clinical dose based on BSA ) and fetotoxicity or embryolethality was observed at 0 . 25 mg / kg / day administered intravenously ( about 1 / 1300 the 1000 mg / m2 clinical dose based on BSA ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Ovarian Cancer The efficacy of Gemcitabine for Injection was evaluated in a randomized trial ( Study 1 ) conducted in women with advanced ovarian cancer that had relapsed at least 6 months after first - line platinum - based therapy .
Patients were randomized to receive either Gemcitabine for Injection 1000 mg / m2 on Days 1 and 8 of each 21 - day cycle with carboplatin AUC 4 on Day 1 after Gemcitabine for Injection administration ( n = 178 ) or carboplatin AUC 5 on Day 1 of each 21 - day cycle ( n = 178 ) .
The major efficacy outcome measure was progression - free survival ( PFS ) .
A total of 356 patients were enrolled .
Demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in Table 16 .
Efficacy results are presented in Table 17 and Figure 1 .
The addition of Gemcitabine for Injection to carboplatin resulted in statistically significant improvements in PFS and overall response rate .
Approximately 75 % of patients in each arm received additional chemotherapy for disease progression ; 13 of 120 patients in the carboplatin alone arm received Gemcitabine for Injection for treatment of disease progression .
There was no significant difference in overall survival between the treatment arms .

Patients were randomized to receive either Gemcitabine for Injection 1250 mg / m2 on Days 1 and 8 of each 21 - day cycle with paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 administered on Day 1 before Gemcitabine for Injection administration ( n = 267 ) or paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 on Day 1 of each 21 - day cycle ( n = 262 ) .
The major efficacy outcome measure was time to documented disease progression .
A total of 529 patients were enrolled .
Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar between treatment arms ( Table 18 ) .
Efficacy results are presented in Table 19 and Figure 2 .
The addition of Gemcitabine for Injection to paclitaxel resulted in statistically significant improvement in time to documented disease progression and overall response rate compared to paclitaxel alone .

Demographics and baseline characteristics ( Table 20 ) were similar between arms with the exception of histologic subtype of NSCLC , with 48 % of patients on the cisplatin arm and 37 % of patients on the Gemcitabine for Injection with cisplatin arm having adenocarcinoma .
Efficacy results are presented in Table 21 and Figure 3 .
Study 4 : 21 - Day Schedule A randomized ( 1 : 1 ) , multicenter trial ( Study 4 ) was conducted in patients with Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC .
Patients were randomized to receive either Gemcitabine for Injection 1250 mg / m2 on Days 1 and 8 of each 21 - day cycle with cisplatin 100 mg / m2 on Day 1 after Gemcitabine for Injection administration or etoposide 100 mg / m2 intravenously on Days 1 , 2 , and 3 with cisplatin 100 mg / m2 on Day 1 of each 21 - day cycle .
The major efficacy outcome measure was response rate .
A total of 135 patients were enrolled .
Demographics and baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 20 .
Efficacy results are presented in Table 21 .
There was no significant difference in survival between the two treatment arms .
The median survival was 8 . 7 months for the Gemcitabine for Injection with cisplatin arm versus 7 months for the etoposide with cisplatin arm .
Median time to disease progression for the Gemcitabine for Injection with cisplatin arm was 5 months compared to 4 . 1 months on the etoposide with cisplatin arm ( Log rank p = 0 . 015 , two - sided ) .
The objective response rate for the Gemcitabine for Injection with cisplatin arm was 33 % compared to 14 % on the etoposide with cisplatin arm ( Fisher ' s Exact p = 0 . 01 , two - sided ) .

In Study 5 , patients were randomized to receive either Gemcitabine for Injection 1000 mg / m2 intravenously over 30 minutes once weekly for 7 weeks followed by a one - week rest , then once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks every 28 - days in subsequent cycles ( n = 63 ) or fluorouracil 600 mg / m2 intravenously over 30 minutes once weekly ( n = 63 ) .
In Study 6 , all patients received Gemcitabine for Injection 1000 mg / m2 intravenously over 30 minutes once weekly for 7 weeks followed by a one - week rest , then once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks every 28 - days in subsequent cycles .
The major efficacy outcome measure in both trials was " clinical benefit response " .
A patient was considered to have had a clinical benefit response if either of the following occurred : • The patient achieved a ≥ 50 % reduction in pain intensity ( Memorial Pain Assessment Card ) or analgesic consumption , or a 20 - point or greater improvement in performance status ( Karnofsky Performance Status ) for a period of at least 4 consecutive weeks , without showing any sustained worsening in any of the other parameters .
Sustained worsening was defined as 4 consecutive weeks with either any increase in pain intensity or analgesic consumption or a 20 - point decrease in performance status occurring during the first 12 weeks of therapy .
OR • The patient was stable on all of the aforementioned parameters and showed a marked , sustained weight gain ( ≥ 7 % increase maintained for ≥ 4 weeks ) not due to fluid accumulation .
Study 5 enrolled 126 patients .
Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar between the arms ( Table 22 ) .
The efficacy results are shown in Table 23 and Figure 4 .
Patients treated with Gemcitabine for Injection had statistically significant increases in clinical benefit response , survival , and time to disease progression compared to those randomized to receive fluorouracil .
No confirmed objective tumor responses were observed in either treatment arm .
