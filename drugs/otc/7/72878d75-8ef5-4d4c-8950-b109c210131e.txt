ANTICOAGULANT SODIUM CITRATE CONCENTRATE – 46 . 7 % Trisodium Citrate PN 6030 , 30 mL NDC 23731 - 6030 - 3 DESCRIPTION triCitrasol ® Anticoagulant Sodium Citrate Concentrate , 46 . 7 % Trisodium Citrate , is a sterile , non - pyrogenic solution of Trisodium Citrate ( Dihydrate ) , USP .
Each 30 mL of concentrate contains : Trisodium Citrate , dihydrate , USP 14 . 0 grams Water for Injection , USP q . s . pH adjusted with Citric Acid pH : 6 . 3 – 6 . 6 [ MULTIMEDIA ] Single patient use only , on a single occasion .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY A sodium citrate solution acts as an anticoagulant by the action of the citrate ion chelating free ionized calcium ; thus , the calcium ion is unavailable to the coagulation system 1 .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE triCitrasol ® Anticoagulant Sodium Citrate Concentrate , 46 . 7 % Trisodium Citrate , is an anticoagulant used in granulocytapheresis procedures ( granulocyte collection by apheresis ) .
Just prior to performing granulocytapheresis , aseptically add 30 mL of triCitrasol ® to 500 mL of the 6 % solution of Hydroxyethyl Starch ( HES ) , e . g . Hespan ® 2 - 8 .
Agitate the resultant solution for 1 minute to assure a uniform concentration of anticoagulant .
The resultant solution of triCitrasol ® and 6 % solution of HES contains the following concentration depending upon the volume used : Volume of triCitrasol ® Volume of HES Total Volume Final Concentration of triCitrasol ® 30 mL 500 mL ( measured from HES bag ) 530 mL 2 . 6 % 30 mL 558 mL ( injected directly into HES bag ) 588 mL 2 . 4 % The triCitrasol ® / HES solution is stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature after mixing .
Refer to the manufacturer ' s Operator ' s Manual of the apheresis medical device for the directions to perform the granulocytapheresis procedure .
CONTRAINDICATIONS NOT FOR DIRECT INTRAVENOUS INFUSION .
WARNINGS CONCENTRATED ANTICOAGULANT – DILUTE PRIOR TO USE .
PRECAUTIONS General Aseptic technique must be maintained at all times .
triCitrasol ® Anticoagulant Sodium Citrate Concentrate is a clear / colorless solution .
If the product shows any cloudiness or turbidity , the concentrate should be discarded .
The cap / stopper system provides a biological barrier and should be intact – discard product if system is comprised .
Information for Patients None .
Laboratory Tests There are no laboratory tests for the drug product at this time .

ADVERSE REACTIONS Citrate reactions or toxicity may occur with the infusion of blood products containing citrate anticoagulant 1 .
9 11 .
The recipient of the citrated blood product should be monitored for the signs and symptoms of citrate toxicity 1 .
9 11 .
The signs and symptoms of citrate toxicity begin with paresthesia , a " tingling " sensation around the mouth or in the extremities , followed by severe reactions that are characterized by chills , stomach cramps , or pressure in the chest , followed by more severe reactions that are characterized by hypotension and possible cardiac arrhythmia 1 .
9 11 .
Citrate toxicity may occur more frequently in patients that are hypothermic 10 , have impaired liver or renal function 10 , or have low calcium levels because of an underlying disease 9 .
OVERDOSAGE Since the bottle of triCitrasol ® contains only 30 mL of the product , it is impossible to overdose the addition of the product to the 6 % solution of HES .
However , in the event of a reaction to the infusion of citrated blood products , evaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective actions 1 , 9 .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The apheresis system will control the amount of the citrate / 6 % solution of HES that is added to the whole blood and the method of administration of the solution .
Refer to the Operator ' s Manual of the apheresis medical device .
