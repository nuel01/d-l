Rx Only For Dermatologic Use Only Not for Ophthalmic Use DESCRIPTION Luxíq Foam contains betamethasone valerate , USP , a synthetic corticosteroid , for topical dermatologic use .
The corticosteroids constitute a class of primarily synthetic steroids used topically as anti - inflammatory agents .
Betamethasone valerate is 9 - fluoro11ß , 17 , 21 - trihydroxy - 16ß - methylpregna - 1 , 4 - diene - 3 , 20 - dione 17 - valerate , with the empirical formula C27H37FO6 , a molecular weight of 476 . 58 .
The following is the chemical structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Betamethasone valerate is a white to practically white , odorless crystalline powder , and is practically insoluble in water , freely soluble in acetone and in chloroform , soluble in alcohol , and slightly soluble in benzene and in ether .
Luxíq ® ( betamethasone valerate ) Foam , 0 . 12 % , contains 1 . 2 mg betamethasone valerate , USP , per gram in a thermolabile hydroethanolic foam vehicle consisting of cetyl alcohol , citric acid , ethanol ( 60 . 4 % ) , polysorbate 60 , potassium citrate , propylene glycol , purified water , and stearyl alcohol pressurized with a hydrocarbon ( propane / butane ) propellant .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Like other topical corticosteroids , betamethasone valerate foam has anti - inflammatory , antipruritic , and vasoconstrictive properties .
The mechanism of the anti - inflammatory activity of the topical steroids , in general , is unclear .
However , corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins , collectively called lipocortins .
It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid .
Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 .
Pharmacokinetics Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from intact healthy skin .
The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors , including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier .
Occlusion , inflammation and / or other disease processes in the skin may also increase percutaneous absorption .
The use of pharmacodynamic endpoints for assessing the systemic exposure of topical corticosteroids is necessary due to the fact that circulating levels are well below the level of detection .
Once absorbed through the skin , topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids .
They are metabolized , primarily in the liver , and are then excreted by the kidneys .
In addition , some corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted in the bile .
CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of Luxíq has been demonstrated in a four - week trial .
An adequate and well - controlled clinical trial was conducted in 190 patients with moderate to severe scalp psoriasis .
Patients were treated twice daily for four weeks with Luxíq Foam , Placebo foam , a commercially available betamethasone valerate lotion 0 . 12 % ( formerly expressed as 0 . 1 % betamethasone ) , or Placebo lotion .
At four weeks of treatment , study results of 159 patients demonstrated that the efficacy of Luxíq Foam in treating scalp psoriasis is superior to that of Placebo foam , and is comparable to that of a currently marketed BMV lotion ( see Table below ) .
Subjects with Target Lesion Parameter Clear at Endpoint Luxíq Foam n ( % ) BMV lotion n ( % ) Placebo foam n ( % ) Scaling 30 ( 47 % ) 22 ( 35 % ) 2 ( 6 % ) Erythema 26 ( 41 % ) 16 ( 25 % ) 2 ( 6 % ) Plaque Thickness 42 ( 66 % ) 25 ( 40 % ) 5 ( 16 % ) Investigator ' s Global : Subjects Completely Clear or Almost Clear at Endpoint 43 ( 67 % ) 29 ( 46 % ) 6 ( 19 % ) INDICATIONS AND USAGE Luxíq is a medium potency topical corticosteroid indicated for relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid - responsive dermatoses of the scalp .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Luxíq is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to betamethasone valerate , to other corticosteroids , or to any ingredient in this preparation .
PRECAUTIONS General Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has caused reversible hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment .
Manifestations of Cushing ’ s syndrome , hyperglycemia , and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment .
Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids , use over large surface areas , prolonged use , and the addition of occlusive dressings .
Therefore , patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression .
If HPA axis suppression is noted , an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug , to reduce the frequency of application , or to substitute a less potent steroid .
Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids .
Infrequently , signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids .
For information on systemic supplementation , see prescribing information for those products .
Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios .
( See PRECAUTIONS - Pediatric Use . )
If irritation develops , Luxíq should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted .
Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation , as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids .
Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing .
In the presence of dermatological infections , the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted .
If a favorable response does not occur promptly , use of Luxíq should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled .
Information for Patients Patients using topical corticosteroids should receive the following information and instructions : • This medication is to be used as directed by the physician .
It is for external use only .
Avoid contact with the eyes .
• This medication should not be used for any disorder other than that for which it was prescribed .
• The treated scalp area should not be bandaged or otherwise covered or wrapped so as to be occlusive unless directed by the physician .
• Patients should report to their physician any signs of local adverse reactions .
• As with other corticosteroids , therapy should be discontinued when control is achieved .
If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks , contact the physician .
Laboratory Tests The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression : ACTH stimulation test A . M . plasma cortisol test Urinary free cortisol test Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , and Impairment of Fertility Long - term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of betamethasone valerate .
Betamethasone was genotoxic in the in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay with metabolic activation and in the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay .
Pregnancy Category C Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels .
Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Therefore , Luxíq should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients , in large amounts , or for prolonged periods of time .
Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth , interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production , or cause other untoward effects .
It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when Luxíq is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass , pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression and Cushing ’ s syndrome when they are treated with topical corticosteroids .
They are therefore also at greater risk of adrenal insufficiency during and / or after withdrawal of treatment .
Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children .
Hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis suppression , Cushing ’ s syndrome , linear growth retardation , delayed weight gain , and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids .
Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include low plasma cortisol levels and an absence of response to ACTH stimulation .
Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles , headaches , and bilateral papilledema .
Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen .
Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children .
ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequent adverse event was burning / itching / stinging at the application site ; the incidence and severity of this event were as follows : Incidence and severity of burning / itching / stinging Maximum severity Product Total incidence Mild Moderate Severe Luxíq Foam n = 63 34 ( 54 % ) 28 ( 44 % ) 5 ( 8 % ) 1 ( 2 % ) Betamethasone valerate lotion n = 63 33 ( 52 % ) 26 ( 41 % ) 6 ( 10 % ) 1 ( 2 % ) Placebo Foam n = 32 24 ( 75 % ) 13 ( 41 % ) 7 ( 22 % ) 4 ( 12 % ) Placebo Lotion n = 30 20 ( 67 % ) 12 ( 40 % ) 5 ( 17 % ) 3 ( 10 % ) Other adverse events which were considered to be possibly , probably , or definitely related to Luxíq occurred in 1 patient each ; these were paresthesia , pruritus , acne , alopecia , and conjunctivitis .
The following additional local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids , and they may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings .
These reactions are listed in an approximately decreasing order of occurrence : irritation ; dryness ; folliculitis ; acneiform eruptions ; hypopigmentation ; perioral dermatitis ; allergic contact dermatitis ; secondary infection ; skin atrophy ; striae ; and miliaria .
Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids has produced reversible hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis suppression , manifestations of Cushing ’ s syndrome , hyperglycemia , and glucosuria in some patients .
