The discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 4 . 4 % with oxybutynin ER compared to 0 % with oxybutynin IR .
The most frequent adverse reaction causing discontinuation of study medication was dry mouth ( 0 . 7 % ) .
The following adverse reactions were reported by < 1 % of oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets - treated patients and at a higher incidence than placebo in clinical trials : Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders : anorexia , fluid retention ; Vascular disorders : hot flush ; Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders : dysphonia ; Gastrointestinal Disorders : dysphagia , frequent bowel movements ; General disorders and administration site conditions : chest discomfort , thirst .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets .
Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Infections and Infestations : Urinary tract infection ; Psychiatric Disorders : psychotic disorder , agitation , confusional state , hallucinations , memory impairment , abnormal behavior ; Nervous System Disorders : convulsions ; Eye Disorders : glaucoma ; Respiratory , Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders : nasal congestion ; Cardiac Disorders : arrhythmia , tachycardia , palpitations , QT interval prolongation ; Vascular Disorders : flushing , hypertension ; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : rash ; Renal and Urinary Disorders : impotence ; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : hypersensitivity reactions , including angioedema with airway obstruction , urticaria , and face edema ; anaphylactic reactions requiring hospitalization for emergency treatment ; Injury , poisoning and procedural complications : fall .
Additional adverse events reported with some other oxybutynin chloride formulations include : cycloplegia , mydriasis , and suppression of lactation .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth , constipation , somnolence ( drowsiness ) , and / or other anticholinergic - like effects may increase the frequency and / or severity of such effects .
Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility .
This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index .
Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents , such as metoclopramide .
Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablet was administered with ketoconazole , a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor .
Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system , such as antimycotic agents ( e . g . , itraconazole and miconazole ) or macrolide antibiotics ( e . g . , erythromycin and clarithromycin ) , may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters ( i . e . , C max and AUC ) .
The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known .
Caution should be used when such drugs are co - administered .
• Co - administration with other anticholinergic drugs may increase the frequency and / or severity of anticholinergic - like effects .
( 7 ) • Co - administration with strong cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 inhibitors ( e . g . , ketoconazole ) increases the systemic exposure of oxybutynin .
( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pediatric Use : Oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing , dividing or crushing , or in children under the age of 6 years .
( 8 . 4 ) • Renal or Hepatic Impairment : There have been no studies conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment .
( 8 . 6 , 8 . 7 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies using oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets in pregnant women .
Oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk to the patient and fetus .
Women who become pregnant during oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets treatment are encouraged to contact their physician .
Risk Summary Based on animal data , oxybutynin is predicted to have a low probability of increasing the risk of adverse developmental effects above background risk .
Animal Data Reproduction studies with oxybutynin chloride in the mouse , rat , hamster , and rabbit showed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether oxybutynin is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets are administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24 - week , open - label , non - randomized trial .
Patients were aged 6 to 15 years , all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition ( e . g . , spina bifida ) , all used clean intermittent catheterization , and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride .
Study results demonstrated that administration of oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets 5 to 20 mg / day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL , an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL , and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34 % to 51 % .
Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results .
Administration of oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL , a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O , and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions ( of at least 15 cm H 2 O ) from 60 % to 28 % .
The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets in these patients were consistent with those reported for adults [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing , dividing , or crushing , or in children under the age of 6 .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar .
The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets were similar in all patients studied ( up to 78 years of age ) .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets in patients with renal impairment .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment There were no studies conducted with oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets in patients with hepatic impairment .
10 OVERDOSAGE The continuous release of oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets should be considered in the treatment of overdosage .
Patients should be monitored for at least 24 hours .
Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive .
A cathartic may be administered .
Overdosage with oxybutynin chloride has been associated with anticholinergic effects including central nervous system excitation , flushing , fever , dehydration , cardiac arrhythmia , vomiting , and urinary retention .
Ingestion of 100 mg oxybutynin chloride in association with alcohol has been reported in a 13 - year - old boy who experienced memory loss , and a 34 - year - old woman who developed stupor , followed by disorientation and agitation on awakening , dilated pupils , dry skin , cardiac arrhythmia , and retention of urine .
Both patients fully recovered with symptomatic treatment .
11 DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablet , USP is an antispasmodic , muscarinic antagonist .
Each oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablet , USP contains 5 mg , 10 mg , or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP , formulated as a once - a - day controlled - release tablet for oral administration .
Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R - and S - enantiomers .
Chemically , oxybutynin chloride is d , l ( racemic ) 4 - diethylamino - 2 - butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride .
The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 • HCl .
Its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393 . 9 .
It is readily soluble in water and acids , but relatively insoluble in alkalis .
Oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets , USP contains the following inert ingredients : colloidal anhydrous silicon dioxide , hypromellose , lactose monohydrate , magnesium stearate , methacrylic acid copolymer type - c , microcrystalline cellulose , polyethylene glycol , sodium bicarbonate , sodium lauryl sulfate , talc , titanium dioxide , triethyl citrate .

System Components and Performance Oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets , USP are formulated to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours .
The dosage form is comprised of a hydrophilic cellulose polymer matrix tablet surrounded by an enteric coating system .
The enteric coat is insoluble in the low pH environment of the stomach .
As the tablet passes through the stomach and enters the higher pH environment of the small intestine , the enteric coating dissolves and / or erodes to expose the polymer matrix tablet which swells and releases drug at a controlled rate via diffusion and / or erosion .
Oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets , USP meets USP dissolution test 5 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Oxybutynin relaxes bladder smooth muscle .
Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle .
No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia ( antinicotinic effects ) .
Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R - isomer .
A metabolite , desethyloxybutynin , has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions , cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder ( vesical ) capacity , diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle , and delays the initial desire to void .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours ; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours , minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin .
The relative bioavailabilities of R - and S - oxybutynin from oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets are 156 % and 187 % , respectively , compared with oxybutynin .
The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R - and S - oxybutynin are summarized in Table 2 .
The plasma concentration - time profiles for R - and S - oxybutynin are similar in shape ; Figure 1 shows the profile for R - oxybutynin .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions .
Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption .
The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride .
Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound ( > 99 % ) to plasma proteins .
Both enantiomers of N - desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound ( > 97 % ) to plasma proteins .
The major binding protein is alpha - 1 acid glycoprotein .
Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems , particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall .
Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid , which is pharmacologically inactive , and desethyloxybutynin , which is pharmacologically active .
Following oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets administration , plasma concentrations of R - and S - desethyloxybutynin are 73 % and 92 % , respectively , of concentrations observed with oxybutynin .
Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver , with less than 0 . 1 % of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine .
Also , less than 0 . 1 % of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin .
Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin ( C max and AUC ) following administration of 5 to 20 mg of oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets are dose proportional .
Use in Specific Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets were evaluated in 19 children aged 5 to 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition ( e . g . , spina bifida ) .
The pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults ( see Tables 2 and 3 , and Figures 1 and 2 above ) .
Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets .
Race Available data suggest that there are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin based on race in healthy volunteers following administration of oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility A 24 - month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20 , 80 , and 160 mg / kg / day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity .
These doses are approximately 6 , 25 , and 50 times the maximum human exposure , based on a human equivalent dose taking into account normalization of body surface area .
Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and Salmonella typhimurium test systems .
Reproduction studies with oxybutynin chloride in the mouse , rat , hamster , and rabbit showed no evidence of impaired fertility .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin chloride extended - release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence , urgency , and frequency in three controlled efficacy studies .
The majority of patients were Caucasian ( 89 . 0 % ) and female ( 91 . 9 % ) with a mean age of 59 years ( range , 18 to 98 years ) .
Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence ( with a predominance of urge ) as evidenced by ≥ 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and ≥ 10 micturitions per day .
Study 1 was a fixed - dose escalation design , whereas the other two studies used a dose - adjustment design in which each patient ' s final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects .
All three studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications , and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks .
The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following tables and figures .
