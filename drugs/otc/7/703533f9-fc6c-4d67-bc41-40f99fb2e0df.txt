Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
Reconstitution / Preparation Steps : • Remove vial from refrigerator just prior to use .
• Calculate the dose ( mg / m2 ) and number of vials of Kyprolis required using the patient ' s BSA at baseline .
• Aseptically reconstitute each Kyprolis vial only with Sterile Water for Injection , USP using the volumes described in Table 6 .
Use a 21 - gauge or larger needle ( 0 . 8 mm or smaller external diameter needle ) to reconstitute each vial by slowly injecting Sterile Water for Injection , USP through the stopper and directing the Sterile Water for Injection , USP onto the INSIDE WALL OF THE VIAL to minimize foaming .
There is no data to support the use of closed system transfer devices with Kyprolis .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Table 6 : Reconstitution VolumesStrength Amount of Sterile Water for Injection , USP required for reconstitution 10 mg vial 5 mL 30 mg vial 15 mL 60 mg vial 29 mL • Gently swirl and / or invert the vial slowly for about 1 minute , or until complete dissolution .
DO NOT SHAKE to avoid foam generation .
If foaming occurs , allow the solution to settle in the vial until foaming subsides ( approximately 5 minutes ) and the solution is clear .
• Visually inspect for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration .
The reconstituted product should be a clear , colorless solution and should not be administered if any discoloration or particulate matter is observed .
• Discard any unused portion left in the vial .
DO NOT pool unused portions from the vials .
DO NOT administer more than one dose from a vial .
• Administer Kyprolis directly by intravenous infusion or in a 50 mL to 100 mL intravenous bag containing 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP .
Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus .
• When administering in an intravenous bag , use a 21 - gauge or larger gauge needle ( 0 . 8 mm or smaller external diameter needle ) to withdraw the calculated dose from the vial and dilute into 50 mL or 100 mL intravenous bag containing only 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP ( based on the calculated total dose and infusion time ) .
• Flush the intravenous administration line with normal saline or 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP immediately before and after Kyprolis administration .
• Do not mix Kyprolis with or administer as an infusion with other medicinal products .

5 . 16 Increased Fatal and Serious Toxicities in Combination with Melphalan and Prednisone in Newly Diagnosed Transplant - Ineligible Patients In CLARION , a clinical trial of 955 transplant - ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma randomized to Kyprolis ( 20 / 36 mg / m2 by 30 - minute infusion twice weekly for four of each six - week cycle ) , melphalan and prednisone ( KMP ) or bortezomib , melphalan and prednisone ( VMP ) , a higher incidence of fatal adverse reactions ( 7 % versus 4 % ) and serious adverse reactions ( 50 % versus 42 % ) were observed in the KMP arm compared to patients in the VMP arm , respectively .
Patients in the KMP arm were observed to have a higher incidence of any grade adverse reactions involving cardiac failure ( 11 % versus 4 % ) , hypertension ( 25 % versus 8 % ) , acute renal failure ( 14 % versus 6 % ) , and dyspnea ( 18 % versus 9 % ) .
This study did not meet its primary outcome measure of superiority in progression - free survival ( PFS ) for the KMP arm .
Kyprolis in combination with melphalan and prednisone is not indicated for transplant - ineligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma .
5 . 17 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animals , Kyprolis can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Carfilzomib administered intravenously to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis at a dose approximately 40 % of the clinical dose of 27 mg / m2 based on BSA caused post - implantation loss and a decrease in fetal weight .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Kyprolis and for 6 months following the last dose .
Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Kyprolis and for 3 months following the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .

Table 20 : Grade 3 – 4 Laboratory Abnormalities ( > 10 % ) with Kyprolis MonotherapyLaboratory Abnormality Kyprolis 20 / 56 mg / m2 ( N = 24 ) Kyprolis 20 / 27 mg / m2 ( N = 598 ) Decreased lymphocytes 15 ( 63 ) 151 ( 25 ) Decreased platelets 11 ( 46 ) 184 ( 31 ) Decreased hemoglobin 7 ( 29 ) 132 ( 22 ) Decreased total white blood cell count 3 ( 13 ) 71 ( 12 ) Decreased sodium 2 ( 8 ) 69 ( 12 ) Decreased absolute neutrophil count 2 ( 8 ) 67 ( 11 ) 6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Kyprolis .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure : hemolytic uremic syndrome ( HUS ) , hepatitis B virus reactivation , gastrointestinal perforation , pericarditis , and cytomegalovirus infection , including chorioretinitis , pneumonitis , enterocolitis , viremia , intestinal obstruction , and acute pancreatitis .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Geriatric Use : In the Kyprolis clinical trials , the incidence of adverse reactions was greater in patients ≥ 75 years of age .
( 8 . 5 ) • Hepatic Impairment : Reduce the dose of Kyprolis by 25 % in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment .
( 2 . 4 ) • Patients on Hemodialysis : Administer Kyprolis after the hemodialysis procedure .
( 2 . 1 ) • Lactation : Advise women not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Kyprolis can cause fetal harm based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data on Kyprolis use in pregnant women to evaluate for drug - associated risks .
Kyprolis caused embryo - fetal lethality in rabbits at doses lower than the clinical dose ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % – 4 % and 15 % – 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Carfilzomib administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis was not teratogenic at doses up to 2 mg / kg / day in rats and 0 . 8 mg / kg / day in rabbits .
In rabbits , there was an increase in pre - implantation loss at ≥ 0 . 4 mg / kg / day and an increase in early resorptions and post - implantation loss and a decrease in fetal weight at the maternally toxic dose of 0 . 8 mg / kg / day .
The doses of 0 . 4 and 0 . 8 mg / kg / day in rabbits are approximately 20 % and 40 % , respectively , of the recommended dose in humans of 27 mg / m2 based on BSA .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of Kyprolis in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects of the drug on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Kyprolis and for 2 weeks after treatment .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals , Kyprolis can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing on females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Kyprolis treatment .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Kyprolis and for 6 months following the last dose .
Males Advise males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Kyprolis and for 3 months following the last dose .
Infertility Based on the mechanism of action , Kyprolis may have an effect on either male or female fertility [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
There are no data on the effect of Kyprolis on human fertility .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Kyprolis in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 2 , 837 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma exposed to Kyprolis in monotherapy and combination therapy studies [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 , 14 . 2 , 14 . 3 , 14 . 4 , 14 . 5 ) ] , 50 % were 65 years and older , while 13 % were 75 years and older .
The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 50 % in patients < 65 years of age , 60 % in patients 65 to 74 years of age , and 63 % in patients ≥ 75 years of age .
Of the 308 patients in CANDOR who received DKd , 47 % of patients were 65 years and older , while 9 % were 75 years and older .
Fatal adverse reactions in the DKd arm of CANDOR occurred in 6 % of patients < 65 years of age , 14 % of patients between 65 to 74 years of age , and 14 % of patients ≥ 75 years of age [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between older and younger patients .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Reduce the dose of Kyprolis by 25 % in patients with mild ( total bilirubin 1 to 1 . 5 × ULN and any AST or total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN ) or moderate ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 to 3 × ULN and any AST ) hepatic impairment .
A recommended dosage of Kyprolis has not been established for patients with severe hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 3 × ULN and any AST ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The incidence of serious adverse reactions was higher in patients with mild , moderate , and severe hepatic impairment combined ( 22 / 35 or 63 % ) than in patients with normal hepatic function ( 3 / 11 or 27 % ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 12 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Acute onset of chills , hypotension , renal insufficiency , thrombocytopenia , and lymphopenia has been reported following a dose of 200 mg of Kyprolis administered in error .
There is no known specific antidote for Kyprolis overdosage .

The chemical name for carfilzomib is ( 2 S ) - N - ( ( S ) - 1 - ( ( S ) - 4 - methyl - 1 - ( ( R ) - 2 - methyloxiran - 2 - yl ) - 1 - oxopentan - 2 - ylcarbamoyl ) - 2 - phenylethyl ) - 2 - ( ( S ) - 2 - ( 2 - morpholinoacetamido ) - 4 - phenylbutanamido ) - 4 - methylpentanamide .
Carfilzomib has the following structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Carfilzomib is a crystalline substance with a molecular weight of 719 . 9 .
The molecular formula is C40H57N5O7 .
Carfilzomib is practically insoluble in water and very slightly soluble in acidic conditions .
Kyprolis for injection , for intravenous use is a sterile , white to off - white lyophilized powder in a single - dose vial .
Each 10 mg vial contains 10 mg of carfilzomib , 500 mg sulfobutylether beta - cyclodextrin , and 9 . 6 mg anhydrous citric acid and sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment ( target pH 3 . 5 ) .
Each 30 mg vial contains 30 mg of carfilzomib , 1500 mg sulfobutylether beta - cyclodextrin , and 28 . 8 mg anhydrous citric acid and sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment ( target pH 3 . 5 ) .
Each 60 mg vial contains 60 mg of carfilzomib , 3000 mg sulfobutylether beta - cyclodextrin , 57 . 7 mg citric acid , and sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment ( target pH 3 . 5 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Carfilzomib is a tetrapeptide epoxyketone proteasome inhibitor that irreversibly binds to the N - terminal threonine - containing active sites of the 20 S proteasome , the proteolytic core particle within the 26 S proteasome .
Carfilzomib had antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities in vitro in solid and hematologic tumor cells .
In animals , carfilzomib inhibited proteasome activity in blood and tissue and delayed tumor growth in models of multiple myeloma , hematologic , and solid tumors .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Intravenous carfilzomib administration resulted in suppression of proteasome chymotrypsin - like ( CT - L ) activity when measured in blood 1 hour after the first dose .
Doses of carfilzomib ≥ 15 mg / m2 with or without lenalidomide and dexamethasone induced a ≥ 80 % inhibition of the CT - L activity of the proteasome .
In addition , carfilzomib , 20 mg / m2 intravenously as a single agent , resulted in a mean inhibition of the low molecular mass polypeptide 2 ( LMP2 ) and multicatalytic endopeptidase complex - like 1 ( MECL1 ) subunits of the proteasome ranging from 26 % to 32 % and 41 % to 49 % , respectively .
Proteasome inhibition was maintained for ≥ 48 hours following the first dose of carfilzomib for each week of dosing .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Carfilzomib at doses between 20 mg / m2 and 70 mg / m2 administered as a 30 - minute infusion resulted in dose - dependent increases in maximum plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) and area under the curve over time to infinity ( AUC0 - INF ) in patients with multiple myeloma .
A dose - dependent increase in Cmax and AUC0 - INF was also observed between carfilzomib 20 mg / m2 and 56 mg / m2 as a 2 - to 10 - minute infusion in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma .
A 30 - minute infusion resulted in a similar AUC0 - INF , but 2 - to 3 - fold lower Cmax than that observed with a 2 - to 10 - minute infusion at the same dose .
There was no evidence of carfilzomib accumulation following repeated administration of carfilzomib 70 mg / m2 as a 30 - minute once weekly infusion or 15 and 20 mg / m2 as a 2 - to 10 - minute twice weekly infusion .
Table 21 lists the estimated mean average daily area under the curve in the first cycle ( AUCC1 , avg ) , average daily area under the curve at steady - state ( AUCss ) and Cmax at the highest dose in the first cycle ( Cmax , C1 ) for the different dosing regimens .

Carfilzomib is 97 % bound to human plasma proteins over the concentration range of 0 . 4 to 4 micromolar in vitro .
Elimination Carfilzomib has a half - life of ≤ 1 hour on Day 1 of Cycle 1 following intravenous doses ≥ 15 mg / m2 .
The half - life was similar when administered either as a 30 - minute infusion or a 2 - to 10 - minute infusion .
The systemic clearance ranged from 151 to 263 L / hour .
Metabolism Carfilzomib is rapidly metabolized .
Peptidase cleavage and epoxide hydrolysis were the principal pathways of metabolism .
Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) - mediated mechanisms contribute a minor role in overall carfilzomib metabolism .
Excretion Approximately 25 % of the administered dose of carfilzomib was excreted in urine as metabolites in 24 hours .
Urinary and fecal excretion of the parent compound was negligible ( 0 . 3 % of total dose ) .
Specific Populations Age ( 35 - 89 years ) , sex , race or ethnicity ( 80 % White , 11 % Black , 6 % Asians , 3 % Hispanics ) , and mild to severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance 15 - 89 mL / min ) did not have clinically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of carfilzomib .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Compared to patients with normal hepatic function , patients with mild ( total bilirubin 1 to 1 . 5 × ULN and any AST or total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN ) and moderate ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 to 3 × ULN and any AST ) hepatic impairment had approximately 50 % higher carfilzomib AUC .
The pharmacokinetics of carfilzomib has not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 3 × ULN and any AST ) .
Patients with Renal Impairment Relative to patients with normal renal function , ESRD patients on hemodialysis showed 33 % higher carfilzomib AUC .
Since hemodialysis clearance of Kyprolis concentrations has not been studied , the drug should be administered after the hemodialysis procedure .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of Carfilzomib on Sensitive CYP3A Substrate : Midazolam ( a sensitive CYP3A substrate ) pharmacokinetics was not affected by concomitant administration of carfilzomib .
In Vitro Studies Effect of Carfilzomib on Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) Enzymes : Carfilzomib showed direct and time - dependent inhibition of CYP3A but did not induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 in vitro .
Effect of Transporters on Carfilzomib : Carfilzomib is a P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) substrate in vitro .
Effect of Carfilzomib on Transporters : Carfilzomib inhibits P - gp in vitro .
However , given that Kyprolis is administered intravenously and is extensively metabolized , the pharmacokinetics of Kyprolis is unlikely to be affected by P - gp inhibitors or inducers .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with carfilzomib .
Carfilzomib was clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration test in peripheral blood lymphocytes .
Carfilzomib was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) test and was not clastogenic in the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay .
Fertility studies with carfilzomib have not been conducted .
No effects on reproductive tissues were noted during 28 - day repeat - dose rat and monkey toxicity studies or in 6 - month rat and 9 - month monkey chronic toxicity studies .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Cardiovascular Toxicity Monkeys administered a single bolus intravenous dose of carfilzomib at 3 mg / kg ( approximately 1 . 3 times recommended dose in humans of 27 mg / m2 based on BSA ) experienced hypotension , increased heart rate , and increased serum levels of troponin - T .
Chronic Administration Repeated bolus intravenous administration of carfilzomib at ≥ 2 mg / kg / dose in rats and 2 mg / kg / dose in monkeys using dosing schedules similar to those used clinically resulted in mortalities that were due to toxicities occurring in the cardiovascular ( cardiac failure , cardiac fibrosis , pericardial fluid accumulation , cardiac hemorrhage / degeneration ) , gastrointestinal ( necrosis / hemorrhage ) , renal ( glomerulonephropathy , tubular necrosis , dysfunction ) , and pulmonary ( hemorrhage / inflammation ) systems .
The dose of 2 mg / kg / dose in rats is approximately half the recommended dose in humans of 27 mg / m2 based on BSA .
The dose of 2 mg / kg / dose in monkeys is approximately equivalent to the recommended dose in humans based on BSA .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 In Combination with Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone for Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma ASPIRE ( NCT01080391 ) ASPIRE was a randomized , open - label , multicenter trial which evaluated the combination of Kyprolis with lenalidomide and dexamethasone ( KRd ) versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone ( Rd ) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received 1 to 3 lines of therapy ( A line of therapy is a planned course of treatment [ including sequential induction , transplantation , consolidation , and / or maintenance ] without an interruption for lack of efficacy , such as for relapse or progressive disease ) .
Patients who had the following were excluded from the trial : refractory to bortezomib in the most recent regimen , refractory to lenalidomide and dexamethasone in the most recent regimen , not responding to any prior regimen , creatinine clearance < 50 mL / min , ALT / AST > 3 . 5 × ULN and bilirubin > 2 × ULN , New York Heart Association Class III to IV congestive heart failure , or myocardial infarction within the last 4 months .
In the KRd arm , Kyprolis was evaluated at a starting dose of 20 mg / m2 , which was increased to 27 mg / m2 on Cycle 1 , Day 8 onward .
Kyprolis was administered as a 10 - minute infusion on Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , and 16 of each 28 - day cycle for Cycle 1 through 12 .
Kyprolis was dosed on Days 1 , 2 , 15 , and 16 of each 28 - day cycle from Cycle 13 through 18 .
Dexamethasone 40 mg was administered orally or intravenously on Days 1 , 8 , 15 and 22 of each cycle .
Lenalidomide was given 25 mg orally on Days 1 to 21 of each 28 - day cycle .
The Rd treatment arm had the same regimen for lenalidomide and dexamethasone as the KRd treatment arm .
Kyprolis was administered for a maximum of 18 cycles unless discontinued early for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Lenalidomide and dexamethasone administration could continue until progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Concurrent use of thromboprophylaxis and a proton pump inhibitor were required for both arms and antiviral prophylaxis was required for the KRd arm .
The 792 patients in ASPIRE were randomized 1 : 1 to the KRd or Rd arm .
The demographics and baseline characteristics were well - balanced between the two arms ( see Table 22 ) .
Only 53 % of the patients had testing for genetic mutations ; a high - risk genetic mutation was identified for 12 % of patients in the KRd arm and in 13 % in the Rd arm .

The median PFS was 26 . 3 months in the KRd arm versus 17 . 6 months in the Rd arm ( see Table 23 and Figure 1 ) .
A pre - planned overall survival ( OS ) analysis was performed after 246 deaths in the KRd arm and 267 deaths in the Rd arm .
The median follow - up was approximately 67 months .
A statistically significant advantage in OS was observed in patients in the KRd arm compared to patients in the Rd arm ( see Table 23 and Figure 2 ) .

R . R . O . W . ) .
ENDEAVOR ( NCT01568866 ) ENDEAVOR was a randomized , open - label , multicenter trial of Kyprolis and dexamethasone ( Kd ) versus bortezomib and dexamethasone ( Vd ) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received 1 to 3 lines of therapy .
A total of 929 patients were enrolled and randomized ( 464 in the Kd arm ; 465 in the Vd arm ) .
Randomization was stratified by prior proteasome inhibitor therapy ( yes versus no ) , prior lines of therapy ( 1 versus 2 or 3 ) , current International Staging System stage ( 1 versus 2 or 3 ) , and planned route of bortezomib administration .
Patients were excluded if they had less than PR to all prior regimens ; creatinine clearance < 15 mL / min ; hepatic transaminases ≥ 3 × ULN ; or left - ventricular ejection fraction < 40 % or other significant cardiac conditions .
This trial evaluated Kyprolis at a starting dose of 20 mg / m2 , which was increased to 56 mg / m2 on Cycle 1 , Day 8 onward .
Kyprolis was administered twice weekly as a 30 - minute infusion on Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , and 16 of each 28 - day cycle .
Dexamethasone 20 mg was administered orally or intravenously on Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 , 22 , and 23 of each cycle .
In the Vd arm , bortezomib was dosed at 1 . 3 mg / m2 intravenously or subcutaneously on Days 1 , 4 , 8 , and 11 of a 21 - day cycle , and dexamethasone 20 mg was administered orally or intravenously on Days 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 11 , and 12 of each cycle .
Concurrent use of thromboprophylaxis was optional , and prophylaxis with an antiviral agent and proton pump inhibitor was required .
Of the 465 patients in the Vd arm , 381 received bortezomib subcutaneously .
Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 3 In Combination with Daratumumab and Dexamethasone for Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma The efficacy of Kyprolis in combination with daratumumab and dexamethasone or daratumumab and hyaluronidase - fihj and dexamethasone ( DKd ) was evaluated in three open - label clinical trials ( CANDOR , EQUULEUS , and PLEIADES ) .
CANDOR ( NCT03158688 ) CANDOR was a randomized , open - label , multicenter trial which evaluated the combination of Kyprolis 20 / 56 mg / m2 twice weekly with intravenous daratumumab and dexamethasone ( DKd ) versus Kyprolis 20 / 56 mg / m2 twice weekly and dexamethasone ( Kd ) in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had received 1 to 3 prior lines of therapy .
Patients who had the following were excluded from the trial : known moderate or severe persistent asthma within the past 2 years , known chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) with a FEV1 < 50 % of predicted normal , and active congestive heart failure .
Randomization was stratified by the ISS ( stage 1 or 2 vs stage 3 ) at screening , prior proteasome inhibitor exposure ( yes vs no ) , number of prior lines of therapy ( 1 vs ≥ 2 ) , or prior cluster differentiation antigen 38 ( CD38 ) antibody therapy ( yes vs no ) .
Kyprolis was administered intravenously over 30 minutes at a dose of 20 mg / m2 in Cycle 1 on Days 1 and 2 ; at a dose of 56 mg / m2 in Cycle 1 on Days 8 , 9 , 15 and 16 ; and on Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 and 16 of each 28 - day cycle thereafter .
Dexamethasone 20 mg was administered orally or intravenously on Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 and 16 and then 40 mg orally or intravenously on Day 22 of each 28 - day cycle .
In the DKd arm , daratumumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 8 mg / kg in Cycle 1 on Days 1 and 2 .
Thereafter , daratumumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 16 mg / kg on Days 8 , 15 and 22 of Cycle 1 ; Days 1 , 8 and 15 and 22 of Cycle 2 ; Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 3 to 6 ; and Day 1 for the remaining cycles or until disease progression .
For patients > 75 years on a reduced dexamethasone dose of 20 mg , the entire 20 mg dose was given as a daratumumab pre - infusion medication on days when daratumumab was administered .
Dosing of dexamethasone was otherwise split across days when Kyprolis was administered in both study arms .
Treatment was continued in both arms until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
A total of 466 patients were randomized ; 312 to the DKd arm and 154 to the Kd arm .
The demographics and baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 28 .

Patients had received one to three prior lines of therapy .
Patients were eligible for inclusion if they had an ECOG status of 0 - 2 , platelets ≥ 50 , 000 cells / mm3 , absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1 × 109 / L , creatinine clearance ≥ 15 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ( MDRD formula ) , AST ≤ 3 × ULN , and ALT ≤ 3 × ULN .
A total of 302 patients were randomized in a 3 : 2 ratio to receive either Kyprolis in combination with isatuximab and dexamethasone ( Isa - Kd , 179 patients ) or Kyprolis and dexamethasone ( Kd , 123 patients ) .
Treatment was administered in both groups in 28 - day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Isatuximab 10 mg / kg was administered as an intravenous infusion weekly in the first cycle and every two weeks thereafter .
Kyprolis was administered as an intravenous infusion at the dose of 20 mg / m2 on days 1 and 2 ; 56 mg / m2 on days 8 , 9 , 15 , and 16 of cycle 1 ; and at the dose of 56 mg / m2 on days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , and 16 for subsequent cycles of each 28 - day cycle .
Dexamethasone ( intravenously on the days of isatuximab and / or Kyprolis infusions , and orally on the other days ) 20 mg was given on days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 , 22 , and 23 for each 28 - day cycle .
On the days where both Kyprolis and isatuximab were administered , dexamethasone was administered first , followed by isatuximab infusion , then followed by Kyprolis infusion .
Overall , demographic and disease characteristics at baseline were similar between the two treatment groups .
The median patient age was 64 years ( range 33 - 90 ) , 9 % of patients were ≥ 75 years , 71 % were White , 17 % Asian , and 3 % Black or African American .
The proportion of patients with renal impairment ( eGFR < 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) was 24 % in the Isa - Kd group versus 15 % in the Kd group .
The International Staging System ( ISS ) stage at study entry was I in 53 % , II in 31 % , and III in 15 % of patients .
Overall , 24 % of patients had high - risk chromosomal abnormalities at study entry ; del ( 17 p ) , t ( 4 ; 14 ) , t ( 14 ; 16 ) were present in 11 % , 14 % , and 2 % of patients , respectively .
In addition , gain ( 1q21 ) was present in 42 % of patients .
The median number of prior lines of therapy was 2 ( range 1 - 4 ) with 44 % of patients who received 1 prior line of therapy .
Overall , 90 % of patients received prior proteasome inhibitors , 78 % received prior immunomodulators ( including 43 % who received prior lenalidomide ) , and 61 % received prior stem cell transplantation .
Overall , 33 % of patients were refractory to prior proteasome inhibitors , 45 % were refractory to prior immunomodulators ( including 33 % refractory to lenalidomide ) , and 21 % were refractory to both a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulator .
The median duration of treatment was 80 weeks for the Isa - Kd group compared to 61 weeks for the Kd group .
Efficacy was based upon PFS .
PFS results were assessed by an Independent Response Committee based on central laboratory data for M - protein and central radiologic imaging review using the IMWG criteria .
The improvement in PFS represented a 45 % reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in patients treated with Isa - Kd compared to patients treated with Kd .
