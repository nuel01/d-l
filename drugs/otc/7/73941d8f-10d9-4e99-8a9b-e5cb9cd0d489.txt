( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Cardiac conduction abnormalities : PR interval prolongation may occur in some patients .
ECG monitoring should be considered in patients with preexisting conduction system disease or when administered with other drugs that may prolong the PR interval .
( 5 . 1 , 7 . 3 , 12 . 2 , 17 ) • Severe Skin Reactions : Discontinue if severe rash develops .
( 5 . 2 , 17 ) • Hyperbilirubinemia : Most patients experience asymptomatic increases in indirect bilirubin , which is reversible upon discontinuation .
Do not dose reduce .
If a concomitant transaminase increase occurs , evaluate for alternative etiologies .
( 5 . 8 ) • Hepatotoxicity : Patients with hepatitis B or C infection are at risk of increased transaminases or hepatic decompensation .
Monitor hepatic laboratory tests prior to therapy and during treatment .
( 2 . 8 , 5 . 4 , 8 . 8 ) • Chronic kidney disease has been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV - infected patients treated with atazanavir , with or without ritonavir .
Consider alternatives in patients at high risk for renal disease or with preexisting renal disease .
Monitor renal laboratory tests prior to therapy and during treatment .
Consider discontinuation of atazanavir sulfate in patients with progressive renal disease .
( 5 . 5 ) • Nephrolithiasis and cholelithiasis have been reported .
Consider temporary interruption or discontinuation .
( 5 . 6 ) • The concomitant use of atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir and certain other medications may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions .
Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions .
( 5 . 7 , 7 . 3 ) • Patients receiving atazanavir sulfate may develop new onset or exacerbations of diabetes mellitus / hyperglycemia ( 5 . 9 ) , immune reconstitution syndrome ( 5 . 10 ) , and redistribution / accumulation of body fat ( 5 . 11 ) .
• Hemophilia : Spontaneous bleeding may occur and additional factor VIII may be required .
( 5 . 12 ) 5 . 1 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities Atazanavir sulfate has been shown to prolong the PR interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients .
In healthy volunteers and in patients , abnormalities in atrioventricular ( AV ) conduction were asymptomatic and generally limited to first - degree AV block .
There have been reports of second - degree AV block and other conduction abnormalities [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
In clinical trials that included electrocardiograms , asymptomatic first - degree AV block was observed in 5 . 9 % of atazanavir - treated patients ( n = 920 ) , 5 . 2 % of lopinavir / ritonavir - treated patients ( n = 252 ) , 10 . 4 % of nelfinavir - treated patients ( n = 48 ) , and 3 . 0 % of efavirenz - treated patients ( n = 329 ) .
In Study AI424 - 045 , asymptomatic first - degree AV block was observed in 5 % ( 6 / 118 ) of atazanavir / ritonavir - treated patients and 5 % ( 6 / 116 ) of lopinavir / ritonavir - treated patients who had on - study electrocardiogram measurements .
Because of limited clinical experience in patients with preexisting conduction system disease ( e . g . , marked first - degree AV block or second - or third - degree AV block ) .
ECG monitoring should be considered in these patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 2 Severe Skin Reactions In controlled clinical trials , rash ( all grades , regardless of causality ) occurred in approximately 20 % of patients treated with atazanavir sulfate .
The median time to onset of rash in clinical studies was 7 . 3 weeks and the median duration of rash was 1 . 4 weeks .
Rashes were generally mild - to - moderate maculopapular skin eruptions .
Treatment - emergent adverse reactions of moderate or severe rash ( occurring at a rate of ≥ 2 % ) are presented for the individual clinical studies [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Dosing with atazanavir sulfate was often continued without interruption in patients who developed rash .
The discontinuation rate for rash in clinical trials was < 1 % .
Cases of Stevens - Johnson syndrome , erythema multiforme , and toxic skin eruptions , including drug rash , eosinophilia , and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) syndrome , have been reported in patients receiving atazanavir sulfate [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Atazanavir sulfate should be discontinued if severe rash develops .
5 . 4 Hepatotoxicity Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C viral infections or marked elevations in transaminases before treatment may be at increased risk for developing further transaminase elevations or hepatic decompensation .
In these patients , hepatic laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with atazanavir sulfate and during treatment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 8 ) ] .
5 . 5 Chronic Kidney Disease Chronic kidney disease in HIV - infected patients treated with atazanavir , with or without ritonavir , has been reported during postmarketing surveillance .
Reports included biopsy - proven cases of granulomatous interstitial nephritis associated with the deposition of atazanavir drug crystals in the renal parenchyma .
Consider alternatives to atazanavir sulfate in patients at high risk for renal disease or with preexisting renal disease .
Renal laboratory testing ( including serum creatinine , estimated creatinine clearance , and urinalysis with microscopic examination ) should be conducted in all patients prior to initiating therapy with atazanavir sulfate and continued during treatment with atazanavir sulfate .
Expert consultation is advised for patients who have confirmed renal laboratory abnormalities while taking atazanavir sulfate .
In patients with progressive kidney disease , discontinuation of atazanavir sulfate may be considered [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 and 2 . 7 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 6 Nephrolithiasis and Cholelithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis and / or cholelithiasis have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV - infected patients receiving atazanavir sulfate therapy .
Some patients required hospitalization for additional management and some had complications .
Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice , estimates of frequency cannot be made .
If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis and / or cholelithiasis occur , temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 7 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions Initiation of atazanavir sulfate with ritonavir , a CYP3A inhibitor , in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving atazanavir sulfate with ritonavir , may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A .
Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of atazanavir sulfate with ritonavir , respectively .
These interactions may lead to : • clinically significant adverse reactions potentially leading to severe , life - threatening , or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications .
• clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of atazanavir sulfate with ritonavir .
• loss of therapeutic effect of atazanavir sulfate with ritonavir and possible development of resistance .
See Table 16 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions , including dosing recommendations [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir therapy ; review concomitant medications during atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir therapy ; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
5 . 8 Hyperbilirubinemia Most patients taking atazanavir sulfate experience asymptomatic elevations in indirect ( unconjugated ) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP - glucuronosyl transferase ( UGT ) .
This hyperbilirubinemia is reversible upon discontinuation of atazanavir sulfate .
Hepatic transaminase elevations that occur with hyperbilirubinemia should be evaluated for alternative etiologies .
No long - term safety data are available for patients experiencing persistent elevations in total bilirubin > 5 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) .
Alternative antiretroviral therapy to atazanavir sulfate may be considered if jaundice or scleral icterus associated with bilirubin elevations presents cosmetic concerns for patients .
Dose reduction of atazanavir is not recommended since long - term efficacy of reduced doses has not been established [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 9 Diabetes Mellitus / Hyperglycemia New - onset diabetes mellitus , exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus , and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV - infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy .
Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events .
In some cases , diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred .
In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy , hyperglycemia persisted in some cases .
Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice , estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 10 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy , including atazanavir sulfate .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia , or tuberculosis ) , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
Autoimmune disorders ( such as Graves ’ disease , polymyositis , and Guillain - Barré syndrome ) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution ; however , the time to onset is more variable , and can occur many months after initiation of treatment .
5 . 11 Fat Redistribution Redistribution / accumulation of body fat including central obesity , dorsocervical fat enlargement ( buffalo hump ) , peripheral wasting , facial wasting , breast enlargement , and “ cushingoid appearance ” have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy .
The mechanism and long - term consequences of these events are currently unknown .
A causal relationship has not been established .
5 . 12 Hemophilia There have been reports of increased bleeding , including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis , in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors .
In some patients additional factor VIII was given .
In more than half of the reported cases , treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced .
A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established .
5 . 13 Resistance / Cross - Resistance Various degrees of cross - resistance among protease inhibitors have been observed .
Resistance to atazanavir may not preclude the subsequent use of other protease inhibitors [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling : • cardiac conduction abnormalities [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • rash [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • hyperbilirubinemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] • chronic kidney disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • nephrolithiasis and cholelithiasis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 2 % ) are nausea , jaundice / scleral icterus , rash , headache , abdominal pain , vomiting , insomnia , peripheral neurologic symptoms , dizziness , myalgia , diarrhea , depression , and fever .

Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients : Atazanavir Sulfate Capsules The safety and tolerability of atazanavir sulfate capsules with and without ritonavir have been established in pediatric patients at least 6 years of age from the open - label , multicenter clinical trial PACTG 1020 A .
The safety profile of atazanavir sulfate in pediatric patients ( 6 to less than 18 years of age ) taking the capsule formulation was generally similar to that observed in clinical studies of atazanavir sulfate in adults .
The most common Grade 2 to 4 adverse events ( ≥ 5 % , regardless of causality ) reported in pediatric patients were cough ( 21 % ) , fever ( 18 % ) , jaundice / scleral icterus ( 15 % ) , rash ( 14 % ) , vomiting ( 12 % ) , diarrhea ( 9 % ) , headache ( 8 % ) , peripheral edema ( 7 % ) , extremity pain ( 6 % ) , nasal congestion ( 6 % ) , oropharyngeal pain ( 6 % ) , wheezing ( 6 % ) , and rhinorrhea ( 6 % ) .
Asymptomatic second - degree atrioventricular block was reported in < 2 % of patients .
The most common Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities occurring in pediatric patients taking the capsule formulation were elevation of total bilirubin ( ≥ 3 . 2 mg / dL , 58 % ) , neutropenia ( 9 % ) , and hypoglycemia ( 4 % ) .
All other Grade 3 to 4 laboratory abnormalities occurred with a frequency of less than 3 % .
Adverse Reactions in Patients Co - Infected with Hepatitis B and / or Hepatitis C Virus In Study AI424 - 138 , 60 patients treated with atazanavir / ritonavir 300 mg / 100 mg once daily , and 51 patients treated with lopinavir / ritonavir 400 mg / 100 mg twice daily , each with fixed dose tenofovir DF - emtricitabine , were seropositive for hepatitis B and / or C at study entry .
ALT levels > 5 times ULN developed in 10 % ( 6 / 60 ) of the atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir - treated patients and 8 % ( 4 / 50 ) of the lopinavir / ritonavir - treated patients .
AST levels > 5 times ULN developed in 10 % ( 6 / 60 ) of the atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir - treated patients and none ( 0 / 50 ) of the lopinavir / ritonavir - treated patients .
In Study AI424 - 045 , 20 patients treated with atazanavir / ritonavir 300 mg / 100 mg once daily , and 18 patients treated with lopinavir / ritonavir 400 mg / 100 mg twice daily , were seropositive for hepatitis B and / or C at study entry .
ALT levels > 5 times ULN developed in 25 % ( 5 / 20 ) of the atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir - treated patients and 6 % ( 1 / 18 ) of the lopinavir / ritonavir - treated patients .
AST levels > 5 times ULN developed in 10 % ( 2 / 20 ) of the atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir - treated patients and 6 % ( 1 / 18 ) of the lopinavir / ritonavir - treated patients .
In Studies AI424 - 008 and AI424 - 034 , 74 patients treated with 400 mg of atazanavir once daily , 58 who received efavirenz , and 12 who received nelfinavir were seropositive for hepatitis B and / or C at study entry .
ALT levels > 5 times ULN developed in 15 % of the atazanavir sulfate - treated patients , 14 % of the efavirenz - treated patients , and 17 % of the nelfinavir - treated patients .
AST levels > 5 times ULN developed in 9 % of the atazanavir sulfate - treated patients , 5 % of the efavirenz - treated patients , and 17 % of the nelfinavir ‑ treated patients .
Within atazanavir sulfate and control regimens , no difference in frequency of bilirubin elevations was noted between seropositive and seronegative patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following events have been identified during postmarketing use of atazanavir sulfate .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Body as a Whole : edema Cardiovascular System : second - degree AV block , third - degree AV block , left bundle branch block , QTc prolongation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] Gastrointestinal System : pancreatitis Hepatic System : hepatic function abnormalities Hepatobiliary Disorders : cholelithiasis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] , cholecystitis , cholestasis Metabolic System and Nutrition Disorders : diabetes mellitus , hyperglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] Musculoskeletal System : arthralgia Renal System : nephrolithiasis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] , interstitial nephritis , granulomatous interstitial nephritis , chronic kidney disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] Skin and Appendages : alopecia , maculopapular rash [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] , pruritus , angioedema 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Coadministration of atazanavir sulfate can alter the concentration of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of atazanavir .
The potential drug - drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy .
( 4 , 7 , 12 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Potential for Atazanavir Sulfate to Affect Other Drugs Atazanavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A and UGT1A1 .
Coadministration of atazanavir sulfate and drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A or UGT1A1 may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other drug that could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effects .
Atazanavir is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 .
Use of atazanavir sulfate without ritonavir is not recommended when coadministered with drugs highly dependent on CYP2C8 with narrow therapeutic indices ( e . g . , paclitaxel , repaglinide ) .
When atazanavir sulfate with ritonavir is coadministered with substrates of CYP2C8 , clinically significant interactions are not expected [ see Clinical Pharmacology , Table 22 ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The magnitude of CYP3A - mediated drug interactions on coadministered drug may change when atazanavir sulfate is coadministered with ritonavir .
See the complete prescribing information for ritonavir for information on drug interactions with ritonavir .
7 . 2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Atazanavir Sulfate Atazanavir is a CYP3A4 substrate ; therefore , drugs that induce CYP3A4 may decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations and reduce atazanavir sulfate ’ s therapeutic effect .
Atazanavir solubility decreases as pH increases .
Reduced plasma concentrations of atazanavir are expected if proton - pump inhibitors , antacids , buffered medications , or H2 - receptor antagonists are administered with atazanavir sulfate [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 , 2 . 4 , and 2 . 6 ) ] .
7 . 3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Table 16 provides dosing recommendations in adults as a result of drug interactions with atazanavir sulfate .
These recommendations are based on either drug interaction studies or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious events or loss of efficacy .
Table 16 : Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions : Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies1 or Predicted Interactions ( Information in the table applies to Atazanavir Sulfate with or without ritonavir , unless otherwise indicated ) Concomitant Drug Class : Specific Drugs Effect on Concentration of Atazanavir or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment HIV Antiviral Agents Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors ( NRTIs ) : didanosine buffered formulations enteric - coated ( EC ) capsules ↓ atazanavir ↓ didanosine Coadministration of atazanavir sulfate with didanosine buffered tablets resulted in a marked decrease in atazanavir exposure .
It is recommended that atazanavir sulfate be given ( with food ) 2 h before or 1 h after didanosine buffered formulations .
Simultaneous administration of didanosine EC and atazanavir sulfate with food results in a decrease in didanosine exposure .
Thus , atazanavir sulfate and didanosine EC should be administered at different times .
Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors : tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( DF ) ↓ atazanavir ↑ tenofovir Tenofovir DF may decrease the AUC and Cmin of atazanavir .
When coadministered with tenofovir DF in adults , it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg be given with ritonavir 100 mg and tenofovir DF 300 mg ( all as a single daily dose with food ) .
Atazanavir sulfate increases tenofovir concentrations .
The mechanism of this interaction is unknown .
Higher tenofovir concentrations could potentiate tenofovir - associated adverse reactions , including renal disorders .
Patients receiving atazanavir sulfate and tenofovir DF should be monitored for tenofovir - associated adverse reactions .
For pregnant women taking atazanavir sulfate with ritonavir and tenofovir DF , see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) .
Non - nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors ( NNRTIs ) : efavirenz ↓ atazanavir Efavirenz decreases atazanavir exposure .
In treatment - naive adult patients : If atazanavir sulfate is combined with efavirenz , atazanavir 400 mg ( two 200 mg capsules ) should be administered with ritonavir 100 mg simultaneously once daily with food , and efavirenz 600 mg should be administered once daily on an empty stomach , preferably at bedtime .
In treatment - experienced adult patients : Coadministration of atazanavir sulfate with efavirenz in treatment - experienced patients is not recommended due to decreased atazanavir exposure .
Protease Inhibitors : saquinavir ( soft gelatin capsules ) ↑ saquinavir Appropriate dosing recommendations for this combination , with or without ritonavir , with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established .
In a clinical study , saquinavir 1200 mg coadministered with atazanavir 400 mg and tenofovir DF 300 mg ( all given once daily ) plus nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors did not provide adequate efficacy [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Ritonavir ↑ atazanavir If atazanavir sulfate is coadministered with ritonavir , it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg once daily be given with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food in adults .
See the complete prescribing information for ritonavir for information on drug interactions with ritonavir .
Others ↑ other protease inhibitor Although not studied , the coadministration of atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir and an additional protease inhibitor would be expected to increase exposure to the other protease inhibitor .
Such coadministration is not recommended .
HCV Antiviral Agents Protease Inhibitors : boceprevir ↓ atazanavir ↓ ritonavir Concomitant administration of boceprevir and atazanavir / ritonavir resulted in reduced steady - state exposures to atazanavir and ritonavir .
Coadministration of atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir and boceprevir is not recommended .
sofosbuvir , velpatasvir , voxilaprevir ↑ voxilaprevir Coadministration with atazanavir sulfate is not recommended .
Other Agents Antacids and buffered medications ↓ atazanavir Reduced plasma concentrations of atazanavir are expected if antacids , including buffered medications , are administered with atazanavir sulfate .
Atazanavir sulfate should be administered 2 hours before or 1 hour after these medications .
Antiarrhythmics : amiodarone , bepridil , lidocaine ( systemic ) , quinidine ↑ amiodarone , bepridil , lidocaine ( systemic ) , quinidine Coadministration with atazanavir sulfate has the potential to produce serious and / or life - threatening adverse events and has not been studied .
Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring of these drugs is recommended if they are used concomitantly with atazanavir sulfate .
Anticoagulants : warfarin ↑ warfarin Coadministration with atazanavir sulfate has the potential to produce serious and / or life - threatening bleeding and has not been studied .
It is recommended that International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) be monitored .
Antidepressants : tricyclic antidepressants ↑ tricyclic antidepressants Coadministration with atazanavir sulfate has the potential to produce serious and / or life - threatening adverse events and has not been studied .
Concentration monitoring of these drugs is recommended if they are used concomitantly with atazanavir sulfate .
Trazodone ↑ trazodone Concomitant use of trazodone and atazanavir sulfate with or without ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of trazodone .
Nausea , dizziness , hypotension , and syncope have been observed following coadministration of trazodone and ritonavir .
If trazodone is used with a CYP3A4 inhibitor such as atazanavir sulfate , the combination should be used with caution and a lower dose of trazodone should be considered .
Antiepileptics : carbamazepine ↓ atazanavir ↑ carbamazepine Plasma concentrations of atazanavir may be decreased when carbamazepine is administered with atazanavir sulfate without ritonavir .
Coadministration of carbamazepine and atazanavir sulfate without ritonavir is not recommended .
Ritonavir may increase plasma levels of carbamazepine .
If patients beginning treatment with atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir have been titrated to a stable dose of carbamazepine , a dose reduction for carbamazepine may be necessary .
phenytoin , phenobarbital ↓ atazanavir ↓ phenytoin ↓ phenobarbital Plasma concentrations of atazanavir may be decreased when phenytoin or phenobarbital is administered with atazanavir sulfate without ritonavir .
Coadministration of phenytoin or phenobarbital and atazanavir sulfate without ritonavir is not recommended .
Ritonavir may decrease plasma levels of phenytoin and phenobarbital .
When atazanavir sulfate with ritonavir is coadministered with either phenytoin or phenobarbital , a dose adjustment of phenytoin or phenobarbital may be required .
Lamotrigine ↓ lamotrigine Coadministration of lamotrigine and atazanavir sulfate with ritonavir may decrease lamotrigine plasma concentrations .
Dose adjustment of lamotrigine may be required when coadministered with atazanavir sulfate and ritonavir .
Coadministration of lamotrigine and atazanavir sulfate without ritonavir is not expected to decrease lamotrigine plasma concentrations .
No dose adjustment of lamotrigine is required when coadministered with atazanavir sulfate without ritonavir .
Antifungals : ketoconazole , itraconazole Atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir : ↑ ketoconazole ↑ itraconazole Coadministration of ketoconazole has only been studied with atazanavir sulfate without ritonavir ( negligible increase in atazanavir AUC and Cmax ) .
Due to the effect of ritonavir on ketoconazole , high doses of ketoconazole and itraconazole ( > 200 mg / day ) should be used cautiously with atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir .
Voriconazole Atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir in subjects with a functional CYP2C19 allele : ↓ voriconazole ↓ atazanavir Atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir in subjects without a functional CYP2C19 allele : ↑ voriconazole ↓ atazanavir The use of voriconazole in patients receiving atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir is not recommended unless an assessment of the benefit / risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole .
Patients should be carefully monitored for voriconazole - associated adverse reactions and loss of either voriconazole or atazanavir efficacy during the coadministration of voriconazole and atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir .
Coadministration of voriconazole with atazanavir sulfate ( without ritonavir ) may affect atazanavir concentrations ; however , no data are available .
Antigout : colchicine ↑ colchicine The coadministration of atazanavir sulfate with colchicine in patients with renal or hepatic impairment is not recommended .
Recommended adult dosage of colchicine when administered with atazanavir sulfate : Treatment of gout flares : 0 . 6 mg ( 1 tablet ) for 1 dose , followed by 0 . 3 mg ( half tablet ) 1 hour later .
Not to be repeated before 3 days .
Prophylaxis of gout flares : If the original regimen was 0 . 6 mg twice a day , the regimen should be adjusted to 0 . 3 mg once a day .
If the original regimen was 0 . 6 mg once a day , the regimen should be adjusted to 0 . 3 mg once every other day .
Treatment of familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) : Maximum daily dose of 0 . 6 mg ( may be given as 0 . 3 mg twice a day ) .
Antimycobacterials : rifabutin ↑ rifabutin A rifabutin dose reduction of up to 75 % ( e . g . , 150 mg every other day or 3 times per week ) is recommended .
Increased monitoring for rifabutin - associated adverse reactions including neutropenia is warranted .
Antipsychotics : quetiapine and lurasidone ↑ quetiapine atazanavir sulfate ↑ lurasidone atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir ↑ lurasidone Initiation of atazanavir sulfate with ritonavir in patients taking quetiapine : Consider alternative antiretroviral therapy to avoid increases in quetiapine exposures .
If coadministration is necessary , reduce the quetiapine dose to 1 / 6 of the current dose and monitor for quetiapine - associated adverse reactions .
Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for recommendations on adverse reaction monitoring .
Initiation of quetiapine in patients taking atazanavir sulfate with ritonavir : Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for initial dosing and titration of quetiapine .
Atazanavir sulfate without ritonavir If coadministration is necessary , reduce the lurasidone dose .
Refer to the lurasidone prescribing information for concomitant use with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors .
Atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir Use of lurasidone is contraindicated .
Benzodiazepines : parenterally administered midazolam2 ↑ midazolam Concomitant use of parenteral midazolam with atazanavir sulfate may increase plasma concentrations of midazolam .
Coadministration should be done in a setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and / or prolonged sedation .
Dosage reduction for midazolam should be considered , especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered .
Coadministration of oral midazolam with atazanavir sulfate is CONTRAINDICATED .
Calcium channel blockers : diltiazem ↑ diltiazem and desacetyl - diltiazem Caution is warranted .
A dose reduction of diltiazem by 50 % should be considered .
ECG monitoring is recommended .
Coadministration of atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir with diltiazem has not been studied .
felodipine , nifedipine , nicardipine , and verapamil ↑ calcium channel blocker Caution is warranted .
Dose titration of the calcium channel blocker should be considered .
ECG monitoring is recommended .
Endothelin receptor antagonists : bosentan ↓ atazanavir ↑ bosentan Plasma concentrations of atazanavir may be decreased when bosentan is administered with atazanavir sulfate without ritonavir .
Coadministration of bosentan and atazanavir sulfate without ritonavir is not recommended .
Coadministration of bosentan in adult patients on atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir : For patients who have been receiving atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir for at least 10 days , start bosentan at 62 . 5 mg once daily or every other day based on individual tolerability .
Coadministration of atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir in adult patients on bosentan : Discontinue bosentan at least 36 hours before starting atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir .
At least 10 days after starting atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir , resume bosentan at 62 . 5 mg once daily or every other day based on individual tolerability .
HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors : atorvastatin , rosuvastatin ↑ atorvastatin ↑ rosuvastatin Titrate atorvastatin dose carefully and use the lowest necessary dose .
Rosuvastatin dose should not exceed 10 mg / day .
The risk of myopathy , including rhabdomyolysis , may be increased when HIV protease inhibitors , including atazanavir sulfate , are used in combination with these drugs .
H2 - Receptor antagonists ↓ atazanavir Plasma concentrations of atazanavir were substantially decreased when atazanavir 400 mg once daily was administered simultaneously with famotidine 40 mg twice daily in adults , which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance .
In treatment - naive adult patients : Atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food should be administered simultaneously with , and / or at least 10 hours after , a dose of the H2 - receptor antagonist ( H2RA ) .
An H2RA dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg once daily up to a dose comparable to famotidine 40 mg twice daily can be used with atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg in treatment - naive patients .
OR For patients unable to tolerate ritonavir , atazanavir 400 mg once daily with food should be administered at least 2 hours before and at least 10 hours after a dose of the H2RA .
No single dose of the H2RA should exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg , and the total daily dose should not exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 40 mg .
The use of atazanavir sulfate without ritonavir in pregnant women is not recommended .
In treatment - experienced adult patients : Whenever an H2RA is given to a patient receiving atazanavir sulfate with ritonavir , the H2RA dose should not exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg twice daily , and the atazanavir sulfate and ritonavir doses should be administered simultaneously with , and / or at least 10 hours after , the dose of the H2RA .
• Atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily ( all as a single dose with food ) if taken with an H2RA .
• Atazanavir 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily ( all as a single dose with food ) if taken with both tenofovir DF and an H2RA .
• Atazanavir 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily ( all as a single dose with food ) if taken with either tenofovir DF or an H2RA for pregnant women during the second and third trimester .
Atazanavir sulfate is not recommended for pregnant women during the second and third trimester taking atazanavir sulfate with both tenofovir DF and an H2RA .
Hormonal contraceptives : ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate or norethindrone ↓ ethinyl estradiol ↑ norgestimate3 Use with caution if coadministration of atazanavir sulfate or atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir with oral contraceptives is considered .
If an oral contraceptive is administered with atazanavir sulfate plus ritonavir , it is recommended that the oral contraceptive contain at least 35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol .
If atazanavir sulfate is administered without ritonavir , the oral contraceptive should contain no more than 30 mcg of ethinyl estradiol .
↑ ethinyl estradiol ↑ norethindrone4 Potential safety risks include substantial increases in progesterone exposure .
The long - term effects of increases in concentration of the progestational agent are unknown and could increase the risk of insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , and acne .
Coadministration of atazanavir sulfate or atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir with other hormonal contraceptives ( e . g . , contraceptive patch , contraceptive vaginal ring , or injectable contraceptives ) or oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norethindrone or norgestimate , or less than 25 mcg of ethinyl estradiol , has not been studied ; therefore , alternative methods of contraception are recommended .
Immunosuppressants : cyclosporine , sirolimus , tacrolimus ↑ immunosuppressants Therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for these immunosuppressants when coadministered with atazanavir sulfate .
Inhaled beta agonist : salmeterol ↑ salmeterol Coadministration of salmeterol with atazanavir sulfate is not recommended .
Concomitant use of salmeterol and atazanavir sulfate may result in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse reactions associated with salmeterol , including QT prolongation , palpitations , and sinus tachycardia .
Inhaled / nasal steroid : fluticasone Atazanavir sulfate ↑ fluticasone Concomitant use of fluticasone propionate and atazanavir sulfate ( without ritonavir ) may increase plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate .
Use with caution .
Consider alternatives to fluticasone propionate , particularly for long - term use .
Atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir ↑ fluticasone Concomitant use of fluticasone propionate and atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate , resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations .
Systemic corticosteroid effects , including Cushing ’ s syndrome and adrenal suppression , have been reported during postmarketing use in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate .
Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Macrolide antibiotics : clarithromycin ↑ clarithromycin ↓ 14 - OH clarithromycin ↑ atazanavir Increased concentrations of clarithromycin may cause QTc prolongations ; therefore , a dose reduction of clarithromycin by 50 % should be considered when it is coadministered with atazanavir sulfate .
In addition , concentrations of the active metabolite 14 - OH clarithromycin are significantly reduced ; consider alternative therapy for indications other than infections due to Mycobacterium avium complex .
Coadministration of atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir with clarithromycin has not been studied .
Opioids : Buprenorphine ↑ buprenorphine ↑ norbuprenorphine Coadministration of buprenorphine and atazanavir sulfate with or without ritonavir increases the plasma concentration of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine .
Coadministration of atazanavir sulfate plus ritonavir with buprenorphine warrants clinical monitoring for sedation and cognitive effects .
A dose reduction of buprenorphine may be considered .
Coadministration of buprenorphine and atazanavir sulfate with ritonavir is not expected to decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations .
Coadministration of buprenorphine and atazanavir sulfate without ritonavir may decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations .
The coadministration of atazanavir sulfate and buprenorphine without ritonavir is not recommended .
PDE5 inhibitors : sildenafil , tadalafil , vardenafil ↑ sildenafil ↑ tadalafil ↑ vardenafil Coadministration with atazanavir sulfate has not been studied but may result in an increase in PDE5 inhibitor - associated adverse reactions , including hypotension , syncope , visual disturbances , and priapism .
Use of PDE5 inhibitors for pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) : Use of REVATIO ® ( sildenafil ) for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension ( PAH ) is contraindicated with atazanavir sulfate [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
The following dose adjustments are recommended for the use of ADCIRCA ® ( tadalafil ) with atazanavir sulfate : Coadministration of ADCIRCA ® in patients on atazanavir sulfate ( with or without ritonavir ) : • For patients receiving atazanavir sulfate ( with or without ritonavir ) for at least one week , start ADCIRCA ® at 20 mg once daily .
Increase to 40 mg once daily based on individual tolerability .
Coadministration of atazanavir sulfate ( with or without ritonavir ) in patients on ADCIRCA ® : • Avoid the use of ADCIRCA ® when starting atazanavir sulfate ( with or without ritonavir ) .
Stop ADCIRCA ® at least 24 hours before starting atazanavir sulfate ( with or without ritonavir ) .
At least one week after starting atazanavir sulfate ( with or without ritonavir ) , resume ADCIRCA ® at 20 mg once daily .
Increase to 40 mg once daily based on individual tolerability .
Use of PDE5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction : Use VIAGRA ® ( sildenafil ) with caution at reduced doses of 25 mg every 48 hours with increased monitoring for adverse events .
Use CIALIS ® ( tadalafil ) with caution at reduced doses of 10 mg every 72 hours with increased monitoring for adverse events .
Atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir : Use vardenafil with caution at reduced doses of no more than 2 . 5 mg every 72 hours with increased monitoring for adverse reactions .
Atazanavir sulfate : Use vardenafil with caution at reduced doses of no more than 2 . 5 mg every 24 hours with increased monitoring for adverse reactions .
Proton - pump inhibitors : omeprazole ↓ atazanavir Plasma concentrations of atazanavir were substantially decreased when atazanavir 400 mg or atazanavir 300 mg / ritonavir 100 mg once daily was administered with omeprazole 40 mg once daily in adults , which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance .
In treatment - naive adult patients : The proton - pump inhibitor ( PPI ) dose should not exceed a dose comparable to omeprazole 20 mg and must be taken approximately 12 hours prior to the atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg dose .
In treatment - experienced adult patients : The use of PPIs in treatment - experienced patients receiving atazanavir sulfate is not recommended .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Available human and animal data suggest that atazanavir does not increase the risk of major birth defects overall compared to the background rate .
( 8 . 1 ) • Lactation : Breastfeeding is not recommended .
( 8 . 2 ) • Hepatitis B or C co - infection : Monitor liver enzymes .
( 5 . 4 , 6 . 1 ) • Renal impairment : Atazanavir sulfate is not recommended for use in treatment - experienced patients with end - stage renal disease managed with hemodialysis .
( 2 . 7 , 8 . 7 ) • Hepatic impairment : Atazanavir sulfate is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
Atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir is not recommended in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment .
( 2 . 8 , 8 . 8 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to atazanavir sulfate during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry ( APR ) at 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
Risk Summary Atazanavir has been evaluated in a limited number of women during pregnancy .
Available human and animal data suggest that atazanavir does not increase the risk of major birth defects overall compared to the background rate [ see Data ] .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
No treatment - related malformations were observed in rats and rabbits , for which the atazanavir exposures were 0 . 7 to 1 . 2 times of those at the human clinical dose ( 300 mg / day atazanavir boosted with 100 mg / day ritonavir ) .
When atazanavir was administered to rats during pregnancy and throughout lactation , reversible neonatal growth retardation was observed [ see Data ] .
Clinical Considerations Dose Adjustments during Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period • Atazanavir sulfate must be administered with ritonavir in pregnant women .
• For pregnant patients , no dosage adjustment is required for atazanavir sulfate with the following exceptions : • For treatment - experienced pregnant women during the second or third trimester , when atazanavir sulfate is coadministered with either an H2 - receptor antagonist or tenofovir DF , atazanavir 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily is recommended .
There are insufficient data to recommend an atazanavir sulfate dose for use with both an H2 - receptor antagonist and tenofovir DF in treatment - experienced pregnant women .
• No dosage adjustment is required for postpartum patients .
However , patients should be closely monitored for adverse events because atazanavir exposures could be higher during the first 2 months after delivery [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Maternal Adverse Reactions Cases of lactic acidosis syndrome , sometimes fatal , and symptomatic hyperlactatemia have occurred in pregnant women using atazanavir sulfate in combination with nucleoside analogues , which are associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis syndrome .
Hyperbilirubinemia occurs frequently in patients who take atazanavir sulfate [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] , including pregnant women [ see Data ] .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risks of lactic acidosis syndrome and hyperbilirubinemia .
Fetal / Neonatal Adverse Reactions All infants , including neonates exposed to atazanavir sulfate in utero , should be monitored for the development of severe hyperbilirubinemia during the first few days of life [ see Data ] .
Data Human Data In clinical trial AI424 - 182 , atazanavir / ritonavir ( 300 mg / 100 mg or 400 mg / 100 mg ) in combination with zidovudine / lamivudine was administered to 41 HIV - infected pregnant women during the second or third trimester .
Among the 39 women who completed the study , 38 women achieved an HIV RNA less than 50 copies / mL at time of delivery .
Six of 20 ( 30 % ) women on atazanavir / ritonavir 300 mg / 100 mg and 13 of 21 ( 62 % ) women on atazanavir / ritonavir 400 mg / 100 mg experienced hyperbilirubinemia ( total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 . 6 times ULN ) .
There were no cases of lactic acidosis observed in clinical trial AI424 - 182 .
Atazanavir drug concentrations in fetal umbilical cord blood were approximately 12 % to 19 % of maternal concentrations .
Among the 40 infants born to 40 HIV - infected pregnant women , all had test results that were negative for HIV - 1 DNA at the time of delivery and / or during the first 6 months postpartum .
All 40 infants received antiretroviral prophylactic treatment containing zidovudine .
No evidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia ( total bilirubin levels greater than 20 mg / dL ) or acute or chronic bilirubin encephalopathy was observed among neonates in this study .
However , 10 / 36 ( 28 % ) infants ( 6 greater than or equal to 38 weeks gestation and 4 less than 38 weeks gestation ) had bilirubin levels of 4 mg / dL or greater within the first day of life .
Lack of ethnic diversity was a study limitation .
In the study population , 33 / 40 ( 83 % ) infants were Black / African American , who have a lower incidence of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia than Caucasians and Asians .
In addition , women with Rh incompatibility were excluded , as well as women who had a previous infant who developed hemolytic disease and / or had neonatal pathologic jaundice ( requiring phototherapy ) .
Additionally , of the 38 infants who had glucose samples collected in the first day of life , 3 had adequately collected serum glucose samples with values of less than 40 mg / dL that could not be attributed to maternal glucose intolerance , difficult delivery , or sepsis .
Based on prospective reports from the APR of approximately 1600 live births following exposure to atazanavir - containing regimens ( including 1037 live births in infants exposed in the first trimester and 569 exposed in second / third trimesters ) , there was no difference between atazanavir and overall birth defects compared with the background birth defect rate .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % .
Animal Data In animal reproduction studies , there was no evidence of mortality or teratogenicity in offspring born to animals at systemic drug exposure levels ( AUC ) 0 . 7 ( in rabbits ) to 1 . 2 ( in rats ) times those observed at the human clinical dose ( 300 mg / day atazanavir boosted with 100 mg / day ritonavir ) .
In pre - and postnatal development studies in the rat , atazanavir caused neonatal growth retardation during lactation that reversed after weaning .
Maternal drug exposure at this dose was 1 . 3 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical exposure .
Minimal maternal toxicity occurred at this exposure level .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV - 1 infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV - 1 .
Atazanavir has been detected in human milk .
No data are available regarding atazanavir effects on milk production .
Atazanavir was present in the milk of lactating rats and was associated with neonatal growth retardation that reversed after weaning .
Because of both the potential for HIV - 1 transmission and the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants , advise women not to breastfeed .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Atazanavir sulfate is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV - 1 infection in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older and weighing at least 15 kg .
Atazanavir sulfate is not recommended for use in pediatric patients below the age of 3 months due to the risk of kernicterus [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
All atazanavir sulfate contraindications , warnings , and precautions apply to pediatric patients [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ] .
The safety , pharmacokinetic profile , and virologic response of atazanavir sulfate in pediatric patients at least 6 years of age and older and weighing at least 15 kg were established in an open - label , multicenter clinical trial : PACTG 1020 A [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
The safety profile in pediatric patients was generally similar to that observed in adults [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
See Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) for dosing recommendations for the use of atazanavir sulfate capsules .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of atazanavir sulfate did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
Based on a comparison of mean single - dose pharmacokinetic values for Cmax and AUC , a dose adjustment based upon age is not recommended .
In general , appropriate caution should be exercised in the administration and monitoring of atazanavir sulfate in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Age / Gender A study of the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir was performed in young ( n = 29 ; 18 to 40 years ) and elderly ( n = 30 ; ≥ 65 years ) healthy subjects .
There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic differences observed due to age or gender .
8 . 7 Impaired Renal Function Atazanavir sulfate is not recommended for use in HIV - treatment - experienced patients with end - stage renal disease managed with hemodialysis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 8 Impaired Hepatic Function Atazanavir sulfate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
Atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir is not recommended in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 8 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Human experience of acute overdose with atazanavir sulfate is limited .
Single doses up to 1200 mg ( three times the 400 mg maximum recommended dose ) have been taken by healthy volunteers without symptomatic untoward effects .
A single self - administered overdose of 29 . 2 g of atazanavir sulfate in an HIV - infected patient ( 73 times the 400 - mg recommended dose ) was associated with asymptomatic bifascicular block and PR interval prolongation .
These events resolved spontaneously .
At atazanavir sulfate doses resulting in high atazanavir exposures , jaundice due to indirect ( unconjugated ) hyperbilirubinemia ( without associated liver function test changes ) or PR interval prolongation may be observed [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 8 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Treatment of overdosage with atazanavir sulfate should consist of general supportive measures , including monitoring of vital signs and ECG , and observations of the patient ’ s clinical status .
If indicated , elimination of unabsorbed atazanavir should be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage .
Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid removal of unabsorbed drug .
There is no specific antidote for overdose with atazanavir sulfate .
Since atazanavir is extensively metabolized by the liver and is highly protein bound , dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of this medicine .
11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in atazanavir sulfate capsules is atazanavir sulfate , which is an HIV - 1 protease inhibitor .
The chemical name for atazanavir sulfate is ( 3 S , 8 S , 9 S , 12 S ) - 3 , 12 - bis ( 1 , 1 - dimethylethyl ) - 8 - hydroxy - 4 , 11 - dioxo - 9 - ( phenylmethyl ) - 6 - [ [ 4 - ( 2 - pyridinyl ) phenyl ] methyl ] - 2 , 5 , 6 , 10 , 13 - pentaazatetradecanedioic acid dimethyl ester , sulfate ( 1 : 1 ) .
Atazanavir sulfate has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] C38H52N6O7 • H2SO4 M . W . 704 . 9 ( free base ) 802 . 9 ( sulfuric acid salt ) Atazanavir sulfate is a white to pale yellow crystalline powder .
It is slightly soluble in water ( 4 to 5 mg / mL , free base equivalent ) with the pH of a saturated solution in water being about 1 . 9 at 24 ± 3 ° C . Atazanavir sulfate capsules are available for oral administration in strengths containing the equivalent of 150 mg , 200 mg or 300 mg of atazanavir as atazanavir sulfate and the following inactive ingredients : crospovidone , D & C yellow # 10 aluminum lake , FD & C blue # 1 , FD & C blue # 1 aluminum lake , FD & C blue # 2 aluminum lake , FD & C red # 40 aluminum lake , gelatin , iron oxide black , lactose monohydrate , magnesium stearate , propylene glycol , shellac , sodium lauryl sulfate , sorbitan monolaurate , and titanium dioxide .
Additionally , the 300 mg capsules also contain FD & C red # 40 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Atazanavir is an HIV - 1 antiretroviral drug [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology Concentration - and dose - dependent prolongation of the PR interval in the electrocardiogram has been observed in healthy volunteers receiving atazanavir .
In a placebo - controlled study ( AI424 - 076 ) , the mean ( ± SD ) maximum change in PR interval from the predose value was 24 ( ± 15 ) msec following oral dosing with 400 mg of atazanavir ( n = 65 ) compared to 13 ( ± 11 ) msec following dosing with placebo ( n = 67 ) .
The PR interval prolongations in this study were asymptomatic .
There is limited information on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction in humans between atazanavir and other drugs that prolong the PR interval of the electrocardiogram [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Electrocardiographic effects of atazanavir were determined in a clinical pharmacology study of 72 healthy subjects .
Oral doses of 400 mg ( maximum recommended dosage ) and 800 mg ( twice the maximum recommended dosage ) were compared with placebo ; there was no concentration - dependent effect of atazanavir on the QTc interval ( using Fridericia ’ s correction ) .
In 1793 HIV - infected patients receiving antiretroviral regimens , QTc prolongation was comparable in the atazanavir and comparator regimens .
No atazanavir - treated healthy subject or HIV - infected patient in clinical trials had a QTc interval > 500 msec [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of atazanavir were evaluated in healthy adult volunteers and in HIV - infected patients after administration of atazanavir 400 mg once daily and after administration of atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily ( see Table 17 ) .

Figure 1 displays the mean plasma concentrations of atazanavir at steady state after atazanavir 400 mg once daily ( as two 200 mg capsules ) with a light meal and after atazanavir 300 mg ( as two 150 mg capsules ) with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with a light meal in HIV - infected adult patients .
Figure 1 : Mean ( SD ) Steady - State Plasma Concentrations of Atazanavir 400 mg ( n = 13 ) and 300 mg With Ritonavir ( n = 10 ) for HIV - Infected Adult Patients [ MULTIMEDIA ] Absorption Atazanavir is rapidly absorbed with a Tmax of approximately 2 . 5 hours .
Atazanavir demonstrates nonlinear pharmacokinetics with greater than dose - proportional increases in AUC and Cmax values over the dose range of 200 to 800 mg once daily .
Steady state is achieved between Days 4 and 8 , with an accumulation of approximately 2 . 3 fold .
Food Effect Administration of atazanavir sulfate with food enhances bioavailability and reduces pharmacokinetic variability .
Administration of a single 400 mg dose of atazanavir with a light meal ( 357 kcal , 8 . 2 g fat , 10 . 6 g protein ) resulted in a 70 % increase in AUC and 57 % increase in Cmax relative to the fasting state .
Administration of a single 400 mg dose of atazanavir with a high - fat meal ( 721 kcal , 37 . 3 g fat , 29 . 4 g protein ) resulted in a mean increase in AUC of 35 % with no change in Cmax relative to the fasting state .
Administration of atazanavir sulfate with either a light meal or high - fat meal decreased the coefficient of variation of AUC and Cmax by approximately one - half compared to the fasting state .
Coadministration of a single 300 mg dose of atazanavir and a 100 mg dose of ritonavir with a light meal ( 336 kcal , 5 . 1 g fat , 9 . 3 g protein ) resulted in a 33 % increase in the AUC and a 40 % increase in both the Cmax and the 24 hour concentration of atazanavir relative to the fasting state .
Coadministration with a high - fat meal ( 951 kcal , 54 . 7 g fat , 35 . 9 g protein ) did not affect the AUC of atazanavir relative to fasting conditions and the Cmax was within 11 % of fasting values .
The 24 hour concentration following a high - fat meal was increased by approximately 33 % due to delayed absorption ; the median Tmax increased from 2 . 0 to 5 . 0 hours .
Coadministration of atazanavir sulfate with ritonavir with either a light or a high - fat meal decreased the coefficient of variation of AUC and Cmax by approximately 25 % compared to the fasting state .
Distribution Atazanavir is 86 % bound to human serum proteins and protein binding is independent of concentration .
Atazanavir binds to both alpha - 1 - acid glycoprotein ( AAG ) and albumin to a similar extent ( 89 % and 86 % , respectively ) .
In a multiple - dose study in HIV - infected patients dosed with atazanavir 400 mg once daily with a light meal for 12 weeks , atazanavir was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and semen .
The cerebrospinal fluid / plasma ratio for atazanavir ( n = 4 ) ranged between 0 . 0021 and 0 . 0226 and seminal fluid / plasma ratio ( n = 5 ) ranged between 0 . 11 and 4 . 42 .
Metabolism Atazanavir is extensively metabolized in humans .
The major biotransformation pathways of atazanavir in humans consisted of monooxygenation and dioxygenation .
Other minor biotransformation pathways for atazanavir or its metabolites consisted of glucuronidation , N - dealkylation , hydrolysis , and oxygenation with dehydrogenation .
Two minor metabolites of atazanavir in plasma have been characterized .
Neither metabolite demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity .
In vitro studies using human liver microsomes suggested that atazanavir is metabolized by CYP3A .
Elimination Following a single 400 mg dose of 14 C - atazanavir , 79 % and 13 % of the total radioactivity was recovered in the feces and urine , respectively .
Unchanged drug accounted for approximately 20 % and 7 % of the administered dose in the feces and urine , respectively .
The mean elimination half - life of atazanavir in healthy volunteers ( n = 214 ) and HIV - infected adult patients ( n = 13 ) was approximately 7 hours at steady state following a dose of 400 mg daily with a light meal .
Specific Populations Renal Impairment In healthy subjects , the renal elimination of unchanged atazanavir was approximately 7 % of the administered dose .
Atazanavir sulfate has been studied in adult subjects with severe renal impairment ( n = 20 ) , including those on hemodialysis , at multiple doses of 400 mg once daily .
The mean atazanavir Cmax was 9 % lower , AUC was 19 % higher , and Cmin was 96 % higher in subjects with severe renal impairment not undergoing hemodialysis ( n = 10 ) , than in age - , weight - , and gender - matched subjects with normal renal function .
In a 4 hour dialysis session , 2 . 1 % of the administered dose was removed .
When atazanavir was administered either prior to , or following hemodialysis ( n = 10 ) , the geometric means for Cmax , AUC , and Cmin were approximately 25 % to 43 % lower compared to subjects with normal renal function .
The mechanism of this decrease is unknown .
Atazanavir sulfate is not recommended for use in HIV - treatment - experienced patients with end - stage renal disease managed with hemodialysis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) ] .
Hepatic Impairment Atazanavir sulfate has been studied in adult subjects with moderate - to - severe hepatic impairment ( 14 Child - Pugh B and 2 Child - Pugh C subjects ) after a single 400 mg dose .
The mean AUC ( 0 - ∞ ) was 42 % greater in subjects with impaired hepatic function than in healthy volunteers .
The mean half - life of atazanavir in hepatically impaired subjects was 12 . 1 hours compared to 6 . 4 hours in healthy volunteers .
A dose reduction to 300 mg is recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class B ) who have not experienced prior virologic failure as increased concentrations of atazanavir are expected .
Atazanavir sulfate is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
The pharmacokinetics of atazanavir sulfate in combination with ritonavir has not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment ; thus , coadministration of atazanavir sulfate with ritonavir is not recommended for use in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 8 ) ] .
Pediatrics The pharmacokinetic parameters for atazanavir at steady state in pediatric patients taking the capsule formulation were predicted by a population pharmacokinetic model and are summarized in Table 19 by weight ranges that correspond to the recommended doses [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .

Cmin is concentration 24 hours post - dose .
Drug Interaction Data Atazanavir is a metabolism - dependent CYP3A inhibitor , with a Kinact value of 0 . 05 to 0 . 06 min - 1 and Ki value of 0 . 84 to 1 . 0 µM .
Atazanavir is also a direct inhibitor for UGT1A1 ( Ki = 1 . 9 µM ) and CYP2C8 ( Ki = 2 . 1 µM ) .
Atazanavir has been shown in vivo not to induce its own metabolism , nor to increase the biotransformation of some drugs metabolized by CYP3A .
In a multiple - dose study , atazanavir sulfate decreased the urinary ratio of endogenous 6β - OH cortisol to cortisol versus baseline , indicating that CYP3A production was not induced .
Clinically significant interactions are not expected between atazanavir and substrates of CYP2C19 , CYP2C9 , CYP2D6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2A6 , CYP1A2 , or CYP2E1 .
Clinically significant interactions are not expected between atazanavir when administered with ritonavir and substrates of CYP2C8 .
See the complete prescribing information for ritonavir for information on other potential drug interactions with ritonavir .
Based on known metabolic profiles , clinically significant drug interactions are not expected between atazanavir and dapsone , trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole , azithromycin , or erythromycin .
Atazanavir does not interact with substrates of CYP2D6 ( e . g . , nortriptyline , desipramine , metoprolol ) .
Drug interaction studies were performed with atazanavir sulfate and other drugs likely to be coadministered and some drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interactions .
The effects of coadministration of atazanavir sulfate on the AUC , Cmax , and Cmin are summarized in Tables 21 and 22 .
Neither didanosine EC nor diltiazem had a significant effect on atazanavir exposures ( see Table 22 for effect of atazanavir on didanosine EC or diltiazem exposures ) .
Atazanavir sulfate did not have a significant effect on the exposures of didanosine ( when administered as the buffered tablet ) , stavudine , or fluconazole .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Atazanavir ( ATV ) is an azapeptide HIV - 1 protease inhibitor ( PI ) .
The compound selectively inhibits the virus - specific processing of viral Gag and Gag - Pol polyproteins in HIV - 1 infected cells , thus preventing formation of mature virions .
Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Atazanavir exhibits anti - HIV - 1 activity with a mean 50 % effective concentration ( EC50 ) in the absence of human serum of 2 to 5 nM against a variety of laboratory and clinical HIV - 1 isolates grown in peripheral blood mononuclear cells , macrophages , CEM - SS cells , and MT - 2 cells .
ATV has activity against HIV - 1 Group M subtype viruses A , B , C , D , AE , AG , F , G , and J isolates in cell culture .
ATV has variable activity against HIV - 2 isolates ( 1 . 9 to 32 nM ) , with EC50 values above the EC50 values of failure isolates .
Two - drug combination antiviral activity studies with ATV showed no antagonism in cell culture with PIs ( amprenavir , indinavir , lopinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , and saquinavir ) , NNRTIs ( delavirdine , efavirenz , and nevirapine ) , NRTIs ( abacavir , didanosine , emtricitabine , lamivudine , stavudine , tenofovir DF , and zidovudine ) , the HIV - 1 fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide , and two compounds used in the treatment of viral hepatitis , adefovir and ribavirin , without enhanced cytotoxicity .
Resistance In Cell Culture : HIV - 1 isolates with a decreased susceptibility to ATV have been selected in cell culture and obtained from patients treated with ATV or atazanavir / ritonavir ( ATV / RTV ) .
HIV - 1 isolates with 93 to 183 fold reduced susceptibility to ATV from three different viral strains were selected in cell culture by 5 months .
The substitutions in these HIV - 1 viruses that contributed to ATV resistance include I50L , N88S , I84V , A71V , and M46I .
Changes were also observed at the protease cleavage sites following drug selection .
Recombinant viruses containing the I50L substitution without other major PI substitutions were growth impaired and displayed increased susceptibility in cell culture to other PIs ( amprenavir , indinavir , lopinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , and saquinavir ) .
The I50L and I50V substitutions yielded selective resistance to ATV and amprenavir , respectively , and did not appear to be cross - resistant .

A summary of the number of virologic failures and virologic failure isolates with ATV resistance in each arm is shown in Table 23 .

Mixture of I50I / L emerged in 2 other ATV 400 mg - treated patients .
Neither isolate was phenotypically resistant to ATV .
Clinical Studies of Treatment - Naive Patients Receiving Atazanavir 300 mg With Ritonavir 100 mg : In Phase III Study AI424 - 138 , an as - treated genotypic and phenotypic analysis was conducted on samples from patients who experienced virologic failure ( HIV - 1 RNA ≥ 400 copies / mL ) or discontinued before achieving suppression on ATV / RTV ( n = 39 ; 9 % ) and LPV / RTV ( n = 39 ; 9 % ) through 96 weeks of treatment .
In the ATV / RTV arm , one of the virologic failure isolates had a 56 fold decrease in ATV susceptibility emerge on therapy with the development of PI resistance - associated substitutions L10F , V32I , K43T , M46I , A71I , G73S , I85I / V , and L90M .
The NRTI resistance - associated substitution M184V also emerged on treatment in this isolate conferring emtricitabine resistance .
Two ATV / RTV - virologic failure isolates had baseline phenotypic ATV resistance and IAS - defined major PI resistance - associated substitutions at baseline .
The I50L substitution emerged on study in one of these failure isolates and was associated with a 17 fold decrease in ATV susceptibility from baseline and the other failure isolate with baseline ATV resistance and PI substitutions ( M46M / I and I84I / V ) had additional IAS - defined major PI substitutions ( V32I , M46I , and I84V ) emerge on ATV treatment associated with a 3 fold decrease in ATV susceptibility from baseline .
Five of the treatment failure isolates in the ATV / RTV arm developed phenotypic emtricitabine resistance with the emergence of either the M184I ( n = 1 ) or the M184V ( n = 4 ) substitution on therapy and none developed phenotypic tenofovir disoproxil resistance .
In the LPV / RTV arm , one of the virologic failure patient isolates had a 69 fold decrease in LPV susceptibility emerge on therapy with the development of PI substitutions L10V , V11I , I54V , G73S , and V82A in addition to baseline PI substitutions L10L / I , V32I , I54I / V , A71I , G73G / S , V82V / A , L89V , and L90M .
Six LPV / RTV virologic failure isolates developed the M184V substitution and phenotypic emtricitabine resistance and two developed phenotypic tenofovir disoproxil resistance .
Clinical Studies of Treatment - Naive Patients Receiving Atazanavir 400 mg Without Ritonavir : ATV - resistant clinical isolates from treatment - naive patients who experienced virologic failure on atazanavir 400 mg treatment without ritonavir often developed an I50L substitution ( after an average of 50 weeks of ATV therapy ) , often in combination with an A71V substitution , but also developed one or more other PI substitutions ( e . g . , V32I , L33F , G73S , V82A , I85V , or N88S ) with or without the I50L substitution .
In treatment - naive patients , viral isolates that developed the I50L substitution , without other major PI substitutions , showed phenotypic resistance to ATV but retained in cell culture susceptibility to other PIs ( amprenavir , indinavir , lopinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , and saquinavir ) ; however , there are no clinical data available to demonstrate the effect of the I50L substitution on the efficacy of subsequently administered PIs .
Clinical Studies of Treatment - Experienced Patients : In studies of treatment - experienced patients treated with ATV or ATV / RTV , most ATV - resistant isolates from patients who experienced virologic failure developed substitutions that were associated with resistance to multiple PIs and displayed decreased susceptibility to multiple PIs .
The most common protease substitutions to develop in the viral isolates of patients who failed treatment with ATV 300 mg once daily and RTV 100 mg once daily ( together with tenofovir DF and an NRTI ) included V32I , L33F / V / I , E35D / G , M46I / L , I50L , F53L / V , I54V , A71V / T / I , G73S / T / C , V82A / T / L , I85V , and L89V / Q / M / T .
Other substitutions that developed on ATV / RTV treatment including E34K / A / Q , G48V , I84V , N88S / D / T , and L90M occurred in less than 10 % of patient isolates .
Generally , if multiple PI resistance substitutions were present in the HIV - 1 virus of the patient at baseline , ATV resistance developed through substitutions associated with resistance to other PIs and could include the development of the I50L substitution .
The I50L substitution has been detected in treatment - experienced patients experiencing virologic failure after long - term treatment .
Protease cleavage site changes also emerged on ATV treatment but their presence did not correlate with the level of ATV resistance .
Cross - Resistance Cross - resistance among PIs has been observed .
Baseline phenotypic and genotypic analyses of clinical isolates from ATV clinical trials of PI - experienced patients showed that isolates cross - resistant to multiple PIs were cross - resistant to ATV .
Greater than 90 % of the isolates with substitutions that included I84V or G48V were resistant to ATV .
Greater than 60 % of isolates containing L90M , G73S / T / C , A71V / T , I54V , M46I / L , or a change at V82 were resistant to ATV , and 38 % of isolates containing a D30N substitution in addition to other changes were resistant to ATV .
Isolates resistant to ATV were also cross - resistant to other PIs with > 90 % of the isolates resistant to indinavir , lopinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , and saquinavir , and 80 % resistant to amprenavir .
In treatment - experienced patients , PI - resistant viral isolates that developed the I50L substitution in addition to other PI resistance - associated substitution were also cross - resistant to other PIs .
Baseline Genotype / Phenotype and Virologic Outcome Analyses Genotypic and / or phenotypic analysis of baseline virus may aid in determining ATV susceptibility before initiation of ATV / RTV therapy .
An association between virologic response at 48 weeks and the number and type of primary PI resistance - associated substitutions detected in baseline HIV - 1 isolates from antiretroviral - experienced patients receiving ATV / RTV once daily or lopinavir ( LPV ) / RTV twice daily in Study AI424 - 045 is shown in Table 24 .
Overall , both the number and type of baseline PI substitutions affected response rates in treatment - experienced patients .
In the ATV / RTV group , patients had lower response rates when 3 or more baseline PI substitutions , including a substitution at position 36 , 71 , 77 , 82 , or 90 , were present compared to patients with 1 to 2 PI substitutions , including one of these substitutions .

Results should be interpreted with caution because the subgroups were small .
3 .
There were insufficient data ( n < 3 ) for PI substitutions V32I , I47V , G48V , I50V , and F53L .
The response rates of antiretroviral - experienced patients in Study AI424 - 045 were analyzed by baseline phenotype ( shift in susceptibility in cell culture relative to reference , Table 25 ) .
The analyses are based on a select patient population with 62 % of patients receiving an NNRTI - based regimen before study entry compared to 35 % receiving a PI - based regimen .
Additional data are needed to determine clinically relevant break points for atazanavir sulfate .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long - term carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats were carried out with atazanavir for two years .
In the mouse study , drug - related increases in hepatocellular adenomas were found in females at 360 mg / kg / day .
The systemic drug exposure ( AUC ) at the NOAEL ( no observable adverse effect level ) in females , ( 120 mg / kg / day ) was 2 . 8 times and in males ( 80 mg / kg / day ) was 2 . 9 times higher than those in humans at the clinical dose ( 300 mg / day atazanavir boosted with 100 mg / day ritonavir , non - pregnant patients ) .
In the rat study , no drug - related increases in tumor incidence were observed at doses up to 1200 mg / kg / day , for which AUCs were 1 . 1 ( males ) or 3 . 9 ( females ) times those measured in humans at the clinical dose .
Mutagenesis Atazanavir tested positive in an in vitro clastogenicity test using primary human lymphocytes , in the absence and presence of metabolic activation .
Atazanavir tested negative in the in vitro Ames reverse - mutation assay , in vivo micronucleus and DNA repair tests in rats , and in vivo DNA damage test in rat duodenum ( comet assay ) .
Impairment of Fertility At the systemic drug exposure levels ( AUC ) 0 . 9 ( in male rats ) or 2 . 3 ( in female rats ) times that of the human clinical dose , ( 300 mg / day atazanavir boosted with 100 mg / day ritonavir ) significant effects on mating , fertility , or early embryonic development were not observed .

14 . 2 Adult Patients with Prior Antiretroviral Therapy Study AI424 - 045 : Atazanavir sulfate once daily + ritonavir once daily compared to atazanavir sulfate once daily + saquinavir ( soft gelatin capsules ) once daily , and compared to lopinavir + ritonavir twice daily , each in combination with tenofovir DF + one NRTI .
Study AI424 - 045 was a randomized , multicenter trial comparing atazanavir ( 300 mg once daily ) with ritonavir ( 100 mg once daily ) to atazanavir ( 400 mg once daily ) with saquinavir soft gelatin capsules ( 1200 mg once daily ) , and to lopinavir + ritonavir ( 400 / 100 mg twice daily ) , each in combination with tenofovir DF and one NRTI , in 347 ( of 358 randomized ) patients who experienced virologic failure on HAART regimens containing PIs , NNRTIs , and NRTIs .
The mean time of prior exposure to antiretrovirals was 139 weeks for PIs , 85 weeks for NNRTIs , and 283 weeks for NRTIs .
The mean age was 41 years ( range : 24 to 74 ) ; 60 % were Caucasian , and 78 % were male .
The mean baseline CD4 + cell count was 338 cells / mm3 ( range : 14 to 1543 cells / mm3 ) and the mean baseline plasma HIV - 1 RNA level was 4 . 4 log10 copies / mL ( range : 2 . 6 to 5 . 88 log10 copies / mL ) .
Treatment outcomes through Week 48 for the atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir and lopinavir / ritonavir treatment arms are presented in Table 29 .
Atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir and lopinavir / ritonavir were similar for the primary efficacy outcome measure of time - averaged difference in change from baseline in HIV RNA level .
Study AI424 - 045 was not large enough to reach a definitive conclusion that atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir and lopinavir / ritonavir are equivalent on the secondary efficacy outcome measure of proportions below the HIV RNA lower limit of quantification [ see Microbiology , Tables 24 and 25 ( 12 . 4 ) ] .

5 .
Patients achieved and maintained confirmed HIV - 1 RNA < 400 copies / mL ( < 50 copies / mL ) through Week 48 .
No patients in the atazanavir sulfate / ritonavir treatment arm and three patients in the lopinavir / ritonavir treatment arm experienced a new - onset CDC Category C event during the study .
In Study AI424 - 045 , the mean change from baseline in plasma HIV - 1 RNA for atazanavir 400 mg with saquinavir ( n = 115 ) was - 1 . 55 log10 copies / mL , and the time - averaged difference in change in HIV - 1 RNA levels versus lopinavir / ritonavir was 0 . 33 .
The corresponding mean increase in CD4 + cell count was 72 cells / mm3 .
Through 48 weeks of treatment , the proportion of patients in this treatment arm with plasma HIV - 1 RNA < 400 ( < 50 ) copies / mL was 38 % ( 26 % ) .
In this study , coadministration of atazanavir sulfate and saquinavir did not provide adequate efficacy [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Study AI424 - 045 also compared changes from baseline in lipid values [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Study AI424 - 043 : Study AI424 - 043 was a randomized , open - label , multicenter trial comparing atazanavir ( 400 mg once daily ) to lopinavir / ritonavir ( 400 / 100 mg twice daily ) , each in combination with two NRTIs , in 300 patients who experienced virologic failure to only one prior PI - containing regimen .
Through 48 weeks , the proportion of patients with plasma HIV - 1 RNA < 400 ( < 50 ) copies / mL was 49 % ( 35 % ) for patients randomized to atazanavir sulfate ( n = 144 ) and 69 % ( 53 % ) for patients randomized to lopinavir / ritonavir ( n = 146 ) .
The mean change from baseline was - 1 . 59 log10 copies / mL in the atazanavir sulfate treatment arm and - 2 . 02 log10 copies / mL in the lopinavir / ritonavir arm .
Based on the results of this study , atazanavir sulfate without ritonavir was inferior to lopinavir / ritonavir in PI - experienced patients with prior virologic failure and is not recommended for such patients .
14 . 3 Pediatric Patients Pediatric Trials with Atazanavir Sulfate Capsules Assessment of the pharmacokinetics , safety , tolerability , and virologic response of atazanavir sulfate capsules was based on data from the open - label , multicenter clinical trial PACTG 1020 A which included patients from 6 years to 21 years of age .
In this study , 105 patients ( 43 antiretroviral - naive and 62 antiretroviral - experienced ) received once daily atazanavir sulfate capsule formulation , with or without ritonavir , in combination with two NRTIs .
One - hundred five ( 105 ) patients ( 6 to less than 18 years of age ) treated with the atazanavir sulfate capsule formulation , with or without ritonavir , were evaluated .
Using an ITT analysis , the overall proportions of antiretroviral - naive and - experienced patients with HIV RNA < 400 copies / mL at Week 96 were 51 % ( 22 / 43 ) and 34 % ( 21 / 62 ) , respectively .
The overall proportions of antiretroviral - naive and - experienced patients with HIV RNA < 50 copies / mL at Week 96 were 47 % ( 20 / 43 ) and 24 % ( 15 / 62 ) , respectively .
The median increase from baseline in absolute CD4 count at 96 weeks of therapy was 335 cells / mm3 in antiretroviral - naive patients and 220 cells / mm3 in antiretroviral - experienced patients .

For more information , see “ Who should not take atazanavir sulfate capsules ? ”
and “ What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking atazanavir sulfate capsules ? ”
What are atazanavir sulfate capsules ?
Atazanavir sulfate capsules are a prescription HIV - 1 ( Human Immunodeficiency Virus - type 1 ) medicine that is used with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV - 1 infection in adults and children at least 6 years of age and older and who weigh at least 15 kg .
HIV - 1 is the virus that causes AIDS ( Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ) .
Atazanavir sulfate capsules should not be used in children younger than 3 months of age .
When used with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV - 1 infection , atazanavir sulfate capsules may help : • reduce the amount of HIV - 1 in your blood .
This is called “ viral load ” .
• increase the number of CD4 + ( T ) cells in your blood that help fight off other infections .
Reducing the amount of HIV - 1 and increasing the CD4 + ( T ) cells in your blood may help improve your immune system .
This may reduce your risk of death or getting infections that can happen when your immune system is weak ( opportunistic infections ) .
Atazanavir sulfate capsules do not cure HIV - 1 infection or AIDS .
You must keep taking HIV - 1 medicines to control HIV - 1 infection and decrease HIV - related illnesses .
Who should not take atazanavir sulfate capsules ?
Do not take atazanavir sulfate capsules if you : • are allergic to atazanavir or any of the ingredients in atazanavir sulfate capsules .
See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in atazanavir sulfate capsules .
