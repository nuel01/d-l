Rx Only 32 . 8 % ( 4 mEq / mL ) 7997 mOsmol / L Calculated pH ( 6 . 0 - 7 . 0 ) ( 8 mOsmol / mL ) CAUTION : FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY MUST BE DILUTED PRIOR TO ADMINISTRATION DESCRIPTION Sodium Acetate for Injection , USP CONCENTRATE , 4 mEq / mL , is a sterile , nonpyrogenic , concentrated solution of Sodium Acetate ( C2H3NaO2 ) in Water for Injection .
It must be diluted prior to administration .
Each 50 mL vial contains 16 . 4 grams of Sodium Acetate ( anhydrous ) which provides 200 mEq each of Sodium ( Na + ) and Acetate ( CH3COO - ) .
The pH is adjusted with acetic acid and the solution contains no bacteriostatic agent or other preservative .
The solution is intended as an alternative to Sodium Chloride to provide sodium ion ( Na + ) for addition to large volume infusion fluids for intravenous use .
Unused portion should be discarded .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Sodium is the principal cation of extracellular fluids .
The sodium ion exerts a primary role in controlling total body water and its distribution .
The acetate ion is completely metabolized in the body , providing a source of hydrogen ion acceptors .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sodium Acetate for Injection , USP CONCENTRATE is indicated as a source of sodium in patients with restricted or no oral intake .
It is also useful as an additive for preparing specific intravenous fluid formulas , when the needs of the patient cannot be met by standard electrolyte or nutrient solutions .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Sodium Acetate for Injection , USP CONCENTRATE is contraindicated in patients with HYPERNATREMIA .
WARNINGS Sodium Acetate for Injection , USP CONCENTRATE must be diluted before use .
To avoid sodium overload and water retention , infuse sodium containing solutions slowly .
Do not use unless solution is clear and seal is intact .
This product contains aluminum that may be toxic .
Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired .
Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature , and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions , which contain aluminum .
Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function , including premature neonates , who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg / kg / day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity .
Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration .
PRECAUTIONS Sodium replacement therapy should be guided primarily by serum sodium level .
Use with caution in patients with renal impairment , cirrhosis , cardiac failure or other edematous or sodium retaining states .
Use in Pregnancy Safety for use in pregnancy has not been established .
Use of sodium acetate in women of childbearing potential requires that anticipated benefits be weighed against possible hazards .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Sodium overload can occur with intravenous infusion of excessive amounts of sodium containing compounds .
See WARNINGS .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Sodium Acetate for Injection , USP CONCENTRATE ( 4 mEq / mL ) , is administered intravenously only after dilution .
The dose and rate of administration are dependent upon the individual needs of the patient .
Serum sodium should be monitored as a guide to dosage .
Withdraw the calculated volume aseptically and transfer to appropriate intravenous fluids to provide the desired number of milliequivalents ( mEq ) of sodium ( Na + ) with an equal number of milliequivalents of acetate ( CH3COO - ) .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration , whenever solution and container permit .
