Manufactured by : 3 D Imaging Drug Design and Development LLC , 9015 Carti Way , Little Rock AR 72205 Distributed by : 3 D Imaging Drug Design and Development LLC , 9015 Carti Way , Little Rock AR 72205 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Glass vial containing 0 . 138 - 1 . 387 GBq ( 3 . 75 - 37 . 5 mCi / mL ) of Ammonia N 13 Injection in aqueous 0 . 9 % sodium chloride solution ( approximately 5 mL volume ) ( 3 ) .
Disposable plastic syringe ( 5 mL or 10 mL ) containing 0 . 138 - 1 . 387 GBq ( 3 . 75 - 37 . 5 mCi / mL ) of Ammonia N 13 Injection in aqueous 0 . 9 % sodium chloride solution ( approximately 5 mL volume ) ( 3 ) .
16 HOW SUPPLIED Ammonia N 13 Injection is packaged in 10 mL multiple dose glass vials or 5 or 10 mL single dose disposable plastic syringes containing between 1 . 11 GBq to 11 . 1 GBq ( 30 mCi to 300 mCi ) of [ 13 N ] ammonia , at the end of synthesis ( EOS ) reference time , in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection solution in approximately 8 mL volume .
The recommended dose of radioactivity ( 10 - 20 mCi ) is associated with a theoretical mass dose of 0 . 5 - 1 picomoles ( 8 . 47 - 16 . 94 picograms ) of Ammonia .
Package Inner and Outer Labels Outer labels are exterior to the radiation shielding for the product vial and contain the direct labeling information .
There is an inner label that can be printed and applied in advance to avoid radiation dose to the operators and is small enough to affix to the vial .
The inner label contains the product name and a batch number that positively connects it to the correct outer label .
The outer label contains complete package label information and all dose information that is determined at the time of filling .
