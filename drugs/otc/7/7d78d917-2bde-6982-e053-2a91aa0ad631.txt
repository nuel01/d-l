5 . 1 Intestinal Necrosis Cases of intestinal necrosis , some fatal , and other serious gastrointestinal adverse events ( bleeding , ischemic colitis , perforation ) have been reported in association with sodium polystyrene sulfonate use .
The majority of these cases reported the concomitant use of sorbitol .
Risk factors for gastrointestinal adverse events were present in many of the cases including prematurity , history of intestinal disease or surgery , hypovolemia , and renal insufficiency and failure .
Concomitant administration of sorbitol is not recommended .

Discontinue use in patients who develop constipation .
5 . 2 Electrolyte Disturbances Monitor serum potassium during therapy because severe hypokalemia may occur .
Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is not totally selective for potassium , and small amounts of other cations such as magnesium and calcium can also be lost during treatment .
Monitor calcium and magnesium in patients receiving sodium polystyrene sulfonate .
5 . 3 Fluid Overload in Patients Sensitive to High Sodium Intake Each 15 g dose of sodium polystyrene sulfonate contains 1500 mg ( 60 mEq ) of sodium .
Monitor patients who are sensitive to sodium intake ( heart failure , hypertension , edema ) for signs of fluid overload .
Adjustment of other sources of sodium may be required .
5 . 4 Risk of Aspiration Cases of acute bronchitis or bronchopneumonia caused by inhalation of sodium polystyrene sulfonate particles have been reported .
Patients with impaired gag reflex , altered level of consciousness , or patients prone to regurgitation may be at increased risk .
Administer sodium polystyrene sulfonate with the patient in an upright position .
5 . 5 Binding to Other Orally Administered Medications Sodium polystyrene sulfonate may bind orally administered medications , which could decrease their gastrointestinal absorption and lead to reduced efficacy .
Administer other oral medications at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after sodium polystyrene sulfonate .
Patients with gastroparesis may require a 6 hour separation [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling : • Intestinal Necrosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Electrolyte Disturbances [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 3 ) ] • Aspiration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Gastrointestinal : anorexia , constipation , diarrhea , fecal impaction , gastrointestinal concretions ( bezoars ) , ischemic colitis , nausea , ulcerations , vomiting , gastric irritation , intestinal obstruction ( due to concentration of aluminium hydroxide ) Metabolic : systemic alkalosis Adverse reactions reported include : anorexia , constipation , diarrhea , fecal impaction , gastrointestinal concretions ( bezoars ) , ischemic colitis , nausea , vomiting .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Take other orally administered drugs at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after sodium polystyrene sulfonate .
• Cation - Donating Antacids : may reduce the resin ’ s potassium exchange capability and increase risk of systemic alkalosis .
• Sorbitol : Concomitant use may contribute to the risk of intestinal necrosis and is not recommended .
7 . 1 General Interactions No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted in humans .
Sodium polystyrene sulfonate has the potential to bind other drugs .
In in vitro binding studies , sodium polystyrene sulfonate was shown to significantly bind the oral medications ( n = 6 ) that were tested .
Decreased absorption of lithium and thyroxine have also been reported with co - administration of sodium polystyrene sulfonate .
Binding of sodium polystyrene sulfonate to other oral medications could cause decreased gastrointestinal absorption and loss of efficacy when taken close to the time sodium polystyrene sulfonate is administered .
Administer sodium polystyrene sulfonate at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after other oral medications .
Patients with gastroparesis may require a 6 hour separation .
Monitor for clinical response and / or blood levels where possible .
7 . 2 Cation - Donating Antacids The simultaneous oral administration of sodium polystyrene sulfonate with nonabsorbable cation - donating antacids and laxatives may reduce the resin ' s potassium exchange capability and increase the risk of systemic alkalosis .
7 . 3 Sorbitol Sorbitol may contribute to the risk of intestinal necrosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] and concomitant use is not recommended .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is not absorbed systemically following oral or rectal administration and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal risk .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is not absorbed systemically by the mother , so breastfeeding is not expected to result in risk to the infant .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Studies of safety and efficacy have not been conducted in pediatric patients .
In pediatric patients , as in adults , sodium polystyrene sulfonate is expected to bind potassium at the practical exchange ratio of 1 mEq potassium per 1 gram of resin .
In neonates , sodium polystyrene sulfonate should not be given by the oral route .
In both children and neonates , excessive dosage or inadequate dilution could result in impaction of the resin .
Premature infants or low birth weight infants may have an increased risk for gastrointestinal adverse effects with sodium polystyrene sulfonate use [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage may result in electrolyte disturbances including hypokalemia , hypocalcemia , and hypomagnesemia .
Appropriate measures should be taken to correct serum electrolytes ( potassium , calcium , magnesium ) , and the resin should be removed from the alimentary tract by appropriate use of laxatives or enemas .
11 DESCRIPTION Sodium polystyrene sulfonate , USP is a benzene , diethenyl - polymer , with ethenylbenzene , sulfonated , sodium salt and has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The drug is a cream to light brown finely ground , powdered form of sodium polystyrene sulfonate , a cation - exchange resin prepared in the sodium phase with an in vitro exchange capacity of approximately 3 . 1 mEq ( in vivo approximately 1 mEq ) of potassium per gram .
The sodium content is approximately 100 mg ( 4 . 1 mEq ) per gram of the drug .
It can be administered orally or rectally as an enema .
One gram of sodium polystyrene sulfonate , USP contains 4 . 1 mEq of sodium .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is a non - absorbed , cation exchange polymer that contains a sodium counterion .
Sodium polystyrene sulfonate increases fecal potassium excretion through binding of potassium in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract .
Binding of potassium reduces the concentration of free potassium in the gastrointestinal lumen , resulting in a reduction of serum potassium levels .
The practical exchange ratio is 1 mEq K per 1 gram of resin .
As the resin passes along the intestine or is retained in the colon after administration by enema , the sodium ions are partially released and are replaced by potassium ions .
This action occurs primarily in the large intestine , which excretes potassium ions to a greater degree than does the small intestine .
The efficiency of this process is limited and unpredictably variable .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The effective lowering of serum potassium with sodium polystyrene sulfonate may take hours to days .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The in vivo efficiency of sodium - potassium exchange resins is approximately 33 percent ; hence , about one third of the resin ' s actual sodium content is delivered to the body .
Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is not absorbed systemically .
Drug Interactions In vitro binding studies showed that sodium polystyrene sulfonate bound significantly to the following tested drugs – warfarin , metoprolol , phenytoin , furosemide , amlodipine and amoxicillin .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Studies have not been performed .
