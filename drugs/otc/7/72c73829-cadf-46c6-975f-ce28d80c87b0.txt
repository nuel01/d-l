3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Injectable suspension : 3 . 75 mg , 11 . 25 mg , 22 . 5 mg .
Injectable suspension : 3 . 75 mg , 11 . 25 mg , 22 . 5 mg .
( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Known hypersensitivity to triptorelin or any other component of the product , or other GnRH agonists or GnRH .
( 4 ) 4 . 1 Hypersensitivity TRELSTAR is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to triptorelin or any other component of the product , or other GnRH agonists or GnRH [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypersensitivity : Anaphylactic shock , hypersensitivity , and angioedema have been reported .
In the event of a reaction , discontinue TRELSTAR and initiate appropriate medical management .
( 5 . 1 ) • Tumor Flare : Transient increase in serum testosterone levels can occur within the first few weeks of treatment .
This may worsen prostate cancer and result in spinal cord compression and urinary tract obstruction .
Monitor patients at risk and manage as appropriate .
( 5 . 2 and 5 . 3 ) • Effect on QT / QTc Interval : Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT interval .
Consider risks and benefits .
( 5 . 4 ) • Hyperglycemia and Diabetes : Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH analogs .
Monitor blood glucose level and manage according to current clinical practice .
( 5 . 5 ) • Cardiovascular Diseases : Increased risk of myocardial infarction , sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in men .
Monitor for cardiovascular disease and manage according to current clinical practice .
( 5 . 6 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic shock , hypersensitivity , and angioedema related to triptorelin administration have been reported .
In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction , therapy with TRELSTAR should be discontinued immediately and the appropriate supportive and symptomatic care should be administered .
5 . 2 Transient Increase in Serum Testosterone Initially , triptorelin , like other GnRH agonists , causes a transient increase in serum testosterone levels .
As a result , isolated cases of worsening of signs and symptoms of prostate cancer during the first weeks of treatment have been reported with GnRH agonists .
Patients may experience worsening of symptoms or onset of new symptoms , including bone pain , neuropathy , hematuria , or urethral or bladder outlet obstruction [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 3 Metastatic Vertebral Lesions and Urinary Tract Obstruction Cases of spinal cord compression , which may contribute to weakness or paralysis with or without fatal complications , have been reported with GnRH agonists .
If spinal cord compression or renal impairment develops , standard treatment of these complications should be instituted , and in extreme cases an immediate orchiectomy considered .
Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and / or with upper or lower urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy .
5 . 4 Effect on QT / QTc Interval Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT / QTc interval .
Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome , congestive heart failure , frequent electrolyte abnormalities , and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval .
Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected .
Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes .
5 . 5 Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Hyperglycemia and an increased risk of developing diabetes have been reported in men receiving GnRH agonists .
Hyperglycemia may represent development of diabetes mellitus or worsening of glycemic control in patients with diabetes .
Monitor blood glucose and / or glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) periodically in patients receiving a GnRH agonist and manage with current practice for treatment of hyperglycemia or diabetes .
5 . 6 Cardiovascular Diseases Increased risk of developing myocardial infarction , sudden cardiac death and stroke has been reported in association with use of GnRH agonists in men .
The risk appears low based on the reported odds ratios , and should be evaluated carefully along with cardiovascular risk factors when determining a treatment for patients with prostate cancer .
Patients receiving a GnRH agonist should be monitored for symptoms and signs suggestive of development of cardiovascular disease and be managed according to current clinical practice .
5 . 7 Laboratory Tests Response to TRELSTAR should be monitored by measuring serum levels of testosterone periodically or as indicated .
5 . 8 Laboratory Test Interactions Chronic or continuous administration of triptorelin in therapeutic doses results in suppression of pituitary - gonadal axis .
Diagnostic tests of the pituitary - gonadal function conducted during treatment and after cessation of therapy may therefore be misleading .
5 . 9 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal studies and mechanism of action , TRELSTAR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies , daily administration of triptorelin to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused maternal toxicity and embryo - fetal toxicities , including loss of pregnancy , at doses as low as 0 . 2 , 0 . 8 , and 8 times the estimated human daily dose based on body surface area .
Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety of the three TRELSTAR formulations was evaluated in clinical trials involving patients with advanced prostate cancer .
Mean testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week following the initial injection , declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment .
The transient increase in testosterone levels may be associated with temporary worsening of disease signs and symptoms , including bone pain , neuropathy , hematuria , and urethral or bladder outlet obstruction .
Isolated cases of spinal cord compression with weakness or paralysis of the lower extremities have occurred [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Adverse reactions reported for each of the three TRELSTAR formulations in the clinical trials , are presented in Table 2 , Table 3 , and Table 4 .
Often , causality is difficult to assess in patients with metastatic prostate cancer .
The majority of adverse reactions related to triptorelin are a result of its pharmacological action , i . e . , the induced variation in serum testosterone levels , either an increase in testosterone at the initiation of treatment , or a decrease in testosterone once castration is achieved .
Local reactions at the injection site or allergic reactions may occur .
The following adverse reactions were reported to have a possible or probable relationship to therapy as ascribed by the treating physician in at least 1 % of patients receiving TRELSTAR 3 . 75 mg .

TRELSTAR 11 . 25 mg : Decreased hemoglobin and RBC count and increased glucose , BUN , SGOT , SGPT , and alkaline phosphatase at the Day 253 visit .
TRELSTAR 22 . 5 mg : Decreased hemoglobin and increased glucose and hepatic transaminases were detected during the study .
The majority of the changes were mild to moderate .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
During postmarketing surveillance , rare cases of pituitary apoplexy ( a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland ) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin - releasing hormone agonists .
In a majority of these cases , a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose , and some within the first hour .
In these cases , pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache , vomiting , visual changes , ophthalmoplegia , altered mental status , and sometimes cardiovascular collapse .
Immediate medical attention has been required .
During postmarketing experience , convulsions , interstitial lung disease , and thromboembolic events including , but not limited to , pulmonary emboli , cerebrovascular accident , myocardial infarction , deep venous thrombosis , transient ischemic attack , and thrombophlebitis have been reported .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug - drug interaction studies involving triptorelin have been conducted .
Human pharmacokinetic data with triptorelin suggest that C - terminal fragments produced by tissue degradation are either degraded completely within tissues or are rapidly degraded further in plasma , or cleared by the kidneys .
Therefore , hepatic microsomal enzymes are unlikely to be involved in triptorelin metabolism .
However , in the absence of relevant data and as a precaution , hyperprolactinemic drugs should not be used concomitantly with triptorelin since hyperprolactinemia reduces the number of pituitary GnRH receptors .
None .
( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : TRELSTAR can cause fetal harm .
( 5 . 9 , 8 . 1 ) • Females and males of reproductive potential : TRELSTAR may impair fertility .
( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and mechanism of action , TRELSTAR can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
Expected hormonal changes that occur with TRELSTAR treatment increase the risk for pregnancy loss .
In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies , daily administration of triptorelin to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis caused maternal toxicity and embryo - fetal toxicities , including loss of pregnancy , at doses as low as 0 . 2 , 0 . 8 , and 8 times the estimated human daily dose based on body surface area .
Advise pregnant patients and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus .
Data Animal Data Studies in pregnant rats administered triptorelin at doses of 2 , 10 , and 100 mcg / kg / day ( approximately equivalent to 0 . 2 , 0 . 8 , and 8 times the estimated human daily dose based on body surface area ) during the period of organogenesis demonstrated maternal toxicity and embryo - fetal toxicities .
Embryo - fetal toxicities consisted of pre - implantation loss , increased resorption , and reduced mean number of viable fetuses at the high dose .
Teratogenic effects were not observed in viable fetuses in rats or mice .
Doses administered to mice were 2 , 20 , and 200 mcg / kg / day ( approximately equivalent to 0 . 1 , 0 . 7 , and 7 times the estimated human daily dose based on body surface area ) .
8 . 2 Lactation The safety and efficacy of TRELSTAR have not been established in females .
There are no data on the presence of triptorelin in human milk , the effects of the drug on milk production , or the effects of the drug on the breastfed child .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from TRELSTAR , a decision should be made to either discontinue breastfeeding , or discontinue the drug taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Males Based on mechanism of action , TRELSTAR may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Prostate cancer occurs primarily in an older population .
Clinical studies with TRELSTAR have been conducted primarily in patients ≥ 65 years [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Subjects with renal impairment had higher exposure than young healthy males [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Subjects with hepatic impairment had higher exposure than young healthy males [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no experience of overdosage in clinical trials .
In single dose toxicity studies in mice and rats , the subcutaneous LD50 of triptorelin was 400 mg / kg in mice and 250 mg / kg in rats , approximately 500 and 600 times , respectively , the estimated monthly human dose based on body surface area .
If overdosage occurs , therapy should be discontinued immediately and the appropriate supportive and symptomatic treatment administered .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Triptorelin is a synthetic decapeptide agonist analog of gonadotropin releasing hormone ( GnRH ) .
Comparative in vitro studies showed that triptorelin was 100 - fold more active than native GnRH in stimulating luteinizing hormone release from monolayers of dispersed rat pituitary cells in culture and 20 - fold more active than native GnRH in displacing 125 I - GnRH from pituitary receptor sites .
In animal studies , triptorelin pamoate was found to have 13 ‑ fold higher luteinizing hormone - releasing activity and 21 - fold higher follicle - stimulating hormone - releasing activity compared to the native GnRH .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Following the first administration , there is a transient surge in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , follicle - stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , testosterone , and estradiol [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
After chronic and continuous administration , usually 2 to 4 weeks after initiation of therapy , a sustained decrease in LH and FSH secretion and marked reduction of testicular steroidogenesis are observed .
A reduction of serum testosterone concentration to a level typically seen in surgically castrated men is obtained .
Consequently , the result is that tissues and functions that depend on these hormones for maintenance become quiescent .
These effects are usually reversible after cessation of therapy .
Following a single intramuscular injection of TRELSTAR : TRELSTAR 3 . 75 mg : serum testosterone levels first increased , peaking on Day 4 , and declined thereafter to low levels by Week 4 in healthy male volunteers .
TRELSTAR 11 . 25 mg : serum testosterone levels first increased , peaking on Days 2 – 3 , and declined thereafter to low levels by Weeks 3 – 4 in men with advanced prostate cancer .
TRELSTAR 22 . 5 mg : serum testosterone levels first increased , peaking on Day 3 , and declined thereafter to low levels by Weeks 3 – 4 in men with advanced prostate cancer .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Results of pharmacokinetic investigations conducted in healthy men indicate that after intravenous bolus administration , triptorelin is distributed and eliminated according to a 3 - compartment model and corresponding half - lives are approximately 6 minutes , 45 minutes , and 3 hours .
Absorption Following a single intramuscular injection of TRELSTAR to patients with prostate cancer , mean peak serum concentrations of 28 . 4 ng / mL , 38 . 5 ng / mL , and 44 . 1 ng / mL occurred in 1 to 3 hours after the 3 . 75 mg , 11 . 25 mg , and 22 . 5 mg formulations , respectively .
Triptorelin did not accumulate over 9 months ( 3 . 75 mg and 11 . 25 mg ) or 12 months ( 22 . 5 mg ) of treatment .
Distribution The volume of distribution following a single intravenous bolus dose of 0 . 5 mg of triptorelin peptide was 30 – 33 L in healthy male volunteers .
There is no evidence that triptorelin , at clinically relevant concentrations , binds to plasma proteins .
Elimination Metabolism The metabolism of triptorelin in humans is unknown , but is unlikely to involve hepatic microsomal enzymes ( cytochrome P - 450 ) .
The effect of triptorelin on the activity of other drug metabolizing enzymes is also unknown .
Thus far , no metabolites of triptorelin have been identified .
Pharmacokinetic data suggest that C - terminal fragments produced by tissue degradation are either completely degraded in the tissues , or rapidly degraded in plasma , or cleared by the kidneys .
Excretion Triptorelin is eliminated by both the liver and the kidneys .
Following intravenous administration of 0 . 5 mg triptorelin peptide to six healthy male volunteers with a creatinine clearance of 149 . 9 mL / min , 41 . 7 % of the dose was excreted in urine as intact peptide with a total triptorelin clearance of 211 . 9 mL / min .
This percentage increased to 62 . 3 % in patients with liver disease who have a lower creatinine clearance ( 89 . 9 mL / min ) .
It has also been observed that the nonrenal clearance of triptorelin ( patient anuric , CIcreat = 0 ) was 76 . 2 mL / min , thus indicating that the nonrenal elimination of triptorelin is mainly dependent on the liver .
Special Populations Age and Race The effects of age and race on triptorelin pharmacokinetics have not been systematically studied .
However , pharmacokinetic data obtained in young healthy male volunteers aged 20 to 22 years with an elevated creatinine clearance ( approximately 150 mL / min ) indicate that triptorelin was eliminated twice as fast in this young population as compared with patients with moderate renal insufficiency .
This is related to the fact that triptorelin clearance is partly correlated to total creatinine clearance , which is well known to decrease with age [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) and ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Pediatric TRELSTAR has not been evaluated in patients less than 18 years of age [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Hepatic and Renal Impairment After an intravenous bolus injection of 0 . 5 mg triptorelin , the two distribution half - lives were unaffected by renal and hepatic impairment .
However , renal insufficiency led to a decrease in total triptorelin clearance proportional to the decrease in creatinine clearance as well as increases in volume of distribution and consequently , an increase in elimination half - life ( see Table 6 ) .
In subjects with hepatic insufficiency , a decrease in triptorelin clearance was more pronounced than that observed with renal insufficiency .
Due to minimal increases in the volume of distribution , the elimination half - life in subjects with hepatic insufficiency was similar to subjects with renal insufficiency .
Subjects with renal or hepatic impairment had 2 ‑ to 4 - fold higher exposure ( AUC values ) than young healthy males [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) and ( 8 . 7 ) ] .

The incidences of benign and malignant pituitary tumors and histiosarcomas were increased in a dose - related manner .
No oncogenic effect was observed in mice administered triptorelin for 18 months at doses up to 6000 mcg / kg every 28 days ( approximately 8 times the human monthly dose based on body surface area ) .
Mutagenicity studies performed with triptorelin using bacterial and mammalian systems ( in vitro Ames test and chromosomal aberration test in CHO cells and an in vivo mouse micronucleus test ) provided no evidence of mutagenic potential .
After 60 days of subcutaneous treatment followed by a minimum of four estrus cycles prior to mating , triptorelin , at doses of 2 , 20 , and 200 mcg / kg / day in saline ( approximately 0 . 2 , 2 , and 16 times the estimated human daily dose based on body surface area ) or 2 monthly injections as slow release microspheres ( ~ 20 mcg / kg / day ) , had no effect on the fertility or general reproductive function of female rats .
No studies were conducted to assess the effect of triptorelin on male fertility .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES TRELSTAR 3 . 75 mg TRELSTAR 3 . 75 mg was studied in a randomized , active control trial of 277 men with advanced prostate cancer .
The clinical trial population consisted of 59 . 9 % Caucasian , 39 . 3 % Black , and 0 . 8 % Other .
There was no difference observed with triptorelin response between racial groups .
Men were between 47 and 89 years of age ( mean = 71 years ) .
Patients received either TRELSTAR 3 . 75 mg ( N = 140 ) or an approved GnRH agonist monthly for 9 months .
The primary efficacy endpoints were both achievement of castration by Day 29 and maintenance of castration from Day 57 through Day 253 .
Castration levels of serum testosterone ( ≤ 1 . 735 nmol / L ; equivalent to 50 ng / dL ) in patients treated with TRELSTAR 3 . 75 mg were achieved at Day 29 in 125 of 137 ( 91 . 2 % ) patients and at Day 57 in 97 . 7 % of patients .
Maintenance of castration levels of serum testosterone from Day 57 through Day 253 was found in 96 . 2 % of patients treated with TRELSTAR 3 . 75 mg .
The presence of an acute - on - chronic flare phenomenon was also studied as a secondary efficacy endpoint .
Serum LH levels were measured at 2 hours after repeat TRELSTAR 3 . 75 mg administration on Days 85 and 169 .
One hundred twenty - four of the 126 evaluable patients ( 98 . 4 % ) on Day 85 had a serum LH level of ≤ 1 . 0 IU / L at 2 hours after dosing , indicating desensitization of the pituitary gonadotroph receptors .
TRELSTAR 11 . 25 mg TRELSTAR 11 . 25 mg was studied in a randomized , active control trial of 346 men with advanced prostate cancer .
The clinical trial population consisted of 48 % Caucasian , 38 % Black , and 15 % Other .
There was no difference observed with triptorelin response between racial groups .
Men were between 45 and 96 years of age ( mean = 71 years ) .
Patients received either TRELSTAR 11 . 25 mg ( N = 174 ) every 12 weeks for a total of up to 3 doses ( maximum treatment period of 253 days ) or TRELSTAR 3 . 75 mg ( N = 172 ) every 28 days for a total of up to 9 doses .
The primary efficacy endpoints were both achievement of castration by Day 29 and maintenance of castration from Day 57 through Day 253 .
Castration levels of serum testosterone ( ≤ 1 . 735 nmol / L ; equivalent to 50 ng / dL ) were achieved at Day 29 in 167 of 171 ( 97 . 7 % ) patients treated with TRELSTAR 11 . 25 mg , and maintenance of castration levels of serum testosterone from Day 57 through Day 253 was found in 94 . 4 % of patients treated with TRELSTAR 11 . 25 mg .
TRELSTAR 22 . 5 mg TRELSTAR 22 . 5 mg was studied in a non - comparative trial of 120 men with advanced prostate cancer .
The clinical trial population consisted of 64 % Caucasian , 23 % Black , and 13 % Other , with a mean age of 71 . 1 years ( range 51 - 93 ) .
Patients received TRELSTAR 22 . 5 mg ( N = 120 ) every 24 weeks for a total of 2 doses ( maximum treatment period of 337 days ) .
The primary efficacy endpoints included achievement of castration by Day 29 and maintenance of castration from Day 57 through Day 337 .
Castration levels of serum testosterone ( ≤ 1 . 735 nmol / L ; equivalent to 50 ng / dL ) were achieved at Day 29 in 97 . 5 % ( 117 of 120 ) of patients treated with TRELSTAR 22 . 5 mg .
Castration was maintained in 93 . 3 % of patients in the period from Day 57 to Day 337 .
