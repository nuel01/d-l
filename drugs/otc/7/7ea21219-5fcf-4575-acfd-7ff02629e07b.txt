Consider other antidiabetic therapies in patients with a history of pancreatitis .
( 5 . 2 ) • Never share ADLYXIN pen between patients , even if the needle is changed .
( 5 . 3 ) • Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin : Patients taking an insulin secretagogue or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia , including severe hypoglycemia .
Reduction in the dose of insulin secretagogues or insulin may be necessary .
( 5 . 4 ) • Acute Kidney Injury : Monitor renal function in patients with renal impairment reporting severe adverse gastrointestinal reactions .
ADLYXIN is not recommended in patients with end stage renal disease .
( 5 . 5 ) • Immunogenicity : Patients may develop antibodies to lixisenatide .
If there is worsening glycemic control or failure to achieve targeted glycemic control , significant injection site reactions or allergic reactions , alternative antidiabetic therapy should be considered .
( 5 . 6 ) • Acute Gallbladder Disease : If cholelithiasis or cholecystitis are suspected , gallbladder studies are indicated .
( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Anaphylaxis and Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions In clinical trials of ADLYXIN , there have been cases of anaphylaxis determined to be related to ADLYXIN ( frequency of 0 . 1 % or 10 cases per 10 , 000 patient - years ) .
Other serious hypersensitivity reactions including angioedema also occurred [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Inform and closely monitor patients with a history of anaphylaxis or angioedema with another GLP - 1 receptor agonist for allergic reactions , because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to anaphylaxis with ADLYXIN .
ADLYXIN is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to lixisenatide [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs , the patient should discontinue ADLYXIN and promptly seek medical attention .
5 . 2 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis , including fatal and nonfatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis , has been reported postmarketing in patients treated with GLP - 1 receptor agonists .
In clinical trials of ADLYXIN , there were 21 cases of pancreatitis among ADLYXIN - treated patients and 14 cases in comparator - treated patients ( incidence rate of 21 vs . 17 per 10 , 000 patient - years ) .
ADLYXIN cases were reported as acute pancreatitis ( n = 3 ) , pancreatitis ( n = 12 ) , chronic pancreatitis ( n = 5 ) , and edematous pancreatitis ( n = 1 ) .
Some patients had risk factors for pancreatitis , such as a history of cholelithiasis or alcohol abuse .
After initiation of ADLYXIN , observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis ( including persistent severe abdominal pain , sometimes radiating to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting ) .
If pancreatitis is suspected , promptly discontinue ADLYXIN and initiate appropriate management .
If pancreatitis is confirmed , do not restart ADLYXIN .
Consider antidiabetic therapies other than ADLYXIN in patients with a history of pancreatitis .
5 . 3 Never Share ADLYXIN Pen Between Patients ADLYXIN pens should never be shared between patients , even if the needle is changed .
Pen - sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood - borne pathogens .
5 . 4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin Patients receiving ADLYXIN in combination with basal insulin or insulin secretagogue ( e . g . , sulfonylurea ) have an increased risk of hypoglycemia , including severe hypoglycemia .
In patients receiving sulfonylurea with or without metformin , 14 . 5 % patients on ADLYXIN reported symptomatic hypoglycemia compared to 10 . 6 % for those on placebo .
In patients receiving basal insulin with or without metformin , 28 . 3 % patients on ADLYXIN reported symptomatic hypoglycemia compared to 23 . 0 % for those on placebo .
In patients receiving basal insulin with sulfonylurea , 47 . 2 % patients on ADLYXIN reported symptomatic hypoglycemia compared to 21 . 6 % for those on placebo [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of sulfonylurea ( or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues ) or insulin .
Inform patients using these concomitant medications of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 5 Acute Kidney Injury Acute kidney injury and worsening of chronic renal failure , which may sometimes require hemodialysis has been reported postmarketing in patients treated with ADLYXIN .
Some of these events were reported in patients without known underlying renal disease .
A majority of the reported events occurred in patients who had experienced nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or dehydration .
Monitor renal function when initiating or escalating doses of ADLYXIN in patients with renal impairment and in patients reporting severe gastrointestinal reactions .
ADLYXIN is not recommended in patients with end stage renal disease [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
5 . 6 Immunogenicity Patients may develop antibodies to lixisenatide following treatment with ADLYXIN .
A pooled analysis of studies of lixisenatide - treated patients showed that 70 % were antibody positive at Week 24 .
In the subset of patients ( 2 . 4 % ) with the highest antibody concentrations ( > 100 nmol / L ) , an attenuated glycemic response was observed .
A higher incidence of allergic reactions and injection site reactions occurred in antibody positive patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
If there is worsening glycemic control or failure to achieve targeted glycemic control , significant injection site reactions or allergic reactions , alternative antidiabetic therapy should be considered [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 7 Acute Gallbladder Disease Acute events of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP - 1 receptor agonist trials and postmarketing .
In the ELIXA study [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 6 ) ] , cholelithiasis occurred in 0 . 4 % of ADLYXIN - treated patients versus 0 . 2 % in placebo - treated patients and acute cholecystitis in 0 . 3 % of ADLYXIN - treated patients versus 0 . 2 % in placebo - treated patients .
If cholelithiasis is suspected , gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow - up are indicated .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious reactions are described below or elsewhere in the prescribing information : • Anaphylaxis and Serious Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Pancreatitis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Renal Failure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Immunogenicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Acute Gallbladder Disease [ see Warnings and Precautions 5 . 7 ) ] The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 5 % ) of patients treated with ADLYXIN are nausea , vomiting , headache , diarrhea , dizziness , and hypoglycemia .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Pool of Placebo - Controlled Trials The data in Table 1 are derived from the placebo - controlled trials [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
These data reflect exposure of 2869 patients to ADLYXIN and a mean duration of exposure to ADLYXIN of 21 . 7 weeks .
Across the treatment arms , the mean age of patients was 56 . 1 years , 2 . 3 % were 75 years or older and 48 . 2 % were male .
The population in these studies was 63 . 7 % White , 2 . 6 % Black or African American , 32 . 0 % Asian , and 18 . 9 % were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity .
At baseline , the population had diabetes for an average of 8 . 2 years and had a mean HbA1c of 8 . 1 % .
At baseline , 11 . 2 % of the population reported retinopathy .
Baseline estimated renal function was normal or mildly impaired ( eGFR ≥ 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) in 95 . 3 % of the pooled study populations .
Table 1 shows common adverse reactions , excluding hypoglycemia , associated with the use of ADLYXIN in the pool of placebo - controlled trials .
These adverse reactions were not present at baseline , occurred more commonly on ADLYXIN than on placebo , and occurred in at least 5 % of patients treated with ADLYXIN .
Table 1 : Adverse Reactions Reported in ≥ 5 % of ADLYXIN - Treated Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Occurring More Frequently Compared to Placebo Adverse Reaction Placebo ( N = 1639 ) ADLYXIN ( N = 2869 ) * hypoglycemia is discussed separately .
Nausea 6 % 25 % Vomiting 2 % 10 % Headache 6 % 9 % Diarrhea 6 % 8 % Dizziness 4 % 7 % Gastrointestinal adverse reactions In the pool of placebo - controlled trials , gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred more frequently among patients receiving ADLYXIN than placebo ( placebo 18 . 4 % , ADLYXIN 39 . 7 % ) .
More patients receiving ADLYXIN ( 4 . 3 % ) discontinued treatment due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions than patients receiving placebo ( 0 . 5 % ) .
Investigators graded the severity of gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurring on ADLYXIN as " mild " in 64 . 2 % of cases , " moderate " in 32 . 3 % of cases , or " severe " in 3 . 5 % of cases .
The majority of these adverse reactions occurred during the first 3 weeks after starting treatment .
In addition to the reactions in Table 1 , the following adverse reactions were reported in > 2 % of patients and more frequently in ADLYXIN - treated patients than placebo ( frequencies listed , respectively , as : placebo ; ADLYXIN ) : dyspepsia ( 0 . 2 % , 3 . 2 % ) , constipation ( 1 . 8 % , 2 . 8 % ) , abdominal distension ( 0 . 9 % , 2 . 2 % ) , abdominal pain upper ( 0 . 9 % , 2 . 2 % ) , abdominal pain ( 1 . 5 % , 2 . 0 % ) .
Hypoglycemia Symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with clinical symptoms that were considered to result from a hypoglycemic episode with an accompanying plasma glucose < 60 mg / dL or associated with prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate , intravenous glucose , or glucagon administration if no plasma glucose value was available .
Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia was defined as an event with clinical symptoms that were considered to result from hypoglycemia in which the patient required the assistance of another person , associated with a plasma glucose level below 36 mg / dL or , associated with prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate , intravenous glucose , or glucagon administration if no plasma glucose was available .
Table 2 summarizes the incidence of symptomatic hypoglycemia and severe hypoglycemia in seven placebo - controlled efficacy / safety studies .
Table 2 : Incidence ( % ) of Symptomatic Hypoglycemia and Severe Hypoglycemia in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus during the 24 - week Main Treatment Period Background Therapy Placebo ADLYXIN Monotherapy [ 1 ] N = 122 N = 239 Symptomatic ( % ) 2 2 Severe ( % ) 0 0 With Metformin N = 432 N = 946 Symptomatic ( % ) 1 3 Severe ( % ) 0 0 With Sulfonylurea + / - metformin N = 377 N = 656 Symptomatic ( % ) 11 15 Severe ( % ) 0 0 . 2 With Pioglitazone + / - metformin N = 161 N = 323 Symptomatic ( % ) 1 3 Severe ( % ) 0 0 With Basal insulin + / - metformin N = 213 N = 374 Symptomatic ( % ) 23 28 Severe ( % ) 0 1 With Basal insulin + / - sulfonylurea N = 111 N = 108 Symptomatic ( % ) 22 47 Severe ( % ) 0 0 With Insulin Glargine and metformin + / - thiazolidinedione N = 223 N = 223 Symptomatic ( % ) 14 22 Severe ( % ) 0 0 . 4 [ 1 ] 12 - week treatment duration .
Injection site reactions Injections site reactions ( e . g . , pain , pruritus , and erythema ) were reported more frequently in ADLYXIN - treated patients ( 4 % ) than placebo treated patients ( 2 % ) .
Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity In the ADLYXIN development program anaphylaxis cases were adjudicated .
Anaphylaxis was defined as a skin or mucosal lesion of acute onset associated with at least 1 other organ system involvement .
Symptoms such as hypotension , laryngeal edema or severe bronchospasm could be present but were not required for the case definition .
More cases adjudicated as meeting the definition for anaphylaxis occurred in ADLYXIN - treated patients ( incidence rate of 0 . 2 % or 16 cases per 10 , 000 patient years ) than placebo treated patient ( incidence rate of 0 . 1 % or 7 cases per 10 , 000 patient years ) .
Allergic reactions ( such as anaphylactic reaction , angioedema and urticaria ) adjudicated as possibly related to the study medication were observed more frequently in ADLYXIN - treated patients ( 0 . 4 % ) than placebo - treated patient ( 0 . 2 % ) .
Acute Gallbladder Disease In the ELIXA study [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 6 ) ] , cholelithiasis occurred in 0 . 4 % of ADLYXIN - treated patients versus 0 . 2 % in placebo - treated patients and acute cholecystitis in 0 . 3 % of ADLYXIN - treated patients versus 0 . 2 % in placebo - treated patients .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity In the pool of 9 placebo - controlled studies , 70 % of patients exposed to lixisenatide tested positive for anti - lixisenatide antibodies during the trials .
In the subset of patients ( 2 . 4 % ) with the highest antibody concentrations ( > 100 nmol / L ) , an attenuated glycemic response was observed .
A higher incidence of allergic reactions and injection site reactions occurred in antibody positive patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
Anti - lixisenatide antibody characterization studies have demonstrated the potential for development of antibodies cross - reactive with endogenous GLP - 1 and glucagon , but the clinical significance of these antibodies is not currently known .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , the incidence of antibodies to lixisenatide cannot be directly compared with the incidence of antibodies with other products .
6 . 3 Post - Marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been reported during post - approval use of ADLYXIN .
Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Hepatobiliary : cholecystitis , cholelithiasis requiring cholecystectomy 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • ADLYXIN delays gastric emptying which may impact absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications .
Oral medications that are particularly dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy , such as antibiotics , or medications for which a delay in effect is undesirable , such as acetaminophen , should be administered 1 hour before ADLYXIN .
( 7 . 1 , 12 . 3 ) • Oral contraceptives should be taken at least 1 hour before ADLYXIN administration or 11 hours after the dose of ADLYXIN .
( 7 . 1 , 12 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Delayed Gastric Emptying Effects on Oral Medications ADLYXIN delays gastric emptying which may reduce the rate of absorption of orally administered medications .
Use caution when coadministering oral medications that have a narrow therapeutic ratio or that require careful clinical monitoring .
These medications should be adequately monitored when concomitantly administered with ADLYXIN .
If such medications are to be administered with food , patients should be advised to take them with a meal or snack when ADLYXIN is not administered .
Oral medications that are particularly dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy , such as antibiotics , or medications for which a delay in effect is undesirable , such as acetaminophen , should be administered at least 1 hour before ADLYXIN injection [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Patients taking oral contraceptives should be advised to take them at least 1 hour before ADLYXIN administration or at least 11 hours after the dose of ADLYXIN [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Dosage Adjustment of Sulfonylurea or Insulin with Concomitant Use with ADLYXIN When initiating ADLYXIN , consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues ( such as sulfonylureas ) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : ADLYXIN should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
( 8 . 1 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with lixisenatide in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug - associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage .
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
Based on animal reproduction studies , there may be risks to the fetus from exposure to lixisenatide during pregnancy .
ADLYXIN should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Lixisenatide administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis was associated with visceral closure and skeletal defects at systemic exposures that decreased maternal food intake and weight gain during gestation , and that are 1 - time and 6 - times higher than the 20 mcg / day clinical dose , respectively , based on plasma AUC [ see Data ] .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 – 10 % in women with pregestational diabetes with a HbA1c > 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 % – 25 % in women with a HbA1c > 10 .
The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % – 4 % and 15 % – 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis , pre - eclampsia , spontaneous abortions , preterm delivery , and delivery complications .
Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects , stillbirth , and macrosomia related morbidity .
Data Animal data In pregnant rats receiving twice daily subcutaneous doses of 2 . 5 , 35 , or 500 mcg / kg during organogenesis ( gestation day 6 to 17 ) , fetuses were present with visceral closure defects ( e . g . , microphthalmia , bilateral anophthalmia , diaphragmatic hernia ) and stunted growth .
Impaired ossification associated with skeletal malformations ( e . g . , bent limbs , scapula , clavicle , and pelvis ) were observed at ≥ 5 mcg / kg / day , resulting in systemic exposure that is 1 - time the 20 mcg / day clinical dose , based on plasma AUC .
Decreases in maternal body weight , food consumption , and motor activity were observed concurrent with the adverse fetal findings , which confounds the interpretation of relevance of these malformations to the human risk assessment .
Placental transfer of lixisenatide to developing rat fetuses is low with a concentration ratio in fetal / maternal plasma of 0 . 1 % .
In pregnant rabbits receiving twice daily subcutaneous doses of 2 . 5 , 25 , 250 mcg / kg during organogenesis ( gestation day 6 to 18 ) , fetuses were present with multiple visceral and skeletal malformations , including closure defects , at ≥ 5 mcg / kg / day or systemic exposures that are 6 - times the 20 mcg / day clinical dose , based on plasma AUC .
Decreases in maternal body weight , food consumption , and motor activity were observed concurrent with the fetal findings , which confounds the interpretation of relevance of these malformations to the human risk assessment .
Placental transfer of lixisenatide to developing rabbit fetuses is low with a concentration ratio in fetal / maternal plasma of ≤ 0 . 3 % .
In a second study in pregnant rabbits , no drug - related malformations were observed from twice daily subcutaneous doses of 0 . 15 , 1 . 0 , and 2 . 5 mcg / kg administered during organogenesis , resulting in systemic exposures up to 9 - times the clinical exposure at 20 mcg / day , based on plasma AUC .
In pregnant rats given twice daily subcutaneous doses of 2 , 20 , or 200 mcg / kg from gestation day 6 through lactation , decreases in maternal body weight , food consumption , motor activity were observed at all doses .
Skeletal malformations and increased pup mortality were observed at 400 mcg / kg / day , which is approximately 200 - times the 20 mcg / day clinical dose , based on mcg / m2 .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of ADLYXIN in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
However , lixisenatide is present in rat milk [ see Data ] .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for lixisenatide and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from lixisenatide or from the underlying maternal condition .
Data Animal data A study in lactating rats showed low ( 9 . 4 % ) transfer of lixisenatide and its metabolites into milk and negligible ( 0 . 01 % ) levels of unchanged lixisenatide protein in the gastric contents of weaning offspring .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ADLYXIN have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In clinical studies of ADLYXIN , a total of 1837 ( 25 % ) of the patients exposed to the study medication were 65 years of age and over and 288 ( 4 % ) were 75 years of age and over .
No overall differences were observed in safety or effectiveness between these patients and younger patients , but individual sensitivity cannot be ruled out .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment In patients with mild renal impairment ( eGFR : 60 – 89 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) no dose adjustment is required [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] but close monitoring for ADLYXIN related adverse reactions [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] and for changes in renal function is recommended because a higher incidence of hypoglycemia , nausea and vomiting were observed in these patients .
In a cardiovascular outcome study , 655 ( 22 % ) lixisenatide treated patients had moderate renal impairment ( eGFR : 30 to less than 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) .
No dosing adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] but close monitoring for ADLYXIN related adverse gastrointestinal reactions [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] and for changes in renal function is recommended because these may lead to dehydration and acute renal failure and worsening of chronic failure in these patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Clinical experience in patients with severe renal impairment is limited as there were only 5 patients with severe renal impairment ( eGFR 15 to less than 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) exposed to ADLYXIN in all controlled studies .
Lixisenatide exposure was higher in these patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Patients with severe renal impairment exposed to ADLYXIN should be closely monitored for occurrence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions and for changes in renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
There is no therapeutic experience in patients with end stage renal disease ( eGFR < 15 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , and it is not recommended to use ADLYXIN in this population [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Patients with Gastroparesis ADLYXIN slows gastric emptying .
Patients with preexisting gastroparesis were excluded from clinical trials of ADLYXIN .
ADLYXIN should not be initiated in patients with severe gastroparesis .
10 OVERDOSAGE In case of overdose , appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient ' s clinical signs and symptoms .
11 DESCRIPTION Lixisenatide is a synthetic analogue of human GLP - 1 and acts as a GLP - 1 receptor agonist .
Lixisenatide is a protein containing 44 amino acids , which is amidated at the C - terminal amino acid ( position 44 ) and has a molecular weight of 4 . 8585 kDa .
ADLYXIN ( lixisenatide ) injection is a sterile , clear and colorless solution for subcutaneous use .
ADLYXIN is supplied as 3 mL single - patient - use prefilled pens .
Each mL contains either 50 mcg of lixisenatide ( green prefilled pen ) or 100 mcg of lixisenatide ( burgundy prefilled pen ) and the inactive ingredients : glycerol 85 % ( 54 mg ) , metacresol ( 8 . 1 mg ) , methionine ( 9 . 0 mg ) , sodium acetate trihydrate ( 10 . 5 mg ) , and Water for Injection , USP .
Hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust pH . The pH is approximately 4 . 5 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Lixisenatide is a GLP - 1 receptor agonist .
Lixisenatide increases glucose - dependent insulin release , decreases glucagon secretion , and slows gastric emptying .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In a clinical pharmacology study in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus , ADLYXIN reduced fasting plasma glucose and postprandial blood glucose AUC0 – 300 min compared to placebo ( - 33 . 8 mg / dL and - 387 mg ∙ h / dL , respectively ) following a standardized test meal .
The effect on postprandial blood glucose AUC was most notable with the first meal , and the effect was attenuated with later meals in the day .
Glucagon Secretion Treatment with ADLYXIN 20 mcg once daily reduced postprandial glucagon levels ( AUC0 – 300 min ) compared to placebo by - 15 . 6 h ∙ pmol / L after a standardized test meal in patients with type 2 diabetes .
Cardiac Electrophysiology ( QTc ) At a dose 1 . 5 times the recommended dose , ADLYXIN does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent .
Heart Rate No increase in mean heart rate was seen in placebo - controlled studies .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following subcutaneous administration in patients with type 2 diabetes , the median tmax is 1 to 3 . 5 hours .
There are no clinically relevant differences in the rate of absorption when lixisenatide is administered subcutaneously in the abdomen , thigh , or arm .
Distribution The apparent volume of distribution after subcutaneous administration of lixisenatide ( Vz / F ) is approximately 100 L . Elimination Metabolism and elimination Lixisenatide is presumed to be eliminated through glomerular filtration , and proteolytic degradation .
After multiple dose administration in patients with type 2 diabetes , mean terminal half - life was approximately 3 hours and the mean apparent clearance ( CL / F ) about 35 L / h .
Specific Populations Effects of age , body weight , gender , and race Age , body weight , gender , and race were not observed to meaningfully affect the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide in population PK analyses [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Renal impairment Compared to healthy subjects ( Creatinine Clearance using Cockcroft - Gault [ CLcr ] greater than or equal to 90 mL / min [ N = 4 ] ) , plasma Cmax of lixisenatide was increased by approximately 60 % , 42 % , and 83 % in patients with mild ( CLcr 60 – 89 mL / min [ N = 9 ] ) , moderate ( CLcr 30 – 59 mL / min [ N = 11 ] ) , and severe ( CLcr 15 – 29 mL / min [ N = 8 ] ) renal impairment .
Plasma AUC was increased by approximately 34 % , 69 % , and 124 % with mild , moderate , and severe renal impairment , respectively [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Hepatic impairment No pharmacokinetic study has been performed in patients with acute or chronic hepatic impairment .
Hepatic dysfunction is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of lixisenatide .
Drug Interaction Studies Acetaminophen ADLYXIN 10 mcg did not change the overall exposure ( AUC ) of acetaminophen following administration of a single dose of acetaminophen 1000 mg , whether before or after ADLYXIN .
No effects on acetaminophen Cmax and tmax were observed when acetaminophen was administered 1 hour before ADLYXIN .
When administered 1 or 4 hours after 10 mcg of ADLYXIN , Cmax of acetaminophen was decreased by 29 % and 31 % , respectively , and median tmax was delayed by 2 . 0 and 1 . 75 hours , respectively .

A statistically significant increase in thyroid C - cell adenomas was observed in male mice at 2 , 000 mcg / kg / day , resulting in systemic exposures that are > 180 - times the human exposure achieved at 20 mcg / day based on plasma AUC .
Statistically significant increases in thyroid C - cell adenomas were seen at all doses in rats , resulting in systemic exposures that are ≥ 15 - times the human exposure achieved at 20 mcg / day based on plasma AUC .
A numerical increase in thyroid C - cell carcinomas was observed in rats at ≥ 400 mcg / kg / day , resulting in systemic exposures that are > 56 - times the human exposure achieved at 20 mcg / day based on plasma AUC .
Mutagenesis Lixisenatide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a standard battery of genotoxicity tests ( bacterial mutagenicity ( Ames ) , human lymphocyte chromosome aberration , mouse bone marrow micronucleus ) .
Impairment of Fertility Studies in which male and female rats received twice daily subcutaneous doses of 2 , 29 , or 414 mcg / kg / dose prior to pairing through gestation day 6 did not indicate any adverse effects on male or female fertility in rats up to the highest dose tested , 414 mcg / kg / dose , which is approximately 400 - times the clinical dose at 20 mcg / day based on mcg / m2 .

The primary composite endpoint was the time to the first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event or MACE + , defined as any of the following positively adjudicated events : Cardiovascular death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , or nonfatal stroke , or hospitalization for unstable angina .
The study was designed as a noninferiority trial with a prespecified risk margin of 1 . 3 for the hazard ratio comparing ADLYXIN to placebo .
Overall , 6068 patients were randomized 1 : 1 to either placebo or ADLYXIN 20 mcg ( following a starting dose of 10 mcg during the first 2 weeks ) and were included in the primary analyses .
The demographics and baseline characteristics were well - balanced between treatments .
The median age at study entry was 60 years .
Approximately 69 % of the patients were males and 75 % were Caucasian .
The majority of patients were either obese or overweight with a median BMI of 29 . 4 kg / m2 .
The mean duration of diabetes was 9 . 3 years .
More than 75 % of patients had impaired renal function and more than 20 % had an estimated GFR less than 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 .
Use of CV medications at baseline was similar between treatments ; platelet aggregation inhibitors ( aspirin and / or clopidogrel ) were used by 97 . 5 % of patients , statins by 92 . 7 % , ACE inhibitors and / or angiotensin II antagonists by 86 . 8 % , and beta - blockers by 84 . 4 % .
Prior to study entry , 93 . 9 % of patients used at least 1 glucose - lowering medication , including metformin ( 69 . 9 % ) , sulfonylureas ( 37 . 3 % ) and insulin ( 47 . 6 % ) .
During the study , antidiabetic medications were adjusted by the investigators per the local standard of care .
Ninety - six percent of the patients in both treatment groups completed the study in accordance with the protocol , and the vital status was known at the end of the study for 99 . 0 % and 98 . 6 % of the patients in the ADLYXIN and placebo group , respectively .
Median treatment duration was 22 . 4 months in the ADLYXIN group and 23 . 3 months in the placebo group , and the median duration of study follow - up was 25 . 8 and 25 . 7 months , respectively .
The results of the primary composite cardiovascular endpoint are shown in Table 12 .
The hazard ratio ( HR ) for ADLYXIN versus placebo was 1 . 02 , with an associated 2 - sided 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) of 0 . 89 to 1 . 17 .
The upper bound of this confidence interval , 1 . 17 , excluded a risk margin larger than 1 . 3 .
