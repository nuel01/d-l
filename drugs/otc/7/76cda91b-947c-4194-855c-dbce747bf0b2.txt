WARNING : ENDOMETRIAL CANCER , CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS , PROBABLE DEMENTIA and BREAST CANCER Estrogen - Alone Therapy Endometrial Cancer There is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens .
Adding a progestogen to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia , which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer .
Perform adequate diagnostic measures , including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed , persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Cardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia The Women ’ s Health Initiative ( WHI ) estrogen - alone substudy reported increased risks of stroke and deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) in postmenopausal women ( 50 to 79 years of age ) during 7 . 1 years of treatment with daily oral conjugated estrogens ( CE ) [ 0 . 625 mg ] - alone , relative to placebo [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The WHI Memory Study ( WHIMS ) estrogen - alone ancillary study of WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older during 5 . 2 years of treatment with daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone , relative to placebo .
It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Do not use estrogen - alone therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 , 14 . 3 ) ] .
Only daily oral 0 . 625 mg CE was studied in the estrogen - alone substudy of the WHI .
Therefore , the relevance of the WHI findings regarding adverse cardiovascular events and dementia to lower CE doses , other routes of administration , or other estrogen - alone products is not known .
Without such data , it is not possible to definitively exclude these risks or determine the extent of these risks for other products .
Discuss with your patient the benefits and risks of estrogen - alone therapy , taking into account her individual risk profile .
Prescribe estrogens with or without progestogens at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman .
Estrogen Plus Progestin Therapy Cardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported increased risks of DVT , pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , stroke and myocardial infarction ( MI ) in postmenopausal women ( 50 to 79 years of age ) during 5 . 6 years of treatment with daily oral CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA ) [ 2 . 5 mg ] , relative to placebo [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of the WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older during 4 years of treatment with daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) combined with MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) , relative to placebo .
It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Do not use estrogen plus progestogen therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 , 14 . 3 ) ] .
Breast Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy also demonstrated an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Only daily oral 0 . 625 mg CE and 2 . 5 mg MPA were studied in the estrogen plus progestin substudy of the WHI .
Therefore , the relevance of the WHI findings regarding adverse cardiovascular events , dementia and breast cancer to lower CE plus other MPA doses , other routes of administration , or other estrogen plus progestogen products is not known .
Without such data , it is not possible to definitively exclude these risks or determine the extent of these risks for other products .
Discuss with your patient the benefits and risks of estrogen plus progestogen therapy , taking into account her individual risk profile .
Prescribe estrogens with or without progestogens at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman .

Consider estrogen therapy only for women at significant risk of osteoporosis .
1 . 1 Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Limitation of Use • When prescribing solely for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis , first consider the use of non - estrogen medications .
Consider estrogen therapy only for women at significant risk of osteoporosis .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Generally , when estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus , consider addition of a progestogen to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer .
Generally a woman without a uterus does not need to take a progestogen in addition to her estrogen therapy .
In some cases , however , hysterectomized women who have a history of endometriosis may need a progestogen [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 14 ) ] .
Use estrogen - alone , or in combination with a progestogen at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman .
Reevaluate postmenopausal women periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary .
• • Apply Menostar once - weekly to the lower abdomen .
Do not apply Menostar to the breast .
( 2 . 1 ) 2 . 1 Prevention of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Apply Menostar 14 mcg per day to a clean dry area of the lower abdomen once weekly .
2 . 2 Application of the Menostar Transdermal System Site Selection • • Place the adhesive side of Menostar on a clean , dry area of the lower abdomen or the upper quadrant of the buttock .
• • Do not apply Menostar to or near the breasts .
• • Rotate the sites of application with an interval of at least 1 - week allowed between applications to a same site .
• • Select an area that is not oily , damaged , or irritated .
Avoid the waistline , since tight clothing may rub the transdermal system off .
• • Avoid application to areas where sitting would dislodge Menostar .
Application • • Apply Menostar immediately after opening the pouch and removing the protective liner .
• • Press Menostar firmly in place with the fingers for at least 10 seconds , making sure there is good contact , especially around the edges .
• • If the system lifts , apply pressure to maintain adhesion .
• • In the event that a system falls off , reapply it to a different location .
If the old system cannot be reapplied , apply a new system for the remainder of the 7 - day dosing interval .
• • Wear only one system at any one time during the 7 - day dosing interval .
• • Swimming , bathing , or using a sauna while using Menostar has not been studied , and these activities may decrease the adhesion of the system and the delivery of estradiol .
2 . 3 Removal of the Menostar Transdermal System • • Remove Menostar carefully and slowly to avoid irritation of the skin .
• • If any adhesive remains on the skin after removal of Menostar , allow the area to dry for 15 minutes and then gently rub the area with an oil - based cream or lotion to remove the adhesive residue .
• • Used patches still contain some active hormones .
Carefully fold each patch in half so that it sticks to itself before throwing it away .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Menostar ( estradiol transdermal system ) 14 mcg per day - each 3 . 25 cm2 system contains 1 mg of estradiol .
• • Transdermal system : 14 mcg per day ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Menostar is contraindicated in women with any of the following conditions : • • Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • • Breast cancer or history of breast cancer [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • • Estrogen - dependent neoplasia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • • Active DVT , PE , or a history of these conditions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Active arterial thromboembolic disease ( for example , stroke or MI ) , or a history of these conditions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Known anaphylactic reaction , or angioedema , or hypersensitivity to Menostar • • Hepatic impairment or disease • • Protein C , protein S , or antithrombin deficiency , or other known thrombophilic disorders • • Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding ( 4 , 5 . 2 ) ) • • Breast cancer or a history of breast cancer ( 4 , 5 . 2 ) • • Estrogen - dependent neoplasia ( 4 , 5 . 2 ) • • Active DVT , PE or a history of these conditions ( 4 , 5 . 1 ) ) • • Active arterial thromboembolic disease ( for example , stroke or MI ) , or a history of these conditions ( 4 , 5 . 1 ) • • Known anaphylactic reaction , or angioedema , or hypersensitivity to Menostar ( 4 ) • • Hepatic impairment or disease ( 4 , 5 . 10 ) • • Protein C , protein S , or antithrombin deficiency , or other known thrombophilic disorders ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Estrogens increase the risk of gallbladder disease ( 5 . 4 ) • • Discontinue estrogens if severe hypercalcemia , loss of vision , severe hypertriglyceridemia or cholestatic jaundice occurs ( 5 . 5 , 5 . 6 , 5 . 9 , 5 . 10 ) • • Monitor thyroid function in women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy ( 5 . 11 , 5 . 18 ) 5 . 1 Cardiovascular Disorders Increased risks of stroke and DVT are reported with estrogen - alone therapy .
Increased risks of PE , DVT , stroke and MI are reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy .
Immediately discontinue estrogen with or without progestogen therapy if any of these occur or are suspected .
Manage appropriately any risk factors for arterial vascular disease ( for example , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , tobacco use , hypercholesterolemia , and obesity ) and / or venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) ( for example , personal history or family history of VTE , obesity , and systemic lupus erythematosus ) .
Stroke The WHI estrogen - alone substudy reported a statistically significant increased risk of stroke in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo ( 45 versus 33 strokes per 10 , 000 women - years , respectively ) .
The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and persisted [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Immediately discontinue estrogen - alone therapy if a stroke occurs or is suspected .
Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone versus those receiving placebo ( 18 versus 21 per 10 , 000 women - years ) . 1 The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically significant increased risk of stroke in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo ( 33 versus 25 strokes per 10 , 000 women years , respectively ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted . 1 Immediately discontinue estrogen plus progestogen therapy if a stroke occurs or is suspected .
Coronary Heart Disease The WHI estrogen - alone substudy reported no overall effect on coronary heart disease ( CHD ) events ( defined as nonfatal MI , silent MI , or CHD death ) in women receiving estrogen - alone compared to placebo2 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age , who were less than 10 years since menopause , suggest a reduction ( not statistically significant ) of CHD events in those women receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone compared to placebo ( 8 versus 16 per 10 , 000 women - years ) . 1 The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk ( not statistically significant ) of CHD events in women receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) compared to women receiving placebo ( 41 versus 34 per 10 , 000 women - years ) . 1 An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1 , and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease ( n = 2 , 763 ) , average 66 . 7 years of age , in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease ( Heart and Estrogen / Progestin Replacement Study ; HERS ) , treatment with daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit .
During an average follow - up of 4 . 1 years , treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established CHD .
There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA - treated group than in the placebo group in year 1 , but not during the subsequent years .
Two thousand three hundred twenty - one ( 2 , 321 ) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS , HERS II .
Average follow - up in HERS II was an additional 2 . 7 years , for a total of 6 . 8 years overall .
Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS , HERS II , and overall .
Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen - alone substudy , the risk of VTE ( DVT and PE ) was increased for women receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone compared to placebo ( 30 versus 22 per 10 , 000 women - years ) , although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance ( 23 versus 15 per 10 , 000 women - years ) .
The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years3 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Immediately discontinue estrogen - alone therapy if VTE occurs or is suspected .
The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically significant 2 - fold greater rate of VTE in women receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) compared to women receiving placebo ( 35 versus 17 per 10 , 000 women - years ) .
Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT ( 26 versus 13 per 10 , 000 women - years ) and PE ( 18 versus 8 per 10 , 000 women - years ) were also demonstrated .
The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted4 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Immediately discontinue estrogen plus progestogen therapy if a VTE occurs or is suspected .
If feasible , discontinue estrogens at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism , or during periods of prolonged immobilization .
5 . 2 Malignant Neoplasms Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus .
The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non - users and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose .
Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year .
The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use , with increased risks of 15 - to 24 - fold for 5 to 10 years or more , and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued .
Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen - alone or estrogen plus progestogen therapy is important .
Perform adequate diagnostic measures , including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding with unknown etiology .
There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose .
Adding a progestogen to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia , which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer .
Breast Cancer The WHI substudy of daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen - alone users .
In the WHI estrogen - alone substudy , after an average follow - up of 7 . 1 years , daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [ relative risk ( RR ) 0 . 80 ] 5 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
After a mean follow - up of 5 . 6 years , the WHI substudy of daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA compared to placebo .
In this substudy , prior use of estrogen - alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women .
The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1 . 24 , and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10 , 000 women - years , for CE plus MPA compared with placebo [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy , the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1 . 86 , and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10 , 000 women - years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo . 6 Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy , the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1 . 09 , and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10 , 000 women - years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo .
In the same substudy , invasive breast cancers were larger , were more likely to be node positive , and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) group compared with the placebo group .
Metastatic disease was rare , with no apparent difference between the two groups .
Other prognostic factors , such as histologic subtype , grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups6 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Consistent with the WHI clinical trial , observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer with estrogen plus progestin therapy , and a smaller increase in the risk for breast cancer with estrogen - alone therapy , after several years of use .
The risk increased with duration of use , and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment ( only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping ) .
Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater , and became apparent earlier , with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen - alone therapy .
These studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations , doses , or routes of administration .
The use of estrogen - alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation .
All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self - examinations .
In addition , mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age , risk factors , and prior mammogram results .
Ovarian Cancer The CE plus MPA substudy of WHI reported that estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of ovarian cancer .
After an average follow - up of 5 . 6 years , the relative risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1 . 58 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 77 - 3 . 24 ) , but it was not statistically significant .
The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10 , 000 women - years . 7 A meta - analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer .
The primary analysis , using case - control comparisons , included 12 , 110 cancer cases from the 17 prospective studies .
The relative risks associated with current use of hormonal therapy was 1 . 41 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1 . 32 to 1 . 50 ) ; there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure ( less than 5 years [ median of 3 years ] vs . greater than 5 years [ median of 10 years ] of use before the cancer diagnosis ) .
The relative risk associated with combined current and recent use ( discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis ) was 1 . 37 ( 95 % CI 1 . 27 to 1 . 48 ) , and the elevated risk was significant for both estrogen - alone and estrogen plus progestin products .
The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer , however , is unknown .
5 . 3 Probable Dementia In the WHI Memory Study ( WHIMS ) estrogen - alone ancillary study , a population of 2 , 947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age were randomized to daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone or placebo .
After an average follow - up of 5 . 2 years , 28 women in the estrogen - alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia .
The relative risk of probable dementia for CE - alone versus placebo was 1 . 49 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 83 - 2 . 66 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE - alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10 , 000 women - years8 [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study , a population of 4 , 532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) or placebo .
After an average follow - up of 4 years , 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia . The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2 . 05 ( 95 percent CI , 1 . 21 - 3 . 48 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10 , 000 women - years8 [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen - alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol , the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1 . 76 ( 95 percent CI , 1 . 19 - 2 . 60 ) .
Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age , it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women8 [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 4 Gallbladder Disease A 2 - to 4 - fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported .
5 . 5 Hypercalcemia Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in women with breast cancer and bone metastases .
Discontinue estrogens , including Menostar if hypercalcemia occurs , and take appropriate measures to reduce the serum calcium level .
5 . 6 Visual Abnormalities Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in women receiving estrogens .
Discontinue Menostar pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision , or a sudden onset of proptosis , diplopia , or migraine .
Permanently discontinue estrogens , including Menostar , if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions .
5 . 7 Addition of a Progestogen When a Woman Has Not Had a Hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestogen for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration , or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen , have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone .
Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer .
There are , however , possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestogens with estrogens compared to estrogen - alone regimens .
These include an increased risk of breast cancer .
5 . 8 Elevated Blood Pressure In a small number of case reports , substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens .
In a large , randomized , placebo - controlled clinical trial , a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen .
5 . 9 Exacerbation of Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre - existing hypertriglyceridemia , estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis .
Discontinue Menostar if pancreatitis occurs .
5 . 10 Hepatic Impairment and / or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with hepatic impairment .
Exercise caution in any woman with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy .
In the case of recurrence of cholestatic jaundice , discontinue Menostar .
5 . 11 Exacerbation of Hypothyroidism Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid - binding globulin ( TBG ) levels .
Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone , thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range .
Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy .
Monitor thyroid function in these women during treatment with Menostar to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range .
5 . 12 Fluid Retention Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention .
Monitor any woman with a condition ( s ) that might predispose her to fluid retention , such as a cardiac or renal impairment .
Discontinue estrogen - alone therapy , including Menostar , with evidence of medically concerning fluid retention .
5 . 13 Hypocalcemia Estrogen - induced hypocalcemia may occur in women with hypoparathyroidism .
Consider whether the benefits of estrogen therapy , including Menostar , outweigh the risks in such women .
5 . 14 Exacerbation of Endometriosis A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post - hysterectomy with estrogen - alone therapy .
Consider the addition of progestogen therapy for women known to have residual endometriosis post - hysterectomy .
5 . 15 Hereditary Angioedema Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema .
Consider whether the benefits of estrogen therapy , including Menostar , outweigh the risks in such women .
5 . 16 Exacerbation of Other Conditions 5 . 17 Laboratory Tests Serum follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of postmenopausal women using Menostar for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis .
5 . 18 Drug - Laboratory Test Interactions • • Accelerated prothrombin time , partial thromboplastin time , and platelet aggregation time ; increased platelet count ; increased factors II , VII antigen , VIII antigen , VIII coagulant activity , IX , X , XII , VII - X complex , II - VII - X complex , and beta - thromboglobulin ; decreased levels of antifactor Xa and antithrombin III , decreased antithrombin III activity ; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity ; increased plasminogen antigen and activity .
• • Increased TBG levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone , as measured by protein - bound iodine ( PBI ) , T4 levels ( by column or by radioimmunoassay ) or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay .
T3 resin uptake is decreased , reflecting the elevated TBG .
Free T4 and free T3 concentrations are unaltered .
Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone .
• • Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum , for example , corticosteroid binding globulin ( CBG ) , sex hormone - binding globulin ( SHBG ) , leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids , respectively .
Free hormone concentrations , such as testosterone and estradiol , may be decreased .
Other plasma proteins may be increased ( angiotensinogen / renin substrate , alpha - l - antitrypsin , ceruloplasmin ) .
• • Increased plasma high - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations , reduced low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol concentration , and increased triglyceride levels .
Impaired glucose tolerance .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling : • • Cardiovascular Disorders [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Malignant Neoplasms [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 10 percent ) with Menostar are : upper respiratory tract infections , pain , arthralgia , and leukorrhea .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Menostar was investigated in a 2 - year double blind , placebo - controlled , multicenter study in the United States .
A total of 417 postmenopausal women ( 208 women on Menostar , 209 on placebo ) 60 to 80 years old , with an intact uterus were enrolled in the study .
At 24 months , 189 women remained in the Menostar group and 186 remained in the placebo group .
Adverse events with an incidence of ≥ 5 percent in the Menostar 14 mcg group and greater than those reported in the placebo group are listed in Table 1 .

Therefore , inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism .
Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St . John ’ s wort ( hypericum perforatum ) preparations , phenobarbital , carbamazepine , and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens , possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and / or changes in the uterine bleeding profile .
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin , clarithromycin , ketoconazole , itraconazole , ritonavir and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and may result in adverse reactions .
• • Inducers and / or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism and decrease or increase the estrogen plasma concentration .
( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Menostar is not indicated for use in pregnancy .
There are no data with the use of Menostar in pregnant women , however , epidemiologic studies and meta - analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non - genital birth defects ( including cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects ) following exposure to combined hormonal contraceptives ( estrogens and progestins ) before conception or during early pregnancy .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Estrogens are present in human milk and can reduce milk production in breast - feeding females .
This reduction can occur at any time but is less likely to occur once breast - feeding is well - established .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for Menostar and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Menostar or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Menostar is not indicated for use in pediatric patients .
Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use A total of 417 postmenopausal women 61 to 79 years old , with an intact uterus , participated in the osteoporosis trial .
More than 50 percent of women receiving study drug , were 65 years of age or older .
Efficacy in older ( ≥ 65 years of age ) and younger ( < 65 years of age ) postmenopausal women in the osteoporosis treatment trial was comparable both at 12 and 24 months .
Safety in older ( ≥ 65 years of age ) and younger ( < 65 years of age ) postmenopausal women in the osteoporosis treatment trial was also comparable throughout the study .
The Women ’ s Health Initiative Studies In the WHI estrogen - alone substudy ( daily CE [ 0 . 625 mg ] - alone versus placebo ) , there was a higher relative risk of stroke in women greater than 65 years of age [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy ( daily CE [ 0 . 625 mg ] plus MPA [ 2 . 5 mg ] versus placebo ) , there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The Women ’ s Health Initiative Memory Study In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age , there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen - alone or estrogen plus progestin when compared to placebo [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age , it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women8 [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage of estrogen may cause nausea and vomiting , breast tenderness , abdominal pain , drowsiness and fatigue , and withdrawal bleeding in women .
Treatment of overdose consists of discontinuation of Menostar therapy with institution of appropriate symptomatic care .
11 DESCRIPTION Menostar ( estradiol transdermal system ) is designed to provide nominal in vivo delivery of 14 mcg of estradiol per day continuously upon application to intact skin .
The period of use is 7 days .
The transdermal system has a contact surface area of 3 . 25 cm2 , and contains 1 mg of estradiol USP .
Estradiol USP is a white , crystalline powder , chemically described as estra - 1 , 3 , 5 ( 10 ) - triene - 3 , 17ß - diol .
It has an empirical formula of C18H24O2 and molecular weight of 272 . 38 .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The Menostar transdermal system comprises three layers .
Proceeding from the visible surface toward the surface attached to the skin , these layers are : 1 .
A translucent polyethylene film .
2 .
An acrylate adhesive matrix containing estradiol USP .
3 .
A protective liner of siliconized or fluoropolymer - coated polyester film is attached to the adhesive surface and must be removed before the transdermal system can be used .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] The active component of the transdermal system is estradiol .
The remaining components of the transdermal system ( acrylate copolymer adhesive , fatty acid esters , and polyethylene backing ) are pharmacologically inactive .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics .
Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions , estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites , estrone and estriol , at the receptor level .
The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle , which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily , depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle .
After menopause , most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione , which is secreted by the adrenal cortex , to estrone in the peripheral tissues .
Thus , estrone and the sulfate conjugated form , estrone sulfate , are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women .
Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen - responsive tissues .
To date , two estrogen receptors have been identified .
These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue .
Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) and follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , through a negative feedback mechanism .
Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Generally , a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman ’ s therapeutic response to Menostar nor her risk for adverse outcomes .
Likewise , exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The bioavailability of estradiol following application of a Menostar transdermal system , relative to that of a transdermal system delivering 25 mcg per day , was investigated in 18 healthy postmenopausal women , mean age 66 years ( range 60 to 80 years ) .
The mean serum estradiol concentrations upon administration of the two patches to the lower abdomen are shown in Figure 1 .
Transdermal administration of Menostar produced geometric mean serum concentration ( Cavg ) of estradiol of 13 . 7 pg / mL .
No patches failed to adhere during the one week application period of both transdermal systems .
Following application of the Menostar transdermal system to the abdomen , it is estimated to provide an average nominal in - vivo daily delivery of 14 mcg estradiol per day .
The Menostar transdermal delivery system continuously releases estradiol which is transported across intact skin leading to sustained circulating levels of estradiol during a 7 - day treatment period .
The systemic availability of estradiol after transdermal administration is about 20 times higher than that after oral administration .
This difference is due to the absence of first pass metabolism when estradiol is given by the transdermal route .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Table 2 provides a summary of estradiol pharmacokinetic parameters determined during evaluation of the Menostar transdermal system using baseline uncorrected serum concentrations .

The estimated estradiol daily delivery rate for Climara 6 . 5 cm2 is quoted from the Climara labeling .
Distribution The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens .
Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs .
Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to SHBG and albumin .
In the clinical study with 208 patients on Menostar , SHBG concentration ( mean ± SD ) remained essentially unchanged over the 2 year period ( baseline 45 . 1 ± 20 . 1 nmol / L , 24 - month visit 46 . 4 ± 20 . 9 nmol / L ) .
Metabolism Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens .
Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions .
These transformations take place mainly in the liver .
Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone , and both can be converted to estriol , which is a major urinary metabolite .
Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver , biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine , and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption .
In postmenopausal women , a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates , especially estrone sulfate , which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens .
Excretion Estradiol , estrone , and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates .
Adhesion In a Menostar transdermal system pharmacokinetic study with 18 postmenopausal women , no patches failed to adhere during the one - week application period .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast , uterus , cervix , vagina , testis , and liver .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Effects on Bone Mineral Density in Postmenopausal Women The efficacy of Menostar in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis was investigated in a 2 - year double blind , placebo - controlled , multicenter study in the United States .
A total of 417 postmenopausal women , 60 to 80 years of age , with an intact uterus were enrolled in the study .
All participants received supplemental calcium and vitamin D .
At the lumbar spine Menostar increased BMD by 2 . 3 percent after 1 year and 3 percent after 2 years compared with a 0 . 5 percent increase after 1 and 2 years of treatment with placebo .
At the hip Menostar increased BMD by 0 . 9 percent after one year and 0 . 84 percent after two years compared with a mean decrease of 0 . 22 percent after 1 year and 0 . 71 percent after 2 years of placebo treatment .
The changes in BMD from baseline were statistically significantly ( p < 0 . 001 ) greater during treatment with Menostar than during treatment with placebo for both the spine and hip after 1 and 2 years ( Table 3 ) .

The BMD data of the study were analyzed according to baseline estradiol levels of the patients .
Overall , estimated treatment effects on lumbar spine and total hip BMD after 2 years were approximately twice as large in the subgroup with baseline estradiol levels < 5 pg / mL than in the subgroup with baseline estradiol levels ≥ 5 pg / mL ( Table 4 ) .

For those outcomes included in the WHI " global index " that reached statistical significance , the absolute excess risks per 10 , 000 women - years in the group treated with CE - alone was 12 more strokes , while the absolute risk reduction per 10 , 000 women - years was 7 fewer hip fractures . 9 The absolute excess risk of events included in the " global index " was a non - significant 5 events per 10 , 000 women - years .
There was no difference between the groups in terms of all - cause mortality .
No overall difference for primary CHD events ( nonfatal MI , silent MI and CHD death ) and invasive breast cancer incidence in women receiving CE - alone compared with placebo was reported in final centrally adjudicated results from the estrogen - alone substudy , after an average follow - up of 7 . 1 years .
See Table 5 .
Centrally adjudicated results for stroke events from the estrogen - alone substudy , after an average follow - up of 7 . 1 years , reported no significant difference in the distribution of stroke subtype and severity , including fatal strokes , in women receiving estrogen - alone compared to placebo .
Estrogen - alone increased the risk of ischemic stroke , and this excess risk was present in all subgroups of women examined . 10 See Table 5 .
Timing of initiation of estrogen - alone therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk benefit profile .
The WHI estrogen - alone substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a non - significant trend toward reduced risk for CHD [ hazard ratio ( HR ) 0 . 63 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 36 - 1 . 09 ) ] and overall mortality [ HR 0 . 71 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 46 - 1 . 11 ) ] .
WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early .
According to the predefined stopping rule , after an average follow - up of 5 . 6 years of treatment , the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the " global index " .
The absolute excess risk of events included in the “ global index ” was 19 per 10 , 000 women - years .
For those outcomes included in the WHI “ global index ” that reached statistical significance after 5 . 6 years of follow - up , the absolute excess risks per 10 , 000 women - years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events , 8 more strokes , 10 more PEs , and 8 more invasive breast cancers , while the absolute risk reduction per 10 , 000 women - years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures .
Results of the CE plus MPA substudy , which included 16 , 608 women ( average 63 years of age , range 50 to 79 ; 83 . 9 percent White , 6 . 5 percent Black , 5 . 4 percent Hispanic , 3 . 9 percent Other ) , are presented in Table 6 .

14 . 3 Women ' s Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen - alone ancillary study of WHI enrolled 2 , 947 predominantly healthy hysterectomized postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age and older ( 45 percent were 65 to 69 years of age ; 36 percent were 70 to 74 years of age ; 19 percent were 75 years of age and older ) to evaluate the effects of daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone on the incidence of probable dementia ( primary outcome ) compared to placebo .
After an average follow - up of 5 . 2 years , the relative risk of probable dementia for CE - alone versus placebo was 1 . 49 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 83 - 2 . 66 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE - alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10 , 000 women - years .
Probable dementia as defined in the study included Alzheimer ’ s disease ( AD ) , vascular dementia ( VaD ) and mixed types ( having features of both AD and VaD ) .
The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD .
Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age , it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study enrolled 4 , 532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older ( 47 percent were 65 to 69 years of age ; 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age ; and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older ) to evaluate the effects of daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) on the incidence of probable dementia ( primary outcome ) compared to placebo .
After an average follow - up of 4 years , the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2 . 05 ( 95 percent CI , 1 . 21 - 3 . 48 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10 , 000 women - years .
Probable dementia as defined in the study included AD , VaD and mixed types ( having features of both AD and VaD ) .
The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD .
Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age , it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
When data from the two populations were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol , the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1 . 76 ( 95 percent CI , 1 . 19 - 2 . 60 ) .
Differences between groups became apparent in the first year of treatment .
It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
