DESCRIPTION 1 . 5 % Glycine Irrigation , USP is a sterile , nonpyrogenic , nonhemolytic , nonelectrolytic or very weakly ionized solution in single dose UROMATIC containers for use as a urologic irrigating solution .
Each liter contains 15 g Glycine , USP ( NH2CH2COOH ) in water for injection .
pH 6 . 0 ( 4 . 5 to 6 . 5 ) .
Osmolarity 200 mOsmol / L ( calc . )
.
Normal physiologic osmolarity range is approximately 280 to 310 mOsmol / L .
No antimicrobial agent has been added .
The UROMATIC plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinyl chloride ( PL 146 plastic ) .
The amount of water that can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period , e . g . , di - 2 - ethylhexyl phthalate ( DEHP ) , up to 5 parts per million ; however , the safety of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 1 . 5 % Glycine Irrigation , USP is useful as an irrigating solution for the urinary bladder because this solution is nonhemolytic , nonelectrolytic or very weakly ionized , and provides a high degree of visibility for urologic procedures requiring endoscopy .
During transurethral surgical procedures , the solution acts as a lavage for removing blood and tissue fragments .
It also maintains the patency of an indwelling catheter in the immediate postoperative period .
Glycine which enters the systemic circulation is converted to serine and glyoxylic acid .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE 1 . 5 % Glycine Irrigation , USP is indicated for use as a urologic irrigating fluid with endoscopic instruments during transurethral procedures requiring distension , irrigation , and lavage of the urinary bladder .
It may be used for lavage of an indwelling catheter to maintain patency .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Anuria .
WARNINGS Not for injection .
Solutions for urologic irrigation must be used with caution in patients with severe cardiopulmonary or renal dysfunction .
Irrigating fluids used during transurethral prostatectomy have been demonstrated to enter the systemic circulation in relatively large volumes ; thus 1 . 5 % Glycine Irrigation , USP must be regarded as a systemic drug .
Absorption of large amounts of fluids containing glycine may significantly alter cardiopulmonary and renal dynamics .
Careful cardiovascular monitoring should be maintained due to the possibility of fluid overload .
Should fluid overload occur , intensive fluid and electrolyte management is necessary .
Monitoring of fluid and electrolyte levels beyond the acute phase may be considered due to the possibility of delayed fluid absorption .
( See ADVERSE REACTIONS , Post - Marketing Experience ) .
The contents of an opened container should be used promptly to minimize the possibility of bacterial growth or pyrogen formation .
Discard the unused portion of irrigating solution since no antimicrobial agent has been added .
PRECAUTIONS The cardiovascular status , especially of the patient with cardiac disease , should be carefully observed before and during transurethral resection of the prostate when using 1 . 5 % Glycine Irrigation , USP , because the quantity of fluid absorbed into the systemic circulation by opened prostatic veins may produce significant expansion of the intravascular fluid and lead to fulminating congestive heart failure .
Shift of sodium - free intracellular fluid into the extracellular compartment , following systemic absorption , may lower serum sodium concentration and aggravate preexisting hyponatremia .
Care should be exercised if impaired liver function is known or suspected .
Under such conditions ammonia resulting from metabolism of glycine may accumulate in the blood .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with 1 . 5 % Glycine Irrigation , USP .
It is not known whether 1 . 5 % Glycine Irrigation , USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity .
1 . 5 % Glycine Irrigation , USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Irrigation Solutions did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from other younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
Do not administer unless the solution is clear and the seal is intact .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions may result from intravascular absorption of glycine .
Large intravenous doses of glycine are known to cause salivation , nausea and lightheadedness .
Other consequences of absorption of urologic irrigating solutions include fluid and electrolyte disturbances such as acidosis , electrolyte loss , marked diuresis , urinary retention , edema , dryness of mouth , thirst , dehydration , coma from hyponatremia , secondary hyponatremia due to fluid overload , and hyperammonemia with resultant coma and / or encephalopathy ; cardiovascular disorders such as hypotension , tachycardia , angina - like pains ; pulmonary disorders such as pulmonary congestion ; and other general reactions such as blurred vision , convulsions , nausea , vomiting , rhinitis , chills , vertigo , backache , transient blindness and urticaria .
Allergic reactions from glycine are unknown or exceedingly rare .
Should adverse reactions occur , discontinue the irrigation and re - evaluate the clinical status of the patient .
Post - Marketing Experience Following off - label use of 1 . 5 % Glycine Irrigation , USP for hysteroscopic procedures in women , life - threatening adverse events related to fluid overload have been reported .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of overhydration or solute overload , re - evaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective measures .
See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The volume of solution needed will vary with the nature and duration of the urologic procedure .
If desired , warm in overwrap to near body temperature in a water bath or oven heated to not more than 45 ° C . Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit .
HOW SUPPLIED 1 . 5 % Glycine Irrigation , USP in UROMATIC plastic containers is available as follows : 2B7317 3000 mL NDC 0338 - 0289 - 47 Color variation in this product is normal and does not alter efficacy or visualization during TUR procedures .
Exposure of pharmaceutical products to heat should be minimized .
Avoid excessive heat .
It is recommended the product be stored at room temperature ( 25 ° C ) ; brief exposure up to 40 ° C does not adversely affect the product .
Directions for Use Tear overwrap down side at slit and remove solution container .
Visually inspect the container .
If the outlet port protector is damaged , detached , or not present , discard container as solution path sterility may be impaired .
Some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed .
This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety .
The opacity will diminish gradually .
Check for minute leaks by squeezing bag firmly .
If leaks are found , discard solution as sterility may be impaired .
Use Aseptic Technique .
• 1 .
Suspend container using hanger hole .
• 2 .
Remove protector from outlet port .
• 3 .
Attach irrigation set .
Refer to complete directions accompanying set .
