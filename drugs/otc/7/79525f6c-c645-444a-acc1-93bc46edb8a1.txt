1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE LUMIGAN ® 0 . 01 % and 0 . 03 % ( bimatoprost ophthalmic solution ) is indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension .
LUMIGAN ® is a prostaglandin analog indicated for the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dosage is one drop in the affected eye ( s ) once daily in the evening .
LUMIGAN ® 0 . 01 % and 0 . 03 % ( bimatoprost ophthalmic solution ) should not be administered more than once daily since it has been shown that more frequent administration of prostaglandin analogs may decrease the intraocular pressure lowering effect .
Reduction of the intraocular pressure starts approximately 4 hours after the first administration with maximum effect reached within approximately 8 to 12 hours .
LUMIGAN ® may be used concomitantly with other topical ophthalmic drug products to lower intraocular pressure .
If more than one topical ophthalmic drug is being used , the drugs should be administered at least five ( 5 ) minutes apart .
One drop in the affected eye ( s ) once daily in the evening .
( 2 ) 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Ophthalmic solution containing bimatoprost 0 . 1 mg / mL ( LUMIGAN ® 0 . 01 % ) or containing bimatoprost 0 . 3 mg / mL ( LUMIGAN ® 0 . 03 % ) .
Solution containing 0 . 1 mg / mL bimatoprost ( LUMIGAN ® 0 . 01 % ) or containing 0 . 3 mg / mL bimatoprost ( LUMIGAN ® 0 . 03 % ) .
( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Pigmentation .
• Pigmentation of the iris , periorbital tissue ( eyelid ) and eyelashes can occur .
Iris pigmentation is likely to be permanent ( 5 . 1 ) .
• Eyelash Changes .
• Gradual change to eyelashes including increased length , thickness and number of lashes .
Usually reversible .
( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Pigmentation Bimatoprost ophthalmic solution has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues .
The most frequently reported changes have been increased pigmentation of the iris , periorbital tissue ( eyelid ) and eyelashes .
Pigmentation is expected to increase as long as bimatoprost is administered .
The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes .
After discontinuation of bimatoprost , pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent , while pigmentation of the periorbital tissue and eyelash changes have been reported to be reversible in some patients .
Patients who receive treatment should be informed of the possibility of increased pigmentation .
The long term effects of increased pigmentation are not known .
Iris color change may not be noticeable for several months to years .
Typically , the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts of the iris become more brownish .
Neither nevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by treatment .
While treatment with LUMIGAN ® 0 . 01 % and 0 . 03 % ( bimatoprost ophthalmic solution ) can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation , these patients should be examined regularly .
( see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION , 17 . 1 ) .
5 . 2 Eyelash Changes LUMIGAN ® 0 . 01 % and 0 . 03 % may gradually change eyelashes and vellus hair in the treated eye .
These changes include increased length , thickness , and number of lashes .
Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment .
5 . 3 Intraocular Inflammation LUMIGAN ® 0 . 01 % and 0 . 03 % should be used with caution in patients with active intraocular inflammation ( e . g . , uveitis ) because the inflammation may be exacerbated .
5 . 4 Macular Edema Macular edema , including cystoid macular edema , has been reported during treatment with bimatoprost ophthalmic solution .
LUMIGAN ® 0 . 01 % and 0 . 03 % should be used with caution in aphakic patients , in pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule , or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema .
5 . 5 Angle - closure , Inflammatory , or Neovascular Glaucoma LUMIGAN ® 0 . 01 % and 0 . 03 % has not been evaluated for the treatment of angle - closure , inflammatory or neovascular glaucoma .
5 . 6 Bacterial Keratitis There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple - dose containers of topical ophthalmic products .
These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who , in most cases , had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface ( see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION , 17 . 3 ) .
5 . 7 Use with Contact Lenses Contact lenses should be removed prior to instillation of LUMIGAN ® 0 . 01 % and 0 . 03 % and may be reinserted 15 minutes following its administration .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reaction ( range 25 % - 45 % ) is conjunctival hyperemia .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Allergan at 1 - 800 - 433 - 8871 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In clinical studies with bimatoprost ophthalmic solutions ( 0 . 01 % or 0 . 03 % ) the most common adverse event was conjunctival hyperemia ( range 25 % – 45 % ) .
Approximately 0 . 5 % to 3 % of patients discontinued therapy due to conjunctival hyperemia with 0 . 01 % or 0 . 03 % bimatoprost ophthalmic solutions .
Other common events ( > 10 % ) included growth of eyelashes , and ocular pruritus .
Additional ocular adverse events ( reported in 1 to 10 % of patients ) with bimatoprost ophthalmic solutions included ocular dryness , visual disturbance , ocular burning , foreign body sensation , eye pain , pigmentation of the periocular skin , blepharitis , cataract , superficial punctate keratitis , eyelid erythema , ocular irritation , eyelash darkening , eye discharge , tearing , photophobia , allergic conjunctivitis , asthenopia , increases in iris pigmentation , conjunctival edema , conjunctival hemorrhage , and abnormal hair growth .
Intraocular inflammation , reported as iritis was reported in less than 1 % of patients .
Systemic adverse events reported in approximately 10 % of patients with bimatoprost ophthalmic solutions were infections ( primarily colds and upper respiratory tract infections ) .
Other systemic adverse events ( reported in 1 to 5 % of patients ) included headaches , abnormal liver function tests , and asthenia .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Use in pediatric patients below the age of 16 years is not recommended because of potential safety concerns related to increased pigmentation following long - term chronic use .
( 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Teratogenic effects : In embryo / fetal developmental studies in pregnant mice and rats , abortion was observed at oral doses of bimatoprost which achieved at least 33 or 97 times , respectively , the maximum intended human exposure based on blood AUC levels .
At doses at least 41 times the maximum intended human exposure based on blood AUC levels , the gestation length was reduced in the dams , the incidence of dead fetuses , late resorptions , peri - and postnatal pup mortality was increased , and pup body weights were reduced .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of LUMIGAN ® 0 . 01 % and 0 . 03 % ( bimatoprost ophthalmic solution ) administration in pregnant women .
Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response LUMIGAN ® should be administered during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether LUMIGAN ® 0 . 01 % and 0 . 03 % is excreted in human milk , although in animal studies , bimatoprost has been shown to be excreted in breast milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when LUMIGAN ® is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Use in pediatric patients below the age of 16 years is not recommended because of potential safety concerns related to increased pigmentation following long - term chronic use .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No overall clinical differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment In patients with a history of liver disease or abnormal ALT , AST and / or bilirubin at baseline , bimatoprost 0 . 03 % had no adverse effect on liver function over 48 months .
10 OVERDOSAGE No information is available on overdosage in humans .
If overdose with LUMIGAN ® 0 . 01 % and 0 . 03 % ( bimatoprost ophthalmic solution ) occurs , treatment should be symptomatic .
In oral ( by gavage ) mouse and rat studies , doses up to 100 mg / kg / day did not produce any toxicity .
This dose expressed as mg / m2 is at least 70 times higher than the accidental dose of one bottle of LUMIGAN ® 0 . 03 % for a 10 kg child .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Bimatoprost , a prostaglandin analog , is a synthetic structural analog of prostaglandin with ocular hypotensive activity .
It selectively mimics the effects of naturally occurring substances , prostamides .
Bimatoprost is believed to lower intraocular pressure ( IOP ) in humans by increasing outflow of aqueous humor through both the trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral routes .
Elevated IOP presents a major risk factor for glaucomatous field loss .
The higher the level of IOP , the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption : After one drop of bimatoprost ophthalmic solution 0 . 03 % was administered once daily to both eyes of 15 healthy subjects for two weeks , blood concentrations peaked within 10 minutes after dosing and were below the lower limit of detection ( 0 . 025 ng / mL ) in most subjects within 1 . 5 hours after dosing .
Mean Cmax and AUC0 - 24 hr values were similar on days 7 and 14 at approximately 0 . 08 ng / mL and 0 . 09 ng • hr / mL , respectively , indicating that steady state was reached during the first week of ocular dosing .
There was no significant systemic drug accumulation over time .
Distribution : Bimatoprost is moderately distributed into body tissues with a steady - state volume of distribution of 0 . 67 L / kg .
In human blood , bimatoprost resides mainly in the plasma .
Approximately 12 % of bimatoprost remains unbound in human plasma .
Metabolism : Bimatoprost is the major circulating species in the blood once it reaches the systemic circulation following ocular dosing .
Bimatoprost then undergoes oxidation , N - deethylation and glucuronidation to form a diverse variety of metabolites .
Elimination : Following an intravenous dose of radiolabeled bimatoprost ( 3 . 12 μg / kg ) to six healthy subjects , the maximum blood concentration of unchanged drug was 12 . 2 ng / mL and decreased rapidly with an elimination half - life of approximately 45 minutes .
The total blood clearance of bimatoprost was 1 . 5 L / hr / kg .
Up to 67 % of the administered dose was excreted in the urine while 25 % of the dose was recovered in the feces .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Bimatoprost was not carcinogenic in either mice or rats when administered by oral gavage at doses of up to 2 mg / kg / day and 1 mg / kg / day respectively ( at least 192 and 291 times the recommended human exposure based on blood AUC levels respectively ) for 104 weeks .
Bimatoprost was not mutagenic or clastogenic in the Ames test , in the mouse lymphoma test , or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus tests .
Bimatoprost did not impair fertility in male or female rats up to doses of 0 . 6 mg / kg / day ( at least 103 times the recommended human exposure based on blood AUC levels ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES In clinical studies of patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension with a mean baseline IOP of 26 mmHg , the IOP - lowering effect of LUMIGAN ® 0 . 03 % ( bimatoprost ophthalmic solution ) once daily ( in the evening ) was 7 - 8 mmHg .
In a 3 month clinical study of patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension with an average baseline IOP of 23 . 5 mmHg , the IOP - lowering effect of LUMIGAN ® 0 . 01 % once daily ( in the evening ) was up to 7 . 5 mmHg and was approximately 0 . 5 mmHg less effective than LUMIGAN ® 0 . 03 % .
In this same study , LUMIGAN ® 0 . 01 % also had a similar overall safety profile compared with LUMIGAN ® 0 . 03 % .
After 12 months of treatment , discontinuations were 8 . 1 % for LUMIGAN ® 0 . 01 % and 13 . 4 % for LUMIGAN ® 0 . 03 % .
