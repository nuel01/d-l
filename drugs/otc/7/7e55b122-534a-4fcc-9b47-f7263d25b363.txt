6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Treatment - Naïve Studies The following safety assessment of ISENTRESS in treatment - naïve subjects is based on the randomized double - blind active controlled study of treatment - naïve subjects , STARTMRK ( Protocol 021 ) with ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in combination with a fixed dose of emtricitabine 200 mg ( + ) tenofovir 300 mg , ( N = 281 ) versus efavirenz ( EFV ) 600 mg at bedtime in combination with emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir , ( N = 282 ) .
During double - blind treatment , the total follow - up for subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily + emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir was 247 patient - years and 241 patient - years for subjects receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime + emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir .
In Protocol 021 , the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions was 3 % in subjects receiving ISENTRESS + emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir and 6 % in subjects receiving efavirenz + emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir .
The clinical adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) listed below were considered by investigators to be causally related to ISENTRESS + emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir or efavirenz + emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir .
Clinical ADRs of moderate to severe intensity occurring in ≥ 2 % of treatment - naïve subjects treated with ISENTRESS and occurring at a higher rate than efavirenz are presented in Table 1 .

Treatment - Experienced Studies The safety assessment of ISENTRESS in treatment - experienced subjects is based on the pooled safety data from the randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials , BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 ( Protocols 018 and 019 ) in antiretroviral treatment - experienced HIV - 1 infected adult subjects .
A total of 462 subjects received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in combination with optimized background therapy ( OBT ) compared to 237 subjects taking placebo in combination with OBT .
The median duration of therapy in these trials was 48 weeks for subjects receiving ISENTRESS and 38 weeks for subjects receiving placebo .
The total exposure to ISENTRESS was 387 patient - years versus 156 patient - years on placebo .
The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 2 % in subjects receiving ISENTRESS and 3 % in subjects receiving placebo .
Clinical ADRs were considered by investigators to be causally related to ISENTRESS + OBT or placebo + OBT .
Clinical ADRs of moderate to severe intensity occurring in ≥ 2 % of subjects treated with ISENTRESS and occurring at a higher exposure adjusted rate compared to placebo are presented in Table 4 .

The types and rates of specific cancers were those expected in a highly immunodeficient population ( many had CD4 + counts below 50 cells / mm3 and most had prior AIDS diagnoses ) .
The risk of developing cancer in these studies was similar in the group receiving ISENTRESS and the group receiving the comparator .
Grade 2 - 4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in subjects treated with ISENTRESS ( see Table 5 ) .
Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported ; however , the relationship of ISENTRESS to these events is not known .
Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis , such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions .
Patients with Co - existing Conditions Patients Co - infected with Hepatitis B and / or Hepatitis C Virus In the randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials , treatment - experienced subjects ( N = 114 / 699 or 16 % ) and treatment - naïve subjects ( N = 34 / 563 or 6 % ) with chronic ( but not acute ) active hepatitis B and / or hepatitis C virus co - infection were permitted to enroll provided that baseline liver function tests did not exceed 5 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) .
In general the safety profile of ISENTRESS in subjects with hepatitis B and / or hepatitis C virus co - infection was similar to that in subjects without hepatitis B and / or hepatitis C virus co - infection , although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were higher in the subgroup with hepatitis B and / or hepatitis C virus co - infection for all treatment groups .
In treatment - experienced subjects , Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST , ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 25 % , 31 % and 12 % , respectively , of co - infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS as compared to 8 % , 7 % and 8 % of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS .
In treatment - naïve subjects , Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST , ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 17 % , 22 % and 11 % , respectively , of co - infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS as compared to 4 % , 4 % and 3 % of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ISENTRESS .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Psychiatric Disorders : anxiety , depression ( particularly in patients with a pre - existing history of psychiatric illness ) , including suicidal ideation and behaviors , paranoia Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : rash , Stevens - Johnson syndrome 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Coadministration of ISENTRESS with drugs that are strong inducers of UGT1A1 may result in reduced plasma concentrations of raltegravir ( 7 . 2 ) .
7 . 1 Effect of Raltegravir on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Agents Raltegravir does not inhibit ( IC50 > 100 µM ) CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 or CYP3A in vitro .
Moreover , in vitro , raltegravir did not induce CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 .
A midazolam drug interaction study confirmed the low propensity of raltegravir to alter the pharmacokinetics of agents metabolized by CYP3A4 in vivo by demonstrating a lack of effect of raltegravir on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam , a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate .
Similarly , raltegravir is not an inhibitor ( IC50 > 50 µM ) of the UDP - glucuronosyltransferases ( UGT ) tested ( UGT1A1 , UGT2B7 ) , and raltegravir does not inhibit P - glycoprotein - mediated transport .
Based on these data , ISENTRESS is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates of these enzymes or P - glycoprotein ( e . g . , protease inhibitors , NNRTIs , opioid analgesics , statins , azole antifungals , proton pump inhibitors and anti - erectile dysfunction agents ) .
In drug interaction studies , raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of the following : hormonal contraceptives , methadone , lamivudine , tenofovir , etravirine .
7 . 2 Effect of Other Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir Raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes .
Based on in vivo and in vitro studies , raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a UGT1A1 - mediated glucuronidation pathway .
Rifampin , a strong inducer of UGT1A1 , reduces plasma concentrations of ISENTRESS .
Therefore , the dose of ISENTRESS should be increased during coadministration with rifampin [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
The impact of other inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes , such as phenytoin and phenobarbital , on UGT1A1 is unknown .
Coadministration of ISENTRESS with drugs that inhibit UGT1A1 may increase plasma levels of raltegravir .
Selected drug interactions are presented in Table 6 [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Table 6 : Selected Drug InteractionsConcomitant Drug Class : Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Raltegravir Clinical Comment HIV - 1 - Antiviral Agents atazanavir ↑ Atazanavir , a strong inhibitor of UGT1A1 , increases plasma concentrations of raltegravir .
However , since concomitant use of ISENTRESS with atazanavir / ritonavir did not result in a unique safety signal in Phase 3 studies , no dose adjustment is recommended .
atazanavir / ritonavir ↑ Atazanavir / ritonavir increases plasma concentrations of raltegravir .
However , since concomitant use of ISENTRESS with atazanavir / ritonavir did not result in a unique safety signal in Phase 3 studies , no dose adjustment is recommended .
efavirenz ↓ Efavirenz reduces plasma concentrations of raltegravir .
The clinical significance of this interaction has not been directly assessed .
etravirine ↓ Etravirine reduces plasma concentrations of raltegravir .
The clinical significance of this interaction has not been directly assessed .
tipranavir / ritonavir ↓ Tipranavir / ritonavir reduces plasma concentrations of raltegravir .
However , since comparable efficacy was observed for this combination relative to other ISENTRESS - containing regimens in Phase 3 studies 018 and 019 , no dose adjustment is recommended .
Other Agents omeprazole ↑ Coadministration of medicinal products that increase gastric pH ( e . g . , omeprazole ) may increase raltegravir levels based on increased raltegravir solubility at higher pH . However , since concomitant use of ISENTRESS with proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers did not result in a unique safety signal in Phase 3 studies , no dose adjustment is recommended .
rifampin ↓ Rifampin , a strong inducer of UGT1A1 , reduces plasma concentrations of raltegravir .
The recommended dosage of ISENTRESS is 800 mg twice daily during coadministration with rifampin .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : • ISENTRESS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Physicians are encouraged to register pregnant women exposed to ISENTRESS by calling 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 so that Merck can monitor maternal and fetal outcomes ( 8 . 1 ) .
Nursing Mothers : • Breast - feeding is not recommended while taking ISENTRESS ( 8 . 3 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C ISENTRESS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
In addition , there have been no pharmacokinetic studies conducted in pregnant patients .
Developmental toxicity studies were performed in rabbits ( at oral doses up to 1000 mg / kg / day ) and rats ( at oral doses up to 600 mg / kg / day ) .
The reproductive toxicity study in rats was performed with pre - , peri - , and postnatal evaluation .
The highest doses in these studies produced systemic exposures in these species approximately 3 - to 4 - fold the exposure at the recommended human dose .
In both rabbits and rats , no treatment - related effects on embryonic / fetal survival or fetal weights were observed .
In addition , no treatment - related external , visceral , or skeletal changes were observed in rabbits .
However , treatment - related increases over controls in the incidence of supernumerary ribs were seen in rats at 600 mg / kg / day ( exposures 3 - fold the exposure at the recommended human dose ) .
Placenta transfer of drug was demonstrated in both rats and rabbits .
At a maternal dose of 600 mg / kg / day in rats , mean drug concentrations in fetal plasma were approximately 1 . 5 - to 2 . 5 - fold greater than in maternal plasma at 1 hour and 24 hours postdose , respectively .
Mean drug concentrations in fetal plasma were approximately 2 % of the mean maternal concentration at both 1 and 24 hours postdose at a maternal dose of 1000 mg / kg / day in rabbits .
Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry To monitor maternal - fetal outcomes of pregnant patients exposed to ISENTRESS , an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established .
Physicians are encouraged to register patients by calling 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Breast - feeding is not recommended while taking ISENTRESS .
In addition , it is recommended that HIV - 1 - infected mothers not breast - feed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV - 1 .
It is not known whether raltegravir is secreted in human milk .
However , raltegravir is secreted in the milk of lactating rats .
Mean drug concentrations in milk were approximately 3 - fold greater than those in maternal plasma at a maternal dose of 600 mg / kg / day in rats .
There were no effects in rat offspring attributable to exposure of ISENTRESS through the milk .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ISENTRESS in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ISENTRESS did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and healthy subjects were observed .
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with severe renal impairment and healthy subjects were observed .
No dosage adjustment is necessary [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with ISENTRESS .
Doses as high as 1600 - mg single dose and 800 - mg twice - daily multiple doses were studied in healthy volunteers without evidence of toxicity .
Occasional doses of 1800 mg per day were taken in the clinical studies of HIV - 1 infected subjects without evidence of toxicity .
In the event of an overdose , it is reasonable to employ the standard supportive measures , e . g . , remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract , employ clinical monitoring ( including obtaining an electrocardiogram ) , and institute supportive therapy if required .
The extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown .
11 DESCRIPTION ISENTRESS contains raltegravir potassium , a human immunodeficiency virus integrase strand transfer inhibitor .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Raltegravir is an HIV - 1 antiviral drug [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In a monotherapy study raltegravir ( 400 mg twice daily ) demonstrated rapid antiviral activity with mean viral load reduction of 1 . 66 log10 copies / mL by Day 10 .
In the randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , dose - ranged trial , Protocol 005 , and Protocols 018 and 019 , antiviral responses were similar among subjects regardless of dose .
Effects on Electrocardiogram In a randomized , placebo - controlled , crossover study , 31 healthy subjects were administered a single oral supratherapeutic dose of raltegravir 1600 mg and placebo .
Peak raltegravir plasma concentrations were approximately 4 - fold higher than the peak concentrations following a 400 mg dose .
ISENTRESS did not appear to prolong the QTc interval for 12 hours postdose .
After baseline and placebo adjustment , the maximum mean QTc change was - 0 . 4 msec ( 1 - sided 95 % upper Cl : 3 . 1 msec ) .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Raltegravir is absorbed with a Tmax of approximately 3 hours postdose in the fasted state .
Raltegravir AUC and Cmax increase dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1600 mg .
Raltegravir C12hr increases dose proportionally over the dose range of 100 to 800 mg and increases slightly less than dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1600 mg .
With twice - daily dosing , pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved within approximately the first 2 days of dosing .
There is little to no accumulation in AUC and Cmax .
The average accumulation ratio for C12hr ranged from approximately 1 . 2 to 1 . 6 .
The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established .
In subjects who received 400 mg twice daily alone , raltegravir drug exposures were characterized by a geometric mean AUC0 - 12 hr of 14 . 3 μM ● hr and C12hr of 142 nM .
Considerable variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir .
For observed C12hr in Protocols 018 and 019 , the coefficient of variation ( CV ) for inter - subject variability = 212 % and the CV for intra - subject variability = 122 % .
Effect of Food on Oral Absorption ISENTRESS may be administered with or without food .
Raltegravir was administered without regard to food in the pivotal safety and efficacy studies in HIV - 1 - infected patients .
The effect of consumption of low - , moderate - and high - fat meals on steady - state raltegravir pharmacokinetics was assessed in healthy volunteers .
Administration of multiple doses of raltegravir following a moderate - fat meal ( 600 Kcal , 21 g fat ) did not affect raltegravir AUC to a clinically meaningful degree with an increase of 13 % relative to fasting .
Raltegravir C12hr was 66 % higher and Cmax was 5 % higher following a moderate - fat meal compared to fasting .
Administration of raltegravir following a high - fat meal ( 825 Kcal , 52 g fat ) increased AUC and Cmax by approximately 2 - fold and increased C12hr by 4 . 1 - fold .
Administration of raltegravir following a low - fat meal ( 300 Kcal , 2 . 5 g fat ) decreased AUC and Cmax by 46 % and 52 % , respectively ; C12hr was essentially unchanged .
Food appears to increase pharmacokinetic variability relative to fasting .
Distribution Raltegravir is approximately 83 % bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to 10 µM .
Metabolism and Excretion The apparent terminal half - life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours , with a shorter α - phase half - life ( ~ 1 hour ) accounting for much of the AUC .
Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled raltegravir , approximately 51 and 32 % of the dose was excreted in feces and urine , respectively .
In feces , only raltegravir was present , most of which is likely derived from hydrolysis of raltegravir - glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species .
Two components , namely raltegravir and raltegravir - glucuronide , were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and 23 % of the dose , respectively .
The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented approximately 70 % of the total radioactivity ; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for by raltegravir - glucuronide .
Studies using isoform - selective chemical inhibitors and cDNA - expressed UDP - glucuronosyltransferases ( UGT ) show that UGT1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the formation of raltegravir - glucuronide .
Thus , the data indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1 - mediated glucuronidation .
Special Populations Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in pediatric patients has not been established .
Age The effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir was evaluated in the composite analysis .
No dosage adjustment is necessary .
Race The effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir was evaluated in the composite analysis .
No dosage adjustment is necessary .
Gender A study of the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir was performed in young healthy males and females .
Additionally , the effect of gender was evaluated in a composite analysis of pharmacokinetic data from 103 healthy subjects and 28 HIV - 1 infected subjects receiving raltegravir monotherapy with fasted administration .
No dosage adjustment is necessary .
Hepatic Impairment Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver .
A study of the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir was performed in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment .
Additionally , hepatic impairment was evaluated in the composite pharmacokinetic analysis .
There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and healthy subjects .
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied .
Renal Impairment Renal clearance of unchanged drug is a minor pathway of elimination .
A study of the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir was performed in subjects with severe renal impairment .
Additionally , renal impairment was evaluated in the composite pharmacokinetic analysis .
There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with severe renal impairment and healthy subjects .
No dosage adjustment is necessary .
Because the extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown , dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided .
UGT1A1 Polymorphism There is no evidence that common UGT1A1 polymorphisms alter raltegravir pharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful extent .
In a comparison of 30 subjects with * 28 / * 28 genotype ( associated with reduced activity of UGT1A1 ) to 27 subjects with wild - type genotype , the geometric mean ratio ( 90 % CI ) of AUC was 1 . 41 ( 0 . 96 , 2 . 09 ) .

Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion , or integration , of unintegrated linear HIV - 1 DNA into the host cell genome preventing the formation of the HIV - 1 provirus .
The provirus is required to direct the production of progeny virus , so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral infection .
Raltegravir did not significantly inhibit human phosphoryltransferases including DNA polymerases α , β , and γ .
Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 ± 20 nM resulted in 95 % inhibition ( EC95 ) of viral spread ( relative to an untreated virus - infected culture ) in human T - lymphoid cell cultures infected with the cell - line adapted HIV - 1 variant H9IIIB .
In addition , 5 clinical isolates of HIV - 1 subtype B had EC95 values ranging from 9 to 19 nM in cultures of mitogen - activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
In a single - cycle infection assay , raltegravir inhibited infection of 23 HIV - 1 isolates representing 5 non - B subtypes ( A , C , D , F , and G ) and 5 circulating recombinant forms ( AE , AG , BF , BG , and cpx ) with EC50 values ranging from 5 to 12 nM .
Raltegravir also inhibited replication of an HIV - 2 isolate when tested in CEMx174 cells ( EC95 value = 6 nM ) .
Additive to synergistic antiretroviral activity was observed when human T - lymphoid cells infected with the H9IIIB variant of HIV - 1 were incubated with raltegravir in combination with non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( delavirdine , efavirenz , or nevirapine ) ; nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( abacavir , didanosine , lamivudine , stavudine , tenofovir , zalcitabine , or zidovudine ) ; protease inhibitors ( amprenavir , atazanavir , indinavir , lopinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , or saquinavir ) ; or the entry inhibitor enfuvirtide .
Resistance The mutations observed in the HIV - 1 integrase coding sequence that contributed to raltegravir resistance ( evolved either in cell culture or in subjects treated with raltegravir ) generally included an amino acid substitution at either Q148 ( changed to H , K , or R ) or N155 ( changed to H ) plus one or more additional substitutions ( i . e . , L74M , E92Q , T97A , E138A / K , G140A / S , V151I , G163R , H183P , Y226C / D / F / H , S230R and D232N ) .
Amino acid substitution at Y143C / H / R is another pathway to raltegravir resistance .
Treatment - Naïve Subjects : By Week 48 in the STARTMRK trial , the primary raltegravir resistance - associated substitutions were observed in 3 ( 1 with Y143R and 2 with Q148H / R ) of the 6 virologic failure subjects with evaluable paired genotypic data .
Treatment - Experienced Subjects : By Week 48 in the BENCHMRK trials , at least one of the 3 primary raltegravir resistance - associated substitutions , Y143C / H / R , Q148H / K / R , and N155H , was observed in 63 ( 64 . 3 % ) of the 98 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment - failure isolates .
Some ( n = 18 ) of those HIV - 1 isolates harboring one or more of the 3 primary raltegravir resistance - associated substitutions were evaluated for raltegravir susceptibility yielding a median decrease of 47 . 3 - fold ( mean 73 . 1 ± 60 . 8 - fold decrease , ranging from 0 . 9 - to 200 - fold ) compared to baseline isolates .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies of raltegravir in mice did not show any carcinogenic potential .
At the highest dose levels , 400 mg / kg / day in females and 250 mg / kg / day in males , systemic exposure was 1 . 8 - fold ( females ) or 1 . 2 - fold ( males ) greater than the AUC ( 54 µM ● hr ) at the 400 - mg twice daily human dose .
Treatment - related squamous cell carcinoma of nose / nasopharynx was observed in female rats dosed with 600 mg / kg / day raltegravir for 104 weeks .
These tumors were possibly the result of local irritation and inflammation due to local deposition and / or aspiration of drug in the mucosa of the nose / nasopharynx during dosing .
No tumors of the nose / nasopharynx were observed in rats dosed with 150 mg / kg / day ( males ) and 50 mg / kg / day ( females ) and the systemic exposure in rats was 1 . 7 - fold ( males ) to 1 . 4 - fold ( females ) greater than the AUC ( 54 μM ● hr ) at the 400 - mg twice daily human dose .
No evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis ( Ames ) tests , in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal aberration studies .
No effect on fertility was seen in male and female rats at doses up to 600 mg / kg / day which resulted in 3 . 0 - fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Description of Clinical Studies The evidence of durable efficacy of ISENTRESS is based on the analyses of 48 - week data from an ongoing , randomized , double - blind , active - control trial , STARTMRK ( Protocol 021 ) in antiretroviral treatment - naive HIV - 1 infected adult subjects and from 2 ongoing , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled studies , BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 ( Protocols 018 and 019 ) , in antiretroviral treatment - experienced HIV - 1 infected adult subjects .
These efficacy results were supported by the 96 - week analysis of a randomized , double - blind , controlled , dose - ranging trial , Protocol 004 , in antiretroviral treatment - naïve HIV - 1 infected adult subjects and by the 48 - week analysis of a randomized , double - blind , controlled , dose - ranging study , Protocol 005 , in antiretroviral treatment - experienced HIV - 1 infected adult subjects .
Treatment - Naïve Subjects STARTMRK ( Protocol 021 ) is a Phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and antiretroviral activity of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily + emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir versus efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime plus emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir in treatment - naïve HIV - 1 - infected subjects with HIV - 1 RNA > 5000 copies / mL .
Randomization was stratified by screening HIV - 1 RNA level ( ≤ 50 , 000 copies / mL ; and > 50 , 000 copies / mL ) and by hepatitis status .

What is ISENTRESS ?
• ISENTRESS is an anti - HIV ( antiretroviral ) medicine used for the treatment of HIV .
The term HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus .
It is the virus that causes AIDS ( Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ) .
ISENTRESS is used along with other anti - HIV medicines .
ISENTRESS will NOT cure HIV infection .
• People taking ISENTRESS may still develop infections , including opportunistic infections or other conditions that happen with HIV infection .
• Stay under the care of your doctor during treatment with ISENTRESS .
• The safety and effectiveness of ISENTRESS in children has not been studied .
ISENTRESS must be used with other anti - HIV medicines .
How does ISENTRESS work ?
• ISENTRESS blocks an enzyme which the virus ( HIV ) needs in order to make more virus .
The enzyme that ISENTRESS blocks is called HIV integrase .
• When used with other anti - HIV medicines , ISENTRESS may do two things : • Reduce the amount of HIV in your blood .
This is called your " viral load " .
• Increase the number of white blood cells called CD4 ( T ) cells .
• ISENTRESS may not have these effects in all patients .
Does ISENTRESS lower the chance of passing HIV to other people ?
No .
ISENTRESS does not reduce the chance of passing HIV to others through sexual contact , sharing needles , or being exposed to your blood .
• Continue to practice safer sex .
• Use latex or polyurethane condoms or other barrier methods to lower the chance of sexual contact with any body fluids .
