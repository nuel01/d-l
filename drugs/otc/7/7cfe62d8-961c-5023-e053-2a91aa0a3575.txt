DESCRIPTION Each five - sided dye free MOTOFEN ® tablet contains : 1 mg of difenoxin ( equivalent to 1 . 09 mg of difenoxin hydrochloride ) and 0 . 025 mg of atropine sulfate ( equivalent to 0 . 01 mg of atropine ) .
Difenoxin hydrochloride , 1 - ( 3 - cyano - 3 , 3 - diphenylpropyl ) - 4 - phenyl - 4 - piperidinecarboxylic acid monohydrochloride , is an orally administered antidiarrheal agent which is chemically related to the narcotic meperidine .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Atropine sulfate is present to discourage deliberate overdose .
Atropine sulfate , an anticholinergic , is benzeneacetic acid , α - ( hydroxymethyl ) - , 8 - methyl - 8 - azabicyclo [ 3 . 2 . 1 ] oct - 3 - yl ester , endo - ( ± ) - , ( 2 : 1 ) ( salt ) , monohydrate and has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Inactive Ingredients : calcium stearate , cellulose , lactose , corn starch .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Animal studies have shown that difenoxin hydrochloride manifests its antidiarrheal effect by slowing intestinal motility .
The mechanism of action is by a local effect on the gastrointestinal wall .
Difenoxin is the principal active metabolite of diphenoxylate .
Following oral administration of MOTOFEN ® , difenoxin is rapidly and extensively absorbed .
Mean peak plasma levels of approximately 160 ng / mL occurred within 40 to 60 minutes in most patients following an oral dose of 2 mg .
Plasma levels decline to less than 10 % of their peak values within 24 hours and to less than 1 % of their peak values within 72 hours .
This decline parallels the appearance of difenoxin and its metabolites in the urine .
Difenoxin is metabolized to an inactive hydroxylated metabolite .
Both the drug and its metabolites are excreted , mainly as conjugates , in urine and feces .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE MOTOFEN ® is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the management of acute nonspecific diarrhea and acute exacerbations of chronic functional diarrhea .
CONTRAINDICATIONS MOTOFEN ® is contraindicated in patients with diarrhea associated with organisms that penetrate the intestinal mucosa ( toxigenic E . coli , Salmonella species , Shigella ) and pseudomembranous colitis associated with broad spectrum antibiotics .
Antiperistaltic agents should not be used in the conditions because they may prolong and / or worsen diarrhea .
MOTOFEN ® is contraindicated in children under 2 years of age because of the decreased margin of safety of drugs in this class in younger age groups .
MOTOFEN ® is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to difenoxin , atropine , or any of the inactive ingredients , and in patients who are jaundiced .
WARNINGS MOTOFEN ® IS NOT AN INNOCUOUS DRUG AND DOSAGE RECOMMENDATIONS SHOULD BE STRICTLY ADHERED TO .
MOTOFEN ® IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN UNDER 2 YEARS OF AGE .
OVERDOSAGE MAY RESULT IN SEVERE RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AND COMA , POSSIBLY LEADING TO PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE OR DEATH ( SEE OVERDOSAGE ) .
THEREFORE , KEEP THIS MEDICATION OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN .
FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE BALANCE – THE USE OF MOTOFEN ® DOES NOT PRECLUDE THE ADMINISTRATION OF APPROPRIATE FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE THERAPY .
DEHYDRATION , PARTICULARLY IN CHILDREN , MAY FURTHER INFLUENCE THE VARIABILITY OF RESPONSE TO MOTOFEN ® AND MAY PREDISPOSE TO DELAYED DIFENOXIN INTOXICATION .
DRUG - INDUCED INHIBITION OF PERISTALSIS MAY RESULT IN FLUID RETENTION IN THE COLON , AND THIS MAY FURTHER AGGRAVATE DEHYDRATION AND ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCE .
IF SEVERE DEHYDRATION OR ELECTROLYTE IMBALANCE IS MANIFESTED , MOTOFEN ® SHOULD BE WITHHELD UNTIL APPROPRIATE CORRECTIVE THERAPY HAS BEEN INITIATED .
Ulcerative Colitis – In some patients with acute ulcerative colitis , agents which inhibit intestinal motility or delay intestinal transit time have been reported to induce toxic megacolon .
Consequently , patients with acute ulcerative colitis should be carefully observed and MOTOFEN ® therapy should be discontinued promptly if abdominal distention occurs or if other untoward symptoms develop .
Liver and Kidney Disease – MOTOFEN ® should be used with extreme caution in patients with advanced hepatorenal disease and in all patients with abnormal liver function tests since hepatic coma may be precipitated .
Atropine – A subtherapeutic dose of atropine has been added to difenoxin hydrochloride to discourage deliberate overdosage .
Usage of MOTOFEN ® in recommended doses is not likely to cause prominent anticholinergic side effects , but MOTOFEN ® should be avoided in patients in whom anticholinergic drugs are contraindicated .
The warnings and precautions for use of anticholinergic agents should be observed .
In children , signs of atropinism may occur even with recommended doses of MOTOFEN ® , particularly in patients with Down ’ s Syndrome .
PRECAUTIONS CAUTION PATIENTS TO ADHERE STRICTLY TO RECOMMENDED DOSAGE SCHEDULES .
THE MEDICATION SHOULD BE KEPT OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN SINCE ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSAGE MAY RESULT IN SEVERE , EVEN FATAL , RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION .
MOTOFEN ® may produce drowsiness or dizziness .
The patient should be cautioned regarding activities requiring mental alertness , such as driving or operating dangerous machinery .
Drug Interactions Since the chemical structure of difenoxin hydrochloride is similar to meperidine hydrochloride , the concurrent use of MOTOFEN ® with monoamine oxidase inhibitors may , in theory , precipitate a hypertensive crisis .
MOTOFEN ® may potentiate the action of barbiturates , tranquilizers , narcotics , and alcohol .
When these medications are used concomitantly with MOTOFEN ® , the patient should be closely monitored .
Diphenoxylate hydrochloride , from which the principal active metabolite difenoxin is derived , was found to inhibit the hepatic microsomal enzyme system at a dose of 2 mg / kg / day in studies conducted with male rats .
Therefore , difenoxin has the potential to prolong the biological half - lives of drugs for which the rate of elimination is dependent on the microsomal drug metabolizing enzyme system .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagensis , Impairment of Fertility No evidence of carcinogenesis was found in a long - term study of difenoxin hydrochloride / atropine in the rat .
In this 104 week study , rats received dietary doses of 0 , 1 . 25 , 2 . 5 , or 5 mg / kg / day difenoxin / atropine ( 20 : 1 ratio ) .
No experiments have been conducted to determine the mutagenic potential of MOTOFEN ® .
MOTOFEN ® did not significantly impair fertility in rats .
Pregnancy / Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C . Reproduction studies in rats and rabbits with doses at 31 and 61 times the human therapeutic dose respectively , on a mg / kg basis , demonstrated no evidence of teratogenesis due to MOTOFEN ® .
Pregnant rats receiving oral doses of difenoxin hydrochloride / atropine 20 times the maximum human dose had an increase in delivery time as well as a significant increase in the percent of stillbirths .
Neonatal survival in rats was also reduced with most deaths occurring within four days of delivery .
There are no well controlled studies in pregnant women .
MOTOFEN ® should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus .
Nursing Mothers Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from MOTOFEN ® , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
Pediatric Use SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS IN CHILDREN BELOW THE AGE OF 12 HAVE NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED .
MOTOFEN ® IS CONTRAINDICATED IN CHILDREN UNDER 2 YEARS OF AGE .
See OVERDOSAGE section for information on hazards from accidental poisoning in children .
ADVERSE REACTIONS In view of the small amount of atropine present ( 0 . 025 mg / tablet ) , such effects such as dryness of the skin and mucous membranes , flushing , hyperthermia , tachycardia and urinary retention are very unlikely to occur , except perhaps in children .
Many of the adverse effects reported during clinical investigation of MOTOFEN ® are difficult to distinguish from symptoms associated with the diarrheal syndrome .
However , the following events were reported at the stated frequencies : Gastrointestinal : Nausea , 1 in 15 patients ; vomiting , 1 in 30 patients ; dry mouth , 1 in 30 patients ; epigastric distress , 1 in 100 patients ; and constipation , 1 in 300 patients .
Central Nervous System : Dizziness and light - headedness , 1 in 20 patients ; drowsiness , 1 in 25 patients ; and headache , 1 in 40 patients ; tiredness , nervousness , insomnia and confusion ranged from 1 in 200 to 1 in 600 patients .
Other less frequent reactions : Burning eyes and blurred vision occurred in a few cases .
The following adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving chemically - related drugs : numbness of extremities , euphoria , depression , sedation , anaphylaxis , angioneurotic edema , urticaria , swelling of the gums , pruritus , toxic megacolon , paralytic ileus , pancreatitis , and anorexia .
THIS MEDICATION SHOULD BE KEPT IN A CHILD - RESISTANT CONTAINER AND OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN SINCE AN OVERDOSAGE MAY RESULT IN SEVERE RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION AND COMA , POSSIBLY LEADING TO PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE OR DEATH .
DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE MOTOFEN ® tablets are a Schedule IV controlled substance .
Addiction to ( dependence on ) difenoxin hydrochloride is theoretically possible at high dosage .
Therefore , the recommended dosage should not be exceeded .
Because of the structural and pharmacological similarities of difenoxin hydrochloride to drugs with a definite addiction potential , MOTOFEN ® should be administered with considerable caution to patients who are receiving addicting drugs , to individuals known to be addiction prone , or to those in whom histories suggest may increase dosage on their own initiative .
Diagnosis and Treatment In the event of overdosage ( initial signs may include dryness of the skin and mucous membranes , flushing , hyperthermia and tachycardia followed by lethargy or coma , hypotonic reflexes , nystagmus , pinpoint pupils and respiratory depression ) gastric lavage , establishment of a patent airway and possibly mechanically assisted respiration are advised .
The narcotic antagonist naloxone may be used in the treatment of respiratory depression caused by narcotic analgesics of pharmacologically related compounds such as MOTOFEN ® tablets .
When naloxone is administered intravenously , the onset of action is generally apparent within two minutes .
Naloxone may be administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly providing a slightly less rapid onset of action but a more prolonged effect .
To counteract respiratory depression caused by MOTOFEN ® overdosage , the following dosage schedule for naloxone should be followed : Adult Dosage : The usual initial adult dose of naloxone is 0 . 4 mg ( one mL ) administered intravenously .
If respiratory function does not adequately improve after the initial dose , the same IV dose may be repeated at two - to - three minute intervals .
Children : The usual adult dose of naloxone for children is 0 . 01 mg / kg of body weight administered intravenously and repeated at two - to - three minute intervals if necessary .
Since the duration of action of difenoxin hydrochloride is longer than that of naloxone , improvement of respiration following administration may be followed by recurrent respiratory depression .
Consequently , continuous observation is necessary until the effect of difenoxin hydrochloride on respiration ( which effect may persist for many hours ) has passed .
Supplemental intramuscular doses of naloxone may be utilized to produce a longer lasting effect .
TREAT ALL POSSIBLE MOTOFEN ® OVERDOSAGES AS SERIOUS AND MAINTAIN MEDICAL OBSERVATION FOR AT LEAST 48 HOURS , PREFERABLY UNDER CONTINUOUS HOSPITAL CARE .
Although signs of overdosage and respiratory depression may not be evident soon after ingestion of difenoxin hydrochloride , respiratory depression may occur from 12 to 30 hours later .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended starting dose of MOTOFEN ® tablets in adults is 2 tablets then 1 tablet after each loose stool or 1 tablet every 3 to 4 hours as needed , but the total dosage during any 24 - hour treatment period should not exceed 8 tablets .
In the treatment of diarrhea , if clinical improvement is not observed in 48 hours , continued administration of this type of medication is not recommended .
For acute diarrheas and acute exacerbations of functional diarrhea , treatment beyond 48 hours is usually not necessary .
Studies in children below the age of 12 have been inadequate to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MOTOFEN ® in this age group .
MOTOFEN ® is contraindicated in children under 2 years of age .
