Justification for Emergency Use of Drugs During the COVID - 19 Pandemic There is currently an outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) caused by SARS - CoV - 2 , a novel coronavirus .
The Secretary of HHS has declared that : • A public health emergency related to COVID - 19 has existed since January 27 , 2020 .
• Circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID - 19 pandemic ( March 27 , 2020 declaration ) .
An EUA is a FDA authorization for the emergency use of an unapproved product or unapproved use of an approved product ( i . e . , drug , biological product , or device ) in the United States under certain circumstances including , but not limited to , when the Secretary of HHS declares that there is a public health emergency that affects the national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad , and that involves biological agent ( s ) or a disease or condition that may be attributable to such agent ( s ) .
Criteria for issuing an EUA include : • The biological agent ( s ) can cause a serious or life - threatening disease or condition ; • Based on the totality of the available scientific evidence ( including data from adequate and well - controlled clinical trials , if available ) , it is reasonable to believe that • the product may be effective in diagnosing , treating , or preventing the serious or life - threatening disease or condition ; and • The known and potential benefits of the product - when used to diagnose , prevent , or treat such disease or condition - outweigh the known and potential risks of the product , taking into consideration the material threat posed by the biological agent ( s ) ; • There is no adequate , approved , and available alternative to the product for diagnosing , preventing , or treating the serious or life - threatening disease or condition .
Information Regarding Available Alternatives for the EUA Authorized Use Veklury ( remdesivir ) is FDA - approved for the treatment of COVID - 19 in adults and pediatric patients ( 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg ) with positive results of direct SARS - CoV - 2 viral testing , who are not hospitalized and have mild - to - moderate COVID - 19 , and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID - 19 , including hospitalization or death .
Veklury is administered via intravenous infusion for a total treatment duration of 3 days .
Although Veklury is an approved alternative treatment of mild - to - moderate COVID - 19 in adults and pediatric patients ( 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg ) with positive results of direct SARS - CoV - 2 viral testing , and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID - 19 , including hospitalization or death , FDA does not consider Veklury to be an adequate alternative to bebtelovimab for this authorized use because it may not be feasible or practical for certain patients ( e . g . , it requires a 3 - day treatment duration ) .
Other therapeutics are currently authorized for the same use as bebtelovimab .
For additional information on all products authorized for treatment or prevention of COVID - 19 , please see https : / / www . fda . gov / emergency - preparedness - and - response / mcm - legal - regulatory - and - policy - framework / emergency - use - authorization .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Bebtelovimab is not renally excreted or metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes ; therefore , interactions with concomitant medications that are renally excreted or that are substrates , inducers , or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Severe hypersensitivity reactions and infusion - related reactions , have been observed with administration of bebtelovimab , including in pregnant patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated COVID - 19 in pregnancy as well as potential risks to the fetus associated with severe maternal hypersensitivity and infusion - related reactions ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
There are insufficient data to evaluate a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Bebtelovimab should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk for the mother and the fetus .
There are maternal and fetal risks associated with untreated COVID - 19 in pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
Data Nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies have not been performed with bebtelovimab .
In tissue cross reactivity studies using human fetal tissues , no binding of clinical concern was detected for bebtelovimab .
Human immunoglobulin G1 ( IgG1 ) antibodies are known to cross the placental barrier ; therefore , bebtelovimab has the potential to be transferred from the mother to the developing fetus .
It is unknown whether the potential transfer of bebtelovimab provides any treatment benefit or risk to the developing fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo - fetal risk COVID - 19 in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes , including preeclampsia , eclampsia , preterm birth , premature rupture of membranes , venous thromboembolic disease , and fetal death .
Maternal Adverse Reactions Pregnant patients who develop severe hypersensitivity and infusion - related reactions should be managed appropriately , including obstetrical care [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no available data on the presence of bebtelovimab in human or animal milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for bebtelovimab and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from bebtelovimab or from the underlying maternal condition .
Breastfeeding individuals with COVID - 19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID - 19 .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Bebtelovimab is not authorized for use in pediatric individuals under 12 years of age or weighing less than 40 kg .
The safety and effectiveness of bebtelovimab have not been assessed in pediatric patients .
The recommended dosing regimen in patients 12 years to less than 18 years of age , weighing at least 40 kg , is expected to result in comparable serum exposures of bebtelovimab as those observed in adults .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 602 patients receiving bebtelovimab in BLAZE - 4 , 10 . 5 % were 65 years of age and older and 3 . 3 % were 75 years of age and older .
Based on population PK analyses of samples from 573 patients over an age range of 14 to 89 years , there was no impact of age on PK .
Therefore , there is no difference in the PK of bebtelovimab in geriatric patients compared to younger patients .
10 OVERDOSAGE Doses up to 1750 mg of bebtelovimab ( 10 times the authorized dose of bebtelovimab ) have been administered in clinical trials without dose - limiting toxicity .
Treatment of overdose with bebtelovimab should consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient .
There is no specific antidote for overdose with bebtelovimab .
11 DESCRIPTION Bebtelovimab is a human immunoglobulin G - 1 ( IgG1 variant ) monoclonal antibody consisting of 2 identical light chain polypeptides composed of 215 amino acids each and 2 identical heavy chain polypeptides composed of 449 amino acids produced by a Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) stable bulk culture or cell line with a molecular weight of 144 kDa .
Bebtelovimab injection is a sterile , preservative - free , clear to opalescent and colorless to slightly yellow to slightly brown solution in a single - dose vial for intravenous injection .
Each mL contains 87 . 5 mg of bebtelovimab , L - histidine ( 0 . 4 mg ) , L - histidine hydrochloride monohydrate ( 0 . 6 mg ) , sodium chloride ( 2 . 9 mg ) , sucrose ( 60 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 0 . 5 mg ) , and Water for Injection .
The bebtelovimab solution has a pH range of 5 . 5 - 6 . 5 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Bebtelovimab is a recombinant neutralizing human IgG1λ monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) to the spike protein of SARS - CoV - 2 and is unmodified in the Fc region .
Bebtelovimab binds the spike protein with a dissociation constant KD = 0 . 046 to 0 . 075 nM and blocks spike protein attachment to the human ACE2 receptor with an IC50 value of 0 . 39 nM ( 0 . 056 mcg / mL ) .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure - response relationships of bebtelovimab for viral loads and clinical outcomes are unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics A summary of PK parameters of bebtelovimab following administration of a single dose of 175 mg bebtelovimab is provided in Table 1 .
Table 1 : Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Bebtelovimab Administered IV in Adults and Pediatric Patients ( 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg ) Abbreviations : CV = coefficient of variation ; Cmax = maximum concentration ; Cday , 29 = drug concentration on day 29 ; AUCinf = area under the concentration versus time curve from zero to infinity ; Vss = steady - state volume of distribution .
Bebtelovimab ( 175 mg ) N = 585 Systemic Exposure Geometric Mean ( % CV ) Cmax , mcg / mL 59 . 9 ( 31 . 9 ) Geometric Mean ( % CV ) Cday 29 , mcg / mL 4 . 55 ( 70 . 9 ) Geometric Mean ( % CV ) AUCinf , mcg day / mL 539 ( 41 . 5 ) Distribution Geometric Mean ( % CV ) Vss ( L ) 4 . 55 ( 25 . 8 ) Elimination Geometric Mean ( % CV ) Elimination Half - Life ( day ) 11 . 5 ( 27 . 0 ) Geometric Mean ( % CV ) Clearance ( L / day ) 0 . 325 ( 41 . 5 ) Specific Populations : The PK profile of bebtelovimab was not affected by age , sex , race , or baseline viral load based on a population PK analysis .
Body weight had no clinically relevant effect on the PK of bebtelovimab in adults with COVID - 19 over the body weight range of 45 kg to 194 kg .
Patients with renal impairment Renal impairment is not expected to impact the PK of bebtelovimab , since mAbs with molecular weight > 69 kDa are known not to undergo renal elimination .
Similarly , dialysis is not expected to impact the PK of bebtelovimab .
Patients with hepatic impairment Bebtelovimab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as other IgG monoclonal antibodies and human endogenous IgG antibodies .
Based on population PK analysis , there is no significant difference in PK of bebtelovimab in patients with mild hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function .
Bebtelovimab has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment .
Drug Interactions : Bebtelovimab is not renally excreted or metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes ; therefore , interactions with concomitant medications that are renally excreted or that are substrates , inducers , or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely .
12 . 4 Microbiology Antiviral Activity The cell culture neutralization activity of bebtelovimab against SARS - CoV - 2 was measured in a dose - response model quantifying plaque reduction using cultured Vero E6 cells .
Bebtelovimab neutralized the USA / WA / 1 / 2020 isolate of SARS - CoV - 2 with an estimated EC50 value = 0 . 044 nM ( 6 . 4 ng / mL ) .
Bebtelovimab demonstrated antibody - dependent cell - mediated cytotoxicity on Jurkat reporter cells expressing FcγRIIIa following engagement with target cells expressing spike protein .
Bebtelovimab did not elicit complement - dependent cytotoxicity activity in cell - based assays .
Antibody Dependent Enhancement ( ADE ) of Infection The risk that bebtelovimab could mediate viral uptake and replication by immune cells was studied in THP - 1 and Raji cell lines and primary human macrophages .
In general , experiments with bebtelovimab did not demonstrate productive viral infection in immune cells exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 at concentrations of mAb down to 60 , 000 - fold below the approximate EC50 value for neutralization .
Antiviral Resistance There is a potential risk of treatment failure due to the development of viral variants that are resistant to bebtelovimab .
Nonclinical selection studies using a directed evolution of a yeast displayed Spike RBD identified that substitutions at residues K444 , V445 , G446 , and P499 interfered with bebtelovimab ' s ability to block the Spike RBD : ACE - 2 interaction .
Pseudotyped virus - like particle ( VLP ) neutralization assays confirmed a 5 - fold or greater reduction in susceptibility to bebtelovimab of viral variants with the following substitutions : K444E ( > 862 ) , K444N ( > 1 , 901 - fold ) , K444Q ( 208 - fold ) , K444T ( > 1 , 814 - fold ) , V445A ( 111 - fold ) , V445F ( 369 - fold ) , V445G ( > 730 - fold ) , G446D ( 69 - fold ) , G446R ( 7 - fold ) , G446V ( 8 - fold ) , P499H ( > 1 , 606 - fold ) , P499R ( > 1 , 870 - fold ) , and P499S ( 25 - fold ) .
In the context of Delta spike protein , G446V substitution had reduced susceptibility of 16 . 4 - fold .
Pseudotyped VLP assessment using the full - length spike genes from different variant lineages indicate that bebtelovimab retains activity ( < 5 - fold reduction ) against the Alpha ( B . 1 . 1 . 7 , UK origin ) , Beta ( B . 1 . 351 , South Africa origin ) , Gamma ( P . 1 , Brazil origin ) , Delta ( B . 1 . 617 . 2 , India origin ) , Delta [ + K417N ] ( AY . 1 / AY . 2 , India origin ) , Epsilon ( B . 1 . 427 / B . 1 . 429 , California origin ) , Iota ( B . 1 . 526 , New York origin ) , Kappa ( B . 1 . 617 . 1 , India origin ) , Lambda ( C . 37 , Peru origin ) , Omicron ( B . 1 . 1 . 529 / BA . 1 , South Africa origin ) , Omicron [ + R346K ] ( BA . 1 . 1 ) , Omicron BA . 2 , Omicron BA . 2 [ + L452Q ] ( BA . 2 . 12 . 1 ) , Omicron BA . 2 [ + D339H , G446S , N460K , R493Q ( reversion ) ] ( BA . 2 . 75 ) , and Omicron BA . 4 / BA . 5 variant lineages ( Table 2 ) .
The Mu ( B . 1 . 621 , Colombia origin ) variant showed a reduction in susceptibility to bebtelovimab of 5 . 3 - fold .

Pseudotyped VLP contained the full - length spike protein reflective of the consensus sequence for each of the variant lineages .
b No change : < 5 - fold reduction in susceptibility .
c Isolates of the B . 1 . 526 lineage harbor several spike protein amino acid substitutions , and not all isolates contain the E484K substitution ( as of February 2021 ) .

Baseline sequencing data are available for 611 of the subjects in the BLAZE - 4 ( Arms 9 - 14 ) Study .
Of these , 552 ( 90 . 3 % ) were infected with a variant of interest or concern , as designated by the WHO .
No subject was infected with virus of the Omicron lineage or sub - lineages .
The majority of subjects in the trial were infected with Delta ( 49 . 9 % ) and Alpha ( 28 . 6 % ) .
These were distributed across the treatment groups with Delta and Alpha infection rates of 60 . 2 % and 23 . 1 % in placebo , 31 . 3 % and 41 . 8 % in bebtelovimab alone arms , and 58 . 3 % and 21 . 9 % in the bebtelovimab with bamlanivimab and etesevimab arms , respectively .
Gamma and Mu infections comprised 5 . 6 % and 3 . 8 % of the total infections respectively .
Subjects infected with Beta , Delta [ + K417N ] , Iota , and Lambda variants were the minority with 0 . 5 % , 0 . 8 % , 0 . 7 % , and 0 . 5 % total infections , respectively .
All other subjects in the trial had SARS - CoV - 2 infections from either non - WHO classified viruses ( 3 . 3 % ) , or the lineage was not able to be determined based on the baseline sequence data ( 6 . 4 % ) .
Detection of viral variants with a 5 - fold or greater reduction in susceptibility to bebtelovimab at baseline has been rare , with only one G446V substitution ( 8 - fold shift ) observed transiently out of 611 subjects in the BLAZE - 4 ( Arms 9 - 14 ) study that had baseline sequencing available ( 0 . 2 % , 1 / 611 ) .
Analysis of treatment - emergent variants focused on changes at amino acid positions with known phenotypically confirmed bebtelovimab - associated variations ( i . e . , K444 , V445 , G446 , and P499 ) in serial viral samples obtained in the BLAZE - 4 ( Arms 9 - 14 ) bebtelovimab Phase 2 Study .
Treatment - emergent substitutions detected at ≥ 15 % or ≥ 50 % allele fractions at these positions included K444E / N , V445G , G446V , and P499H / R .
These substitutions resulted in a 5 - fold or greater reduction in susceptibility to bebtelovimab in pseudotyped VLP assays : K444E ( > 862 ) , K444N ( > 1 , 901 - fold ) , V445G ( > 730 - fold ) , G446V ( 8 - fold ) , P499H ( > 1 , 606 - fold ) , and P499R ( > 1 , 870 - fold ) .
Additional treatment - emergent substitutions detected at ≥ 15 % or > 50 % allele fractions outside the epitope in at least 2 subjects included C379F ( n = 2 ) and G404C ( n = 2 ) , seen in bebtelovimab in combination with bamlanivimab and etesevimab arms .
Considering all substitutions detected at ≥ 15 % allele fraction at positions K444 , V445 , G446 , and P499 , 5 . 5 % ( 11 / 199 ) of subjects treated with bebtelovimab alone harbored a variant that was treatment - emergent .
This was more frequent than observed in the placebo arm ( 0 % , 0 / 112 ) , or when bebtelovimab was administered together with bamlanivimab and etesevimab ( 0 . 3 % , 1 / 312 ) .
The appearance of these treatment - emergent bebtelovimab resistance - associated substitutions was associated with higher viral loads in the subjects in whom they were detected , but none of these subjects were hospitalized .
The majority of the variants were first detected on Day 5 ( n = 3 ) and Day 7 ( n = 6 ) following treatment initiation .
It is possible that bebtelovimab resistance - associated variants could have cross - resistance to other mAbs targeting the receptor binding domain of SARS - CoV - 2 .
The clinical impact is not known .
Immune Response Attenuation There is a theoretical risk that antibody administration may attenuate the endogenous immune response to SARS - CoV - 2 and make patients more susceptible to re - infection .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis , mutagenesis , and reproductive toxicology studies with bebtelovimab have not been conducted .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology In toxicology studies , bebtelovimab had no adverse effects when administered intravenously to rats .
In tissue cross reactivity studies using human adult and fetal tissues , no binding of clinical concern was detected for bebtelovimab .
Antiviral Activity In Vivo Prophylactic administration of bebtelovimab to male Syrian golden hamsters ( n = 5 to 8 per group ) resulted in 2 to 4 log10 decreases in viral genomic RNA and viral replication ( subgenomic RNA ) from lung tissue , as well as decreases in lung weight and improvements in body weight compared to controls .
The applicability of these findings to a treatment setting is not known .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The data supporting this EUA for treatment of mild - to - moderate COVID - 19 are primarily based on analyses of data from the Phase 2 portion of the BLAZE - 4 trial ( NCT04634409 ) that enrolled both low risk and high risk subjects ( treatment arms 9 - 14 ) .
This trial evaluated the clinical efficacy data from subjects receiving 175 mg bebtelovimab alone and together with 700 mg bamlanivimab and 1 , 400 mg of etesevimab .
BLAZE - 4 is a Phase 1 / 2 , randomized , single - dose clinical trial evaluating treatment of subjects with mild - to - moderate COVID - 19 ( subjects with COVID - 19 symptoms who are not hospitalized ) .
Efficacy of bebtelovimab , alone and together with bamlanivimab and etesevimab , was evaluated in low risk adults ( i . e . , those not at high - risk to progress to severe COVID - 19 ) in a randomized part of the trial which included a placebo control arm ( treatment arms 9 - 11 ) .
Low risk adults were randomized with a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio .
High - risk adults and pediatric subjects ( 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg ) received open - label active treatments .
One cohort of high risk subjects was randomized with 2 : 1 ratio ( treatment arms 12 and 13 ) .
Another cohort of high risk subject was enrolled with no randomization ( treatment arm 14 ) .
The trial enrolled subjects who were not hospitalized and had 1 or more COVID - 19 symptoms that were at least mild in severity .
Treatment was initiated within 3 days of obtaining the clinical sample for the first positive SARS - CoV - 2 viral infection determination .
BLAZE - 4 was conducted prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant .
No subject in BLAZE - 4 was infected with virus of the Omicron lineage or sub - lineages .
The majority of participants in the trial were infected with Delta ( 49 . 8 % ) and Alpha ( 28 . 6 % ) .
14 . 1 Phase 2 Data from the Placebo - Controlled Portion of BLAZE - 4 ( Low Risk Subjects ; Treatment Arms 9 - 11 ) In this portion of the trial , adult subjects were treated with a single infusion of bamlanivimab 700 mg , etesevimab 1 , 400 mg , and bebtelovimab 175 mg ( N = 127 ) , 175 mg bebtelovimab alone ( N = 125 ) , or placebo ( N = 128 ) .
The majority ( 96 . 8 % ) of the subjects enrolled in these treatment arms did not meet the criteria for high - risk .
At baseline , median age was 35 years ( with 1 placebo subject aged 65 or older ) ; 56 % of subjects were female , 79 % were White , 36 % were Hispanic or Latino , and 19 % were Black or African American .
Subjects had mild ( 74 % ) to moderate ( 26 % ) COVID - 19 ; the mean duration of symptoms was 3 . 6 days ; mean viral load by cycle threshold ( CT ) was 24 . 63 at baseline .
The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across treatment arms with the exception of baseline serology status .
A higher percentage of subjects in the placebo arm were positive for baseline serology ( 15 % vs . 9 % for bamlanivimab , etesevimab , and bebtelovimab together , and 7 % for bebtelovimab alone ) .
Participants enrolled in these treatment arms had not received SARS - CoV - 2 vaccine at baseline .
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with persistently high viral load ( PHVL ) by Day 7 .
PHVL occurred in 26 subjects treated with placebo ( 21 % ) as compared to 16 ( 13 % ) subjects treated with bamlanivimab 700 mg , etesevimab 1 , 400 mg , and bebtelovimab 175 mg together [ p = 0 . 098 ] , and 17 ( 14 % ) subjects treated with bebtelovimab 175 mg alone [ p = 0 . 147 ] , a 38 % ( 95 % CI : - 9 % , 65 % ) and 34 % ( 95 % CI : - 15 % , 62 % ) relative reduction , respectively .
Secondary endpoints included mean change in viral load from baseline to Day 3 , 5 , 7 , and 11 ( Figure 1 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 1 : SARS - CoV - 2 Viral Load Change from Baseline ( Mean ± SE ) by Visit from the Placebo - Controlled Portion of BLAZE - 4 in Low Risk Adults ( 700 mg bamlanivimab , 1 , 400 mg etesevimab , 175 mg bebtelovimab together and 175 mg bebtelovimab alone ) .
For the secondary endpoint of COVID - 19 related hospitalization ( defined as ≥ 24 hours of acute care ) or death by any cause by Day 29 , these events occurred in 2 ( 1 . 6 % ) subjects treated with placebo as compared with 3 ( 2 . 4 % ) events in subjects treated with bamlanivimab 700 mg , etesevimab 1 , 400 mg , and bebtelovimab 175 mg together and 2 ( 1 . 6 % ) events in subjects treated with bebtelovimab 175 mg alone .
There was 1 subject treated with bamlanivimab 700 mg , etesevimab 1 , 400 mg , and bebtelovimab 175 mg together who died on Day 5 .
Conclusions are limited as COVID - 19 related hospitalization and death rates are expected to be low in a low risk population .
The median time to sustained symptom resolution as recorded in a trial specific daily symptom diary was 7 days ( 95 % CI : 6 , 8 days ) for subjects treated with bamlanivimab 700 mg , etesevimab 1 , 400 mg , and bebtelovimab 175 mg together [ p = 0 . 289 ] and 6 days ( 95 % CI : 5 , 7 days ) for subjects treated with bebtelovimab 175 mg alone [ p = 0 . 003 ] as compared with 8 days ( 95 % CI : 7 , 9 days ) for subjects treated with placebo .
Symptoms assessed were cough , shortness of breath , feeling feverish , fatigue , body aches and pains , sore throat , chills , and headache .
Sustained symptom resolution was defined as absence of any of these symptoms , except for allowance of mild fatigue and cough , in two consecutive assessments .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Phase 2 Data from the Randomized , Open - Label Portion of BLAZE - 4 ( High Risk Subjects ; Treatment Arms 12 - 13 ) In this portion of the trial , subjects were treated with a single infusion of bamlanivimab 700 mg , etesevimab 1 , 400 mg , and bebtelovimab 175 mg ( N = 50 ) or 175 mg bebtelovimab alone ( N = 100 ) .
The majority ( 91 . 3 % ) of the subjects enrolled in these dose arms meet the criteria for high - risk .
At baseline , median age was 50 years ( with 28 subjects aged 65 or older ) ; 52 % of subjects were female , 75 % were White , 18 % were Hispanic or Latino , and 18 % were Black or African American .
Subjects had mild ( 75 % ) to moderate ( 25 % ) COVID - 19 ; the mean duration of symptoms was 4 . 7 days ; mean viral load by cycle threshold ( CT ) was 26 . 66 at baseline ; and 20 . 7 % of subjects had at least one dose of a COVID - 19 vaccine .
There were 2 pediatric patients enrolled ( ages 14 and 17 ) , one in each treatment arm .
The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups .
The primary objective for these treatment arms was to characterize the safety profile of bebtelovimab 175 mg by evaluating adverse events and serious adverse events .
Efficacy endpoints included the proportion of subjects with COVID - 19 related hospitalization or death by any cause by Day 29 , mean change in viral load from baseline to Days 3 , 5 , 7 , and 11 and time to sustained symptom resolution .
The proportion of subjects with COVID - 19 related hospitalization ( defined as ≥ 24 hours of acute care ) or death by any cause was assessed by Day 29 .
Events occurred in 2 ( 4 % ) subjects treated with bamlanivimab 700 mg , etesevimab 1 , 400 mg , and bebtelovimab 175 mg together and 3 ( 3 % ) subjects treated with bebtelovimab 175 mg alone .
There was 1 subject treated with bebtelovimab 175 mg alone who died on Day 34 .
Mean changes in viral load from baseline to Day 3 , 5 , 7 , and 11 are shown in Figure 2 .

The median time to sustained symptom resolution as recorded in a trial specific daily symptom diary was 7 days for subjects treated with bebtelovimab 175 mg alone .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 3 Phase 2 Data from the Non - Randomized , Open - Label Portion of BLAZE - 4 ( High Risk Subjects ; Treatment Arm 14 ) In this portion of the trial , subjects were treated with a single infusion of bamlanivimab 700 mg , etesevimab 1 , 400 mg , and bebtelovimab 175 mg ( N = 176 ) .
The majority ( 97 . 7 % ) of the subjects enrolled meet the criteria for high - risk .
At baseline , median age was 51 years ( with 35 subjects aged 65 or older ) ; 56 % of subjects were female , 80 % were White , 28 % were Hispanic or Latino , and 16 % were Black or African American .
Subjects had mild ( 73 % ) to moderate ( 27 % ) COVID - 19 ; the mean duration of symptoms was 4 days ; mean viral load by cycle threshold ( CT ) was 23 . 45 at baseline ; and 31 % of subjects had at least one dose of a COVID - 19 vaccine .
There were 2 pediatric patients enrolled ( ages 14 and 15 ) .
The primary objective for this treatment arm was to characterize the safety profile of bamlanivimab 700 mg , etesevimab 1 , 400 mg , and bebtelovimab 175 mg by evaluating adverse events and serious adverse events .
Efficacy endpoints included the proportion of subjects with COVID - 19 related hospitalization or death by any cause by Day 29 , mean change in viral load from baseline to Days 3 , 5 , 7 , and 11 , and time to sustained symptom resolution .
The proportion of subjects with COVID - 19 related hospitalization ( defined as ≥ 24 hours of acute care ) or death by any cause was assessed by Day 29 .
Events occurred in 3 subjects ( 1 . 7 % ) , and no subjects died .
Mean changes in viral load from baseline to Day 3 , 5 , 7 , and 11 were - 1 . 4 , - 3 . 1 , - 4 . 0 , and - 5 . 4 , respectively .
The median time to sustained symptom resolution as recorded in a trial specific daily symptom diary was 8 days .

Overall Benefit - Risk Assessment and Limitations of Data Supporting the Benefits of the Product Based on the data from BLAZE - 4 , bebtelovimab has been shown to improve symptoms in patients with mild - to - moderate COVID - 19 .
Additionally , a reduction in SARS - CoV - 2 viral load on Day 5 was observed relative to placebo , though the clinical significance of this is unclear .
The placebo - controlled phase 2 data are limited by enrollment of only subjects without risk factors for progression to severe COVID - 19 , and the trial was not powered or designed to determine a difference in the clinical outcomes of hospitalization or death between the placebo and bebtelovimab treatment arms [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
Bebtelovimab has been studied in individuals who have risk factors for progression to severe COVID - 19 , but the efficacy analyses are limited due to the lack of a concurrent placebo control arm for this population [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 , 14 . 3 ) ] .
However , based on the totality of scientific evidence available , including the available Phase 2 and pharmacokinetic data , along with the nonclinical viral neutralization data for Omicron and other variants of concern , it is reasonable to believe that bebtelovimab may be effective for the treatment of patients with mild - to - moderate COVID - 19 to reduce the risk of progression to hospitalization or death .
In addition , the mechanism of action for bebtelovimab is similar to other neutralizing SARS - CoV - 2 monoclonal antibodies , including bamlanivimab and etesevimab , that have data from Phase 3 clinical trials showing a reduction in hospitalization or death in high risk patients infected with other SARS - CoV - 2 variants .
The safety profile of bebtelovimab is acceptable with monitorable risks and is comparable to other SARS - CoV - 2 monoclonal antibodies , including bamlanivimab and etesevimab .
Considered together , these data support that the known and potential benefits of treatment with bebtelovimab outweigh the known and potential risks in adults and pediatric patients ( 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg ) with positive results of direct SARS - CoV - 2 viral testing and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID - 19 , including hospitalization or death , and for whom alternative COVID - 19 treatment options approved or authorized by FDA are not accessible or clinically appropriate .
Clinical data summarized above were similar for bebtelovimab alone as compared to the combination of bamlanivimab , etesevimab and bebtelovimab administered together .
Bebtelovimab retains activity against currently circulating variants [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .

What is COVID - 19 ?
COVID - 19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) .
You can get COVID - 19 through contact with another person who has the virus .
COVID - 19 illnesses have ranged from very mild ( including some with no reported symptoms ) to severe , including illness resulting in death .
While information so far suggests that most COVID - 19 illness is mild , serious illness can happen and may cause some of your or your child ' s other medical conditions to become worse .
Older people and people of all ages with severe , or long lasting ( chronic ) medical conditions like heart disease , lung disease , diabetes , and obesity , for example , seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID - 19 .
Older age , with or without other conditions , also places people at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID - 19 .

• Ask your healthcare provider • Visit https : / / www . cdc . gov / COVID19 • Contact your local or state public health department What is an Emergency Use Authorization ?
The United States FDA has made bebtelovimab available under an emergency access mechanism called an Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) .
The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service ( HHS ) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID - 19 pandemic .
Bebtelovimab for the treatment of mild - to - moderate COVID - 19 in adults and children ( 12 years of age and older weighing at least 88 pounds [ 40 kg ] ) and who are at high risk of developing severe COVID - 19 , including hospitalization or death , and for whom other COVID - 19 treatment options approved or authorized by FDA are not available or clinically appropriate has not undergone the same type of review as an FDA - approved product .
In issuing an EUA under the COVID - 19 public health emergency , the FDA has determined , among other things , that based on the total amount of scientific evidence available , including data from adequate and well - controlled clinical trials , it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective for diagnosing , treating , or preventing COVID - 19 , or a serious or life - threatening disease or condition caused by COVID - 19 ; that the known and potential benefits of the product , when used to diagnose , treat , or prevent such disease or condition , outweigh the known and potential risks of such product ; and that there are no adequate , approved and available alternatives .
All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used in the treatment of patients during the COVID - 19 pandemic .
The EUA for bebtelovimab is in effect for the duration of the COVID - 19 declaration justifying emergency use of bebtelovimab , unless terminated or revoked ( after which bebtelovimab may no longer be used under the EUA ) .
