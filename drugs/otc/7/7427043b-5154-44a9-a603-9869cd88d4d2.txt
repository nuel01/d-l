• What is the Nicotine Patch and How is it Used ?
• Nicotine Patch is a small , nicotine - containing patch .
When you put on a Nicotine Patch , nicotine passes through the skin and into your body .
Nicotine Patch is very thin and uses special material to control how fast nicotine passes through the skin .
Unlike the sudden jolts of nicotine delivered by cigarettes , the amount of nicotine you receive remains relatively smooth throughout the 24 or 16 - hour period you wear the Nicotine Patch .
This helps to reduce cravings you may have for nicotine .
