6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
UPTRAVI Tablets The safety of UPTRAVI tablets has been evaluated in a long - term , placebo - controlled study enrolling 1 , 156 patients with symptomatic PAH ( GRIPHON study ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The exposure to UPTRAVI in this trial was up to 4 . 2 years with median duration of exposure of 1 . 4 years .
Table 2 presents adverse reactions more frequent on UPTRAVI tablets than on placebo by ≥ 3 % .
Table 2 : Adverse Reactions UPTRAVI Placebo Adverse Reaction N = 575 N = 577 Headache 65 % 32 % Diarrhea 42 % 18 % Jaw pain 26 % 6 % Nausea 33 % 18 % Myalgia 16 % 6 % Vomiting 18 % 9 % Pain in extremity 17 % 8 % Flushing 12 % 5 % Arthralgia 11 % 8 % Anemia 8 % 5 % Decreased appetite 6 % 3 % Rash 11 % 8 % These adverse reactions are more frequent during the dose titration phase .
Hyperthyroidism was observed in 1 % ( n = 8 ) of patients on UPTRAVI tablets and in none of the patients on placebo .
UPTRAVI for Injection Infusion - site reactions ( infusion site erythema / redness , pain and swelling ) were reported with UPTRAVI for Injection .
Laboratory Test Abnormalities Hemoglobin In a Phase 3 placebo - controlled study in patients with PAH , mean absolute changes in hemoglobin at regular visits compared to baseline ranged from − 0 . 34 to − 0 . 02 g / dL in the UPTRAVI group compared to − 0 . 05 to 0 . 25 g / dL in the placebo group .
A decrease in hemoglobin concentration to below 10 g / dL was reported in 8 . 6 % of patients treated with UPTRAVI tablets and 5 . 0 % of placebo - treated patients .
Thyroid Function Tests In a Phase 3 placebo - controlled study in patients with PAH , a reduction ( up to − 0 . 3 MU / L from a baseline median of 2 . 5 MU / L ) in median thyroid - stimulating hormone ( TSH ) was observed at most visits in the UPTRAVI group .
In the placebo group , little change in median values was apparent .
There were no mean changes in triiodothyronine or thyroxine in either group .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of UPTRAVI .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Vascular disorders : symptomatic hypotension 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors ( e . g . , clopidogrel , deferasirox and teriflunomide ) increase exposure to the active metabolite of UPTRAVI .
Reduce the dosing of UPTRAVI to once daily ( 2 . 6 , 7 . 1 , 12 . 3 ) .
• CYP2C8 inducers ( e . g . , rifampin ) decrease exposure to the active metabolite .
Increase up to twice the dose of UPTRAVI ( 7 . 2 , 12 . 3 ) 7 . 1CYP2C8 Inhibitors Concomitant administration with gemfibrozil , a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8 , doubled the exposure to selexipag and increased exposure to the active metabolite by approximately 11 - fold .
Concomitant administration of UPTRAVI with strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 ( e . g . , gemfibrozil ) is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Concomitant administration of UPTRAVI tablets with clopidogrel , a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C8 , had no relevant effect on the exposure to selexipag and increased the exposure to the active metabolite by approximately 2 . 7 - fold [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Reduce the dosing of UPTRAVI to once daily in patients on a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
7 . 2CYP2C8 Inducers Concomitant administration with an inducer of CYP2C8 and UGT 1A3 and 2B7 enzymes ( rifampin ) halved exposure to the active metabolite .
Increase dose up to twice of UPTRAVI when co - administered with rifampin .
Reduce UPTRAVI when rifampin is stopped [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Nursing mothers : Discontinue UPTRAVI or breastfeeding .
( 8 . 2 ) • Severe hepatic impairment : Avoid use .
( 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well - controlled studies with UPTRAVI in pregnant women .
Animal reproduction studies performed with selexipag showed no clinically relevant effects on embryofetal development and survival .
A slight reduction in maternal as well as in fetal body weight was observed when pregnant rats were administered selexipag during organogenesis at a dose producing an exposure to the active metabolite approximately 47 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose .
No adverse developmental outcomes were observed with oral administration of selexipag to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis at exposures to the active metabolite up to 50 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 – 4 % and 15 – 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Pregnant rats were treated with selexipag using oral doses of 2 , 6 , and 20 mg / kg / day ( up to 47 times the exposure to the active metabolite at the maximum recommended human oral dose of 1600 mcg twice daily on an area under the curve [ AUC ] basis ) during the period of organogenesis ( gestation days 7 to 17 ) .
Selexipag did not cause adverse developmental effects to the fetus in this study .
A slight reduction in fetal body weight was observed in parallel with a slight reduction in maternal body weight at the high dose .
Pregnant rabbits were treated with selexipag using oral doses of 3 , 10 , and 30 mg / kg ( up to 50 times the exposure to the active metabolite at the maximum recommended human oral dose of 1600 mcg twice daily on an AUC basis ) during the period of organogenesis ( gestation days 6 to 18 ) .
Selexipag did not cause adverse developmental effects to the fetus in this study .
In a pre - and post - natal development study , pregnant rats were treated with selexipag from gestation day 7 through lactation day 20 at oral doses of 2 , 6 , and 20 mg / kg / day ( up to 35 times the exposure to the active metabolite at the maximum recommended human dose of 1600 mcg twice daily on an AUC basis ) .
Treatment with selexipag did not cause adverse developmental effects in this study at any dose .
8 . 2 Lactation It is not known if UPTRAVI is present in human milk .
Selexipag or its metabolites were present in the milk of rats .
Because many drugs are present in the human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants , discontinue nursing or discontinue UPTRAVI .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 1 , 368 subjects in clinical studies of UPTRAVI tablets , 248 subjects were 65 years of age and older , while 19 were 75 and older .
No overall differences were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity cannot be ruled out .
8 . 6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment No adjustment to the dosing regimen is needed in patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class A ) .
A once - daily regimen is recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class B ) due to the increased exposure to selexipag and its active metabolite .
There is no experience with UPTRAVI in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class C ) .
Avoid use of UPTRAVI in patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Patients with Renal Impairment No adjustment to the dosing regimen is needed in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate > 15 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 .
There is no clinical experience with UPTRAVI in patients undergoing dialysis or in patients with glomerular filtration rates < 15 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Isolated cases of overdose with UPTRAVI tablets up to 3200 mcg were reported .
Mild , transient nausea was the only reported consequence .
In the event of overdose , supportive measures must be taken as required .
Dialysis is unlikely to be effective because selexipag and its active metabolite are highly protein - bound .
11 DESCRIPTION UPTRAVI contains selexipag , a prostacyclin receptor agonist .
The chemical name of selexipag is 2 - { 4 - [ ( 5 , 6 - diphenylpyrazin - 2 - yl ) ( isopropyl ) amino ] butoxy } - N - ( methylsulfonyl ) acetamide .
It has a molecular formula of C26H32N4O4S and a molecular weight of 496 . 62 .
Selexipag has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Selexipag is a pale yellow crystalline powder that is practically insoluble in water .
In the solid state selexipag is very stable , is not hygroscopic , and is not light sensitive .
UPTRAVI ® ( selexipag ) tablets : depending on the dose strength , each round film - coated tablet for oral administration contains 200 , 400 , 600 , 800 , 1000 , 1200 , 1400 , or 1600 mcg of selexipag .
The tablets include the following inactive ingredients : corn starch , D - mannitol , hydroxypropyl cellulose , low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose , and magnesium stearate .
The tablets are film coated with a coating material containing carnauba wax , hypromellose , propylene glycol , titanium dioxide , along with mixtures of iron oxide black , iron oxide red or iron oxide yellow .
UPTRAVI ® ( selexipag ) for injection : contains 1800 mcg of selexipag per vial .
UPTRAVI for injection includes the following inactive ingredients : glycine ( 180 mg ) , phosphoric acid ( 3 . 53 mg ) , polysorbate 20 ( 10 . 8 mg ) and sodium hydroxide ( for pH adjustment ) .
UPTRAVI for injection is provided in 10 mL Type I clear glass vials closed by a stopper and tear - off aluminum seal .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Selexipag is a prostacyclin receptor ( IP receptor ) agonist that is structurally distinct from prostacyclin .
Selexipag is hydrolyzed by carboxylesterase 1 to yield its active metabolite , which is approximately 37 - fold as potent as selexipag .
Selexipag and the active metabolite are selective for the IP receptor versus other prostanoid receptors ( EP1 – 4 , DP , FP , and TP ) .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology At the maximum tolerated dose of 1600 mcg UPTRAVI tablets twice daily , UPTRAVI does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent .
Platelet Aggregation Both selexipag and its active metabolite caused concentration - dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation in vitro with an IC50 of 5 . 5 µM and 0 . 21 µM , respectively .
However , at clinically relevant concentrations , there was no effect on platelet aggregation test parameters as seen following multiple - dose administrations of UPTRAVI tablets in healthy subjects from 400 to 1800 mcg twice daily .
Pulmonary Hemodynamics A Phase 2 clinical study assessed hemodynamic variables after 17 weeks of oral treatment in patients with PAH WHO Functional Class II – III and concomitantly receiving endothelin receptor antagonists ( ERAs ) and / or phosphodiesterase type 5 ( PDE - 5 ) inhibitors .
Patients titrating UPTRAVI tablets to an individually tolerated dose ( 200 mcg twice daily increments up to 800 mcg twice daily ) ( N = 33 ) achieved a statistically - significant mean reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance of 30 . 3 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] − 44 . 7 % , − 12 . 2 % ) and an increase in cardiac index ( median treatment effect ) of 0 . 41 L / min / m2 ( 95 % CI 0 . 10 , 0 . 71 ) compared to placebo ( N = 10 ) .
Drug Interaction In a study in healthy subjects , UPTRAVI tablets ( 400 mcg twice a day ) did not influence the pharmacodynamic effect of warfarin on the international normalized ratio .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of selexipag and its active metabolite have been studied primarily in healthy subjects .
The pharmacokinetics of selexipag and the active metabolite , after both single - and multiple - dose oral administration , were dose - proportional up to a single dose of 800 mcg and multiple doses of up to 1800 mcg twice daily .
The pharmacokinetics of selexipag and the active metabolite , after multiple - dose intravenous administration , were dose - proportional in the tested dose range from 450 to 1800 mcg twice a day .
In healthy subjects , inter - subject variability in exposure ( area under the curve over a dosing interval , AUC ) at steady - state following oral administration was 43 % and 39 % for selexipag and the active metabolite , respectively .
Intra - subject variability in exposure was 24 % and 19 % for selexipag and the active metabolite , respectively .
Exposures to selexipag and the active metabolite at steady - state in PAH patients and healthy subjects were similar .
The pharmacokinetics of selexipag and the active metabolite in PAH patients were not influenced by the severity of the disease and did not change with time .
The corresponding UPTRAVI tablets and UPTRAVI for injection doses ( Table 1 ) provide similar exposure to the active metabolite in PAH patients at steady - state , whereas the exposure to selexipag is approximately twice as high after intravenous administration compared to oral administration .
Both in healthy subjects and PAH patients , after oral administration , exposure at steady - state to the active metabolite is approximately 3 - to 4 - fold that of selexipag .
Absorption The absolute bioavailability of orally administered selexipag is approximately 49 % .
Upon oral administration , maximum observed plasma concentrations of selexipag and its active metabolite are reached within about 1 – 3 hours and 3 – 4 hours , respectively .
In the presence of food , the absorption of selexipag was prolonged resulting in a delayed time to peak concentration ( Tmax ) and ~ 30 % lower peak plasma concentration ( Cmax ) .
The exposure to selexipag and the active metabolite ( AUC ) did not significantly change in the presence of food .
Distribution The volume of distribution of selexipag at steady - state is 11 . 7 L . Selexipag and its active metabolite are highly bound to plasma proteins ( approximately 99 % in total and to the same extent to albumin and alpha1 - acid glycoprotein ) .
Metabolism Selexipag is hydrolyzed to its active metabolite , ( free carboxylic acid ) in the liver and intestine by carboxylesterases .
Oxidative metabolism , catalyzed mainly by CYP2C8 and to a smaller extent by CYP3A4 , leads to the formation of hydroxylated and dealkylated products .
UGT1A3 and UGT2B7 are involved in the glucuronidation of the active metabolite .
Except for the active metabolite , none of the circulating metabolites in human plasma exceeds 3 % of the total drug - related material .
Elimination Elimination of selexipag is predominately via metabolism with a mean terminal half - life of 0 . 8 – 2 . 5 hours .
The terminal half - life of the active metabolite is 6 . 2 – 13 . 5 hours .
Selexipag does not accumulate following twice daily repeat administration .
There is minimal accumulation of the active metabolite upon twice daily repeat administration suggesting that the effective half - life is in the range of 3 – 4 hours .
The total body clearance of selexipag is 17 . 9 L / hour .
Excretion In a study in healthy subjects with radiolabeled selexipag , approximately 93 % of radioactive drug material was eliminated in feces and only 12 % in urine .
Neither selexipag nor its active metabolite were found in urine .
Specific Populations No clinically relevant effects of sex , race , age or body weight on the pharmacokinetics of selexipag and its active metabolite have been observed in healthy subjects or PAH patients .
Age The pharmacokinetic variables ( Cmax and AUC ) were similar in adult and elderly subjects up to 75 years of age .
There was no effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of selexipag and the active metabolite in PAH patients .
Hepatic Impairment In subjects with mild ( Child - Pugh class A ) or moderate ( Child - Pugh class B ) hepatic impairment , exposure to selexipag was 2 - and 4 - fold that seen in healthy subjects .
Exposure to the active metabolite of selexipag remained almost unchanged in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and was doubled in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Based on pharmacokinetic modeling of data from a study in subjects with hepatic impairment , the exposure to the active metabolite at steady - state in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class B ) after a once daily regimen is expected to be similar to that in healthy subjects receiving a twice daily regimen .
The exposure to selexipag at steady - state in these patients during a once daily regimen is predicted to be approximately 2 - fold that seen in healthy subjects receiving a twice - daily regimen .
Renal Impairment A 40 – 70 % increase in exposure ( maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration - time curve ) to selexipag and its active metabolite was observed in subjects with severe renal impairment ( estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 15 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 and < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Drug Interaction Studies Drug interaction studies have been performed in adult subjects using UPTRAVI tablets .
In Vitro Studies Selexipag is hydrolyzed to its active metabolite by carboxylesterases .
Selexipag and its active metabolite both undergo oxidative metabolism mainly by CYP2C8 and to a smaller extent by CYP3A4 .
The glucuronidation of the active metabolite is catalyzed by UGT1A3 and UGT2B7 .
Selexipag and its active metabolite are substrates of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 .
Selexipag is a substrate of P - gp , and the active metabolite is a substrate of the transporter of breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) .
Selexipag and its active metabolite do not inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes and transport proteins at clinically relevant concentrations .
The results of in vivo drug interaction studies are presented in Figure 1 and 2 .

Figure 2 Effect of UPTRAVI on Other Drugs [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis : In the 2 - year carcinogenicity studies , chronic oral administration of selexipag revealed no evidence of carcinogenic potential in rats at 100 mg / kg / day and mice at 500 mg / kg / day which resulted in the exposures to the active metabolite more than 25 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended human oral dose of 1600 mcg twice daily on an AUC basis .
Mutagenesis : Selexipag and the active metabolite are not genotoxic on the basis of the overall evidence of conducted genotoxicity studies .
Fertility : In rats administered with selexipag orally , the no effect dose for effects on fertility was 60 mg / kg / day which resulted in the exposure to the active metabolite approximately 175 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended human oral dose of 1600 mcg twice daily on an AUC basis .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Efficacy of UPTRAVI Tablets in Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension The effect of UPTRAVI tablets on progression of PAH was demonstrated in a multi - center , double - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel group , event - driven study ( GRIPHON ) in 1 , 156 patients with symptomatic ( WHO Functional Class I [ 0 . 8 % ] , II [ 46 % ] , III [ 53 % ] , and IV [ 1 % ] ) PAH .
Patients were randomized to either placebo ( N = 582 ) , or UPTRAVI tablets ( N = 574 ) .
The dose was increased in weekly intervals by increments of 200 mcg twice a day to the highest tolerated dose up to 1600 mcg twice a day .
The primary study endpoint was the time to first occurrence up to end - of - treatment of : a ) death , b ) hospitalization for PAH , c ) PAH worsening resulting in need for lung transplantation , or balloon atrial septostomy , d ) initiation of parenteral prostanoid therapy or chronic oxygen therapy , or e ) other disease progression based on a 15 % decrease from baseline in 6 MWD plus worsening of Functional Class or need for additional PAH - specific therapy .
The mean age was 48 years , the majority of patients were white ( 65 % ) and female ( 80 % ) .
Nearly all patients were in WHO Functional Class II and III at baseline .
Idiopathic or heritable PAH was the most common etiology in the study population ( 58 % ) followed by PAH associated with connective tissue disease ( 29 % ) , PAH associated with congenital heart disease with repaired shunts ( 10 % ) , drugs and toxins ( 2 % ) , and HIV ( 1 % ) .
At baseline , the majority of enrolled patients ( 80 % ) were being treated with a stable dose of an endothelin receptor antagonist ( 15 % ) , a PDE - 5 inhibitor ( 32 % ) , or both ( 33 % ) .
Patients on UPTRAVI tablets achieved doses within the following groups : 200 – 400 mcg ( 23 % ) , 600 – 1000 mcg ( 31 % ) and 1200 – 1600 mcg ( 43 % ) .
Treatment with UPTRAVI tablets resulted in a 40 % reduction ( 99 % CI : 22 to 54 % ; two - sided log - rank p - value < 0 . 0001 ) of the occurrence of primary endpoint events compared to placebo ( Table 3 ; Figure 3 ) .
The beneficial effect of UPTRAVI was primarily attributable to a reduction in hospitalization for PAH and a reduction in other disease progression events ( Table 3 ) .
The observed benefit of UPTRAVI was similar regardless of the dose achieved when patients were titrated to their highest tolerated dose [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .

Figures 4 A , B , and C show time to first event analyses for primary endpoint components of hospitalization for PAH ( A ) , other disease progression ( B ) , and death ( C ) all censored 7 days after any primary end point event ( because many patients on placebo transitioned to open - label UPTRAVI at this point ) .
Figure 4 A Hospitalization for PAH as the First Endpoint in GRIPHON [ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 4 B Disease Progression as the First Endpoint in GRIPHON [ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 4 C Death as the First Endpoint in GRIPHON [ MULTIMEDIA ] The treatment effect of UPTRAVI on time to first primary event was consistent irrespective of background PAH therapy ( i . e . , in combination with an ERA , PDE - 5 i , both , or without background therapy ) ( Figure 5 ) .
Figure 5 Subgroup Analyses of the Primary Endpoint in GRIPHON [ MULTIMEDIA ] Note : Race group " Other " is not displayed in analysis , as the population is less than 30 .
EU = Number of UPTRAVI patients with events , NU = Number of patients randomized to UPTRAVI , EP = Number of Placebo patients with events , NP = Number of patients randomized to Placebo , HR = Hazard Ratio , CI = Confidence Interval , the size of the squares represent the number of patients in the subgroup .
Note : The figure above presents effects in various subgroups all of which are baseline characteristics and all were pre - specified .
The 99 % confidence limits that are shown do not take into account how many comparisons were made , nor do they reflect the effect of a particular factor after adjustment for all other factors .
Apparent homogeneity or heterogeneity among groups should not be over - interpreted .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 6 - Minute Walk Distance ( 6 MWD ) Exercise capacity was evaluated as a secondary endpoint .
Median absolute change from baseline to week 26 in 6 MWD measured at trough ( i . e . , at approximately 12 hours post - dose ) was + 4 meters with UPTRAVI and - 9 meters in the placebo group .
This resulted in a placebo - corrected median treatment effect of 12 meters ( 99 % CI : 1 , 24 meters ; two - sided p = 0 . 005 ) .
Long - Term Treatment of PAH In long - term follow - up of patients who were treated with UPTRAVI in the pivotal study and the open - label extension ( N = 574 ) , Kaplan - Meier estimates of survival of these patients across the GRIPHON study and the long - term extension study at 1 , 2 , 5 and 7 years were 92 % , 85 % , 71 % , and 63 % , respectively .
The median exposure to UPTRAVI was 3 years .
These uncontrolled observations do not allow comparison with a control group not given UPTRAVI and cannot be used to determine the long - term effect of UPTRAVI on mortality .
