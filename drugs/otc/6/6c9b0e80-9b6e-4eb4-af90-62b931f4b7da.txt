Size ( mL ) Sodium Chloride ( NaCl ) Potassium Chloride ( KCl ) Sodium ( Na + ) Potassium ( K + ) Chloride ( Cl - ) 0409 - 9257 - 39 1000 4 . 5 1 . 49 194 4 . 8 ( 3 . 5 to 6 . 5 ) 77 20 97 0990 - 9257 - 39 1000 4 . 5 1 . 49 194 4 . 8 ( 3 . 5 to 6 . 5 ) 77 20 97 The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinyl chloride ( PL 146 Plastic ) .
The amount of water that can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period .
However , the safety of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection , USP has value as a source of water and electrolytes .
It is capable of inducing diuresis depending on the clinical condition of the patient .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection , USP is indicated as a source of water and electrolytes .
CONTRAINDICATIONS None known .
WARNINGS Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection , USP should be used with great care , if at all , in patients with congestive heart failure , severe renal insufficiency and in clinical states in which there exists edema with sodium retention .
Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection , USP should be used with great care , if at all , in patients with hyperkalemia , severe renal failure and in conditions in which potassium retention is present .
The intravenous administration of Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection , USP can cause fluid and / or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the injection .
The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the injection .
In patients with diminished renal function , administration of Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection , USP may result in sodium or potassium retention .
Potassium salts should never be administered by IV push .
PRECAUTIONS Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance , electrolyte concentrations and acid base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation .
Caution must be exercised in the administration of Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection , USP to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C : Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection , USP .
It is also not known whether Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection , USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection , USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Carcinogenesis , mutagenesis , impairment of fertility Studies with Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection , USP have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , mutagenic potential or effects on fertility .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection , USP is administered to a nursing mother .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection , USP in pediatric patients have not been established by adequate and well - controlled studies .
However , the use of potassium chloride injection in pediatric patients to treat potassium deficiency states when oral replacement therapy is not feasible is referenced in the medical literature .
For patients receiving potassium supplement at greater than maintenance rates , frequent monitoring of serum potassium levels and serial EKGs are recommended .
Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection , USP did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
Do not administer unless solution is clear and seal is intact .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response , infection at the site of injection , venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection , extravasation and hypervolemia .
If an adverse reaction does occur , discontinue the infusion , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
Dosage and Administration As directed by a physician .
Dosage is dependent upon the age , weight and clinical condition of the patient as well as laboratory determinations .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit .
Use of final filter is recommended during administration of all parenteral solutions , where possible .
Potassium Chloride in Sodium Chloride Injection , USP in flexible plastic containers is intended for intravenous administration .
Additives may be incompatible .
Complete information is not available .
Those additives known to be incompatible should not be used .
Consult with pharmacist , if available .
If , in the informed judgment of the physician , it is deemed advisable to introduce additives , use aseptic technique .
Mix thoroughly when additives have been introduced .
Do not store solutions containing additives .
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE To Open Tear outer wrap at notch and remove solution container .
If supplemental medication is desired , follow directions below before preparing for administration .
Some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed .
This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety .
The opacity will diminish gradually .
To Add Medication • Prepare additive port .
• Using aseptic technique and an additive delivery needle of appropriate length , puncture resealable additive port at target area , inner diaphragm and inject .
Withdraw needle after injecting medication .
• The additive port may be protected by covering with an additive cap .
• Mix container contents thoroughly .
Preparation for Administration ( Use aseptic technique ) • Close flow control clamp of administration set .
• Remove cover from outlet port at bottom of container .
• Insert piercing pin of administration set into port with a twisting motion until the set is firmly seated .
