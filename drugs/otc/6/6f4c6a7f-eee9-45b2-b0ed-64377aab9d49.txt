6 . 2 Post Marketing Experience The following adverse reaction has been identified during post approval use of topical metronidazole : peripheral neuropathy .
Because this reaction is reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Oral metronidazole has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of coumarin and warfarin , resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time .
Drug interactions should be kept in mind when metronidazole is prescribed for patients who are receiving anticoagulant treatment , although they are less likely to occur with topical metronidazole administration because of low absorption .

( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category B .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies with the use of metronidazole in pregnant women .
Metronidazole crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation rapidly .
No fetotoxicity was observed after oral administration of metronidazole in rats or mice at 200 and 20 times , respectively , the expected clinical dose .
However , oral metronidazole has shown carcinogenic activity in rodents .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , metronidazole should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers After oral administration , metronidazole is secreted in breast milk in concentrations similar to those found in the plasma .
Even though blood levels taken after topical metronidazole application are significantly lower than those achieved after oral metronidazole a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother and the risk to the infant .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Sixty - six subjects aged 65 years and older were treated with metronidazole gel USP , 1 % in the clinical study .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
10 OVERDOSAGE There are no reported human experiences with overdosage of metronidazole .
Topically applied metronidazole can be absorbed in sufficient amount to produce systemic effects .
11 DESCRIPTION Metronidazole Gel USP , 1 % contains metronidazole , USP .
Chemically , metronidazole is 2 - methyl - 5 - nitro - 1 H - imidazole - 1 - ethanol .

It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Metronidazole has a molecular weight of 171 . 16 .
It is a white to pale yellow crystalline powder .
It is slightly soluble in alcohol and has solubility in water of 10 mg / mL at 20 ° C . Metronidazole belongs to the nitroimidazole class of compounds .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metronidazole in the treatment of rosacea is unknown .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of metronidazole in association with the treatment of rosacea are unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Topical administration of a one gram dose of metronidazole to the face of 13 patients with moderate to severe rosacea once daily for 7 days resulted in a mean ± SD Cmax of metronidazole of 32 ± 9 ng / mL .
The mean ± SD AUC ( 0 - 24 ) was 595 ± 154 ng * hr / mL .
The mean Cmax and AUC ( 0 - 24 ) are less than 1 % of the value reported for a single 250 mg oral dose of metronidazole .
The time to maximum plasma concentration ( Tmax ) was 6 to 10 hours after topical application .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Metronidazole has shown evidence of carcinogenic activity in a number of studies involving chronic , oral administration in mice and rats , but not in studies involving hamsters .
In several long - term studies in mice , oral doses of approximately 225 mg / m2 / day or greater ( approximately 37 times the human topical dose on a mg / m2 basis ) were associated with an increase in pulmonary tumors and lymphomas .
Several long - term oral studies in the rat have shown statistically significant increases in mammary and hepatic tumors at doses > 885 mg / m2 / day ( 144 times the human dose ) .
Metronidazole has shown evidence of mutagenic activity in several in vitro bacterial assay systems .
In addition , a dose - related increase in the frequency of micronuclei was observed in mice after intraperitoneal injections .
An increase in chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes was reported in patients with Crohn ' s disease who were treated with 200 to 1200 mg / day of metronidazole for 1 to 24 months .
However , in another study , no increase in chromosomal aberrations in circulating lymphocytes was observed in patients with Crohn ' s disease treated with the drug for 8 months .
In one published study , using albino hairless mice , intraperitoneal administration of metronidazole at a dose of 45 mg / m2 / day ( approximately 7 times the human topical dose on a mg / m2 basis ) was associated with an increase in ultraviolet radiation induced skin carcinogenesis .
Neither dermal carcinogenicity nor photocarcinogenicity studies have been performed with metronidazole gel USP , 1 % or any marketed metronidazole formulations .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES In a randomized , vehicle - controlled trial , 746 subjects with rosacea were treated with metronidazole gel USP , 1 % or gel vehicle once daily for 10 weeks .
Most subjects had " moderate " rosacea at baseline .
Efficacy was determined by recording reduction in inflammatory lesion counts and success rate in the Investigator Global Assessment ( percentage of subjects " clear " and " almost clear " of rosacea at the end of the study ) .
The scale is based on the following definitions : Table 3 : Investigator Global Assessment ScaleScore Grade Definition 0 Clear No signs or symptoms present ; at most , mild erythema 1 Almost Clear Very mild erythema present .
Very few small papules / pustules 2 Mild Mild erythema .
Several small papules / pustules 3 Moderate Moderate erythema .
Several small or large papules / pustules , and up to 2 nodules 4 Severe Severe erythema .
Numerous small and / or large papules / pustules , up to several nodules The results are shown in the following table : Table 4 : Inflammatory Lesion Counts and Global Scores in a Clinical Trial of Rosacea Metronidazole Gel USP , 1 % Vehicle N Results N ( % ) N Results N ( % ) Inflammatory lesions 557 189 Baseline , mean count 18 . 3 18 . 4 Week - 10 , mean count 8 . 9 12 . 8 Reduction 9 . 4 ( 50 . 7 ) 5 . 6 ( 32 . 6 ) Investigator Global Assessment 557 189 Subject clear or almost clear 214 ( 38 . 42 ) 52 ( 27 . 51 ) Subject with no change 159 ( 28 . 5 ) 77 ( 40 . 7 ) Subjects treated with metronidazole gel USP , 1 % experienced a mean reduction of 9 . 4 inflammatory lesions in the Week - 10 LOCF group , compared to a reduction of 5 . 6 for those treated with vehicle , or a difference in means of 3 . 8 lesions .
The contribution to efficacy of individual components of the vehicle has not been established .
