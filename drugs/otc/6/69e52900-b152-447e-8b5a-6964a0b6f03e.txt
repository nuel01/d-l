Perindopril erbumine may be used alone or given with other classes of antihypertensives , especially thiazide diuretics .
1 . 2 Stable Coronary Artery Disease Perindopril erbumine is indicated for treatment of patients with stable coronary artery disease to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction .
Perindopril erbumine can be used with conventional treatment for management of coronary artery disease , such as antiplatelet , antihypertensive or lipid - lowering therapy .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Hypertension • • The recommended initial dose is 4 mg once a day .
The dosage may be titrated upward until blood pressure , when measured just before the next dose , is controlled or to a maximum of 16 mg per day .
( 2 . 1 ) Stable Coronary Artery Disease • • Perindopril should be given at an initial dose of 4 mg once daily for 2 weeks , and then increased , as tolerated , to a maintenance dose of 8 mg once daily .
( 2 . 2 ) 2 . 1 Hypertension Use in Uncomplicated Hypertensive Patients In patients with essential hypertension , the recommended initial dose is 4 mg once a day .
The dose may be titrated , as needed to a maximum of 16 mg per day .
The usual maintenance dose range is 4 mg to 8 mg administered as a single daily dose or in two divided doses .
Use in Elderly Patients The recommended initial daily dosage of perindopril for the elderly is 4 mg daily , given in one or two divided doses .
Experience with perindopril is limited in the elderly at doses exceeding 8 mg .
Dosages above 8 mg should be administered with careful blood pressure monitoring and dose titration [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Use with Diuretics In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic , symptomatic hypotension can occur following the initial dose of perindopril .
Consider reducing the dose of diuretic prior to starting perindopril erbumine tablets [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 2 Stable Coronary Artery Disease In patients with stable coronary artery disease , perindopril should be given at an initial dose of 4 mg once daily for 2 weeks , and then increased as tolerated , to a maintenance dose of 8 mg once daily .
In elderly patients ( greater than 70 years ) , perindopril should be given as a 2 mg dose once daily in the first week , followed by 4 mg once daily in the second week and 8 mg once daily for maintenance dose if tolerated .
2 . 3 Dose Adjustment in Renal Impairment and Dialysis Perindoprilat elimination is decreased in renally impaired patients .
Perindopril is not recommended in patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min .
For patients with lesser degrees of impairment , the initial dosage should be 2 mg / day and dosage should not exceed 8 mg / day .
During dialysis , perindopril is removed with the same clearance as in patients with normal renal function .

Do not co - administer aliskiren with perindopril erbumine in patients with diabetes [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 8 ) ] .
Perindopril erbumine is contraindicated in combination with neprilysin inhibitor ( e . g . , sacubitril ) .
Do not administer perindopril erbumine within 36 hours of switching to or from sacubitril / valsartan , a neprilysin inhibitor [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
• • Angioedema related to previous treatment with an ACE inhibitor , or a history of hereditary or idiopathic angioedema .
( 4 , 5 . 1 ) • • Do not co - administer aliskiren with perindopril in patients with diabetes .
( 4 , 7 . 8 ) • • Do not take a neprilysin inhibitor with perindopril .
( 4 ) • • Do not administer perindopril within 36 hours of switching to or from sacubitril / valsartan .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Watch for anaphylactoid reactions , including angioedema .
( 5 . 1 ) • • Monitor renal function during therapy .
( 5 . 8 ) • • Assess for hypotension and hyperkalemia .
( 5 . 2 , 5 . 6 ) 5 . 1 Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides , including endogenous bradykinin , patients receiving ACE inhibitors ( including perindopril ) may be subject to a variety of adverse events , some of them serious .
Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to nonblacks .
Head and Neck Angioedema Angioedema of the face , extremities , lips , tongue , glottis , or larynx has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors , including perindopril ( 0 . 1 % of patients treated with perindopril in U . S . clinical trials ) .
Angioedema associated with involvement of the tongue , glottis or larynx may be fatal .
In such cases , discontinue perindopril treatment immediately and observe until the swelling disappears .
When involvement of the tongue , glottis , or larynx appears likely to cause airway obstruction , administer appropriate therapy , such as subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1 : 1000 ( 0 . 3 to 0 . 5 mL ) , promptly .
Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor ( e . g . , temsirolimus ) therapy or a neprilysin inhibitor may be at increased risk for angioedema [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 9 , 7 . 10 ) ] .
Intestinal Angioedema Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors .
These patients presented with abdominal pain ( with or without nausea or vomiting ) ; in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C - 1 esterase levels were normal .
The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound , or at surgery , and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor .
Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain .
5 . 2 Hypotension Perindopril can cause symptomatic hypotension .
Perindopril has been associated with hypotension in 0 . 3 % of uncomplicated hypertensive patients in U . S . placebo - controlled trials .
Symptoms related to orthostatic hypotension were reported in another 0 . 8 % of patients .
Symptomatic hypotension is most likely to occur in patients who have been volume or salt - depleted as a result of prolonged diuretic therapy , dietary salt restriction , dialysis , diarrhea or vomiting [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
ACE inhibitors may cause excessive hypotension , and may be associated with oliguria or azotemia , and rarely with acute renal failure and death .
In patients with ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease , an excessive fall in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or a cerebrovascular accident .
In patients at risk of excessive hypotension , perindopril therapy should be started under very close medical supervision .
Patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of perindopril and / or diuretic is increased .
If excessive hypotension occurs , the patient should be placed immediately in a supine position and , if necessary , treated with an intravenous infusion of physiological saline .
Perindopril treatment can usually be continued following restoration of volume and blood pressure .
5 . 3 Neutropenia / Agranulocytosis ACE inhibitors have been associated with agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression , most frequently in patients with renal impairment , especially patients with a collagen vascular disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus or scleroderma .
5 . 4 Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin - angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death .
Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations .
Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia , anuria , hypotension , renal failure , and death .
When pregnancy is detected discontinue perindopril as soon as possible [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 5 Impaired Renal Function As a consequence of inhibiting the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system , changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals .
Renal function should be monitored periodically in patients receiving perindopril [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
In patients with severe congestive heart failure , where renal function may depend on the activity of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system , treatment with ACE inhibitors , including perindopril , may be associated with oliguria , progressive azotemia , and , rarely , acute renal failure and death .
In hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis , increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur ; usually reversible upon discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor .
In such patients , renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy .
Some perindopril - treated patients have developed minor and transient increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine especially in those concomitantly treated with a diuretic .
5 . 6 Hyperkalemia Elevations of serum potassium have been observed in some patients treated with ACE inhibitors , including perindopril .
Most cases were isolated single values that did not appear clinically relevant and were rarely a cause for withdrawal .
Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency , diabetes mellitus and the concomitant use of agents such as potassium - sparing diuretics , potassium supplements and / or potassium - containing salt substitutes [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Serum potassium should be monitored periodically in patients receiving perindopril .
5 . 7 Cough Presumably because of the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin , persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors , generally resolving after discontinuation of therapy .
Consider ACE inhibitor - induced cough in the differential diagnosis of cough .
5 . 8 Hepatic Failure Rarely , ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and sometimes death .
The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood .
Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow - up .
5 . 9 Surgery / Anesthesia In patients undergoing surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension , perindopril may block angiotensin II formation that would otherwise occur secondary to compensatory renin release .
Hypotension attributable to this mechanism can be corrected by volume expansion .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
• • Hypertension : Most common adverse events ( incidence greater than or equal to 5 % ) are cough , dizziness and back pain .
( 6 . 1 ) • • Stable Coronary Artery Disease : Most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were cough , drug intolerance , and hypotension .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in labeling : • • Anaphylactoid reactions , including angioedema [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Hypotension [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • • Neutropenia and agranulocytosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • • Impaired renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • • Hyperkalemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • • Cough [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] Hypertension Perindopril has been evaluated for safety in approximately 3 , 400 patients with hypertension in U . S . and foreign clinical trials .
The data presented here are based on results from the 1 , 417 perindopril - treated patients who participated in the U . S . clinical trials .
Over 220 of these patients were treated with perindopril for at least one year .
In placebo - controlled U . S . clinical trials , the incidence of premature discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events was 6 . 5 % in patients treated with perindopril and 6 . 7 % in patients treated with placebo .
The most common causes were cough , headache , asthenia and dizziness .
Among 1 , 012 patients in placebo - controlled U . S . trials , the overall frequency of reported adverse events was similar in patients treated with perindopril and in those treated with placebo ( approximately 75 % in each group ) .
The only adverse events whose incidence on perindopril was at least 2 % greater than on placebo were cough ( 12 % vs . 4 . 5 % ) and back pain ( 5 . 8 % vs . 3 . 1 % ) .
Dizziness was not reported more frequently in the perindopril group ( 8 . 2 % ) than in the placebo group ( 8 . 5 % ) , but its likelihood increased with dose , suggesting a causal relationship with perindopril .
Stable Coronary Artery Disease Perindopril has been evaluated for safety in EUROPA , a double - blind , placebo - controlled study in 12 , 218 patients with stable coronary artery disease .
The overall rate of discontinuation was about 22 % on drug and placebo .
The most common medical reasons for discontinuation that were more frequent on perindopril than placebo were cough , drug intolerance and hypotension .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Voluntary reports of adverse events in patients taking perindopril that have been received since market introduction and are of unknown causal relationship to perindopril include : cardiac arrest , eosinophilic pneumonitis , neutropenia / agranulocytosis , pancytopenia , anemia ( including hemolytic and aplastic ) , thrombocytopenia , acute renal failure , nephritis , hepatic failure , jaundice ( hepatocellular or cholestatic ) , symptomatic hyponatremia , bullous pemphigoid , pemphigus , acute pancreatitis , falls , psoriasis , exfoliative dermatitis and a syndrome which may include : arthralgia / arthritis , vasculitis , serositis , myalgia , fever , rash or other dermatologic manifestations , a positive antinuclear antibody ( ANA ) , leukocytosis , eosinophilia or an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) .
6 . 3 Clinical Laboratory Test Findings Hematology Small decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit occur frequently in hypertensive patients treated with perindopril , but are rarely of clinical importance .
In controlled clinical trials , no patient was discontinued from therapy due to the development of anemia .
Leukopenia ( including neutropenia ) was observed in 0 . 1 % of patients in U . S . clinical trials [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Liver Function Tests Elevations in ALT ( 1 . 6 % perindopril versus 0 . 9 % placebo ) and AST ( 0 . 5 % perindopril versus 0 . 4 % placebo ) have been observed in placebo - controlled clinical trials .
The elevations were generally mild and transient and resolved after discontinuation of therapy .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • • Diuretics : Excessive drop in blood pressure .
( 7 . 1 ) • • Potassium - sparing Diuretics / Potassium Supplements : Hyperkalemia .
( 7 . 2 ) • • Lithium : Increase serum lithium levels , symptoms of lithium toxicity .
( 7 . 3 ) • • Injectable Gold : Nitritoid reactions ( facial flushing , nausea , vomiting , and hypotension ) .
( 7 . 4 ) • • NSAID use may lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect .
( 7 . 7 ) • • Dual Inhibition of the Renin - angiotensin System : Increased risk of renal impairment , hypotension , and hyperkalemia .
( 7 . 8 ) • • Neprilysin Inhibitor : Risk of angioedema .
( 7 ) 7 . 1 Diuretics Patients on diuretics , and especially those started recently , may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of perindopril therapy .
The possibility of hypotensive effects can be minimized by either decreasing the dose of or discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with perindopril .
If diuretic therapy cannot be altered , provide close medical supervision with the first dose of perindopril , for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for another hour [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
The rate and extent of perindopril absorption and elimination are not affected by concomitant diuretics .
The bioavailability of perindoprilat was reduced by diuretics , however , and this was associated with a decrease in plasma ACE inhibition .
7 . 2 Potassium Supplements and Potassium - Sparing Diuretics Perindopril may increase serum potassium because of its potential to decrease aldosterone production .
Use of potassium - sparing diuretics ( spironolactone , amiloride , triamterene and others ) , potassium supplements or other drugs capable of increasing serum potassium ( indomethacin , heparin , cyclosporine and others ) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia .
Therefore , if concomitant use of such agents is indicated , monitor the patient ’ s serum potassium frequently .
7 . 3 Lithium Increased serum lithium and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy .
Frequent monitoring of serum lithium concentration is recommended .
Use of a diuretic may further increase the risk of lithium toxicity .
7 . 4 Gold Nitritoid reactions ( symptoms include facial flushing , nausea , vomiting and hypotension ) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold ( sodium aurothiomalate ) and concomitant ACE Inhibitor therapy including perindopril .
7 . 5 Digoxin A controlled pharmacokinetic study has shown no effect on plasma digoxin concentrations when co - administered with perindopril erbumine , but an effect of digoxin on the plasma concentration of perindopril / perindoprilat has not been excluded .
7 . 6 Gentamicin Animal data have suggested the possibility of interaction between perindopril and gentamicin .
However , this has not been investigated in human studies .
7 . 7 Non - Steroidal Anti - Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase - 2 Inhibitors ( COX - 2 Inhibitors ) In patients who are elderly , volume - depleted ( including those on diuretic therapy ) , or with compromised renal function , co - administration of NSAIDs , including selective COX - 2 inhibitors , with ACE inhibitors , including perindopril , may result in deterioration of renal function , including possible acute renal failure .
These effects are usually reversible .
Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving perindopril and NSAID therapy .
The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors , including perindopril , may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX - 2 inhibitors .
7 . 8 Dual Blockade of the Renin - Angiotensin System ( RAS ) Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers , ACE inhibitors , or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension , hyperkalemia , and changes in renal function ( including acute renal failure ) compared to monotherapy .
Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy .
In general , avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors .
Closely monitor blood pressure , renal function and electrolytes in patients on perindopril and other agents that affect the RAS .
Do not co - administer aliskiren with perindopril in patients with diabetes .
Avoid use of aliskiren with perindopril in patients with renal impairment ( GFR < 60 ml / min ) .
7 . 9 mTOR Inhibitors Patients taking concomitant mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
7 . 10 Neprilysin Inhibitor Patients taking concomitant neprilysin inhibitors may be at increased risk for angioedema [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Geriatrics : Start at low daily dose ( 4 mg or less ) and titrate slowly as needed .
Experience with doses exceeding 8 mg is limited .
( 8 . 5 ) • • Dosage adjustment may be necessary in renally impaired patients .
( 8 . 7 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Use of drugs that act on the renin - angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death .
Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations .
Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia , anuria , hypotension , renal failure , and death .
When pregnancy is detected , discontinue perindopril erbumine as soon as possible .
These adverse outcomes are usually associated with use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy .
Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin - angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents .
Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus .
In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative to therapy with drugs affecting the renin - angiotensin system for a particular patient , apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus .
Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra - amniotic environment .
If oligohydramnios is observed , discontinue perindopril , unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother .
Fetal testing may be appropriate , based on the week of pregnancy .
Patients and physicians should be aware , however , that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury .
Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to perindopril for hypotension , oliguria , and hyperkalemia [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Radioactivity was detectable in fetuses after administration of 14 C - perindopril to pregnant rats .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Milk of lactating rats contained radioactivity following administration of 14 C - perindopril .
It is not known whether perindopril is secreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are secreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when perindopril is given to nursing mothers .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Neonates with a History of In Utero Exposure to Perindopril Erbumine If oliguria or hypotension occurs , direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion .
Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and / or substituting for disordered renal function .
Perindopril , which crosses the placenta , can theoretically be removed from the neonatal circulation by these means , but limited experience has not shown that such removal is central to the treatment of these infants .
Safety and effectiveness of perindopril in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use The mean blood pressure effect of perindopril was somewhat smaller in patients over 60 than in younger patients , although the difference was not significant .
Plasma concentrations of both perindopril and perindoprilat were increased in elderly patients compared to concentrations in younger patients .
No adverse effects were clearly increased in older patients with the exception of dizziness and possibly rash .
Start at a low dose and titrate slowly as needed .
Monitor for dizziness because of potential for falls .
Experience with perindopril in elderly patients at daily doses exceeding 8 mg is limited .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment may be necessary in renally impaired patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) andClinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment The bioavailability of perindoprilat is increased in patients with impaired hepatic function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE In animals , doses of perindopril up to 2 , 500 mg / kg in mice , 3 , 000 mg / kg in rats and 1 , 600 mg / kg in dogs were non - lethal .
Past experiences were scant but suggested that overdosage with other ACE inhibitors was also fairly well tolerated by humans .
The most likely manifestation is hypotension , and treatment should be symptomatic and supportive .
Therapy with the ACE inhibitor should be discontinued , and the patient should be observed .
Dehydration , electrolyte imbalance and hypotension should be treated by established procedures .
Among the reported cases of perindopril overdosage , patients who were known to have ingested a dose of 80 mg to 120 mg required assisted ventilation and circulatory support .
One additional patient developed hypothermia , circulatory arrest and died following ingestion of up to 180 mg of perindopril .
The intervention for perindopril overdose may require vigorous support .
Laboratory determinations of serum levels of perindopril and its metabolites are not widely available , and such determinations have , in any event , no established role in the management of perindopril overdose .
No data are available to suggest physiological maneuvers ( e . g . , maneuvers to change the pH of the urine ) that might accelerate elimination of perindopril and its metabolites .
Perindopril can be removed by hemodialysis , with clearance of 52 mL / min for perindopril and 67 mL / min for perindoprilat .
Angiotensin II could presumably serve as a specific antagonist - antidote in the settling of perindopril overdose , but angiotensin II is essentially unavailable outside of scattered research facilities .
Because the hypotensive effect of perindopril is achieved through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia , it is reasonable to treat perindopril overdose by infusion of normal saline solution .
11 DESCRIPTION Perindopril Erbumine Tablets USP contain the tert - butylamine salt of perindopril , the ethyl ester of a non - sulfhydryl angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor .
Perindopril erbumine USP is chemically described as ( 2 S , 3 aS , 7 aS ) - 1 - [ ( S ) - N - [ ( S ) - 1 - Carboxybutyl ] alanyl ] hexahydro - 2 - indolinecarboxylic acid , 1 - ethyl ester , compound with tert - butylamine ( 1 : 1 ) .
Its molecular formula is C19H32N2O5C4H11N .
Its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Perindopril erbumine is a white to almost white powder with a molecular weight of 368 . 47 ( free acid ) or 441 . 61 ( salt form ) .
It is freely soluble in water ( 60 % w / w ) , alcohol and chloroform .
Perindopril is the free acid form of perindopril erbumine , is a pro - drug and metabolized in vivo by hydrolysis of the ester group to form perindoprilat , the biologically active metabolite .
Perindopril Erbumine Tablets USP are available for oral administration containing either 2 mg , 4 mg or 8 mg strengths of perindopril erbumine .
Each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients : lactose ( anhydrous ) , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose and silicon dioxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Perindopril is a pro - drug for perindoprilat , which inhibits ACE in human subjects and animals .
The mechanism through which perindoprilat lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily inhibition of ACE activity .
ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes conversion of the inactive decapeptide , angiotensin I , to the vasoconstrictor , angiotensin II .
Angiotensin II is a potent peripheral vasoconstrictor , which stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex , and provides negative feedback on renin secretion .
Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II , leading to decreased vasoconstriction , increased plasma renin activity and decreased aldosterone secretion .
The latter results in diuresis and natriuresis and may be associated with a small increase of serum potassium .
ACE is identical to kininase II , an enzyme that degrades bradykinin .
Whether increased levels of bradykinin , a potent vasodepressor peptide , play a role in the therapeutic effects of perindopril remains to be elucidated .
While the principal mechanism of perindopril in blood pressure reduction is believed to be through the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system , ACE inhibitors have some effect even in apparent low - renin hypertension .
Perindopril has been studied in relatively few black patients , usually a low - renin population , and the average response of diastolic blood pressure to perindopril was about half the response seen in nonblack patients , a finding consistent with previous experience of other ACE inhibitors .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics After administration of perindopril , ACE is inhibited in a dose and blood concentration - related fashion , with the maximal inhibition of 80 to 90 % attained by 8 mg persisting for 10 to 12 hours .
Twenty - four hour ACE inhibition is about 60 % after these doses .
The degree of ACE inhibition achieved by a given dose appears to diminish over time ( the ID50 increases ) .
The pressor response to an angiotensin I infusion is reduced by perindopril , but this effect is not as persistent as the effect on ACE ; there is about 35 % inhibition at 24 hours after a 12 mg dose .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Oral administration of perindopril result in peak plasma concentrations that occur at approximately 1 hour .
The absolute oral bioavailability of perindopril is about 75 % .
Following absorption , approximately 30 to 50 % of systemically available perindopril is hydrolyzed to its active metabolite , perindoprilat , which has a mean bioavailability of about 25 % .
Peak plasma concentrations of perindoprilat are attained 3 to 7 hours after perindopril administration .
Oral administration of perindopril with food does not significantly lower the rate or extent of perindopril absorption relative to the fasted state .
However , the extent of biotransformation of perindopril to the active metabolite , perindoprilat , is reduced approximately 43 % , resulting in a reduction in the plasma ACE inhibition curve of approximately 20 % , probably clinically insignificant .
In clinical trials , perindopril was generally administered in a non - fasting state .
With 4 mg , 8 mg and 16 mg doses of perindopril , Cmax and AUC of perindopril and perindoprilat increase in a dose - proportional manner following both single oral dosing and at steady state during a once - a - day multiple dosing regimen .
Distribution Approximately 60 % of circulating perindopril is bound to plasma proteins , and only 10 to 20 % of perindoprilat is bound .
Therefore , drug interactions mediated through effects on protein binding are not anticipated .
Metabolism and Elimination Following oral administration perindopril exhibits multicompartment pharmacokinetics including a deep tissue compartment ( ACE binding sites ) .
The mean half - life of perindopril associated with most of its elimination is approximately 0 . 8 to 1 hour .
Perindopril is extensively metabolized following oral administration , with only 4 to 12 % of the dose recovered unchanged in the urine .
Six metabolites resulting from hydrolysis , glucuronidation and cyclization via dehydration have been identified .
These include the active ACE inhibitor , perindoprilat ( hydrolyzed perindopril ) , perindopril and perindoprilat glucuronides , dehydrated perindopril and the diastereoisomers of dehydrated perindoprilat .
In humans , hepatic esterase appears to be responsible for the hydrolysis of perindopril .
The active metabolite , perindoprilat , also exhibits multicompartment pharmacokinetics following the oral administration of perindopril .
Formation of perindoprilat is gradual with peak plasma concentrations occurring between 3 and 7 hours .
The subsequent decline in plasma concentration shows an apparent mean half - life of 3 to 10 hours for the majority of the elimination , with a prolonged terminal elimination half - life of 30 to 120 hours resulting from slow dissociation of perindoprilat from plasma / tissue ACE binding sites .
During repeated oral once daily dosing with perindopril , perindoprilat accumulates about 1 . 5 to 2 fold and attains steady state plasma levels in 3 to 6 days .
The clearance of perindoprilat and its metabolites is almost exclusively renal .
Elderly Plasma concentrations of both perindopril and perindoprilat in elderly patients ( greater than 70 years ) are approximately twice those observed in younger patients , reflecting both increased conversion of perindopril to perindoprilat and decreased renal excretion of perindoprilat [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) andUse in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Heart Failure Perindoprilat clearance is reduced in congestive heart failure patients , resulting in a 40 % higher dose interval AUC .
Renal Impairment With perindopril doses of 2 mg to 4 mg , perindoprilat AUC increases with decreasing renal function .
At creatinine clearances of 30 to 80 mL / min , AUC is about double that of 100 mL / min .
When creatinine clearance drops below 30 mL / min , AUC increases more markedly .
In a limited number of patients studied , perindopril clearance by dialysis ranged from about 40 to 80 mL / min .
Perindoprilat clearance by dialysis ranged from about 40 to 90 mL / min [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Hepatic Impairment The bioavailability of perindoprilat is increased in patients with impaired hepatic function .
Plasma concentrations of perindoprilat in patients with impaired liver function were about 50 % higher than those observed in healthy subjects or hypertensive patients with normal liver function .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis No evidence of carcinogenic effect was observed in studies in rats and mice when perindopril was administered at dosages up to 20 times ( mg / kg ) or 2 to 4 times ( mg / m2 ) the maximum proposed clinical doses ( 16 mg / day ) for 104 weeks .
Mutagenesis No genotoxic potential was detected for perindopril , perindoprilat and other metabolites in various in vitro and in vivo investigations , including the Ames test , the Saccharomyces cerevisiae D4 test , cultured human lymphocytes , TK ± mouse lymphoma assay , mouse and rat micronucleus tests and Chinese hamster bone marrow assay .
Impairment of Fertility There was no meaningful effect on reproductive performance or fertility in the rat given up to 30 times ( mg / kg ) or 6 times ( mg / m2 ) the proposed maximum clinical dosage of perindopril during the period of spermatogenesis in males or oogenesis and gestation in females .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Hypertension In placebo - controlled studies of perindopril monotherapy ( 2 mg to 16 mg once daily ) in patients with a mean blood pressure of about 150 / 100 mm Hg , 2 mg had little effect , but doses of 4 mg to 16 mg lowered blood pressure .
The 8 mg and 16 mg doses were indistinguishable , and both had a greater effect than the 4 mg dose .
In these studies , doses of 8 mg and 16 mg per day gave supine , trough blood pressure reductions of 9 to 15 / 5 to 6 mm Hg .
When once daily and twice daily dosing were compared , the twice daily dosing regimen was generally slightly superior , but by not more than about 0 . 5 mm Hg to 1 mm Hg .
After 2 mg to 16 mg doses of perindopril , the trough mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure effects were about 75 to 100 % of peak effects .
Perindopril ’ s effects on blood pressure were similar when given alone or on a background of 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide .
In general , the effect of perindopril occurred promptly , with effects increasing slightly over several weeks .
Formal interaction studies of perindopril have not been carried out with antihypertensive agents other than thiazides .
Limited experience in controlled and uncontrolled trials co - administering perindopril with a calcium channel blocker , a loop diuretic or triple therapy ( beta - blocker , vasodilator and a diuretic ) , does not suggest any unexpected interactions .
In general , ACE inhibitors have less than additive effects when given with beta - adrenergic blockers , presumably because both work in part through the renin - angiotensin system .
In uncontrolled studies in patients with insulin - dependent diabetes , perindopril did not appear to affect glycemic control .
In long - term use , no effect on urinary protein excretion was seen in these patients .
The effectiveness of perindopril was not influenced by sex and it was less effective in black patients than in nonblack patients .
In elderly patients ( greater than or equal to 60 years ) , the mean blood pressure effect was somewhat smaller than in younger patients , although the difference was not significant .
14 . 2 Stable Coronary Artery Disease The EURopean trial On reduction of cardiac events with Perindopril in stable coronary Artery disease ( EUROPA ) was a multicenter , randomized , double - blind and placebo - controlled study conducted in 12 , 218 patients who had evidence of stable coronary artery disease without clinical heart failure .
Patients had evidence of coronary artery disease documented by previous myocardial infarction more than 3 months before screening , coronary revascularization more than 6 months before screening , angiographic evidence of stenosis ( at least 70 % narrowing of one or more major coronary arteries ) , or positive stress test in men with a history of chest pain .
After a run - in period of 4 weeks during which all patients received perindopril 2 mg to 8 mg , the patients were randomly assigned to perindopril 8 mg once daily ( n = 6 , 110 ) or matching placebo ( n = 6 , 108 ) .
The mean follow - up was 4 . 2 years .
The study examined the long - term effects of perindopril on time to first event of cardiovascular mortality , nonfatal myocardial infarction , or cardiac arrest in patients with stable coronary artery disease .
The mean age of patients was 60 years ; 85 % were male , 92 % were taking platelet inhibitors , 63 % were taking β blockers , and 56 % were taking lipid - lowering therapy .
The EUROPA study showed that perindopril significantly reduced the relative risk for the primary endpoint events ( Table 1 ) .
This beneficial effect is largely attributable to a reduction in the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction .
This beneficial effect of perindopril on the primary outcome was evident after about one year of treatment ( Figure 1 ) .
The outcome was similar across all predefined subgroups by age , underlying disease or concomitant medication ( Figure 2 ) .
