( 2 . 4 ) • The above five - day courses may be repeated every 4 weeks for 2 courses , then every 4 to 5 weeks , if the patient has recovered from toxicity from the prior course .
( 2 . 4 ) • Do not adjust KHAPZORY dosage for toxicity .
( 2 . 4 ) 2 . 1 Important Use Information KHAPZORY is indicated for intravenous administration only .
Do not administer intrathecally .
2 . 2 Recommended Dosage for Rescue After High - Dose Methotrexate Therapy The recommended dosage for KHAPZORY is based on a methotrexate dose of 12 grams / m2 administered as intravenous infusion over 4 hours .
Twenty - four hours after starting the methotrexate infusion , initiate KHAPZORY at a dose of 7 . 5 mg ( approximately 5 mg / m2 ) as an intravenous infusion every 6 hours .
Monitor serum creatinine and methotrexate levels at least once daily .
Continue KHAPZORY , hydration , and urinary alkalinization ( pH of 7 or greater ) until the methotrexate level is below 5 x 10 - 8 M ( 0 . 05 micromolar ) .
Adjust the dose KHAPZORY or extend the duration as recommended in Table 1 .
Table 1 Recommended Dosage for KHAPZORY based on Serum Methotrexate and Creatinine Levels Clinical Situation Laboratory Findings Recommendation Normal methotrexate elimination Serum methotrexate level approximately 10 micromolar at 24 hours after administration , 1 micromolar at 48 hours , and less than 0 . 2 micromolar at 72 hours .
Administer 7 . 5 mg by intravenous infusion every 6 hours for 60 hours ( 10 doses starting at 24 hours after start of methotrexate infusion ) .
Delayed late methotrexate elimination Serum methotrexate level remaining above 0 . 2 micromolar at 72 hours , and more than 0 . 05 micromolar at 96 hours after administration .
Continue 7 . 5 mg by intravenous infusion every 6 hours , until methotrexate level is less than 0 . 05 micromolar .
Delayed early methotrexate elimination and / or evidence of acute renal injury * Serum methotrexate level of 50 micromolar or more at 24 hours , or 5 micromolar or more at 48 hours after administration , OR 100 % or greater increase in serum creatinine level at 24 hours after methotrexate administration ( e . g . , an increase from 0 . 5 mg / dL to a level of 1 mg / dL or more ) .
Administer 75 mg by intravenous infusion every 3 hours until methotrexate level is less than 1 micromolar ; then 7 . 5 mg by intravenous infusion every 3 hours until methotrexate level is less than 0 . 05 micromolar .
* These patients are likely to develop reversible renal failure .
In addition to appropriate KHAPZORY therapy , continue hydration and urinary alkalinization , and monitoring fluid and electrolyte status , until the serum methotrexate level has fallen to below 0 . 05 micromolar and the renal failure has resolved .
Impaired Methotrexate Elimination or Renal Impairment Decreased methotrexate elimination or renal impairment which are clinically important but less severe than the abnormalities described in Table 1 can occur following methotrexate administration .
If toxicity associated with methotrexate is observed , in subsequent courses extend KHAPZORY rescue for an additional 24 hours ( total of 14 doses over 84 hours ) .
Third - Space Fluid Collection and Other Causes of Delayed Methotrexate Elimination Accumulation in a third space fluid collection ( i . e . , ascites , pleural effusion ) , renal insufficiency , or inadequate hydration can delay methotrexate elimination .
Under such circumstances , higher doses of KHAPZORY or prolonged administration may be indicated .
2 . 3 Recommended Dosage for Overdosage of Folic Acid Antagonists or Impaired Methotrexate Elimination Start KHAPZORY as soon as possible after an overdosage of methotrexate or within 24 hours of methotrexate administration when methotrexate elimination is impaired .
As the time interval between methotrexate administration and KHAPZORY increases , the effectiveness of KHAPZORY to diminish methotrexate toxicity may decrease .
Administer KHAPZORY 7 . 5 mg ( approximately 5 mg / m2 ) as an intravenous infusion every 6 hours until the serum methotrexate level is less than 5 x 10 - 8 M ( 0 . 05 micromolar ) .
Monitor serum creatinine and methotrexate levels at least every 24 hours .
Increase the dosage of KHAPZORY to 50 mg / m2 intravenously every 3 hours and continue KHAPZORY at this dosage until the methotrexate level is less than 5 x 10 - 8 M for the following : • • if the serum creatinine at 24 - hours increases 50 % or more compared to baseline • • if the methotrexate level at 24 - hours is greater than 5 x 10 - 6 M • • if the methotrexate level at 48 - hours is greater than 9 x 10 - 7 M Continue concomitant hydration ( 3 L per day ) and urinary alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate .
Adjust the bicarbonate dose to maintain urine pH at 7 or greater .
2 . 4 Dosage in Combination with Fluorouracil for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer The following regimens have been used for the treatment of colorectal cancer : • • KHAPZORY 100 mg / m2 by intravenous injection over a minimum of 3 minutes , followed by fluorouracil at 370 mg / m2 by intravenous injection , once daily for 5 consecutive days • • KHAPZORY at 10 mg / m2 by intravenous injection , followed by fluorouracil at 425 mg / m2 , by intravenous injection once daily for 5 consecutive days This five - day course may be repeated every 4 weeks for 2 courses , then every 4 to 5 weeks , if the patient has recovered from toxicity from the prior course .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action High - Dose Methotrexate Therapy Levoleucovorin is the pharmacologically active isomer of 5 - formyl tetrahydrofolic acid .
Levoleucovorin does not require reduction by dihydrofolate reductase to participate in reactions utilizing folates as a source of “ one - carbon ” moieties .
Administration of levoleucovorin counteracts the therapeutic and toxic effects of folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate , which act by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase .
Combination with Fluorouracil in Colorectal Cancer Levoleucovorin enhances the therapeutic and toxic effects of fluorouracil .
Fluorouracil is metabolized to 5 - fluoro - 2 ' - deoxyuridine - 5 ' - monophosphate ( FdUMP ) , which binds to and inhibits thymidylate synthase ( an enzyme important in DNA repair and replication ) .
Levoleucovorin is converted to another reduced folate , 5 , 10 - methylenetetrahydrofolate , which then acts to stabilize the binding of FdUMP to thymidylate synthase , thereby enhancing the inhibition of thymidylate synthase .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of levoleucovorin after intravenous injection of a 15 mg dose was studied in healthy subjects .
The mean maximum serum total tetrahydrofolate ( total - THF ) concentration was 1722 ng / mL ( CV 39 % ) and the mean maximum serum ( 6 S ) - 5 - methyl - 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 - tetrahydrofolate concentration was 275 ng / mL ( CV 18 % ) observed around 0 . 9 hours post injection .
Distribution Exploratory studies show that small quantities of systemically administered leucovorin enter the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , primarily as its major metabolite 5 - methyltetrahydrofolate ( 5 - MTHFA ) .
In humans , the CSF levels of 5 - MTHFA remain 1 - 3 orders of magnitude lower than the usual methotrexate concentrations following intrathecal administration .
Elimination The mean terminal half - life was 5 . 1 hours for total - THF and 6 . 8 hours for ( 6 S ) - 5 - methyl - 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 - tetrahydrofolate .
Drug Interaction Studies The mean dose - normalized steady - state plasma concentrations for both levoleucovorin and 5 - methyl - THF were comparable whether fluorouracil ( 370 mg / m2 / day as an intravenous bolus ) was given in combination with levoleucovorin ( 250 mg / m2 and 1000 mg / m2 as a continuous intravenous infusion for 5 . 5 days ) or in combination with d , l - leucovorin ( 500 mg / m2 as a continuous intravenous infusion for 5 . 5 days ) .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No studies have been conducted to evaluate the potential of levoleucovorin for carcinogenesis , mutagenesis and impairment of fertility .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Rescue after High - Dose Methotrexate Therapy in Patients with Osteosarcoma The efficacy of levoleucovorin rescue following high - dose methotrexate were evaluated in 16 patients aged 6 to 21 years , who received 58 courses of therapy for osteogenic sarcoma .
High - dose methotrexate was one component of several different combination chemotherapy regimens evaluated across several trials .
Methotrexate 12 g / m2 as an intravenous infusion over 4 hours was administered to 13 patients , who received levoleucovorin 7 . 5 mg every 6 hours for 60 hours or longer beginning 24 hours after completion of methotrexate .
Three patients received methotrexate 12 . 5 g / m2 intravenously over 6 hours , followed by levoleucovorin 7 . 5 mg by intravenous infusion every 3 hours for 18 doses beginning 12 hours after completion of methotrexate .
The mean number of levoleucovorin doses per course was 18 . 2 and the mean total dose per course was 350 mg .
The efficacy of levoleucovorin rescue following high - dose methotrexate was based on adverse reaction profile [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
14 . 2 Metastatic Colorectal Cancer In a randomized clinical study conducted by the Mayo Clinic and the North Central Cancer Treatment Group ( NCCTG ) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer comparing d , l leucovorin 200 mg / m2 and fluorouracil 370 mg / m2 versus leucovorin 20 mg / m2 and fluorouracil 425 mg / m2 versus fluorouracil 500 mg / m2 , with all drugs administered by intravenous infusion daily for 5 days every 28 to 35 days , response rates were 26 % ( p = 0 . 04 versus fluorouracil alone ) , 43 % ( p = 0 . 001 versus fluorouracil alone ) , and 10 % , respectively .
Respective median survival times were 12 . 2 months ( p = 0 . 037 ) , 12 months ( p = 0 . 050 ) , and 7 . 7 months .
The low dose d , l - leucovorin regimen was associated with a statistically significant improvement in weight gain of more than 5 % , relief of symptoms , and improvement in performance status .
The high dose d , l - leucovorin regimen was associated with a statistically significant improvement in performance status and trended toward improvement in weight gain and in relief of symptoms but these were not statistically significant .
In a second randomized clinical study conducted by Mayo and NCCTG , the fluorouracil alone arm was replaced by sequentially administered methotrexate , fluorouracil , and d , l leucovorin .
Response rates with d , l leucovorin 200 mg / m2 and fluorouracil 370 mg / m2 versus d , l leucovorin 20 mg / m2 and fluorouracil 425 mg / m2 versus sequential methotrexate and fluorouracil and d , l leucovorin were 31 % ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ) , 42 % ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ) , and 14 % , respectively .
Respective median survival times were 12 . 7 months ( p ≤ 0 . 04 ) , 12 . 7 months ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ) , and 8 . 4 months .
There was no statistically significant difference in weight gain of more than 5 % or in improvement in performance status between the treatment arms .
A randomized controlled study conducted by the NCCTG in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer failed to show superiority of a regimen of fluorouracil + levoleucovorin to fluorouracil + d , l - leucovorin in overall survival .
Patients were randomized to fluorouracil 370 mg / m2 intravenously and levoleucovorin 100 mg / m2 intravenously , both daily for 5 days , or to fluorouracil 370 mg / m2 intravenously and d , l - leucovorin 200 mg / m2 intravenously , both daily for 5 days .
Treatment was repeated week 4 and week 8 , then every 5 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
