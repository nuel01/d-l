( 5 . 3 , 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Discontinue breastfeeding .
( 8 . 2 ) • Renal Impairment : Increases radiation exposure .
( 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Sodium Iodide I 131 Capsules Diagnostic is contraindicated in pregnancy because fetal exposure can lead to neonatal hypothyroidism , which in some cases is severe and irreversible .
Data from the published literature describe reports of neonatal thyroid abnormalities after fetal exposure , including agenesis of the thyroid and hypothyroidism ( see Clinical Considerations , Data ) .
No animal reproductive studies have been conducted .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Fetal / Neonatal Adverse Reactions A fetus exposed to sodium iodide I 131 can develop neonatal hypothyroidism .
Delay in diagnosis of neonatal hypothyroidism after exposure to sodium iodide I 131 in utero can result in severe sequelae such as decreased mental capacity and delayed skeletal maturation .
Monitor thyroid function in any infant born after in utero exposure to sodium iodide I 131 .
Data Human Data Literature reports of maternal exposures to sodium iodide I 131 at doses of 330 - 8300 MBq during 4 - 26 weeks estimated gestational age .
There were various adverse pregnancy outcomes ; the most common was hypothyroidism in infants and children .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Advise women to discontinue breastfeeding after administration of Sodium Iodide I 131 Capsules Diagnostic .
Infant exposure to sodium iodide I 131 via breast milk is expected and may lead to hypothyroidism in the infant because sodium iodide I 131 in breast milk may reach concentrations equal to or greater than concentrations in maternal plasma ( see Data ) .
Data Published studies show that sodium iodide I 131 is transferred into breast milk and is taken up by the thyroid of the breastfed infant .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Sodium Iodide I 131 is contraindicated in pregnancy because it causes fetal hypothyroidism [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Obtain a pregnancy test in females of reproductive potential and verify the absence of pregnancy before administering Sodium Iodide I 131 Capsules Diagnostic [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric use Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established .
Published reports suggest that the thyroid gland of pediatric patients is more sensitive to the adverse effects of sodium iodide I 131 ( e . g . , increased risk of radiation absorption ) .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical experience has not identified differences in safety or effectiveness in geriatric patients compared to younger patients .
However , elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function and radiation exposure is greater in patients with impaired renal function [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Radiation exposure following Sodium Iodide I 131 Capsules Diagnostic is greater in patients with impaired renal function compared to patients with normal renal function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of an overdosage of Sodium Iodide I 131 Capsules Diagnostic , monitor for thyroid suppression and consider administering a thyroid blocking agent ( e . g . potassium iodide ( KI ) or perchlorate ) .
Promote frequent voiding and encourage patients to maintain hydration to minimize radiation exposure .
11 DESCRIPTION 11 . 1 Chemical Characteristics Sodium Iodide I 131 Capsules Diagnostic is a radiodioactive diagnostic agent containing sodium iodide I 131 and supplied for oral administration in a gelatin capsule .
Each capsule contains no - carrier - added sodium iodide I 131 , disodium edetate dihydrate USP as a stabilizer , sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate USP as a reducing agent , and dibasic sodium phosphate anhydrous USP .
Sodium Iodide I 131 is designated chemically as Na131I and has a molecular weight of 153 . 99 .
11 . 2 Physical Characteristics Iodine I 131 decays by beta emission and associated gamma emission with a physical half - life of 8 . 04 days .
The principal radiation emissions are listed in Table 4 .

The first half - value thickness of lead ( Pb ) for iodine I 131 is 0 . 27 cm .
A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by iodine I 131 that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 5 .
For example , the use of 2 . 59 cm of Pb will decrease the external radiation exposure by a factor of about 100 .

Iodide is concentrated in follicular cells up to 50 times higher than in the plasma .
Iodide is metabolically oxidized by thyroid peroxidase to iodinium ( I + ) which in turn iodinates tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin ( tri or tetra - iodinated tyrosine ) .
The gamma emission of Iodine I 131 is imaged or counted .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration of Sodium Iodide I 131 Capsules Diagnostic , 90 % of the administered radioactivity of sodium iodide I 131 is systemically absorbed in the first 60 minutes .
Distribution Following absorption , sodium iodide I 131 is distributed within the extra - cellular space .
It is actively transported by the sodium - iodide symporter ( NIS ) protein and binds to thyroglobulin resulting in accumulation in the thyroid .
The thyroid uptake of iodide is usually increased in hyperthyroidism and in goiter , and is decreased in hypothyroidism .
Sodium iodide I 131 also accumulates in the stomach , choroid plexus , salivary glands breast , liver , gall bladder , and kidneys .
Elimination Metabolism In thyroid follicular cells , iodide is oxidized through the action of thyroid peroxidase to iodinium ( I + ) which in turn iodinates tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin .
Excretion Sodium iodide I 131 is excreted in urine and feces .
The normal range of urinary excretion is 37 % to 75 % of the administered dose , varying with the thyroid and renal function of the patient .
Fecal excretion is about 10 % .
