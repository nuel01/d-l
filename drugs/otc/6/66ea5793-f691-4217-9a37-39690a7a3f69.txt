MULTAQ is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
• Nursing mothers [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] • Permanent AF ( patients in whom normal sinus rhythm will not or cannot be restored ) ( Boxed Warning , 4 ) • Recently decompensated heart failure requiring hospitalization or Class IV heart failure .
( Boxed Warning , 4 ) • Second - or third - degree atrioventicular ( AV ) block or sick sinus syndrome ( except when used in conjunction with a functioning pacemaker ) ( 4 ) • Bradycardia < 50 bpm ( 4 ) • Concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor ( 4 ) • Concomitant use of drugs or herbal products that prolong the QT interval and may induce Torsade de Pointes ( 4 ) • Liver toxicity related to the previous use of amiodarone ( 4 ) • Severe hepatic impairment ( 4 ) • QTc Bazett interval ≥ 500 ms ( 4 ) • Pregnancy ( 4 , 8 . 1 ) and Nursing mothers ( 4 , 8 . 3 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Determine cardiac rhythm at least once every 3 months .
If AF is detected discontinue MULTAQ or cardiovert ( 5 . 2 ) .
• Liver injury : if hepatic injury is suspected , discontinue MULTAQ ( 5 . 5 ) • Ensure appropriate antithrombotic therapy prior to and throughout MULTAQ use .
( 5 . 3 ) • Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia : Maintain potassium and magnesium levels within the normal range ( 5 . 6 ) • Increase in creatinine : Monitor serum creatinine periodically ( 5 . 8 ) • 5 ) • Teratogen : Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception while using MULTAQ ( 5 . 9 ) 5 . 1 Cardiovascular Death in NYHA Class IV or Decompensated Heart Failure MULTAQ is contraindicated in patients with NYHA Class IV heart failure or symptomatic heart failure with recent decompensation requiring hospitalization because it doubles the risk of death .
5 . 2 Cardiovascular Death and Heart Failure in Permanent AF MULTAQ doubles the risk of cardiovascular death ( largely arrhythmic ) and heart failure events in patients with permanent AF .
Patients treated with dronedarone should undergo monitoring of cardiac rhythm no less often than every 3 months .
Cardiovert patients who are in atrial fibrillation ( if clinically indicated ) or discontinue MULTAQ .
MULTAQ offers no benefit in subjects in permanent AF .
5 . 3 Increased Risk of Stroke in Permanent AF In a placebo - controlled study in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation , dronedarone was associated with an increased risk of stroke , particularly in the first two weeks of therapy [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
MULTAQ should only be initiated in patients in sinus rhythm who are receiving appropriate antithrombotic therapy [ see Drug interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 4 New Onset or Worsening Heart Failure New onset or worsening of heart failure has been reported during treatment with MULTAQ in the postmarketing setting .
In a placebo controlled study in patients with permanent AF increased rates of heart failure were observed in patients with normal left ventricular function and no history of symptomatic heart failure , as well as those with a history of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction .
Advise patients to consult a physician if they develop signs or symptoms of heart failure , such as weight gain , dependent edema , or increasing shortness of breath .
If heart failure develops or worsens and requires hospitalization , discontinue MULTAQ .
5 . 5 Liver Injury Hepatocellular liver injury , including acute liver failure requiring transplant , has been reported in patients treated with MULTAQ in the post - marketing setting .
Advise patients treated with MULTAQ to report immediately symptoms suggesting hepatic injury ( such as anorexia , nausea , vomiting , fever , malaise , fatigue , right upper quadrant pain , jaundice , dark urine , or itching ) .
Consider obtaining periodic hepatic serum enzymes , especially during the first 6 months of treatment , but it is not known whether routine periodic monitoring of serum enzymes will prevent the development of severe liver injury .
If hepatic injury is suspected , promptly discontinue MULTAQ and test serum enzymes , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and alkaline phosphatase , as well as serum bilirubin , to establish whether there is liver injury .
If liver injury is found , institute appropriate treatment and investigate the probable cause .
Do not restart MULTAQ in patients without another explanation for the observed liver injury .
5 . 6 Hypokalemia and Hypomagnesemia with Potassium - Depleting Diuretics Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may occur with concomitant administration of potassium - depleting diuretics .
Potassium levels should be within the normal range prior to administration of MULTAQ and maintained in the normal range during administration of MULTAQ .
5 . 7 QT Interval Prolongation Dronedarone induces a moderate ( average of about 10 ms but much greater effects have been observed ) QTc ( Bazett ) prolongation [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
If the QTc Bazett interval is ≥ 500 ms , discontinue MULTAQ [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
5 . 8 Increase in Creatinine after Treatment Initiation Small increases in creatinine levels ( about 0 . 1 mg / dL ) following dronedarone treatment initiation have been shown to be a result of inhibition of creatinine ' s tubular secretion .
..
The elevation has a rapid onset , reaches a plateau after 7 days and is reversible after discontinuation .
Larger increases in creatinine after dronedarone initiation have been reported in the postmarketing setting .
Some cases also reported increases in blood urea nitrogen .
In most cases , these effects appear to be reversible upon drug discontinuation .
Monitor renal function periodically .
5 . 9 Women of Childbearing Potential Premenopausal women who have not undergone a hysterectomy or oophorectomy must use effective contraception while using MULTAQ .
Dronedarone caused fetal harm in animal studies at doses equivalent to recommended human doses .
Counsel women of childbearing potential regarding appropriate contraceptive choices .
[ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following safety concerns are described elsewhere in the label : • New or worsening heart failure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Liver Injury [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia with potassium - depleting diuretics [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • QT prolongation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 2 % ) are diarrhea , nausea , abdominal pain , vomiting , and asthenia ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact sanofi - aventis U . S . LLC at 1 - 800 - 633 - 1610 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch 6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience The safety evaluation of dronedarone 400 mg twice daily in patients with AF or AFL is based on 5 placebo controlled studies , ATHENA , EURIDIS , ADONIS , ERATO and DAFNE .
In these studies , a total of 6285 patients were randomized and treated , 3282 patients with MULTAQ 400 mg twice daily , and 2875 with placebo .
The mean exposure across studies was 12 months .
In ATHENA , the maximum follow - up was 30 months .
In clinical trials , premature discontinuation because of adverse reactions occurred in 11 . 8 % of the dronedarone - treated patients and in 7 . 7 % of the placebo - treated group .
The most common reasons for discontinuation of therapy with MULTAQ were gastrointestinal disorders ( 3 . 2 % versus 1 . 8 % in the placebo group ) and QT prolongation ( 1 . 5 % versus 0 . 5 % in the placebo group ) .
The most frequent adverse reactions observed with MULTAQ 400 mg twice daily in the 5 studies were diarrhea , nausea , abdominal pain , vomiting , and asthenia .
Table 1 displays adverse reactions more common with dronedarone 400 mg twice daily than with placebo in AF or AFL patients , presented by system organ class and by decreasing order of frequency .
Adverse laboratory and ECG effects are presented separately in Table 2 .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of MULTAQ .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Cardiac : New or worsening heart failure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] Hepatic : Liver Injury [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] Respiratory : Postmarketing cases of interstitial lung disease including pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis have been reported .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Dronedarone is metabolized primarily by CYP 3 A and is a moderate inhibitor of CYP 3 A and CYP 2D6 [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Dronedarone ' s blood levels can therefore be affected by inhibitors and inducers of CYP 3 A , and dronedarone can interact with drugs that are substrates of CYP 3 A and CYP 2D6 .
Dronedarone has no significant potential to inhibit CYP 1A2 , CYP 2C9 , CYP 2C19 , CYP 2C8 and CYP 2B6 .
It has the potential to inhibit P - glycoprotein ( P - gP ) transport .
Pharmacodynamic interactions can be expected with beta - blockers ; calcium antagonists and digoxin [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
In clinical trials , patients treated with dronedarone received concomitant medications including beta - blockers , digoxin , calcium antagonists ( including those with heart rate - lowering effects ) , statins and oral anticoagulants .
Dronedarone is metabolized by CYP 3 A and is a moderate inhibitor of CYP 3 A and CYP 2D6 and has potentially important pharmacodynamic interactions ( 7 ) • Antiarrhythmics : Avoid concomitant use ( 4 , 7 . 1 ) • Digoxin : Consider discontinuation or halve dose of digoxin before treatment and monitor digoxin levels ( 7 . 1 , 7 . 3 ) • Calcium channel blockers ( CCB ) : Initiate CCB with low dose and increase after ECG verification of tolerability ( 7 . 1 , 7 . 2 , 7 . 3 ) • Beta - blockers : May provoke excessive bradycardia , Initiate with low dose and increase after ECG verification of tolerability ( 7 . 1 , 7 . 3 ) • CYP 3 A inducers : Avoid concomitant use ( 7 . 2 ) • Grapefruit juice : Avoid concomitant use ( 7 . 2 ) • Statins : Follow label recommendations for concomitant use of certain statins with a CYP 3 A and P - gP inhibitor like dronedarone ( 7 . 3 ) • CYP 3 A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index ( e . g . , sirolimus and tacrolimus ) : Monitor and adjust dosage of concomitant drug as needed when used with MULTAQ ( 7 . 3 ) • Warfarin : Monitor INR after initiating dronedarone in patients taking warfarin .
( 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Pharmacodynamic Interactions Drugs prolonging the QT interval ( inducing Torsade de Pointes ) Co - administration of drugs prolonging the QT interval ( such as certain phenothiazines , tricyclic antidepressants , certain macrolide antibiotics , and Class I and III antiarrhythmics ) is contraindicated because of the potential risk of Torsade de Pointes - type ventricular tachycardia [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Digoxin Digoxin can potentiate the electrophysiologic effects of dronedarone ( such as decreased AV - node conduction ) .
In clinical trials , increased levels of digoxin were observed when dronedarone was co - administered with digoxin .
Gastrointestinal disorders were also increased .
Because of the pharmacokinetic interaction [ see Drug Interaction ( 7 . 3 ) ] and possible pharmacodynamic interaction , consider the need for continued digoxin therapy .
If digoxin treatment is continued , halve the dose of digoxin , monitor serum levels closely , and observe for toxicity .
Calcium channel blockers Calcium channel blockers with depressant effects on the sinus and AV nodes could potentiate dronedarone ' s effects on conduction .
Give low doses of calcium channel blockers initially and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
Beta - blockers In clinical trials , bradycardia was more frequently observed when dronedarone was given in combination with beta - blockers .
Give low dose of beta - blockers initially , and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Effects of Other Drugs on Dronedarone Ketoconazole and other potent CYP 3 A inhibitors Repeated doses of ketoconazole , a strong CYP 3 A inhibitor , resulted in a 17 - fold increase in dronedarone exposure and a 9 - fold increase in Cmax .
Concomitant use of ketoconazole as well as other potent CYP 3 A inhibitors such as itraconazole , voriconazole , ritonavir , clarithromycin , and nefazodone is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Grapefruit juice Grapefruit juice , a moderate inhibitor of CYP 3 A , resulted in a 3 - fold increase in dronedarone exposure and a 2 . 5 - fold increase in Cmax .
Therefore , patients should avoid grapefruit juice beverages while taking MULTAQ .
Rifampin and other CYP 3 A inducers Rifampin decreased dronedarone exposure by 80 % .
Avoid rifampin or other CYP 3 A inducers such as phenobarbital , carbamazepine , phenytoin , and St John ' s wort with dronedarone because they decrease its exposure significantly .
Calcium channel blockers Verapamil and diltiazem are moderate CYP 3 A inhibitors and increase dronedarone exposure by approximately 1 . 4 - to 1 . 7 - fold [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 , 7 . 3 ) ] .
Pantoprazole Pantoprazole , a drug that increases gastric pH , did not have a significant effect on dronedarone pharmacokinetics .
7 . 3 Effects of Dronedarone on Other Drugs Statins Dronedarone increased simvastatin / simvastatin acid exposure by 4 - and 2 - fold , respectively .
Because of multiple mechanisms of interaction with statins ( CYPs and transporters ) , follow statin label recommendations for use with CYP 3 A and P - gP inhibitors such as dronedarone .
Calcium channel blockers Dronedarone increases calcium channel blocker ( verapamil , diltiazem or nifedipine ) exposure by 1 . 4 - to 1 . 5 - fold [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Sirolimus , tacrolimus , and other CYP3A substrates with narrow therapeutic range Dronedarone can increase plasma concentrations of tacrolimus , sirolimus , and other CYP 3 A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range when given orally .
Monitor plasma concentrations and adjust dosage appropriately .
Beta - blockers and other CYP 2D6 substrates Dronedarone increased propranolol exposure by approximately 1 . 3 - fold following single dose administration .
Dronedarone increased metoprolol exposure by 1 . 6 - fold following multiple dose administration [ see Drug Interaction ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Other CYP 2D6 substrates , including other beta - blockers , tricyclic antidepressants , and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) may have increased exposure upon co - administration with dronedarone .
P - glycoprotein substrates Digoxin Dronedarone increased digoxin exposure by 2 . 5 - fold by inhibiting the P - gP transporter [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Dabigatran Exposure to dabigatran is higher when it is administered with dronedarone than when it is administered alone ( 1 . 7 - to 2 - fold ) .
Other P - gP substrates are expected to have increased exposure when co - administered with dronedarone .
Warfarin and losartan ( CYP 2C9 substrates ) Losartan No interaction was observed between dronedarone and losartan .
Warfarin When healthy subjects were administered dronedarone 600 mg twice daily , exposure to S - warfarin was higher than when warfarin was administered alone ( 1 . 2 - fold ) .
Exposure to R - warfarin was unchanged and there were no clinically significant increases in INR .
More patients experienced clinically significant INR elevations ( ≥ 5 ) usually within 1 week after starting dronedarone vs . placebo in patients taking oral anticoagulants in ATHENA .
However , no excess risk of bleeding was observed in the dronedarone group .
Postmarketing cases of increased INR with or without bleeding events have been reported in warfarin - treated patients initiated on dronedarone .
Monitor INR after initiating dronedarone in patients taking warfarin .
Theophylline ( CYP 1A2 substrate ) Dronedarone does not increase steady state theophylline exposure .
Oral contraceptives No decreases in ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel concentrations were observed in healthy subjects receiving dronedarone concomitantly with oral contraceptives .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] MULTAQ may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
In animal studies , dronedarone was teratogenic in rats at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) , and in rabbits at half the MRHD .
If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus .
When pregnant rats received dronedarone at oral doses greater than or equal to the MRHD ( on a mg / m2 basis ) , fetuses had increased rates of external , visceral and skeletal malformations ( cranioschisis , cleft palate , incomplete evagination of pineal body , brachygnathia , partially fused carotid arteries , truncus arteriosus , abnormal lobation of the liver , partially duplicated inferior vena cava , brachydactyly , ectrodactylia , syndactylia , and anterior and / or posterior club feet ) .
When pregnant rabbits received dronedarone , at a dose approximately half the MRHD ( on a mg / m2 basis ) , fetuses had an increased rate of skeletal abnormalities ( anomalous ribcage and vertebrae , pelvic asymmetry ) at doses ≥ 20 mg / kg ( the lowest dose tested and approximately half the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Actual animal doses : rat ( ≥ 80 mg / kg / day ) ; rabbit ( ≥ 20 mg / kg ) 8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether MULTAQ is excreted in human milk .
Dronedarone and its metabolites are excreted in rat milk .
During a pre - and post - natal study in rats , maternal dronedarone administration was associated with minor reduced body - weight gain in the offspring .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from MULTAQ , discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in children below the age of 18 years have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use More than 4500 patients with AF or AFL aged 65 years or above were included in the MULTAQ clinical program ( of whom more than 2000 patients were 75 years or older ) .
Efficacy and safety were similar in elderly and younger patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Patients with renal impairment were included in clinical studies .
Because renal excretion of dronedarone is minimal [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , no dosing alteration is needed .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Dronedarone is extensively metabolized by the liver .
There is little clinical experience with moderate hepatic impairment and none with severe impairment .
No dosage adjustment is recommended for moderate hepatic impairment [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of overdosage , monitor the patient ' s cardiac rhythm and blood pressure .
Treatment should be supportive and based on symptoms .
It is not known whether dronedarone or its metabolites can be removed by dialysis ( hemodialysis , peritoneal dialysis or hemofiltration ) .
There is no specific antidote available .
11 DESCRIPTION Dronedarone HCl is a benzofuran derivative with the following chemical name : N - { 2 - butyl - 3 - [ 4 - ( 3 - dibutylaminopropoxy ) benzoyl ] benzofuran - 5 - yl } methanesulfonamide , hydrochloride .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of dronedarone is unknown .
Dronedarone has antiarrhythmic properties belonging to all four Vaughan - Williams classes , but the contribution of each of these activities to the clinical effect is unknown .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Electrophysiological effects Dronedarone exhibits properties of all four Vaughn - Williams antiarrhythmic classes , although it is unclear which of these are important in producing dronedarone ' s clinical effects .
The effect of dronedarone on 12 - lead ECG parameters ( heart rate , PR , and QTc ) was investigated in healthy subjects following repeated oral doses up to 1600 mg once daily or 800 mg twice daily for 14 days and 1600 mg twice daily for 10 days .
In the dronedarone 400 mg twice daily group , there was no apparent effect on heart rate ; a moderate heart rate lowering effect ( about 4 bpm ) was noted at 800 mg twice daily .
There was a clear dose - dependent effect on PR - interval with an increase of + 5 ms at 400 mg twice daily and up to + 50 ms at 1600 mg twice daily .
There was a moderate dose related effect on the QTc - interval with an increase of + 10 ms at 400 mg twice daily and up to + 25 ms with 1600 mg twice daily .
DAFNE study DAFNE was a dose - response study in patients with recurrent AF , evaluating the effect of dronedarone in comparison with placebo in maintaining sinus rhythm .
The doses of dronedarone in this study were 400 , 600 , and 800 mg twice a day .
In this small study , doses above 400 mg were not more effective and were less well tolerated .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Dronedarone is extensively metabolized and has low systemic bioavailability ; its bioavailability is increased by meals .
Its elimination half life is 13 – 19 hours .
Absorption Because of presystemic first pass metabolism the absolute bioavailability of dronedarone without food is low , about 4 % .
It increases to approximately 15 % when dronedarone is administered with a high fat meal .
After oral administration in fed conditions , peak plasma concentrations of dronedarone and the main circulating active metabolite ( N - debutyl metabolite ) are reached within 3 to 6 hours .
After repeated administration of 400 mg twice daily , steady state is reached within 4 to 8 days of treatment and the mean accumulation ratio for dronedarone ranges from 2 . 6 to 4 . 5 .
The steady state Cmax and exposure of the main N - debutyl metabolite is similar to that of the parent compound .
The pharmacokinetics of dronedarone and its N - debutyl metabolite both deviate moderately from dose proportionality : a 2 - fold increase in dose results in an approximate 2 . 5 - to 3 . 0 - fold increase with respect to Cmax and AUC .
Distribution The in vitro plasma protein binding of dronedarone and its N - debutyl metabolite is > 98 % and not saturable .
Both compounds bind mainly to albumin .
After intravenous ( IV ) administration the volume of distribution at steady state is about 1400 L . Metabolism Dronedarone is extensively metabolized , mainly by CYP 3 A .
The initial metabolic pathway includes N - debutylation to form the active N - debutyl metabolite , oxidative deamination to form the inactive propanoic acid metabolite , and direct oxidation .
The metabolites undergo further metabolism to yield over 30 uncharacterized metabolites .
The N - debutyl metabolite exhibits pharmacodynamic activity but is 1 / 10 to 1 / 3 as potent as dronedarone Excretion / Elimination In a mass balance study with orally administered dronedarone ( 14 C - labeled ) approximately 6 % of the labeled dose was excreted in urine , mainly as metabolites ( no unchanged compound excreted in urine ) , and 84 % was excreted in feces , mainly as metabolites .
Dronedarone and its N - debutyl active metabolite accounted for less than 15 % of the resultant radioactivity in the plasma .
After IV administration the plasma clearance of dronedarone ranges from 130 to 150 L / h .
The elimination half - life of dronedarone ranges from 13 to 19 hours .
Special populations Gender Dronedarone exposures are on average 30 % higher in females than in males .
Race Pharmacokinetic differences related to race were not formally assessed .
However , based on a cross study comparison , following single dose administration ( 400 mg ) , Asian males ( Japanese ) have about a 2 - fold higher exposure than Caucasian males .
The pharmacokinetics of dronedarone in other races has not been assessed .
Elderly Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of dronedarone , 73 % were 65 years of age and over and 34 % were 75 and over .
In patients aged 65 years old and above , dronedarone exposures are 23 % higher than in patients less than 65 years old [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Hepatic impairment In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment , the mean dronedarone exposure increased by 1 . 3 - fold relative to subjects with normal hepatic function and the mean exposure of the N - debutyl metabolite decreased by about 50 % .
Pharmacokinetic data were significantly more variable in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment .
The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of dronedarone was not assessed [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Renal impairment Consistent with the low renal excretion of dronedarone , no pharmacokinetic difference was observed in subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
No pharmacokinetic difference was observed in patients with mild to severe renal impairment in comparison with patients with normal renal function .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In studies in which dronedarone was administered to rats and mice for up to 2 years at doses of up to 70 mg / kg / day and 300 mg / kg / day , respectively , there was an increased incidence of histiocytic sarcomas in dronedarone - treated male mice ( 300 mg / kg / day or 5 × the maximum recommended human dose based on AUC comparisons ) , mammary adenocarcinomas in dronedarone - treated female mice ( 300 mg / kg / day or 8 × MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) and hemangiomas in dronedarone - treated male rats ( 70 mg / kg / day or 5 × MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
Dronedarone did not demonstrate genotoxic potential in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test , the Ames bacterial mutation assay , the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay , or an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes .
S - 9 processed dronedarone , however , was positive in a V79 transfected Chinese hamster V79 assay .
In fertility studies conducted with female rats , dronedarone given prior to breeding and implantation caused an increase in irregular estrus cycles and cessation of cycling at doses ≥ 10 mg / kg ( equivalent to 0 . 12 × the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Corpora lutea , implantations and live fetuses were decreased at 100 mg / kg ( equivalent to 1 . 2 × the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis ) .
There were no reported effects on mating behavior or fertility of male rats at doses of up to 100 mg / kg / day .
13 . 3 Developmental Toxicity Dronedarone was teratogenic in rats given oral doses ≥ 80 mg / kg / day ( a dose equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose [ MHRD ] on a mg / m2 basis ) , with fetuses showing external , visceral and skeletal malformations ( cranioschisis , cleft palate , incomplete evagination of pineal body , brachygnathia , partially fused carotid arteries , truncus arteriosus , abnormal lobation of the liver , partially duplicated inferior vena cava , brachydactyly , ectrodactylia , syndactylia , and anterior and / or posterior club feet ) .
In rabbits , dronedarone caused an increase in skeletal abnormalities ( anomalous ribcage and vertebrae , pelvic asymmetry ) at doses ≥ 20 mg / kg ( the lowest dose tested and approximately half the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 ATHENA ATHENA was a multicenter , multinational , double blind , and randomized placebo - controlled study of dronedarone in 4628 patients with a recent history of AF / AFL who were in sinus rhythm or who were to be converted to sinus rhythm .
The objective of the study was to determine whether dronedarone could delay death from any cause or hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons .
Initially patients were to be ≥ 70 years old , or < 70 years old with at least one risk factor ( including hypertension , diabetes , prior cerebrovascular accident , left atrial diameter ≥ 50 mm or LVEF < 0 . 40 ) .
The inclusion criteria were later changed such that patients were to be ≥ 75 years old , or ≥ 70 years old with at least one risk factor .
Patients had to have both AF / AFL and sinus rhythm documented within the previous 6 months .
Patients could have been in AF / AFL or in sinus rhythm at the time of randomization , but patients not in sinus rhythm were expected to be either electrically or chemically converted to normal sinus rhythm after anticoagulation .
Subjects were randomized and treated for up to 30 months ( median follow - up : 22 months ) with either MULTAQ 400 mg twice daily ( 2301 patients ) or placebo ( 2327 patients ) , in addition to conventional therapy for cardiovascular diseases that included beta - blockers ( 71 % ) , ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers ( ARBs ) ( 69 % ) , digoxin ( 14 % ) , calcium antagonists ( 14 % ) , statins ( 39 % ) , oral anticoagulants ( 60 % ) , aspirin ( 44 % ) , other chronic antiplatelet therapy ( 6 % ) and diuretics ( 54 % ) .
The primary endpoint of the study was the time to first hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons or death from any cause .
Time to death from any cause , time to first hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons , and time to cardiovascular death and time to all causes of death were also explored .
Patients ranged in age from 23 to 97 years ; 42 % were 75 years old or older .
Forty - seven percent ( 47 % ) of patients were female and a majority was Caucasian ( 89 % ) .
Approximately seventy percent ( 71 % ) of those enrolled had no history of heart failure .
The median ejection fraction was 60 % .
Twenty - nine percent ( 29 % ) of patients had heart failure , mostly NYHA class II ( 17 % ) .
The majority had hypertension ( 86 % ) and structural heart disease ( 60 % ) .
Results are shown in Table 3 .
MULTAQ reduced the combined endpoint of cardiovascular hospitalization or death from any cause by 24 . 2 % when compared to placebo .
This difference was entirely attributable to its effect on cardiovascular hospitalization , principally hospitalization related to AF .
Other endpoints , death from any cause and first hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons , are shown in Table 3 .
Secondary endpoints count all first events of a particular type , whether or not they were preceded by a different type of event .

The event curves separated early and continued to diverge over the 30 month follow - up period .
Figure 1 : Kaplan - Meier Cumulative Incidence Curves from Randomization to First Cardiovascular Hospitalization or Death from any Cause [ MULTIMEDIA ] Reasons for hospitalization included major bleeding ( 1 % in both groups ) , syncope ( 1 % in both groups ) , and ventricular arrhythmia ( < 1 % in both groups ) .
The reduction in cardiovascular hospitalization or death from any cause was generally consistent in all subgroups based on baseline characteristics or medications ( ACE inhibitors or ARBs ; beta - blockers , digoxin , statins , calcium channel blockers , diuretics ) ( see Figure 2 ) .

Patients had at least one ECG - documented AF / AFL episode during the 3 months prior to study entry but were in sinus rhythm for at least one hour .
Patients ranged in age from 20 to 88 years , with the majority being Caucasian ( 97 % ) , male ( 70 % ) patients .
The most common co - morbidities were hypertension ( 56 . 8 % ) and structural heart disease ( 41 . 5 % ) , including coronary heart disease ( 21 . 8 % ) .
Patients were followed for 12 months .
In the pooled data from EURIDIS and ADONIS as well as in the individual trials , dronedarone delayed the time to first recurrence of AF / AFL ( primary endpoint ) , lowering the risk of first AF / AFL recurrence during the 12 - month study period by about 25 % , with an absolute difference in recurrence rate of about 11 % at 12 months .
14 . 3 ANDROMEDA Patients recently hospitalized with symptomatic heart failure and severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction ( wall motion index ≤ 1 . 2 ) were randomized to either MULTAQ 400 mg twice daily or matching placebo , with a primary composite end point of all - cause mortality or hospitalization for heart failure .
Patients enrolled in ANDROMEDA were predominantly NYHA Class II ( 40 % ) and III ( 57 % ) , and only 25 % had AF at randomization .
After enrollment of 627 patients and a median follow - up of 63 days , the trial was terminated because of excess mortality in the dronedarone group .
Twenty - five ( 25 ) patients in the dronedarone group died versus 12 patients in the placebo group ( hazard ratio 2 . 13 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 07 to 4 . 25 ) .
The main reason for death was worsening heart failure .
There were also excess hospitalizations for cardiovascular reasons in the dronedarone group ( 71 versus 51 for placebo ) [ see Boxed Warning and Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
14 . 4 PALLAS Patients with permanent AF ( AF documented in 2 weeks prior to randomization and at least 6 months prior to randomization in whom cardioversion had failed or was not planned ) and additional risk factors for thromboembolism ( coronary artery disease , prior stroke or TIA , symptomatic heart failure , LVEF < 40 % , peripheral arterial occlusive disease , or age > 75 with hypertension and diabetes ) were randomized to dronedarone 400 mg twice daily or placebo .
After enrollment of 3236 patients ( placebo = 1617 and dronedarone = 1619 ) and a median follow up of 3 . 7 months days for placebo and 3 . 9 for dronedarone , the study was terminated because of a significant increase in • Mortality : 25 dronedarone vs . 13 placebo ( HR , 1 . 94 ; CI , 0 . 99 to 3 . 79 ) .
The majority of deaths in the dronedarone group were classified as arrhythmic / sudden deaths ( HR , 3 . 26 ; CI : 1 . 06 to 10 . 0 ) .
Baseline digoxin therapy was reported in 11 / 13 dronedarone patients who died of arrhythmia .
None of the arrhythmic deaths on placebo ( 4 ) reported use of digoxin .
• Stroke : 23 dronedarone vs . 10 placebo ( HR , 2 . 32 ; CI : 1 . 11 to 4 . 88 ) .
The increased risk of stroke observed with dronedarone was observed in the first two weeks of therapy ( 10 dronedarone vs . 1 placebo ) , most of the subjects treated with dronedarone did not have an INR of 2 . 0 to 3 . 0 .
[ see Warning and Precaution ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Hospitalizations for heart failure in the dronedarone group : 43 dronedarone vs . 24 placebo ( HR , 1 . 81 ; CI : 1 . 10 to 2 . 99 ) .
