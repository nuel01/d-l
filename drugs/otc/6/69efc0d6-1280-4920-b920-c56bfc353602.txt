Dosing and Administration , Dosing in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Interventions ( 2 . 2 ) 5 / 2016 1 INDICATIONS & USAGE Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor indicated : • For prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in adult patients with heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) ( 1 . 1 ) • As an anticoagulant in adults patients with or at risk for HIT undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) ( 1 . 2 ) 1 . 1 Heparin - Induced Thrombocytopenia Argatroban Injection is indicated for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in adult patients with heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) .
1 . 2 Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Argatroban Injection is indicated as an anticoagulant in adult patients with or at risk for HIT undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .
2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Each 125 mL glass vial contains 125 mg of argatroban ( 1 mg / mL ) ; and , as supplied , is ready for intravenous infusion .
Dilution is not required .
Argatroban Injection is a clear , colorless to pale yellow solution .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit .
Do not use if the solution is cloudy , contains precipitates , or if the flip - off seal is not intact .
• Argatroban 125 mg in 125 mL aqueous sodium chloride solution ( 1 mg / mL ) is intended for administration to adult patients ( 2 . 1 ) • Discontinue all parenteral anticoagulants before administering Argatroban Injection ( 2 . 1 ) • Adjust dosing in patients with HIT who have moderate or severe hepatic impairment ( 2 . 3 ) Heparin - Induced Thrombocytopenia ( 2 . 1 ) The dose for heparin - induced thrombocytopenia without hepatic impairment is 2 mcg / kg / min administered as a continuous infusion ( 2 . 1 ) • Discontinue heparin therapy and obtain a baseline aPTT before administering Argatroban ( 2 . 1 ) • After the initial dose of Argatroban , the dose can be adjusted as clinically indicated ( 2 . 1 ) Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( 2 . 2 ) The dose for patients with or at risk for heparin - induced thrombocytopenia undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention is started at 25 mcg / kg / min and a bolus of 350 mcg / kg administered via a large bore intravenous line over 3 to 5 minutes ( 2 . 2 ) • Activated clotting time ( ACT ) should be checked 5 to 10 minutes after the bolus dose is completed .
The procedure may proceed if the ACT is greater than 300 seconds ( 2 . 2 ) • Monitoring therapy and dosage adjustments recommendations should be followed ( 2 . 2 ) • See special dosing recommendations for hepatic and renal impaired patients ( 2 . 3 ) 2 . 1 Dosing in Patients With Heparin - Induced Thrombocytopenia Initial Dosage : Before administering argatroban , discontinue heparin therapy and obtain a baseline aPTT .
The recommended initial dose of argatroban for adult patients without hepatic impairment is 2 mcg / kg / min , administered as a continuous infusion ( see Table 1 ) .
Table 1 .
Recommended Doses and Infusion Rates for 2 mcg / kg / min Dose of Argatroban for Patients With HIT1 and Without Hepatic Impairment ( 1 mg / mL Concentration ) Body Weight ( kg ) Dose ( mcg / min ) Infusion Rate ( mL / hr ) 50 100 6 60 120 7 70 140 8 80 160 10 90 180 11 100 200 12 110 220 13 120 240 14 130 260 16 140 280 17 1 with or without thrombosis Monitoring Therapy : For use in HIT , therapy with Argatroban Injection is monitored using the aPTT with a target range of 1 . 5 to 3 times the initial baseline value ( not to exceed 100 seconds ) .
Tests of anticoagulant effects ( including the aPTT ) typically attain steady - state levels within 1 to 3 hours following initiation of Argatroban Injection .
Check the aPTT 2 hours after initiation of therapy and after any dose change to confirm that the patient has attained the desired therapeutic range .
Dosage Adjustment : After the initiation of Argatroban Injection , adjust the dose ( not to exceed 10 mcg / kg / min ) as necessary to obtain a steady - state aPTT in the target range [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 2 Dosing in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Interventions Initial Dosage : Initiate an infusion of Argatroban Injection at 25 mcg / kg / min and administer a bolus of 350 mcg / kg via a large bore intravenous line over 3 to 5 minutes ( see Table 2 ) .
Check an activated clotting time ( ACT ) 5 to 10 minutes after the bolus dose is completed .
The PCI procedure may proceed if the ACT is greater than 300 seconds .
Dosage Adjustment : If the ACT is less than 300 seconds , an additional intravenous bolus dose of 150 mcg / kg should be administered , the infusion dose increased to 30 mcg / kg / min , and the ACT checked 5 to 10 minutes later ( see Table 2 ) .
If the ACT is greater than 450 seconds , decrease the infusion rate to 15 mcg / kg / min , and check the ACT 5 to 10 minutes later ( Table 3 ) .
Continue titrating the dose until a therapeutic ACT ( between 300 and 450 seconds ) has been achieved ; continue the same infusion rate for the duration of the PCI procedure .
In case of dissection , impending abrupt closure , thrombus formation during the procedure , or inability to achieve or maintain an ACT over 300 seconds , additional bolus doses of 150 mcg / kg may be administered and the infusion dose increased to 40 mcg / kg / min .
Check the ACT after each additional bolus or change in the rate of infusion .

Monitoring Therapy : For use in PCI , therapy with Argatroban Injection is monitored using ACT .
Obtain ACTs before dosing , 5 to 10 minutes after bolus dosing , following adjustments in the infusion rate , and at the end of the PCI procedure .
Obtain additional ACTs every 20 to 30 minutes during a prolonged procedure .
Continued Anticoagulation after PCI : If a patient requires anticoagulation after the procedure , Argatroban Injection may be continued , but at a rate of 2 mcg / kg / min and adjusted as needed to maintain the aPTT in the desired range .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 3 Dosing in Patients With Hepatic Impairment For adult patients with HIT and moderate or severe hepatic impairment ( based on Child - Pugh classification ) , an initial dose of 0 . 5 mcg / kg / min is recommended , based on the approximately 4 - fold decrease in argatroban clearance relative to those with normal hepatic function .
Monitor the aPTT closely , and adjust the dosage as clinically indicated .
Monitoring Therapy : Achievement of steady state aPTT levels may take longer and require more dose adjustments in patients with hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function .
For patients with hepatic impairment undergoing PCI and who have HIT or are at risk for HIT , carefully titrate argatroban until the desired level of anticoagulation is achieved .
Use of Argatroban in PCI patients with clinically significant hepatic disease or AST / ALT levels ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal should be avoided [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
2 . 4 Dosing in Pediatric Patients With Heparin - Induced Thrombocytopenia / Heparin - Induced Thrombocytopenia and Thrombosis Syndrome Initial Dosage : Initial argatroban infusion doses are lower for seriously ill pediatric patients compared to adults with normal hepatic function [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Monitoring Therapy : In general , therapy with argatroban is monitored using the aPTT .
Tests of anticoagulant effects ( including the aPTT ) typically attain steady - state levels within one to three hours following initiation of argatroban in patients without hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Dose adjustment may be required to attain the target aPTT .
Check the aPTT two hours after initiation of therapy and after any dose change to confirm that the patient has attained the desired therapeutic range .
Dosage Adjustment : [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] 2 . 5 Conversion to Oral Anticoagulant Therapy Initiating Oral Anticoagulant Therapy : When converting patients from Argatroban to oral anticoagulant therapy , consider the potential for combined effects on International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) .
To avoid prothrombotic effects and to ensure continuous anticoagulation when initiating warfarin , overlap Argatroban Injection and warfarin therapy .
There are insufficient data available to recommend the duration of the overlap .
Initiate therapy using the expected daily dose of warfarin .
A loading dose of warfarin should not be used .
The relationship between INR and bleeding risk is altered when argatroban and warfarin are co - administered .
The combination of argatroban and warfarin does not cause further reduction in the vitamin K – dependent factor Xa activity than that which is seen with warfarin alone .
The relationship between INR obtained on combined therapy and INR obtained on warfarin alone is dependent on both the dose of argatroban and the thromboplastin reagent used .
The INR value on warfarin alone ( INRW ) can be calculated from the INR value on combination argatroban and warfarin therapy [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Co - Administration of Warfarin and Argatroban Injection at Doses Up to 2 mcg / kg / min : Measure INR daily while Argatroban Injection and warfarin are co - administered .
In general , with doses of Argatroban Injection up to 2 mcg / kg / min , Argatroban Injection can be discontinued when the INR is > 4 on combined therapy .
After Argatroban Injection is discontinued , repeat the INR measurement in 4 to 6 hours .
If the repeat INR is below the desired therapeutic range , resume the infusion of Argatroban Injection and repeat the procedure daily until the desired therapeutic range on warfarin alone is reached .
Co - Administration of Warfarin and Argatroban Injection at Doses Greater than 2 mcg / kg / min : For doses greater than 2 mcg / kg / min , the relationship of INR between warfarin alone to the INR on warfarin plus argatroban is less predictable .
In this case , in order to predict the INR on warfarin alone , temporarily reduce the dose of Argatroban Injection to a dose of 2 mcg / kg / min .
Repeat the INR on Argatroban Injection and warfarin 4 to 6 hours after reduction of the Argatroban Injection dose and follow the process outlined above for administering Argatroban Injection at doses up to 2 mcg / kg / min .
3 DOSAGE FORMS & STRENGTHS Argatroban Injection is supplied in a single use vial containing 125 mg argatroban in 125 mL aqueous sodium chloride solution ( 1 mg / mL ) .
The solution is ready for intravenous infusion .
Argatroban Injection is supplied as a single use vial containing 125 mg argatroban in 125 mL aqueous sodium chloride solution ( 1 mg / mL ) ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Argatroban is contraindicated in : • Patients with major bleeding , • Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to argatroban .
Airway , skin , and generalized hypersensitivity reactions have been reported [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 4 ) ] .
• Major bleeding ( 4 ) • History of hypersensitivity to this product ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Risk of hemorrhage : Hemorrhage at any site can occur ( unexplained fall in hematocrit or blood pressure or other unexplained symptom may indicate hemorrhage ) .
Use with caution in patients at risk , including those receiving antiplatelet agents , thrombolytics , or other anticoagulants ( 5 . 1 ) • Use in hepatic impairment : Adjust starting dose and titrate carefully in patients with HIT who have moderate or severe hepatic impairment .
Avoid use in PCI in patients with clinically significant hepatic impairment ( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Risk of Hemorrhage Hemorrhage can occur at any site in the body in patients receiving argatroban .
An unexplained fall in hematocrit or hemoglobin or a fall in blood pressure should lead to consideration of a hemorrhagic event .
Argatroban Injection should be used with extreme caution in disease states and other circumstances in which there is an increased danger of hemorrhage .
These include severe hypertension ; immediately following lumbar puncture ; spinal anesthesia ; major surgery , especially involving the brain , spinal cord , or eye ; hematologic conditions associated with increased bleeding tendencies such as congenital or acquired bleeding disorders and gastrointestinal lesions such as ulcerations .
Concomitant use of argatroban with antiplatelet agents , thrombolytics , and other anticoagulants may increase the risk of bleeding .
5 . 2 Use in Hepatic Impairment Use caution when administering argatroban to patients with hepatic impairment by starting with a lower dose and carefully titrating until the desired level of anticoagulation is achieved .
Upon cessation of argatroban infusion in the hepatically impaired patient , full reversal of anticoagulant effects may require longer than 4 hours due to decreased clearance and increased elimination half - life of argatroban [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Use of argatroban in PCI patients with clinically significant hepatic disease or AST / ALT levels ≥ 3 times the upper limit of normal should be avoided .
5 . 3 Laboratory Tests Anticoagulation effects associated with argatroban infusion at doses up to 40 mcg / kg / min correlate with increases of the activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) .
Although other global clot - based tests including prothrombin time ( PT ) , the International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) , and thrombin time ( TT ) are affected by argatroban , the therapeutic ranges for these tests have not been identified for argatroban therapy .
In clinical trials in PCI , the activated clotting time ( ACT ) was used for monitoring argatroban anticoagulant activity during the procedure .
The concomitant use of argatroban and warfarin results in prolongation of the PT and INR beyond that produced by warfarin alone [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse event rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
• HIT patients : The most common ( > 5 % ) adverse reactions were dyspnea , hypotension , fever , diarrhea , sepsis , and cardiac arrest ( 6 . 1 ) • PCI patients : The most common ( > 5 % ) adverse reactions were chest pain , hypotension , back pain , nausea , vomiting and headache ( 6 . 2 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Gland Pharma at 864 - 879 - 9994 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch for voluntary reporting of adverse reactions .
6 . 1 Adverse Events in Patients with HIT ( With or Without Thrombosis ) The following safety information is based on all 568 patients treated with argatroban in Study 1 and Study 2 .
The safety profile of the patients from these studies is compared with that of 193 historical controls in which the adverse events were collected retrospectively .
Adverse events are separated into hemorrhagic and non - hemorrhagic events .
Major bleeding was defined as bleeding that was overt and associated with a hemoglobin decrease ≥ 2 g / dL , that led to a transfusion of ≥ 2 units , or that was intracranial , retroperitoneal , or into a major prosthetic joint .
Minor bleeding was overt bleeding that did not meet the criteria for major bleeding .
Table 4 gives an overview of the most frequently observed hemorrhagic events , presented separately by major and minor bleeding , sorted by decreasing occurrence among argatroban - treated patients with HIT ( with or without thrombosis ) .

Adverse events are separated into hemorrhagic ( Table 6 ) and non - hemorrhagic ( Table7 ) events .
Major bleeding was defined as bleeding that was overt and associated with a hemoglobin decrease ≥ 5 g / dL , that led to a transfusion of ≥ 2 units , or that was intracranial , retroperitoneal , or into a major prosthetic joint .
The rate of major bleeding events in patients treated with argatroban in the PCI trials was 1 . 8 % .

2 91 patients underwent 112 procedures .
Some patients may have experienced more than 1 event .
6 . 3 Intracranial Bleeding in Other Populations Increased risks for intracranial bleeding have been observed in investigational studies of argatroban for other uses .
In a study of patients with acute myocardial infarction receiving both argatroban and thrombolytic therapy ( streptokinase or tissue plasminogen activator ) , the overall frequency of intracranial bleeding was 1 % ( 8 out of 810 patients ) .
Intracranial bleeding was not observed in 317 subjects or patients who did not receive concomitant thrombolysis [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of argatroban for cardiac indications other than PCI in patients with HIT have not been established .
Intracranial bleeding was also observed in a prospective , placebo - controlled study of argatroban in patients who had onset of acute stroke within 12 hours of study entry .
Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was reported in 5 of 117 patients ( 4 . 3 % ) who received argatroban at 1 to 3 mcg / kg / min and in none of the 54 patients who received placebo .
Asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 5 ( 4 . 3 % ) and 2 ( 3 . 7 % ) of the patients , respectively .
6 . 4 Allergic Reactions One hundred fifty - six allergic reactions or suspected allergic reactions were observed in 1 , 127 individuals who were treated with argatroban in clinical pharmacology studies or for various clinical indications .
About 95 % ( 148 / 156 ) of these reactions occurred in patients who concomitantly received thrombolytic therapy ( e . g . , streptokinase ) or contrast media .
Allergic reactions or suspected allergic reactions in populations other than patients with HIT ( with or without thrombosis ) include ( in descending order of frequency ) : • Airway reactions ( coughing , dyspnea ) : 10 % or more • Skin reactions ( rash , bullous eruption ) : 1 to < 10 % • General reactions ( vasodilation ) : 1 to 10 % Limited data are available on the potential formation of drug - related antibodies .
Plasma from 12 healthy volunteers treated with argatroban over 6 days showed no evidence of neutralizing antibodies .
No loss of anticoagulant activity was noted with repeated administration of argatroban to more than 40 patients .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Heparin : Allow sufficient time for heparin ’ s effect on aPTT to decrease before initiating Argatroban Injection therapy ( 7 . 1 ) • Warfarin : Concomitant use results in increased prolongation of PT and INR ( 7 . 2 ) • Thrombolytic agents or glycoprotein IIb / IIIa antagonists : Safety and effectiveness of concomitant use with argatroban have not been established ( 7 . 4 , 7 . 5 ) 7 . 1 Heparin If argatroban is to be initiated after cessation of heparin therapy , allow sufficient time for heparin ’ s effect on the aPTT to decrease prior to initiation of argatroban therapy .
7 . 2 Oral Anticoagulant Agents Pharmacokinetic drug - drug interactions between argatroban and warfarin ( 7 . 5 mg single oral dose ) have not been demonstrated .
However , the concomitant use of argatroban and warfarin ( 5 to 7 . 5 mg initial oral dose , followed by 2 . 5 to 6 mg / day orally for 6 to 10 days ) results in prolongation of the prothrombin time ( PT ) and International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
7 . 3 Aspirin / Acetaminophen No drug - drug interactions have been demonstrated between argatroban and concomitantly administered aspirin or acetaminophen [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 4 Thrombolytic Agents The safety and effectiveness of argatroban with thrombolytic agents have not been established [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 5 Glycoprotein IIb / IIIa Antagonists The safety and effectiveness of argatroban with glycoprotein IIb / IIIa antagonists have not been established .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Nursing Mothers : Discontinue nursing or drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother ( 8 . 3 ) • Pediatric use : Safety and effectiveness have not been established ; if used initial infusion doses are lower than in adult patients ( 2 . 4 , 8 . 4 , 12 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of argatroban use in pregnant women .
Developmental studies performed in rats with argatroban at intravenous doses up to 27 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 3 times the maximum recommended human dose , based on body surface area ) and in rabbits at intravenous doses up to 10 . 8 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 2 times the maximum recommended human dose , based on body surface area ) have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus .
Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether argatroban is excreted in human milk .
Argatroban is detected in rat milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from argatroban , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of argatroban , including the appropriate anticoagulation goals and duration of therapy , have not been established among pediatric patients .
Argatroban was studied among 18 seriously ill pediatric patients who required an alternative to heparin anticoagulation .
Most patients were diagnosed with HIT or suspected HIT .
Age ranges of patients were < 6 months , n = 8 ; six months to < 8 years , n = 6 ; 8 to 16 years , n = 4 .
All patients had serious underlying conditions and were receiving multiple concomitant medications .
Thirteen patients received argatroban solely as a continuous infusion ( no bolus dose ) .
Dosing was initiated in the majority of these 13 patients at 1 mcg / kg / min .
Dosing was titrated as needed to achieve and maintain an aPTT of 1 . 5 to 3 times the baseline value .
Most patients required multiple dose adjustments to maintain anticoagulation parameters within the desired range .
During the 30 - day study period , thrombotic events occurred during argatroban administration to two patients and following argatroban discontinuation in three other patients .
Major bleeding occurred among two patients ; one patient experienced an intracranial hemorrhage after 4 days of argatroban therapy in the setting of sepsis and thrombocytopenia .
Another patient completed 14 days of argatroban treatment in the study , but experienced an intracranial hemorrhage while receiving argatroban following completion of the study treatment period .
When argatroban is used among seriously ill pediatric patients with HIT / HITTS who require an alternative to heparin and who have normal hepatic function , initiate a continuous infusion of argatroban at a dose of 0 . 75 mcg / kg / min .
Initiate the infusion at a dose of 0 . 2 mcg / kg / min among seriously ill pediatric patients with impaired hepatic function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Check the aPTT two hours after the initiation of the argatroban infusion and adjust the dose to achieve the target aPTT .
These dose recommendations are based upon a goal of aPTT prolongation of 1 . 5 to 3 times the baseline value and avoidance of an aPTT > 100 seconds .
Increments of 0 . 1 to 0 . 25 mcg / kg / min for pediatric patients with normal hepatic function and increments of 0 . 05 mcg / kg / min or lower for pediatric patients with impaired hepatic function may be considered but dose selection must take into account multiple factors including the current argatroban dose , the current aPTT , target aPTT , and the clinical status of the patient .
These dose recommendations are based upon a goal of aPTT prolongation of 1 . 5 to 3 times the baseline value and avoidance of an aPTT > 100 seconds .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects ( 1340 ) in clinical studies of argatroban , 35 % were 65 and over .
In the clinical studies of adult patients with HIT ( with or without thrombosis ) , the effectiveness of argatroban was not affected by age .
No trends were observed across age groups for both aPTT and the ACT .
The safety analysis did suggest that older patients tended to have an increased incidence of events compared to younger patients ; however , older patients had increased underlying conditions , which may predispose them to events .
The studies were not sized appropriately to detect differences in safety between age groups .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Dose reduction and careful titration are required when administering argatroban to patients with hepatic impairment .
Reversal of anticoagulation effect may be prolonged in this population [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive anticoagulation , with or without bleeding , may be controlled by discontinuing argatroban or by decreasing the argatroban dose .
In clinical studies , anticoagulation parameters generally returned from therapeutic levels to baseline within 2 to 4 hours after discontinuation of the drug .
Reversal of anticoagulant effect may take longer in patients with hepatic impairment .
No specific antidote to argatroban is available ; if life - threatening bleeding occurs and excessive plasma levels of argatroban are suspected , discontinue argatroban immediately and measure aPTT and other coagulation parameters .
When argatroban was administered as a continuous infusion ( 2 mcg / kg / min ) prior to and during a 4 - hour hemodialysis session , approximately 20 % of argatroban was cleared through dialysis .
Single intravenous doses of argatroban at 200 , 124 , 150 , and 200 mg / kg were lethal to mice , rats , rabbits , and dogs , respectively .
The symptoms of acute toxicity were loss of righting reflex , tremors , clonic convulsions , paralysis of hind limbs , and coma .
11 DESCRIPTION Argatroban is a synthetic direct thrombin inhibitor and the chemical name is 1 - [ 5 - [ ( aminoiminomethyl ) amino ] - 1 - oxo - 2 - [ [ ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 - tetrahydro - 3 - methyl - 8 - quinolinyl ) sulfonyl ] amino ] pentyl ] - 4 - methyl - 2 - piperidinecarboxylic acid , monohydrate .
Argatroban has 4 asymmetric carbons .
One of the asymmetric carbons has an R configuration ( stereoisomer Type I ) and an S configuration ( stereoisomer Type II ) .
Argatroban consists of a mixture of R and S stereoisomers at a ratio of approximately 65 : 35 .
The molecular formula of argatroban is C23H36N6O5S • H2O .
Its molecular weight is 526 . 66 g / mol .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Argatroban Injection is a sterile , non - pyrogenic , clear , colorless to pale yellow isotonic solution .
It is supplied in a single - use clear glass vial containing 125 mg of argatroban in 125 mL sodium chloride solution .
Each mL contains 1 mg argatroban , 9 mg sodium chloride , USP , 3 mg sorbitol , NF in water for injection , USP .
The pH of the solution is between 3 . 2 to 7 . 5 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor that reversibly binds to the thrombin active site .
Argatroban does not require the co - factor antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity .
Argatroban exerts its anticoagulant effects by inhibiting thrombin - catalyzed or - induced reactions , including fibrin formation ; activation of coagulation factors V , VIII , and XIII ; activation of protein C ; and platelet aggregation .
Argatroban inhibits thrombin with an inhibition constant ( Ki ) of 0 . 04 µM .
At therapeutic concentrations , argatroban has little or no effect on related serine proteases ( trypsin , factor Xa , plasmin , and kallikrein ) .
Argatroban is capable of inhibiting the action of both free and clot - associated thrombin .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics When argatroban is administered by continuous infusion , anticoagulant effects and plasma concentrations of argatroban follow similar , predictable temporal response profiles , with low inter subject variability .
Immediately upon initiation of argatroban infusion , anticoagulant effects are produced as plasma argatroban concentrations begin to rise .
Steady - state levels of both drug and anticoagulant effect are typically attained within 1 to 3 hours and are maintained until the infusion is discontinued or the dosage adjusted .
Steady - state plasma argatroban concentrations increase proportionally with dose ( for infusion doses up to 40 mcg / kg / min in healthy subjects ) and are well correlated with steady - state anticoagulant effects .
For infusion doses up to 40 mcg / kg / min , argatroban increases in a dose - dependent fashion , the activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) , the activated clotting time ( ACT ) , the prothrombin time ( PT ) , the International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) , and the thrombin time ( TT ) in healthy volunteers and cardiac patients .
Representative steady - state plasma argatroban concentrations and anticoagulant effects are shown below for argatroban infusion doses up to 10 mcg / kg / min ( see Figure 1 ) .
Figure 1 .
Relationship at Steady State Between Argatroban Dose , Plasma Argatroban Concentration and Anticoagulant Effect [ MULTIMEDIA ] Effect on International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) : Because argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor , co - administration of argatroban and warfarin produces a combined effect on the laboratory measurement of the INR .
However , concurrent therapy , compared to warfarin monotherapy , exerts no additional effect on vitamin K – dependent factor Xa activity .
The relationship between INR on co - therapy and warfarin alone is dependent on both the dose of argatroban and the thromboplastin reagent used .
This relationship is influenced by the International Sensitivity Index ( ISI ) of the thromboplastin .
Data for 2 commonly utilized thromboplastins with ISI values of 0 . 88 ( Innovin , Dade ) and 1 . 78 ( Thromboplastin C Plus , Dade ) are presented in Figure 2 for an argatroban dose of 2 mcg / kg / min .
Thromboplastins with higher ISI values than shown result in higher INRs on combined therapy of warfarin and argatroban .
These data are based on results obtained in normal individuals [ see Dosage And Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Warnings And Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Figure 2 .
INR Relationship of Argatroban Plus Warfarin Versus Warfarin Alone [ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 2 demonstrates the relationship between INR for warfarin alone and INR for warfarin co - administered with argatroban at a dose of 2 mcg / kg / min .
To calculate INR for warfarin alone ( INRW ) , based on INR for co - therapy of warfarin and argatroban ( INRWA ) , when the argatroban dose is 2 mcg / kg / min , use the equation next to the appropriate curve .
Example : At a dose of 2 mcg / kg / min and an INR performed with Thromboplastin A , the equation 0 . 19 + 0 . 57 ( INRWA ) = INRW would allow a prediction of the INR on warfarin alone ( INRW ) .
Thus , using an INRWA value of 4 . 0 obtained on combined therapy : INRW = 0 . 19 + 0 . 57 ( 4 ) = 2 . 47 as the value for INR on warfarin alone .
The error ( confidence interval ) associated with a prediction is ± 0 . 4 units .
Similar linear relationships and prediction errors exist for argatroban at a dose of 1 mcg / kg / min .
Thus , for argatroban doses of 1 or 2 mcg / kg / min , INRW can be predicted from INRWA .
For argatroban doses greater than 2 mcg / kg / min , the error associated with predicting INRW from INRWA is ± 1 .
Thus , INRW cannot be reliably predicted from INRWA at doses greater than 2 mcg / kg / min .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution : Argatroban distributes mainly in the extra cellular fluid as evidenced by an apparent steady - state volume of distribution of 174 mL / kg ( 12 . 18 L in a 70 kg adult ) .
Argatroban is 54 % bound to human serum proteins , with binding to albumin and α1 - acid glycoprotein being 20 % and 34 % , respectively .
Metabolism : The main route of argatroban metabolism is hydroxylation and aromatization of the 3 - methyltetrahydroquinoline ring in the liver .
The formation of each of the 4 known metabolites is catalyzed in vitro by the human liver microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 / 5 .
The primary metabolite ( M1 ) exerts 3 - to 5 - fold weaker anticoagulant effects than argatroban .
Unchanged argatroban is the major component in plasma .
The plasma concentrations of M1 range between 0 % and 20 % of that of the parent drug .
The other metabolites ( M2 to M4 ) are found only in very low quantities in the urine and have not been detected in plasma or feces .
These data , together with the lack of effect of erythromycin ( a potent CYP3A4 / 5 inhibitor ) on argatroban pharmacokinetics , suggest that CYP3A4 / 5 - mediated metabolism is not an important elimination pathway in vivo .
Total body clearance is approximately 5 . 1 mL / kg / min ( 0 . 31 L / kg / hr ) for infusion doses up to 40 mcg / kg / min .
The terminal elimination half - life of argatroban ranges between 39 and 51 minutes . There is no interconversion of the 21 – ( R ) : 21 – ( S ) diastereoisomers .
The plasma ratio of these diastereoisomers is unchanged by metabolism or hepatic impairment , remaining constant at 65 : 35 ( ± 2 % ) .
Excretion : Argatroban is excreted primarily in the feces , presumably through biliary secretion .
In a study in which 14 C - argatroban ( 5 mcg / kg / min ) was infused for 4 hours into healthy subjects , approximately 65 % of the radioactivity was recovered in the feces within 6 days of the start of infusion with little or no radioactivity subsequently detected .
Approximately 22 % of the radioactivity appeared in the urine within 12 hours of the start of infusion .
Little or no additional urinary radioactivity was subsequently detected .
Average percent recovery of unchanged drug , relative to total dose , was 16 % in urine and at least 14 % in feces .
Special Populations : Hepatic Impairment : The dosage of argatroban should be decreased in patients with hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Patients with hepatic impairment were not studied in percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) trials .
At a dose of 2 . 5 mcg / kg / min , hepatic impairment is associated with decreased clearance and increased elimination half - life of argatroban ( to 1 . 9 mL / kg / min and 181 minutes , respectively , for patients with a Child - Pugh score > 6 ) .
Renal Impairment : No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal dysfunction .
The effect of renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of argatroban was studied in 6 subjects with normal renal function ( mean Clcr = 95 ± 16 mL / min ) and in 18 subjects with mild ( mean Clcr = 64 ± 10 mL / min ) , moderate ( mean Clcr = 41 ± 5 . 8 mL / min ) , and severe ( mean Clcr = 5 ± 7 mL / min ) renal impairment .
The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of argatroban at dosages up to 5 mcg / kg / min were not significantly affected by renal dysfunction .
Use of argatroban was evaluated in a study of 12 patients with stable end - stage renal disease undergoing chronic intermittent hemodialysis .
Argatroban was administered at a rate of 2 to 3 mcg / kg / min ( begun at least 4 hours prior to dialysis ) or as a bolus dose of 250 mcg / kg at the start of dialysis followed by a continuous infusion of 2 mcg / kg / min .
Although these regimens did not achieve the goal of maintaining ACT values at 1 . 8 times the baseline value throughout most of the hemodialysis period , the hemodialysis sessions were successfully completed with both of these regimens .
The mean ACTs produced in this study ranged from 1 . 39 to 1 . 82 times baseline , and the mean aPTTs ranged from 1 . 96 to 3 . 4 times baseline .
When argatroban was administered as a continuous infusion of 2 mcg / kg / min prior to and during a 4 - hour hemodialysis session , approximately 20 % was cleared through dialysis .
Age , Gender : There are no clinically significant effects of age or gender on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics ( e . g . , aPTT ) of argatroban in adults .
Pediatric : Argatroban clearance is decreased in seriously ill pediatric patients .
Pharmacokinetic parameters of argatroban were characterized in a population pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic analysis with sparse data from 15 seriously ill pediatric patients .
Clearance in pediatric patients ( 0 . 16 L / hr / kg ) was 50 % lower compared to healthy adults ( 0 . 31 L / hr / kg ) .
Four pediatric patients with elevated bilirubin ( secondary to cardiac complications or hepatic impairment ) had , on average , 80 % lower clearance ( 0 . 03 L / hr / kg ) when compared to pediatric patients with normal bilirubin levels .
[ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) . ]
Drug - Drug Interactions : Digoxin : In 12 healthy volunteers , intravenous infusion of argatroban ( 2 mcg / kg / min ) over 5 days ( study days 11 to 15 ) did not affect the steady - state pharmacokinetics of oral digoxin ( 0 . 375 mg daily for 15 days ) .
Erythromycin : In 10 healthy subjects , orally administered erythromycin ( a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 / 5 ) at 500 mg four times daily for 7 days had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of argatroban at a dose of 1 mcg / kg / min for 5 hours .
These data suggest oxidative metabolism by CYP3A4 / 5 is not an important elimination pathway in vivo for argatroban .
Aspirin and Acetaminophen : Drug - drug interactions have not been demonstrated between argatroban and concomitantly administered aspirin ( 162 . 5 mg orally given 26 and 2 hours prior to initiation of argatroban 1 mcg / kg / min over 4 hours ) or acetaminophen ( 1 , 000 mg orally given 12 , 6 , and 0 hours prior to , and 6 and 12 hours subsequent to , initiation of argatroban 1 . 5 mcg / kg / min over 18 hours ) .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with argatroban have not been performed .
Argatroban was not genotoxic in the Ames test , the Chinese hamster ovary cell ( CHO / HGPRT ) forward mutation test , the Chinese hamster lung fibroblast chromosome aberration test , the rat hepatocyte , and WI - 38 human fetal lung cell unscheduled DNA synthesis ( UDS ) tests , or the mouse micronucleus test .
Argatroban at intravenous doses up to 27 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 3 times the recommended maximum human dose based on body surface area ) had no effect on fertility and reproductive function of male and female rats .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Heparin - Induced Thrombocytopenia The safety and efficacy of argatroban were evaluated in an historically controlled efficacy and safety study ( Study 1 ) and a follow - on efficacy and safety study ( Study 2 ) .
These studies were comparable with regard to study design , study objectives , dosing regimens as well as study outline , conduct , and monitoring .
In these studies , 568 adult patients were treated with argatroban and 193 adult patients made up the historical control group .
Patients had a clinical diagnosis of heparin - induced thrombocytopenia , either without thrombosis ( HIT ) or with thrombosis ( HITTS [ heparin - induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome ] ) and were males or non - pregnant females between the age of 18 and 80 years old .
HIT / HITTS was defined by a fall in platelet count to less than 100 , 000 / µL or a 50 % decrease in platelets after the initiation of heparin therapy with no apparent explanation other than HIT .
Patients with HITTS also had an arterial or venous thrombosis documented by appropriate imaging techniques or supported by clinical evidence such as acute myocardial infarction , stroke , pulmonary embolism , or other clinical indications of vascular occlusion .
Patients who had documented histories of positive heparin - dependent antibody tests without current thrombocytopenia or heparin challenge ( e . g . , patients with latent disease ) were also included if they required anticoagulation .
These studies did not include patients with documented unexplained aPTT > 200 % of control at baseline , documented coagulation disorder or bleeding diathesis unrelated to HIT , a lumbar puncture within the past 7 days or a history of previous aneurysm , hemorrhagic stroke , or a thrombotic stroke within the past 6 months unrelated to HIT .
The initial dose of argatroban was 2 mcg / kg / min .
Two hours after the start of the argatroban infusion , an aPTT level was obtained and dose adjustments were made ( up to a maximum of 10 mcg / kg / min ) to achieve a steady - state aPTT value that was 1 . 5 to 3 . 0 times the baseline value , not to exceed 100 seconds .
Overall the mean aPTT level for HIT and HITTS patients during the Argatroban infusion increased from baseline values of 34 and 38 seconds , respectively , to 62 . 5 and 64 . 5 seconds , respectively .
The primary efficacy analysis was based on a comparison of event rates for a composite endpoint that included death ( all causes ) , amputation ( all causes ) or new thrombosis during the treatment and follow - up period ( study days 0 to 37 ) .
Secondary analyses included evaluation of the event rates for the components of the composite endpoint as well as time - to - event analyses .
In Study 1 , a total of 304 patients were enrolled as follows : active HIT ( n = 129 ) , active HITTS ( n = 144 ) , or latent disease ( n = 31 ) .
Among the 193 historical controls , 139 ( 72 % ) had active HIT , 46 ( 24 % ) had active HITTS , and 8 ( 4 % ) had latent disease .
Within each group , those with active HIT and those with latent disease were analyzed together .
Positive laboratory confirmation of HIT / HITTS by the heparin - induced platelet aggregation test or serotonin release assay was demonstrated in 174 of 304 ( 57 % ) argatroban - treated patients ( i . e . , in 80 with HIT or latent disease and 94 with HITTS ) and in 149 of 193 ( 77 % ) historical controls ( i . e . , in 119 with HIT or latent disease and 30 with HITTS ) .
The test results for the remainder of the patients and controls were either negative or not determined .
There was a significant improvement in the composite outcome in patients with HIT and HITTS treated with argatroban versus those in the historical control group ( see Table 9 ) .
The components of the composite endpoint are shown in Table 9 .

Time - to - event analyses showed significant improvements in the time - to - first event in patients with HIT or HITTS treated with argatroban versus those in the historical control group .
The between - group differences in the proportion of patients who remained free of death , amputation , or new thrombosis were statistically significant in favor of argatroban by these analyses .

Time - to - First Event for the Composite Efficacy Endpoint : [ MULTIMEDIA ] In Study 2 , a total of 264 patients were enrolled as follows : HIT ( n = 125 ) or HITTS ( n = 139 ) .
There was a significant improvement in the composite efficacy outcome for argatroban - treated patients , versus the same historical control group from Study 1 , among patients having HIT ( 25 . 6 % vs . 38 . 8 % ) , patients having HITTS ( 41 . 0 % vs . 56 . 5 % ) , and patients having either HIT or HITTS ( 33 . 7 % vs . 43 . 0 % ) .
Time - to - event analyses showed significant improvements in the time - to - first event in patients with HIT or HITTS treated with argatroban versus those in the historical control group .
The between - group differences in the proportion of patients who remained free of death , amputation , or new thrombosis were statistically significant in favor of argatroban .
Anticoagulant Effect : In Study 1 , the mean ( ± SE ) dose of argatroban administered was 2 . 0 ± 0 . 1 mcg / kg / min in the HIT arm and 1 . 9 ± 0 . 1 mcg / kg / min in the HITTS arm .
Seventy - six percent of patients with HIT and 81 % of patients with HITTS achieved a target aPTT at least 1 . 5 - fold greater than the baseline aPTT at the first assessment occurring on average at 4 . 6 hours ( HIT ) and 3 . 9 hours ( HITTS ) following initiation of argatroban therapy .
No enhancement of aPTT response was observed in subjects receiving repeated administration of argatroban .
Platelet Count Recovery : In Study 1 , 53 % of patients with HIT and 58 % of patients with HITTS , had a recovery of platelet count by Day 3 .
Platelet Count Recovery was defined as an increase in platelet count to > 100 , 000 / µL or to at least 1 . 5 - fold greater than the baseline count ( platelet count at study initiation ) by Day 3 of the study .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) Patients with or at Risk for HIT In 3 similarly designed trials , argatroban was administered to 91 patients with current or previous clinical diagnosis of HIT or heparin - dependent antibodies , who underwent a total of 112 percutaneous coronary interventions ( PCIs ) including percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) , coronary stent placement , or atherectomy .
Among the 91 patients undergoing their first PCI with argatroban , notable ongoing or recent medical history included myocardial infarction ( n = 35 ) , unstable angina ( n = 23 ) , and chronic angina ( n = 34 ) .
There were 33 females and 58 males .
The average age was 67 . 6 years ( median 70 . 7 , range 44 to 86 ) , and the average weight was 82 . 5 kg ( median 81 . 0 kg , range 49 to 141 ) .
Twenty - one of the 91 patients had a repeat PCI using argatroban an average of 150 days after their initial PCI .
Seven of 91 patients received glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitors .
Safety and efficacy were assessed against historical control populations who had been anticoagulated with heparin .
All patients received oral aspirin ( 325 mg ) 2 to 24 hours prior to the interventional procedure .
After venous or arterial sheaths were in place , anticoagulation was initiated with a bolus of argatroban of 350 mcg / kg via a large - bore intravenous line or through the venous sheath over 3 to 5 minutes .
Simultaneously , a maintenance infusion of 25 mcg / kg / min was initiated to achieve a therapeutic activated clotting time ( ACT ) of 300 to 450 seconds .
If necessary to achieve this therapeutic range , the maintenance infusion dose was titrated ( 15 to 40 mcg / kg / min ) and / or an additional bolus dose of 150 mcg / kg could be given .
Each patient ’ s ACT was checked 5 to 10 minutes following the bolus dose .
The ACT was checked as clinically indicated .
Arterial and venous sheaths were removed no sooner than 2 hours after discontinuation of argatroban and when the ACT was less than 160 seconds .
If a patient required anticoagulation after the procedure , argatroban could be continued , but at a lower infusion dose between 2 . 5 and 5 mcg / kg / min .
An aPTT was drawn 2 hours after this dose reduction and the dose of argatroban then was adjusted as clinically indicated ( not to exceed 10 mcg / kg / min ) , to reach an aPTT between 1 . 5 and 3 times baseline value ( not to exceed 100 seconds ) .
In 92 of the 112 interventions ( 82 % ) , the patient received the initial bolus of 350 mcg / kg and an initial infusion dose of 25 mcg / kg / min .
The majority of patients did not require additional bolus dosing during the PCI procedure .
The mean value for the initial ACT measurement after the start of dosing for all interventions was 379 sec ( median 338 sec ; 5 th percentile - 95 th percentile 238 to 675 sec ) .
The mean ACT value per intervention over all measurements taken during the procedure was 416 sec ( median 390 sec ; 5 th percentile - 95 th percentile 261 to 698 sec ) .
About 65 % of patients had ACTs within the recommended range of 300 to 450 seconds throughout the procedure .
The investigators did not achieve anticoagulation within the recommended range in about 23 % of patients .
However , in this small sample , patients with ACTs below 300 seconds did not have more coronary thrombotic events , and patients with ACTs over 450 seconds did not have higher bleeding rates .
Acute procedural success was defined as lack of death , emergent coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) , or Q - wave myocardial infarction .
Acute procedural success was reported in 98 . 2 % of patients who underwent PCIs with argatroban anticoagulation compared with 94 . 3 % of historical control patients anticoagulated with heparin ( p = NS ) .
Among the 112 interventions , 2 patients had emergency CABGs , 3 had repeat PTCAs , 4 had non - Q - wave myocardial infarctions , 3 had myocardial ischemia , 1 had an abrupt closure , and 1 had an impending closure ( some patients may have experienced more than 1 event ) .
No patients died .
