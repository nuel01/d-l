For Intravenous Use WARNING Protamine sulfate can cause severe hypotension , cardiovascular collapse , noncardiogenic pulmonary edema , catastrophic pulmonary vasoconstriction , and pulmonary hypertension .
Risk factors include high dose or overdose , rapid administration ( see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) , repeated doses , previous administration of protamine , and current or previous use of protamine - containing drugs ( NPH insulin , protamine zinc insulin , and certain beta - blockers ) .
Allergy to fish , previous vasectomy , and severe left ventricular dysfunction and abnormal preoperative pulmonary hemodynamics also may be risk factors .
In patients with any of these risk factors , the risk to benefit of administration of protamine sulfate should be carefully considered .
Vasopressors and resuscitation equipment should be immediately available in case of a severe reaction to protamine .
Protamine sulfate should not be given when bleeding occurs without prior heparin use .
DESCRIPTION : Protamines are simple proteins of low molecular weight that are rich in arginine and strongly basic .
They occur in the sperm of salmon and certain other species of fish .
Protamine sulfate occurs as fine white or off - white amorphous or crystalline powder .
It is sparingly soluble in water .
The pH is between 6 . 0 and 7 . 0 .
The cationic hydrogenated protamine at a pH of 6 . 8 to 7 . 1 reacts with anionic heparin at a pH of 5 . 0 to 7 . 5 to form an inactive complex .
Protamine Sulfate Injection , USP is a sterile , isotonic solution of protamine sulfate .
It acts as a heparin antagonist .
It is also a weak anticoagulant .
Each mL contains : Protamine sulfate 10 mg ; sodium chloride 9 mg ; Water for Injection q . s . Sulfuric acid and / or dibasic sodium phosphate ( heptahydrate ) may have been added for pH adjustment .
The preparation is preservative free .
Protamine sulfate is administered intravenously .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : When administered alone , protamine has an anticoagulant effect .
However , when it is given in the presence of heparin ( which is strongly acidic ) , a stable salt is formed and the anticoagulant activity of both drugs is lost .
Protamine sulfate has a rapid onset of action .
Neutralization of heparin occurs within five minutes after intravenous administration of an appropriate dose of protamine sulfate .
Although the metabolic fate of the heparin - protamine complex has not been elucidated , it has been postulated that protamine sulfate in the heparin - protamine complex may be partially metabolized or may be attacked by fibrinolysin , thus freeing heparin .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE : Protamine Sulfate Injection , USP is indicated in the treatment of heparin overdosage .
CONTRAINDICATIONS : Protamine sulfate is contraindicated in patients who have shown previous intolerance to the drug .
WARNINGS : Hyperheparinemia or bleeding has been reported in experimental animals and in some patients 30 minutes to 18 hours after cardiac surgery ( under cardiopulmonary bypass ) in spite of complete neutralization of heparin by adequate doses of protamine sulfate at the end of the operation .
It is important to keep the patient under close observation after cardiac surgery .
Additional doses of protamine sulfate should be administered if indicated by coagulation studies , such as the heparin titration test with protamine and the determination of plasma thrombin time .
Too - rapid administration of protamine sulfate can cause severe hypotensive and anaphylactoid reactions ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and WARNINGS ) .
Facilities to treat shock should be available .
PRECAUTIONS : General Because of the anticoagulant effect of protamine , it is unwise to give more than 50 mg over a short period unless a larger dose is clearly needed .
Patients with a history of allergy to fish may develop hypersensitivity reactions to protamine , although to date no relationship has been established between allergic reactions to protamine and fish allergy .
Previous exposure to protamine can induce a humoral immune response and predispose susceptible individuals to the development of untoward reactions from the subsequent use of this drug .
Patients exposed to protamine through the use of protamine - containing insulin or during heparin neutralization may experience life - threatening reactions and fatal anaphylaxis upon receiving large doses of protamine intravenously .
Severe reactions to intravenous protamine can occur in the absence of local or systemic allergic reactions to subcutaneous injection of protamine - containing insulin .
Reports of the presence of antiprotamine antibodies in the sera of infertile or vasectomized men suggest that some of these individuals may react to the use of protamine sulfate .
Fatal anaphylaxis has been reported in one patient with no prior history of allergies .
Drug Interactions Protamine sulfate has been shown to be incompatible with certain antibiotics , including several of the cephalosporins and penicillins ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Studies have not been performed to determine potential for carcinogenicity , mutagenicity or impairment of fertility .
Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with protamine sulfate .
It is also not known whether protamine sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Protamine sulfate should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when protamine sulfate is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established .
ADVERSE REACTIONS : The intravenous administration of protamine sulfate may cause a sudden fall in blood pressure and bradycardia .
Other reactions include transitory flushing and feeling of warmth , dyspnea , nausea , vomiting and lassitude .
Back pain has been reported in conscious patients undergoing such procedures as cardiac catheterization .
Severe adverse reactions have been reported including : ( 1 ) Anaphylaxis that resulted in severe respiratory distress , circulation collapse and capillary leak ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
Fatal anaphylaxis has been reported in one patient with no prior history of allergies ; ( 2 ) Anaphylactoid reactions with circulatory collapse , capillary leak , and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema ; acute pulmonary hypertension .
Complement activation by the heparin - protamine complexes , release of lysosomal enzymes from neutrophils , and prostaglandin and thomboxane generation have been associated with the development of anaphylactoid reactions .
Severe and potentially irreversible circulatory collapse associated with myocardial failure and reduced cardiac output can also occur .
The mechanism ( s ) of this reaction and the role played by concurrent factors are unclear .
High - protein , noncardiogenic pulmonary edema associated with the use of protamine has been reported in patients on cardiopulmonary bypass who are undergoing cardiovascular surgery .
The etiologic role of protamine in the pathogenesis of this condition is uncertain , and multiple factors have been present in most cases .
The condition has been reported in association with administration of certain blood products , other drugs , cardiopulmonary bypass alone , and other etiologic factors .
It is difficult to treat , and it can be life - threatening .
Because fatal anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported after the administration of protamine sulfate , the drug should be given only when resuscitation techniques and treatment of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid shock are readily available .
OVERDOSAGE : Signs and Symptoms Overdose of protamine sulfate may cause bleeding .
Protamine has a weak anticoagulant effect due to an interaction with platelets and with many proteins including fibrinogen .
This effect should be distinguished from the rebound anticoagulation that may occur 30 minutes to 18 hours following the reversal of heparin with protamine .
Rapid administration of protamine is more likely to result in bradycardia , dyspnea , a sensation of warmth , flushing , and severe hypotension .
Hypertension has also occurred .
The median lethal dose of protamine sulfate is 50 mg / kg in mice .
Serum concentrations of protamine sulfate are not clinically useful .
Information is not available on the amount of drug in a single dose that is associated with overdosage or is likely to be life - threatening .
Treatment To obtain up - to - date information about the treatment of overdose , a good resource is your certified Regional Poison Control Center .
Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians ' Desk Reference ( PDR ) .
In managing overdosage , consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses , interaction among drugs and unusual drug kinetics in your patient .
Replace blood loss with blood transfusions or fresh frozen plasma .
If the patient is hypotensive , consider fluids , epinephrine , dobutamine or dopamine .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : Each mg of protamine sulfate , calculated on the dried basis , neutralizes not less than 100 USP Heparin Units .
Protamine sulfate injection should be given by very slow intravenous injection over a 10 - minute period in doses not to exceed 50 mg ( see WARNINGS ) .
Protamine sulfate is intended for injection without further dilution ; however , if further dilution is desired , D5 - W or normal saline may be used .
Diluted solutions should not be stored since they contain no preservative .
Protamine sulfate should not be mixed with other drugs without knowledge of their compatibility , because protamine sulfate has been shown to be incompatible with certain antibiotics , including several of the cephalosporins and penicillins .
Because heparin disappears rapidly from the circulation , the dose of protamine sulfate required also decreases rapidly with the time elapsed following intravenous injection of heparin .
For example , if the protamine sulfate is administered 30 minutes after the heparin , one - half the usual dose may be sufficient .
The dosage of protamine sulfate should be guided by blood coagulation studies ( see WARNINGS ) .
Parenteral drug products should be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
