( 5 . 8 ) 5 . 1 Never Share an Insulin Lispro Injection Prefilled Pen or Syringe Between Patients Insulin Lispro Injection prefilled pens must never be shared between patients , even if the needle is changed .
Patients using Insulin Lispro Injection vials must never share needles or syringes with another person .
Sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood - borne pathogens .
5 . 2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in an insulin regimen ( e . g . , insulin strength , manufacturer , type , injection site or method of administration ) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] or hyperglycemia .
Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia ; and a sudden change in the injection site ( to an unaffected area ) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Make any changes to a patient ' s insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring .
Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia .
For patients with type 2 diabetes , dosage adjustments of concomitant antidiabetic products may be needed .
5 . 3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulins , including Insulin Lispro Injection .
Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures , may be life - threatening , or cause death .
Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time ; this may place an individual and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important ( e . g . , driving or operating other machinery ) .
Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly and symptoms may differ in each individual and change over time in the same individual .
Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes , in patients with diabetic nerve disease , in patients using medications that block the sympathetic nervous system ( e . g . , beta - blockers ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] , or in patients who experience recurrent hypoglycemia .
Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia after an injection is related to the duration of action of the insulin and , in general , is highest when the glucose lowering effect of the insulin is maximal .
As with all insulin preparations , the glucose lowering effect time course of Insulin Lispro Injection may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and depends on many conditions , including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern ( e . g . , macronutrient content or timing of meals ) , changes in level of physical activity , or changes to co - administered medication [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 , 8 . 7 ) ] .
Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia .
Self - monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia .
In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia , increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended .
5 . 4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix - ups between basal insulin products and other insulins , particularly rapid - acting insulins , have been reported .
To avoid medication errors between Insulin Lispro Injection and other insulins , instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection .
5 . 5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe , life - threatening , generalized allergy , including anaphylaxis , can occur with insulin products , including Insulin Lispro Injection .
If hypersensitivity reactions occur , discontinue Insulin Lispro Injection ; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Insulin Lispro Injection is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to Insulin Lispro Injection or any of its excipients [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
5 . 6 Hypokalemia All insulin products , including Insulin Lispro Injection , cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space , possibly leading to hypokalemia .
Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis , ventricular arrhythmia , and death .
Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia if indicated ( e . g . , patients using potassium - lowering medications , patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations ) .
5 . 7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR - gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) , which are peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor ( PPAR ) - gamma agonists , can cause dose - related fluid retention , particularly when used in combination with insulin .
Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure .
Patients treated with insulin , including Insulin Lispro Injection , and a PPAR - gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure .
If heart failure develops , it should be managed according to current standards of care , and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR - gamma agonist must be considered .
5 . 8 Hyperglycemia and Ketoacidosis Due to Insulin Pump Device Malfunction Malfunction of the insulin pump or insulin infusion set or insulin degradation can rapidly lead to hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis .
Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis is necessary .
Interim subcutaneous injections with Insulin Lispro Injection may be required .
Patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy must be trained to administer insulin by injection and have alternate insulin therapy available in case of pump failure [ see How Supplied / Storage and Handling ( 16 . 2 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere : • Hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
• Hypokalemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
Adverse reactions associated with Insulin Lispro Injection include hypoglycemia , allergic reactions , injection site reactions , lipodystrophy , pruritus , and rash .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1 - 800 - LillyRx ( 1 - 800 - 545 - 5979 ) or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying designs , the adverse reaction rates reported in one clinical trial may not be easily compared with those rates reported in another clinical trial , and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice .
The frequencies of Treatment - Emergent Adverse Events during Insulin Lispro Injection clinical trials in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in the tables below .
Table 1 : Treatment - Emergent Adverse Events in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( adverse events with frequency ≥ 5 % ) Events , n ( % ) Insulin Lispro Injection ( n = 81 ) Regular human insulin ( n = 86 ) Flu syndrome 28 ( 34 . 6 ) 28 ( 32 . 6 ) Pharyngitis 27 ( 33 . 3 ) 29 ( 33 . 7 ) Rhinitis 20 ( 24 . 7 ) 25 ( 29 . 1 ) Headache 24 ( 29 . 6 ) 19 ( 22 . 1 ) Pain 16 ( 19 . 8 ) 14 ( 16 . 3 ) Cough increased 14 ( 17 . 3 ) 15 ( 17 . 4 ) Infection 11 ( 13 . 6 ) 18 ( 20 . 9 ) Nausea 5 ( 6 . 2 ) 13 ( 15 . 1 ) Accidental injury 7 ( 8 . 6 ) 10 ( 11 . 6 ) Surgical procedure 5 ( 6 . 2 ) 12 ( 14 . 0 ) Fever 5 ( 6 . 2 ) 10 ( 11 . 6 ) Abdominal pain 6 ( 7 . 4 ) 7 ( 8 . 1 ) Asthenia 6 ( 7 . 4 ) 7 ( 8 . 1 ) Bronchitis 6 ( 7 . 4 ) 6 ( 7 . 0 ) Diarrhea 7 ( 8 . 6 ) 5 ( 5 . 8 ) Dysmenorrhea 5 ( 6 . 2 ) 6 ( 7 . 0 ) Myalgia 6 ( 7 . 4 ) 5 ( 5 . 8 ) Urinary tract infection 5 ( 6 . 2 ) 4 ( 4 . 7 ) Table 2 : Treatment - Emergent Adverse Events in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( adverse events with frequency ≥ 5 % ) Events , n ( % ) Insulin Lispro Injection ( n = 714 ) Regular human insulin ( n = 709 ) Headache 83 ( 11 . 6 ) 66 ( 9 . 3 ) Pain 77 ( 10 . 8 ) 71 ( 10 . 0 ) Infection 72 ( 10 . 1 ) 54 ( 7 . 6 ) Pharyngitis 47 ( 6 . 6 ) 58 ( 8 . 2 ) Rhinitis 58 ( 8 . 1 ) 47 ( 6 . 6 ) Flu syndrome 44 ( 6 . 2 ) 58 ( 8 . 2 ) Surgical procedure 53 ( 7 . 4 ) 48 ( 6 . 8 ) Insulin initiation and intensification of glucose control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory , reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder , worsening of diabetic retinopathy , and acute painful peripheral neuropathy .
However , long - term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy .
Lipodystrophy Long - term use of insulin , including Insulin Lispro Injection , can cause lipodystrophy at the site of repeated insulin injections or infusion .
Lipodystrophy includes lipohypertrophy ( thickening of adipose tissue ) and lipoatrophy ( thinning of adipose tissue ) , and may affect insulin absorption .
Rotate insulin injection or infusion sites within the same region to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Weight gain Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy , including Insulin Lispro Injection , and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria .
Peripheral Edema Insulin , including Insulin Lispro Injection , may cause sodium retention and edema , particularly if previously poor metabolic control is improved by intensified insulin therapy .
Adverse Reactions with Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion ( CSII ) In a 12 - week , randomized , crossover study in adult patients with type 1 diabetes ( n = 39 ) , the rates of catheter occlusions and infusion site reactions were similar for Insulin Lispro Injection and regular human insulin treated patients ( see Table 3 ) .
Table 3 : Catheter Occlusions and Infusion Site Reactions Insulin Lispro Injection ( n = 38 ) Regular human insulin ( n = 39 ) Catheter occlusions / month 0 . 09 0 . 10 Infusion site reactions 2 . 6 % ( 1 / 38 ) 2 . 6 % ( 1 / 39 ) In a randomized , 16 - week , open - label , parallel design study of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes , adverse event reports related to infusion - site reactions were similar for Insulin Lispro Injection and insulin aspart ( 21 % of 100 patients versus 17 % of 198 patients , respectively ) .
In both groups , the most frequently reported infusion site adverse events were infusion site erythema and infusion site reaction .
Allergic Reactions Local Allergy — As with any insulin therapy , patients taking Insulin Lispro Injection may experience redness , swelling , or itching at the site of the injection .
These minor reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks , but in some occasions , may require discontinuation of Insulin Lispro Injection .
In some instances , these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin , such as irritants in a skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique .
Systemic Allergy — Severe , life - threatening , generalized allergy , including anaphylaxis , may occur with any insulin , including Insulin Lispro Injection .
Generalized allergy to insulin may cause whole body rash ( including pruritus ) , dyspnea , wheezing , hypotension , tachycardia , or diaphoresis .
In controlled clinical trials , pruritus ( with or without rash ) was seen in 17 patients receiving regular human insulin ( n = 2969 ) and 30 patients receiving Insulin Lispro Injection ( n = 2944 ) .
Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with injected metacresol , which is an excipient in Insulin Lispro Injection [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Antibody Production In large clinical trials with patients with type 1 ( n = 509 ) and type 2 ( n = 262 ) diabetes mellitus , anti - insulin antibody ( insulin lispro - specific antibodies , insulin - specific antibodies , cross - reactive antibodies ) formation was evaluated in patients receiving both regular human insulin and Insulin Lispro Injection ( including patients previously treated with human insulin and naive patients ) .
As expected , the largest increase in the antibody levels occurred in patients new to insulin therapy .
The antibody levels peaked by 12 months and declined over the remaining years of the study .
These antibodies do not appear to cause deterioration in glycemic control or necessitate an increase in insulin dose .
There was no statistically significant relationship between the change in the total daily insulin dose and the change in percent antibody binding for any of the antibody types .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of Insulin Lispro Injection .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Medication errors in which other insulins have been accidentally substituted for Insulin Lispro Injection have been identified during post - approval use [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred .
Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis ; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Drugs that Affect Glucose Metabolism : Adjustment of insulin dosage may be needed .
( 7 . 1 , 7 . 2 , 7 . 3 ) • Anti - Adrenergic Drugs ( e . g . , beta - blockers , clonidine , guanethidine , and reserpine ) : Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent .
( 5 . 3 , 7 . 4 ) 7 . 1 Drugs That May Increase the Risk of Hypoglycemia The risk of hypoglycemia associated with Insulin Lispro Injection use may be increased when co - administered with antidiabetic agents , salicylates , sulfonamide antibiotics , monoamine oxidase inhibitors , fluoxetine , pramlintide , disopyramide , fibrates , pentoxifylline , ACE inhibitors , angiotensin II receptor blocking agents , and somatostatin analogs ( e . g . , octreotide ) .
Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when Insulin Lispro Injection is co - administered with these drugs .
7 . 2 Drugs That May Decrease the Blood Glucose Lowering Effect of Insulin Lispro Injection The glucose lowering effect of Insulin Lispro Injection may be decreased when co - administered with corticosteroids , isoniazid , niacin , estrogens , oral contraceptives , phenothiazines , danazol , diuretics , sympathomimetic agents ( e . g . , epinephrine , albuterol , terbutaline ) , somatropin , atypical antipsychotics , glucagon , protease inhibitors , and thyroid hormones .
Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when Insulin Lispro Injection is co - administered with these drugs .
7 . 3 Drugs That May Increase or Decrease the Blood Glucose Lowering Effect of Insulin Lispro Injection The glucose lowering effect of Insulin Lispro Injection may be increased or decreased with co - administered with beta - blockers , clonidine , lithium salts , and alcohol .
Pentamidine may cause hypoglycemia , which may sometimes be followed by hyperglycemia .
Dose adjustment and increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when Insulin Lispro Injection is co - administered with these drugs .
7 . 4 Drugs That May Blunt Signs and Symptoms of Hypoglycemia The signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] may be blunted when beta - blockers , clonidine , guanethidine , and reserpine are co - administered with Insulin Lispro Injection .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatrics : Not studied in children with type 2 diabetes or in children with type 1 diabetes < 3 years of age .
( 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with Insulin Lispro Injection in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug - associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes .
Published studies with insulin lispro used during pregnancy have not reported an association between insulin lispro and the induction of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ) .
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
Pregnant rats and rabbits were exposed to insulin lispro in animal reproduction studies during organogenesis .
No adverse effects on embryo / fetal viability or morphology were observed in offspring of rats exposed to insulin lispro at a dose approximately 3 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit insulin lispro / kg / day .
No adverse effects on embryo / fetal development were observed in offspring of rabbits exposed to insulin lispro at doses up to approximately 0 . 2 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit / kg / day ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 - 10 % in women with pre - gestational diabetes with a HbA1c > 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 - 25 % in women with a HbA1c > 10 .
The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis , pre - eclampsia , spontaneous abortions , preterm delivery , and delivery complications .
Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects , stillbirth , and macrosomia related morbidity .
Data Human Data Published data from retrospective studies and meta - analyses do not report an association with insulin lispro and major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when insulin lispro is used during pregnancy .
However , these studies cannot definitely establish or exclude the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations including small sample size , selection bias , confounding by unmeasured factors , and some lacking comparator groups .
Animal Data In a combined fertility and embryo - fetal development study , female rats were given subcutaneous insulin lispro injections of 1 , 5 , and 20 units / kg / day ( 0 . 2 , 0 . 8 , and 3 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit insulin lispro / kg / day , based on units / body surface area , respectively ) from 2 weeks prior to cohabitation through Gestation Day 19 .
There were no adverse effects on female fertility , implantation , or fetal viability and morphology .
However , fetal growth retardation was produced at the 20 units / kg / day - dose as indicated by decreased fetal weight and an increased incidence of fetal runts / litter .
In an embryo - fetal development study in pregnant rabbits , insulin lispro doses of 0 . 1 , 0 . 25 , and 0 . 75 unit / kg / day ( 0 . 03 , 0 . 08 , and 0 . 2 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit insulin lispro / kg / day , based on units / body surface area , respectively ) were injected subcutaneously on Gestation days 7 through 19 .
There were no adverse effects on fetal viability , weight , and morphology at any dose .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of Insulin Lispro Injection in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effect on milk production .
One small published study reported that exogenous insulin was present in human milk .
However , there is insufficient information to determine the effects of Insulin Lispro Injection on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of Insulin Lispro Injection on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for insulin , any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Insulin Lispro Injection or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Insulin Lispro Injection is approved for use in children for subcutaneous daily injections [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Insulin Lispro Injection is approved for use in children by continuous subcutaneous infusion in insulin pumps .
Insulin Lispro Injection has not been studied in pediatric patients younger than 3 years of age .
Insulin Lispro Injection has not been studied in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes .
As in adults , the dosage of Insulin Lispro Injection must be individualized in pediatric patients based on metabolic needs and results of frequent monitoring of blood glucose .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects ( n = 2834 ) in eight clinical studies of Insulin Lispro Injection , twelve percent ( n = 338 ) were 65 years of age or over .
The majority of these had type 2 diabetes .
HbA1c values and hypoglycemia rates did not differ by age .
Pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic studies to assess the effect of age on the onset of Insulin Lispro Injection action have not been performed .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Patients with renal impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Lispro Injection dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of hypoglycemia and may require more frequent Insulin Lispro Injection dose adjustment and more frequent blood glucose monitoring [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Excess insulin administration may cause hypoglycemia and hypokalemia .
Mild episodes of hypoglycemia usually can be treated with oral glucose .
Adjustments in drug dosage , meal patterns , or exercise may be needed .
More severe episodes with coma , seizure , or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular / subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose .
Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery .
Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately .
11 DESCRIPTION Insulin Lispro Injection is a rapid - acting human insulin analog .
Insulin lispro is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non - pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli .
Insulin lispro differs from human insulin in that the amino acid proline at position B28 is replaced by lysine and the lysine in position B29 is replaced by proline .
Chemically , it is Lys ( B28 ) , Pro ( B29 ) human insulin analog and has the empirical formula C257H383N65O77S6 and a molecular weight of 5808 , both identical to that of human insulin .
Insulin Lispro Injection has the following primary structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Insulin Lispro Injection is a sterile , aqueous , clear , and colorless solution for subcutaneous or intravenous use .
Each milliliter of Insulin Lispro Injection contains 100 units of insulin lispro , dibasic sodium phosphate ( 1 . 88 mg ) , glycerin ( 16 mg ) , Metacresol ( 3 . 15 mg ) , zinc oxide ( content adjusted to provide 0 . 0197 mg zinc ion ) , trace amounts of phenol , and Water for Injection , USP .
Insulin lispro has a pH of 7 . 0 to 7 . 8 .
The pH is adjusted by addition of aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid 10 % and / or sodium hydroxide 10 % .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Regulation of glucose metabolism is the primary activity of insulins and insulin analogs , including insulin lispro .
Insulins lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake by skeletal muscle and fat , and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production .
Insulins inhibit lipolysis and proteolysis , and enhance protein synthesis .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Insulin Lispro Injection has been shown to be equipotent to human insulin on a molar basis .
One unit of Insulin Lispro Injection has the same glucose - lowering effect as one unit of regular human insulin .
Studies in normal volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that Insulin Lispro Injection has a more rapid onset of action and a shorter duration of activity than regular human insulin when given subcutaneously .
The time course of action of insulin and insulin analogs , such as Insulin Lispro Injection , may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same individual .
The parameters of Insulin Lispro Injection activity ( time of onset , peak time , and duration ) as designated in Figure 1 should be considered only as general guidelines .
The rate of insulin absorption , and consequently the onset of activity are known to be affected by the site of injection , exercise , and other variables [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] a Baseline insulin concentration was maintained by infusion of 0 . 2 mU / min / kg human insulin .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Intravenous Administration — The glucose lowering effect of intravenously administered Insulin Lispro Injection was tested in 21 patients with type 1 diabetes .
For the study , the patients ' usual doses of insulin were held and blood glucose concentrations were allowed to reach a stable range of 200 to 260 mg / dL during a one to three hours run - in phase .
The run - in phase was followed by a 6 - hour assessment phase .
During the assessment phase , patients received intravenous Insulin Lispro Injection at an initial infusion rate of 0 . 5 units / hour .
The infusion rate of Insulin Lispro Injection could be adjusted at regular timed intervals to achieve and maintain blood glucose concentrations between 100 to 160 mg / dL .
The mean blood glucose levels during the assessment phase for patients on Insulin Lispro Injection therapy are summarized below in Table 4 .
All patients achieved the targeted glucose range at some point during the 6 - hour assessment phase .
At the endpoint , blood glucose was within the target range ( 100 to 160 mg / dL ) for 17 of 20 patients treated with Insulin Lispro Injection .
The average time ( ± SE ) required to attain near normoglycemia was 129 ± 14 minutes for Insulin Lispro Injection .

In healthy volunteers given subcutaneous doses of Insulin Lispro Injection ranging from 0 . 1 to 0 . 4 unit / kg , peak serum levels were seen 30 to 90 minutes after dosing .
When healthy volunteers received equivalent doses of regular human insulin , peak insulin levels occurred between 50 to 120 minutes after dosing .
Similar results were seen in patients with type 1 diabetes ( see Figure 2 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] a Baseline insulin concentration was maintained by infusion of 0 . 2 mU / min / kg human insulin .
Insulin Lispro Injection was absorbed at a consistently faster rate than regular human insulin in healthy male volunteers given 0 . 2 unit / kg at abdominal , deltoid , or femoral subcutaneous sites .
After Insulin Lispro Injection was administered in the abdomen , serum drug levels were higher and the duration of action was slightly shorter than after deltoid or thigh administration .
Bioavailability of Insulin Lispro Injection is similar to that of regular human insulin .
The absolute bioavailability after subcutaneous injection ranges from 55 % to 77 % with doses between 0 . 1 to 0 . 2 unit / kg , inclusive .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Distribution — When administered intravenously as bolus injections of 0 . 1 and 0 . 2 U / kg dose in two separate groups of healthy subjects , the mean volume of distribution of Insulin Lispro Injection appeared to decrease with increase in dose ( 1 . 55 and 0 . 72 L / kg , respectively ) in contrast to that of regular human insulin for which , the volume of distribution was comparable across the two dose groups ( 1 . 37 and 1 . 12 L / kg for 0 . 1 and 0 . 2 U / kg dose , respectively ) .
Metabolism — Human metabolism studies have not been conducted .
However , animal studies indicate that the metabolism of Insulin Lispro Injection is identical to that of regular human insulin .
Elimination — After subcutaneous administration of Insulin Lispro Injection , the t1 / 2 is shorter than that of regular human insulin ( 1 versus 1 . 5 hours , respectively ) .
When administered intravenously , Insulin Lispro Injection and regular human insulin demonstrated similar dose - dependent clearance , with a mean clearance of 21 . 0 mL / min / kg and 21 . 4 mL / min / kg , respectively ( 0 . 1 unit / kg dose ) , and 9 . 6 mL / min / kg and 9 . 4 mL / min / kg , respectively ( 0 . 2 unit / kg dose ) .
Accordingly , Insulin Lispro Injection demonstrated a mean t1 / 2 of 0 . 85 hours ( 51 minutes ) and 0 . 92 hours ( 55 minutes ) , respectively for 0 . 1 unit / kg and 0 . 2 unit / kg doses , and regular human insulin mean t1 / 2 was 0 . 79 hours ( 47 minutes ) and 1 . 28 hours ( 77 minutes ) , respectively for 0 . 1 unit / kg and 0 . 2 unit / kg doses .
Specific Populations The effects of age , gender , race , obesity , pregnancy , or smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin Lispro Injection have not been studied .
Renal Impairment — Type 2 diabetic patients with varying degree of renal impairment showed no difference in pharmacokinetics of regular insulin and Insulin Lispro Injection .
However , the sensitivity of the patients to insulin did change , with an increased response to insulin as the renal function declined .
Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with renal impairment .
Careful glucose monitoring and dose adjustments of insulin , including Insulin Lispro Injection , may be necessary in patients with renal dysfunction .
Hepatic Impairment — Type 2 diabetic patients with impaired hepatic function showed no effect on the pharmacokinetics of Insulin Lispro Injection as compared to patients with no hepatic dysfunction .
However , some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with liver failure .
Careful glucose monitoring and dose adjustments of insulin , including Insulin Lispro Injection , may be necessary in patients with hepatic dysfunction .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Standard 2 - year carcinogenicity studies in animals have not been performed .
In Fischer 344 rats , a 12 - month repeat - dose toxicity study was conducted with insulin lispro at subcutaneous doses of 20 and 200 units / kg / day ( approximately 3 and 32 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit / kg / day , based on units / body surface area ) .
Insulin lispro did not produce important target organ toxicity including mammary tumors at any dose .
Insulin lispro was not mutagenic in the following genetic toxicity assays : bacterial mutation , unscheduled DNA synthesis , mouse lymphoma , chromosomal aberration and micronucleus assays .
Male fertility was not compromised when male rats given subcutaneous insulin lispro injections of 5 and 20 units / kg / day ( 0 . 8 and 3 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit / kg / day , based on units / body surface area ) for 6 months were mated with untreated female rats .
In a combined fertility , perinatal , and postnatal study in male and female rats given 1 , 5 , and 20 units / kg / day subcutaneously ( 0 . 2 , 0 . 8 , and 3 times the human subcutaneous dose of 1 unit / kg / day , based on units / body surface area ) , mating and fertility were not adversely affected in either gender at any dose .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology In standard biological assays in fasted rabbits , 0 . 2 unit / kg of insulin lispro injected subcutaneously had the same glucose - lowering effect and had a more rapid onset of action as 0 . 2 unit / kg of regular human insulin .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of Insulin Lispro Injection were studied in children , adolescent , and adult patients with type 1 diabetes ( n = 789 ) and adult patients with type 2 diabetes ( n = 722 ) .
14 . 1 Type 1 Diabetes – Adults and Adolescents A 12 - month , randomized , parallel , open - label , active - controlled study was conducted in patients with type 1 diabetes to assess the safety and efficacy of Insulin Lispro Injection ( n = 81 ) compared with Humulin ® R [ insulin human injection ( 100 units per mL ) ] ( n = 86 ) .
Insulin Lispro Injection was administered by subcutaneous injection immediately prior to meals and Humulin R was administered 30 to 45 minutes before meals .
Humulin ® U [ ULTRALENTE ® human insulin ( rDNA origin ) extended zinc suspension ] was administered once or twice daily as the basal insulin .
There was a 2 - to 4 - week run - in period with Humulin R and Humulin U before randomization .
Most patients were Caucasian ( 97 % ) .
Forty - seven percent of the patients were male .
The mean age was 31 years ( range 12 to 70 years ) .
Glycemic control , the total daily doses of Insulin Lispro Injection and Humulin R , and the incidence of severe hypoglycemia ( as determined by the number of events that were not self - treated ) were similar in the two treatment groups .
There were no episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis in either treatment group .

Insulin Lispro Injection was administered by subcutaneous injection immediately before meals and Humulin R was administered 30 to 45 minutes before meals .
Humulin ® N [ NPH human insulin ( rDNA origin ) isophane suspension ] or Humulin U was administered once or twice daily as the basal insulin .
All patients participated in a 2 - to 4 - week run - in period with Humulin R and Humulin N or Humulin U . Most of the patients were Caucasian ( 88 % ) , and the numbers of men and women in each group were approximately equal .
The mean age was 58 . 6 years ( range 23 . 8 to 85 years ) .
The average body mass index ( BMI ) was 28 . 2 kg / m2 .
During the study , the majority of patients used Humulin N ( 84 % ) compared with Humulin U ( 16 % ) as their basal insulin .
The reductions from baseline in HbA1c and the incidence of severe hypoglycemia ( as determined by the number of events that were not self - treated ) were similar between the two treatments from the combined groups ( see Table 6 ) .

One study involved 39 patients , ages 19 to 58 years , treated for 24 weeks with Insulin Lispro Injection or regular human insulin .
After 12 weeks of treatment , the mean HbA1c values decreased from 7 . 8 % to 7 . 2 % in the Insulin Lispro Injection - treated patients and from 7 . 8 % to 7 . 5 % in the regular human insulin - treated patients .
Another study involved 60 patients ( mean age 39 , range 15 to 58 years ) treated for 24 weeks with either Insulin Lispro Injection or buffered regular human insulin .
After 12 weeks of treatment , the mean HbA1c values decreased from 7 . 7 % to 7 . 4 % in the Insulin Lispro Injection - treated patients and remained unchanged from 7 . 7 % in the buffered regular human insulin - treated patients .
Rates of hypoglycemia were comparable between treatment groups in both studies .
14 . 5 Type 1 Diabetes – Pediatric Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion A randomized , 16 - week , open - label , parallel design , study of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes ( n = 298 ) aged 4 to 18 years compared two subcutaneous infusion regimens administered via an external insulin pump : insulin aspart ( n = 198 ) or Insulin Lispro Injection ( n = 100 ) .
These two treatments resulted in comparable changes from baseline in HbA1c and comparable rates of hypoglycemia after 16 weeks of treatment ( see Table 8 ) .
Infusion site reactions were similar between groups .

Instructions For Patients Using Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Pumps Patients using external pump infusion therapy should be trained appropriately .
The following insulin pumps have been tested in Insulin Lispro Injection clinical trials conducted by Eli Lilly and Company .
• Disetronic ® H - Tron ® plus V100 , D - Tron ® and D - Tronplus ® with Disetronic Rapid infusion sets1 • MiniMed ® Models 506 , 507 and 508 and Polyfin ® infusion sets2 Insulin Lispro Injection is recommended for use in pump systems suitable for insulin infusion such as MiniMed , Disetronic , and other equivalent pumps .
Before using Insulin Lispro Injection in a pump system , read the pump label to make sure the pump is indicated for continuous delivery of fast - acting insulin .
Insulin Lispro Injection is recommended for use in any reservoir and infusion sets that are compatible with insulin and the specific pump .
Please see recommended reservoir and infusion sets in the pump manual .
To avoid insulin degradation , infusion set occlusion , and loss of the preservative ( metacresol ) , insulin in the reservoir should be replaced at least every 7 days ; infusion sets and infusion set insertion sites should be changed at least every 3 days .
Insulin exposed to temperatures higher than 98 . 6 ° F ( 37 ° C ) should be discarded .
The temperature of the insulin may exceed ambient temperature when the pump housing , cover , tubing or sport case is exposed to sunlight or radiant heat .
Infusion sites that are erythematous , pruritic , or thickened should be reported to the healthcare professional , and a new site selected because continued infusion may increase the skin reaction or alter the absorption of Insulin Lispro Injection .
Pump or infusion set malfunctions or insulin degradation can lead to rapid hyperglycemia and ketosis .
This is especially pertinent for rapid acting insulin analogs that are more rapidly absorbed through skin and have a shorter duration of action .
Prompt identification and correction of the cause of hyperglycemia or ketosis is necessary .
Problems include pump malfunction , infusion set occlusion , leakage , disconnection or kinking , and degraded insulin .
Less commonly , hypoglycemia from pump malfunction may occur .
If these problems cannot be promptly corrected , patients should resume therapy with subcutaneous insulin injection and contact their healthcare professionals [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and How Supplied / Storage and Handling ( 16 . 2 ) ] .
