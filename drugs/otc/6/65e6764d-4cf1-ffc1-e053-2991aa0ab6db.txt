For Use in the Extracorporeal Rejuvenation of Red Blood Cells 50 mL Glass Vial NDC 23731 - 7000 - 5 PN 7012 12 Vials / Case DESCRIPTION Rejuvesol ® Red Blood Cell Processing Solution ( rejuvesol ® Solution ) is a sterile , non - pyrogenic solution of sodium pyruvate , inosine , adenine , dibasic sodium phosphate , and monobasic sodium phosphate in water for injection intended only for use in the extracorporeal rejuvenation of a unit of red blood cell concentrate ( RBC ) .
Each 50 mL of rejuvesol ® Solution contains sodium pyruvate 0 . 550 g , inosine 1 . 34 g , adenine 0 . 034 g , dibasic sodium phosphate ( heptahydrate ) 0 . 730 g , and monobasic sodium phosphate ( monohydrate ) 0 . 311 g , in water for injection , pH 6 . 7 - 7 . 4 .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY A gradual depletion of red blood cell adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) and 2 , 3 diphosphoglycerate ( 2 , 3 - DPG ) occurs with storage of RBC at 1 - 6 ° C . 1 The level of 2 , 3 - DPG in RBC stored for greater than 14 days is less than 10 % of normal 1 , 2 , 12 , 17 , 18 .
Rejuvenation of RBC with rejuvesol ® Solution increases the levels of ATP and 2 , 3 - DPG .
1 - 5 , 8 , 13 , 17 - 22 , 24 , 25 An in vitro loss of red blood cells occurs with the preservation and processing of RBC .
Thus , the effectiveness of a transfusion is influenced by both the total number of red blood cells transfused and the number of those cells which remain in circulation .
Therefore , the " dose " of a transfusion is defined as the percentage of pre - transfusion recovered red blood cells multiplied by the 24 hour post - transfusion survival value .
Rejuvenation is accomplished by incubating the contents of one 50 mL vial of rejuvesol ® Solution with one unit of RBC ( prepared from up to 550 mL of whole blood ) for sixty ( 60 ) minutes at 37 ° C . Citra recommends that the entire 50 mL of rejuvesol ® Solution be added to a " smaller than normal " RBC as long as the prerejuvenation net packed cell weight is greater than 110 grams .
1 , 9 INDICATION AND USAGE Rejuvesol ® Solution is intended only to be used as an in vitro processing solution for the rejuvenation of a unit of RBC .
RBC may be rejuvenated after storage in CPD ( non - leukocyte reduced ) , CPDA - 1 , ( non - leukocyte reduced ) , CPD / ADSOL ® ( CPD / AS - 1 leukocyte reduced ) , or CP2D / Nutricel ® ( CP2D / AS - 3 , leukocyte reduced ) .
The final concentration of ATP and 2 , 3 - DPG achieved after rejuvenation will vary depending on the number of days of liquid storage at 1 - 6 ° C prior to rejuvenation .
NOTE : For simplicity , RBC stored in CPD ( non - leukocyte reduced ) , CPDA - 1 ( non - leukocyte reduced ) , CPD / ADSOL ® ( CPD / AS - 1 leukocyte reduced ) , CP2D / Nutricel ® ( CP2D / AS - 3 , leukocyte reduced ) are referred to hereafter as CPD , CPDA - 1 , CPD / AS - 1 , and CP2D / AS - 3 , respectively .
Citra Labs , LLC , recommends that rejuvenation of RBC be performed after 14 days or longer of liquid storage .
RBC ( CPD , CPDA - 1 , CPD / AS - 1 , and CP2D / AS - 3 ) rejuvenated before 6 days of storage may achieve 2 , 3 - DPG levels in excess of 2 times normal and ATP levels in excess of 1 . 5 times normal 5 , 6 ( See Warning and Contraindications ) .
Rejuvenation of CPD or CPDA - 1 RBC for Immediate use or for Cryopreservation RBC which have been collected and stored in CPD or CPDA - 1 anticoagulant may be rejuvenated up to three days after the expiration date of the RBC , as long as storage at 1 - 6 ° C is not interrupted .
3 , 4 After rejuvenation , RBC ( CPD and CPDA - 1 ) must be either washed and stored at 1 - 6 ° C for up to 24 hours prior to transfusion or glycerolized and frozen at – 80 ° C ( below – 65 ° C ) .
Red Blood Cells Frozen Rejuvenated which were collected and stored in CPD or CPDA - 1 may be stored frozen up to 10 years .
10 When RBC are rejuvenated after maximum liquid storage , i . e . , CPD RBC at 24 days or CPDA - 1 RBC at 38 days , the concentrations of 2 , 3 - DPG and ATP increase typically to above normal .
1 , 3 - 5 , 6 CAUTION : RBC collected in CPD or CPDA - 1 cannot be leukocyte reduced prior to rejuvenation .
Rejuvenation of CPD / AS - 1 RBC or CP2D / AS - 3 Rejuvesol ® Solution has not been approved for the rejuvenation of RBC stored in any additive systems other than AS - 1 or AS - 3 .
RBC stored in CPD / AS - 1 or CP2D / AS - 3 at 1 - 6 ° C may be rejuvenated up to , but not exceeding , 42 days of storage as long as storage at 1 - 6 ° C is not interrupted .
Rejuvenated CPD / AS - 1 RBC must be either washed and stored at 1 - 6 ° C for up to 24 hours prior to transfusion or glycerolized and frozen at – 80 ° C ( below – 65 ° C ) .
Red Blood Cells Frozen Rejuvenated which were collected and stored in CPD / AS - 1 may be stored for up to 3 years .
Rejuvenated CP2D / AS - 3 RBC must be washed and stored at 1 - 6 ° C for up to 24 hours prior to transfusion .
Unlike rejuvenated CPD , CPDA - 1 , CPD / AS - 1 RBC , and CP2D / AS - 3 , rejuvenated RBC collected and stored in any other anticoagulant / additive solution combination have not been approved to be immediately washed and transfused or for cryopreservation .
Rejuvenation of CPD / AS - 1 RBC for Cryopreservation When CPD / AS - 1 RBC are rejuvenated at 42 days of liquid storage , frozen , deglycerolized , and stored for 24 hours , the concentration of 2 , 3 - DPG and ATP increases to above normal .
In a limited study , the average 24 hour post - transfusion survival value of these cells was statistically higher than the reported 12 survival value of CPD / AS - 1 red blood cell concentrates which are stored for 42 days prior to transfusion .
The " dose " may be equivalent for a CPD / AS - 1 RBC whether the unit is stored for 42 days prior to transfusion or stored for 42 days , rejuvenated , frozen , deglycerolized , and stored for 24 hours prior to transfusion .
Unlike rejuvenated CPD / AS - 1 RBC , rejuvenated RBC ( CP2D / AS - 3 ) has not been approved for cryopreservation .
Rejuvenation of CPD / AS - 1 RBC or CP2D / AS - 3 for Immediate Use When CPD / AS - 1 RBC are rejuvenated at 42 days of liquid storage , washed , and stored for 24 hours , the concentration of ATP increases to day 0 values .
For 2 , 3 - DPG rejuvenation of RBCs stored in CPD / AS - 1 for 42 days , the range of 2 , 3 DPG relative to day 0 value was 46 % - 172 % with a mean of 98 % ± 29 % .
For 66 % of the RBC units ( 44 / 67 , 33 / 33 in Site A and 11 / 34 in Site B ) the concentration of 2 , 3 - DPG reached at least 80 % of the day 0 value .
When CP2D / AS - 3 RBC are rejuvenated at 42 days of liquid storage , washed , and stored for 24 hours , the concentration of ATP increases to day 0 values .
For 2 , 3 - DPG rejuvenation of RBCs stored in CPD / AS - 1 for 42 days , the range of 2 , 3 DPG relative to day 0 value was 48 % - 150 % with a mean of 96 % ± 23 % .
For 76 % of the RBC units ( 52 / 68 , 30 / 35 in Site A and 22 / 33 in Site B ) the concentration of 2 , 3 - DPG reached at least 80 % of the day 0 value .
WARNING AND CONTRAINDICATIONS Rejuvesol ® Solution is intended only for the extracorporeal rejuvenation of a RBC .
It should never be directly administered to Humans .
Rejuvesol ® Solution must not be added to whole blood because the additional plasma may reduce the effectiveness of the rejuvenation process .
Immediately after rejuvenation , RBC must either be washed via an approved protocol prior to transfusion or glycerolized and frozen .
RBC which have been rejuvenated , glycerolized , and frozen must be deglycerolized via an approved protocol prior to transfusion .
RBC rejuvenated before 6 days of storage may achieve 2 , 3 - DPG levels in excess of 2 times normal and ATP levels in excess of 1 . 5 times normal .
5 , 6 In patients with reduced arterial blood p0 2 of less than 40 torr , the use of RBC rejuvenated before 6 days of storage are contraindicated because their high 2 , 3 - DPG levels and low oxygen affinity may impair proper oxygenation of the red blood cells in the lung .
7 Rejuvenated RBC are further processed prior to transfusion to remove the un - used portion of rejuvesol ® Solution , by - products of the rejuvenation process , and any other potential storage - related impurities in rejuvesol ® Solution .
Based on the concentration of the residual inosine in rejuvenated RBC that are either washed or deglycerolized , the average washout of inosine was calculated to be > 97 . 4 % .
A literature search for potential toxicity associated with the ingredients that comprise rejuvesol ® Solution , including potential metabolites , was conducted .
23 This report concludes that no theoretical contraindications would be associated with the transfusion of a single unit of unwashed , rejuvenated RBC that would contain amounts of pyruvate , inosine , adenine , phosphate , hypoxanthine , uric acid , and lactate that exceed reference values ( excluding lactate ) as these substances are naturally metabolized and / or are excreted .
23 The maximum number of properly processed rejuvenated RBC that can be transfused to a single recipient over their entire lifetime has not been determined .
