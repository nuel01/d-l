Prescribing Information DESCRIPTION Amlodipine besylate is a besylate salt of amlodipine , and is a long - acting calcium channel blocker .
Amlodipine besylate monohydrate is chemically described as 3 - Ethyl - 5 - methyl ( ± ) - 2 - [ ( 2 - aminoethoxy ) methyl ] - 4 - ( 2 - chlorophenyl ) - 1 , 4 - dihydro - 6 - methyl - 3 , 5 - pyridinedicarboxylate , monobenzenesulphonate monohydrate .
Its molecular formula is C20H25ClN2O5 • C6H6SO3 • H2O and its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Amlodipine besylate monohydrate is a white crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 585 . 07 .
It is slightly soluble in water , ethanol , acetone and 2 - propanol and soluble in N , N - dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide .
Amlodipine besylate tablets are formulated as white to off - white tablets equivalent to 2 . 5 , 5 and 10 mg of amlodipine for oral administration .
In addition to the active ingredient , amlodipine besylate , each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients : microcrystalline cellulose , sodium starch glycolate , and magnesium stearate .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist ( calcium ion antagonist or slow - channel blocker ) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle .
Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites .
The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels .
Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively , with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells .
Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses .
Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine .
Within the physiologic pH range , amlodipine is an ionized compound ( pKa = 8 . 6 ) , and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site , resulting in a gradual onset of effect .
Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure .
The precise mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully delineated , but are thought to include the following : Exertional Angina : In patients with exertional angina , amlodipine reduces the total peripheral resistance ( afterload ) against which the heart works and reduces the rate pressure product , and thus myocardial oxygen demand , at any given level of exercise .
Vasospastic Angina : Amlodipine has been demonstrated to block constriction and restore blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to calcium , potassium epinephrine , serotonin , and thromboxane A2 analog in experimental animal models and in human coronary vessels in vitro .
This inhibition of coronary spasm is responsible for the effectiveness of amlodipine in vasospastic ( Prinzmetal ' s or variant ) angina .
Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine , absorption produces peak plasma concentrations between 6 and 12 hours .
Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 90 % .
The bioavailability of amlodipine is not altered by the presence of food .
Amlodipine is extensively ( about 90 % ) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism with 10 % of the parent compound and 60 % of the metabolites excreted in the urine .
Ex vivo studies have shown that approximately 93 % of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients .
Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half - life of about 30 to 50 hours .
Steady - state plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing .
The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment .
Patients with renal failure may therefore receive the usual initial dose .
Elderly patients and patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40 to 60 % , and a lower initial dose may be required .
A similar increase in AUC was observed in patients with moderate to severe heart failure .
Pediatric Patients Sixty - two hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of amlodipine besylate between 1 . 25 mg and 20 mg .
Weight - adjusted clearance and volume of distribution were similar to values in adults .
Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension , amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures .
These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing .
Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina , chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina .
With chronic once daily oral administration , antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours .
Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients .
The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation ; thus , individuals with moderate hypertension ( diastolic pressure 105 to 114 mmHg ) had about a 50 % greater response than patients with mild hypertension ( diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mmHg ) .
Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures ( + 1 / - 2 mmHg ) .
In hypertensive patients with normal renal function , therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria As with other calcium channel blockers , hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise ( or pacing ) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP / dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume .
In hemodynamic studies , amlodipine has not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man , even when coadministered with beta - blockers to man .
Similar findings , however , have been observed in normals or well - compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects .
Electrophysiologic Effects Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man .
In patients with chronic stable angina , intravenous administration of 10 mg did not significantly alter A - H and H - V conduction and sinus node recovery time after pacing .
Similar results were obtained in patients receiving amlodipine and concomitant beta blockers .
In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta - blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina , no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed .
In clinical trials with angina patients alone , amlodipine therapy did not alter electrocardiographic intervals or produce higher degrees of AV blocks .
Clinical Studies Effects in Hypertension Adult Patients : The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double - blind , placebo - controlled , randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine and 538 on placebo .
Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo - corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose , averaging about 12 / 6 mmHg in the standing position and 13 / 7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension .
Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24 - hour dosing interval was observed , with little difference in peak and trough effect .
Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for up to 1 year .
The 3 parallel , fixed dose , dose response studies showed that the reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was dose - related within the recommended dosing range .
Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young and older patients .
The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older patients , perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure .
Effects were similar in black patients and in white patients .
Pediatric Patients Two - hundred sixty - eight hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomized first to amlodipine besylate 2 . 5 or 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomized again to the same dose or to placebo for another 4 weeks .
Patients receiving 5 mg at the end of 8 weeks had lower blood pressure than those secondarily randomized to placebo .
The magnitude of the treatment effect is difficult to interpret , but it is probably less than 5 mmHg systolic on the 5 - mg dose .
Adverse events were similar to those seen in adults .
Effects in Chronic Stable Angina The effectiveness of 5 to 10 mg / day of amlodipine in exercise - induced angina has been evaluated in 8 placebo - controlled , double - blind clinical trials of up to 6 weeks duration involving 1038 patients ( 684 amlodipine , 354 placebo ) with chronic stable angina .
In 5 of the 8 studies significant increases in exercise time ( bicycle or treadmill ) were seen with the 10 mg dose .
Increases in symptom - limited exercise time averaged 12 . 8 % ( 63 sec ) for amlodipine 10 mg , and averaged 7 . 9 % ( 38 sec ) for amlodipine 5 mg .
Amlodipine 10 mg also increased time to 1 mm ST segment deviation in several studies and decreased angina attack rate .
The sustained efficacy of amlodipine in angina patients has been demonstrated over long - term dosing .
In patients with angina there were no clinically significant reductions in blood pressures ( 4 / 1 mmHg ) or changes in heart rate ( + 0 . 3 bpm ) .
Effects in Vasospastic Angina In a double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trial of 4 weeks duration in 50 patients , amlodipine therapy decreased attacks by approximately 4 / week compared with a placebo decrease of approximately 1 / week ( p < 0 . 01 ) .
Two ( 2 ) of 23 amlodipine and 7 of 27 placebo patients discontinued from the study due to lack of clinical improvement .
Studies in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure Amlodipine has been compared to placebo in four 8 to 12 week studies of patients with NYHA class II / III heart failure , involving a total of 697 patients .
In these studies , there was no evidence of worsened heart failure based on measures of exercise tolerance , NYHA classification , symptoms , or left ventricular ejection fraction .
In a long - term ( follow - up at least 6 months , mean 13 . 8 months ) placebo - controlled mortality / morbidity study of amlodipine 5 to 10 mg in 1153 patients with NYHA classes III ( n = 931 ) or IV ( n = 222 ) heart failure on stable doses of diuretics , digoxin , and ACE inhibitors , amlodipine had no effect on the primary endpoint of the study which was the combined endpoint of all - cause mortality and cardiac morbidity ( as defined by life - threatening arrhythmia , acute myocardial infarction , or hospitalization for worsened heart failure ) , or on NYHA classification , or symptoms of heart failure .
Total combined all - cause mortality and cardiac morbidity events were 222 / 571 ( 39 % ) for patients on amlodipine and 246 / 583 ( 42 % ) for patients on placebo ; the cardiac morbid events represented about 25 % of the endpoints in the study .
Another study ( PRAISE - 2 ) randomized patients with NYHA class III ( 80 % ) or IV ( 20 % ) heart failure without clinical symptoms or objective evidence of underlying ischemic disease , on stable doses of ACE inhibitor ( 99 % ) , digitalis ( 99 % ) and diuretics ( 99 % ) , to placebo ( n = 827 ) or amlodipine ( n = 827 ) and followed them for a mean of 33 months .
There was no statistically significant difference between amlodipine and placebo in the primary endpoint of all - cause mortality ( 95 % confidence limits from 8 % reduction to 29 % increase on amlodipine ) .
With amlodipine there were more reports of pulmonary edema .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypertension Amlodipine besylate is indicated for the treatment of hypertension .
It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents .
Chronic Stable Angina Amlodipine besylate is indicated for the treatment of chronic stable angina .
Amlodipine besylate may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents .
Vasospastic Angina ( Prinzmetal ' s or Variant Angina ) Amlodipine besylate is indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina .
Amlodipine besylate may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal drugs .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Amlodipine besylate is contraindicated in patients with known sensitivity to amlodipine .
WARNINGS Increased Angina and / or Myocardial Infarction Rarely , patients , particularly those with severe obstructive coronary artery disease , have developed documented increased frequency , duration and / or severity of angina or acute myocardial infarction on starting calcium channel blocker therapy or at the time of dosage increase .
The mechanism of this effect has not been elucidated .
PRECAUTIONS General Since the vasodilation induced by amlodipine is gradual in onset , acute hypotension has rarely been reported after oral administration .
Nonetheless , caution as with any other peripheral vasodilator , should be exercised when administering amlodipine , particularly in patients with severe aortic stenosis .
Use in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure In general , calcium channel blockers should be used with caution in patients with heart failure .
Amlodipine ( 5 to 10 mg / day ) has been studied in a placebo - controlled trial of 1153 patients with NYHA Class III or IV heart failure ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ) on stable doses of ACE inhibitor , digoxin , and diuretics .
Follow - up was at least 6 months , with a mean of about 14 months .
There was no overall adverse effect on survival or cardiac morbidity ( as defined by life - threatening arrhythmia , acute myocardial infarction , or hospitalization for worsened heart failure ) .
Amlodipine has been compared to placebo in four 8 to 12 week studies of patients with NYHA class II / III heart failure , involving a total of 697 patients .
In these studies , there was no evidence of worsened heart failure based on measures of exercise tolerance , NYHA classification , symptoms , or LVEF .
Beta - Blocker Withdrawal Amlodipine is not a beta - blocker and therefore gives no protection against the dangers of abrupt beta - blocker withdrawal ; any such withdrawal should be by gradual reduction of the dose of beta - blocker .
Patients with Hepatic Failure Since amlodipine is extensively metabolized by the liver and the plasma elimination half - life ( t ½ ) is 56 hours in patients with impaired hepatic function , caution should be exercised when administering amlodipine to patients with severe hepatic impairment .
Drug Interactions In vitro data indicate that amlodipine has no effect on the human plasma protein binding of digoxin , phenytoin , warfarin , and indomethacin .
Effect of other agents on amlodipine CIMETIDINE : Coadministration of amlodipine with cimetidine did not alter the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine .
GRAPEFRUIT JUICE : Coadministration of 240 mL of grapefruit juice with a single oral dose of amlodipine 10 mg in 20 healthy volunteers had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine .
MAALOX ( antacid ) : Coadministration of the antacid Maalox with a single dose of amlodipine had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of amlodipine .
SILDENAFIL : A single 100 mg dose of sildenafil ( Viagra ® ) in subjects with essential hypertension had no effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of amlodipine .
When amlodipine and sildenafil were used in combination , each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect .
Effect of amlodipine on other agents ATORVASTATIN : Coadministration of multiple 10 mg doses of amlodipine with 80 mg of atorvastatin resulted in no significant change in the steady state pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin .
DIGOXIN : Coadministration of amlodipine with digoxin did not change serum digoxin levels or digoxin renal clearance in normal volunteers .
ETHANOL ( alcohol ) : Single and multiple 10 mg doses of amlodipine had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of ethanol .
WARFARIN : Coadministration of amlodipine with warfarin did not change the warfarin prothrombin response time .
In clinical trials , amlodipine has been safely administered with thiazide diuretics , beta - blockers , angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors , long - acting nitrates , sublingual nitroglycerin , digoxin , warfarin , non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , antibiotics , and oral hypoglycemic drugs .
Drug / Laboratory Test Interactions None known .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Rats and mice treated with amlodipine maleate in the diet for up to two years , at concentrations calculated to provide daily dosage levels of 0 . 5 , 1 . 25 , and 2 . 5 amlodipine mg / kg / day , showed no evidence of a carcinogenic effect of the drug .
For the mouse , the highest dose was , on a mg / m2 basis , similar to the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg amlodipine / day [ 1 ] .
For the rat , the highest dose was , on a mg / m2 basis , about twice the maximum recommended human dose .
null Mutagenicity studies conducted with amlodipine maleate revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome level .
There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated orally with amlodipine maleate ( males for 64 days and females for 14 days prior to mating ) at doses up to 10 mg amlodipine / kg / day ( 8 times null the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg / day on a mg / m2 basis ) .
[ 1 ] Based on patient weight of 50 kg .
Pregnancy Category C No evidence of teratogenicity or other embryo / fetal toxicity was found when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate at doses up to 10 mg amlodipine / kg / day ( respectively 8 times null and 23 times null the maximum recommended human dose of 10 mg on a mg / m2 basis ) during their respective periods of major organogenesis .
However , litter size was significantly decreased ( by about 50 % ) and the number of intrauterine deaths was significantly increased ( about 5 - fold ) in rats receiving amlodipine maleate at a dose equivalent to 10 mg amlodipine / kg / day for 14 days before mating and throughout mating and gestation .
Amlodipine maleate has been shown to prolong both the gestation period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Amlodipine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether amlodipine is excreted in human milk .
In the absence of this information , it is recommended that nursing be discontinued while amlodipine is administered .
Pediatric Use The effect of amlodipine on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known .
Geriatric Use Clinical studies of amlodipine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase of AUC of approximately 40 to 60 % , and a lower initial dose may be required ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Amlodipine has been evaluated for safety in more than 11 , 000 patients in US and foreign clinical trials .
In general , treatment with amlodipine was well - tolerated at doses up to 10 mg daily .
Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with amlodipine were of mild or moderate severity .
In controlled clinical trials directly comparing amlodipine ( n = 1730 ) in doses up to 10 mg to placebo ( n = 1250 ) , discontinuation of amlodipine due to adverse reactions was required in only about 1 . 5 % of patients and was not significantly different from placebo ( about 1 % ) .
The most common side effects are headache and edema .
The incidence ( % ) of side effects which occurred in a dose related manner are found as follows : Adverse Event 2 . 5 mg N = 275 5 mg N = 296 10 mg N = 268 Placebo N = 520 Edema 1 . 8 3 . 0 10 . 8 0 . 6 Dizziness 1 . 1 3 . 4 3 . 4 1 . 5 Flushing 0 . 7 1 . 4 2 . 6 0 . 0 Palpitation 0 . 7 1 . 4 4 . 5 0 . 6 Other adverse experiences which were not clearly dose related but which were reported with an incidence greater than 1 . 0 % in placebo - controlled clinical trials include the following : Placebo - Controlled Studies AMLODIPINE ( % ) ( N = 1730 ) PLACEBO ( % ) ( N = 1250 ) Headache 7 . 3 7 . 8 Fatigue 4 . 5 2 . 8 Nausea 2 . 9 1 . 9 Abdominal pain 1 . 6 0 . 3 Somnolence 1 . 4 0 . 6 For several adverse experiences that appear to be drug and dose related , there was a greater incidence in women than men associated with amlodipine treatment as shown in the following table : Adverse Event AMLODIPINE PLACEBO Male = % ( N = 1218 ) Female = % ( N = 512 ) Male = % ( N = 914 ) Female = % ( N = 336 ) Edema 5 . 6 14 . 6 1 . 4 5 . 1 Flushing 1 . 5 4 . 5 0 . 3 0 . 9 Palpitations 1 . 4 3 . 3 0 . 9 0 . 9 Somnolence 1 . 3 1 . 6 0 . 8 0 . 3 The following events occurred in < 1 % but > 0 . 1 % of patients in controlled clinical trials or under conditions of open trials or marketing experience where a causal relationship is uncertain ; they are listed to alert the physician to a possible relationship : Cardiovascular : arrhythmia ( including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation ) , bradycardia , chest pain , hypotension , peripheral ischemia , syncope , tachycardia , postural dizziness , postural hypotension , vasculitis .

The following events occurred in < 0 . 1 % of patients : cardiac failure , pulse irregularity , extrasystoles , skin discoloration , urticaria , skin dryness , alopecia , dermatitis , muscle weakness , twitching , ataxia , hypertonia , migraine , cold and clammy skin , apathy , agitation , amnesia , gastritis , increased appetite , loose stools , coughing , rhinitis , dysuria , polyuria , parosmia , taste perversion , abnormal visual accommodation , and xerophthalmia .
Other reactions occurred sporadically and cannot be distinguished from medications or concurrent disease states such as myocardial infarction and angina .
Amlodipine therapy has not been associated with clinically significant changes in routine laboratory tests .
No clinically relevant changes were noted in serum potassium , serum glucose , total triglycerides , total cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , uric acid , blood urea nitrogen , or creatinine .
The following postmarketing event has been reported infrequently where a causal relationship is uncertain : gynecomastia .
In postmarketing experience , jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations ( mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis ) in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization have been reported in association with use of amlodipine .
Amlodipine has been used safely in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , well - compensated congestive heart failure , peripheral vascular disease , diabetes mellitus , and abnormal lipid profiles .
[ 1 ] These events occurred in less than 1 % in placebo - controlled trials , but the incidence of these side effects was between 1 % and 2 % in all multiple dose studies .
OVERDOSAGE Single oral doses of amlodipine maleate equivalent to 40 mg amlodipine / kg and 100 mg amlodipine / kg in mice and rats , respectively , caused deaths .
Single oral amlodipine maleate doses equivalent to 4 or more mg amlodipine / kg or higher in dogs ( 11 or more times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) caused a marked peripheral vasodilation and hypotension .
Overdosage might be expected to cause excessive peripheral vasodilation with marked hypotension and possibly a reflex tachycardia .
In humans , experience with intentional overdosage of amlodipine is limited .
Reports of intentional overdosage include a patient who ingested 250 mg and was asymptomatic and was not hospitalized ; another ( 120 mg ) was hospitalized , underwent gastric lavage and remained normotensive ; the third ( 105 mg ) was hospitalized and had hypotension ( 90 / 50 mmHg ) which normalized following plasma expansion .
A case of accidental drug overdose has been documented in a 19 - month - old male who ingested 30 mg amlodipine ( about 2 mg / kg ) .
During the emergency room presentation , vital signs were stable with no evidence of hypotension , but a heart rate of 180 bpm .
Ipecac was administered 3 . 5 hours after ingestion and on subsequent observation ( overnight ) no sequelae were noted .
If massive overdose should occur , active cardiac and respiratory monitoring should be instituted .
Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential .
Should hypotension occur , cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids should be initiated .
If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures , administration of vasopressors ( such as phenylephrine ) , should be considered with attention to circulating volume and urine output .
Intravenous calcium gluconate may help to reverse the effects of calcium entry blockade .
As amlodipine is highly protein bound , hemodialysis is not likely to be of benefit .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adults The usual initial antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine is 5 mg once daily with a maximum dose of 10 mg once daily .
Small , fragile , or elderly individuals , or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2 . 5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy .
Dosage should be adjusted according to each patient ' s need .
In general , titration should proceed over 7 to 14 days so that the physician can fully assess the patient ' s response to each dose level .
Titration may proceed more rapidly , however , if clinically warranted , provided the patient is assessed frequently .
The recommended dose for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5 to 10 mg , with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency .
Most patients will require 10 mg for adequate effect .
See ADVERSE REACTIONS section for information related to dosage and side effects .
Children The effective antihypertensive oral dose in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years is 2 . 5 mg to 5 mg once daily .
Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients .
See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY .
Coadministration with Other Antihypertensive and / or Antianginal Drugs Amlodipine has been safely administered with thiazides , ACE inhibitors , beta - blockers , long - acting nitrates , and / or sublingual nitroglycerin .

What is amlodipine besylate ?
Amlodipine besylate is a type of medicine known as a calcium channel blocker ( CCB ) .
It is used to treat high blood pressure ( hypertension ) and a type of chest pain called angina .
It can be used by itself or with other medicines to treat these conditions .
High Blood Pressure ( hypertension ) High blood pressure comes from blood pushing too hard against your blood vessels .
Amlodipine besylate relaxes your blood vessels which lets your blood flow more easily and helps lower your blood pressure .
Drugs that lower blood pressure lower your risk of having a stroke or heart attack .
Angina Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood .
Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain , usually in your chest under the breastbone .
