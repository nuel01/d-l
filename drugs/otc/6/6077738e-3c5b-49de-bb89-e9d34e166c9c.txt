4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Pregnancy ( Boxed Warning , 4 . 1 , 5 . 1 , 8 . 1 ) .
• Demonstrated severe hypersensitivity to lenalidomide ( 4 . 2 , 5 . 9 , 5 . 15 ) .
4 . 1 Pregnancy Lenalidomide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female .
Limb abnormalities were seen in the offspring of monkeys that were dosed with lenalidomide during organogenesis .
This effect was seen at all doses tested .
Due to the results of this developmental monkey study , and lenalidomide ' s structural similarities to thalidomide , a known human teratogen , lenalidomide is contraindicated in females who are pregnant [ see Boxed Warning ] .
If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) , Use in Special Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .
4 . 2 Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions Lenalidomide is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated severe hypersensitivity ( e . g . , angioedema , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis ) to lenalidomide [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 , 5 . 15 ) ] .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Increased Mortality : serious and fatal cardiac adverse reactions occurred in patients with CLL treated with lenalidomide ( 5 . 5 ) .
• Second Primary Malignancies ( SPM ) : Higher incidences of SPM were observed in controlled trials of patients with MM receiving lenalidomide ( 5 . 6 ) .
• Increased Mortality : Observed in patients with MM when pembrolizumab was added to dexamethasone and a thalidomide analogue ( 5 . 7 ) .
• Hepatotoxicity : Hepatic failure including fatalities ; monitor liver function .
Stop lenalidomide and evaluate if hepatotoxicity is suspected ( 5 . 8 ) .
• Severe Cutaneous Reactions : Discontinue lenalidomide for severe reactions ( 5 . 9 ) .
• Tumor lysis syndrome ( TLS ) including fatalities : Monitor patients at risk of TLS ( i . e . , those with high tumor burden ) and take appropriate precautions ( 5 . 10 ) .
• Tumor flare reaction : Serious tumor flare reactions , including fatal reactions , have occurred during investigational use of lenalidomide for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma ( 5 . 11 ) .
• Impaired Stem Cell mobilization : A decrease in the number of CD34 + cells collected after treatment ( > 4 cycles ) with lenalidomide has been reported .
Consider early referral to transplant center ( 5 . 12 ) .
• Hypersensitivity : Monitor patients for potential hypersensitivity .
Discontinue lenalidomide for angioedema and anaphylaxis ( 5 . 15 ) .
5 . 1 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Lenalidomide is a thalidomide analogue and is contraindicated for use during pregnancy .
Thalidomide is a known human teratogen that causes life - threatening human birth defects or embryo - fetal death [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
An embryo - fetal development study in monkeys indicates that lenalidomide produced malformations in the offspring of female monkeys who received the drug during pregnancy , similar to birth defects observed in humans following exposure to thalidomide during pregnancy .
Lenalidomide is only available through the Lenalidomide REMSprogram [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Females of Reproductive Potential Females of reproductive potential must avoid pregnancy for at least 4 weeks before beginning lenalidomide therapy , during therapy , during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy .
Females must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use two methods of reliable birth control , beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with lenalidomide , during therapy , during dose interruptions and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of lenalidomide therapy .
Two negative pregnancy tests must be obtained prior to initiating therapy .
The first test should be performed within 10 to 14 days and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide therapy and then weekly during the first month , then monthly thereafter in females with regular menstrual cycles or every 2 weeks in females with irregular menstrual cycles [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
Males Lenalidomide is present in the semen of patients receiving the drug .
Therefore , males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking lenalidomide and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing lenalidomide , even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy .
Male patients taking lenalidomide must not donate sperm and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing lenalidomide [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
Blood Donation Patients must not donate blood during treatment with lenalidomide and for 4 weeks following discontinuation of the drug because the blood might be given to a pregnant female patient whose fetus must not be exposed to lenalidomide .
5 . 2 Lenalidomide REMS Program Because of the embryo - fetal risk [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] , lenalidomide is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS ) , the Lenalidomide REMS Program .
Required components of the Lenalidomide REMS program include the following : • Prescribers must be certified with the Lenalidomide REMS program by enrolling and complying with the REMS requirements .
• Patients must sign a Patient - Physician agreement form and comply with the REMS requirements .
In particular , female patients of reproductive potential who are not pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] and males must comply with contraception requirements [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
• Pharmacies must be certified with the Lenalidomide REMS program , must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive lenalidomide and comply with REMS requirements .
Further information about the Lenalidomide REMS program is available at www . lenalidomiderems . com or by telephone at 1 - 888 - 423 - 5436 .
5 . 3 Hematologic Toxicity Lenalidomide can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia .
Monitor patients with neutropenia for signs of infection .
Advise patients to observe for bleeding or bruising , especially with use of concomitant medication that may increase risk of bleeding .
Patients taking lenalidomide should have their complete blood counts assessed periodically as described below [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor complete blood counts ( CBC ) in patients taking lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone for MM every 7 days ( weekly ) for the first 2 cycles , on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 3 , and every 28 days ( 4 weeks ) thereafter .
A dose interruption and / or dose reduction may be required [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 4 Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism Venous thromboembolic events ( VTE [ DVT and PE ] ) and arterial thromboembolic events ( ATE , myocardial infarction and stroke ) are increased in patients treated with lenalidomide .
A significantly increased risk of DVT ( 7 . 4 % ) and of PE ( 3 . 7 % ) occurred in patients with MM after at least one prior therapy who were treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone therapy compared to patients treated in the placebo and dexamethasone group ( 3 . 1 % and 0 . 9 % ) in clinical trials with varying use of anticoagulant therapies .
In the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma ( NDMM ) study in which nearly all patients received antithrombotic prophylaxis , DVT was reported as a serious adverse reaction ( 3 . 6 % , 2 . 0 % , and 1 . 7 % ) in the Rd Continuous , Rd18 , and MPT Arms , respectively .
The frequency of serious adverse reactions of PE was similar between the Rd Continuous , Rd18 , and MPT Arms ( 3 . 8 % , 2 . 8 % , and 3 . 7 % , respectively ) [ see Boxed Warning and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Myocardial infarction ( 1 . 7 % ) and stroke ( CVA ) ( 2 . 3 % ) are increased in patients with MM after at least one prior therapy who were treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone therapy compared to patients treated with placebo and dexamethasone ( 0 . 6 % , and 0 . 9 % ) in clinical trials .
In the NDMM study , myocardial infarction ( including acute ) was reported as a serious adverse reaction ( 2 . 3 % , 0 . 6 % , and 1 . 1 % ) in the Rd Continuous , Rd18 , and MPT Arms , respectively .
The frequency of serious adverse reactions of CVA was similar between the Rd Continuous , Rd18 , and MPT Arms ( 0 . 8 % , 0 . 6 % , and 0 . 6 % , respectively ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Patients with known risk factors , including prior thrombosis , may be at greater risk and actions should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable factors ( e . g . hyperlipidemia , hypertension , smoking ) .
In controlled clinical trials that did not use concomitant thromboprophylaxis , 21 . 5 % overall thrombotic events ( Standardized MedDRA Query Embolic and Thrombotic events ) occurred in patients with refractory and relapsed MM who were treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone compared to 8 . 3 % thrombosis in patients treated with placebo and dexamethasone .
The median time to first thrombosis event was 2 . 8 months .
In the NDMM study in which nearly all patients received antithrombotic prophylaxis , the overall frequency of thrombotic events was 17 . 4 % in patients in the combined Rd Continuous and Rd18 Arms , and was 11 . 6 % in the MPT Arm .
The median time to first thrombosis event was 4 . 3 months in the combined Rd Continuous and Rd18 Arms .
Thromboprophylaxis is recommended .
The regimen of thromboprophylaxis should be based on an assessment of the patient ' s underlying risks .
Instruct patients to report immediately any signs and symptoms suggestive of thrombotic events .
ESAs and estrogens may further increase the risk of thrombosis and their use should be based on a benefit - risk decision in patients receiving lenalidomide [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 5 Increased Mortality in Patients with CLL In a prospective randomized ( 1 : 1 ) clinical trial in the first line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia , single agent lenalidomide therapy increased the risk of death as compared to single agent chlorambucil .
In an interim analysis , there were 34 deaths among 210 patients on the lenalidomide treatment arm compared to 18 deaths among 211 patients in the chlorambucil treatment arm , and hazard ratio for overall survival was 1 . 92 [ 95 % CI : 1 . 08 to 3 . 41 ] , consistent with a 92 % increase in the risk of death .
The trial was halted for safety in July 2013 .
Serious adverse cardiovascular reactions , including atrial fibrillation , myocardial infarction , and cardiac failure occurred more frequently in the lenalidomide treatment arm .
Lenalidomide is not indicated and not recommended for use in CLL outside of controlled clinical trials .
5 . 6 Second Primary Malignancies In clinical trials in patients with MM receiving lenalidomide , an increase of hematologic plus solid tumor second primary malignancies ( SPM ) notably AML and MDS have been observed .
An increase in hematologic SPM including AML and MDS occurred in 5 . 3 % of patients with NDMM receiving lenalidomide in combination with oral melphalan compared with 1 . 3 % of patients receiving melphalan without lenalidomide .
The frequency of AML and MDS cases in patients with NDMM treated with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone without melphalan was 0 . 4 % .
In patients with relapsed or refractory MM treated with lenalidomide / dexamethasone , the incidence of hematologic plus solid tumor ( excluding squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma ) SPM was 2 . 3 % versus 0 . 6 % in the dexamethasone alone arm .
Non - melanoma skin cancer SPM , including squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma , occurred in 3 . 1 % of patients receiving lenalidomide / dexamethasone , compared to 0 . 6 % in the dexamethasone alone arm .
Patients who received lenalidomide - containing therapy until disease progression did not show a higher incidence of invasive SPM than patients treated in the fixed duration lenalidomide - containing arms .
Monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies .
Take into account both the potential benefit of lenalidomide and the risk of second primary malignancies when considering treatment with lenalidomide .
5 . 7 Increased Mortality in Patients with MM When Pembrolizumab Is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone In two randomized clinical trials in patients with MM , the addition of pembrolizumab to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone , a use for which no PD - 1 or PD - L1 blocking antibody is indicated , resulted in increased mortality .
Treatment of patients with MM with a PD - 1 or PD - L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials .
5 . 8 Hepatotoxicity Hepatic failure , including fatal cases , has occurred in patients treated with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone .
In clinical trials , 15 % of patients experienced hepatotoxicity ( with hepatocellular , cholestatic and mixed characteristics ) ; 2 % of patients with MM had serious hepatotoxicity events .
The mechanism of drug - induced hepatotoxicity is unknown .
Pre - existing viral liver disease , elevated baseline liver enzymes , and concomitant medications may be risk factors .
Monitor liver enzymes periodically .
Stop lenalidomide upon elevation of liver enzymes .
After return to baseline values , treatment at a lower dose may be considered .
5 . 9 Severe Cutaneous Reactions Severe cutaneous reactions including Stevens - Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) , toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) have been reported .
DRESS may present with a cutaneous reaction ( such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis ) , eosinophilia , fever , and / or lymphadenopathy with systemic complications such as hepatitis , nephritis , pneumonitis , myocarditis , and / or pericarditis .
These events can be fatal .
Patients with a prior history of Grade 4 rash associated with thalidomide treatment should not receive lenalidomide .
Consider lenalidomide interruption or discontinuation for Grade 2 - 3 skin rash .
Permanently discontinue lenalidomide for Grade 4 rash , exfoliative or bullous rash , or for other severe cutaneous reactions such as SJS , TEN or DRESS [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
5 . 10 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Fatal instances of tumor lysis syndrome ( TLS ) have been reported during treatment with lenalidomide .
The patients at risk of TLS are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment .
Monitor patients at risk closely and take appropriate preventive approaches .
5 . 11 Tumor Flare Reaction Tumor flare reaction ( TFR ) , including fatal reactions , have occurred during investigational use of lenalidomide for CLL and lymphoma , and is characterized by tender lymph node swelling , low grade fever , pain and rash .
Lenalidomide is not indicated and not recommended for use in CLL outside of controlled clinical trials .
Tumor flare reaction may mimic progression of disease ( PD ) .
5 . 12 Impaired Stem Cell Mobilization A decrease in the number of CD34 + cells collected after treatment ( > 4 cycles ) with lenalidomide has been reported .
In patients who received more than 4 cycles of a lenalidomide - containing treatment or for whom inadequate numbers of CD 34 + cells have been collected with G - CSF alone , G - CSF with cyclophosphamide or the combination of G - CSF with a CXCR4 inhibitor may be considered .
5 . 13 Thyroid Disorders Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have been reported [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Measure thyroid function before start of lenalidomide treatment and during therapy .
5 . 15 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity , including angioedema , anaphylaxis , and anaphylactic reactions to lenalidomide has been reported .
Permanently discontinue lenalidomide for angioedema and anaphylaxis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Newly Diagnosed MM - Lenalidomide Combination Therapy : Data were evaluated from 1613 patients in a large phase 3 study who received at least one dose of lenalidomide with low dose dexamethasone ( Rd ) given for 2 different durations of time ( i . e . , until progressive disease [ Arm Rd Continuous ; N = 532 ] or for up to eighteen 28 - day cycles [ 72 weeks , Arm Rd18 ; N = 540 ] or who received melphalan , prednisone and thalidomide ( Arm MPT ; N = 541 ) for a maximum of twelve 42 - day cycles ( 72 weeks ) .
The median treatment duration in the Rd Continuous arm was 80 . 2 weeks ( range 0 . 7 to 246 . 7 ) or 18 . 4 months ( range 0 . 16 to 56 . 7 ) .
In general , the most frequently reported adverse reactions were comparable in Arm Rd Continuous and Arm Rd18 , and included diarrhea , anemia , constipation , peripheral edema , neutropenia , fatigue , back pain , nausea , asthenia , and insomnia .
The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 reactions included neutropenia , anemia , thrombocytopenia , pneumonia , asthenia , fatigue , back pain , hypokalemia , rash , cataract , lymphopenia , dyspnea , DVT , hyperglycemia , and leukopenia .
The highest frequency of infections occurred in Arm Rd Continuous ( 75 % ) compared to Arm MPT ( 56 % ) .
There were more grade 3 and 4 and serious adverse reactions of infection in Arm Rd Continuous than either Arm MPT or Rd18 .
In the Rd Continuous arm , the most common adverse reactions leading to dose interruption of lenalidomide were infection events ( 28 . 8 % ) ; overall , the median time to the first dose interruption of lenalidomide was 7 weeks .
The most common adverse reactions leading to dose reduction of lenalidomide in the Rd Continuous arm were hematologic events ( 10 . 7 % ) ; overall , the median time to the first dose reduction of lenalidomide was 16 weeks .
In the Rd Continuous arm , the most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of lenalidomide were infection events ( 3 . 4 % ) .
In both Rd arms , the frequencies of onset of adverse reactions were generally highest in the first 6 months of treatment and then the frequencies decreased over time or remained stable throughout treatment , except for cataracts .
The frequency of onset of cataracts increased over time with 0 . 7 % during the first 6 months and up to 9 . 6 % by the 2 nd year of treatment with Rd Continuous .

Other Adverse Reactions : After At Least One Prior Therapy for MM In these 2 studies , the following adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) not described above that occurred at ≥ 1 % rate and of at least twice of the placebo percentage rate were reported : Blood and lymphatic system disorders : pancytopenia , autoimmune hemolytic anemia Cardiac disorders : bradycardia , myocardial infarction , angina pectoris Endocrine disorders : hirsutism Eye disorders : blindness , ocular hypertension Gastrointestinal disorders : gastrointestinal hemorrhage , glossodynia General disorders and administration site conditions : malaise Investigations : liver function tests abnormal , alanine aminotransferase increased Nervous system disorders : cerebral ischemia Psychiatric disorders : mood swings , hallucination , loss of libido Reproductive system and breast disorders : erectile dysfunction Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders : cough , hoarseness Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : exanthem , skin hyperpigmentation 6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse drug reactions have been identified from the worldwide post - marketing experience with lenalidomide .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure [ see Warnings and Precautions Section ( 5 . 8 to 5 . 11 and 5 . 13 ) ] Endocrine disorders : Hypothyroidism , hyperthyroidism Hepatobiliary disorders : Hepatic failure ( including fatality ) , toxic hepatitis , cytolytic hepatitis , cholestatic hepatitis , mixed cytolytic / cholestatic hepatitis , transient abnormal liver laboratory tests Immune system disorders : Angioedema , anaphylaxis , acute graft - versus - host disease ( following allogeneic hematopoietic transplant ) , solid organ transplant rejection Infections and infestations : Viral reactivation ( such as hepatitis B virus and herpes zoster ) , progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) Neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( including cysts and polyps ) : Tumor lysis syndrome , tumor flare reaction Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders : Pneumonitis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Stevens - Johnson Syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis , drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Digoxin : Monitor digoxin plasma levels periodically due to increased Cmaxand AUC with concomitant lenalidomide therapy ( 7 . 1 ) .
• Concomitant use of erythropoietin stimulating agents or estrogen containing therapies with lenalidomide may increase the risk of thrombosis ( 7 . 2 ) .
7 . 1 Digoxin When digoxin was co - administered with multiple doses of lenalidomide ( 10 mg / day ) the digoxin Cmax and AUCinf were increased by 14 % .
Periodically monitor digoxin plasma levels , in accordance with clinical judgment and based on standard clinical practice in patients receiving this medication , during administration of lenalidomide .
7 . 2 Concomitant Therapies That May Increase the Risk of Thrombosis Erythropoietic agents , or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis , such as estrogen containing therapies , should be used with caution after making a benefit - risk assessment in patients receiving lenalidomide [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
7 . 3 Warfarin Co - administration of multiple doses of lenalidomide ( 10 mg / day ) with a single dose of warfarin ( 25 mg ) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide or R - and S - warfarin .
Expected changes in laboratory assessments of PT and INR were observed after warfarin administration , but these changes were not affected by concomitant lenalidomide administration .
It is not known whether there is an interaction between dexamethasone and warfarin .
Close monitoring of PT and INR is recommended in patients with MM taking concomitant warfarin .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed ( 8 . 2 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in females exposed to lenalidomide during pregnancy as well as female partners of male patients who are exposed to lenalidomide .
This registry is also used to understand the root cause for the pregnancy .
Report any suspected fetal exposure to lenalidomide to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 and also to the REMS Call Center at 18884235436 .
Risk Summary Based on the mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] and findings from animal studies [ see Data ] , lenalidomide can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy [ see Boxed Warning , Contraindications ( 4 . 1 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Lenalidomide is a thalidomide analogue .
Thalidomide is a human teratogen , inducing a high frequency of severe and life - threatening birth defects such as amelia ( absence of limbs ) , phocomelia ( short limbs ) , hypoplasticity of the bones , absence of bones , external ear abnormalities ( including anotia , micropinna , small or absent external auditory canals ) , facial palsy , eye abnormalities ( anophthalmos , microphthalmos ) , and congenital heart defects .
Alimentary tract , urinary tract , and genital malformations have also been documented and mortality at or shortly after birth has been reported in about 40 % of infants .
Lenalidomide caused thalidomide - type limb defects in monkey offspring .
Lenalidomide crossed the placenta after administration to pregnant rabbits and pregnant rats [ see Data ] .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus .
If pregnancy does occur during treatment , immediately discontinue the drug .
Under these conditions , refer patient to an obstetrician / gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling .
Report any suspected fetal exposure to lenalidomide to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 and also to REMS Call Center at 18884235436 .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
The estimated background risk in the U . S . general population of major birth defects is 2 % to 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 % to 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
Data Animal data In an embryo - fetal developmental toxicity study in monkeys , teratogenicity , including thalidomide - like limb defects , occurred in offspring when pregnant monkeys received oral lenalidomide during organogenesis .
Exposure ( AUC ) in monkeys at the lowest dose was 0 . 17 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 25 mg .
Similar studies in pregnant rabbits and rats at 20 times and 200 times the MRHD respectively , produced embryo lethality in rabbits and no adverse reproductive effects in rats .
In a pre - and post - natal development study in rats , animals received lenalidomide from organogenesis through lactation .
The study revealed a few adverse effects on the offspring of female rats treated with lenalidomide at doses up to 500 mg / kg ( approximately 200 times the human dose of 25 mg based on body surface area ) .
The male offspring exhibited slightly delayed sexual maturation and the female offspring had slightly lower body weight gains during gestation when bred to male offspring .
As with thalidomide , the rat model may not adequately address the full spectrum of potential human embryo - fetal developmental effects for lenalidomide .
Following daily oral administration of lenalidomide from Gestation Day 7 through Gestation Day 20 in pregnant rabbits , fetal plasma lenalidomide concentrations were approximately 20 - 40 % of the maternal Cmax .
Following a single oral dose to pregnant rats , lenalidomide was detected in fetal plasma and tissues ; concentrations of radioactivity in fetal tissues were generally lower than those in maternal tissues .
These data indicated that lenalidomide crossed the placenta .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of lenalidomide in human milk , the effects of lenalidomide on the breastfed child , or the effects of lenalidomide on milk production .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in breastfed children from lenalidomide , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with lenalidomide .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Lenalidomide can cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating lenalidomide therapy and during therapy .
Advise females of reproductive potential that they must avoid pregnancy 4 weeks before therapy , while taking lenalidomide , during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy .
Females of reproductive potential must have 2 negative pregnancy tests before initiating lenalidomide .
The first test should be performed within 10 - 14 days , and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide .
Once treatment has started and during dose interruptions , pregnancy testing for females of reproductive potential should occur weekly during the first 4 weeks of use , then pregnancy testing should be repeated every 4 weeks in females with regular menstrual cycles .
If menstrual cycles are irregular , the pregnancy testing should occur every 2 weeks .
Pregnancy testing and counseling should be performed if a patient misses her period or if there is any abnormality in her menstrual bleeding .
Lenalidomide treatment must be discontinued during this evaluation .
Contraception Females Females of reproductive potential must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control simultaneously : one highly effective form of contraception – tubal ligation , IUD , hormonal ( birth control pills , injections , hormonal patches , vaginal rings , or implants ) , or partner ' s vasectomy , and 1 additional effective contraceptive method – male latex or synthetic condom , diaphragm , or cervical cap .
Contraception must begin 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with lenalidomide , during therapy , during dose interruptions , and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of lenalidomide therapy .
Reliable contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of infertility , unless due to hysterectomy .
Females of reproductive potential should be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods , if needed .
Males Lenalidomide is present in the semen of males who take lenalidomide .
Therefore , males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking lenalidomide and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing lenalidomide , even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy .
Male patients taking lenalidomide must not donate sperm and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing lenalidomide .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use MM In Combination : Overall , of the 1613 patients in the NDMM study who received study treatment , 94 % ( 1521 / 1613 ) were 65 years of age or older , while 35 % ( 561 / 1613 ) were over 75 years of age .
The percentage of patients over age 75 was similar between study arms ( Rd Continuous : 33 % ; Rd18 : 34 % ; MPT : 33 % ) .
Overall , across all treatment arms , the frequency in most of the adverse reaction categories ( e . g . , all adverse reactions , grade 3 / 4 adverse reactions , serious adverse reactions ) was higher in older ( > 75 years of age ) than in younger ( ≤ 75 years of age ) subjects .
Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions in the General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions body system were consistently reported at a higher frequency ( with a difference of at least 5 % ) in older subjects than in younger subjects across all treatment arms .
Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions in the Infections and Infestations , Cardiac Disorders ( including cardiac failure and congestive cardiac failure ) , Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders , and Renal and Urinary Disorders ( including renal failure ) body systems were also reported slightly , but consistently , more frequently ( < 5 % difference ) , in older subjects than in younger subjects across all treatment arms .
For other body systems ( e . g . , Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders , Infections and Infestations , Cardiac Disorders , Vascular Disorders ) , there was a less consistent trend for increased frequency of grade 3 / 4 adverse reactions in older vs younger subjects across all treatment arms Serious adverse reactions were generally reported at a higher frequency in the older subjects than in the younger subjects across all treatment arms .
MM After At Least One Prior Therapy Of the 703 MM patients who received study treatment in Studies 1 and 2 , 45 % were age 65 or over while 12 % of patients were age 75 and over .
The percentage of patients age 65 or over was not significantly different between the lenalidomide / dexamethasone and placebo / dexamethasone groups .
Of the 353 patients who received lenalidomide / dexamethasone , 46 % were age 65 and over .
In both studies , patients > 65 years of age were more likely than patients ≤ 65 years of age to experience DVT , pulmonary embolism , atrial fibrillation , and renal failure following use of lenalidomide .
No differences in efficacy were observed between patients over 65 years of age and younger patients .
Since elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection .
Monitor renal function .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Adjust the starting dose of lenalidomide based on the creatinine clearance value and for patients on dialysis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no specific experience in the management of lenalidomide overdose in patients with MM .
In dose - ranging studies in healthy subjects , some were exposed to up to 200 mg ( administered 100 mg BID ) and in single - dose studies , some subjects were exposed to up to 400 mg .
Pruritus , urticaria , rash , and elevated liver transaminases were the primary reported AEs .
In clinical trials , the dose - limiting toxicity was neutropenia and thrombocytopenia .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Lenalidomide is an analogue of thalidomide with immunomodulatory , antiangiogenic , and antineoplastic properties .
Cellular activities of lenalidomide are mediated through its target cereblon , a component of a cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme complex .
In vitro , in the presence of drug , substrate proteins ( including Aiolos , Ikaros , and CK1α ) are targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation leading to direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects .
Lenalidomide inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of certain hematopoietic tumor cells including MM in vitro .
Lenalidomide causes a delay in tumor growth in some in vivo nonclinical hematopoietic tumor models including MM .
Immunomodulatory properties of lenalidomide include increased number and activation of T cells and natural killer ( NK ) cells leading to direct and enhanced antibody - dependent cell - mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) via increased secretion of interleukin - 2 and interferon - gamma , increased numbers of NKT cells , and inhibition of pro - inflammatory cytokines ( e . g . , TNF - α and IL - 6 ) by monocytes .
In MM cells , the combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone synergizes the inhibition of cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of lenalidomide on the QTc interval was evaluated in 60 healthy male subjects in a thorough QT study .
At a dose two times the maximum recommended dose , lenalidomide did not prolong the QTc interval .
The largest upper bound of the two - sided 90 % CI for the mean differences between lenalidomide and placebo was below 10 ms . 12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following single and multiple doses of lenalidomide in patients with MM the maximum plasma concentrations occurred between 0 . 5 and 6 hours post - dose .
The single and multiple dose pharmacokinetic disposition of lenalidomide is linear with AUC and Cmax values increasing proportionally with dose .
Multiple doses of lenalidomide at the recommended dosage does not result in drug accumulation .
Administration of a single 25 mg dose of lenalidomide with a high - fat meal in healthy subjects reduces the extent of absorption , with an approximate 20 % decrease in AUC and 50 % decrease in Cmax .
In the trials where the efficacy and safety were established for lenalidomide , the drug was administered without regard to food intake .
Lenalidomide can be administered with or without food .
Distribution In vitro [ 14 C ] - lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins is approximately 30 % .
Lenalidomide is present in semen at 2 hours ( 1379 ng / ejaculate ) and 24 hours ( 35 ng / ejaculate ) after the administration of lenalidomide 25 mg daily .
Elimination The mean half - life of lenalidomide is 3 hours in healthy subjects and 3 to 5 hours in patients with MM .
Metabolism Lenalidomide undergoes limited metabolism .
Unchanged lenalidomide is the predominant circulating component in humans .
Two identified metabolites are 5 hydroxy - lenalidomide and N - acetyl - lenalidomide ; each constitutes less than 5 % of parent levels in circulation .
Excretion Elimination is primarily renal .
Following a single oral administration of [ 14 C ] - lenalidomide 25 mg to healthy subjects , approximately 90 % and 4 % of the radioactive dose was eliminated within ten days in urine and feces , respectively .
Approximately 82 % of the radioactive dose was excreted as lenalidomide in the urine within 24 hours .
Hydroxy - lenalidomide and N - acetyl - lenalidomide represented 4 . 6 % and 1 . 8 % of the excreted dose , respectively .
The renal clearance of lenalidomide exceeds the glomerular filtration rate .
Specific Populations Renal Impairment : Eight subjects with mild renal impairment ( creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) 50 to 79 mL / min calculated using Cockcroft - Gault ) , 9 subjects with moderate renal impairment ( CLcr 30 to 49 mL / min ) , 4 subjects with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) , and 6 patients with end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) requiring dialysis were administered a single 25 mg dose of lenalidomide .
Three healthy subjects of similar age with normal renal function ( CLcr > 80 mL / min ) were also administered a single 25 mg dose of lenalidomide .
As CLcr decreased , half - life increased and drug clearance decreased linearly .
Patients with moderate and severe impairment had a 3 - fold increase in half - life and a 66 % to 75 % decrease in drug clearance compared to healthy subjects .
Patients on hemodialysis ( n = 6 ) had an approximate 4 . 5 - fold increase in half - life and an 80 % decrease in drug clearance compared to healthy subjects .
Approximately 30 % of the drug in body was removed during a 4 - hour hemodialysis session .
Adjust the starting dose of lenalidomide in patients with renal impairment based on the CLcr value [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
Hepatic Impairment : Mild hepatic impairment ( defined as total bilirubin > 1 to 1 . 5 times upper limit normal ( ULN ) or any aspartate transaminase greater than ULN ) did not influence the disposition of lenalidomide .
No pharmacokinetic data is available for patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment .
Other Intrinsic Factors : Age ( 39 to 85 years ) , body weight ( 33 to 135 kg ) , sex , race , and type of hematological malignancy ( MM ) did not have a clinically relevant effect on lenalidomide clearance in adult patients .
Drug Interactions Co - administration of a single dose or multiple doses of dexamethasone ( 40 mg ) had no clinically relevant effect on the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide ( 25 mg ) .
Co - administration of lenalidomide ( 25 mg ) after multiple doses of a P - gp inhibitor such as quinidine ( 600 mg twice daily ) did not significantly increase the Cmax or AUC of lenalidomide .
Co - administration of the P - gp inhibitor and substrate temsirolimus ( 25 mg ) , with lenalidomide ( 25 mg ) did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide , temsirolimus , or sirolimus ( metabolite of temsirolimus ) .
In vitro studies demonstrated that lenalidomide is a substrate of P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) .
Lenalidomide is not a substrate of human breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) , multidrug resistance protein ( MRP ) transporters MRP1 , MRP2 , or MRP3 , organic anion transporters ( OAT ) OAT1 and OAT3 , organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 ( OATP1B1 ) , organic cation transporters ( OCT ) OCT1 and OCT2 , multidrug and toxin extrusion protein ( MATE ) MATE1 , and organic cation transporters novel ( OCTN ) OCTN1 and OCTN2 .
Lenalidomide is not an inhibitor of P - gp , bile salt export pump ( BSEP ) , BCRP , MRP2 , OAT1 , OAT3 , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , or OCT2 .
Lenalidomide does not inhibit or induce CYP450 isoenzymes .
Also , lenalidomide does not inhibit bilirubin glucuronidation formation in human liver microsomes with UGT1A1 genotyped as UGT1A1 * 1 / * 1 , UGT1A1 * 1 / * 28 , and UGT1A1 * 28 / * 28 .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with lenalidomide have not been conducted .
Lenalidomide was not mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay ( Ames test ) and did not induce chromosome aberrations in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes , or mutations at the thymidine kinase ( tk ) locus of mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells .
Lenalidomide did not increase morphological transformation in Syrian Hamster Embryo assay or induce micronuclei in the polychromatic erythrocytes of the bone marrow of male rats .
A fertility and early embryonic development study in rats , with administration of lenalidomide up to 500 mg / kg ( approximately 200 times the human dose of 25 mg , based on body surface area ) produced no parental toxicity and no adverse effects on fertility .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Multiple Myeloma Randomized , Open - Label Clinical Trial in Patients with Newly Diagnosed MM A randomized multicenter , open - label , 3 - arm trial of 1 , 623 patients , was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide and low - dose dexamethasone ( Rd ) given for 2 different durations of time to that of melphalan , prednisone and thalidomide ( MPT ) in newly diagnosed MM patients who were not a candidate for stem cell transplant .
In the first arm of the study , Rd was given continuously until progressive disease [ Arm Rd Continuous ] .
In the second arm , Rd was given for up to eighteen 28 - day cycles [ 72 weeks , Arm Rd18 ] ) .
In the third arm , melphalan , prednisone and thalidomide ( MPT ) was given for a maximum of twelve 42 - day cycles ( 72 weeks ) .
For the purposes of this study , a patient who was < 65 years of age was not a candidate for SCT if the patient refused to undergo SCT therapy or the patient did not have access to SCT due to cost or other reasons .
Patients were stratified at randomization by age ( ≤ 75 versus > 75 years ) , stage ( ISS Stages I and II versus Stage III ) , and country .
Patients in the Rd Continuous and Rd18 arms received lenalidomide 25 mg once daily on Days 1 to 21 of 28 - day cycles .
Dexamethasone was dosed 40 mg once daily on Days 1 , 8 , 15 , and 22 of each 28 - day cycle .
For patients over > 75 years old , the starting dose of dexamethasone was 20 mg orally once daily on days 1 , 8 , 15 , and 22 of repeated 28 - day cycles .
Initial dose and regimens for Rd Continuous and Rd18 were adjusted according to age and renal function .
All patients received prophylactic anticoagulation with the most commonly used being aspirin .
The demographics and disease - related baseline characteristics of the patients were balanced among the 3 arms .
In general , study subjects had advanced - stage disease .
Of the total study population , the median age was 73 in the 3 arms with 35 % of total patients > 75 years of age ; 59 % had ISS Stage I / II ; 41 % had ISS stage III ; 9 % had severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance [ CLcr ] < 30 mL / min ) ; 23 % had moderate renal impairment ( CLcr > 30 to 50 mL / min ; 44 % had mild renal impairment ( CLcr > 50 to 80 mL / min ) .
For ECOG Performance Status , 29 % were Grade 0 , 49 % Grade 1 , 21 % Grade 2 , 0 . 4 % ≥ Grade 3 .
The primary efficacy endpoint , progression - free survival ( PFS ) , was defined as the time from randomization to the first documentation of disease progression as determined by Independent Response Adjudication Committee ( IRAC ) , based on International Myeloma Working Group [ IMWG ] criteria or death due to any cause , whichever occurred first during the study until the end of the PFS follow - up phase .
For the efficacy analysis of all endpoints , the primary comparison was between Rd Continuous and MPT arms .
The efficacy results are summarized in the table below .
PFS was significantly longer with Rd Continuous than MPT : HR 0 . 72 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 61 - 0 . 85 p < 0 . 0001 ) .
A lower percentage of subjects in the Rd Continuous arm compared with the MPT arm had PFS events ( 52 % versus 61 % , respectively ) .
The improvement in median PFS time in the Rd Continuous arm compared with the MPT arm was 4 . 3 months .
The myeloma response rate was higher with Rd Continuous compared with MPT ( 75 . 1 % versus 62 . 3 % ) ; with a complete response in 15 . 1 % of Rd Continuous arm patients versus 9 . 3 % in the MPT arm .
The median time to first response was 1 . 8 months in the Rd Continuous arm versus 2 . 8 months in the MPT arm .
For the interim OS analysis with 03 March 2014 data cutoff , the median follow - up time for all surviving patients is 45 . 5 months , with 697 death events , representing 78 % of prespecified events required for the planned final OS analysis ( 697 / 896 of the final OS events ) .
The observed OS HR was 0 . 75 for Rd Continuous versus MPT ( 95 % CI = 0 . 62 , 0 . 90 ) .

Randomized , Open - Label Clinical Studies in Patients with MM After At Least One Prior Therapy Two randomized studies ( Studies 1 and 2 ) were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide .
These multicenter , multinational , double - blind , placebo - controlled studies compared lenalidomide plus oral pulse high - dose dexamethasone therapy to dexamethasone therapy alone in patients with MM who had received at least one prior treatment .
These studies enrolled patients with absolute neutrophil counts ( ANC ) ≥ 1000 / mm3 , platelet counts ≥ 75 , 000 / mm3 , serum creatinine ≤ 2 . 5 mg / dL , serum SGOT / AST or SGPT / ALT ≤ 3 x upper limit of normal ( ULN ) , and serum direct bilirubin ≤ 2 mg / dL .
In both studies , patients in the lenalidomide / dexamethasone group took 25 mg of lenalidomide orally once daily on Days 1 to 21 and a matching placebo capsule once daily on Days 22 to 28 of each 28 - day cycle .
Patients in the placebo / dexamethasone group took 1 placebo capsule on Days 1 to 28 of each 28 - day cycle .
Patients in both treatment groups took 40 mg of dexamethasone orally once daily on Days 1 to 4 , 9 to 12 , and 17 to 20 of each 28 - day cycle for the first 4 cycles of therapy .
The dose of dexamethasone was reduced to 40 mg orally once daily on Days 1 to 4 of each 28 - day cycle after the first 4 cycles of therapy .
In both studies , treatment was to continue until disease progression .
In both studies , dose adjustments were allowed based on clinical and laboratory findings .
Sequential dose reductions to 15 mg daily , 10 mg daily and 5 mg daily were allowed for toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Table 16 summarizes the baseline patient and disease characteristics in the two studies .
In both studies , baseline demographic and disease - related characteristics were comparable between the lenalidomide / dexamethasone and placebo / dexamethasone groups .

TTP was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of progressive disease .
Preplanned interim analyses of both studies showed that the combination of lenalidomide / dexamethasone was significantly superior to dexamethasone alone for TTP .
The studies were unblinded to allow patients in the placebo / dexamethasone group to receive treatment with the lenalidomide / dexamethasone combination .
For both studies , the extended follow - up survival data with crossovers were analyzed .
In study 1 , the median survival time was 39 . 4 months ( 95 % CI : 32 . 9 , 47 . 4 ) in lenalidomide / dexamethasone group and 31 . 6 months ( 95 % CI : 24 . 1 , 40 . 9 ) in placebo / dexamethasone group , with a hazard ratio of 0 . 79 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 61 to 1 . 03 ) .
