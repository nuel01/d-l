Warnings and Precautions , Proteinuria and Nephrotic Syndrome ( 5 . 11 ) 3 / 2018 Warnings and Precautions , Embryo - Fetal Toxicity ( 5 . 15 ) 3 / 2018 1 INDICATIONS & USAGE Temsirolimus injection is indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma .
Temsirolimus injection is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION • The recommended dose of Temsirolimus injection is 25 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over a 30 - 60 minute period once a week .
Treat until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
( 2 . 1 ) • Antihistamine pre - treatment is recommended .
( 2 . 2 ) • Dose reduction is required in patients with mild hepatic impairment .
( 2 . 4 ) • Temsirolimus injection vial contents must first be diluted with the enclosed diluent before diluting the resultant solution with 250 mL of 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection .
( 2 . 5 ) 2 . 1 Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma The recommended dose of Temsirolimus injection for advanced renal cell carcinoma is 25 mg administered as an intravenous infusion over a 30 – 60 minute period once a week .
Treatment should continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs .
2 . 2 Premedication Patients should receive prophylactic intravenous diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg ( or similar antihistamine ) approximately 30 minutes before the start of each dose of Temsirolimus injection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 3 Dosage Interruption / Adjustment Temsirolimus injection should be held for absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) < 1 , 000 / mm3 , platelet count < 75 , 000 / mm3 , or NCI CTCAE grade 3 or greater adverse reactions .
Once toxicities have resolved to grade 2 or less , Temsirolimus injection may be restarted with the dose reduced by 5 mg / week to a dose no lower than 15 mg / week .
2 . 4 Dose Modification Guidelines Hepatic Impairment : Use caution when treating patients with hepatic impairment .
If Temsirolimus injection must be given in patients with mild hepatic impairment ( bilirubin > 1 – 1 . 5 × ULN or AST > ULN but bilirubin ≤ ULN ) , reduce the dose of Temsirolimus injection to 15 mg / week .
Temsirolimus injection is contraindicated in patients with bilirubin > 1 . 5 × ULN [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Concomitant Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors : The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided ( e . g . ketoconazole , itraconazole , clarithromycin , atazanavir , indinavir , nefazodone , nelfinavir , ritonavir , saquinavir , telithromycin , and voriconazole ) .
Grapefruit juice may also increase plasma concentrations of sirolimus ( a major metabolite of temsirolimus ) and should be avoided .
If patients must be co - administered a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor , based on pharmacokinetic studies , a Temsirolimus injection dose reduction to 12 . 5 mg / week should be considered .
This dose of Temsirolimus injection is predicted to adjust the AUC to the range observed without inhibitors .
However , there are no clinical data with this dose adjustment in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors .
If the strong inhibitor is discontinued , a washout period of approximately 1 week should be allowed before the Temsirolimus injection dose is adjusted back to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 12 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] Concomitant Strong CYP3A4 Inducers : The use of concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided ( e . g . dexamethasone , phenytoin , carbamazepine , rifampin , rifabutin , rifampacin , phenobarbital ) .
If patients must be co - administered a strong CYP3A4 inducer , based on pharmacokinetic studies , a Temsirolimus injection dose increase from 25 mg / week up to 50 mg / week should be considered .
This dose of Temsirolimus injection is predicted to adjust the AUC to the range observed without inducers .
However , there are no clinical data with this dose adjustment in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inducers .
If the strong inducer is discontinued the temsirolimus dose should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4 inducer [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 12 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 5 Instructions for Preparation Temsirolimus injection is a cytotoxic drug .
Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures1 .
Temsirolimus injection must be stored under refrigeration at 2 ° to 8 ° C ( 36 ° – 46 ° F ) and protected from light .
During handling and preparation of admixtures , Temsirolimus injection should be protected from excessive room light and sunlight .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
In order to minimize the patient exposure to the plasticizer DEHP ( di - 2 - ethylhexyl phthalate ) , which may be leached from PVC infusion bags or sets , the final Temsirolimus injection dilution for infusion should be stored in bottles ( glass , polypropylene ) or plastic bags ( polypropylene , polyolefin ) and administered through polyethylene - lined administration sets .
Temsirolimus injection 25 mg / mL injection must be diluted with the supplied diluent before further dilution in 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP .
Please note that both the Temsirolimus injection and diluent vials contain an overfill to ensure the recommended volume can be withdrawn .
Follow this two - step dilution process in an aseptic manner .
Step 1 : DILUTION OF TEMSIROLIMUS INJECTION 25 MG / ML WITH SUPPLIED DILUENT • Each Vial of Temsirolimus injection must first be mixed with 1 . 8 mL of the enclosed diluent .
The resultant solution contains 30 mg / 3 mL ( 10 mg / mL ) .
• Mix well by inversion of the vial .
Allow sufficient time for the air bubbles to subside .
The solution should be clear to slightly turbid , colorless to light - yellow solution , essentially free from visual particulates .
The concentrate - diluent mixture is stable below 25ºC for up to 24 hours .
Step 2 : DILUTION OF CONCENTRATE - DILUENT MIXTURE WITH 0 . 9 % SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION , USP • Withdraw precisely the required amount of concentrate - diluent mixture containing temsirolimus 10 mg / mL as prepared in Step 1 from the vial ( i . e . , 2 . 5 mL for a temsirolimus dose of 25 mg ) and further dilute into an infusion bag containing 250 mL of 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP .
• Mix by inversion of the bag or bottle , avoiding excessive shaking , as this may cause foaming .
The resulting solution should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration .
The admixture of Temsirolimus injection in 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP should be protected from excessive room light and sunlight 2 . 6 Administration • Administration of the final diluted solution should be completed within six hours from the time that Temsirolimus injection is first added to 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP .
• Temsirolimus injection is administered as an intravenous infusion over a 30 - to 60 - minute period once weekly .
The use of an infusion pump is the preferred method of administration to ensure accurate delivery of the product .
• Appropriate administration materials should be composed of glass , polyolefin , or polyethylene to avoid excessive loss of product and diethylhexylpthalate ( DEHP ) extraction .
The administration materials should consist of non - DEHP , non - polyvinylchloride ( PVC ) tubing with appropriate filter .
In the case when a PVC administration set has to be used , it should not contain DEHP .
An in - line polyethersulfone filter with a pore size of not greater than 5 microns is recommended for administration to avoid the possibility of particles bigger than 5 microns being infused .
If the administration set available does not have an in - line filter incorporated , a polyethersulfone filter should be added at the set ( i . e . , an end - filter ) before the admixture reaches the vein of the patient .
Different end - filters can be used , ranging in filter pore size from 0 . 2 microns up to 5 microns .
The use of both an in - line and end - filter is not recommended .
• Temsirolimus injection , when diluted , contains polysorbate 80 , which is known to increase the rate of DEHP extraction from PVC .
This should be considered during the preparation and administration of Temsirolimus injection , including storage time elapsed when in direct contact with PVC following constitution .
Compatibilities and Incompatibilities Undiluted Temsirolimus injection should not be added directly to aqueous infusion solutions .
Direct addition of Temsirolimus injection to aqueous solutions will result in precipitation of drug .
Always combine Temsirolimus injection with DILUENT for Temsirolimus injection before adding to infusion solutions .
It is recommended that Temsirolimus injection be administered in 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection after combining with diluent .
The stability of Temsirolimus injection in other infusion solutions has not been evaluated .
Addition of other drugs or nutritional agents to admixtures of Temsirolimus injection in 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection has not been evaluated and should be avoided .
Temsirolimus is degraded by both acids and bases , and thus combinations of temsirolimus with agents capable of modifying solution pH should be avoided .

( 5 . 11 ) • Live vaccinations and close contact with those who received live vaccines should be avoided .
( 5 . 14 ) • Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm .
Advise patients of the potential hazard to the fetus and to use effective contraception .
( 5 . 15 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) • Elderly patients may be more likely to experience certain adverse reactions , including diarrhea , edema and pneumonia .
( 5 . 16 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity / Infusion Reactions Hypersensitivity / infusion reactions , including but not limited to flushing , chest pain , dyspnea , hypotension , apnea , loss of consciousness , hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis , have been associated with the administration of temsirolimus .
These reactions can occur very early in the first infusion , but may also occur with subsequent infusions .
Patients should be monitored throughout the infusion and appropriate supportive care should be available .
Temsirolimus infusion should be interrupted in all patients with severe infusion reactions and appropriate medical therapy administered .
Temsirolimus injection should be used with caution in persons with known hypersensitivity to temsirolimus or its metabolites ( including sirolimus ) , polysorbate 80 , or to any other component ( including the excipients ) of Temsirolimus injection .
An H1 antihistamine should be administered to patients before the start of the intravenous temsirolimus infusion .
Temsirolimus injection should be used with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to an antihistamine , or patients who cannot receive an antihistamine for other medical reasons .
If a patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction during the Temsirolimus injection infusion , the infusion should be stopped and the patient should be observed for at least 30 to 60 minutes ( depending on the severity of the reaction ) .
At the discretion of the physician , treatment may be resumed with the administration of an H1 - receptor antagonist ( such as diphenhydramine ) , if not previously administered [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] , and / or an H2 - receptor antagonist ( such as intravenous famotidine 20 mg or intravenous ranitidine 50 mg ) approximately 30 minutes before restarting the Temsirolimus injection infusion .
The infusion may then be resumed at a slower rate ( up to 60 minutes ) .
A benefit - risk assessment should be done prior to the continuation of temsirolimus therapy in patients with severe or life - threatening reactions .
5 . 2 Hepatic Impairment The safety and pharmacokinetics of Temsirolimus injection were evaluated in a dose escalation phase 1 study in 110 patients with normal or varying degrees of hepatic impairment .
Patients with baseline bilirubin > 1 . 5 × ULN experienced greater toxicity than patients with baseline bilirubin ≤ 1 . 5 × ULN when treated with Temsirolimus injection .
The overall frequency of ≥ grade 3 adverse reactions and deaths , including deaths due to progressive disease , were greater in patients with baseline bilirubin > 1 . 5 × ULN due to increased risk of death [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Use caution when treating patients with mild hepatic impairment .
Concentrations of temsirolimus and its metabolite sirolimus were increased in patients with elevated AST or bilirubin levels .
If Temsirolimus injection must be given in patients with mild hepatic impairment ( bilirubin > 1 – 1 . 5 × ULN or AST > ULN but bilirubin ≤ ULN ) , reduce the dose of Temsirolimus injection to 15 mg / week [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 3 Hyperglycemia / Glucose Intolerance The use of Temsirolimus injection is likely to result in increases in serum glucose .
In the phase 3 trial , 89 % of patients receiving Temsirolimus injection had at least one elevated serum glucose while on treatment , and 26 % of patients reported hyperglycemia as an adverse event .
This may result in the need for an increase in the dose of , or initiation of , insulin and / or oral hypoglycemic agent therapy .
Serum glucose should be tested before and during treatment with Temsirolimus injection .
Patients should be advised to report excessive thirst or any increase in the volume or frequency of urination .
5 . 4 Infections The use of Temsirolimus injection may result in immunosuppression .
Patients should be carefully observed for the occurrence of infections , including opportunistic infections [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia ( PJP ) , including fatalities , has been reported in patients who received temsirolimus .
This may be associated with concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents .
Prophylaxis of PJP should be considered when concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required .
5 . 5 Interstitial Lung Disease Cases of interstitial lung disease , some resulting in death , occurred in patients who received Temsirolimus injection .
Some patients were asymptomatic , or had minimal symptoms , with infiltrates detected on computed tomography scan or chest radiograph .
Others presented with symptoms such as dyspnea , cough , hypoxia , and fever .
Some patients required discontinuation of Temsirolimus injection and / or treatment with corticosteroids and / or antibiotics , while some patients continued treatment without additional intervention .
Patients should be advised to report promptly any new or worsening respiratory symptoms .
It is recommended that patients undergo baseline radiographic assessment by lung computed tomography scan or chest radiograph prior to the initiation of Temsirolimus injection therapy .
Follow such assessments periodically , even in the absence of clinical respiratory symptoms .
It is recommended that patients be followed closely for occurrence of clinical respiratory symptoms .
If clinically significant respiratory symptoms develop , consider withholding Temsirolimus injection administration until after recovery of symptoms and improvement of radiographic findings related to pneumonitis .
Empiric treatment with corticosteroids and / or antibiotics may be considered .
Opportunistic infections such as PJP should be considered in the differential diagnosis .
For patients who require use of corticosteroids , prophylaxis of PJP may be considered .
5 . 6 Hyperlipidemia The use of Temsirolimus injection is likely to result in increases in serum triglycerides and cholesterol .
In the phase 3 trial , 87 % of patients receiving Temsirolimus injection had at least one elevated serum cholesterol value and 83 % had at least one elevated serum triglyceride value .
This may require initiation , or increase in the dose , of lipid - lowering agents .
Serum cholesterol and triglycerides should be tested before and during treatment with Temsirolimus injection .
5 . 7 Bowel Perforation Cases of fatal bowel perforation occurred in patients who received Temsirolimus injection .
These patients presented with fever , abdominal pain , metabolic acidosis , bloody stools , diarrhea , and / or acute abdomen .
Patients should be advised to report promptly any new or worsening abdominal pain or blood in their stools .
5 . 8 Renal Failure Cases of rapidly progressive and sometimes fatal acute renal failure not clearly related to disease progression occurred in patients who received Temsirolimus injection .
Some of these cases were not responsive to dialysis .
5 . 9 Wound Healing Complications Use of Temsirolimus injection has been associated with abnormal wound healing .
Therefore , caution should be exercised with the use of Temsirolimus injection in the perioperative period .
5 . 10 Intracerebral Hemorrhage Patients with central nervous system tumors ( primary CNS tumor or metastases ) and / or receiving anticoagulation therapy may be at an increased risk of developing intracerebral bleeding ( including fatal outcomes ) while receiving Temsirolimus injection .
5 . 11 Proteinuria and Nephrotic syndrome Proteinuria ( including cases of nephrotic syndrome ) has occurred in patients treated with Temsirolimus injection .
Monitor urine protein prior to the start of Temsirolimus injection therapy and periodically thereafter .
Discontinue Temsirolimus injection in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome .
5 . 12 Co - administration with Inducers or Inhibitors of CYP3A Metabolism Agents Inducing CYP3A Metabolism : Strong inducers of CYP3A4 / 5 such as dexamethasone , carbamazepine , phenytoin , phenobarbital , rifampin , rifabutin , and rifampacin may decrease exposure of the active metabolite , sirolimus .
If alternative treatment cannot be administered , a dose adjustment should be considered .
St . John ’ s Wort may decrease Temsirolimus injection plasma concentrations unpredictably .
Patients receiving Temsirolimus injection should not take St . John ’ s Wort concomitantly [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Agents Inhibiting CYP3A Metabolism : Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as atazanavir , clarithromycin , indinavir , itraconazole , ketoconazole , nefazodone , nelfinavir , ritonavir , saquinavir , and telithromycin may increase blood concentrations of the active metabolite sirolimus .
If alternative treatments cannot be administered , a dose adjustment should be considered [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 13 Concomitant use of Temsirolimus injection with sunitinib The combination of Temsirolimus injection and sunitinib resulted in dose - limiting toxicity .
Dose - limiting toxicities ( Grade 3 / 4 erythematous maculopapular rash , and gout / cellulitis requiring hospitalization ) were observed in two out of three patients treated in the first cohort of a phase 1 study at doses of Temsirolimus injection 15 mg IV per week and sunitinib 25 mg oral per day ( Days 1 - 28 followed by a 2 - week rest ) .
5 . 14 Vaccinations The use of live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with Temsirolimus injection .
Examples of live vaccines are : intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , BCG , yellow fever , varicella , and TY21a typhoid vaccines .
5 . 15 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animal studies and its mechanism of action , Temsirolimus injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
In animal reproduction studies , daily oral administration of temsirolimus to pregnant animals during organogenesis caused adverse embryo - fetal effects in rats and rabbits at approximately 0 . 04 and 0 . 12 times the AUC in patients at the recommended human dose , respectively .
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Temsirolimus injection and for 3 months after the last dose .
Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Temsirolimus injection and for 3 months after the last dose [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 16 Elderly Patients Based on the results of a phase 3 study , elderly patients may be more likely to experience certain adverse reactions including diarrhea , edema and pneumonia [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to readily estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving temsirolimus : angioedema , rhabdomyolysis , Stevens - Johnson Syndrome , and complex regional pain syndrome ( reflex sympathetic dystrophy ) .
There are also post - marketing reports of temsirolimus extravasations resulting in swelling , pain , warmth , and erythema 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong inducers of CYP3A4 / 5 and inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect concentrations of the primary metabolite of Temsirolimus injection .
If alternatives cannot be used , dose modifications of Temsirolimus injection are recommended .
( 7 . 1 , 7 . 2 , 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Agents Inducing CYP3A Metabolism Co - administration of Temsirolimus injection with rifampin , a potent CYP3A4 / 5 inducer , had no significant effect on temsirolimus Cmax ( maximum concentration ) and AUC ( area under the concentration versus the time curve ) after intravenous administration , but decreased sirolimus Cmax by 65 % and AUC by 56 % compared to Temsirolimus injection treatment alone .
If alternative treatment cannot be administered , a dose adjustment should be considered [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
7 . 2 Agents Inhibiting CYP3A Metabolism Co - administration of Temsirolimus injection with ketoconazole , a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor , had no significant effect on temsirolimus Cmax or AUC ; however , sirolimus AUC increased 3 . 1 - fold , and Cmax increased 2 . 2 - fold compared to Temsirolimus injection alone .
If alternative treatment cannot be administered , a dose adjustment should be considered [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
7 . 3 Angioedema with ACE inhibitors and Calcium Channel Blokers Angioedema has been reported in patients taking mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitors in combination with ramipril and / or amlodipine .
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of angioedema when temsirolimus is given concomitantly with an angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors ( e . g . , ramipril ) or calcium channel blockers ( CCB ) ( e . g . , amlodipine ) .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Do not breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and its mechanism of action , temsirolimus can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
Although there are no data on the use of Temsirolimus injection in pregnant women , there are limited data on the use of sirolimus , the active metabolite of temsirolimus , during pregnancy ; however , these data are insufficient to inform a drug - associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes .
In animal reproductive studies , oral daily administration of temsirolimus to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis caused adverse embryo - fetal effects at approximately 0 . 04 and 0 . 12 times the AUC in patients at the recommended dose , respectively ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential hazard to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 – 4 % and 15 – 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Temsirolimus administered daily as an oral formulation throughout organogenesis caused adverse embryo - fetal effects in rats and rabbits at human sub - therapeutic exposures .
Embryo - fetal adverse effects in rats consisted of reduced fetal weight and reduced ossifications , and in rabbits included reduced fetal weight , omphalocele , bifurcated sternabrae , notched ribs , and incomplete ossifications In rats , the adverse embryo - fetal effects were observed at the oral dose of 2 . 7 mg / m2 / day ( approximately 0 . 04 - fold the AUC in patients with cancer at the human recommended dose ) .
In rabbits , the adverse embryo - fetal effects were observed at the oral dose of ≥ 7 . 2 mg / m2 / day ( approximately 0 . 12 - fold the AUC in patients with cancer at the recommended human dose ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of Temsirolimus injection or its metabolites in human milk , or their effects on the breastfed child or milk production .
Trace amounts of sirolimus , the active metabolite of temsirolimus , were present in milk from lactating rats administered sirolimus .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from Temsirolimus injection , advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with Temsirolimus injection and for 3 weeks after the final dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females Temsirolimus injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Population ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Temsirolimus injection and for 3 months after the last dose .
Males Advise males with partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Temsirolimus injection and for 3 months after the last dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Based on the findings in animal fertility studies , male and female fertility may be compromised by the treatment with Temsirolimus injection .
It is not known if the effects on fertility in animal studies were reversible [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Limited data are available on the use of temsirolimus in pediatric patients .
The effectiveness of temsirolimus in pediatric patients with advanced recurrent / refractory solid tumors has not been established .
Temsirolimus injection was studied in 71 patients ( 59 patients ages 1 to 17 years and 12 patients ages 18 to 21 years ) with relapsed / refractory solid tumors in a phase 1 - 2 safety and exploratory pharmacodynamic study .
In phase 1 , 19 pediatric patients with advanced recurrent / refractory solid tumors received Temsirolimus injection at doses ranging from 10 mg / m2 to 150 mg / m2 as a 60 - minute intravenous infusion once weekly in three - week cycles .
In phase 2 , 52 pediatric patients with recurrent / relapsed neuroblastoma , rhabdomyosarcoma or high grade glioma received Temsirolimus injection at a weekly dose of 75 mg / m2 .
One of 19 patients with neuroblastoma achieved a partial response .
There were no objective responses in pediatric patients with recurrent / relapsed rhabdomyosarcoma or high grade glioma .
Adverse reactions associated with Temsirolimus injection were similar to those observed in adults .
The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 20 % ) in pediatric patients receiving the 75 mg / m2 dose included thrombocytopenia , infections , asthenia / fatigue , fever , pain , leukopenia , rash , anemia , hyperlipidemia , increased cough , stomatitis , anorexia , increased plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase , hypercholesterolemia , hyperglycemia , abdominal pain , headache , arthralgia , upper respiratory infection , nausea and vomiting , neutropenia , hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia .
Pharmacokinetics : In phase 1 of the above mentioned pediatric trial , the single dose and multiple dose total systemic exposure ( AUC ) of temsirolimus and sirolimus were less than dose - proportional over the dose range of 10 to 150 mg / m2 .
In the phase 2 portion , the multiple dose ( Day 1 , Cycle 2 ) pharmacokinetics of Temsirolimus injection 75 mg / m2 were characterized in an additional 35 patients ages 28 days to 21 years ( median age of 8 years ) .
The geometric mean body surface adjusted clearance of temsirolimus and sirolimus was 9 . 45 L / h / m2 and 9 . 26 L / h / m2 , respectively .
The mean elimination half - life of temsirolimus and sirolimus was 31 hours and 44 hours , respectively .
The exposure ( AUCss ) to temsirolimus and sirolimus was approximately 6 - fold and 2 - fold higher , respectively than the exposure in adult patients receiving a 25 mg intravenous infusion .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Temsirolimus injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Based on the results of a phase 3 study , elderly patients may be more likely to experience certain adverse reactions including diarrhea , edema and pneumonia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 16 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No clinical studies were conducted with Temsirolimus injection in patients with decreased renal function .
Less than 5 % of total radioactivity was excreted in the urine following a 25 mg intravenous dose of [ 14 C ] - labeled temsirolimus in healthy subjects .
Renal impairment is not expected to markedly influence drug exposure , and no dosage adjustment of Temsirolimus injection is recommended in patients with renal impairment .
Temsirolimus injection has not been studied in patients undergoing hemodialysis .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Temsirolimus injection was evaluated in a dose escalation phase 1 study in 110 patients with normal or varying degrees of hepatic impairment as defined by AST and bilirubin levels and patients with liver transplant ( Table 3 ) .
Patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment had increased rates of adverse reactions and deaths , including deaths due to progressive disease , during the study ( Table 3 ) .
Table 3 – Adverse Reactions in Patients with Advanced Malignancies Plus Normal or Impaired Hepatic Function Hepatic Function * Temsirolimus injection Dose Range Adverse Reactions Grade ≥ 3 ** n ( % ) Death *** n ( % ) Normal ( n = 25 ) 25 – 175 20 ( 80 . 0 ) 2 ( 8 . 0 ) Mild ( n = 39 ) 10 – 25 32 ( 82 . 1 ) 5 ( 12 . 8 ) Moderate ( n = 20 ) 10 – 25 19 ( 95 . 0 ) 8 ( 40 . 0 ) Severe ( n = 24 ) 7 . 5 – 15 23 ( 95 . 8 ) 13 ( 54 . 2 ) Liver Transplant ( n = 2 ) 10 1 ( 50 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 ) * Hepatic Function Groups : normal = bilirubin and AST ≤ ULN ; mild = bilirubin > 1 – 1 . 5 × ULN or AST > ULN but bilirubin ≤ ULN ; moderate = bilirubin > 1 . 5 – 3 × ULN ; severe = bilirubin > 3 × ULN ; liver transplant = any bilirubin and AST .
** Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events , version 3 . 0 , including all causality .
*** Includes deaths due to progressive disease and adverse reactions .
Temsirolimus injection is contraindicated in patients with bilirubin > 1 . 5 × ULN [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Use caution when treating patients with mild hepatic impairment .
If Temsirolimus injection must be given in patients with mild hepatic impairment ( bilirubin > 1 - 1 . 5 × ULN or AST > ULN but bilirubin ≤ ULN ) , reduce the dose of Temsirolimus injection to 15 mg / week [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Because there is a need for dosage adjustment based upon hepatic function , assessment of AST and bilirubin levels is recommended before initiation of Temsirolimus injection and periodically thereafter .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no specific treatment for Temsirolimus injection intravenous overdose .
Temsirolimus injection has been administered to patients with cancer in phase 1 and 2 trials with repeated intravenous doses as high as 220 mg / m2 .
The risk of several serious adverse events , including thrombosis , bowel perforation , interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) , seizure , and psychosis , is increased with doses of Temsirolimus injection greater than 25 mg .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] Temsirolimus injection , 25 mg / mL , is a clear , colorless to light yellow , non - aqueous , ethanolic , sterile solution .
Temsirolimus injection requires two dilutions prior to intravenous infusion .
Temsirolimus injection should be diluted only with the supplied DILUENT for Temsirolimus injection .
DILUENT for Temsirolimus injection is a sterile , non - aqueous solution that is supplied with Temsirolimus injection , as a kit .
Temsirolimus injection , 25 mg / mL : Active ingredient : temsirolimus ( 25 mg / mL ) Inactive ingredients : dehydrated alcohol ( 49 . 90 % v / v ) , butylated hydroxy anisole ( 0 . 0003 % w / v ) , butylated hydroxy toluene ( 0 . 002 % w / v ) , propylene glycol ( 50 . 3 % w / v ) , and anhydrous citric acid ( 0 . 0025 % w / v ) .

Temsirolimus injection and DILUENT for Temsirolimus injection are filled in clear glass vials with butyl rubber stoppers .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Temsirolimus is an inhibitor of mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) .
Temsirolimus binds to an intracellular protein ( FKBP - 12 ) , and the protein - drug complex inhibits the activity of mTOR that controls cell division .
Inhibition of mTOR activity resulted in a G1 growth arrest in treated tumor cells .
When mTOR was inhibited , its ability to phosphorylate p70S6k and S6 ribosomal protein , which are downstream of mTOR in the PI3 kinase / AKT pathway was blocked .
In in vitro studies using renal cell carcinoma cell lines , temsirolimus inhibited the activity of mTOR and resulted in reduced levels of the hypoxia - inducible factors HIF - 1 and HIF - 2 alpha , and the vascular endothelial growth factor .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on Electrocardiogram : There were no clinically relevant QT changes observed at the recommended dose for Temsirolimus injection .
In a randomized , single - blinded , crossover study , 58 healthy subjects received Temsirolimus injection 25 mg , placebo , and a single oral dose of moxifloxacin 400 mg .
A supratherapeutic Temsirolimus injection dose was not studied in this randomized QT trial .
The largest difference between the upper bound 2 - sided 90 % CI for the mean difference between Temsirolimus injection and placebo - corrected QT interval was less than 10 ms . In a different trial in 69 patients with a hematologic malignancy , Temsirolimus injection doses up to 175 mg were studied .
No patient with a normal QTcF at baseline had an increase in QTcF > 60 ms . Additionally , there were no patients with a QTcF interval greater than 500 ms . 12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following administration of a single 25 mg dose of Temsirolimus injection in patients with cancer , mean temsirolimus Cmax in whole blood was 585 ng / mL ( coefficient of variation , CV = 14 % ) , and mean AUC in blood was 1627 ng • h / mL ( CV = 26 % ) .
Typically Cmax occurred at the end of infusion .
Over the dose range of 1 mg to 25 mg , temsirolimus exposure increased in a less than dose proportional manner while sirolimus exposure increased proportionally with dose .
Following a single 25 mg intravenous dose in patients with cancer , sirolimus AUC was 2 . 7 - fold that of temsirolimus AUC , due principally to the longer half - life of sirolimus .
Distribution Following a single 25 mg intravenous dose , mean steady - state volume of distribution of temsirolimus in whole blood of patients with cancer was 172 liters .
Both temsirolimus and sirolimus are extensively partitioned into formed blood elements .
Metabolism Cytochrome P450 3A4 is the major isozyme responsible for the formation of five temsirolimus metabolites .
Sirolimus , an active metabolite of temsirolimus , is the principal metabolite in humans following intravenous treatment .
The remainder of the metabolites account for less than 10 % of radioactivity in the plasma .
In human liver microsomes temsirolimus was an inhibitor of CYP2D6 and 3A4 .
However , there was no effect observed in vivo when temsirolimus was administered with desipramine ( a CYP2D6 substrate ) , and no effect is anticipated with substrates of CYP3A4 metabolism .
Elimination Elimination is primarily via the feces .
After a single IV dose of [ 14 C ] - temsirolimus approximately 82 % of total radioactivity was eliminated within 14 days , with 4 . 6 % and 78 % of the administered radioactivity recovered in the urine and feces , respectively .
Following a single 25 mg dose of Temsirolimus injection in patients with cancer , temsirolimus mean ( CV ) systemic clearance was 16 . 2 ( 22 % ) L / h .
Temsirolimus exhibits a bi - exponential decline in whole blood concentrations and the mean half - lives of temsirolimus and sirolimus were 17 . 3 hr and 54 . 6 hr , respectively .
Drug - Transport Systems - P - glycoprotein Temsirolimus is a substrate of the efflux transporter P - glycoprotein ( Pgp ) in vitro .
If Temsirolimus injection is administered with drugs that inhibit Pgp , increased concentrations of temsirolimus are likely and caution should be exercised .
In vitro , temsirolimus inhibited human Pgp ( IC50 value of 2μM ) .
If Temsirolimus injection is administered with drugs that are substrates of Pgp , increased concentrations of the substrate drug are likely and caution should be exercised .
Effects of Age and Gender In population pharmacokinetic - based data analyses , no relationship was apparent between drug exposure and patient age or gender .
Drug Interactions Effect of Temsirolimus on CYP2D6 or CYP3A The concentration of desipramine , a CYP2D6 substrate , was unaffected when 25 mg of temsirolimus was co - administered .
No clinically significant effect is anticipated when 25 mg of temsirolimus is co - administered with agents that are metabolized by CYP2D6 or CYP3A .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with temsirolimus .
However , sirolimus , the major metabolite of temsirolimus in humans , was carcinogenic in mice and rats .
The following effects were reported in mice and / or rats in the carcinogenicity studies conducted with sirolimus : lymphoma , hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma , and testicular adenoma .
Temsirolimus was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro ( bacterial reverse mutation in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , forward mutation in mouse lymphoma cells , and chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells ) and in vivo ( mouse micronucleus ) assays .
In a fertility study in male rats , decreased number of pregnancies , decreased sperm concentration and motility , decreased reproductive organ weights , and testicular tubular degeneration were observed .
These effects were observed at oral temsirolimus doses ≥ 3 mg / m2 / day ( approximately 0 . 2 - fold the human recommended intravenous dose ) .
Fertility was absent at 30 mg / m2 / day .
In a fertility study in female rats , an increased incidence of pre - and post - implantation losses occurred at oral doses ≥ 4 . 2 mg / m2 / day ( approximately 0 . 3 - fold the human recommended intravenous dose ) , resulting in decreased numbers of live fetuses .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES A phase 3 , multi - center , three - arm , randomized , open - label study was conducted in previously untreated patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma ( clear cell and non - clear cell histologies ) .
The objectives were to compare Overall Survival ( OS ) , Progression - Free Survival ( PFS ) , Objective Response Rate ( ORR ) , and safety in patients receiving IFN - α to those receiving Temsirolimus injection or Temsirolimus injection plus IFN - α .
Patients in this study had 3 or more of 6 pre - selected prognostic risk factors ( less than one year from time of initial RCC diagnosis to randomization , Karnofsky performance status of 60 or 70 , hemoglobin less than the lower limit of normal , corrected calcium of greater than 10 mg / dL , lactate dehydrogenase > 1 . 5 times the upper limit of normal , more than one metastatic organ site ) .
Patients were stratified for prior nephrectomy status within three geographic regions and were randomly assigned ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) to receive IFN - α alone ( n = 207 ) , Temsirolimus injection alone ( 25 mg weekly ; n = 209 ) , or the combination arm ( n = 210 ) .
The ITT population for this interim analysis included 626 patients .
Demographics were comparable between the three treatment arms with regard to age , gender , and race .
The mean age of all groups was 59 years ( range 23 – 86 ) .
Sixty - nine percent were male and 31 % were female .
The racial distribution for all groups was 91 % White , 4 % Black , 2 % Asian , and 3 % other .
Sixty - seven percent of patients had a history of prior nephrectomy .
The median duration of treatment in the Temsirolimus injection arm was 17 weeks ( range 1 – 126 weeks ) .
The median duration of treatment on the IFN arm was 8 weeks ( range 1 – 124 weeks ) .
There was a statistically significant improvement in OS ( time from randomization to death ) in the Temsirolimus injection 25 mg arm compared to IFN - α .
The combination of Temsirolimus injection 15 mg and IFN - α did not result in a significant increase in overall survival when compared with IFN - α alone .
Figure 1 is a Kaplan - Meier plot of OS in this study .
The evaluations of PFS ( time from randomization to disease progression or death ) and ORR , were based on blinded independent radiologic assessment of tumor response .
Efficacy results are summarized in Table 4 .
