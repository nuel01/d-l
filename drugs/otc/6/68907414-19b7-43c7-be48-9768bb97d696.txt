• Patients who are not currently vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis , unless the risks of delaying Soliris treatment outweigh the risks of developing a meningococcal infection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Soliris is contraindicated in : • Patients with unresolved serious Neisseria meningitidis infection ( 4 ) .
• Patients who are not currently vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis , unless the risks of delaying Soliris treatment outweigh the risks of developing a meningococcal infection ( 5 . 1 ) .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Discontinue Soliris in patients who are being treated for serious meningococcal infections ( 5 . 1 ) .
• Use caution when administering Soliris to patients with any other systemic infection ( 5 . 2 ) .
• Infusion - Related Reactions : Monitor patients during infusion , interrupt for reactions , and institute appropriate supportive measures ( 5 . 5 ) 5 . 1 Serious Meningococcal Infections Risk and Prevention Life - threatening and fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in patients treated with Soliris .
The use of Soliris increases a patient ' s susceptibility to serious meningococcal infections ( septicemia and / or meningitis ) .
Soliris is associated with an approximate 2 , 000 - fold increased risk of meningococcal disease in comparison to the general U . S . population annual rate ( 0 . 14 per 100 , 000 population in 2015 ) .
Vaccinate for meningococcal disease according to the most current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) recommendations for patients with complement deficiencies .
Revaccinate patients in accordance with ACIP recommendations , considering the duration of Soliris therapy .
Immunize patients without a history of meningococcal vaccination at least 2 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of Soliris .
If urgent Soliris therapy is indicated in an unvaccinated patient , administer meningococcal vaccine ( s ) as soon as possible and provide patients with two weeks of antibacterial drug prophylaxis .
In prospective clinical studies , 75 / 100 patients with aHUS were treated with Soliris less than 2 weeks after meningococcal vaccination and 64 of these 75 patients received antibiotics for prophylaxis of meningococcal infection until at least 2 weeks after meningococcal vaccination .
The benefits and risks of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of meningococcal infections in patients receiving Soliris have not been established .
Vaccination reduces , but does not eliminate , the risk of meningococcal infections .
In clinical studies , 2 out of 196 PNH patients developed serious meningococcal infections while receiving treatment with Soliris ; both had been vaccinated [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In clinical studies among non - PNH patients , meningococcal meningitis occurred in one unvaccinated patient .
In addition , 3 out of 130 previously vaccinated patients with aHUS developed meningococcal infections while receiving treatment with Soliris [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Closely monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection and evaluate patients immediately if an infection is suspected .
Meningococcal infection may become rapidly life - threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early .
Discontinue Soliris in patients who are undergoing treatment for serious meningococcal infections .
REMS Because of the risk of meningococcal infections , Soliris is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS ) .
Under the Soliris REMS , prescribers must enroll in the program .
Prescribers must counsel patients about the risk of meningococcal infection , provide the patients with the REMS educational materials , and ensure patients are vaccinated with meningococcal vaccine ( s ) .
Enrollment in the Soliris REMS program and additional information are available by telephone : 1 - 888 - SOLIRIS ( 1 - 888 - 765 - 4747 ) or at www . solirisrems . com .
5 . 2 Other Infections Serious infections with Neisseria species ( other than N . meningitidis ) , including disseminated gonococcal infections , have been reported .
Soliris blocks terminal complement activation ; therefore patients may have increased susceptibility to infections , especially with encapsulated bacteria .
Additionally , Aspergillus infections have occurred in immunocompromised and neutropenic patients .
Children treated with Soliris may be at increased risk of developing serious infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) .
Administer vaccinations for the prevention of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) infections according to ACIP guidelines .
Use caution when administering Soliris to patients with any systemic infection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 3 Monitoring Disease Manifestations after Soliris Discontinuation Treatment Discontinuation for PNH Monitor patients after discontinuing Soliris for at least 8 weeks to detect hemolysis .
Treatment Discontinuation for aHUS After discontinuing Soliris , monitor patients with aHUS for signs and symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) complications for at least 12 weeks .
In aHUS clinical trials , 18 patients ( 5 in the prospective studies ) discontinued Soliris treatment .
TMA complications occurred following a missed dose in 5 patients , and Soliris was reinitiated in 4 of these 5 patients .
Clinical signs and symptoms of TMA include changes in mental status , seizures , angina , dyspnea , or thrombosis .
In addition , the following changes in laboratory parameters may identify a TMA complication : occurrence of two , or repeated measurement of any one of the following : a decrease in platelet count by 25 % or more compared to baseline or the peak platelet count during Soliris treatment ; an increase in serum creatinine by 25 % or more compared to baseline or nadir during Soliris treatment ; or , an increase in serum LDH by 25 % or more over baseline or nadir during Soliris treatment .
If TMA complications occur after Soliris discontinuation , consider reinstitution of Soliris treatment , plasma therapy [ plasmapheresis , plasma exchange , or fresh frozen plasma infusion ( PE / PI ) ] , or appropriate organ - specific supportive measures .
5 . 4 Thrombosis Prevention and Management The effect of withdrawal of anticoagulant therapy during Soliris treatment has not been established .
Therefore , treatment with Soliris should not alter anticoagulant management .
5 . 5 Infusion - Related Reactions Administration of Soliris may result in infusion - related reactions , including anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reactions .
In clinical trials , no patients experienced an infusion - related reaction which required discontinuation of Soliris .
Interrupt Soliris infusion and institute appropriate supportive measures if signs of cardiovascular instability or respiratory compromise occur .

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies to eculizumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading .
The immunogenicity of Soliris has been evaluated using two different immunoassays for the detection of anti - eculizumab antibodies : a direct enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) using the Fab fragment of eculizumab as target was used for the PNH indication ; and an electro - chemiluminescence ( ECL ) bridging assay using the eculizumab whole molecule as target was used for the aHUS , gMG , and NMOSD indications , as well as for additional patients with PNH .
In the PNH population , antibodies to Soliris were detected in 3 / 196 ( 2 % ) patients using the ELISA assay and in 5 / 161 ( 3 % ) patients using the ECL assay .
In the aHUS population , antibodies to Soliris were detected in 3 / 100 ( 3 % ) patients using the ECL assay .
None of the 62 patients with gMG had antibodies to Soliris detected following the 26 - week active treatment .
Two of the 96 ( 2 % ) Soliris - treated patients with NMOSD had antibodies to Soliris detected during the entire treatment period .
An ECL based neutralizing assay with a low sensitivity of 2 mcg / mL was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies for the 5 patients with PNH , the 3 patients with aHUS , and the 2 patients with NMOSD with anti - eculizumab antibody positive samples using the ECL assay .
Two of 161 patients with PNH ( 1 . 2 % ) and 1 of 100 patients with aHUS ( 1 % ) , and none of the 96 patients with NMOSD had low positive values for neutralizing antibodies .
No apparent correlation of antibody development to clinical response was observed .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of Soliris .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to Soliris exposure .
Fatal or serious infections : Neisseria gonorrhoeae , Neisseria meningitidis , Neisseria sicca / subflava , Neisseria spp unspecified 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data on outcomes of pregnancies that have occurred following Soliris use in pregnant women have not identified a concern for specific adverse developmental outcomes ( see Data ) .
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome ( aHUS ) in pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
Animal studies using a mouse analogue of the Soliris molecule ( murine anti - C5 antibody ) showed increased rates of developmental abnormalities and an increased rate of dead and moribund offspring at doses 2 - 8 times the human dose ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defect and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or fetal / neonatal risk PNH in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes , including worsening cytopenias , thrombotic events , infections , bleeding , miscarriages and increased maternal mortality , and adverse fetal outcomes , including fetal death and premature delivery .
aHUS in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes , including pre - eclampsia and preterm delivery , and adverse fetal / neonatal outcomes , including intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) , fetal death and low birth weight .
Data Human Data A pooled analysis of prospectively ( 50 . 3 % ) and retrospectively ( 49 . 7 % ) collected data in more than 300 pregnant women with live births following exposure to Soliris have not suggested safety concerns .
However , these data cannot definitively exclude any drug - associated risk during pregnancy , because of the limited sample size .
Animal Data Animal reproduction studies were conducted in mice using doses of a murine anti - C5 antibody that approximated 2 - 4 times ( low dose ) and 4 - 8 times ( high dose ) the recommended human Soliris dose , based on a body weight comparison .
When animal exposure to the antibody occurred in the time period from before mating until early gestation , no decrease in fertility or reproductive performance was observed .
When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred during organogenesis , two cases of retinal dysplasia and one case of umbilical hernia were observed among 230 offspring born to mothers exposed to the higher antibody dose ; however , the exposure did not increase fetal loss or neonatal death .
When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred in the time period from implantation through weaning , a higher number of male offspring became moribund or died ( 1 / 25 controls , 2 / 25 low dose group , 5 / 25 high dose group ) .
Surviving offspring had normal development and reproductive function .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Although limited published data does not report detectable levels of eculizumab in human milk , maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk .
Available information is insufficient to inform the effect of eculizumab on the breastfed infant .
There are no data on the effects of eculizumab on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for Soliris and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from eculizumab or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Soliris for the treatment of PNH , gMG , or NMOSD in pediatric patients have not been established .
The safety and effectiveness of Soliris for the treatment of aHUS have been established in pediatric patients .
Use of Soliris in pediatric patients for this indication is supported by evidence from four adequate and well - controlled clinical studies assessing the safety and effectiveness of Soliris for the treatment of aHUS .
The studies included a total of 47 pediatric patients ( ages 2 months to 17 years ) .
The safety and effectiveness of Soliris for the treatment of aHUS appear similar in pediatric and adult patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Administer vaccinations for the prevention of infection due to Neisseria meningitidis , Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) according to ACIP guidelines [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Fifty - one patients 65 years of age or older ( 15 with PNH , 4 with aHUS , 26 with gMG , and 6 with NMOSD ) were treated with Soliris in clinical trials in the approved indications .
Although there were no apparent age - related differences observed in these studies , the number of patients aged 65 and over is not sufficient to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
11 DESCRIPTION Eculizumab , a complement inhibitor , is a recombinant humanized monoclonal IgG2 / 4κ antibody produced by murine myeloma cell culture and purified by standard bioprocess technology .
Eculizumab contains human constant regions from human IgG2 sequences and human IgG4 sequences and murine complementarity - determining regions grafted onto the human framework light - and heavy - chain variable regions .
Eculizumab is composed of two 448 amino acid heavy chains and two 214 amino acid light chains and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kDa .
Soliris ( eculizumab ) injection is a sterile , clear , colorless , preservative - free 10 mg / mL solution for intravenous infusion and is supplied in 30 - mL single - dose vials .
The product is formulated at pH 7 and each 30 mL vial contains 300 mg of eculizumab , polysorbate 80 ( 6 . 6 mg ) ( vegetable origin ) , sodium chloride ( 263 . 1 mg ) , sodium phosphate dibasic ( 53 . 4 mg ) , sodium phosphate monobasic ( 13 . 8 mg ) , and Water for Injection , USP .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Eculizumab , the active ingredient in Soliris , is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high affinity , thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and preventing the generation of the terminal complement complex C5b - 9 .
Soliris inhibits terminal complement - mediated intravascular hemolysis in PNH patients and complement - mediated thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) in patients with aHUS .
The precise mechanism by which eculizumab exerts its therapeutic effect in gMG patients is unknown , but is presumed to involve reduction of terminal complement complex C5b - 9 deposition at the neuromuscular junction .
The precise mechanism by which eculizumab exerts its therapeutic effect in NMOSD is unknown , but is presumed to involve inhibition of aquaporin - 4 - antibody induced terminal complement C5b - 9 deposition .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In the placebo - controlled clinical study ( PNH Study 1 ) , Soliris when administered as recommended reduced serum LDH levels from 2200 ± 1034 U / L ( mean ± SD ) at baseline to 700 ± 388 U / L by week one and maintained the effect through the end of the study at week 26 ( 327 ± 433 U / L ) in patients with PNH .
In the single arm clinical study ( PNH Study 2 ) , the effect was maintained through week 52 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
In patients with PNH , aHUS , gMG , and NMOSD , free C5 concentrations of < 0 . 5 mcg / mL was correlated with complete blockade of terminal complement activity .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following intravenous maintenance doses of 900 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with PNH , the week 26 observed mean ± SD serum eculizumab maximum concentration ( Cmax ) was 194 ± 76 mcg / mL and the trough concentration ( Ctrough ) was 97 ± 60 mcg / mL .
Following intravenous maintenance doses of 1200 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with aHUS , the week 26 observed mean ± SD Ctrough was 242 ± 101 mcg / mL .
Following intravenous maintenance doses of 1200 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with gMG , the week 26 observed mean ± SD Cmax was 783 ± 288 mcg / mL and the Ctrough was 341 ± 172 mcg / mL .
Following intravenous maintenance doses of 1200 mg once every 2 weeks in patients with NMOSD , at week 24 , the observed mean ± SD Cmax was 877 ± 331 and the Ctrough was 429 ± 188 mcg / mL .
Steady state was achieved 4 weeks after starting eculizumab treatment , with accumulation ratio of approximately 2 - fold in all studied indications .
Population pharmacokinetic analyses showed that eculizumab pharmacokinetics were dose - linear and time - independent over the 600 mg to 1200 mg dose range , with inter - individual variability of 21 % to 38 % .
Distribution The eculizumab volume of distribution for a typical 70 kg patient was 5 L to 8 L . Elimination The half - life of eculizumab was approximately 270 h to 414 h . Plasma exchange or infusion increased the clearance of eculizumab by approximately 250 - fold and reduced the half - life to 1 . 26 h . Supplemental dosing is recommended when Soliris is administered to patients receiving plasma exchange or infusion [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Specific Populations Age , Sex , and Race : The pharmacokinetics of eculizumab were not affected by age ( 2 months to 85 years ) , sex , or race .
Renal Impairment : Renal function did not affect the pharmacokinetics of eculizumab in PNH ( creatinine clearance of 8 mL / min to 396 mL / min calculated using Cockcroft - Gault formula ) , aHUS ( estimated glomerular filtration rate [ eGFR ] of 5 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 to105 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [ MDRD ] formula ) , or gMG patients ( eGFR of 44 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 to 168 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 using MDRD formula ) .
Drug Interactions Intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) treatment may interfere with the endosomal neonatal Fc receptor ( FcRn ) recycling mechanism of monoclonal antibodies such as eculizumab and thereby decrease serum eculizumab concentrations .
Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with eculizumab in patients treated with IVIg .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term animal carcinogenicity studies of eculizumab have not been conducted .
Genotoxicity studies have not been conducted with eculizumab .
Effects of eculizumab upon fertility have not been studied in animals .
Intravenous injections of male and female mice with a murine anti - C5 antibody at up to 4 - 8 times the equivalent of the clinical dose of Soliris had no adverse effects on mating or fertility .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) The safety and efficacy of Soliris in PNH patients with hemolysis were assessed in a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled 26 week study ( PNH Study 1 , NCT00122330 ) ; PNH patients were also treated with Soliris in a single arm 52 week study ( PNH Study 2 , NCT00122304 ) and in a long - term extension study ( E05 - 001 , NCT00122317 ) .
Patients received meningococcal vaccination prior to receipt of Soliris .
In all studies , the dose of Soliris was 600 mg study drug every 7 ± 2 days for 4 weeks , followed by 900 mg 7 ± 2 days later , then 900 mg every 14 ± 2 days for the study duration .
Soliris was administered as an intravenous infusion over 25 - 45 minutes .
PNH Study 1 : PNH patients with at least four transfusions in the prior 12 months , flow cytometric confirmation of at least 10 % PNH cells and platelet counts of at least 100 , 000 / microliter were randomized to either Soliris ( n = 43 ) or placebo ( n = 44 ) .
Prior to randomization , all patients underwent an initial observation period to confirm the need for RBC transfusion and to identify the hemoglobin concentration ( the " set - point " ) which would define each patient ' s hemoglobin stabilization and transfusion outcomes .
The hemoglobin set - point was less than or equal to 9 g / dL in patients with symptoms and was less than or equal to 7 g / dL in patients without symptoms .
Endpoints related to hemolysis included the numbers of patients achieving hemoglobin stabilization , the number of RBC units transfused , fatigue , and health - related quality of life .
To achieve a designation of hemoglobin stabilization , a patient had to maintain a hemoglobin concentration above the hemoglobin set - point and avoid any RBC transfusion for the entire 26 week period .
Hemolysis was monitored mainly by the measurement of serum LDH levels , and the proportion of PNH RBCs was monitored by flow cytometry .
Patients receiving anticoagulants and systemic corticosteroids at baseline continued these medications .
Major baseline characteristics were balanced ( see Table 10 ) .

These effects were seen among patients within each of the three pre - study RBC transfusion strata ( 4 - 14 units ; 15 - 25 units ; > 25 units ) .
After 3 weeks of Soliris treatment , patients reported less fatigue and improved health - related quality of life .
Because of the study sample size and duration , the effects of Soliris on thrombotic events could not be determined .

Concomitant medications included anti - thrombotic agents in 63 % of the patients and systemic corticosteroids in 40 % of the patients .
Overall , 96 of the 97 enrolled patients completed the study ( one patient died following a thrombotic event ) .
A reduction in intravascular hemolysis as measured by serum LDH levels was sustained for the treatment period and resulted in a reduced need for RBC transfusion and less fatigue .
187 Soliris - treated PNH patients were enrolled in a long term extension study .
All patients sustained a reduction in intravascular hemolysis over a total Soliris exposure time ranging from 10 to 54 months .
There were fewer thrombotic events with Soliris treatment than during the same period of time prior to treatment .
However , the majority of patients received concomitant anticoagulants ; the effects of anticoagulant withdrawal during Soliris therapy was not studied [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
14 . 2 Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome ( aHUS ) Five single - arm studies [ four prospective : C08 - 002 A / B ( NCT00844545 and NCT00844844 ) , C08 - 003 A / B ( NCT00838513 and NCT00844428 ) , C10 - 003 ( NCT01193348 ) , and C10 - 004 ( NCT01194973 ) ; and one retrospective : C09 - 001 r ( NCT01770951 ) ] evaluated the safety and efficacy of Soliris for the treatment of aHUS .
Patients with aHUS received meningococcal vaccination prior to receipt of Soliris or received prophylactic treatment with antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination .
In all studies , the dose of Soliris in adult and adolescent patients was 900 mg every 7 ± 2 days for 4 weeks , followed by 1200 mg 7 ± 2 days later , then 1200 mg every 14 ± 2 days thereafter .
The dosage regimen for pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg enrolled in Study C09 - 001 r and Study C10 - 003 was based on body weight [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Efficacy evaluations were based on thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) endpoints .
Endpoints related to TMA included the following : • platelet count change from baseline • hematologic normalization ( maintenance of normal platelet counts and LDH levels for at least four weeks ) • complete TMA response ( hematologic normalization plus at least a 25 % reduction in serum creatinine for a minimum of four weeks ) • TMA - event free status ( absence for at least 12 weeks of a decrease in platelet count of > 25 % from baseline , plasma exchange or plasma infusion , and new dialysis requirement ) • Daily TMA intervention rate ( defined as the number of plasma exchange or plasma infusion interventions and the number of new dialyses required per patient per day ) .
aHUS Resistant to PE / PI ( Study C08 - 002 A / B ) Study C08 - 002 A / B enrolled patients who displayed signs of thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) despite receiving at least four PE / PI treatments the week prior to screening .
One patient had no PE / PI the week prior to screening because of PE / PI intolerance .
In order to qualify for enrollment , patients were required to have a platelet count ≤ 150 × 109 / L , evidence of hemolysis such as an elevation in serum LDH , and serum creatinine above the upper limits of normal , without the need for chronic dialysis .
The median patient age was 28 ( range : 17 to 68 years ) .
Patients enrolled in Study C08 - 002 A / B were required to have ADAMTS13 activity level above 5 % ; observed range of values in the trial were 70 % - 121 % .
Seventy - six percent of patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto - antibody .

In Study C08 - 002 A / B , the median duration of Soliris therapy was approximately 100 weeks ( range : 2 weeks to 145 weeks ) .
Renal function , as measured by eGFR , was improved and maintained during Soliris therapy .
The mean eGFR ( ± SD ) increased from 23 ± 15 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 at baseline to 56 ± 40 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 by 26 weeks ; this effect was maintained through 2 years ( 56 ± 30 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) .
Four of the five patients who required dialysis at baseline were able to discontinue dialysis .
Reduction in terminal complement activity and an increase in platelet count relative to baseline were observed after commencement of Soliris .
Soliris reduced signs of complement - mediated TMA activity , as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline to 26 weeks .
In Study C08 - 002 A / B , mean platelet count ( ± SD ) increased from 109 ± 32 × 109 / L at baseline to 169 ± 72 × 109 / L by one week ; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks ( 210 ± 68 × 109 / L ) , and 2 years ( 205 ± 46 × 109 / L ) .
When treatment was continued for more than 26 weeks , two additional patients achieved Hematologic Normalization as well as Complete TMA response .
Hematologic Normalization and Complete TMA response were maintained by all responders .
In Study C08 - 002 A / B , responses to Soliris were similar in patients with and without identified mutations in genes encoding complement regulatory factor proteins .

[ 3 ] In Study C08 - 003 A / B , 85 % of patients had normal platelet counts and 80 % of patients had normal serum LDH levels at baseline , so hematologic normalization in this population reflects maintenance of normal parameters in the absence of PE / PI .
[ 4 ] Calculated at each post - dose day of measurement ( excluding Days 1 to 4 ) using a repeated measurement ANOVA model .
Retrospective Study in Patients with aHUS ( C09 - 001 r ) The efficacy results for the aHUS retrospective study ( Study C09 - 001 r ) were generally consistent with results of the two prospective studies .
Soliris reduced signs of complement - mediated TMA activity , as shown by an increase in mean platelet counts from baseline .
Mean platelet count ( ± SD ) increased from 171 ± 83 × 109 / L at baseline to 233 ± 109 × 109 / L after one week of therapy ; this effect was maintained through 26 weeks ( mean platelet count ( ± SD ) at week 26 : 254 ± 79 × 109 / L ) .
A total of 19 pediatric patients ( ages 2 months to 17 years ) received Soliris in Study C09 - 001 r .
The median duration of Soliris therapy was 16 weeks ( range 4 to 70 weeks ) for children < 2 years of age ( n = 5 ) , 31 weeks ( range 19 to 63 weeks ) for children 2 to < 12 years of age ( n = 10 ) , and 38 weeks ( range 1 to 69 weeks ) for patients 12 to < 18 years of age ( n = 4 ) .
Fifty - three percent of pediatric patients had an identified complement regulatory factor mutation or auto - antibody .
Overall , the efficacy results for these pediatric patients appeared consistent with what was observed in patients enrolled in Studies C08 - 002 A / B and C08 - 003 A / B ( Table 16 ) .
No pediatric patient required new dialysis during treatment with Soliris .

14 . 3 Generalized Myasthenia Gravis ( gMG ) The efficacy of Soliris for the treatment of gMG was established in gMG Study 1 ( NCT01997229 ) , a 26 - week randomized , double - blind , parallel - group , placebo - controlled , multi - center trial that enrolled patients who met the following criteria at screening : • Positive serologic test for anti - AChR antibodies , • Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America ( MGFA ) Clinical Classification Class II to IV , • MG - Activities of Daily Living ( MG - ADL ) total score ≥ 6 , • Failed treatment over 1 year or more with 2 or more immunosuppressive therapies ( ISTs ) either in combination or as monotherapy , or failed at least 1 IST and required chronic plasmapheresis or plasma exchange ( PE ) or intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) .
A total of 62 patients were randomized to receive Soliris treatment and 63 were randomized to receive placebo .
Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups , including age at diagnosis ( 38 years in each group ) , gender [ 66 % female ( eculizumab ) versus 65 % female ( placebo ) ] , and duration of gMG [ 9 . 9 ( eculizumab ) versus 9 . 2 ( placebo ) years ] .
Over 95 % of patients in each group were receiving acetylcholinesterase ( AchE ) inhibitors , and 98 % were receiving immunosuppressant therapies ( ISTs ) .
Approximately 50 % of each group had been previously treated with at least 3 ISTs .
Soliris was administered according to the recommended dosage regimen [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
The primary efficacy endpoint for gMG Study 1 was a comparison of the change from baseline between treatment groups in the Myasthenia Gravis - Specific Activities of Daily Living scale ( MG - ADL ) total score at Week 26 .
The MG - ADL is a categorical scale that assesses the impact on daily function of 8 signs or symptoms that are typically affected in gMG .
Each item is assessed on a 4 - point scale where a score of 0 represents normal function and a score of 3 represents loss of ability to perform that function ( total score 0 - 24 ) .
A statistically significant difference favoring Soliris was observed in the mean change from baseline to Week 26 in MG - ADL total scores [ - 4 . 2 points in the Soliris - treated group compared with - 2 . 3 points in the placebo - treated group ( p = 0 . 006 ) ] .
A key secondary endpoint in gMG Study 1 was the change from baseline in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis ( QMG ) total score at Week 26 .
The QMG is a 13 - item categorical scale assessing muscle weakness .
Each item is assessed on a 4 - point scale where a score of 0 represents no weakness and a score of 3 represents severe weakness ( total score 0 - 39 ) .
A statistically significant difference favoring Soliris was observed in the mean change from baseline to Week 26 in QMG total scores [ - 4 . 6 points in the Soliris - treated group compared with - 1 . 6 points in the placebo - treated group ( p = 0 . 001 ) ] .
The results of the analysis of the MG - ADL and QMG from gMG Study 1 are shown in Table 21 .
Table 21 : Analysis of Change from Baseline to Week 26 in MG - ADL and QMG Total Scores in gMG Study 1 Efficacy Endpoints Soliris - LS Mean ( N = 62 ) ( SEM ) Placebo - LS Mean ( N = 63 ) ( SEM ) Soliris change relative to placebo – LS Mean Difference ( 95 % CI ) p - values SEM = Standard Error of the Mean ; Soliris - LSMean = least square mean for the treatment group ; Placebo - LSMean = least square mean for the placebo group ; LSMean - Difference ( 95 % CI ) = Difference in least square mean with 95 % confidence interval ; p - values ( testing the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two treatment arms MG - ADL - 4 . 2 ( 0 . 49 ) - 2 . 3 ( 0 . 48 ) - 1 . 9 ( - 3 . 3 , - 0 . 6 ) ( 0 . 006 [ 1 ] ; 0 . 014 [ 2 ] ) QMG - 4 . 6 ( 0 . 60 ) - 1 . 6 ( 0 . 59 ) - 3 . 0 ( - 4 . 6 , - 1 . 3 ) ( 0 . 001 null ; 0 . 005 null ) [ 1 ] in least square means at Week 26 using a repeated measure analysis ; [ 2 ] in ranks at Week 26 using a worst rank analysis ) .
In gMG Study 1 , a clinical response was defined in the MG - ADL total score as at least a 3 - point improvement and in QMG total score as at least a 5 - point improvement .
The proportion of clinical responders at Week 26 with no rescue therapy was statistically significantly higher for Soliris compared to placebo for both measures .
For both endpoints , and also at higher response thresholds ( ≥ 4 - , 5 - , 6 - , 7 - , or 8 - point improvement on MG - ADL , and ≥ 6 - , 7 - , 8 - , 9 - , or 10 - point improvement on QMG ) , the proportion of clinical responders was consistently greater for Soliris compared to placebo .
Available data suggest that clinical response is usually achieved by 12 weeks of Soliris treatment .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 4 Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder ( NMOSD ) The efficacy of Soliris for the treatment of NMOSD was established in NMOSD Study 1 ( NCT01892345 ) , a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial that enrolled 143 patients with NMOSD who were anti - AQP4 antibody positive and met the following criteria at screening : • History of at least 2 relapses in last 12 months or 3 relapses in the last 24 months , with at least 1 relapse in the 12 months prior to screening , • Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) score ≤ 7 ( consistent with the presence of at least limited ambulation with aid ) , • If on immunosuppressive therapy ( IST ) , on a stable dose regimen , • The use of concurrent corticosteroids was limited to 20 mg per day or less , • Patients were excluded if they had been treated with rituximab or mitoxantrone within 3 months or with IVIg within 3 weeks prior to screening .
A total of 96 patients were randomized to receive Soliris treatment and 47 were randomized to receive placebo .
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between treatment groups .
During the treatment phase of the trial , 76 % percent of patients received concomitant IST , including chronic corticosteroids ; 24 % of patients did not receive concomitant IST or chronic corticosteroids during the treatment phase of the trial .
Soliris was administered according to the recommended dosage regimen [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
The primary endpoint for NMOSD Study 1 was the time to the first adjudicated on - trial relapse .
The time to the first adjudicated on - trial relapse was significantly longer in Soliris - treated patients compared to placebo - treated patients ( relative risk reduction 94 % ; hazard ratio 0 . 058 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) ( Figure 1 ) .
Figure 1 : Kaplan - Meier Survival Estimates for Time to First Adjudicated On - Trial Relapse – Full Analysis Set [ MULTIMEDIA ] Note : Patients who did not experience an adjudicated on - trial relapse were censored at the end of the study period .
Abbreviations : CI = confidence interval Soliris - treated patients experienced similar improvement in time to first adjudicated on - trial relapse with or without concomitant treatment .
Soliris - treated patients had a 96 % relative reduction in the adjudicated on - trial annualized relapse rate ( ARR ) compared to patients on placebo , as shown in Table 22 .

SOLIRIS is a medicine that affects your immune system .
SOLIRIS can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections .
• SOLIRIS increases your chance of getting serious and life - threatening meningococcal infections .
Meningococcal infections may quickly become life - threatening and cause death if not recognized and treated early .
• 1 .
You must receive meningococcal vaccines at least 2 weeks before your first dose of SOLIRIS if you have not already had this vaccine .
• 2 .
If your doctor decided that urgent treatment with SOLIRIS is needed , you should receive meningococcal vaccination as soon as possible .
• 3 .
If you have not been vaccinated and SOLIRIS therapy must be initiated immediately , you should also receive two weeks of antibiotics with your vaccinations .
• 4 .
If you had a meningococcal vaccine in the past , you might need additional vaccination before starting SOLIRIS .
Your doctor will decide if you need additional meningococcal vaccination .
• 5 .
Meningococcal vaccines reduce the risk of meningococcal infection but do not prevent all meningococcal infections .
Call your doctor or get emergency medical care right away if you get any of these signs and symptoms of a meningococcal infection : • headache with nausea or vomiting • headache with a stiff neck or stiff back • fever and a rash • muscle aches with flu - like symptoms • headache and fever • fever • confusion • eyes sensitive to light Your doctor will give you a Patient Safety Card about the risk of meningococcal infection .
Carry it with you at all times during treatment and for 3 months after your last SOLIRIS dose .
Your risk of meningococcal infection may continue for several weeks after your last dose of SOLIRIS .
It is important to show this card to any doctor or nurse who treats you .
This will help them diagnose and treat you quickly .
SOLIRIS is only available through a program called the SOLIRIS REMS .
Before you can receive SOLIRIS , your doctor must : • enroll in the SOLIRIS REMS program • counsel you about the risk of meningococcal infection • give you information about the symptoms of meningococcal infection • give you a Patient Safety Card about your risk of meningococcal infection , as discussed above • make sure that you are vaccinated with the meningococcal vaccine and , if needed , get revaccinated with the meningococcal vaccine .
Ask your doctor if you are not sure if you need to be revaccinated .
SOLIRIS may also increase the risk of other types of serious infections .
If your child is treated with SOLIRIS , make sure that your child receives vaccinations against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilis influenzae type b ( Hib ) .
Certain people may be at risk of serious infections with gonorrhea .
Talk to your doctor about whether you are at risk for gonorrhea infection , about gonorrhea prevention , and regular testing .
Certain fungal infections ( aspergillus ) may also happen if you take SOLIRIS and have a weak immune system or a low white blood cell count .
What is SOLIRIS ?
SOLIRIS is a prescription medicine called a monoclonal antibody .
SOLIRIS is used to treat : • patients - with a disease called Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) .
