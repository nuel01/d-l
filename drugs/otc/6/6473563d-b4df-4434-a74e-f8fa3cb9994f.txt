1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE AGGRENOX is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients who have had transient ischemia of the brain or completed ischemic stroke due to thrombosis .
AGGRENOX is a combination antiplatelet agent indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients who have had transient ischemia of the brain or completed ischemic stroke due to thrombosis ( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION AGGRENOX is not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets .
The recommended dose of AGGRENOX is one capsule given orally twice daily , one in the morning and one in the evening .
Swallow capsules whole without chewing .
AGGRENOX can be administered with or without food .
• One capsule twice daily ( morning and evening ) with or without food ( 2 ) • In case of intolerable headaches during initial treatment , switch to one capsule at bedtime and low - dose aspirin in the morning ; resume BID dosing within one week ( 2 ) • Do not chew capsule ( 2 ) • Not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets ( 2 ) • Dispense in this unit - of - use container ( 16 ) 2 . 1 Alternative Regimen in Case of Intolerable Headaches In the event of intolerable headaches during initial treatment , switch to one capsule at bedtime and low - dose aspirin in the morning .
Because there are no outcome data with this regimen and headaches become less of a problem as treatment continues , patients should return to the usual regimen as soon as possible , usually within one week .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS 25 mg / 200 mg capsules with a red cap and an ivory - colored body , containing yellow extended - release pellets incorporating dipyridamole and a round white tablet incorporating immediate - release aspirin .
The capsule body is imprinted in red with the Boehringer Ingelheim logo and with " 01 A " .
• Capsule : 25 mg aspirin / 200 mg extended - release dipyridamole ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Hypersensitivity to any product ingredients ( 4 . 1 ) • Patients with known allergy to NSAIDs ( 4 . 2 ) • Patients with the syndrome of asthma , rhinitis , and nasal polyps ( 4 . 2 ) 4 . 1 Hypersensitivity AGGRENOX is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the product components .
4 . 2 Allergy Aspirin is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug products and in patients with the syndrome of asthma , rhinitis , and nasal polyps .
Aspirin may cause severe urticaria , angioedema or bronchospasm .
4 . 3 Reye Syndrome Do not use aspirin in children or teenagers with viral infections because of the risk of Reye syndrome .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • The risk of GI bleeding is increased , especially in patients who are heavy alcohol users , have a history of peptic ulcer , or have coagulation abnormalities due to liver disease or vitamin K deficiency ( 5 . 1 ) • As with other antiplatelets , there is a risk of intracranial hemorrhage ( 5 . 1 ) • Avoid use in patients with severe hepatic or renal insufficiency ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 3 ) • Can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman , especially in the third trimester ( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Risk of Bleeding Intracranial Hemorrhage In ESPS2 the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0 . 6 % in the AGGRENOX group , 0 . 5 % in the extended - release dipyridamole ( ER - DP ) group , 0 . 4 % in the aspirin ( ASA ) group and 0 . 4 % in the placebo groups .
Coagulation Abnormalities Even low doses of aspirin can inhibit platelet function leading to an increase in bleeding time .
This can adversely affect patients with inherited or acquired ( liver disease or vitamin K deficiency ) bleeding disorders [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) ] .
Gastrointestinal ( GI ) Side Effects GI side effects include stomach pain , heartburn , nausea , vomiting , and gross GI bleeding .
Although minor upper GI symptoms , such as dyspepsia , are common and can occur anytime during therapy , physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding , even in the absence of previous GI symptoms .
Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur .
In ESPS2 the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was 4 . 1 % in the AGGRENOX group , 2 . 2 % in the extended - release dipyridamole group , 3 . 2 % in the aspirin group , and 2 . 1 % in the placebo groups .
Peptic Ulcer Disease Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease , which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding .
Alcohol Warning Because AGGRENOX contains aspirin , counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic , heavy alcohol use while taking aspirin .
5 . 2 Renal Failure Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure ( glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL / minute ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 3 Hepatic Insufficiency Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 4 Pregnancy Because AGGRENOX contains aspirin , AGGRENOX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Maternal aspirin use during later stages of pregnancy may cause low birth weight , increased incidence for intracranial hemorrhage in premature infants , stillbirths and neonatal death .
Because of the above and because of the known effects of nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) on the fetal cardiovascular system ( closure of the ductus arteriosus ) , avoid AGGRENOX in the third trimester of pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Aspirin has been shown to be teratogenic in rats ( spina bifida , exencephaly , microphthalmia and coelosomia ) and rabbits ( congested fetuses , agenesis of skull and upper jaw , generalized edema with malformation of the head , and diaphanous skin ) at oral doses of 330 mg / kg / day and 110 mg / kg / day , respectively .
These doses , which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats ( 63 % of implantations versus 5 % in controls ) , are , on a mg / m2 basis , about 66 and 44 times , respectively , the dose of aspirin contained in the maximum recommended daily human dose of AGGRENOX .
Reproduction studies with dipyridamole have been performed in mice , rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg / kg , 40 mg / kg and 1000 mg / kg , respectively ( about 1 ½ , 2 and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose , respectively , on a mg / m2 basis ) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole .
When 330 mg aspirin / kg / day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole / kg / day in the rat , the resorption rate approached 100 % , indicating potentiation of aspirin - related fetal toxicity .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of the use of AGGRENOX in pregnant women .
If AGGRENOX is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking AGGRENOX , inform the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus .
5 . 5 Coronary Artery Disease Dipyridamole has a vasodilatory effect .
Chest pain may be precipitated or aggravated in patients with underlying coronary artery disease who are receiving dipyridamole .
For stroke or TIA patients for whom aspirin is indicated to prevent recurrent myocardial infarction ( MI ) or angina pectoris , the aspirin in this product may not provide adequate treatment for the cardiac indications .
5 . 6 Hypotension Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation , which can exacerbate pre - existing hypotension .
5 . 7 General AGGRENOX capsules are not interchangeable with the individual components of aspirin and dipyridamole tablets .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling : • Hypersensitivity [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 1 ) ] .
• Allergy [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 2 ) ] .
• Risk of Bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
• The most frequently reported adverse reactions ( > 10 % and greater than placebo ) were headache , dyspepsia , abdominal pain , nausea , and diarrhea ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals , Inc . at ( 800 ) 542 - 6257 or ( 800 ) 459 - 9906 TTY or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The efficacy and safety of AGGRENOX was established in the European Stroke Prevention Study - 2 ( ESPS2 ) .
ESPS2 was a double - blind , placebo controlled study that evaluated 6602 patients over the age of 18 years who had a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack within ninety days prior to entry .
Patients were randomized to either AGGRENOX , aspirin , ER - DP , or placebo [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] ; primary endpoints included stroke ( fatal or nonfatal ) and death from all causes .
This 24 - month , multicenter , double - blind , randomized study ( ESPS2 ) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of AGGRENOX with placebo , extended - release dipyridamole alone and aspirin alone .
The study was conducted in a total of 6602 male and female patients who had experienced a previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemia of the brain within three months prior to randomization .
Table 1 presents the incidence of adverse events that occurred in 1 % or more of patients treated with AGGRENOX where the incidence was also greater than in those patients treated with placebo .
There is no clear benefit of the dipyridamole / aspirin combination over aspirin with respect to safety .

Other Adverse Events Adverse reactions that occurred in less than 1 % of patients treated with AGGRENOX in the ESPS2 study and that were medically judged to be possibly related to either dipyridamole or aspirin are listed below .
Body as a Whole : Allergic reaction , fever Cardiovascular : Hypotension Central Nervous System : Coma , dizziness , paresthesia , cerebral hemorrhage , intracranial hemorrhage , subarachnoid hemorrhage Gastrointestinal : Gastritis , ulceration and perforation Hearing and Vestibular Disorders : Tinnitus , and deafness .
Patients with high frequency hearing loss may have difficulty perceiving tinnitus .
In these patients , tinnitus cannot be used as a clinical indicator of salicylism Heart Rate and Rhythm Disorders : Tachycardia , palpitation , arrhythmia , supraventricular tachycardia Liver and Biliary System Disorders : Cholelithiasis , jaundice , hepatic function abnormal Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders : Hyperglycemia , thirst Platelet , Bleeding and Clotting Disorders : Hematoma , gingival bleeding Psychiatric Disorders : Agitation Reproductive : Uterine hemorrhage Respiratory : Hyperpnea , asthma , bronchospasm , hemoptysis , pulmonary edema Special Senses Other Disorders : Taste loss Skin and Appendages Disorders : Pruritus , urticaria Urogenital : Renal insufficiency and failure , hematuria Vascular ( Extracardiac ) Disorders : Flushing Laboratory Changes Over the course of the 24 - month study ( ESPS2 ) , patients treated with AGGRENOX showed a decline ( mean change from baseline ) in hemoglobin of 0 . 25 g / dL , hematocrit of 0 . 75 % , and erythrocyte count of 0 . 13x106 / mm3 .
6 . 2 Post - Marketing Experience The following is a list of additional adverse reactions that have been reported either in the literature or are from post - marketing spontaneous reports for either dipyridamole or aspirin .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to estimate reliably their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Decisions to include these reactions in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors : ( 1 ) seriousness of the reaction , ( 2 ) frequency of reporting , or ( 3 ) strength of causal connection to AGGRENOX .
Body as a Whole : Hypothermia , chest pain Cardiovascular : Angina pectoris Central Nervous System : Cerebral edema Fluid and Electrolyte : Hyperkalemia , metabolic acidosis , respiratory alkalosis , hypokalemia Gastrointestinal : Pancreatitis , Reye syndrome , hematemesis Hearing and Vestibular Disorders : Hearing loss Immune System Disorders : Hypersensitivity , acute anaphylaxis , laryngeal edema Liver and Biliary System Disorders : Hepatitis , hepatic failure Musculoskeletal : Rhabdomyolysis Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders : Hypoglycemia , dehydration Platelet , Bleeding and Clotting Disorders : Prolongation of the prothrombin time , disseminated intravascular coagulation , coagulopathy , thrombocytopenia Reproductive : Prolonged pregnancy and labor , stillbirths , lower birth weight infants , antepartum and postpartum bleeding Respiratory : Tachypnea , dyspnea Skin and Appendages Disorders : Rash , alopecia , angioedema , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , skin hemorrhages such as bruising , ecchymosis , and hematoma Urogenital : Interstitial nephritis , papillary necrosis , proteinuria Vascular ( Extracardiac Disorders ) : Allergic vasculitis Other adverse events : anorexia , aplastic anemia , migraine , pancytopenia , thrombocytosis .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No pharmacokinetic drug - drug interaction studies were conducted with AGGRENOX capsules .
The following information was obtained from the literature .
• Co - administration with anti - coagulants or NSAIDS can increase risk of bleeding ( 7 . 4 , 7 . 10 ) • Decreased renal function can occur with co - administration with NSAIDS ( 7 . 10 ) 7 . 1 Adenosine Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine .
Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary .
7 . 2 Angiotensin Converting Enzyme ( ACE ) Inhibitors Due to the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin - angiotensin conversion pathway , the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin .
7 . 3 Acetazolamide Concurrent use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide ( and toxicity ) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion .
7 . 4 Anticoagulant Therapy ( heparin and warfarin ) Patients on anticoagulation therapy are at increased risk for bleeding because of drug - drug interactions and effects on platelets .
Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites , leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time .
Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin , increasing bleeding risk .
7 . 5 Anticonvulsants Salicylic acid can displace protein - bound phenytoin and valproic acid , leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels .
7 . 6 Beta Blockers The hypotensive effects of beta blockers may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins , leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention .
7 . 7 Cholinesterase Inhibitors Dipyridamole may counteract the anticholinesterase effect of cholinesterase inhibitors , thereby potentially aggravating myasthenia gravis .
7 . 8 Diuretics The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by the concomitant administration of aspirin due to inhibition of renal prostaglandins , leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention .
7 . 9 Methotrexate Salicylate can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate , leading to bone marrow toxicity , especially in the elderly or renal impaired .
7 . 10 Nonsteroidal Anti - Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) The concurrent use of aspirin with other NSAIDs may increase bleeding or lead to decreased renal function .
7 . 11 Oral Hypoglycemics Moderate doses of aspirin may increase the effectiveness of oral hypoglycemic drugs , leading to hypoglycemia .
7 . 12 Uricosuric Agents ( probenecid and sulfinpyrazone ) Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of uricosuric agents .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy Category D ( 8 . 1 ) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION and FDA - approved patient labeling 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects , Pregnancy Category D . [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
8 . 2 Labor and Delivery Aspirin can result in excessive blood loss at delivery as well as prolonged gestation and prolonged labor .
Because of these effects on the mother and because of adverse fetal effects seen with aspirin during the later stages of pregnancy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] , avoid AGGRENOX in the third trimester of pregnancy and during labor and delivery .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Both dipyridamole and aspirin are excreted in human milk .
Exercise caution when AGGRENOX capsules are administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of AGGRENOX in pediatric patients have not been studied .
Due to the aspirin component , use of this product in the pediatric population is not recommended [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in ESPS2 , 61 percent were 65 and over , while 27 percent were 75 and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Patients with Severe Hepatic or Severe Renal Dysfunction AGGRENOX has not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment .
Avoid using aspirin containing products , such as Aggrenox in patients with severe hepatic or severe renal ( glomerular filtration rate < 10 mL / min ) dysfunction [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Because of the dose ratio of dipyridamole to aspirin , overdosage of AGGRENOX is likely to be dominated by signs and symptoms of dipyridamole overdose .
In case of real or suspected overdose , seek medical attention or contact a Poison Control Center immediately .
Careful medical management is essential .
Based upon the known hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole , symptoms such as warm feeling , flushes , sweating , restlessness , feeling of weakness and dizziness may occur .
A drop in blood pressure and tachycardia might also be observed .
Salicylate toxicity may result from acute ingestion ( overdose ) or chronic intoxication .
Severity of aspirin intoxication is determined by measuring the blood salicylate level .
The early signs of salicylic overdose ( salicylism ) , including tinnitus ( ringing in the ears ) , occur at plasma concentrations approaching 200 µg / mL .
In severe cases , hyperthermia and hypovolemia are the major immediate threats to life .
Plasma concentrations of aspirin above 300 µg / mL are clearly toxic .
Severe toxic effects are associated with levels above 400 µg / mL .
A single lethal dose of aspirin in adults is not known with certainty but death may be expected at 30 g . Treatment of overdose consists primarily of supporting vital functions , increasing drug elimination , and correcting acid - base disturbances .
Consider gastric emptying and / or lavage as soon as possible after ingestion , even if the patient has vomited spontaneously .
After lavage and / or emesis , administration of activated charcoal as a slurry may be beneficial if less than 3 hours have passed since ingestion .
Charcoal absorption should not be employed prior to emesis and lavage .
Follow acid base status closely with serial blood gas and serum pH measurements .
Maintain fluid and electrolyte balance .
Administer replacement fluid intravenously and augment with correction of acidosis .
Treatment may require the use of a vasopressor .
Infusion of glucose may be required to control hypoglycemia .
Administration of xanthine derivatives ( e . g . , aminophylline ) may reverse the hemodynamic effects of dipyridamole overdose .
Plasma electrolytes and pH should be monitored serially to promote alkaline diuresis of salicylate if renal function is normal .
In patients with renal insufficiency or in cases of life - threatening intoxication , dialysis is usually required to treat salicylic overdose , however since dipyridamole is highly protein bound , dialysis is not likely to remove dipyridamole .
Exchange transfusion may be indicated in infants and young children .

Dipyridamole Dipyridamole is an antiplatelet agent chemically described as 2 , 2 ' , 2 '' , 2 ''' - [ ( 4 , 8 - Dipiperidinopyrimido [ 5 , 4 - d ] pyrimidine - 2 , 6 - diyl ) dinitrilo ] - tetraethanol .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Dipyridamole is an odorless yellow crystalline substance , having a bitter taste .
It is soluble in dilute acids , methanol and chloroform , and is practically insoluble in water .
Aspirin The antiplatelet agent aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid ) is chemically known as benzoic acid , 2 - ( acetyloxy ) - , and has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Aspirin is an odorless white needle - like crystalline or powdery substance .
When exposed to moisture , aspirin hydrolyzes into salicylic and acetic acids , and gives off a vinegary odor .
It is highly lipid soluble and slightly soluble in water .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The antithrombotic action of AGGRENOX is the result of the additive antiplatelet effects of dipyridamole and aspirin .
Dipyridamole Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets , endothelial cells and erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo ; the inhibition occurs in a dose - dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations ( 0 . 5 - 1 . 9 µg / mL ) .
This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which acts on the platelet A2 - receptor thereby stimulating platelet adenylate cyclase and increasing platelet cyclic - 3 ' , 5 ' - adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) levels .
Via this mechanism , platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor ( PAF ) , collagen and adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) .
Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase ( PDE ) in various tissues .
While the inhibition of cAMP - PDE is weak , therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic - 3 ' , 5 ' - guanosine monophosphate - PDE ( cGMP - PDE ) , thereby augmenting the increase in cGMP produced by EDRF ( endothelium - derived relaxing factor , now identified as nitric oxide ) .
Aspirin Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversible inhibition of platelet cyclooxygenase and thus inhibits the generation of thromboxane A2 , a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The effect of either agent on the other ' s inhibition of platelet reactivity has not been evaluated .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics There are no significant interactions between aspirin and dipyridamole .
The kinetics of the components are unchanged by their co - administration as AGGRENOX .
Dipyridamole Absorption Peak plasma levels of dipyridamole are achieved 2 hours ( range 1 - 6 hours ) after administration of a daily dose of 400 mg AGGRENOX ( given as 200 mg BID ) .
The peak plasma concentration at steady - state is 1 . 98 µg / mL ( 1 . 01 - 3 . 99 µg / mL ) and the steady - state trough concentration is 0 . 53 µg / mL ( 0 . 18 – 1 . 01 µg / mL ) .
Effect of Food When AGGRENOX capsules were taken with a high fat meal , dipyridamole peak plasma levels ( Cmax ) and total absorption ( AUC ) were decreased at steady - state by 20 - 30 % compared to fasting .
Due to the similar degree of inhibition of adenosine uptake at these plasma concentrations , this food effect is not considered clinically relevant .
Distribution Dipyridamole is highly lipophilic ( log P = 3 . 71 , pH = 7 ) ; however , it has been shown that the drug does not cross the blood - brain barrier to any significant extent in animals .
The steady - state volume of distribution of dipyridamole is about 92 L . Approximately 99 % of dipyridamole is bound to plasma proteins , predominantly to alpha 1 - acid glycoprotein and albumin .
Metabolism and Elimination Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver , primarily by conjugation with glucuronic acid , of which monoglucuronide which has low pharmacodynamic activity is the primary metabolite .
In plasma , about 80 % of the total amount is present as parent compound and 20 % as monoglucuronide .
Most of the glucuronide metabolite ( about 95 % ) is excreted via bile into the feces , with some evidence of enterohepatic circulation .
Renal excretion of parent compound is negligible and urinary excretion of the glucuronide metabolite is low ( about 5 % ) .
With intravenous ( i . v . ) treatment of dipyridamole , a triphasic profile is obtained : a rapid alpha phase , with a half - life of about 3 . 4 minutes , a beta phase , with a half - life of about 39 minutes , ( which , together with the alpha phase accounts for about 70 % of the total area under the curve , AUC ) and a prolonged elimination phase λz with a half - life of about 15 . 5 hours .
Due to the extended absorption phase of the dipyridamole component , only the terminal phase is apparent from oral treatment with AGGRENOX which , in Trial 9 . 123 was 13 . 6 hours .
Special Populations Geriatric Patients : In ESPS2 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] , plasma concentrations ( determined as AUC ) of dipyridamole in healthy elderly subjects ( > 65 years ) were about 40 % higher than in subjects younger than 55 years receiving treatment with AGGRENOX .
Hepatic Dysfunction : No study has been conducted with AGGRENOX in patients with hepatic dysfunction .
In a study conducted with an intravenous formulation of dipyridamole , patients with mild to severe hepatic insufficiency showed no change in plasma concentrations of dipyridamole but showed an increase in the pharmacologically inactive monoglucuronide metabolite .
Dipyridamole can be dosed without restriction as long as there is no evidence of hepatic failure .
Renal Dysfunction : No study has been conducted with AGGRENOX in patients with renal dysfunction .
In ESPS2 patients [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] , with creatinine clearances ranging from about 15 mL / min to > 100 mL / min , no changes were observed in the pharmacokinetics of dipyridamole or its glucuronide metabolite if data were corrected for differences in age .
Aspirin Absorption Peak plasma levels of aspirin are achieved 0 . 63 hours ( 0 . 5 – 1 hour ) after administration of a 50 mg aspirin daily dose from AGGRENOX ( given as 25 mg BID ) .
The peak plasma concentration at steady - state is 319 ng / mL ( 175 – 463 ng / mL ) .
Aspirin undergoes moderate hydrolysis to salicylic acid in the liver and the gastrointestinal wall , with 50 % – 75 % of an administered dose reaching the systemic circulation as intact aspirin .
Effect of Food When AGGRENOX capsules were taken with a high fat meal , there was no difference for aspirin in AUC at steady - state , and the approximately 50 % decrease in Cmax was not considered clinically relevant based on a similar degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition comparing the fed and fasted state .
Distribution Aspirin is poorly bound to plasma proteins and its apparent volume of distribution is low ( 10 L ) .
Its metabolite , salicylic acid , is highly bound to plasma proteins , but its binding is concentration - dependent ( nonlinear ) .
At low concentrations ( < 100 µg / mL ) , approximately 90 % of salicylic acid is bound to albumin .
Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues and fluids in the body , including the central nervous system , breast milk , and fetal tissues .
Early signs of salicylate overdose ( salicylism ) , including tinnitus ( ringing in the ears ) , occur at plasma concentrations approximating 200 µg / mL [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
Metabolism and Elimination Aspirin is rapidly hydrolyzed in plasma to salicylic acid , with a half - life of 20 minutes .
Plasma levels of aspirin are essentially undetectable 2 - 2 . 5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour ( range : 0 . 5 - 2 hours ) after administration of aspirin .
Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid , a phenolic glucuronide , an acyl glucuronide , and a number of minor metabolites .
Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide .
Following toxic doses ( 10 - 20 g ) , the plasma half - life may be increased to over 20 hours .
The elimination of acetylsalicylic acid follows first - order kinetics with AGGRENOX and has a half - life of 0 . 33 hours .
The half - life of salicylic acid is 1 . 71 hours .
Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half - life of approximately 2 - 3 hours .
At higher doses , the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero - order kinetics ( i . e . , the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration ) , with an apparent half - life of 6 hours or higher .
Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH . As urinary pH rises above 6 . 5 , the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from < 5 % to > 80 % .
Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose [ see Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
Following therapeutic doses , about 10 % is excreted as salicylic acid and 75 % as salicyluric acid , as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides , in urine .
Special Populations Hepatic Dysfunction : Avoid aspirin in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency .
Renal Dysfunction : Avoid aspirin in patients with severe renal failure ( glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL / min ) .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In studies in which dipyridamole was administered in the feed to mice ( up to 111 weeks in males and females ) and rats ( up to 128 weeks in males and up to 142 weeks in females ) , there was no evidence of drug - related carcinogenesis .
The highest dose administered in these studies ( 75 mg / kg / day ) was , on a mg / m2 basis , about equivalent to the maximum recommended daily human oral dose ( MRHD ) in mice and about twice the MRHD in rats .
Combinations of dipyridamole and aspirin ( 1 : 5 ratio ) tested negative in the Ames test , in vivo chromosome aberration tests ( in mice and hamsters ) , oral micronucleus tests ( in mice and hamsters ) and oral dominant lethal test ( in mice ) .
Aspirin , alone , induced chromosome aberrations in cultured human fibroblasts .
Mutagenicity tests of dipyridamole alone with bacterial and mammalian cell systems were negative .
Combinations of dipyridamole and aspirin have not been evaluated for effects on fertility and reproductive performance .
There was no evidence of impaired fertility when dipyridamole was administered to male and female rats at oral doses up to 500 mg / kg / day ( about 12 times the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis ) .
A significant reduction in number of corpora lutea with consequent reduction in implantations and live fetuses was , however , observed at 1250 mg / kg ( more than 30 times the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Aspirin inhibits ovulation in rats .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES ESPS2 ( European Stroke Prevention Study 2 ) was a double - blind , placebo - controlled , 24 - month study in which 6602 patients over the age of 18 years had an ischemic stroke ( 76 % ) or transient ischemic attack ( TIA , 24 % ) within three months prior to entry .
Patients were enrolled in 13 European countries between February 1989 and May 1995 and were randomized to one of four treatment groups : AGGRENOX ( aspirin / extended - release dipyridamole ) 25 mg / 200 mg ; extended - release dipyridamole ( ER - DP ) 200 mg alone ; aspirin ( ASA ) 25 mg alone ; or placebo .
The mean age in this population was 66 . 7 years with 58 % of them being males .
Patients received one capsule twice daily ( morning and evening ) .
Efficacy assessments included analyses of stroke ( fatal or nonfatal ) and death ( from all causes ) as confirmed by a blinded morbidity and mortality assessment group .
There were no differences with regard to efficacy based on age or gender ; patients who were older had a trend towards more events .
Stroke Endpoint AGGRENOX reduced the risk of stroke by 22 . 1 % compared to aspirin 50 mg / day alone ( p = 0 . 008 ) and reduced the risk of stroke by 24 . 4 % compared to extended - release dipyridamole 400 mg / day alone ( p = 0 . 002 ) ( Table 4 ) .
AGGRENOX reduced the risk of stroke by 36 . 8 % compared to placebo ( p < 0 . 001 ) .

These results were not statistically significant .
AGGRENOX reduced the risk of stroke or death by 24 . 2 % compared to placebo .
Death Endpoint The incidence rate of all cause mortality was 11 . 3 % for AGGRENOX , 11 . 0 % for aspirin alone , 11 . 4 % for extended - release dipyridamole alone and 12 . 3 % for placebo alone .
The differences between the AGGRENOX , aspirin alone and extended - release dipyridamole alone treatment groups were not statistically significant .
These incidence rates for AGGRENOX and aspirin alone are consistent with previous aspirin studies in stroke and TIA patients .
