Topical Gel : clindamycin ( 1 % ) as clindamycin phosphate , benzoyl peroxide ( 5 % ) For Dermatological Use Only - Not for Ophthalmic Use * Mix Before Dispensing DESCRIPTION Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % contains clindamycin phosphate , ( 7 ( S ) - chloro - 7 - deoxylincomycin - 2 - phosphate ) .
Clindamycin phosphate is a water soluble ester of the semi - synthetic antibiotic produced by a 7 ( S ) - chloro - substitution of the 7 ( R ) - hydroxyl group of the parent antibiotic lincomycin .
Chemically , clindamycin phosphate is ( C18H34ClN2O8PS ) .
The structural formula for clindamycin is represented below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Clindamycin phosphate has molecular weight of 504 . 97 and its chemical name is Methyl 7 - chloro - 6 , 7 , 8 - trideoxy - 6 - ( 1 - methyl - trans - 4 - propyl - L - 2 - pyrrolidinecarboxamido ) - 1 - thio - L - threo - alpha - D - galacto - octopyranoside 2 - ( dihydrogen phosphate ) .
Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % also contains benzoyl peroxide , for topical use .
Chemically , benzoyl peroxide is ( C14H10O4 ) .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Benzoyl peroxide has a molecular weight of 242 . 23 .
Each gram of Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % contains , as dispensed , 10 mg ( 1 % ) clindamycin as phosphate and 50 mg ( 5 % ) benzoyl peroxide in a base of carbomer homopolymer type C , potassium hydroxide , propylene glycol , and purified water .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY An in vitro percutaneous penetration study comparing Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % and topical 1 % clindamycin gel alone , demonstrated there was no statistical difference in penetration between the two drugs .
Mean systemic bioavailability of topical clindamycin in Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % is suggested to be less than 1 % .
Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid .
Less than 2 % of the dose enters systemic circulation as benzoic acid .
It is suggested that the lipophilic nature of benzoyl peroxide acts to concentrate the compound into the lipid - rich sebaceous follicle .
Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics ( plasma and urine ) of clindamycin from Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % was studied in male and female patients ( n = 13 ) with acne vulgaris .
Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % ( ~ 2 g ) was applied topically to the face and back twice daily for four and a half ( 4 . 5 ) days .
Quantifiable ( > LOQ = 1 ng / mL ) clindamycin plasma concentrations were obtained in six of thirteen subjects ( 46 . 2 % ) on Day 1 and twelve of thirteen subjects ( 92 . 3 % ) on Day 5 .
Peak plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) of clindamycin ranged from 1 . 47 ng / mL to 2 . 77 ng / mL on Day 1 and 1 . 43 ng / mL to 7 . 18 ng / mL on Day 5 .
The AUC ( 0 - 12 h ) ranged from 2 . 74 ng . h / mL to 12 . 86 ng . h / mL on Day 1 and 11 . 4 ng . h / mL to 69 . 7 ng . h / mL on Day 5 .
The amount of clindamycin excreted in the urine during the 12 hour dosing interval increased from a mean ( SD ) of 5745 ( 3130 ) ng on Day 1 to 12069 ( 7660 ) ng on Day 5 .
The mean % ( SD ) of the administered dose that was excreted in the urine ranged from 0 . 03 % ( 0 . 02 ) to 0 . 08 % ( 0 . 04 ) .
A comparison of the single ( Day 1 ) and multiple ( Day 5 ) dose plasma and urinary concentrations of clindamycin indicates that there is accumulation of clindamycin following multiple dosing of Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % .
The degree of accumulation calculated from the plasma and urinary excretion data was ~ 2 - fold .
Microbiology The clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide components individually have been shown to have in vitro activity against Propionibacterium acnes an organism which has been associated with acne vulgaris ; however , the clinical significance of this activity against P . acnes was not examined in clinical trials with this product .
CLINICAL STUDIES In two adequate and well controlled clinical studies of 758 patients , 214 used Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % , 210 used benzoyl peroxide , 168 used clindamycin , and 166 used vehicle .
Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % applied twice daily for 10 weeks was significantly more effective than vehicle in the treatment of moderate to moderately severe facial acne vulgaris .
Patients were evaluated and acne lesions counted at each clinical visit ; weeks 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 and 10 .
The primary efficacy measures were the lesion counts and the investigator ' s global assessment evaluated at week 10 .
Patients were instructed to wash the face with a mild soap , using only the hands .
Fifteen minutes after the face was thoroughly dry , application was made to the entire face .
Non - medicated make - up could be applied at one hour after the Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % application .
If a moisturizer was required , the patients were provided a moisturizer to be used as needed .
Patients were instructed to avoid sun exposure .
Percent reductions in lesion counts after treatment for 10 weeks in these two studies are shown below : Study 1 Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % n = 120 Benzoyl Peroxide n = 120 Clindamycin n = 120 Vehicle N = 120 Mean percent reduction in inflammatory lesion counts 46 % 32 % 16 % + 3 % Mean percent reduction in non - inflammatory lesion counts 22 % 22 % 9 % + 1 % Mean percent reduction in total lesion counts 36 % 28 % 15 % 0 . 2 % Study 2 Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % n = 95 Benzoyl Peroxide n = 95 Clindamycin n = 49 Vehicle N = 48 Mean percent reduction in inflammatory lesion counts 63 % 53 % 45 % 42 % Mean percent reduction in non - inflammatory lesion counts 54 % 50 % 39 % 36 % Mean percent reduction in total lesion counts 58 % 52 % 42 % 39 % The Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % group showed greater overall improvement than the benzoyl peroxide , clindamycin and vehicle groups as rated by the investigator .

Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be a tumor promoter and progression agent in a number of animal studies .
The clinical significance of this is unknown .
Benzoyl peroxide in acetone at doses of 5 and 10 mg administered twice per week induced skin tumors in transgenic Tg . AC mice in a study using 20 weeks of topical treatment .
In a 52 week dermal photocarcinogenicity study in hairless mice , the median time to onset of skin tumor formation was decreased and the number of tumors per mouse increased following chronic concurrent topical administration of Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % with exposure to ultraviolet radiation ( 40 weeks of treatment followed by 12 weeks of observation ) .
In a 2 - year dermal carcinogenicity study in rats , treatment with Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % at doses of 100 , 500 and 2000 mg / kg / day caused a dose - dependent increase in the incidence of keratoacanthoma at the treated skin site of male rats .
The incidence of keratoacanthoma at the treated site of males treated with 2000 mg / kg / day ( 8 times the highest recommended adult human dose of 2 . 5 g Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % based on mg / m2 ) was statistically significantly higher than that in the sham - and vehicle - controls .
Genotoxicity studies were not conducted with Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % .
Clindamycin phosphate was not genotoxic in Salmonella typhimurium or in a rat micronucleus test .
Clindamycin phosphate sulfoxide , an oxidative degradation product of clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide , was not clastogenic in a mouse micronucleus test .
Benzoyl peroxide has been found to cause DNA strand breaks in a variety of mammalian cell types , to be mutagenic in S . typhimurium tests by some but not all investigators , and to cause sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells .
Studies have not been performed with Clindamycin and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 % / 5 % or benzoyl peroxide to evaluate the effect on fertility .
