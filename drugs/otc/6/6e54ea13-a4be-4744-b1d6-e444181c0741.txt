WARNING : POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATIONS OF HEPATITIS B Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are co - infected with hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV - 1 ) and have discontinued lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , components of CIMDUO .
Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and , if appropriate , initiate anti - hepatitis B treatment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
WARNING : POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATIONS OF HEPATITIS B See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning .
• • Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are co - infected with HBV and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV - 1 ) and have discontinued lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate .
Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and , if appropriate , initiate anti - hepatitis B treatment .
( 5 . 2 ) 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE CIMDUO ® ( lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ) is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) infection in adult and pediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg .
CIMDUO is a two - drug combination of lamivudine ( 3 TC ) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) , both nucleo ( t ) side reverse transcriptase inhibitors and is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) infection in adult and pediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • • Testing : Prior to initiation and during treatment with CIMDUO , patients should be tested for hepatitis B virus infection , and estimated creatinine clearance , urine glucose , and urine protein should be obtained .
( 2 . 1 ) • • Recommended dose : One tablet taken orally once daily with or without food .
( 2 . 2 ) • • Renal Impairment : Not recommended in patients with CrCL less than 50 mL / min or patients with end - stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis .
( 2 . 3 ) 2 . 1 Testing Prior to Initiation and During Treatment with CIMDUO Prior to initiation of CIMDUO , test patients for hepatitis B virus infection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
It is recommended that serum creatinine , serum phosphorus , estimated creatinine clearance , urine glucose , and urine protein be assessed before initiating CIMDUO and during therapy in all patients as clinically appropriate [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 2 Recommended Dosage for Adult and Pediatric Patients Weighing at Least 35 kg CIMDUO is a two - drug fixed - dose combination product containing 300 mg of lamivudine ( 3 TC ) and 300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) .
The recommended dosage of CIMDUO in HIV - 1 - infected adult and pediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg is one tablet taken orally once daily with or without food .
2 . 3 Not Recommended in Renal Impairment Because CIMDUO is a fixed - dose combination tablet and cannot be dose adjusted , it is not recommended for patients with impaired renal function ( creatinine clearance less than 50 mL / min ) or patients with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) requiring hemodialysis [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Tablets : 300 mg of lamivudine and 300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( equivalent to 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil ) .
The tablets are white to off - white , film - coated , oval tablets debossed with “ M112 ” on one side and plain on the other side .
Tablets : 300 mg lamivudine and 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( equivalent to 245 mg of tenofovir disoproxil ) .
( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS CIMDUO is contraindicated in patients with a previous hypersensitivity reaction to any of the components contained in the formulation .
• • CIMDUO is contraindicated in patients with previous hypersensitivity to any of the components of this product .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Lactic Acidosis / Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis : Discontinue treatment in patients who develop symptoms or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity .
( 5 . 1 ) • • New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment : Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome .
Assess estimated creatinine clearance before initiating treatment with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , a component of CIMDUO .
In patients at risk for renal dysfunction , assess estimated creatinine clearance , serum phosphorus , urine glucose and urine protein before initiating treatment with tenofovir and periodically during treatment .
Avoid administering CIMDUO with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs .
( 5 . 3 ) • • Hepatic decompensation , some fatal , has occurred in HIV - 1 / HCV co - infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy and interferon - and ribavirin - based regimens .
Monitor for treatment - associated toxicities .
Discontinue CIMDUO , as medically appropriate , and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa , ribavirin , or both .
( 5 . 4 ) • • Pancreatitis : Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis .
Discontinue CIMDUO as clinically appropriate .
( 5 . 5 ) • • Decreases in Bone Mineral Density ( BMD ) : Observed in HIV - infected patients .
Consider assessment of BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss .
( 5 . 6 ) • • Immune Reconstitution Syndrome : Observed in HIV - infected patients .
May necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
( 5 . 7 ) • • Redistribution / Accumulation of Body Fat : Observed in HIV - infected patients receiving antiretroviral combination therapy .
( 5 . 8 ) • • Triple Nucleoside - Only Regimens : Early virologic failure has been reported in HIV - infected patients .
Monitor carefully and consider treatment modification .
( 5 . 9 ) 5 . 1 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis , including fatal cases , have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogs and other antiretrovirals .
Treatment should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity ( which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations ) .
5 . 2 Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients Coinfected with HIV - 1 and HBV Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis All patients with HIV - 1 should be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) before initiating antiretroviral therapy .
Discontinuation of anti - HBV therapy , including 3 TC and TDF , may be associated with severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis .
Patients infected with HBV who discontinue CIMDUO should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow - up for at least several months after stopping treatment .
If appropriate , resumption of anti - hepatitis B therapy may be warranted .
Important Differences Among Lamivudine - Containing Products CIMDUO tablets contain a higher dose of the same active ingredient , 3 TC , than EPIVIR - HBV ® tablets .
EPIVIR - HBV was developed for patients with chronic hepatitis B .
The formulation and dosage of 3 TC in EPIVIR - HBV are not appropriate for patients co - infected with HIV - 1 and HBV .
Safety and efficacy of 3 TC have not been established for treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients co - infected with HIV - 1 and HBV .
If treatment with EPIVIR - HBV , TDF , or a tenofovir alafenamide ( TAF ) - containing product is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV - 1 infection , rapid emergence of HIV - 1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV - 1 treatment .
5 . 3 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment TDF , a component of CIMDUO is principally eliminated by the kidney .
Renal impairment , including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome ( renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia ) , has been reported with the use of TDF [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
It is recommended that estimated creatinine clearance be assessed in all patients prior to initiating therapy and as clinically appropriate during therapy with TDF .
In patients at risk of renal dysfunction , it is recommended that estimated creatinine clearance , serum phosphorus , urine glucose , and urine protein be assessed prior to initiation of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , and periodically during TDF therapy .
Avoid CIMDUO with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent ( e . g . , high - dose or multiple non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV - infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on TDF .
Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy .
Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered , if needed , in patients at risk for renal dysfunction .
Persistent or worsening bone pain , pain in extremities , fractures and / or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in at - risk patients .
5 . 4 Risk of Hepatic Decompensation When Used with Interferon - and Ribavirin - Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as 3 TC , a component of CIMDUO .
Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction ( e . g . , loss of HIV - 1 / HCV virologic suppression ) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with 3 TC in HIV - 1 / HCV co - infected patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , hepatic decompensation ( some fatal ) has occurred in HIV - 1 / HCV co - infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV - 1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin .
Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and 3 TC should be closely monitored for treatment - associated toxicities , especially hepatic decompensation .
Discontinuation of 3 TC should be considered as medically appropriate .
Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa , ribavirin , or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed , including hepatic decompensation ( e . g . , Child - Pugh > 6 ) .
See the full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin .
5 . 5 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure , a history of pancreatitis , or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis , 3 TC , a component of CIMDUO , should be used with caution .
Treatment with CIMDUO should be stopped immediately if clinical signs , symptoms , or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 6 Bone Effects Bone Mineral Density ( BMD ) In clinical trials in HIV - 1 - infected adults , TDF was associated with slightly greater decreases in BMD and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism , suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators .
Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1 , 25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving TDF [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The effects of TDF - associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long - term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown .
Assessment of BMD should be considered for adults who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss .
Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied , such supplementation may be beneficial for all patients .
If bone abnormalities are suspected then appropriate consultation should be obtained .
Mineralization Defects Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy , manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures , have been reported in association with the use of TDF [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Arthralgias and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy .
Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving products containing TDF [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 7 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in HIV - infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy , including 3 TC and TDF .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [ PCP ] , or tuberculosis ) , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
Autoimmune disorders ( such as Graves ’ disease , polymyositis , and Guillain - Barre syndrome ) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution ; however , the time to onset is more variable , and can occur many months after initiation of treatment .
5 . 8 Fat Redistribution In HIV - infected patients , redistribution / accumulation of body fat including central obesity , dorsocervical fat enlargement ( buffalo hump ) , peripheral wasting , facial wasting , breast enlargement , and “ cushingoid appearance ” have been observed in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy .
The mechanism and long - term consequences of these events are currently unknown .
A causal relationship has not been established .
5 . 9 Early Virologic Failure Clinical trials in HIV - infected subjects have demonstrated that certain regimens that only contain three nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTI ) are generally less effective than triple drug regimens containing two NRTIs in combination with either a non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or a HIV - 1 protease inhibitor .
In particular , early virological failure and high rates of resistance substitutions have been reported .
Triple nucleoside regimens should therefore be used with caution .
Patients on a therapy utilizing a triple nucleoside - only regimen should be carefully monitored and considered for treatment modification .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions , the adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Lamivudine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Treatment - Naïve Patients Study 903 - Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions seen in a double - blind comparative controlled study in which 600 treatment - naïve subjects received TDF ( N = 299 ) or stavudine ( d4T ) ( N = 301 ) in combination with 3 TC and EFV for 144 weeks were mild to moderate gastrointestinal events and dizziness .
Mild adverse reactions ( Grade 1 ) were common with a similar incidence in both arms , and included dizziness , diarrhea , and nausea .
Selected moderate to severe adverse reactions are summarized in Table 1 .
Table 1 .
Selected Adverse Reactions [ 1 ] ( Grades 2 - 4 ) Reported in ≥ 5 % in Any Treatment Group in Study 903 ( 0 - 144 Weeks ) TDF + 3 TC + EFV d4T + 3 TC + EFV N = 299 N = 301 Body as a Whole Headache 14 % 17 % Pain 13 % 12 % Fever 8 % 7 % Abdominal pain 7 % 12 % Back pain 9 % 8 % Asthenia 6 % 7 % Digestive System Diarrhea 11 % 13 % Nausea 8 % 9 % Dyspepsia 4 % 5 % Vomiting 5 % 9 % Metabolic Disorders Lipodystrophy [ 2 ] 1 % 8 % Musculoskeletal Arthralgia 5 % 7 % Myalgia 3 % 5 % Nervous System Depression 11 % 10 % Insomnia 5 % 8 % Dizziness 3 % 6 % Peripheral neuropathy [ 3 ] 1 % 5 % Anxiety 6 % 6 % Respiratory Pneumonia 5 % 5 % Skin and Appendages Rash event [ 4 ] 18 % 12 % [ 1 ] Frequencies of adverse reactions are based on all treatment - emergent adverse events , regardless of relationship to study drug .
[ 2 ] Lipodystrophy represents a variety of investigator - described adverse events not a protocol - defined syndrome .
[ 3 ] Peripheral neuropathy includes peripheral neuritis and neuropathy .
[ 4 ] Rash event includes rash , pruritus , maculopapular rash , urticaria , vesiculobullous rash , and pustular rash .
Laboratory Abnormalities With the exception of fasting cholesterol and fasting triglyceride elevations that were more common in the stavudine group ( 40 % and 9 % ) compared with TDF ( 19 % and 1 % ) respectively , laboratory abnormalities observed in this study occurred with similar frequency in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and stavudine treatment arms .
A summary of Grade 3 and 4 laboratory abnormalities is provided in Table 2 .
Table 2 .
Grade 3 / 4 Laboratory Abnormalities Reported in ≥ 1 % of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Treated Subjects in Study 903 ( 0 - 144 Weeks ) TDF + 3 TC + EFV d4T + 3 TC + EFV N = 299 N = 301 Any ≥ Grade 3 Laboratory Abnormality 36 % 42 % Fasting Cholesterol ( > 240 mg / dL ) 19 % 40 % Creatine Kinase ( M : > 990 U / L ; F : > 845 U / L ) 12 % 12 % Serum Amylase ( > 175 U / L ) 9 % 8 % AST ( M : > 180 U / L ; F : > 170 U / L ) 5 % 7 % ALT ( M : > 215 U / L ; F : > 170 U / L ) 4 % 5 % Hematuria ( > 100 RBC / HPF ) 7 % 7 % Neutrophils ( < 750 / mm3 ) 3 % 1 % Fasting Triglycerides ( > 750 mg / dL ) 1 % 9 % Pancreatitis Pancreatitis , which has been fatal in some cases , has been observed in antiretroviral nucleoside - experienced pediatric subjects receiving 3 TC alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Changes in Bone Mineral Density In HIV - 1 - infected adult subjects in Study 903 , there was a significantly greater mean percentage decrease from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine in subjects receiving TDF + 3 TC + EFV ( - 2 . 2 % ± 3 . 9 ) compared with subjects receiving d4T + 3 TC + EFV ( - 1 . 0 % ± 4 . 6 ) through 144 weeks .
Changes in BMD at the hip were similar between the two treatment groups ( - 2 . 8 % ± 3 . 5 in the TDF group vs . - 2 . 4 % ± 4 . 5 in the d4T group ) .
In both groups , the majority of the reduction in BMD occurred in the first 24 - 48 weeks of the trial and this reduction was sustained through Week 144 .
Twenty - eight percent of TDF - treated subjects vs . 21 % of the d4T - treated subjects lost at least 5 % of BMD at the spine or 7 % of BMD at the hip .
Clinically relevant fractures ( excluding fingers and toes ) were reported in 4 subjects in the TDF group and 6 subjects in the d4T group .
In addition , there were significant increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism ( serum bone - specific alkaline phosphatase , serum osteocalcin , serum C telopeptide , and urinary N telopeptide ) and higher serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1 , 25 Vitamin D levels in the TDF group relative to the d4T group ; however , except for bone - specific alkaline phosphatase , these changes resulted in values that remained within the normal range [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use for each of the individual components of CIMDUO ( 3 TC and TDF ) .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish causal relationship to drug exposure .
These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness , frequency of reporting , or potential causal connection to 3 TC and TDF .
Lamivudine Body as a Whole : redistribution / accumulation of body fat [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] .

The following adverse reactions , listed under the body system headings above , may occur as a consequence of proximal renal tubulopathy : rhabdomyolysis , osteomalacia , hypokalemia , muscular weakness , myopathy , hypophosphatemia .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • • Atazanavir : Atazanavir should be coadministered with ritonavir when coadministered with CIMDUO .
( 7 . 2 ) • • HIV - 1 Protease Inhibitors : Monitor for evidence of tenofovir toxicity when CIMDUO is coadministrated with atazanavir / ritonavir , darunavir / ritonavir , or lopinavir / ritonavir .
( 7 . 2 ) • • Sorbitol : Avoid chronic administration of sorbitol with CIMDUO .
( 7 . 5 ) 7 . 1 Drugs Affecting Renal Function Since tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , coadministration of CIMDUO with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of tenofovir and / or increase the concentrations of other renally eliminated drugs .
Some examples include , but are not limited to cidofovir , acyclovir , valacyclovir , ganciclovir , valganciclovir , aminoglycosides ( e . g . , gentamicin ) , and high - dose or multiple NSAIDs [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 HIV - 1 Protease Inhibitors TDF decreases the AUC and Cmin of atazanavir [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
When coadministered with CIMDUO , it is recommended that atazanavir 300 mg is given with ritonavir 100 mg .
TDF should not be coadministered with atazanavir without ritonavir .
Lopinavir / ritonavir , atazanavir coadministered with ritonavir , and darunavir coadministered with ritonavir have been shown to increase tenofovir concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Patients receiving CIMDUO concomitantly with lopinavir / ritonavir , atazanavir and ritonavir , or darunavir and ritonavir should be monitored for tenofovir - associated adverse reactions .
CIMDUO should be discontinued in patients who develop tenofovir - associated adverse reactions .
7 . 3 Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents Coadministration of TDF , a component of CIMDUO , and EPCLUSA ® ( sofosbuvir / velpatasvir ) or HARVONI ® ( ledipasvir / sofosbuvir ) has been shown to increase tenofovir exposure [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In patients receiving TDF concomitantly with sofosbuvir / velpatasvir , monitor for adverse reactions associated with TDF .
In patients receiving CIMDUO concomitantly with ledipasvir / sofosbuvir without an HIV - 1 protease inhibitor / ritonavir or an HIV - 1 protease inhibitor / cobicistat combination , monitor for adverse reactions associated with tenofovir .
In patients receiving CIMDUO concomitantly with ledipasvir / sofosbuvir and an HIV - 1 protease inhibitor / ritonavir or an HIV - 1 protease inhibitor / cobicistat combination , consider an alternative HCV or antiretroviral therapy , as the safety of increased tenofovir concentrations in this setting has not been established .
If coadministration is necessary , monitor for adverse reactions associated with tenofovir .
7 . 4 Drugs Inhibiting Organic Cation Transporters 3 TC , a component of CIMDUO , is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion .
The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered , particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system ( e . g . , trimethoprim ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of 3 TC .
7 . 5 Sorbitol Coadministration of single doses of 3 TC and sorbitol resulted in a sorbitol dose - dependent reduction in 3 TC exposures .
When possible , avoid use of sorbitol - containing medicines with 3 TC [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended due to potential for HIV transmission .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to CIMDUO during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry ( APR ) at 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
Risk Summary Available data from the APR show no difference in the risk of overall major birth defects for 3 TC compared to the background rate for major birth defects of 2 . 7 % in the U . S . reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program ( MACDP ) ( see Data ) .
3 TC produced embryonic toxicity in rabbits at a dose that produced similar human exposures as the recommended clinical dose .
The relevance of animal findings to human pregnancy registry data is not known .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies with TDF in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , TDF should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Human Data Lamivudine Based on prospective reports from the APR of over 11 , 000 exposures to 3 TC during pregnancy resulting in live births ( including over 4 , 300 exposed in the first trimester ) , there was no difference between 3 TC and overall birth defects compared with the background birth defect rate of 2 . 7 % in the U . S . reference population of the MACDP .
The prevalence of defects in the first trimester was 3 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 2 . 6 % to 3 . 7 % ) .
3 TC pharmacokinetics were studied in pregnant women during 2 clinical trials conducted in South Africa .
The trials assessed pharmacokinetics in 16 women at 36 weeks gestation using 150 mg 3 TC twice daily with zidovudine , 10 women at 38 weeks gestation using 150 mg 3 TC twice daily with zidovudine , and 10 women at 38 weeks gestation using 3 TC 300 mg twice daily without other antiretrovirals .
These trials were not designed or powered to provide efficacy information .
3 TC pharmacokinetics in pregnant women were similar to those seen in non - pregnant adults and in postpartum women .
3 TC concentrations were generally similar in maternal , neonatal , and umbilical cord serum samples .
In a subset of subjects , amniotic fluid specimens were collected following natural rupture of membranes and confirmed that lamivudine crosses the placenta in humans .
Amniotic fluid concentrations of lamivudine were typically 2 times greater than maternal serum levels and ranged from 1 . 2 to 2 . 5 mcg per mL ( 150 mg twice daily ) and 2 . 1 to 5 . 2 mcg per mL ( 300 mg twice daily ) .
Animal Data Lamivudine Studies in pregnant rats showed that 3 TC is transferred to the fetus through the placenta .
Reproduction studies with orally administered 3 TC have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses producing plasma levels up to approximately 35 times that for the recommended adult HIV dose .
No evidence of teratogenicity due to 3 TC was observed .
Evidence of embryo - lethality was seen in the rabbit at exposure levels similar to those observed in humans but there was no indication of this effect in the rat at exposure levels up to 35 times those in humans .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 14 and 19 times the human dose based on body surface area comparisons and revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to tenofovir .
8 . 2 Lactation The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV - 1 - infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV - 1 infection .
Lamivudine 3 TC is excreted into human milk .
Samples of breast milk obtained from 20 mothers receiving 3 TC monotherapy , 300 mg twice daily ( 2 times the dose in CIMDUO ) , had measurable concentrations of 3 TC .
There is no information on the effects of 3 TC on the breastfed infant , or the effects of 3 TC on milk production .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Samples of breast milk obtained from five HIV - 1 - infected mothers in the first postpartum week show that tenofovir is excreted in human milk at low levels .
The impact of this exposure in breastfed infants is unknown and the effects of TDF on milk production is unknown .
Because of the potential for 1 ) HIV transmission ( in HIV - negative infants ) ; 2 ) developing viral resistance ( in HIV - positive infants ) ; and 3 ) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant similar to those seen in adults , instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving CIMDUO .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of CIMDUO as a fixed - dose tablet in pediatric patients infected with HIV - 1 and weighing at least 35 kg have been established based on clinical studies using the individual components ( lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ) .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of CIMDUO did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , caution should be exercised in the administration of CIMDUO in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment CIMDUO is not recommended for patients with impaired renal function ( i . e . , creatinine clearance less than 50 mL / min ) or patients with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) requiring hemodialysis because it is a fixed - dose combination formulation that cannot be adjusted [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE If overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity , and standard supportive treatment applied as necessary .
Lamivudine : There is no known specific treatment for overdose with 3 TC .
If overdose occurs , the patient should be monitored and standard supportive treatment applied as required because a negligible amount of 3 TC was removed via ( 4 - hour ) hemodialysis , continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis , and automated peritoneal dialysis , it is not known if continuous hemodialysis would provide clinical benefit in a 3 TC overdose event .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate : Limited clinical experience at doses higher than the therapeutic dose of TDF 300 mg is available .
Tenofovir is efficiently removed by hemodialysis with an extraction coefficient of approximately 54 % .
Following a single 300 - mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , a 4 - hour hemodialysis session removed approximately 10 % of the administered tenofovir dose .
11 DESCRIPTION CIMDUO tablets contain lamivudine ( also known as 3 TC ) , a synthetic nucleoside analogue with activity against HIV - 1 and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or tenofovir DF , a fumaric acid salt of bis - isopropoxycarbonyloxymethyl ester prodrug of tenofovir .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action CIMDUO is a fixed - dose combination of antiviral drugs 3 TC and TDF with antiviral activity against HIV - 1 [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Lamivudine After oral administration of 2 mg / kg of 3 TC twice a day to 9 adults with HIV - 1 , the peak serum 3 TC concentration ( Cmax ) was 1 . 5 ± 0 . 5 mcg / mL ( mean ± SD ) .
The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve ( AUC ) and Cmax increased in proportion to oral dose over the range from 0 . 25 to 10 mg / kg and absolute bioavailability in 12 adult patients was 86 % ± 16 % ( mean ± SD ) for the 150 - mg tablet and 87 % ± 13 % for the oral solution .
Binding of 3 TC to human plasma proteins is low ( < 36 % ) .
Within 12 hours after a single oral dose of 3 TC in 6 HIV - 1 - infected adults , 5 . 2 % ± 1 . 4 % ( mean ± SD ) of the dose was excreted as the trans - sulfoxide metabolite in the urine .
The majority of 3 TC is eliminated unchanged in urine by active organic cationic secretion and the observed mean elimination half - life ( t1 / 2 ) ranged from 5 to 7 hours in most single - dose studies with serum sampling for 24 hours after dosing .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Following oral administration of a single 300 - mg dose of TDF to HIV - 1 - infected subjects in the fasted state , maximum serum concentrations ( Cmax ) were achieved in 1 . 0 ± 0 . 4 hrs ( mean ± SD ) and Cmax and AUC values were 296 ± 90 ng / mL and 2287 ± 685 ng • hr / mL , respectively .
The oral bioavailability of tenofovir from TDF in fasted subjects is approximately 25 % .
Less than 0 . 7 % of tenofovir binds to human plasma proteins in vitro and the binding is independent of concentration over the range of 0 . 01 to 25 mcg / mL .
Approximately 70 to 80 % of the intravenous dose of tenofovir is recovered as unchanged drug in the urine .
Tenofovir is eliminated by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion with a renal clearance in adults with normal renal function of 243 ± 33 mL / min ( mean ± SD ) .
Following a single oral dose , the terminal elimination half - life of tenofovir is approximately 17 hours .
Special Populations Race Lamivudine There are no significant or clinically relevant racial differences in lamivudine pharmacokinetics .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate There were insufficient numbers from racial and ethnic groups other than Caucasian to adequately determine potential pharmacokinetic differences among these populations .
Gender There are no significant or clinically relevant gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine and tenofovir .
Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of lamivudine and tenofovir have not been studied in patients over 65 years of age .
Patients with Renal Impairment [ See Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) . ]

Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established in the presence of decompensated liver disease .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir following a 300 mg single dose of TDF have been studied in non - HIV - infected subjects with moderate to severe ( Child - Pugh B to C ) hepatic impairment .
There were no substantial alterations in tenofovir pharmacokinetics in subjects with hepatic impairment compared with unimpaired subjects .
Assessment of Drug Interactions [ See Drug Interactions ( 7 ) . ]
Lamivudine Effect of 3 TC on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Agents Based on in vitro study results , 3 TC at therapeutic drug exposures is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates of the following transporters : organic anion transporter polypeptide 1B1 / 3 ( OATP1B1 / 3 ) , breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) , P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) , multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 ( MATE1 ) , MATE2 - K , organic cation transporter 1 ( OCT1 ) , OCT2 , or OCT3 .
Effect of Other Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of 3 TC 3 TC is a substrate of MATE1 , MATE2 - K , and OCT2 in vitro .
Trimethoprim ( an inhibitor of these drug transporters ) has been shown to increase 3 TC plasma concentrations .
This interaction is not considered clinically significant as no dose adjustment of 3 TC is needed .
3 TC is a substrate of P - gp and BCRP ; however , considering its absolute bioavailability ( 87 % ) , it is unlikely that these transporters play a significant role in the absorption of 3 TC .
Therefore , coadministration of drugs that are inhibitors of these efflux transporters is unlikely to affect the disposition and elimination of 3 TC .
Interferon Alfa There was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between 3 TC and interferon alfa in a trial of 19 healthy male subjects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Ribavirin In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of 3 TC , stavudine , and zidovudine .
However , no pharmacokinetic ( e . g . , plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations ) or pharmacodynamic ( e . g . , loss of HIV - 1 / HCV virologic suppression ) interaction was observed when ribavirin and 3 TC ( n = 18 ) , stavudine ( n = 10 ) , or zidovudine ( n = 6 ) were coadministered as part of a multi - drug regimen to HIV - 1 / HCV co - infected subjects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Sorbitol ( Excipient ) 3 TC and sorbitol solutions were coadministered to 16 healthy adult subjects in an open - label , randomized sequence , 4 - period , crossover trial .
Each subject received a single 300 - mg dose of 3 TC oral solution alone or coadministered with a single dose of 3 . 2 grams , 10 . 2 grams , or 13 . 4 grams of sorbitol in solution .
Coadministration of 3 TC with sorbitol resulted in dose - dependent decreases of 20 % , 39 % , and 44 % in the AUC ( 0 - 24 ) , 14 % , 32 % , and 36 % in the AUC ( ∞ ) , and 28 % , 52 % , and 55 % in the Cmax of lamivudine .
Trimethoprim / Sulfamethoxazole 3 TC and TMP / SMX were coadministered to 14 HIV - 1 - positive subjects in a single - center , open - label , randomized , crossover trial .
Each subject received treatment with a single 300 - mg dose of 3 TC and TMP 160 mg / SMX 800 mg once a day for 5 days with concomitant administration of 3 TC 300 mg with the fifth dose in a crossover design .
Coadministration of TMP / SMX with 3 TC resulted in an increase of 43 % ± 23 % ( mean ± SD ) in 3 TC AUC ∞ , a decrease of 29 % ± 13 % in 3 TC oral clearance , and a decrease of 30 % ± 36 % in 3 TC renal clearance .
The pharmacokinetic properties of TMP and SMX were not altered by coadministration with 3 TC .
There is no information regarding the effect on 3 TC pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP / SMX such as those used in treating PCP .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate At concentrations substantially higher ( ~ 300 - fold ) than those observed in vivo , tenofovir did not inhibit in vitro CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 , CYP2C9 , or CYP2E1 .
However , a small ( 6 % ) but statistically significant reduction in metabolism of CYP1A substrate was observed .
Based on the results of in vitro experiments and the known elimination pathway of tenofovir , the potential for CYP mediated interactions involving TDF with other medicinal products is low .
TDF has been evaluated in healthy volunteers in combination with other antiretroviral and potential concomitant drugs .
Tables 5 and 6 summarize pharmacokinetic effects of coadministered drug on tenofovir pharmacokinetics and effects of TDF on the pharmacokinetics of coadministered drug .
Coadministration of TDF with didanosine results in changes in the pharmacokinetics of didanosine that may be of clinical significance .
Concomitant dosing of TDF with didanosine significantly increases the Cmax and AUC of didanosine .
When didanosine 250 mg enteric - coated capsules were administered with TDF , systemic exposures of didanosine were similar to those seen with the 400 mg enteric - coated capsules alone under fasted conditions ( Table 5 ) .
The mechanism of this interaction is unknown .
No clinically significant drug interactions have been observed between TDF and efavirenz , methadone , nelfinavir , oral contraceptives , ribavirin , or sofosbuvir .

12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Lamivudine 3 TC is a synthetic nucleoside analogue with activity against HIV - 1 and HBV .
Intracellularly , 3 TC is phosphorylated to its active 5 ’ ‑ triphosphate metabolite , lamivudine triphosphate ( 3 TC - TP ) .
The principal mode of action of 3 TC ‑ TP is inhibition of HIV - 1 reverse transcriptase ( RT ) via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleotide analogue .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate TDF is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate diester analog of adenosine monophosphate .
TDF requires initial diester hydrolysis for conversion to tenofovir and subsequent phosphorylations by cellular enzymes to form tenofovir diphosphate .
Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV - 1 reverse transcriptase and HBV reverse transcriptase by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5 ’ - triphosphate and , after incorporation into DNA , by DNA chain termination .
Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases α , β , and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ .
Antiviral Activity Lamivudine The antiviral activity of 3 TC against HIV - 1 was assessed in a number of cell lines ( including monocytes and fresh human peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBMCs ) using standard susceptibility assays .
EC50 values were in the range of 3 to 15 , 000 nM .
( 1 μM = 0 . 23 mcg / mL ) .
The median EC50 values of 3 TC were 60 nM ( range : 20 to 70 nM ) , 35 nM ( range : 30 to 40 nM ) , 30 nM ( range : 20 to 90 nM ) , 20 nM ( range : 3 to 40 nM ) , 30 nM ( range : 1 to 60 nM ) , 30 nM ( range : 20 to 70 nM ) , 30 nM ( range : 3 to 70 nM ) , and 30 nM ( range : 20 to 90 nM ) against HIV - 1 clades A - G and group O viruses ( n = 3 except n = 2 for clade B ) , respectively .
The EC50 values against HIV - 2 isolates ( n = 4 ) ranged from 3 to 120 nM in PBMCs .
3 TC was not antagonistic to all tested anti - HIV agents .
Ribavirin ( 50 μM ) used in the treatment of chronic HCV infection decreased the anti - HIV - 1 activity of 3 TC by 3 . 5 - fold in MT - 4 cells .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate The antiviral activity of tenofovir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV - 1 was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines , primary monocyte / macrophage cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes .
The EC50 ( 50 % effective concentration ) values for tenofovir were in the range of 0 . 04 μM to 8 . 5 μM .
Tenofovir displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV - 1 clades A , B , C , D , E , F , G , and O ( EC50 values ranged from 0 . 5 μM to 2 . 2 μM ) and strain - specific activity against HIV - 2 ( EC50 values ranged from 1 . 6 μM to 5 . 5 μM ) .
Please see the full prescribing information for VIREAD for information regarding the inhibitory activity of TDF against HBV .
Resistance Lamivudine 3 TC - resistant variants of HIV ‑ 1 have been selected in cell culture .
Genotypic analysis showed that resistance was predominantly due to a methionine to valine or isoleucine ( M184V / I ) substitution in reverse transcriptase .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate HIV - 1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir have been selected in cell culture .
These viruses expressed a K65R substitution in reverse transcriptase and showed a 2 - to 4 - fold reduction in susceptibility to tenofovir .
In addition , a K70E substitution in HIV - 1 reverse transcriptase has been selected by tenofovir and results in low - level reduced susceptibility to tenofovir .
K65R substitutions developed in some subjects failing a tenofovir disoproxil fumarate regimen .
Cross - Resistance Lamivudine Cross - resistance among NRTIs has been observed .
3 TC - resistant HIV - 1 isolates were cross - resistant in cell culture to didanosine ( ddI ) .
Cross - resistance is also expected with abacavir and emtricitabine as these select M184V substitutions .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Cross - resistance among NRTIs has been observed .
The K65R and K70E substitutions selected by tenofovir are also selected in some HIV - 1 - infected subjects treated with abacavir or didanosine .
HIV - 1 isolates with the K65R substitution also showed reduced susceptibility to FTC and 3 TC .
HIV - 1 isolates from subjects ( N = 20 ) whose HIV - 1 expressed a mean of 3 zidovudine - associated RT amino acid substitutions ( M41L , D67N , K70R , L210W , T215Y / F , or K219Q / E / N ) showed a 3 . 1 - fold decrease in the susceptibility to tenofovir .
Subjects whose virus expressed an L74V substitution without zidovudine resistance - associated substitutions ( N = 8 ) had reduced response to VIREAD .
Limited data are available for patients whose virus expressed a Y115F substitution ( N = 3 ) , Q151M substitution ( N = 2 ) , or T69 insertion ( N = 4 ) , all of whom had a reduced response .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Lamivudine Long - term carcinogenicity studies with 3 TC in mice and rats showed no evidence of carcinogenic potential at exposures up to 10 times ( mice ) and 58 times ( rats ) the human exposures at the recommended dose of 300 mg .
3 TC was not mutagenic in a microbial mutagenicity assay , in an in vitro cell transformation assay , in a rat micronucleus test , in a rat bone marrow cytogenetic assay , and in assay for unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat liver .
3 TC showed no evidence of in vivo genotoxic activity in the rat at oral doses of up to 2000 mg per kg , producing plasma levels of 35 to 45 times those in humans at the recommended dose for HIV ‑ 1 infection .
In a study of reproductive performance , 3 TC administered to rats at doses up to 4 , 000 mg per kg per day , producing plasma levels 47 to 70 times those in humans , revealed no evidence of impaired fertility and no effect on the survival , growth , and development to weaning of the offspring .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Long - term oral carcinogenicity studies of TDF in mice and rats were carried out at exposures up to approximately 16 times ( mice ) and 5 times ( rats ) those observed in humans at the therapeutic dose for HIV - 1 infection .
At the high dose in female mice , liver adenomas were increased at exposures 16 times that in humans .
In rats , the study was negative for carcinogenic findings at exposures up to 5 times that observed in humans at the therapeutic dose .
TDF was mutagenic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and negative in an in vitro bacterial mutagenicity test ( Ames test ) .
In an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay , TDF was negative when administered to male mice .
There were no effects on fertility , mating performance or early embryonic development when TDF was administered to male rats at a dose equivalent to 10 times the human dose based on body surface area comparisons for 28 days prior to mating and to female rats for 15 days prior to mating through day seven of gestation .
There was , however , an alteration of the estrous cycle in female rats .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Tenofovir and TDF administered in toxicology studies to rats , dogs , and monkeys at exposures ( based on AUCs ) greater than or equal to 6 - fold those observed in humans caused bone toxicity .
In monkeys the bone toxicity was diagnosed as osteomalacia .
Osteomalacia observed in monkeys appeared to be reversible upon dose reduction or discontinuation of tenofovir .
In rats and dogs , the bone toxicity manifested as reduced bone mineral density .
The mechanism ( s ) underlying bone toxicity is unknown .
Evidence of renal toxicity was noted in 4 animal species .
Increases in serum creatinine , BUN , glycosuria , proteinuria , phosphaturia , and / or calciuria and decreases in serum phosphate were observed to varying degrees in these animals .
These toxicities were noted at exposures ( based on AUCs ) 2 to 20 times higher than those observed in humans .
The relationship of the renal abnormalities , particularly the phosphaturia , to the bone toxicity is not known .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Clinical Efficacy in Patients with HIV - 1 Infection Treatment - Naïve Adult Patients Trial 903 Data through 144 weeks are reported for Trial 903 , a double - blind , active - controlled multicenter trial comparing EFV 600 mg + 3 TC 300 mg + TDF 300 mg vs . EFV 600 mg + 3 TC 300 mg + stavudine ( d4T ) 40 mg in 600 antiretroviral - naïve subjects .
Subjects had a mean age of 36 years ( range 18 - 64 ) ; 74 % were male , 64 % were Caucasian , and 20 % were Black .
The mean baseline CD4 + cell count was 279 cells / mm3 ( range 3 - 956 ) and median baseline plasma HIV - 1 RNA was 77 , 600 copies / mL ( range 417 - 5 , 130 , 000 ) .
Subjects were stratified by baseline HIV - 1 RNA and CD4 + cell count .
Forty - three percent of subjects had baseline viral loads > 100 , 000 copies / mL and 39 % had CD4 + cell counts < 200 cells / mm3 .
Treatment outcomes through 48 and 144 weeks are presented in Table 7 .

Outcomes of Randomized Treatment at Week 48 and 144 ( Study 903 ) Outcomes At Week 48 At Week 144 EFV + 3 TC + TDF ( N = 299 ) EFV + 3 TC + d4T ( N = 301 ) EFV + 3 TC + TDF ( N = 299 ) EFV + 3 TC + d4T ( N = 301 ) Responder [ 1 ] 79 % 82 % 68 % 62 % Virologic failure [ 2 ] 6 % 4 % 10 % 8 % Rebound 5 % 3 % 8 % 7 % Never suppressed 0 % 1 % 0 % 0 % Added an antiretroviral agent 1 % 1 % 2 % 1 % Death < 1 % 1 % < 1 % 2 % Discontinued due to adverse event 6 % 6 % 8 % 13 % Discontinued for other reasons [ 3 ] 8 % 7 % 14 % 15 % [ 1 ] Subjects achieved and maintained confirmed HIV - 1 RNA < 400 copies / mL through Week 48 and 144 .
[ 2 ] Includes confirmed viral rebound and failure to achieve confirmed < 400 copies / mL through Week 48 and 144 .
[ 3 ] Includes lost to follow - up , subject ’ s withdrawal , noncompliance , protocol violation and other reasons .
Achievement of plasma HIV - 1 RNA concentrations of less than 400 copies / mL at Week 144 was similar between the two treatment groups for the population stratified at baseline on the basis of HIV - 1 RNA concentration ( > or ≤ 100 , 000 copies / mL ) and CD4 + cell count ( < or ≥ 200 cells / mm3 ) .
Through 144 weeks of therapy , 62 % and 58 % of subjects in the TDF and stavudine arms , respectively , achieved and maintained confirmed HIV - 1 RNA < 50 copies / mL .
The mean increase from baseline in CD4 + cell count was 263 cells / mm3 for the TDF arm and 283 cells / mm3 for the stavudine arm .
Through 144 weeks , 11 subjects in the TDF group and 9 subjects in the stavudine group experienced a new CDC Class C event .
