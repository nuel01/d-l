( 2 . 2 ) [ 1 ] See Dosage Modification Guidelines for patients with neutropenia or reduced platelets .
( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 ) See Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment .
( 2 . 3 ) [ 1 ] 2 . 1 Small Cell Lung Cancer Recommended Dosage : • The recommended dose of topotecan hydrochloride for injection is 1 . 5 mg / m2 by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily for 5 consecutive days , starting on day 1 of a 21 - day course .
• In the absence of tumor progression , a minimum of 4 courses is recommended because tumor response may be delayed and median time to response in 4 small cell lung cancer trials was 5 to 7 weeks .
Dosage Modification Guidelines : • In the event of severe neutropenia ( defined as < 500 cells / mm3 ) during any course , reduce the dose by 0 . 25 mg / m2 ( to 1 . 25 mg / m2 ) for subsequent courses .
• Alternatively , in the event of severe neutropenia , administer G - CSF ( granulocyte - colony stimulating factor ) following the subsequent course ( before resorting to dose reduction ) starting from day 6 of the course ( 24 hours after completion of topotecan administration ) .
In the event the platelet count falls below 25 , 000 cells / mm3 , reduce doses by 0 . 25 mg / m2 ( to 1 . 25 mg / m2 ) for subsequent courses .
2 . 2 Cervical Cancer Recommended Dosage : The recommended dose of topotecan hydrochloride for injection is 0 . 75 mg / m2 by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes daily on days 1 , 2 , and 3 ; followed by cisplatin 50 mg / m2 by intravenous infusion on day 1 repeated every 21 days ( a 21 - day course ) .
Dosage Modification Guidelines : Dosage adjustments for subsequent courses of topotecan hydrochloride for injection in combination with cisplatin are specific for each drug .

a Includes patients who were eligible and treated .
b Grades 1 through 4 only .
There were 3 patients who experienced Grade 5 deaths with investigator designated attribution .
One was a Grade 5 hemorrhage in which the drug - related thrombocytopenia aggravated the event .
A second patient experienced bowel obstruction , cardiac arrest , pleural effusion and respiratory failure which were not treatment related but probably aggravated by treatment .
A third patient experienced a pulmonary embolism and adult respiratory distress syndrome , the latter was indirectly treatment - related .
c Constitutional includes fatigue ( lethargy , malaise , asthenia ) , fever ( in the absence of neutropenia ) , rigors , chills , sweating , and weight gain or loss .
d Pain includes abdominal pain or cramping , arthralgia , bone pain , chest pain ( non - cardiac and non pleuritic ) , dysmenorrhea , dyspareunia , earache , headache , hepatic pain , myalgia , neuropathic pain , pain due to radiation , pelvic pain , pleuritic pain , rectal or perirectal pain , and tumor pain .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials or listed in other sections of the prescribing information , the following reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of topotecan hydrochloride for injection .
Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , estimates of frequency cannot be made .
These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness , frequency of reporting , or potential causal connection to topotecan hydrochloride for injection .
Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : Severe bleeding ( in association with thrombocytopenia ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Immune System Disorders : Allergic manifestations ; anaphylactoid reactions .
Gastrointestinal Disorders : Abdominal pain potentially associated with neutropenic colitis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Pulmonary Disorders : Interstitial lung disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Angioedema , severe dermatitis , severe pruritus .
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : Inadvertent extravasation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS G - CSF : Concomitant administration of G - CSF can prolong the duration of neutropenia , so if G - CSF is to be used , do not initiate it until day 6 of the course of therapy , 24 hours after completion of treatment with topotecan hydrochloride for injection .
Platinum and Other Cytotoxic Agents : Myelosuppression was more severe when topotecan hydrochloride for injection , at a dose of 1 . 25 mg / m2 / day for 5 days , was given in combination with cisplatin at a dose of 50 mg / m2 in Phase 1 trials .
In one trial , 1 of 3 patients had severe neutropenia for 12 days and a second patient died with neutropenic sepsis .
Greater myelosuppression is also likely to be seen when topotecan hydrochloride for injection is used in combination with other cytotoxic agents , thereby necessitating a dose reduction .
However , when combining topotecan hydrochloride for injection with platinum agents ( e . g . , cisplatin or carboplatin ) , a distinct sequence - dependent interaction on myelosuppression has been reported .
Coadministration of a platinum agent on day 1 of dosing with topotecan hydrochloride for injection required lower doses of each agent compared to coadministration on day 5 of the dosing schedule for topotecan hydrochloride for injection .
For information on the pharmacokinetics , efficacy , safety , and dosing of topotecan hydrochloride for injection at a dose of 0 . 75 mg / m2 / day on days 1 , 2 , and 3 in combination with cisplatin 50 mg / m2 on day 1 for cervical cancer , see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) .
• Do not initiate G - CSF until 24 hours after completion of treatment with topotecan hydrochloride for injection .
Concomitant administration can prolong duration of neutropenia .
( 7 ) • Greater myelosuppression is likely to be seen when used in combination with other cytotoxic agents .
( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Nursing Mothers : Discontinue nursing when receiving topotecan hydrochloride for injection .
( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Topotecan hydrochloride for injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
In rabbits , a dose of 0 . 10 mg / kg / day ( about equal to the clinical dose on a mg / m2 basis ) given on days 6 through 20 of gestation caused maternal toxicity , embryolethality , and reduced fetal body weight .
In the rat , a dose of 0 . 23 mg / kg / day ( about equal to the clinical dose on a mg / m2 basis ) given for 14 days before mating through gestation day 6 caused fetal resorption , microphthalmia , pre - implant loss , and mild maternal toxicity .
A dose of 0 . 10 mg / kg / day ( about half the clinical dose on a mg / m2 basis ) given to rats on days 6 through 17 of gestation caused an increase in post - implantation mortality .
This dose also caused an increase in total fetal malformations .
The most frequent malformations were of the eye ( microphthalmia , anophthalmia , rosette formation of the retina , coloboma of the retina , ectopic orbit ) , brain ( dilated lateral and third ventricles ) , skull , and vertebrae .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of topotecan hydrochloride for injection in pregnant women .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving topotecan hydrochloride for injection , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus .
[ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Rats excrete high concentrations of topotecan into milk .
Lactating female rats given 4 . 72 mg / m2 IV ( about twice the clinical dose on a mg / m2 basis ) excreted topotecan into milk at concentrations up to 48 - fold higher than those in plasma .
It is not known whether the drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from topotecan hydrochloride for injection , discontinue breastfeeding when women are receiving topotecan hydrochloride for injection .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 879 patients with small cell lung cancer in clinical trials of topotecan hydrochloride for injection , 32 % ( n = 281 ) were 65 years of age and older , while 3 . 8 % ( n = 33 ) were 75 years of age and older .
Of the 140 patients with stage IV - B , relapsed , or refractory cervical cancer in clinical studies of topotecan hydrochloride for injection who received topotecan hydrochloride for injection plus cisplatin in the randomized clinical trial , 6 % ( n = 9 ) were 65 years of age and older , while 3 % ( n = 4 ) were 75 years of age and older .
No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger adult patients , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger adult patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
There were no apparent differences in the pharmacokinetics of topotecan in elderly patients , once the age - related decrease in renal function was considered [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment of topotecan hydrochloride for injection appears to be required for patients with mild renal impairment ( Clcr 40 to 60 mL / min . )
.
Dosage reduction is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment ( Clcr 20 to 39 mL / min . )
.
Insufficient data are available in patients with severe renal impairment to provide a dosage recommendation for topotecan hydrochloride for injection .
[ See Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdoses ( up to 10 - fold of the prescribed dose ) occurred in patients treated with intravenous topotecan .
The primary complication of overdosage is bone marrow suppression .
The observed signs and symptoms of overdose are consistent with the known adverse reactionsassociated with topotecan hydrochloride for injection for intravenous use [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 , 6 . 2 ) ] .
In addition , elevated hepatic enzymes and mucositis have been reported following overdose .
One patient received a single dose of 40 mg / m2 of intravenous topotecan and developed gastrointestinal toxicity , skin toxicity , and myelosuppresion leading to septic shock .
Another patient received a single dose of 35 mg / m2 and experienced severe , reversible neutropenia .
There is no known antidote for overdosage with topotecan hydrochloride for injection .
If an overdose is suspected , monitor the patient for bone marrow suppression and institute supportive - care measures ( such as prophylactic G - CSF and antibiotic therapy ) as appropriate .
11 DESCRIPTION Topotecan hydrochloride for injection is a semi - synthetic derivative of camptothecin and is an anti - tumor drug with topoisomerase I - inhibitory activity .
Topotecan hydrochloride for Injection is supplied as a sterile lyophilized , buffered , light yellow to greenish powder available in single - dose vials .
Each vial contains topotecan hydrochloride equivalent to 4 mg of topotecan as free base .
The reconstituted solution ranges in color from yellow to yellow - green and is intended for administration by intravenous infusion .
Inactive ingredients are mannitol 48 mg and tartaric acid 20 mg .
Hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide may be used to adjust the pH . The solution pH ranges from 2 . 5 to 3 . 5 .
The chemical name for topotecan hydrochloride is ( S ) - 10 - [ ( dimethylamino ) methyl ] - 4 ethyl - 4 , 9 - dihydroxy - 1 H - pyrano [ 3 ’ , 4 ’ : 6 , 7 ] indolizino [ 1 , 2 - b ] quinoline - 3 , 14 - ( 4 H , 12 H ) - dione monohydrochloride .
It has the molecular formula C23H23N3O5 • HCl and a molecular weight of 457 . 9 .
Topotecan hydrochloride has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] It is soluble in water and melts with decomposition at 213 ° to 218 ° C . 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single - strand breaks .
Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I - DNA complex and prevents religation of these single - strand breaks .
The cytotoxicity of topotecan is thought to be due to double - strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis , when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topotecan , topoisomerase I , and DNA .
Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double - strand breaks .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The dose - limiting toxicity of topotecan is leukopenia .
White blood cell count decreases with increasing topotecan dose or topotecan AUC .
When topotecan is administered at a dose of 1 . 5 mg / m2 / day for 5 days , an 80 % to 90 % decrease in white blood cell count at nadir is typically observed after the first cycle of therapy .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of topotecan have been evaluated in cancer patients following doses of 0 . 5 to 1 . 5 mg / m2 administered as a 30 - minute infusion .
Topotecan exhibits multiexponential pharmacokinetics with a terminal half - life of 2 to 3 hours .
Total exposure ( AUC ) is approximately dose - proportional .
Distribution : Binding of topotecan to plasma proteins is about 35 % .
Metabolism : Topotecan undergoes a reversible pH - dependent hydrolysis of its lactone moiety ; it is the lactone form that is pharmacologically active .
At pH ≤ 4 , the lactone is exclusively present , whereas the ring - opened hydroxy - acid form predominates at physiologic pH . In vitro studies in human liver microsomes indicate topotecan is metabolized to an N - demethylated metabolite .
The mean metabolite : parent AUC ratio was about 3 % for total topotecan and topotecan lactone following IV administration .
Excretion : Renal clearance is an important determinant of topotecan elimination .
In a mass balance / excretion trial in 4 patients with solid tumors , the overall recovery of total topotecan and its N - desmethyl metabolite in urine and feces over 9 days averaged 73 . 4 % ± 2 . 3 % of the administered IV dose .
Mean values of 50 . 8 % ± 2 . 9 % as total topotecan and 3 . 1 % ± 1 . 0 % as N - desmethyl topotecan were excreted in the urine following IV administration .
Fecal elimination of total topotecan accounted for 17 . 9 % ± 3 . 6 % while fecal elimination of N desmethyl topotecan was 1 . 7 % ± 0 . 6 % .
An O - glucuronidation metabolite of topotecan and N desmethyl topotecan has been identified in the urine .
These metabolites , topotecan - O glucuronide and N - desmethyl topotecan - O - glucuronide , were less than 2 % of the administered dose .
Effect of Gender : The overall mean topotecan plasma clearance in male patients was approximately 24 % higher than that in female patients , largely reflecting difference in body size .
Effect of Age : Topotecan pharmacokinetics have not been specifically studied in an elderly population , but population pharmacokinetic analysis in female patients did not identify age as a significant factor .
Decreased renal clearance , which is common in the elderly , is a more important determinant of topotecan clearance [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Effect of Race : The effect of race on topotecan pharmacokinetics has not been studied .
Effect of Renal Impairment : In patients with mild renal impairment ( creatinine clearance of 40 to 60 mL / min . )
, topotecan plasma clearance was decreased to about 67 % of the value in patients with normal renal function .
In patients with moderate renal impairment ( Clcr of 20 to 39 mL / min . )
, topotecan plasma clearance was reduced to about 34 % of the value in control patients , with an increase in half - life .
Mean half - life , estimated in 3 patients with renal impairment , was about 5 . 0 hours .
Dosage adjustment is recommended for these patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Effect of Hepatic Impairment : Plasma clearance in patients with hepatic impairment ( serum bilirubin levels between 1 . 7 and 15 . 0 mg / dL ) was decreased to about 67 % of the value in patients without hepatic impairment .
Topotecan half - life increased slightly , from 2 . 0 hours to 2 . 5 hours , but these patients with hepatic impairment tolerated the usual recommended topotecan dosage regimen .
Drug Interactions : Pharmacokinetic trials of the interaction of topotecan with concomitantly administered medications have not been formally investigated . In vitro inhibition studies using marker substrates known to be metabolized by human P450 CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2C8 / 9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E , CYP3A , or CYP4A or dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase indicate that the activities of these enzymes were not altered by topotecan .
Enzyme inhibition by topotecan has not been evaluated in vivo .
No pharmacokinetic data are available following topotecan ( 0 . 75 mg / m2 / day for 3 consecutive days ) and cisplatin ( 50 mg / m2 / day on day 1 ) in patients with cervical cancer .
Myelosuppression was more severe when topotecan hydrochloride for injection was given in combination with cisplatin .
[ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenicity testing of topotecan has not been performed .
Topotecan is known to be genotoxic to mammalian cells and is a probable carcinogen .
Topotecan was mutagenic to L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells and clastogenic to cultured human lymphocytes with and without metabolic activation .
It was also clastogenic to mouse bone marrow .
Topotecan did not cause mutations in bacterial cells .
Topotecan given to female rats prior to mating at a dose of 1 . 4 mg / m2 IV ( about equal to the clinical dose on a mg / m2 basis ) caused superovulation possibly related to inhibition of follicular atresia .
This dose given to pregnant female rats also caused increased pre - implantation loss .
Studies in dogs given 0 . 4 mg / m2 IV ( about 1 / 4 th the clinical dose on a mg / m2 basis ) of topotecan daily for a month suggest that treatment may cause an increase in the incidence of multinucleated spermatogonial giant cells in the testes .
Topotecan may impair fertility in women and men .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 2 Small Cell Lung Cancer Topotecan hydrochloride for injection was studied in 426 patients with recurrent or progressive small cell lung cancer in 1 randomized , comparative trial and in 3 single - arm trials .
Randomized Comparative Trial : In a randomized , comparative , Phase 3 trial , 107 patients were treated with topotecan hydrochloride for injection ( 1 . 5 mg / m2 / day × 5 days starting on day 1 of a 21 - day course ) and 104 patients were treated with CAV ( 1 , 000 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide , 45 mg / m2 doxorubicin , 2 mg vincristine administered sequentially on day 1 of a 21 - day course ) .
All patients were considered sensitive to first - line chemotherapy ( responders who then subsequently progressed ≥ 60 days after completion of first - line therapy ) .
A total of 77 % of patients treated with topotecan hydrochloride for injection and 79 % of patients treated with CAV received platinum / etoposide with or without other agents as first - line chemotherapy .
Response rates , response duration , time to progression , and survival are shown in Table 6 .

The time to response was similar in both arms : topotecan hydrochloride for injection median of 6 weeks ( range 2 . 4 to 15 . 7 ) versus CAV median 6 weeks ( range 5 . 1 to 18 . 1 ) .
Changes on a disease - related symptom scale in patients who received topotecan hydrochloride for injection or who received CAV are presented in Table 7 .
It should be noted that not all patients had all symptoms , nor did all patients respond to all questions .
Each symptom was rated on a 4 - category scale with an improvement defined as a change in 1 category from baseline sustained over 2 courses .
Limitations in interpretation of the rating scale and responses preclude formal statistical analysis .

b Number of patients with baseline and at least 1 post - baseline assessment .
Single - Arm Trials : Topotecan hydrochloride for injection was also studied in 3 open - label , non - comparative trials in a total of 319 patients with recurrent or progressive small cell lung cancer after treatment with first - line chemotherapy .
In all 3 trials , patients were stratified as either sensitive ( responders who then subsequently progressed ≥ 90 days after completion of first - line therapy ) or refractory ( no response to first - line chemotherapy or who responded to first - line therapy and then progressed within 90 days of completing first - line therapy ) .
Response rates ranged from 11 % to 31 % for sensitive patients and 2 % to 7 % for refractory patients .
Median time to progression and median survival were similar in all 3 studies and the comparative trial .
14 . 3 Cervical Cancer In a comparative trial , 147 eligible women were randomized to topotecan hydrochloride for injection ( 0 . 75 mg / m2 / day IV over 30 minutes × 3 consecutive days starting on day 1 of a 21 - day course ) plus cisplatin ( 50 mg / m2 on day 1 ) and 146 eligible women were randomized to cisplatin ( 50 mg / m2 IV on day 1 of a 21 - day course ) .
All patients had histologically confirmed Stage IV B , recurrent , or persistent carcinoma of the cervix considered not amenable to curative treatment with surgery and / or radiation .
Fifty - six percent ( 56 % ) of patients treated with topotecan hydrochloride for injection plus cisplatin and 56 % of patients treated with cisplatin had received prior cisplatin with or without other agents as first - line chemotherapy .
Median survival of eligible patients receiving topotecan hydrochloride for injection plus cisplatin was 9 . 4 months ( 95 % CI : 7 . 9 to 11 . 9 ) compared to 6 . 5 months ( 95 % CI : 5 . 8 to 8 . 8 ) among patients randomized to cisplatin alone with a log rank P - value of 0 . 033 ( significance level was 0 . 044 after adjusting for the interim analysis ) .
The unadjusted hazard ratio for overall survival was 0 . 76 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 59 to 0 . 98 ) .
