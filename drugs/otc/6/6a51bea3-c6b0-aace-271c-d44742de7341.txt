Do not mix intravenous medications or parenteral nutrition solutions with MultiHance .
Do not administer other medications in the same intravenous line with MultiHance .
2 . 4 Directions for Proper Use of MultiHance Multipack The pharmacy bulk package is used as a multiple dose container with an appropriate transfer device to fill empty syringes .
MultiHance Multipack injection should be drawn into the syringe and administered using sterile technique .
Unused portions of the drug must be discarded .
When MultiHance Multipack injection is to be injected using plastic disposable syringes , the agent should be drawn into the syringe and used immediately .
• The transferring of MultiHance ( gadobenate dimeglumine ) injection from the Pharmacy Bulk Package should be performed in a suitable work area , such as a laminar flow hood , utilizing aseptic technique .
• The container closure may be penetrated only one time , utilizing a suitable transfer device .
Once the pharmacy bulk package is punctured , it should not be removed from the aseptic work area during the entire period of use .
• The withdrawal of container contents should be accomplished without delay .
However , should this not be possible , a maximum time of 8 hours from initial closure entry is permitted to complete fluid transfer operation .
Any unused MultiHance Multipack injection must be discarded 8 hours after initial puncture of the bulk package .
• Temperature of container after the closure has been entered should not exceed 25 ° C ( 77 ° F ) .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS MultiHance is a sterile , nonpyrogenic , clear , colorless to slightly yellow aqueous solution for intravenous use only , containing 529 mg gadobenate dimeglumine per mL .
Each mL of MultiHance Injection contains 529 mg gadobenate dimeglumine .
( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS MultiHance is contraindicated in patients with known allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to gadolinium - based contrast agents [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
MultiHance is contraindicated in patients with known allergic or hypersensitivity reactions to gadolinium - based contrast agents .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis has occurred in patients with impaired elimination of GBCAs .
Higher than recommended dosing or repeated dosing appears to increase the risk ( 5 . 1 ) • Hypersensitivity : anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions with cardiovascular , respiratory and cutaneous manifestations , ranging from mild to severe reactions including shock can occur .
Monitor patients closely for need of emergency cardiorespiratory support .
( 5 . 2 ) • Gadolinium is retained for months or years in brain , bone , and other organs .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis ( NSF ) Gadolinium - based contrast agents ( GBCAs ) increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis ( NSF ) among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs .
Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non - contrast enhanced MRI or other modalities .
The GBCA - associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic , severe kidney disease ( GFR < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) as well as patients with acute kidney injury .
The risk appears lower for patients with chronic , moderate kidney disease ( GFR 30 - 59 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) and little , if any , for patients with chronic , mild kidney disease ( GFR 60 - 89 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) .
NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin , muscle and internal organs .
Report any diagnosis of NSF following MultiHance administration to Bracco Diagnostics ( 1 - 800 - 257 - 5181 ) or FDA ( 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch ) .
Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function .
Features of acute kidney injury consist of rapid ( over hours to days ) and usually reversible decrease in kidney function , commonly in the setting of surgery , severe infection , injury or drug - induced kidney toxicity .
Serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR may not reliably assess renal function in the setting of acute kidney injury .
For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function ( e . g . , age > 60 years , diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension ) , estimate the GFR through laboratory testing .
Among the factors that may increase the risk for NSF are repeated or higher than recommended doses of a GBCA and the degree of renal impairment at the time of exposure .
Record the specific GBCA and the dose administered to a patient .
For patients at highest risk for NSF , do not exceed the recommended MultiHance dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug prior to re - administration .
For patients receiving hemodialysis , physicians may consider the prompt initiation of hemodialysis following the administration of a GBCA in order to enhance the contrast agent ’ s elimination .
The usefulness of hemodialysis in the prevention of NSF is unknown [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ] .
5 . 2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported , involving cardiovascular , respiratory , and / or cutaneous manifestations .
Some patients experienced circulatory collapse and died .
In most cases , initial symptoms occurred within minutes of MultiHance administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment .
Prior to MultiHance administration , ensure the availability of personnel trained and medications to treat hypersensitivity reactions .
If such a reaction occurs stop MultiHance and immediately begin appropriate therapy .
Additionally , consider the risk for hypersensitivity reactions , especially in patients with a history of hypersensitivity reactions or a history of asthma or other allergic disorders .
Observe patients for signs and symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction during and for up to 2 hours after MultiHance administration .
5 . 3 Gadolinium Retention Gadolinium is retained for months or years in several organs .
The highest concentrations ( nanomoles per gram of tissue ) have been identified in the bone , followed by other organs ( e . g . brain , skin , kidney , liver , and spleen ) .
The duration of retention also varies by tissue and is longest in bone .
Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs .
At equivalent doses , gadolinium retention varies among the linear agents with Omniscan ( gadodiamide ) and Optimark ( gadoversetamide ) causing greater retention than other linear agents [ Eovist ( gadoxetate disodium ) , Magnevist ( gadopentetate dimeglumine ) , MultiHance ( gadobenate dimeglumine ) ] .
Retention is lowest and similar among the macrocyclic GBCAs [ Dotarem ( gadoterate meglumine ) , Gadavist ( gadobutrol ) , ProHance ( gadoteridol ) ] .
Consequences of gadolinium retention in the brain have not been established .
Pathologic and clinical consequences of GBCA administration and retention in skin and other organs have been established in patients with impaired renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
There are rare reports of pathologic skin changes in patients with normal renal function .
Adverse events involving multiple organ systems have been reported in patients with normal renal function without an established causal link to gadolinium retention [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
While clinical consequences of gadolinium retention have not been established in patients with normal renal function , certain patients might be at higher risk .
These include patients requiring multiple lifetime doses , pregnant and pediatric patients , and patients with inflammatory conditions .
Consider the retention characteristics of the agent when choosing a GBCA for these patients .
Minimize repetitive GBCA imaging studies , particularly closely spaced studies when possible .
5 . 4 Acute Renal Failure In patients with renal insufficiency , acute renal failure requiring dialysis or worsening renal function have occurred with the use of gadolinium - based contrast agents .
The risk of renal failure may increase with increasing dose of the contrast agent .
Screen all patients for renal dysfunction by obtaining a history and / or laboratory tests .
Consider follow - up renal function assessments for patients with a history of renal dysfunction .
5 . 5 Extravasation and Injection Site Reactions Extravasation of MultiHance may lead to injection site reactions , characterized by local pain or burning sensation , swelling , blistering , and necrosis .
In animal experiments , local reactions including eschar and necrosis were noted even on Day 8 post perivenous injection of MultiHance .
Exercise caution to avoid local extravasation during intravenous administration of MultiHance .
If extravasation occurs , evaluate and treat as necessary if local reactions develop .
5 . 6 Cardiac Arrhythmias Cardiac arrhythmias have been observed in patients receiving MultiHance in clinical trials [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Assess patients for underlying conditions or medications that predispose to arrhythmias .
A double - blind , placebo - controlled , 24 - hour post dose continuous monitoring , crossover study in 47 subjects evaluated the effect of 0 . 2 mmol / kg MultiHance on ECG intervals , including QTc .
The average changes in QTc values compared with placebo were minimal ( < 5 msec ) .
QTc prolongation between 30 and 60 msec were noted in 20 subjects who received MultiHance vs . 11 subjects who received placebo .
Prolongations ≥ 61 msec were noted in 6 subjects who received MultiHance and in 3 subjects who received placebo .
None of these subjects had associated malignant arrhythmias .
The effects on QTc by MultiHance dose , other drugs , and medical conditions were not systematically studied .
5 . 7 Interference with Visualization of Certain Lesions Certain lesions seen on non - contrast images may not be seen on contrast - images .
Exercise caution when interpreting contrast MR images in the absence of companion non - contrast MR images .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label : • Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Hypersensitivity reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] The most commonly reported adverse reactions are nausea ( 1 . 3 % ) and headache ( 1 . 2 % ) .
( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Bracco Diagnostics Inc . at 1 - 800 - 257 - 5181 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch 6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Adults In clinical trials with MultiHance , a total of 4967 adult subjects ( 137 healthy volunteers and 4830 patients ) received MultiHance at doses ranging from 0 . 005 to 0 . 4 mmol / kg .
There were 2838 ( 57 % ) men and 2129 ( 43 % ) women with a mean age of 56 . 5 years ( range 18 to 93 years ) .
A total of 4403 ( 89 % ) subjects were Caucasian , 134 ( 3 % ) Black , 275 ( 6 % ) Asian , 40 ( 1 % ) Hispanic , 70 ( 1 % ) in other racial groups , and for 45 ( 1 % ) subjects , race was not reported .
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in adult subjects who received MultiHance were nausea ( 1 . 3 % ) and headache ( 1 . 2 % ) .
Most adverse reactions were mild to moderate in intensity .

No subject died during study participation .
6 . 2 Post - marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of MultiHance .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Immune System Disorders : Anaphylactic , anaphylactoid and hypersensitivity reactions manifested with various degrees of severity up to anaphylactic shock , loss of consciousness and death .
The reactions generally involved signs or symptoms of respiratory , cardiovascular , and / or mucocutaneous abnormalities .
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : Extravasation of MultiHance may lead to injection site reactions , characterized by local pain or burning sensation , swelling , blistering , and necrosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Adverse events with variable onset and duration have been reported after GBCA administration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
These include fatigue , asthenia , pain syndromes , and heterogeneous clusters of symptoms in the neurological , cutaneous , and musculoskeletal systems .
Skin : Gadolinium associated plaques .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Transporter - Based Drug - Drug Interactions MultiHance and other drugs may compete for the canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter ( MOAT also referred to as MRP2 or ABCC2 ) .
Therefore MultiHance may prolong the systemic exposure of drugs such as cisplatin , anthracyclines ( e . g . doxorubicin , daunorubicin ) , vinca alkaloids ( e . g . vincristine ) , methotrexate , etoposide , tamoxifen , and paclitaxel .
In particular , consider the potential for prolonged drug exposure in patients with decreased MOAT activity ( e . g . Dubin Johnson syndrome ) .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : Use only if imaging is essential during pregnancy and cannot be delayed .
( 8 . 1 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary GBCAs cross the placenta and result in fetal exposure and gadolinium retention .
The human data on the association between GBCAs and adverse fetal outcomes are limited and inconclusive ( see Data ) .
In animal reproduction studies , gadobenate dimeglumine has been shown to be teratogenic in rabbits following repeated intravenous administration during organogenesis at doses up to 6 times the recommended human dose .
There were no adverse developmental effects observed in rats with intravenous administration of gadobenate dimeglumine during organogenesis at doses up to three times the recommended human dose ( see Data ) .
Because of the potential risks of gadolinium to the fetus , use MultiHance only if imaging is essential and cannot be delayed .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and is 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data Contrast enhancement is visualized in the placenta and fetal tissues after maternal GBCA administration .
Cohort studies and case reports on exposure to GBCAs during pregnancy have not reported a clear association between GBCAs and adverse effects in the exposed neonates .
However , a retrospective cohort study , comparing pregnant women who had a GBCA MRI to pregnant women who did not have an MRI , reported a higher occurrence of stillbirths and neonatal deaths in the group receiving GBCA MRI .
Limitations of this study include a lack of comparison with non - contrast MRI and lack of information about the maternal indication for MRI .
Overall , these data preclude a reliable evaluation of the potential risk of adverse fetal outcomes with the use of GBCAs in pregnancy .
Animal Data Gadolinium Retention GBCAs administered to pregnant non - human primates ( 0 . 1 mmol / kg on gestational days 85 and 135 ) result in measurable gadolinium concentration in the offspring in bone , brain , skin , liver , kidney , and spleen for at least 7 months .
GBCAs administered to pregnant mice ( 2 mmol / kg daily on gestational days 16 through 19 ) result in measurable gadolinium concentrations in the pups in bone , brain , kidney , liver , blood , muscle , and spleen at one month postnatal age .
Reproductive Toxicology Gadobenate dimeglumine has been shown to be teratogenic in rabbits when administered intravenously at 2 mmol / kg / day ( 6 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) during organogenesis ( day 6 to 18 ) inducing microphthalmia / small eye and / or focal retinal fold in 3 fetuses from 3 separate litters .
In addition , MultiHance administered intravenously at 3 mmol / kg / day ( 10 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) has been shown to increase intrauterine deaths in rabbits .
There was no evidence that MultiHance induced teratogenic effects in rats at doses up to 2 mmol / kg / day ( 3 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) , however , rat dams exhibited no systemic toxicity at this dose .
There were no adverse effects on the birth , survival , growth , development and fertility of the F1 generation at doses up to 2 mmol / kg in a rat peri - and post - natal ( Segment III ) study .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited literature reports that breastfeeding after gadobenate dimeglumine administration to the mother would result in the infant receiving an oral dose of 0 . 001 % - 0 . 04 % of the maternal dose .
There is no information on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production .
Additionally , there is limited GBCA gastrointestinal absorption .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered together with the mother ’ s clinical need for MultiHance and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from MultiHance or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use MultiHance is approved for intravenous use for MRI of the CNS to visualize lesions with abnormal blood brain barrier or abnormal vascularity of the brain , spine , and associated tissues in pediatric patients from birth , including term neonates , to less than 17 years of age .
Pediatric use is based on evidence of effectiveness in adults and in 202 pediatric patients 2 years of age and older , in addition to experience in 105 pediatric patients birth to less than 2 years of age that supported extrapolation from adult data [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Adverse reactions in pediatric patients were similar to those reported in adults [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
No dose adjustment according to age is necessary in pediatric patients two years of age and older .
For pediatric patients , less than 2 years of age , the recommended dosage range is 0 . 1 to 0 . 2 mL / kg [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) , Pharmacokinetics ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The safety of MultiHance has not been established in preterm neonates .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of 4967 adult subjects in clinical studies of MultiHance , 33 % were 65 or older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these elderly subjects and the younger subjects .
The drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to MultiHance may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function it may be useful to monitor renal function .
10 OVERDOSAGE Clinical consequences of overdosage with MultiHance have not been reported .
Treatment of an overdosage should be directed toward support of vital functions and prompt institution of symptomatic therapy .
In a Phase 1 clinical study , doses up to 0 . 4 mmol / kg were administered to patients .
MultiHance has been shown to be dialyzable [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION MultiHance injection is supplied as a sterile , nonpyrogenic , clear , colorless to slightly yellow aqueous solution intended for intravenous use only .
Each mL of MultiHance contains 529 mg gadobenate dimeglumine and water for injection .
MultiHance contains no preservatives .
Gadobenate dimeglumine is chemically designated as ( 4 RS ) - [ 4 - carboxy - 5 , 8 , 11 - tris ( carboxymethyl ) - 1 - phenyl - 2 - oxa - 5 , 8 , 11 - triazatridecan - 13 - oato ( 5 - ) ] gadolinate ( 2 - ) dihydrogen compound with 1 - deoxy - 1 - ( methylamino ) - D - glucitol ( 1 : 2 ) with a molecular weight of 1058 . 2 and an empirical formula of C22H28GdN3O11 • 2C7H17NO5 .
The structural formula is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] MultiHance has a pH of 6 . 5 - 7 . 5 .
Pertinent physicochemical parameters are provided below : Osmolality 1 . 970 osmol / kg @ 37 ° C Viscosity 5 . 3 mPas @ 37 ° C Density 1 . 220 g / mL @ 20 ° C MultiHance has an osmolality 6 . 9 times that of plasma ( 285 mOsmol / kg water ) and is hypertonic under conditions of use .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Gadobenate dimeglumine is a paramagnetic agent and , as such , develops a magnetic moment when placed in a magnetic field .
The large magnetic moment produced by the paramagnetic agent results in a large local magnetic field , which can enhance the relaxation rates of water protons in its vicinity leading to an increase of signal intensity ( brightness ) of tissue .
In magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , visualization of normal and pathological tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occur with 1 ) differences in proton density ; 2 ) differences of the spin - lattice or longitudinal relaxation times ( T1 ) ; and 3 ) differences in the spin - spin or transverse relaxation time ( T2 ) .
When placed in a magnetic field , gadobenate dimeglumine decreases the T1 and T2 relaxation time in target tissues .
At recommended doses , the effect is observed with greatest sensitivity in the T1 - weighted sequences .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Unlike other tested paramagnetic contrast agents ( See Table 3 ) , MultiHance demonstrates weak and transient interactions with serum proteins that causes slowing in the molecular tumbling dynamics , resulting in strong increases in relaxivity in solutions containing serum proteins .
The improved relaxation effect can contribute to increased contrast - to - noise ratio and lesion - to - brain ratio , which may improve visualization .
r1 and r2 relaxivities indicate the efficiency in shortening T1 and T2 relaxation times , respectively .

Uptake of MultiHance into hepatocytes has been demonstrated .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Three single - dose intravenous studies were conducted in 32 healthy male subjects to assess the pharmacokinetics of gadobenate dimeglumine .
The doses administered in these studies ranged from 0 . 005 to 0 . 4 mmol / kg .
Upon injection , the meglumine salt is completely dissociated from the gadobenate dimeglumine complex .
Thus , the pharmacokinetics is based on the assay of gadobenate ion , the MRI contrast effective ion in gadobenate dimeglumine .
Data for plasma concentration and area under the curve demonstrated linear dependence on the administered dose .
The pharmacokinetics of gadobenate ion following intravenous administration can be best described using a two - compartment model .
Distribution Gadobenate ion has a rapid distribution half - life ( reported as mean ± SD ) of 0 . 084 ± 0 . 012 to 0 . 605 ± 0 . 072 hours .
Volume of distribution of the central compartment ranged from 0 . 074 ± 0 . 017 to 0 . 158 ± 0 . 038 L / kg , and estimates of volume of distribution by area ranged from 0 . 170 ± 0 . 016 to 0 . 282 ± 0 . 079 L / kg .
These latter estimates are approximately equivalent to the average volume of extracellular body water in man .
In vitro studies showed no appreciable binding of gadobenate ion to human serum proteins .
Following GBCA administration , gadolinium is present for months or years in brain , bone , skin , and other organs [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Elimination Gadobenate ion is eliminated predominately via the kidneys , with 78 % to 96 % of an administered dose recovered in the urine .
Total plasma clearance and renal clearance estimates of gadobenate ion were similar , ranging from 0 . 093 ± 0 . 010 to 0 . 133 ± 0 . 270 L / hr / kg and 0 . 082 ± 0 . 007 to 0 . 104 ± 0 . 039 L / hr / kg , respectively .
The clearance is similar to that of substances that are subject to glomerular filtration .
The mean elimination half - life ranged from 1 . 17 ± 0 . 26 to 2 . 02 ± 0 . 60 hours .
A small percentage of the administered dose ( 0 . 6 % to 4 % ) is eliminated via the biliary route and recovered in feces .
Metabolism There was no detectable biotransformation of gadobenate ion .
Dissociation of gadobenate ion in vivo has been shown to be minimal , with less than 1 % of the free chelating agent being recovered alone in feces .
Pharmacokinetics in Special Population Renal Impairment : A single intravenous dose of 0 . 2 mmol / kg of MultiHance was administered to 20 subjects with impaired renal function ( 6 men and 3 women with moderate renal impairment [ urine creatinine clearance > 30 to < 60 mL / min ] and 5 men and 6 women with severe renal impairment [ urine creatinine clearance > 10 to < 30 mL / min ] ) .
Mean estimates of the elimination half - life were 6 . 1 ± 3 . 0 and 9 . 5 ± 3 . 1 hours for the moderate and severe renal impairment groups , respectively as compared with 1 . 0 to 2 . 0 hours in healthy volunteers .
Hemodialysis : A single intravenous dose of 0 . 2 mmol / kg of MultiHance was administered to 11 subjects ( 5 males and 6 females ) with end - stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis to determine the pharmacokinetics and dialyzability of gadobenate .
Approximately 72 % of the dose was recovered by hemodialysis over a 4 - hour period .
The mean elimination half - life on dialysis was 1 . 21 ± 0 . 29 hours as compared with 42 . 4 ± 24 . 4 hours when off dialysis .
Hepatic Impairment : A single intravenous dose of 0 . 1 mmol / kg of MultiHance was administered to 11 subjects ( 8 males and 3 females ) with impaired liver function ( Class B or C modified Child - Pugh Classification ) .
Hepatic impairment had little effect on the pharmacokinetics of MultiHance with the parameters being similar to those calculated for healthy subjects .
Gender , Age , Race : A multiple regression analysis performed using pooled data from several pharmacokinetic studies found no significant effect of sex upon the pharmacokinetics of gadobenate .
Clearance appeared to decrease slightly with increasing age .
Since variations due to age appeared marginal , dosage adjustment for geriatric population is not recommended .
Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been systematically studied .
Pediatric : A population pharmacokinetic analysis incorporated data from 25 healthy subjects ( 14 males and 11 females ) and 15 subjects undergoing MR imaging of the central nervous system ( 7 males and 8 females ) between ages of 2 and 16 years .
The subjects received a single intravenous dose of 0 . 1 mmol / kg of MultiHance .
The geometric mean Cmax was 62 . 3 μg / mL ( n = 16 ) in children 2 to 5 years of age , and 64 . 2 μg / mL ( n = 24 ) in children older than 5 years .
The geometric mean AUC 0 - ∞ was 77 . 9 μg ⋅ h / mL in children 2 - 5 years of age ( n = 16 ) and 82 . 6 μg ⋅ h / mL in children older than 5 years ( n = 24 ) .
The geometric mean half - life was 1 . 2 hours in children 2 to 5 years of age and 0 . 93 hours in children older than 5 years .
There was no significant gender - related difference in the pharmacokinetic parameters in the pediatric patients .
Over 80 % of the dose was recovered in urine after 24 hours .
Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate similar AUC and Cmax values for MultiHance in pediatric subjects less than 2 years when compared to those reported for adults ; no age - based dose adjustment is necessary for this pediatric population .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of MultiHance .
The results for MultiHance were negative in the following genetic toxicity studies : 1 ) in vitro bacteria reverse mutation assays , 2 ) an in vitro gene mutation assay in mammalian cells , 3 ) an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay , 4 ) an in vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis assay , and 5 ) an in vivo micronucleus assay in rats .
MultiHance had no effect on fertility and reproductive performance at IV doses of up to 2 mmol / kg / day ( 3 times the human dose on body surface basis ) for 13 weeks in male rats and for 32 days in female rats .
However , vacuolation in testes and abnormal spermatogenic cells were observed when MultiHance was intravenously administered to male rats at 3 mmol / kg / day ( 5 times the human dose on body surface basis ) for 28 days .
The effects were not reversible following 28 - day recovery period .
The effects were not reported in dog and monkey studies ( at doses up to about 11 and 10 times the human dose on body surface basis for dogs ( 28 days dosing ) and monkeys ( 14 days dosing ) , respectively ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 MRI of the CNS Adults : MultiHance was evaluated in 426 adult patients in 2 controlled clinical trials of the central nervous system ( Study A and Study B ) , enrolling 217 men and 209 women with a mean age of 52 years ( range 18 to 88 years ) .
The racial and ethnic representations were 88 % Caucasian , 6 % Black , 4 % Hispanic , 1 % Asian , and 1 % other racial or ethnic groups .
These trials were designed to compare MultiHance contrast MRI to non - contrast MRI alone .
In Study A , patients highly suspected of having a lesion ( s ) of the CNS based on nuclear medicine imaging , computed tomography ( CT ) , contrast CT , MRI , contrast - MRI , or angiography were randomized to receive two MRI evaluations with 0 . 05 mmol / kg ( n = 140 ) or 0 . 1 mmol / kg ( n = 136 ) of MultiHance .
In Study B , patients with known metastatic disease to the CNS were randomized to receive two MRI evaluations with 0 . 05 mmol / kg ( n = 74 ) or 0 . 1 mmol / kg ( n = 76 ) of MultiHance .
MRI scans were performed pre - contrast and within 5 minutes after each injection .
The studies were designed to evaluate the effect of MultiHance MRI compared to the non - contrast MRI on a lesion level .
Pre - contrast , post - contrast , and pre - plus - post contrast images ( paired images ) were independently evaluated by three blinded readers .
The images were evaluated for the following endpoints using a scale from 0 to 4 : the degree of lesion border delineation , the degree of visualization of lesion internal morphology , and the degree of lesion contrast enhancement .
Lesion counting was also performed for the pre - contrast and paired image sets .
The 0 . 1 mmol / kg dose of MultiHance demonstrated consistently better visualization for all readers for all visualization endpoints .
However , the 0 . 05 mmol / kg dose of MultiHance provided inconsistent visualization results between readers .
Comparison of pre - contrast versus post - contrast ( 0 . 1 mmol / kg ) images showed that the mean score differences were significant and favored contrast for subjects in Study B ( all subjects with known metastatic lesions ) and for subjects with known tumors in Study A . However , the mean score differences between the pre - contrast and post - contrast images were not significant for non - tumor patients in Study A .
These negative results may be attributed to a lack of lesion enhancement in non - tumor CNS disease .
Table 4 shows a comparison of paired images ( pre - and post - contrast ) versus pre - contrast images with respect to the difference in the mean score and with respect to the proportion of lesions read as better , worse , or the same as the pre - contrast MRI images .
Table 4 shows that based on a lesion - level analysis 0 . 1 mmol / kg MultiHance provided a statistically significant improvement for the three structural parameters evaluated .
Also , more lesions were seen in the paired images than in the pre - contrast images alone .
( a ) Difference of means = ( paired mean ) - ( pre mean ) ( b ) Worse = paired score is less than the pre score Same = paired score is the same as the pre score Better = paired score is greater than the pre score * Statistically significant for the mean ( paired t test ) Table 4 : LESION LEVEL RESULTS OF MRI CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM ADULT STUDIES WITH 0 . 1 mmol / kg MULTIHANCE Study A Study B Reader 1 Reader 2 Reader 3 Reader 1 Reader 2 Reader 3 Endpoints N = 395 N = 384 N = 299 N = 245 N = 275 N = 254 Border Delineation : Difference of Means ( a ) 0 . 8 * 0 . 6 * 0 . 8 * 1 . 8 * 1 . 5 * 1 . 9 * Worse ( b ) Same Better 44 ( 11 % ) 146 ( 37 % ) 205 ( 52 % ) 61 ( 16 % ) 168 ( 44 % ) 155 ( 40 % ) 57 ( 19 % ) 89 ( 30 % ) 153 ( 51 % ) 13 ( 5 % ) 11 ( 5 % ) 221 ( 90 % ) 24 ( 9 % ) 19 ( 7 % ) 232 ( 84 % ) 15 ( 6 % ) 18 ( 7 % ) 221 ( 87 % ) Internal Morphology : Difference of Means 0 . 8 * 0 . 6 * 0 . 7 * 1 . 7 * 1 . 4 * 2 . 1 * Worse Same Better 37 ( 10 % ) 147 ( 37 % ) 211 ( 53 % ) 63 ( 17 % ) 151 ( 39 % ) 170 ( 44 % ) 62 ( 21 % ) 84 ( 28 % ) 153 ( 51 % ) 13 ( 5 % ) 16 ( 7 % ) 216 ( 88 % ) 26 ( 10 % ) 22 ( 8 % ) 227 ( 82 % ) 14 ( 5 % ) 22 ( 9 % ) 218 ( 86 % ) Contrast Enhancement : Difference of Means 0 . 7 * 0 . 5 * 0 . 8 * 1 . 9 * 1 . 3 * 1 . 9 * Worse Same Better 75 ( 19 % ) 148 ( 37 % ) 172 ( 44 % ) 74 ( 19 % ) 152 ( 40 % ) 158 ( 41 % ) 50 ( 17 % ) 109 ( 36 % ) 140 ( 47 % ) 13 ( 5 % ) 11 ( 5 % ) 221 ( 90 % ) 32 ( 12 % ) 21 ( 7 % ) 222 ( 81 % ) 17 ( 7 % ) 14 ( 5 % ) 223 ( 88 % ) Pediatric 2 to 17 years The efficacy and safety of MultiHance were evaluated in 92 pediatric patients with known or highly suspected disease of the central nervous system .
MRI scans were performed pre - contrast and within 3 to 10 minutes following the administration of MultiHance 0 . 1 mmol / kg .
Pre - contrast , post - contrast , and pre - plus - post contrast images ( paired images ) were independently evaluated by three blinded readers on a lesion level .
The images were evaluated for the same endpoints as in the adult central nervous system trials using a scale from 0 to 4 : the degree of lesion border delineation , the degree of visualization of lesion internal morphology , and the degree of lesion contrast enhancement .
Lesion counting was also performed for the pre - contrast and paired image sets .
The pre - contrast versus the paired image set was the primary comparison .
Forty - nine percent of study subjects were male and the overall mean age was 10 . 6 years ( range 2 to 17 years ) .
The racial and ethnic representations were 77 % Caucasian , 13 % Asian , 5 % Black , and 4 % other racial or ethnic groups .
MultiHance increased lesion border delineation , lesion internal morphology , and lesion contrast enhancement relative to non - contrast and these results were comparable to those seen in adults .
Pediatrics below 2 years A study of 90 pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age was performed which supports extrapolation of CNS efficacy findings from adults and older pediatric patients .
Three independent , blinded readers evaluated pre - contrast MRI image sets and paired pre - plus - post - contrast MRI image sets using MultiHance and rated the images according to three co - primary endpoints at a lesion level for the primary analysis .
Two of the three readers reported improvement in the paired image sets in each of the three co - primary endpoints of lesion border delineation , visualization of lesion internal morphology , and lesion contrast enhancement .
14 . 2 MRA of Renal and Aorto - ilio - femoral Vessels Safety and efficacy of MultiHance for use in MRA were evaluated in two prospective , multi - center , open - label , clinical trials ( one for each arterial vascular territory : renal and aorto - ilio - femoral ) .
Out of 580 patients who received Multihance in these two trials , 62 . 2 % were men and 90 . 9 % were Caucasian ; the average age was 63 . 4 years ( range 18 to 93 years ) .
In both trials , patients with known or suspected arterial disease underwent MRA with and without MultiHance as well as catheter - based digital subtraction angiography ( DSA ) .
Assessment of diagnostic efficacy for detecting / excluding clinically significant steno - occlusive disease ( ≥ 51 % stenosis measured with electronic calipers ) was based on comparisons of sensitivity and specificity between MultiHance MRA and non - contrast MRA , with DSA as a reference standard .
In each vascular territory , the primary efficacy analyses were designed to demonstrate superiority in sensitivity and non - inferiority in specificity of MultiHance MRA to non - contrast MRA at the vessel - segment level .
The interpretation of MRA images from both trials was conducted by three independent radiologist readers who were blinded to clinical data , including the DSA results .
The pre - specified success criteria were to be achieved by at least the same two readers for all primary analyses .
Results of both trials showed a statistically significant increase in sensitivity and specificity of MultiHance MRA over non - contrast MRA in detecting clinically significant steno - occlusive disease .
Table 5 summarizes the efficacy results by reader .

Monroe Twp , NJ 08831 By BIPSO GmbH 78224 Singen ( Germany ) Revised April 2018 This Medication Guide has been approved by the U . S . Food and Drug Administration Issued 04 / 2018 COEB403 MEDICATION GUIDE MULTIHANCE ® ( məl - tē - han ( t ) s ) ( gadobenate dimeglumine ) Injection for intravenous use What is MULTIHANCE ?
• MULTIHANCE is a prescription medicine called a gadolinium - based contrast agent ( GBCA ) .
MULTIHANCE , like other GBCAs , is injected into your vein and used with a magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scanner .
• An MRI exam with a GBCA , including MULTIHANCE , helps your doctor to see problems better than an MRI exam without a GBCA .
• Your doctor has reviewed your medical records and has determined that you would benefit from using a GBCA with your MRI exam .
What is the most important information I should know about MULTIHANCE ?
• MULTIHANCE contains a metal called gadolinium .
Small amounts of gadolinium can stay in your body including the brain , bones , skin and other parts of your body for a long time ( several months to years ) .
• It is not known how gadolinium may affect you , but so far , studies have not found harmful effects in patients with normal kidneys .
• Rarely , patients have reported pains , tiredness , and skin , muscle or bone ailments for a long time , but these symptoms have not been directly linked to gadolinium .
• There are different GBCAs that can be used for your MRI exam .
The amount of gadolinium that stays in the body is different for different gadolinium medicines .
Gadolinium stays in the body more after Omniscan or Optimark than after Eovist , Magnevist , or MultiHance .
Gadolinium stays in the body the least after Dotarem , Gadavist , or ProHance .
• People who get many doses of gadolinium medicines , women who are pregnant and young children may be at increased risk from gadolinium staying in the body .
• Some people with kidney problems who get gadolinium medicines can develop a condition with severe thickening of the skin , muscles and other organs in the body ( nephrogenic systemic fibrosis ) .
Your healthcare provider should screen you to see how well your kidneys are working before you receive MULTIHANCE .
Do not receive MULTIHANCE if you have had a severe allergic reaction to GBCAs including gadobenate dimeglumine , or any of the ingredients in MULTIHANCE .
Before receiving MULTIHANCE , tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions , including if you : • have had any MRI procedures in the past where you received a GBCA .
Your healthcare provider may ask you for more information including the dates of these MRI procedures .
• are pregnant or plan to become pregnant .
It is not known if MULTIHANCE can harm your unborn baby .
Talk to your healthcare provider about the possible risks to an unborn baby if a GBCA such as MULTIHANCE is received during pregnancy • have kidney problems , diabetes , or high blood pressure .
• have had an allergic reaction to dyes ( contrast agents ) including GBCAs What are the possible side effects of MULTIHANCE ?
• See “ What is the most important information I should know about MULTIHANCE ? ”
• Allergic reactions .
MULTIHANCE can cause allergic reactions that can sometimes be serious .
Your healthcare provider will monitor you closely for symptoms of an allergic reaction .
The most common side effects of MULTIHANCE include : nausea , headache , feeling hot , or burning at the injection site .
These are not all the possible side effects of MULTIHANCE .
