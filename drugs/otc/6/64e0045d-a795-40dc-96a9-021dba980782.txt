6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In clinical trials , 139 patients with Fabry disease ( 79 females , 60 males , 92 % Caucasian , ages 16 to 72 years ) , who were naïve to GALAFOLD or previously treated with enzyme replacement therapy , were exposed to at least one dose of GALAFOLD .
Of the 139 patients , 127 patients were exposed to GALAFOLD 123 mg every other day for 6 months and 123 patients were exposed for greater than one year .
The clinical trials included one randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trial of 6 months duration followed by a 6 - month open - label treatment phase ( Study 1 ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
A second trial was a randomized , open - label , active - controlled clinical trial of 18 months duration in patients with Fabry disease receiving enzyme replacement therapy who were randomized to either switch to GALAFOLD or continue enzyme replacement therapy ( Study 2 ; NCT01218659 ) .
In addition , there were two open - label , long - term extension trials .
The most common adverse reactions reported with GALAFOLD ( ≥ 10 % ) during the 6 - month placebo - controlled , double - blind phase of Study 1 were headache , nasopharyngitis , urinary tract infection , nausea , and pyrexia .
Table 1 shows adverse reactions reported in at least 5 % of patients treated with GALAFOLD ( and at a higher rate than placebo ) during the 6 - month placebo - controlled , double - blind phase of Study 1 .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Study There is a study that collects data on pregnant women with Fabry disease , either exposed or unexposed to GALAFOLD .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients or obtain additional information by contacting the Pregnancy Coordinating Center at 1 - 888 - 239 - 0758 , email fabrypregnancy @ ubc . com , or visit www . fabrypregnancyregistry . com .
Risk Summary There were three pregnant women with Fabry disease exposed to GALAFOLD in clinical trials .
As such , the available data are not sufficient to assess drug associated risks of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , no adverse developmental effects were observed ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data No adverse developmental effects were observed with oral administration of migalastat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 26 and 54 times , respectively , the recommended dose based on AUC .
No effects on post - natal development were observed following oral administration of up to 500 mg / kg migalastat twice daily to pregnant rats ( 16 times the recommended dose based on AUC ) during organogenesis and through lactation .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no human data available on the presence of migalastat in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Migalastat is present in the milk of lactating rats ( see Data ) .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for GALAFOLD and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from GALAFOLD or from the underlying maternal condition .
There is a study that collects data on effects of GALAFOLD on lactation for women with Fabry disease and their neonates and infants up to 1 year of age who are exposed through breast milk .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients or obtain additional information by contacting the Pregnancy Coordinating Center at 1 - 888 - 239 - 0758 , email fabrypregnancy @ ubc . com , or visit www . fabrypregnancyregistry . com .
Data Animal Data Migalastat concentrations in milk from rats following oral administration of up to 500 mg / kg twice daily ( approximately 16 times the recommended human dose based on AUC ) was approximately 2 . 5 times higher than levels in the rat maternal plasma at 4 hours post - dose .
The concentration of migalastat in plasma from pups was approximately 11 times lower than the maternal plasma concentrations at 1 - hour post - dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility The effects of GALAFOLD on fertility in humans have not been studied .
Transient and fully reversible infertility in male rats was associated with migalastat treatment at a systemic exposure ( AUC ) equivalent to the human exposure at the recommended dose .
Complete reversibility was seen at 4 weeks after the termination of treatment .
Migalastat did not affect fertility in female rats [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of GALAFOLD have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of GALAFOLD did not include a sufficient number of patients 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Migalastat is substantially excreted by the kidneys .
Systemic exposure was significantly increased in subjects with severe renal impairment ( eGFR less than 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) .
GALAFOLD has not been studied in patients with Fabry disease who have an eGFR less than 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 .
GALAFOLD is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment or end - stage renal disease requiring dialysis .
No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment ( eGFR at least 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 and above ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION Migalastat , an alpha - galactosidase A ( alpha - Gal A ) pharmacological chaperone , is a low molecular weight iminosugar and an analogue of the terminal galactose of globotriaosylceramide ( GL - 3 ) .
Migalastat is present in the form of a hydrochloride salt in GALAFOLD .
The chemical name for migalastat hydrochloride is ( + ) - ( 2 R , 3 S , 4 R , 5 S ) - 2 - ( hydroxymethyl ) piperidine - 3 , 4 , 5 - triol hydrochloride .
Its molecular formula is C6H13NO4 • HCl , molecular mass is 199 . 63 g / mol , and its chemical structure is depicted below .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Migalastat hydrochloride is a white to almost white crystalline solid .
It is freely soluble in aqueous media within the pH range of 1 . 2 to 7 . 5 .
GALAFOLD ( migalastat ) capsules for oral administration contain 123 mg of migalastat ( equivalent to 150 mg migalastat hydrochloride ) as a white to pale brown powder and are supplied in a size “ 2 ” hard gelatin capsule with an opaque blue cap and an opaque white body imprinted with “ A1001 ” in black ink .
The inactive ingredients are magnesium stearate and pregelatinized starch .
Capsule shells consist of gelatin , indigotine - FD & C Blue 2 , and titanium dioxide .
The black ink consists of black iron oxide , potassium hydroxide , and shellac .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Migalastat is a pharmacological chaperone that reversibly binds to the active site of the alpha - galactosidase A ( alpha - Gal A ) protein ( encoded by the galactosidase alpha gene , GLA ) , which is deficient in Fabry disease .
This binding stabilizes alpha - Gal A allowing its trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum into the lysosome where it exerts its action .
In the lysosome , at a lower pH and at a higher concentration of relevant substrates , migalastat dissociates from alpha - Gal A allowing it to break down the glycosphingolipids globotriaosylceramide ( GL - 3 ) and globotriaosylsphingosine ( lyso - Gb3 ) .
Certain GLA variants ( mutations ) causing Fabry disease result in the production of abnormally folded and less stable forms of the alpha - Gal A protein which , however , retain enzymatic activity .
Those GLA variants , referred to as amenable variants , produce alpha - Gal A proteins that may be stabilized by migalastat thereby restoring their trafficking to lysosomes and their intralysosomal activity .
In Vitro Amenability Assay In an in vitro assay ( HEK - 293 assay ) , Human Embryonic Kidney ( HEK - 293 ) cell lines were transfected with specific GLA variants ( mutations ) which produced mutant alpha - Gal A proteins .
In the transfected cells , amenability of the GLA variants was assessed after a 5 - day incubation with 10 micromol / L migalastat .
A GLA variant was categorized as amenable if the resultant mutant alpha - Gal A activity ( measured in the cell lysates ) met two criteria : 1 ) it showed a relative increase of at least 20 % compared to the pre - treatment alpha - Gal A activity , and 2 ) it showed an absolute increase of at least 3 % of the wild - type ( normal ) alpha - Gal A activity .
The in vitro assay did not evaluate trafficking of the mutant alpha - Gal A proteins into the lysosome or the dissociation of migalastat from the mutant alpha - Gal A proteins within the lysosome .
Also , the in vitro assay did not test whether a GLA variant causes Fabry disease or not .
The GLA variants which are amenable to treatment with GALAFOLD , based on the in vitro assay data , are shown in Table 2 .
Inclusion of GLA variants in this table does not reflect interpretation of their clinical significance in Fabry disease .
Whether a certain amenable GLA variant in a patient with Fabry disease is disease - causing or not should be determined by the prescribing physician ( in consultation with a clinical genetics professional , if needed ) prior to treatment initiation .
Consultation with a clinical genetics professional is strongly recommended in cases where the amenable GLA variant is of uncertain clinical significance ( VUS , variant of uncertain significance ) or may be benign ( not causing Fabry disease ) .
Table 2 : Amenable GLA Variants Based on the In Vitro Assay * Based on available published data , the GLA variant c . 937 G > T , ( p . ( D313Y ) ) is considered benign ( not causing Fabry disease ) .
Consultation with a clinical genetics professional is strongly recommended in patients with Fabry disease who have this GLA variant as additional evaluations may be indicated .

12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In Study 1 , 31 of 50 patients with amenable GLA variants ( 18 on GALAFOLD , 13 on placebo ) had lyso - Gb3 assessments available after 6 months of treatment .
The median change from baseline to month 6 in plasma lyso - Gb3 ( nmol / L ) was - 2 . 37 ( range - 69 . 7 , 1 . 8 ) in patients on GALAFOLD and 0 . 53 ( range - 21 . 5 , 16 . 3 ) in patients on placebo .
In the open - label treatment phase of Study 1 , the 13 patients who were initially on placebo for 6 months and who switched to GALAFOLD for another 6 months had a median change in lyso - Gb3 ( nmol / L ) of - 2 . 72 ( range - 61 . 1 , - 0 . 3 ) .
The 18 patients who were treated with GALAFOLD for 6 months and then continued GALAFOLD in the open - label treatment phase of Study 1 for an additional 6 months had no further changes in plasma lyso - Gb3 .
In Study 2 , 46 of 56 patients with amenable GLA variants ( 31 on GALAFOLD , 15 on enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) ) had lyso - Gb3 assessments available after 18 months of treatment .
The median change from baseline to month 18 in plasma lyso - Gb3 ( nmol / L ) was 0 . 53 ( range - 2 . 27 , 28 . 3 ) in patients on GALAFOLD and - 0 . 03 ( range - 11 . 9 , 2 . 57 ) in patients on ERT .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose approximately 8 times the recommended dose , GALAFOLD did not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single GALAFOLD oral dose of 123 mg , the absolute bioavailability ( AUC ) of migalastat was approximately 75 % and the time to peak plasma concentration was approximately 3 hours .
Plasma migalastat exposure ( AUC0 - ∞ and Cmax ) demonstrated dose - proportional increases at oral doses from 75 mg to 1250 mg ( doses from 0 . 5 to 8 . 3 - fold of the approved recommended dosage ) .
Migalastat does not accumulate following administration of 123 mg GALAFOLD every other day .
Effect of Food : Administration of GALAFOLD one hour before a high - fat ( 850 calories ; 56 % from fat ) or light meal ( 507 calories ; 30 % from fat ) , or one hour after a light meal , reduced the mean migalastat AUC0 - ∞ by 37 % to 42 % and Cmax by 15 % to 39 % compared to the fasting state [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Effect of Beverages : A single - dose , 6 - way crossover pharmacokinetic study was conducted in 20 healthy subjects to evaluate plasma migalastat bioavailability of a 150 mg migalastat HCl capsule when administered with coffee and sweetened beverages relative to administration with water .
The rate of absorption ( tmax ) of migalastat was not affected by administration of coffee or sweetened beverages in comparison to water .
Consumption of 280 mL of coffee containing approximately 190 mg caffeine at the time of dosing resulted in significant decrease in migalastat systemic exposure ( mean reduction in AUC0 - ∞ by 57 % and mean reduction in Cmax by 60 % ) when compared to water .
The bioavailability of migalastat did not appreciably differ when administered with natural ( sucrose : 8027 ng · h / mL AUC0 - ∞ and 1265 ng / mL Cmax ) and artificial ( aspartame or acesulfame K : 9075 ng · h / mL , 8641 ng · h / mL AUC0 - ∞ and 1374 ng / mL , 1225 ng / mL Cmax respectively ) sweeteners when compared to water ( 8613 ng · h / mL AUC0 - ∞ and 1328 ng / mL Cmax ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Distribution The apparent volume of distribution ( Vz / F ) of migalastat in Fabry patients was approximately 89 L ( range : 77 to 133 L ) at steady state .
There was no detectable plasma protein binding following administration of [ 14 C ] - migalastat in the concentration range between 1 to 100 microM .
Elimination Metabolism : Based upon in vivo data , migalastat is a substrate for uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase ( UDPGT ) , a minor elimination pathway .
Excretion : In a mass balance study in healthy male subjects , following oral administration of 123 mg [ 14 C ] - migalastat , approximately 77 % of the total radiolabeled dose was recovered in urine and 20 % of the total radiolabeled dose was recovered in feces with an overall total recovery of 98 % within 96 hours post - dose .
In urine , unchanged migalastat accounted for 80 % of the radioactivity , which equates to 62 % of the administered dose .
In feces , unchanged migalastat was the only drug - related component .
In plasma , unchanged migalastat accounted for approximately 77 % of the plasma radioactivity and three dehydrogenated O - glucuronide conjugated metabolites , M1 to M3 , together accounted for approximately 13 % of the plasma radioactivity , none of which comprised more than 6 % of the radiolabeled dose .
Approximately 9 % of the total radioactivity in plasma was unassigned .
Following a single oral dose of 123 mg GALAFOLD , migalastat is cleared from plasma with a mean half - life ( t ½ ) of approximately 4 hours and apparent clearance of 12 . 5 L / hr .
Specific Populations Male and Female Patients : The pharmacokinetic characteristics of migalastat were not significantly different between healthy male and female subjects or patients with Fabry disease .
Racial or Ethnic Groups : Clinical data indicate no ethnic differences in patient populations studied with migalastat .
Patients with Renal Impairment : In a single - dose study in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment , exposure to migalastat ( AUC ) was increased by 1 . 2 - , 1 . 8 - , and 4 . 3 - fold in subjects with mild ( eGFR 60 to 90 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , moderate ( eGFR 30 to 59 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , and severe renal impairment ( eGFR less than 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , respectively , while the Cmax remained unchanged with severity of renal impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Drug Interaction Studies Migalastat is not a known inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P450 ( CYP450 ) enzymes , nor is it an inhibitor of BCRP , MDR1 , P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) , or BSEP human efflux transporters , or OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OAT1 , OAT3 , OCT1 , OCT2 , MATE1 , or MATE2 - K human uptake transporters .
Migalastat is not a substrate of P - gp , BCRP , MDR1 or MATE1 , MATE2 - K , OAT1 , OAT3 , or OCT2 .
Migalastat showed low affinity for SGLT1 , as both a substrate and an inhibitor , and showed no activity for SGLT2 .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis The carcinogenic potential of migalastat was assessed in a 2 - year study in rats and a 26 - week study in Tg . rasH2 mice .
In the 2 - year rat study , migalastat was not tumorigenic at oral doses of up to 600 mg / kg twice daily ( 24 times the recommended dose based on AUC ) .
In the 26 - week study in Tg . rasH2 mice , migalastat was not tumorigenic at oral doses of up to 1000 mg / kg / day in males and 500 mg / kg / day in females .
Mutagenesis Migalastat was negative in the bacterial mutagenicity ( Ames ) assay , in vitro cell mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma TK + / - cells , and in vivo micronucleus assay in rats .
Impairment of Fertility Oral administration of up to 12 . 5 mg / kg migalastat twice daily in rats ( equivalent to the human AUC at the recommended dose ) produced a significant decrease in male fertility .
This effect was completely reversed after four weeks of recovery .
Female fertility was not affected .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Study AT1001 - 011 ( referred to as Study 1 ; NCT00925301 ) included a 6 - month randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled phase followed by a 6 - month open - label treatment phase and a 12 - month open - label extension phase .
Patients received 123 mg GALAFOLD every other day taken without consuming food 2 hours before and 2 hours after each dose to give a minimum 4 hour fast [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
A total of 67 patients with Fabry disease who were naïve to GALAFOLD and enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) or were previously treated with ERT ( agalsidase beta or non - U . S . approved agalsidase alfa ) and had been off ERT for at least 6 months were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive either GALAFOLD 123 mg every other day or placebo for the first 6 months .
In the second 6 months , all patients were treated with GALAFOLD .
Results - Patients with Fabry Disease with Amenable GLA Variants Of the 67 enrolled patients , 50 patients ( 32 females , 18 males ) had amenable GLA variants based on the in vitro amenability assay [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
The median age of this population was 45 years and 97 % were Caucasian .
The major efficacy outcome measure of the average number of GL - 3 inclusions per kidney interstitial capillary ( KIC ) in renal biopsy samples was assessed by light microscopy before and after treatment .
Efficacy was evaluated after 6 months of treatment in 45 of 50 patients with amenable GLA variants ( 29 females and 16 males ) and with available histology data both at baseline and month 6 .
Of the 45 evaluable patients , 25 received GALAFOLD ( 18 females , 7 males ) and 20 received placebo ( 11 females , 9 males ) .
The proportion of patients with ≥ 50 % reduction from baseline in the average number of GL - 3 inclusions per KIC and the median changes from baseline in the average number of GL - 3 inclusions per KIC after 6 months of treatment in Study 1 are shown in Table 3 .
