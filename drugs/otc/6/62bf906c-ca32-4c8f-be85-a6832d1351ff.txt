UVA rays present almost the same damaging effects to the skin in December at 9 am , as they do in July at 4 pm .
UVA radiation is consistently damaging , and in fact , enters deeper into the skin than UVB .
Since UVA damage is cumulative and penetrates through glass , everyone requires daily , year round protection .
