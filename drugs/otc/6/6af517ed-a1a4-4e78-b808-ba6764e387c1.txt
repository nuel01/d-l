6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Safety of ELZONRIS was assessed in a single - arm clinical trial that included 122 adults with newly - diagnosed or relapsed / refractory myeloid malignancies , including 86 with BPDCN , treated with ELZONRIS 12 mcg / kg daily for 5 days of a 21 - day cycle .
The overall median number of cycles started was 2 . 5 ( range , 1 - 76 ) , and 4 in patients with BPDCN ( range , 1 - 76 ) .
Four ( 3 % ) patients ( 4 / 122 ) had fatal adverse reactions , all of which were related to capillary leak syndrome .
Overall , 8 % ( 10 / 122 ) of patients discontinued treatment with ELZONRIS due to an adverse reaction ; the most common adverse reactions resulting in treatment discontinuation were hepatic toxicities , hypoalbuminemia and CLS ( 2 % each ) .
Table 3 summarizes the common ( ≥ 10 % ) adverse reactions with ELZONRIS in patients with myeloid malignancies .
The rate of any given adverse reaction or lab abnormality was derived from all the reported events of that type .

There are no available data on ELZONRIS use in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes .
Animal reproduction or developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with tagraxofusp - erzs .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the US general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % , and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of ELZONRIS in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children from ELZONRIS , breast feeding is not recommended during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action , ELZONRIS may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing : Conduct pregnancy testing in females of reproductive potential within 7 days prior to initiating ELZONRIS treatment .
Contraception : Advise females to use acceptable contraceptive methods during ELZONRIS treatment and for 1 week after the last dose of ELZONRIS .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ELZONRIS for treatment of BPDCN have been established in pediatric patients 2 years of age and older ( no data for pediatric patients less than 2 years of age ) .
Use of ELZONRIS in these age groups is supported by evidence from an adequate and well - controlled study of ELZONRIS in adults with BPDCN and additional safety data from three pediatric patients with BPDCN , including 1 child ( 2 years to < 12 years old ) and 2 adolescents ( 12 years to < 17 years old ) , treated with ELZONRIS at the recommended dosage .
The safety profile of ELZONRIS in the pediatric patients was similar to that seen in the adults .
Efficacy for pediatric patients is extrapolated from the results of STML - 401 - 0114 [ see Clinical Studies 14 . 1 , 14 . 2 ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 86 patients who received ELZONRIS for BPDCN at the labeled dose in STML - 401 - 0114 , 63 % were 65 years and older and 22 % were 75 years and older .
Patients 75 years or older experienced a higher incidence of altered mental status ( including confusional state , delirium , mental status changes , dementia , and encephalopathy ) than patients under 75 years of age .
11 DESCRIPTION Tagraxofusp - erzs , a CD123 - directed cytotoxin , is a fusion protein comprised of a recombinant human interleukin - 3 ( IL - 3 ) and truncated diphtheria toxin ( DT ) .
Tagraxofusp - erzs has an approximate molecular weight of 57 , 695 Daltons .
Tagraxofusp - erzs is constructed by recombinant DNA technology and produced in Escherichia coli cells .
ELZONRIS ( tagraxofusp - erzs ) injection is a preservative - free , sterile , clear , colorless solution that may contain a few white to translucent particles and requires dilution prior to intravenous infusion .
ELZONRIS is supplied at a concentration of 1 , 000 mcg / mL in a single - dose vial .
Each mL of ELZONRIS contains 1 , 000 mcg tagraxofusp - erzs , sodium chloride ( 4 . 38 mg ) , sorbitol ( 50 mg ) , tromethamine ( 2 . 42 mg ) and Water for Injection , USP and pH is 7 . 5 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Tagraxofusp - erzs is a CD123 - directed cytotoxin composed of recombinant human interleukin - 3 ( IL - 3 ) and truncated diphtheria toxin ( DT ) fusion protein that inhibits protein synthesis and causes cell death in CD123 - expressing cells .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure - response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic response for ELZONRIS have not been fully characterized .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following administration of tagraxofusp - erzs 12 mcg / kg via 15 - minute infusion in patients with BPDCN , the mean ( SD ) area under the plasma drug concentration over time curve ( AUC ) was 231 ( 123 ) hr · mcg / L and maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) was 162 ( 58 . 1 ) mcg / L .
Distribution Mean ( SD ) volume of distribution of tagraxofusp - erzs is 5 . 1 ( 1 . 9 ) L in patients with BPDCN .
Elimination Mean ( SD ) clearance is 7 . 1 ( 7 . 2 ) L / hr in patients with BPDCN .
Mean ( SD ) terminal half - life of tagraxofusp - erzs is 0 . 7 ( 0 . 3 ) hours .
Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of tagraxofusp - erzs were observed based on age ( 22 to 84 years ) , sex , mild to moderate renal impairment ( eGFR 30 to 89 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 , estimated by MDRD ) , mild ( total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN , or total bilirubin 1 to 1 . 5 times ULN and any AST ) or moderate ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 to 3 times ULN and any AST ) hepatic impairment or body weight after adjusting dose by body weight .
The effect of severe renal impairment ( eGFR 15 to 29 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , or severe hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 3 times ULN and any AST ) on tagraxofusp - erzs pharmacokinetics is unknown .
Drug Interaction Studies No drug - drug interaction studies have been conducted with ELZONRIS .
12 . 6 Immunogenicity The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies to ELZONRIS with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading .
Immune response to ELZONRIS was evaluated by assessment of serum binding reactivity against ELZONRIS ( anti - drug antibodies ; ADA ) and neutralizing antibodies by inhibition of functional activity .
Immune response to ELZONRIS was assessed using two immunoassays .
The first assay detected reactivity directed against ELZONRIS ( ADA ) , and the second assay detected reactivity against the interleukin - 3 ( IL - 3 ) portion of ELZONRIS .
Two cell - based assays were used to investigate the presence of neutralizing antibodies by inhibition of a cell - based functional activity .
In 130 patients treated with ELZONRIS in 4 clinical trials : • 96 % ( 115 / 120 ) of patients evaluable for the presence of pre - existing ADA at baseline before treatment were confirmed positive with 21 % being positive for the presence of neutralizing antibodies .
The high prevalence of ADA at baseline was anticipated due to diphtheria immunization .
• 99 % ( 107 / 108 ) of patients evaluable for treatment - emergent ADA tested positive with most patients showing an increase in ADA titer by the end of Cycle 2 of ELZONRIS .
• 85 % ( 86 / 101 ) of ADA - positive patients evaluable for the presence of neutralizing antibodies were neutralizing antibody - positive .
• 68 % ( 73 / 108 ) of patients evaluable for treatment - emergent anti - IL - 3 antibodies tested positive with most patients testing positive by Cycle 3 of ELZONRIS .
Anti - Product Antibody Effects on Pharmacokinetics The presence of ADA had a clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of tagraxofusp - erzs .
Pharmacokinetic data obtained following doses given in Cycle 3 showed increased titers of anti - drug antibodies and reduced free ELZONRIS concentration in most plasma samples .
Following administration of tagraxofusp - erzs 12 mcg / kg via 15 - minute infusion in patients with pre - existing anti - drug antibodies , the mean ( SD ) volume of distribution of tagraxofusp - erzs is 21 . 2 ( 25 . 4 ) L , clearance is 13 . 9 ( 19 . 4 ) L / hr , AUC is 151 ( 89 . 2 ) hr · mcg / L and Cmax is 80 . 0 ( 82 . 2 ) mcg / L .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No studies have been conducted to assess the carcinogenic or genotoxic potential of tagraxofusp .
Animal fertility studies have not been conducted with tagraxofusp - erzs .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology At human equivalent doses greater than or equal to 1 . 6 times the recommended dose based on body surface area , severe kidney tubular degeneration / necrosis was observed in cynomolgus monkeys .
At human equivalent doses equal to the recommended dose , degeneration / necrosis of the choroid plexus in the brain was observed in cynomolgus monkeys .
The reversibility of this finding was not assessed at lower doses , but the finding was irreversible and became progressively more severe at a human equivalent dose 1 . 6 times the recommended dose , 3 weeks after dosing stopped .
