Known hypersensitivity to dupilumab or any excipients in DUPIXENT .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypersensitivity : Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis , serum sickness , angioedema , urticaria , rash , erythema nodosum , and erythema multiforme have occurred .
Discontinue DUPIXENT in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction .
( 5 . 1 ) • Conjunctivitis and Keratitis : Advise patients to report new onset or worsening eye symptoms to their healthcare provider .
Consider ophthalmological examination , as appropriate .
( 5 . 2 ) • Eosinophilic Conditions : Be alert to vasculitic rash , worsening pulmonary symptoms , and / or neuropathy , especially upon reduction of oral corticosteroids .
( 5 . 3 ) • Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage : Do not discontinue systemic , topical , or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of DUPIXENT .
Decrease steroids gradually , if appropriate .
( 5 . 5 ) • Arthralgia : Advise patients to report new onset or worsening joint symptoms to their healthcare provider .
If symptoms persist or worsen , consider rheumatological evaluation and / or discontinuation of DUPIXENT .
( 5 . 7 ) • Parasitic ( Helminth ) Infections : Treat pre - existing helminth infections before initiating DUPIXENT .
If patients become infected while receiving DUPIXENT and do not respond to anti - helminth treatment , discontinue DUPIXENT until the infection resolves .
( 5 . 8 ) • Vaccinations : Avoid use of live vaccines .
( 5 . 9 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis , serum sickness or serum sickness - like reactions , angioedema , generalized urticaria , rash , erythema nodosum , and erythema multiforme have been reported .
If a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs , institute appropriate therapy and discontinue DUPIXENT [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 , 6 . 2 , 6 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 2 Conjunctivitis and Keratitis Conjunctivitis and keratitis adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials .
Conjunctivitis and keratitis occurred more frequently in AD subjects who received DUPIXENT compared to those who received placebo .
Conjunctivitis was the most frequently reported eye disorder .
Most subjects with conjunctivitis or keratitis recovered or were recovering during the treatment period [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In subjects with CRSwNP , the frequency of conjunctivitis was 2 % in the DUPIXENT group compared to 1 % in the placebo group in the 24 - week safety pool ; these subjects recovered .
There were no cases of keratitis reported in the CRSwNP development program [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Among subjects with asthma , the frequencies of conjunctivitis and keratitis were similar between DUPIXENT and placebo [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Among subjects with EoE , the frequency of conjunctivitis and keratitis was 0 % and 0 % in the DUPIXENT group and 2 % and 0 % in the placebo group , respectively [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In subjects with PN , the frequency of conjunctivitis was 4 % in the DUPIXENT group compared to 1 % in the placebo group ; these subjects recovered or were recovering during the treatment period .
There were no cases of keratitis reported in the PN development program [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Conjunctivitis and keratitis adverse events have also been reported with DUPIXENT in postmarketing settings , predominantly in AD patients .
Some patients reported visual disturbances ( e . g . , blurred vision ) associated with conjunctivitis or keratitis .
Advise patients to report new onset or worsening eye symptoms to their healthcare provider .
Consider ophthalmological examination for patients who develop conjunctivitis that does not resolve following standard treatment or signs and symptoms suggestive of keratitis , as appropriate [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 3 Eosinophilic Conditions Patients being treated for asthma may present with serious systemic eosinophilia sometimes presenting with clinical features of eosinophilic pneumonia or vasculitis consistent with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis , conditions which are often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy .
These events may be associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy .
Healthcare providers should be alert to vasculitic rash , worsening pulmonary symptoms , cardiac complications , and / or neuropathy presenting in their patients with eosinophilia .
Cases of eosinophilic pneumonia were reported in adult subjects who participated in the asthma development program and cases of vasculitis consistent with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis have been reported with DUPIXENT in adult subjects who participated in the asthma development program as well as in adult subjects with co - morbid asthma in the CRSwNP development program .
A causal association between DUPIXENT and these conditions has not been established .
5 . 4 Acute Asthma Symptoms or Deteriorating Disease DUPIXENT should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms or acute exacerbations .
Do not use DUPIXENT to treat acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus .
Patients should seek medical advice if their asthma remains uncontrolled or worsens after initiation of treatment with DUPIXENT .
5 . 5 Risk Associated with Abrupt Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage Do not discontinue systemic , topical , or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with DUPIXENT .
Reductions in corticosteroid dose , if appropriate , should be gradual and performed under the direct supervision of a healthcare provider .
Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and / or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy .
5 . 6 Patients with Co - morbid Asthma Advise patients with co - morbid asthma not to adjust or stop their asthma treatments without consultation with their physicians .
5 . 7 Arthralgia Arthralgia has been reported with the use of DUPIXENT with some patients reporting gait disturbances or decreased mobility associated with joint symptoms ; some cases resulted in hospitalization [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In postmarketing reports , onset of arthralgia was variable , ranging from days to months after the first dose of DUPIXENT .
Some patients ' symptoms resolved while continuing treatment with DUPIXENT and other patients recovered or were recovering following discontinuation of DUPIXENT .
Advise patients to report new onset or worsening joint symptoms to their healthcare provider .
If symptoms persist or worsen , consider rheumatological evaluation and / or discontinuation of DUPIXENT .
5 . 8 Parasitic ( Helminth ) Infections Patients with known helminth infections were excluded from participation in clinical studies .
It is unknown if DUPIXENT will influence the immune response against helminth infections .
Treat patients with pre - existing helminth infections before initiating therapy with DUPIXENT .
If patients become infected while receiving treatment with DUPIXENT and do not respond to anti - helminth treatment , discontinue treatment with DUPIXENT until the infection resolves .
Adverse reactions of helminth infections ( 5 cases of enterobiasis and 1 case of ascariasis ) were reported in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years old who participated in the pediatric asthma development program [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 9 Vaccinations Consider completing all age - appropriate vaccinations as recommended by current immunization guidelines prior to initiating treatment with DUPIXENT .
Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with DUPIXENT .
It is unknown if administration of live vaccines during DUPIXENT treatment will impact the safety or effectiveness of these vaccines .
Limited data are available regarding coadministration of DUPIXENT with non - live vaccines [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Adults with Atopic Dermatitis Three randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , multicenter trials ( SOLO 1 , SOLO 2 , and CHRONOS ) and one dose - ranging trial ( AD - 1021 ) evaluated the safety of DUPIXENT in subjects with moderate - to - severe AD .
The safety population had a mean age of 38 years ; 41 % of subjects were female , 67 % were White , 24 % were Asian , and 6 % were Black ; in terms of co - morbid conditions , 48 % of the subjects had asthma , 49 % had allergic rhinitis , 37 % had food allergy , and 27 % had allergic conjunctivitis .
In these 4 trials , 1472 subjects were treated with subcutaneous injections of DUPIXENT , with or without concomitant topical corticosteroids ( TCS ) .
A total of 739 subjects were treated with DUPIXENT for at least 1 year in the development program for moderate - to - severe AD .
SOLO 1 , SOLO 2 , and AD - 1021 compared the safety of DUPIXENT monotherapy to placebo through Week 16 .
CHRONOS compared the safety of DUPIXENT + TCS to placebo + TCS through Week 52 .
AD - 1225 is a multicenter , open - label extension ( OLE ) study which assessed the long - term safety of repeat doses of DUPIXENT ( through 148 weeks of treatment ) in adults with moderate - to - severe AD who had previously participated in controlled studies of DUPIXENT or had been screened for SOLO 1 or SOLO 2 .
The safety data in AD - 1225 reflect exposure to DUPIXENT in 2677 subjects , including 2254 exposed for at least 52 weeks , 1192 exposed for at least 100 weeks , and 357 exposed for at least 148 weeks .
In AD - 1225 , 99 . 7 % of subjects were exposed to DUPIXENT 300 mg weekly dosing ( QW ) .
Weeks 0 to 16 ( SOLO 1 , SOLO 2 , CHRONOS , and AD - 1021 ) In DUPIXENT monotherapy trials ( SOLO 1 , SOLO 2 , and AD - 1021 ) through Week 16 , the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment because of adverse events was 1 . 9 % in both the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W and placebo groups .
Table 5 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1 % in the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W monotherapy groups , and in the DUPIXENT + TCS group , all at a higher rate than in their respective comparator groups during the first 16 weeks of treatment .

Asthma Adults and Pediatric Subjects 12 Years of Age and Older with Asthma A total of 2888 adult and pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with moderate - to - severe asthma ( AS ) were evaluated in 3 randomized , placebo - controlled , multicenter trials of 24 to 52 weeks duration ( DRI12544 , QUEST , and VENTURE ) .
Of these , 2678 had a history of 1 or more severe exacerbations in the year prior to enrollment despite regular use of medium to high - dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional controller ( s ) ( DRI12544 and QUEST ) .
A total of 210 subjects with oral corticosteroid - dependent asthma receiving high - dose inhaled corticosteroids plus up to two additional controllers were enrolled ( VENTURE ) .
The safety population ( DRI12544 and QUEST ) was 12 - 87 years of age , of which 63 % were female , and 82 % were White .
DUPIXENT 200 mg or 300 mg was administered subcutaneously Q2W , following an initial dose of 400 mg or 600 mg , respectively .
In DRI12544 and QUEST , the proportion of subjects who discontinued treatment due to adverse events was 4 % of the placebo group , 3 % of the DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W group , and 6 % of the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W group .
Table 6 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1 % in subjects treated with DUPIXENT and at a higher rate than in their respective comparator groups in DRI12544 and QUEST .

Injection site reactions were most common with the loading ( initial ) dose .
The safety profile of DUPIXENT through Week 52 was generally consistent with the safety profile observed at Week 24 .
Pediatric Subjects 6 to 11 Years of Age with Asthma The safety of DUPIXENT was assessed in 405 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age with moderate - to - severe asthma ( VOYAGE ) .
The safety profile of DUPIXENT in these subjects through Week 52 was similar to the safety profile from studies in adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with moderate - to - severe asthma with the addition of helminth infections .
Helminth infections were reported in 2 . 2 % ( 6 subjects ) in the DUPIXENT group and 0 . 7 % ( 1 subject ) in the placebo group .
The majority of cases were enterobiasis , reported in 1 . 8 % ( 5 subjects ) in the DUPIXENT group and none in the placebo group .

These included anaphylaxis , serum sickness or serum sickness - like reactions , generalized urticaria , rash , erythema nodosum , and erythema multiforme [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Eosinophils DUPIXENT - treated subjects with AD , asthma , and CRSwNP had a greater initial increase from baseline in blood eosinophil count compared to subjects treated with placebo .
An increase from baseline in blood eosinophil count was not observed in subjects with EoE treated with DUPIXENT as compared to placebo .
In adult subjects with AD ( SOLO 1 , SOLO 2 , and AD - 1021 ) , the mean and median increases in blood eosinophils from baseline to Week 4 were 100 and 0 cells / mcL , respectively .
In pediatric subjects < 6 years old with AD , the mean and median increases from baseline to week 4 were 478 and 90 cells / mcL , respectively .

In the trials for the PN indication , the incidence of treatment - emergent eosinophilia ( ≥ 500 cells / mcL ) was lower in DUPIXENT than in the placebo group .
Treatment - emergent eosinophilia ( ≥ 5 , 000 cells / mcL ) was reported in < 3 % of DUPIXENT - treated subjects and < 0 . 5 % in placebo - treated subjects ( SOLO 1 , SOLO 2 , and AD - 1021 ; DRI12544 , QUEST , and VOYAGE ; SINUS - 24 and SINUS - 52 ; PRIME and PRIME2 ) .
Blood eosinophil counts declined to near baseline or remained below baseline levels ( PRIME and PRIME2 ) during study treatment .
In study AD - 1539 , treatment - emergent eosinophilia ( ≥ 5 , 000 cells / mcL ) was reported in 8 % of DUPIXENT - treated subjects and 0 % in placebo - treated subjects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Cardiovascular In the 1 - year placebo - controlled trial in adult and pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older with asthma ( QUEST ) , cardiovascular thromboembolic events ( cardiovascular deaths , non - fatal myocardial infarctions , and non - fatal strokes ) were reported in 1 ( 0 . 2 % ) of the DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W group , 4 ( 0 . 6 % ) of the DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W group , and 2 ( 0 . 3 % ) of the placebo group .
In the 1 - year placebo - controlled trial in subjects with AD ( CHRONOS ) , cardiovascular thromboembolic events ( cardiovascular deaths , non - fatal myocardial infarctions , and non - fatal strokes ) were reported in 1 ( 0 . 9 % ) of the DUPIXENT + TCS 300 mg Q2W group , 0 ( 0 . 0 % ) of the DUPIXENT + TCS 300 mg QW group , and 1 ( 0 . 3 % ) of the placebo + TCS group .
In the 24 - week placebo - controlled trial in subjects with CRSwNP ( SINUS - 24 ) , cardiovascular thromboembolic events ( cardiovascular deaths , non - fatal myocardial infarctions , and non - fatal strokes ) were reported in 1 ( 0 . 7 % ) of the DUPIXENT group and 0 ( 0 . 0 % ) of the placebo group .
In the 1 - year placebo - controlled trial in subjects with CRSwNP ( SINUS - 52 ) , there were no cases of cardiovascular thromboembolic events ( cardiovascular deaths , non - fatal myocardial infarctions , and non - fatal strokes ) reported in any treatment arm .
In the 24 - week placebo - controlled trial in subjects with EoE ( Parts A and B ) , there were no cases of cardiovascular thromboembolic events ( cardiovascular deaths , non - fatal myocardial infarctions , and non - fatal strokes ) reported in any treatment arm .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is a potential for immunogenicity .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors , including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies to dupilumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading .
Atopic Dermatitis Approximately 6 % of subjects with AD who received DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W for 52 weeks developed antibodies to DUPIXENT ; approximately 2 % exhibited persistent ADA responses , and approximately 1 % had neutralizing antibodies .
Similar results were observed in pediatric subjects 6 months to 11 years of age with AD who received either DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W , 200 mg Q4W , or 300 mg Q4W .
Approximately 16 % of pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with AD who received DUPIXENT 300 mg or 200 mg Q2W for 16 weeks developed antibodies to DUPIXENT ; approximately 3 % exhibited persistent ADA responses , and approximately 5 % had neutralizing antibodies .
Asthma Approximately 5 % of subjects with asthma who received DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W for 52 weeks developed antibodies to DUPIXENT ; approximately 2 % exhibited persistent ADA responses , and approximately 2 % had neutralizing antibodies .
Similar results were observed in pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age with asthma who received either DUPIXENT 100 mg Q2W or 200 mg Q2W up to 52 weeks .
Approximately 9 % of subjects with asthma who received DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W for 52 weeks developed antibodies to DUPIXENT ; approximately 4 % exhibited persistent ADA responses , and approximately 4 % had neutralizing antibodies .
Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyposis Approximately 5 % of subjects with CRSwNP who received DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W for 52 weeks developed antibodies to DUPIXENT ; approximately 2 % exhibited persistent ADA responses , and approximately 3 % had neutralizing antibodies .
Eosinophilic Esophagitis Approximately 1 % of subjects with EoE who received DUPIXENT 300 mg QW for 24 weeks developed antibodies to DUPIXENT .
Prurigo Nodularis Approximately 8 % of subjects with PN who received DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W for 24 weeks developed antibodies to DUPIXENT ; approximately 1 % exhibited persistent ADA responses , and approximately 3 % had neutralizing antibodies .
The antibody titers detected in subjects who received DUPIXENT were mostly low .
In subjects who received DUPIXENT , development of high titer antibodies to DUPIXENT was associated with lower serum dupilumab concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Two adult subjects with AD who experienced high titer antibody responses developed serum sickness or serum sickness - like reactions during DUPIXENT therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of DUPIXENT .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Immune system disorders : angioedema [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Facial skin reactions , including erythema , rash , scaling , edema , papules , pruritus , burning , and pain 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to DUPIXENT during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers and patients may call 1 - 877 - 311 - 8972 or go to https : / / mothertobaby . org / ongoing - study / dupixent / to enroll in or to obtain information about the registry .
Risk Summary Available data from case reports and case series with DUPIXENT use in pregnant women have not identified a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Human IgG antibodies are known to cross the placental barrier ; therefore , DUPIXENT may be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus .
There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with asthma in pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
In an enhanced pre - and post - natal developmental study , no adverse developmental effects were observed in offspring born to pregnant monkeys after subcutaneous administration of a homologous antibody against interleukin - 4 - receptor alpha ( IL - 4Rα ) during organogenesis through parturition at doses up to 10 - times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) ( see Data ) .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - Associated Maternal and / or Embryo - fetal Risk In women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma , evidence demonstrates that there is an increased risk of preeclampsia in the mother and prematurity , low birth weight , and small for gestational age in the neonate .
The level of asthma control should be closely monitored in pregnant women and treatment adjusted as necessary to maintain optimal control .
Data Animal Data In an enhanced pre - and post - natal development toxicity study , pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered weekly subcutaneous doses of homologous antibody against IL - 4Rα up to 10 times the MRHD ( on a mg / kg basis of 100 mg / kg / week ) from the beginning of organogenesis to parturition .
No treatment - related adverse effects on embryo - fetal toxicity or malformations , or on morphological , functional , or immunological development were observed in the infants from birth through 6 months of age .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of dupilumab in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk .
The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure to dupilumab on the breastfed infant are unknown .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for DUPIXENT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from DUPIXENT or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Atopic Dermatitis The safety and effectiveness of DUPIXENT have been established in pediatric patients 6 months of age and older with moderate - to - severe AD [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
Use of DUPIXENT in this age group is supported by data from the following clinical trials : • AD - 1526 which included 251 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with moderate - to - severe AD treated with DUPIXENT • AD - 1652 which included 367 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age with severe AD treated with DUPIXENT + TCS • AD - 1539 which included 161 pediatric subjects 6 months to 5 years of age with moderate - to - severe AD treated with DUPIXENT + TCS • AD - 1434 , an open - label extension study that enrolled 275 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age treated with DUPIXENT , 368 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age treated with DUPIXENT ± TCS , and 180 pediatric subjects 6 months to 5 years of age treated with DUPIXENT ± TCS The safety and effectiveness were generally consistent between pediatric and adult patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
In addition , hand - foot - and - mouth disease was reported in 9 ( 5 % ) pediatric subjects and skin papilloma was reported in 4 ( 2 % ) pediatric subjects 6 months to 5 years of age treated with DUPIXENT ± TCS in AD - 1434 .
These cases did not lead to study drug discontinuation .
[ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 6 months of age with AD have not been established .
Asthma The safety and effectiveness of DUPIXENT for an add - on maintenance treatment in patients with moderate - to - severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma have been established in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older .
Use of DUPIXENT for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies in adult and pediatric patients 6 years and older [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Pediatric Subjects 12 to 17 Years of Age : A total of 107 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with moderate - to - severe asthma were enrolled in QUEST and received either 200 mg ( N = 21 ) or 300 mg ( N = 18 ) DUPIXENT ( or matching placebo either 200 mg [ N = 34 ] or 300 mg [ N = 34 ] ) Q2W .
Asthma exacerbations and lung function were assessed in both pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age and adults .
For both the 200 mg and 300 mg Q2W doses , improvements in FEV1 ( LS mean change from baseline at Week 12 ) were observed ( 0 . 36 L and 0 . 27 L , respectively ) .
For the 200 mg Q2W dose , subjects had a reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations that was consistent with adults .
Dupilumab exposure was higher in pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age than that in adults at the respective dose level which was mainly accounted for by difference in body weight [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The adverse event profile in pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age was generally similar to the adults [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Pediatric Subjects 6 to 11 Years of Age : A total of 408 pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age with moderate - to - severe asthma were enrolled in VOYAGE , which evaluated doses of 100 mg Q2W or 200 mg Q2W .
Improvement in asthma exacerbations and lung function were demonstrated [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The effectiveness of DUPIXENT 300 mg Q4W in subjects 6 to 11 years of age with body weight 15 to < 30 kg was extrapolated from efficacy of 100 mg Q2W in VOYAGE with support from population pharmacokinetic analyses showing higher drug exposure levels with 300 mg Q4W [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Subjects who completed the treatment period of the VOYAGE study could participate in the open - label extension study ( LTS14424 ) .
Eighteen subjects ( ≥ 15 to < 30 kg ) out of 365 subjects were exposed to 300 mg Q4W in this study , and the safety profile in these eighteen subjects was consistent with that seen in VOYAGE .
Additional safety for DUPIXENT 300 mg Q4W is based upon available safety information from the pediatric AD indication [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age with asthma have not been established .
CRSwNP Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age with CRSwNP have not been established .
EoE The safety and effectiveness of DUPIXENT for the treatment of EoE have been established in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older , weighing at least 40 kg .
Use of DUPIXENT in this population is supported by an adequate and well - controlled study in adults ( Parts A and B ) which included 72 pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age , weighing at least 40 kg , and additional pharmacokinetic data .
The safety and effectiveness in adults and pediatric patients were similar [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of DUPIXENT for the treatment of EoE in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age and weighing less than 40 kg have not been established .
Prurigo Nodularis Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 18 years of age with PN have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 1472 subjects with AD exposed to DUPIXENT in a dose - ranging study and placebo - controlled trials , 67 subjects were 65 years or older .
Clinical trials of DUPIXENT in AD did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Of the 1977 subjects with asthma exposed to DUPIXENT , a total of 240 subjects were 65 years or older .
Efficacy and safety in this age group was similar to the overall study population .
Of the 440 subjects with CRSwNP exposed to DUPIXENT , a total of 79 subjects were 65 years or older .
Efficacy and safety in this age group were similar to the overall study population .
Clinical studies of DUPIXENT in EoE did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult subjects .
Of the 152 subjects with PN exposed to DUPIXENT , a total of 37 were 65 years or older including 8 subjects 75 years or older .
Clinical trials did not include a sufficient number of subjects 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult subjects .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no specific treatment for DUPIXENT overdose .

11 DESCRIPTION Dupilumab , an interleukin - 4 receptor alpha antagonist , is a human monoclonal antibody of the IgG4 subclass that binds to the IL - 4Rα subunit and inhibits IL - 4 and IL - 13 signaling .
Dupilumab has an approximate molecular weight of 147 kDa .
Dupilumab is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary cell suspension culture .
DUPIXENT ( dupilumab ) Injection is supplied as a sterile , preservative - free , clear to slightly opalescent , colorless to pale yellow solution for subcutaneous injection .
DUPIXENT is provided as either a single - dose pre - filled syringe with needle shield or a single - dose pre - filled pen in a siliconized Type - 1 clear glass syringe .
The needle cap is not made with natural rubber latex .
Each 300 mg pre - filled syringe or pre - filled pen delivers 300 mg dupilumab in 2 mL which also contains L - arginine hydrochloride ( 10 . 5 mg ) , L - histidine ( 6 . 2 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 4 mg ) , sodium acetate ( 2 mg ) , sucrose ( 100 mg ) , and water for injection , pH 5 . 9 .
Each 200 mg pre - filled syringe or pre - filled pen delivers 200 mg dupilumab in 1 . 14 mL which also contains L - arginine hydrochloride ( 12 mg ) , L - histidine ( 3 . 5 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 2 . 3 mg ) , sodium acetate ( 1 . 2 mg ) , sucrose ( 57 mg ) , and water for injection , pH 5 . 9 .
Each 100 mg pre - filled syringe delivers 100 mg dupilumab in 0 . 67 mL which also contains L - arginine hydrochloride ( 3 . 5 mg ) , L - histidine ( 2 . 1 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 1 . 3 mg ) , sodium acetate ( 0 . 7 mg ) , sucrose ( 34 mg ) , and water for injection , pH 5 . 9 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Dupilumab is a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody that inhibits interleukin - 4 ( IL - 4 ) and interleukin - 13 ( IL - 13 ) signaling by specifically binding to the IL - 4Rα subunit shared by the IL - 4 and IL - 13 receptor complexes .
Dupilumab inhibits IL - 4 signaling via the Type I receptor and both IL - 4 and IL - 13 signaling through the Type II receptor .
Inflammation driven by IL - 4 and IL - 13 is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma , AD , CRSwNP , EoE , and PN .
Multiple cell types that express IL - 4Rα ( e . g . , mast cells , eosinophils , macrophages , lymphocytes , epithelial cells , goblet cells ) and inflammatory mediators ( e . g . , histamine , eicosanoids , leukotrienes , cytokines , chemokines ) are involved in inflammation .
Blocking IL - 4Rα with dupilumab inhibits IL - 4 and IL - 13 cytokine - induced inflammatory responses , including the release of proinflammatory cytokines , chemokines , nitric oxide , and IgE .
The mechanism of dupilumab action has not been definitively established .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Consistent with inhibition of IL - 4 and IL - 13 signaling , dupilumab treatment decreased certain biomarkers of inflammation .
In asthma subjects , fractional exhaled nitric oxide ( FeNO ) and circulating concentrations of eotaxin - 3 , total IgE , allergen specific IgE , TARC , and periostin were decreased relative to placebo .
Reductions in these biomarkers were comparable for the 300 mg Q2W and 200 mg Q2W regimens .
These markers were near maximal suppression after 2 weeks of treatment , except for IgE which declined more slowly .
These effects were sustained throughout treatment .
The median percent reduction from baseline in total IgE concentrations with dupilumab treatments was 52 % at Week 24 ( DRI12544 ) and 70 % at Week 52 ( QUEST ) .
For FeNO , the mean percent reduction from baseline at Week 2 was 35 % and 24 % in DRI12544 and QUEST , respectively , and in the overall safety population , the mean FeNO level decreased to 20 ppb .
Antibody Response to Non - Live Vaccines During DUPIXENT Treatment In a clinical study , adult subjects with AD were treated once weekly for 16 weeks with 300 mg of DUPIXENT ( twice the recommended dosing frequency ) .
After 12 weeks of administration , subjects received a Tdap vaccine and a meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine .
Antibody responses to tetanus toxoid and serogroup C meningococcal polysaccharide were assessed 4 weeks later .
Antibody responses to both tetanus toxoid and serogroup C meningococcal polysaccharide were similar in DUPIXENT - treated and placebo - treated subjects .
Antibody responses to the other active components of both vaccines were not assessed .
Antibody responses to other non - live vaccines were also not assessed .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of dupilumab is similar in subjects with AD , asthma , CRSwNP , EoE and PN .
Absorption Following an initial subcutaneous ( SC ) dose of 600 mg , 400 mg , or 300 mg , dupilumab reached peak mean ± SD concentrations ( Cmax ) of 70 . 1 ± 24 . 1 mcg / mL , 41 . 8 ± 12 . 4 mcg / mL , or 30 . 5 ± 9 . 39 mcg / mL , respectively , by approximately 1 week post dose .
Steady - state concentrations were achieved by Week 16 following the administration of 600 mg starting dose and 300 mg dose either weekly or Q2W , or 400 mg starting dose and 200 mg dose Q2W , or 300 mg Q2W without a loading dose .
Across clinical trials , the mean ± SD steady - state trough concentrations ranged from 60 . 3 ± 35 . 1 mcg / mL to 80 . 2 ± 35 . 3 mcg / mL for 300 mg administered Q2W , from 173 ± 75 . 9 mcg / mL to 195 ± 71 . 7 mcg / mL for 300 mg administered weekly , and from 29 . 2 ± 18 . 7 to 36 . 5 ± 22 . 2 mg / L for 200 mg administered Q2W .
The bioavailability of dupilumab following a SC dose is similar between AD , asthma , CRSwNP , EoE , and PN subjects , ranging between 61 % and 64 % .
Distribution The estimated total volume of distribution was approximately 4 . 8 ± 1 . 3 L . Elimination The metabolic pathway of dupilumab has not been characterized .
As a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody , dupilumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG .
After the last steady - state dose of 300 mg QW , 300 mg Q2W , 200 mg Q2W , 300 mg Q4W , or 200 mg Q4W dupilumab , the median times to non - detectable concentration ( < 78 ng / mL ) ranged from 9 to 13 weeks in adults and pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age .
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate the median times to non - detectable concentration are approximately 1 . 5 times ( up to 19 weeks ) and 2 . 5 times ( up to 32 weeks ) longer in pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age and pediatric subjects 6 months to 5 years of age , respectively .
Dose Linearity Dupilumab exhibited nonlinear target - mediated pharmacokinetics with exposures increasing in a greater than dose - proportional manner .
The systemic exposure increased by 30 - fold when the dose increased 8 - fold following a single dose of dupilumab from 75 mg to 600 mg ( i . e . , 0 . 25 - times to 2 - times the recommended dose ) .
Weight Dupilumab trough concentrations were lower in subjects with higher body weight .
Age Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis , age did not affect dupilumab clearance in adults and in pediatric subjects 6 to 17 years of age .
In pediatric subjects 6 months to 5 years of age , clearance increased with age .
Immunogenicity Development of antibodies to dupilumab was associated with lower serum dupilumab concentrations .
A few subjects who had high antibody titers also had no detectable serum dupilumab concentrations .
Specific Populations Geriatric Patients In subjects who are 65 years and older , the mean ± SD steady - state trough concentrations of dupilumab were 69 . 4 ± 31 . 4 mcg / mL and 166 ± 62 . 3 mcg / mL , respectively , for 300 mg administered Q2W and weekly , and 39 . 7 ± 21 . 7 mcg / mL for 200 mg administered Q2W .
Pediatric Patients Atopic Dermatitis For pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with AD receiving every other week dosing ( Q2W ) with either 200 mg ( < 60 kg ) or 300 mg ( ≥ 60 kg ) , the mean ± SD steady - state trough concentration of dupilumab was 54 . 5 ± 27 . 0 mcg / mL .
For pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age with AD receiving every other week dosing ( Q2W ) with 200 mg ( ≥ 30 kg ) or every four week dosing ( Q4W ) with 300 mg ( < 30 kg ) , mean ± SD steady - state trough concentration was 86 . 0 ± 34 . 6 mcg / mL and 98 . 7 ± 33 . 2 mcg / mL , respectively .
For pediatric subjects 6 months to 5 years of age with AD receiving every four week dosing ( Q4W ) with 300 mg ( ≥ 15 to < 30 kg ) or 200 mg ( ≥ 5 to < 15 kg ) , the mean ± SD steady - state trough concentration was 110 ± 42 . 8 mcg / mL and 109 ± 50 . 8 mcg / mL , respectively .
Asthma A total of 107 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age with asthma were enrolled in QUEST .
The mean ± SD steady - state trough concentrations of dupilumab were 107 ± 51 . 6 mcg / mL and 46 . 7 ± 26 . 9 mcg / mL , respectively , for 300 mg or 200 mg administered Q2W .
In VOYAGE , dupilumab pharmacokinetics was investigated in 270 subjects with moderate - to - severe asthma following subcutaneous administration of either 100 mg Q2W ( for 91 pediatric subjects weighing < 30 kg ) or 200 mg Q2W ( for 179 pediatric subjects weighing ≥ 30 kg ) .
The mean ± SD steady - state trough concentration was 58 . 4 ± 28 . 0 mcg / mL and 85 . 1 ± 44 . 9 mcg / mL , respectively .
Simulation of a 300 mg Q4W subcutaneous dose in pediatric subjects 6 to 11 years of age with body weight of ≥ 15 to < 30 kg resulted in predicted steady - state trough concentrations ( 98 . 7 ± 41 . 0 mcg / L ) and average concentrations higher than the observed trough concentrations and average concentrations of 100 mg Q2W ( < 30 kg ) .
Eosinophilic Esophagitis In a clinical study ( Parts A and B ) , dupilumab pharmacokinetics were investigated in 35 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age , weighing at least 40 kg , with EoE , receiving 300 mg QW .
The mean ± SD steady - state trough concentration of dupilumab was 227 ± 95 . 3 mcg / mL .
Drug Interaction Studies An effect of dupilumab on the PK of co - administered medications is not expected .
Based on the population analysis , commonly co - administered medications had no effect on DUPIXENT pharmacokinetics in subjects with moderate - to - severe asthma .
Cytochrome P450 Substrates The effects of dupilumab on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam ( metabolized by CYP3A4 ) , warfarin ( metabolized by CYP2C9 ) , omeprazole ( metabolized by CYP2C19 ) , metoprolol ( metabolized by CYP2D6 ) , and caffeine ( metabolized by CYP1A2 ) were evaluated in a study with 12 - 13 evaluable subjects with AD ( a SC loading dose of 600 mg followed by 300 mg SC weekly for six weeks ) .
No clinically significant changes in AUC were observed .
The largest effect was observed for metoprolol ( CYP2D6 ) with an increase in AUC of 29 % .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of dupilumab .
No effects on fertility parameters such as reproductive organs , menstrual cycle length , or sperm analysis were observed in sexually mature mice that were subcutaneously administered a homologous antibody against IL - 4Rα at doses up to 200 mg / kg / week .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Atopic Dermatitis Adults with Atopic Dermatitis Three randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials ( SOLO 1 ( NCT02277743 ) , SOLO 2 ( NCT02277769 ) , and CHRONOS ( NCT02260986 ) ) enrolled a total of 2119 adult subjects 18 years of age and older with moderate - to - severe AD not adequately controlled by topical medication ( s ) .
Disease severity was defined by an Investigator ' s Global Assessment ( IGA ) score ≥ 3 in the overall assessment of AD lesions on a severity scale of 0 to 4 , an Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI ) score ≥ 16 on a scale of 0 to 72 , and a minimum body surface area involvement of ≥ 10 % .
At baseline , 59 % of subjects were male , 67 % were White , 52 % of subjects had a baseline IGA score of 3 ( moderate AD ) , and 48 % of subjects had a baseline IGA of 4 ( severe AD ) .
The baseline mean EASI score was 33 and the baseline weekly averaged Peak Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) was 7 on a scale of 0 - 10 .
In all three trials , subjects in the DUPIXENT group received subcutaneous injections of DUPIXENT 600 mg at Week 0 , followed by 300 mg every other week ( Q2W ) .
In the monotherapy trials ( SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 ) , subjects received DUPIXENT or placebo for 16 weeks .
In the concomitant therapy trial ( CHRONOS ) , subjects received DUPIXENT or placebo with concomitant topical corticosteroids ( TCS ) and as needed topical calcineurin inhibitors for problem areas only , such as the face , neck , intertriginous and genital areas for 52 weeks .
All three trials assessed the primary endpoint , the change from baseline to Week 16 in the proportion of subjects with an IGA 0 ( clear ) or 1 ( almost clear ) and at least a 2 - point improvement .
Other endpoints included the proportion of subjects with EASI - 75 ( improvement of at least 75 % in EASI score from baseline ) , and reduction in itch as defined by at least a 4 - point improvement in the Peak Pruritus NRS from baseline to Week 16 .

In CHRONOS , of the 421 subjects , 353 had been on study for 52 weeks at the time of data analysis .
Of these 353 subjects , responders at Week 52 represent a mixture of subjects who maintained their efficacy from Week 16 ( e . g . , 53 % of DUPIXENT IGA 0 or 1 responders at Week 16 remained responders at Week 52 ) and subjects who were non - responders at Week 16 who later responded to treatment ( e . g . , 24 % of DUPIXENT IGA 0 or 1 non - responders at Week 16 became responders at Week 52 ) .
Results of supportive analyses of the 353 subjects in the DUPIXENT with concomitant TCS trial ( CHRONOS ) are presented in Table 11 .

[ 3 ] Subjects who received rescue treatment or with missing data were considered as non - responders .
Treatment effects in subgroups ( weight , age , gender , race , and prior treatment , including immunosuppressants ) in SOLO 1 , SOLO 2 , and CHRONOS were generally consistent with the results in the overall study population .
In SOLO 1 , SOLO 2 , and CHRONOS , a third randomized treatment arm of DUPIXENT 300 mg QW did not demonstrate additional treatment benefit over DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W .
Subjects in SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 who had an IGA 0 or 1 with a reduction of ≥ 2 points were re - randomized into SOLO CONTINUE ( NCT02395133 ) .
SOLO CONTINUE evaluated multiple DUPIXENT monotherapy dose regimens for maintaining treatment response .
The study included subjects randomized to continue with DUPIXENT 300 mg Q2W ( 62 subjects ) or switch to placebo ( 31 subjects ) for 36 weeks .
IGA 0 or 1 responses at Week 36 were as follows : 33 ( 53 % ) in the Q2W group and 3 ( 10 % ) in the placebo group .

[ 3 ] Responder was defined as a subject with an IGA 0 or 1 ( " clear " or " almost clear " ) .
[ 4 ] Subjects who received rescue treatment ( 63 % and 19 % in the placebo and DUPIXENT arms , respectively ) or with missing data were considered as non - responders .
14 . 2 Asthma The asthma development program for patients aged 12 years and older included three randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel - group , multicenter trials ( DRI12544 ( NCT01854047 ) , QUEST ( NCT02414854 ) , and VENTURE ( NCT02528214 ) ) of 24 to 52 weeks in treatment duration which enrolled a total of 2888 subjects .
Subjects enrolled in DRI12544 and QUEST were required to have a history of 1 or more asthma exacerbations that required treatment with systemic corticosteroids or emergency department visit or hospitalization for the treatment of asthma in the year prior to trial entry .
Subjects enrolled in VENTURE required dependence on daily oral corticosteroids in addition to regular use of high - dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional controller ( s ) .
In all 3 trials , subjects were enrolled without requiring a minimum baseline blood eosinophil count .
In QUEST and VENTURE , subjects with screening blood eosinophil level of > 1500 cells / mcL ( < 1 . 3 % ) were excluded .
DUPIXENT was administered as add - on to background asthma treatment .
Subjects continued background asthma therapy throughout the duration of the studies , except in VENTURE in which OCS dose was tapered as described below .
DRI12544 DRI12544 was a 24 - week dose - ranging study which included 776 adult subjects ( 18 years of age and older ) .
DUPIXENT compared with placebo was evaluated in adult subjects with moderate - to - severe asthma on a medium or high - dose inhaled corticosteroid and a long acting beta agonist .
Subjects were randomized to receive either 200 mg ( N = 150 ) or 300 mg ( N = 157 ) DUPIXENT every other week ( Q2W ) or 200 mg ( N = 154 ) or 300 mg ( N = 157 ) DUPIXENT every 4 weeks following an initial dose of 400 mg , 600 mg or placebo ( N = 158 ) , respectively .
The primary endpoint was mean change from baseline to Week 12 in FEV1 ( L ) in subjects with baseline blood eosinophils ≥ 300 cells / mcL .
Other endpoints included percent change from baseline in FEV1 and annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbation events during the 24 - week placebo - controlled treatment period .
Results were evaluated in the overall population and subgroups based on baseline blood eosinophil count ( ≥ 300 cells / mcL and < 300 cells / mcL ) .
Additional secondary endpoints included responder rates in the patient reported Asthma Control Questionnaire ( ACQ - 5 ) and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire , Standardized Version ( AQLQ ( S ) ) scores .
QUEST QUEST was a 52 - week study which included 1902 adult and pediatric subjects ( 12 years of age and older ) .
DUPIXENT compared with placebo was evaluated in 107 pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age and 1795 adult subjects with moderate - to - severe asthma on a medium or high - dose inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) and a minimum of one and up to two additional controller medications .
Subjects were randomized to receive either 200 mg ( N = 631 ) or 300 mg ( N = 633 ) DUPIXENT Q2W ( or matching placebo for either 200 mg [ N = 317 ] or 300 mg [ N = 321 ] Q2W ) following an initial dose of 400 mg , 600 mg or placebo , respectively .
The primary endpoints were the annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during the 52 - week placebo - controlled period and change from baseline in pre - bronchodilator FEV1 at Week 12 in the overall population ( unrestricted by minimum baseline blood eosinophils count ) .
Additional secondary endpoints included annualized severe exacerbation rates and FEV1 in subjects with different baseline levels of blood eosinophils as well as responder rates in the ACQ - 5 and AQLQ ( S ) scores .
VENTURE VENTURE was a 24 - week oral corticosteroid - reduction study in 210 adult and pediatric subjects 15 years of age and older with asthma who required daily oral corticosteroids in addition to regular use of high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus an additional controller .
After optimizing the OCS dose during the screening period , subjects received 300 mg DUPIXENT ( N = 103 ) or placebo ( N = 107 ) once Q2W for 24 weeks following an initial dose of 600 mg or placebo .
Subjects continued to receive their existing asthma medicine during the study ; however , their OCS dose was reduced every 4 weeks during the OCS reduction phase ( Week 4 - 20 ) , as long as asthma control was maintained .
The primary endpoint was the percent reduction of oral corticosteroid dose at Weeks 20 to 24 compared with the baseline dose , while maintaining asthma control in the overall population ( unrestricted by minimum baseline blood eosinophils count ) .
Additional secondary endpoints included the annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during treatment period and responder rate in the ACQ - 5 and AQLQ ( S ) scores .
The demographics and baseline characteristics of these 3 trials are provided in Table 15 below .

In the primary analysis population ( subjects with baseline blood eosinophil count of ≥ 300 cells / mcL in DRI12544 and the overall population in QUEST ) , subjects receiving either DUPIXENT 200 mg or 300 mg Q2W had significant reductions in the rate of asthma exacerbations compared to placebo .
In the overall population in QUEST , the rate of severe exacerbations was 0 . 46 and 0 . 52 for DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W and 300 mg Q2W , respectively , compared to matched placebo rates of 0 . 87 and 0 . 97 .
The rate ratio of severe exacerbations compared to placebo was 0 . 52 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 41 , 0 . 66 ) and 0 . 54 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 43 , 0 . 68 ) for DUPIXENT 200 mg Q2W and 300 mg Q2W , respectively .
Results in subjects with baseline blood eosinophil counts ≥ 300 cells / mcL in DRI12544 and QUEST are shown in Table 16 .
Response rates by baseline blood eosinophils and baseline FeNO for QUEST are shown for the overall population in Figure 4 and Figure 5 , respectively .
Elevation of FeNO can be a marker of the eosinophilic asthma phenotype when supported by clinical data .
Pre - specified subgroup analyses of DRI12544 and QUEST demonstrated that there were greater reductions in severe exacerbations in subjects with higher baseline blood eosinophil levels ( ≥ 150 cells / mcL ) or FeNO ( ≥ 25 ppb ) .
In QUEST , reductions in exacerbations were significant in the subgroup of subjects with baseline blood eosinophils ≥ 150 cells / mcL .
In subjects with baseline blood eosinophil count < 150 cells / mcL and FeNO < 25 ppb , similar severe exacerbation rates were observed between DUPIXENT and placebo .
In QUEST , the estimated rate ratio of exacerbations leading to hospitalizations and / or emergency room visits versus placebo was 0 . 53 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 28 , 1 . 03 ) and 0 . 74 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 32 , 1 . 70 ) with DUPIXENT 200 mg or 300 mg Q2W , respectively .

The responder rate was defined as an improvement in score of 0 . 5 or more ( scale range 0 - 6 for ACQ - 5 and 1 - 7 for AQLQ ( S ) ) .
• The ACQ - 5 responder rate for DUPIXENT 200 mg and 300 mg Q2W in the overall population was 69 % vs 62 % placebo ( odds ratio 1 . 37 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 01 , 1 . 86 ) and 69 % vs 63 % placebo ( odds ratio 1 . 28 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 94 , 1 . 73 ) , respectively ; and the AQLQ ( S ) responder rates were 62 % vs 54 % placebo ( odds ratio 1 . 61 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 17 , 2 . 21 ) and 62 % vs 57 % placebo ( odds ratio 1 . 33 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 98 , 1 . 81 ) , respectively .
• The ACQ - 5 responder rate for DUPIXENT 200 mg and 300 mg Q2W in subjects with baseline blood eosinophils ≥ 300 cells / mcL was 75 % vs 67 % placebo ( odds ratio : 1 . 46 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 90 , 2 . 35 ) and 71 % vs 64 % placebo ( odds ratio : 1 . 39 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 88 , 2 . 19 ) , respectively ; and the AQLQ ( S ) responder rates were 71 % vs 55 % placebo ( odds ratio : 2 . 02 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 24 , 3 . 32 ) and 65 % vs 55 % placebo ( odds ratio : 1 . 79 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 13 , 2 . 85 ) , respectively .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Oral Corticosteroid Reduction ( VENTURE ) VENTURE evaluated the effect of DUPIXENT on reducing the use of maintenance oral corticosteroids .
The baseline mean oral corticosteroid dose was 12 mg in the placebo group and 11 mg in the group receiving DUPIXENT .
The primary endpoint was the percent reduction from baseline of the final oral corticosteroid dose at Week 24 while maintaining asthma control .
Compared with placebo , subjects receiving DUPIXENT achieved greater reductions in daily maintenance oral corticosteroid dose , while maintaining asthma control .
The mean percent reduction in daily OCS dose from baseline was 70 % ( median 100 % ) in subjects receiving DUPIXENT ( 95 % CI : 60 % , 80 % ) compared to 42 % ( median 50 % ) in subjects receiving placebo ( 95 % CI : 33 % , 51 % ) .
Reductions of 50 % or higher in the OCS dose were observed in 82 ( 80 % ) subjects receiving DUPIXENT compared to 57 ( 53 % ) in those receiving placebo .
The proportion of subjects with a mean final dose less than 5 mg at Week 24 was 72 % for DUPIXENT and 37 % for placebo ( odds ratio 4 . 48 95 % CI : 2 . 39 , 8 . 39 ) .
A total of 54 ( 52 % ) subjects receiving DUPIXENT versus 31 ( 29 % ) subjects in the placebo group had a 100 % reduction in their OCS dose .
In this 24 - week trial , asthma exacerbations ( defined as a temporary increase in oral corticosteroid dose for at least 3 days ) were lower in subjects receiving DUPIXENT compared with those receiving placebo ( annualized rate 0 . 65 and 1 . 60 for the DUPIXENT and placebo group , respectively ; rate ratio 0 . 41 [ 95 % CI 0 . 26 , 0 . 63 ] ) and improvement in pre - bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline to Week 24 was greater in subjects receiving DUPIXENT compared with those receiving placebo ( LS mean difference for DUPIXENT versus placebo of 0 . 22 L [ 95 % CI : 0 . 09 to 0 . 34 L ] ) .
Effects on lung function and on oral steroid and exacerbation reduction were similar irrespective of baseline blood eosinophil levels .
The ACQ - 5 and AQLQ ( S ) were also assessed in VENTURE and showed improvements similar to those in QUEST .
Pediatric Subjects 6 to 11 Years of Age with Asthma The efficacy and safety of DUPIXENT in pediatric subjects was evaluated in a 52 - week multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study ( VOYAGE ; NCT02948959 ) in 408 subjects 6 to 11 years of age , with moderate - to - severe asthma on a medium or high - dose ICS and a second controller medication or high - dose ICS alone .
Subjects were required to have a history of 1 or more asthma exacerbation ( s ) that required treatment with systemic corticosteroids or emergency department visit or hospitalization for the treatment of asthma in the year prior to trial entry .
Subjects were randomized to DUPIXENT ( N = 273 ) or matching placebo ( N = 135 ) every other week based on body weight < 30 kg ( 100 mg Q2W ) or ≥ 30 kg ( 200 mg Q2W ) .
The effectiveness of DUPIXENT 300 mg Q4W was extrapolated from efficacy of 100 mg Q2W in VOYAGE with support from population pharmacokinetic analyses showing higher drug exposure levels with 300 mg Q4W [ see Pediatric Use ( 8 . 4 ) and Pharmacokinetics ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The primary endpoint was the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbation events during the 52 - week placebo - controlled period .
Severe asthma exacerbations were defined as deterioration of asthma requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days or hospitalization or emergency room visit due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids .
The key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in pre - bronchodilator FEV1 percent predicted at Week 12 .
Additional secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline and responder rates in the ACQ - 7 - IA ( Asthma Control Questionnaire - 7 - Interviewer Administered ) and PAQLQ ( S ) - IA ( Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire with Standardized Activities Interviewer Administered ) scores .
The demographics and baseline characteristics for VOYAGE are provided in Table 18 below .

Subgroup analyses for results of DUPIXENT treatment based upon either baseline eosinophil level or baseline FeNO level were similar to the pediatric ( 12 to 17 years of age ) and adult trials and are described for the adult and pediatric ( 12 to 17 years of age ) asthma population above .
In subjects with baseline blood eosinophil count < 150 cells / mcL and FeNO < 20 ppb , similar severe asthma exacerbation rates were observed between DUPIXENT and placebo .
Significant improvements in percent predicted pre - bronchodilator FEV1 were observed at Week 12 .
Significant improvements in percent predicted FEV1 were observed as early as Week 2 and were maintained through Week 52 in VOYAGE ( Figure 10 ) .
The efficacy results for VOYAGE are presented in Table 19 .

Greater responder rates were observed for ACQ - 7 - IA and PAQLQ ( S ) - IA compared to placebo at Week 24 .
The responder rate was defined as an improvement in score of 0 . 5 or more ( scale range 0 - 6 for ACQ - 7 - IA and 1 - 7 for PAQLQ ( S ) - IA ) .
In the subgroup of subjects with baseline blood eosinophil count ≥ 300 cells / mcL , DUPIXENT led to a higher proportion of subjects with a response in ACQ - 7 - IA ( 80 . 6 % versus 64 . 3 % for placebo ) with an OR of 2 . 79 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 43 , 5 . 44 ) , and in PAQLQ ( S ) - IA ( 72 . 8 % versus 63 . 0 % for placebo ) with an OR of 1 . 84 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 92 , 3 . 65 ) at Week 24 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 3 Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyposis The chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis ( CRSwNP ) development program included two randomized , double - blind , parallel - group , multicenter , placebo - controlled studies ( SINUS - 24 ( NCT02912468 ) and SINUS - 52 ( NCT02898454 ) ) in 724 adult subjects 18 years of age and older on background intranasal corticosteroids ( INCS ) .
These studies included subjects with CRSwNP despite prior sino - nasal surgery or treatment with , or who were ineligible to receive or were intolerant to , systemic corticosteroids in the past 2 years .
Subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis were not included in these trials .
Rescue with systemic corticosteroids or surgery was allowed during the studies at the investigator ' s discretion .
In SINUS - 24 , a total of 276 subjects were randomized to receive either 300 mg DUPIXENT ( N = 143 ) or placebo ( N = 133 ) every other week for 24 weeks .
In SINUS - 52 , 448 subjects were randomized to receive either 300 mg DUPIXENT ( N = 150 ) every other week for 52 weeks , 300 mg DUPIXENT ( N = 145 ) every other week until Week 24 followed by 300 mg DUPIXENT every 4 weeks until Week 52 , or placebo ( N = 153 ) .
All subjects had evidence of sinus opacification on the Lund Mackay ( LMK ) sinus CT scan and 73 % to 90 % of subjects had opacification of all sinuses .
Subjects were stratified based on their histories of prior surgery and co - morbid asthma / nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug exacerbated respiratory disease ( NSAID - ERD ) .
A total of 63 % of subjects reported previous sinus surgery , with a mean number of 2 . 0 prior surgeries , 74 % used systemic corticosteroids in the previous 2 years with a mean number of 1 . 6 systemic corticosteroid courses in the previous 2 years , 59 % had co - morbid asthma , and 28 % had NSAID - ERD .
The co - primary efficacy endpoints were change from baseline to Week 24 in bilateral endoscopic nasal polyps score ( NPS ; 0 - 8 scale ) as graded by central blinded readers , and change from baseline to Week 24 in nasal congestion / obstruction score averaged over 28 days ( NC ; 0 - 3 scale ) , as determined by subjects using a daily diary .
For NPS , polyps on each side of the nose were graded on a categorical scale ( 0 = no polyps ; 1 = small polyps in the middle meatus not reaching below the inferior border of the middle turbinate ; 2 = polyps reaching below the lower border of the middle turbinate ; 3 = large polyps reaching the lower border of the inferior turbinate or polyps medial to the middle turbinate ; 4 = large polyps causing complete obstruction of the inferior nasal cavity ) .
The total score was the sum of the right and left scores .
Nasal congestion was rated daily by the subjects on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale ( 0 = no symptoms ; 1 = mild symptoms ; 2 = moderate symptoms ; 3 = severe symptoms ) .
In both studies , key secondary end - points at Week 24 included change from baseline in : LMK sinus CT scan score , daily loss of smell , and 22 - item sino - nasal outcome test ( SNOT - 22 ) .
The LMK sinus CT scan score evaluated the opacification of each sinus using a 0 to 2 scale ( 0 = normal ; 1 = partial opacification ; 2 = total opacification ) deriving a maximum score of 12 per side and a total maximum score of 24 ( higher scores indicate more opacification ) .
Loss of smell was scored reflectively by the subject every morning on a 0 - 3 scale ( 0 = no symptoms , 1 = mild symptoms , 2 = moderate symptoms , 3 = severe symptoms ) .
SNOT - 22 includes 22 items assessing symptoms and symptom impact associated with CRSwNP with each item scored from 0 ( no problem ) to 5 ( problem as bad as it can be ) with a global score ranging from 0 to 110 .
SNOT - 22 had a 2 week recall period .
In the pooled efficacy results , the reduction in the proportion of subjects rescued with systemic corticosteroids and / or sino - nasal surgery ( up to Week 52 ) were evaluated .
The demographics and baseline characteristics of these 2 trials are provided in Table 20 below .

In the post - treatment period when subjects were off DUPIXENT , the treatment effect diminished over time ( see Figure 12 ) .
Figure 12 : LS Mean Change from Baseline in Bilateral Nasal Polyps Score ( NPS ) up to Week 48 in Subjects 18 Years of Age and Older with CRSwNP ( SINUS - 24 - ITT Population ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] At Week 52 , the LS mean difference for nasal congestion in the DUPIXENT group versus placebo was - 0 . 98 ( 95 % CI - 1 . 17 , - 0 . 79 ) .
In both studies , significant improvements in nasal congestion were observed as early as the first assessment at Week 4 .
The LS mean difference for nasal congestion at Week 4 in the DUPIXENT group versus placebo was - 0 . 41 ( 95 % CI : - 0 . 52 , - 0 . 30 ) in SINUS - 24 and - 0 . 37 ( 95 % CI : - 0 . 46 , - 0 . 27 ) in SINUS - 52 .

In subjects with co - morbid asthma , improvements in pre - bronchodilator FEV1 were similar to subjects in the asthma program .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 4 Eosinophilic Esophagitis A single randomized , double - blind , parallel - group , multicenter , placebo - controlled trial , including two 24 - week treatment periods ( Parts A and B ) , was conducted in adult and pediatric subjects 12 to 17 years of age , weighing at least 40 kg , with EoE ( NCT03633617 ) .
In both parts , subjects were randomized to receive 300 mg DUPIXENT every week or placebo .
Eligible subjects had ≥ 15 intraepithelial eosinophils per high - power field ( eos / hpf ) following a treatment course of a proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) either prior to or during the screening period and symptoms of dysphagia as measured by the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire ( DSQ ) .
At baseline , 43 % of subjects in Part A and 37 % of subjects in Part B had a history of prior esophageal dilations .
Demographics and baseline characteristics were similar in Parts A and B .
A total of 81 subjects ( 61 adults and 20 pediatric subjects ) were enrolled in Part A and 159 subjects ( 107 adults and 52 pediatric subjects ) were enrolled in Part B .
The mean age in years was 32 years ( range 13 to 62 years ) in Part A and 28 years ( range 12 to 66 years ) in Part B .
The majority of subjects were male ( 60 % in Part A and 68 % in Part B ) and White ( 96 % in Part A and 90 % in Part B ) .
The mean baseline DSQ score ( SD ) was 33 . 6 ( 12 . 4 ) in Part A and 37 . 2 ( 10 . 7 ) in Part B .
The coprimary efficacy endpoints in Parts A and B were the ( 1 ) proportion of subjects achieving histological remission defined as peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count of ≤ 6 eos / hpf at Week 24 ; and ( 2 ) the absolute change in the subject - reported DSQ score from baseline to Week 24 .
Efficacy results for Parts A and B are presented in Table 22 .

For absolute change in DSQ score , the LS mean changes , standard errors , and differences are estimated using an ANCOVA model with treatment group , randomization stratification factors , and baseline measurement as covariates .
[ 2 ] Total biweekly DSQ scores range from 0 to 84 ; higher scores indicate greater frequency and severity of dysphagia In Parts A and B , a greater proportion of subjects randomized to DUPIXENT achieved histological remission ( peak esophageal intraepithelial eosinophil count ≤ 6 eos / hpf ) compared to placebo .
Treatment with DUPIXENT also resulted in a significant improvement in LS mean change in DSQ score compared to placebo at Week 24 .
The results of the anchor - based analyses that incorporated the subjects ' perspectives indicated that the observed improvement in dysphagia from Parts A and B is representative of a clinically meaningful within - subject improvement .
14 . 5 Prurigo Nodularis The prurigo nodularis ( PN ) development program included two 24 - week randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , multicenter , parallel - group trials ( PRIME ( NCT04183335 ) and PRIME 2 ( NCT04202679 ) ) in 311 adult subjects 18 years of age and older with pruritus ( WI - NRS ≥ 7 on a scale of 0 to 10 ) and greater than or equal to 20 nodular lesions .
PRIME and PRIME 2 assessed the effect of DUPIXENT on pruritus improvement as well as its effect on PN lesions .
In these two trials , subjects received either subcutaneous DUPIXENT 600 mg ( two 300 mg injections ) on day 1 , followed by 300 mg once every other week ( Q2W ) for 24 weeks , or matching placebo .
In these trials , the mean age was 49 . 5 years , the median weight was 71 kg , 65 % of subjects were female , 57 % were White , 6 % were Black , and 34 % were Asian .
At baseline , the mean Worst Itch - Numeric Rating Scale ( WI - NRS ) was 8 . 5 , 66 % had 20 to 100 nodules ( moderate ) , and 34 % had greater than 100 nodules ( severe ) .
Eleven percent ( 11 % ) of subjects were taking stable doses of antidepressants at baseline and were instructed to continue taking these medications during the trial .
Forty - three percent ( 43 % ) had a history of atopy ( defined as having a medical history of AD , allergic rhinitis / rhinoconjunctivitis , asthma , or food allergy ) .
The WI - NRS is comprised of a single item , rated on a scale from 0 ( " no itch " ) to 10 ( " worst imaginable itch " ) .
Subjects were asked to rate the intensity of their worst pruritus ( itch ) over the past 24 hours using this scale .
The Investigator ' s Global Assessment for Prurigo Nodularis - Stage ( IGA PN - S ) is a scale that measures the approximate number of nodules using a 5 - point scale from 0 ( clear ) to 4 ( severe ) .
Efficacy was assessed with the proportion of subjects with improvement ( reduction ) in WI - NRS by ≥ 4 points , the proportion of subjects with IGA PN - S 0 or 1 ( the equivalent of 0 - 5 nodules ) , and the proportion of subjects who achieved a response in both WI - NRS and IGA PN - S per the criteria described above .
The efficacy results for PRIME and PRIME2 are presented in Table 23 and Figures 14 , 15 and 16 .
