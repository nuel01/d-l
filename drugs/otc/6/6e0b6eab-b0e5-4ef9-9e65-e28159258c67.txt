8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action , sunitinib malate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk .
In animal developmental and reproductive toxicology studies , oral administration of sunitinib to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout organogenesis resulted in teratogenicity ( embryolethality , craniofacial and skeletal malformations ) at 5 . 5 and 0 . 3 times the combined AUC ( the combined systemic exposure of sunitinib plus its active metabolite ) in patients administered the recommended daily doses ( RDD ) of 50 mg , respectively ( see Data ) .
Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In a female fertility and early embryonic development study , female rats were administered oral sunitinib ( 0 . 5 , 1 . 5 , 5 mg / kg / day ) for 21 days prior to mating and for 7 days after mating .
Embryolethality was observed at 5 mg / kg / day ( approximately 5 times the combined AUC in patients administered the RDD of 50 mg ) .
In embryo - fetal developmental toxicity studies , oral sunitinib was administered to pregnant rats ( 0 . 3 , 1 . 5 , 3 , 5 mg / kg / day ) and rabbits ( 0 . 5 , 1 , 5 , 20 mg / kg / day ) during the period of organogenesis .
In rats , embryolethality and skeletal malformations of the ribs and vertebrae were observed at the dose of 5 mg / kg / day ( approximately 5 . 5 times the combined AUC in patients administered the RDD of 50 mg ) .
No adverse fetal effects were observed in rats at doses ≤ 3 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 times the combined AUC in patients administered the RDD of 50 mg ) .
In rabbits , embryolethality was observed at 5 mg / kg / day ( approximately 3 times the combined AUC in patients administered the RDD of 50 mg ) , and craniofacial malformations ( cleft lip and cleft palate ) were observed at ≥ 1 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 3 times the combined AUC in patients administered the RDD of 50 mg ) .
Sunitinib ( 0 . 3 , 1 , 3 mg / kg / day ) was evaluated in a pre - and postnatal development study in pregnant rats .
Maternal body weight gains were reduced during gestation and lactation at doses ≥ 1 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 5 times the combined AUC in patients administered the RDD of 50 mg ) .
At 3 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 times the combined AUC in patients administered the RDD of 50 mg ) , reduced neonate body weights were observed at birth and persisted in the offspring of both sexes during the preweaning period and in males during postweaning period .
No adverse developmental effects were observed at doses ≤ 1 mg / kg / day .
8 . 2 Lactation There is no information regarding the presence of sunitinib and its metabolites in human milk .
Sunitinib and its metabolites were excreted in rat milk at concentrations up to 12 - fold higher than in plasma ( see Data ) .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with sunitinib malate and for at least 4 weeks after the last dose .
Data Animal Data In lactating female rats administered 15 mg / kg , sunitinib and its metabolites were excreted in milk at concentrations up to 12 - fold higher than in plasma .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Sunitinib malate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with sunitinib malate .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with sunitinib malate and for at least 4 weeks after the last dose .
Males Based on findings in animal reproduction studies , advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with sunitinib malate and for 7 weeks after the last dose .
Infertility Based on findings in animals , sunitinib malate may impair male and female fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of sunitinib malate in pediatric patients have not been established .
Safety and pharmacokinetics of sunitinib were assessed in an open - label study ( NCT00387920 ) in pediatric patients 2 years to < 17 years of age ( n = 29 ) with refractory solid tumors .
In addition , efficacy , safety and pharmacokinetics of sunitinib was assessed in another open - label study ( NCT01462695 ) in pediatric patients 2 years to < 17 years of age ( n = 27 ) with high - grade glioma or ependymoma .
The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) normalized for body surface area ( BSA ) was lower in pediatric patients compared to adults .
Sunitinib was poorly tolerated in pediatric patients .
The occurrence of dose - limiting cardiotoxicity prompted an amendment of the NCT00387920 study to exclude patients with previous exposure to anthracyclines or cardiac radiation .
No responses were reported in patients in either of the trials .
Apparent clearance and volume of distribution normalized for BSA for sunitinib and its active major metabolite were lower in pediatrics as compared to adults .
The effect on open tibial growth plates in pediatric patients who received sunitinib malate has not been adequately studied .
See Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data below .
Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Physeal dysplasia was present in cynomolgus monkeys with open growth plates treated with sunitinib for ≥ 3 months ( 3 month dosing 2 , 6 , 12 mg / kg / day ; 8 cycles of dosing 0 . 3 , 1 . 5 , 6 . 0 mg / kg / day ) at doses that were > 0 . 4 times the combined AUC ( the combined systemic exposure of sunitinib plus its active metabolite ) in patients administered the RDD of 50 mg .
The no - effect level ( NOEL ) was 1 . 5 mg / kg / day in monkeys treated intermittently for 8 cycles , but was not identified in monkeys treated continuously for 3 months .
In developing rats treated continuously for 3 months ( 1 . 5 , 5 . 0 , and 15 . 0 mg / kg ) or 5 cycles ( 0 . 3 , 1 . 5 , and 6 . 0 mg / kg / day ) , bone abnormalities consisted of thickening of the epiphyseal cartilage of the femur and an increase of fracture of the tibia at doses ≥ 5 mg / kg ( approximately 10 times the combined AUC in patients administered the RDD of 50 mg ) .
Additionally , tooth caries were present in rats at > 5 mg / kg .
The incidence and severity of physeal dysplasia were dose related and reversible upon cessation of treatment ; however , findings in the teeth were not .
In rats , the NOEL in bones was ≤ 2 mg / kg / day .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 7527 patients with GIST , RCC ( advanced and adjuvant ) , or pNET who received sunitinib malate , 32 % were 65 years and older , and 7 % were 75 years and older .
Patients aged 65 years of age and older had a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions ( 67 % ) than younger patients ( 60 % ) .
In the GIST study , 73 ( 30 % ) of the patients who received sunitinib malate were 65 years and older .
In the mRCC study , 152 ( 41 % ) of patients who received sunitinib malate were 65 years and older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients .
In the pNET study , 22 ( 27 % ) of the patients who received sunitinib malate were 65 years and older .
Clinical studies of sunitinib malate did not include sufficient numbers of patients with pNET to determine if patients 65 years of age and older respond differently than younger patients .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate ( Child - Pugh Class A or B ) hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Sunitinib malate was not studied in patients with severe ( Child - Pugh Class C ) hepatic impairment .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild ( CLcr 50 to 80 mL / min ) , moderate ( CLcr 30 to < 50 mL / min ) , or severe ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) renal impairment who are not on dialysis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) on hemodialysis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Treatment of overdose with sunitinib malate should consist of general supportive measures .
There is no specific antidote for overdosage with sunitinib malate .
If indicated , elimination of unabsorbed drug should be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage .
Cases of accidental overdose have been reported ; these cases were associated with adverse reactions consistent with the known safety profile of sunitinib malate , or without adverse reactions .
In nonclinical studies , mortality was observed following as few as 5 daily doses of 500 mg / kg ( 3 , 000 mg / m2 ) in rats .
At this dose , signs of toxicity included impaired muscle coordination , head shakes , hypoactivity , ocular discharge , piloerection , and gastrointestinal distress .
Mortality and similar signs of toxicity were observed at lower doses when administered for longer durations .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Sunitinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) , some of which are implicated in tumor growth , pathologic angiogenesis , and metastatic progression of cancer .
Sunitinib was evaluated for its inhibitory activity against a variety of kinases ( > 80 kinases ) and was identified as an inhibitor of platelet - derived growth factor receptors ( PDGFRα and PDGFRβ ) , vascular endothelial growth factor receptors ( VEGFR1 , VEGFR2 , and VEGFR3 ) , stem cell factor receptor ( KIT ) , Fms - like tyrosine kinase - 3 ( FLT3 ) , colony stimulating factor receptor Type 1 ( CSF - 1 R ) , and the glial cell - line derived neurotrophic factor receptor ( RET ) .
Sunitinib inhibition of the activity of these RTKs has been demonstrated in biochemical and cellular assays , and inhibition of function has been demonstrated in cell proliferation assays .
The primary metabolite exhibits similar potency compared to sunitinib in biochemical and cellular assays .
Sunitinib inhibited the phosphorylation of multiple RTKs ( PDGFRβ , VEGFR2 , KIT ) in tumor xenografts expressing RTK targets in vivo and demonstrated inhibition of tumor growth or tumor regression and / or inhibited metastases in some experimental models of cancer .
Sunitinib demonstrated the ability to inhibit growth of tumor cells expressing dysregulated target RTKs ( PDGFR , RET , or KIT ) in vitro and to inhibit PDGFRβ - and VEGFR2 - dependent tumor angiogenesis in vivo .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure - Response Relationship Based on population pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic analyses , there were relationships between changes in different pharmacodynamic endpoints ( i . e . , safety and efficacy endpoints ) over time and sunitinib plasma exposures .
Cardiac Electrophysiology Sunitinib malate can cause QT interval prolongation in a dose - dependent manner , which may lead to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias including Torsade de Pointes [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sunitinib and sunitinib malate have been evaluated in healthy subjects and in patients with solid tumors .
Sunitinib AUC and Cmax increase proportionately over a dose range of 25 mg to 100 mg ( 0 . 5 to 2 times the approved RDD of 50 mg ) .
The pharmacokinetics were similar in healthy subjects and in patients with a solid tumor , including patients with GIST and RCC .
No significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of sunitinib or the primary active metabolite were observed with repeated daily administration or with repeated cycles .
With repeated daily administration , sunitinib accumulates 3 - to 4 - fold while the primary metabolite accumulates 7 - to 10 - fold .
Steady - state concentrations of sunitinib and its primary active metabolite are achieved within 10 to 14 days .
By Day 14 , combined plasma concentrations of sunitinib and its active metabolite ranged from 63 to 101 ng / mL .
Absorption Following oral administration of sunitinib , the time to maximum plasma concentration ( Tmax ) ranged from 6 to 12 hours .
Effect of Food The administration of a single dose of sunitinib malate 50 mg with a high - fat , high - calorie meal ( consisting of approximately 150 protein calories and 500 to 600 fat calories ) in healthy subjects had no clinically significant effect on sunitinib malate or active metabolites exposure .
Distribution The apparent volume of distribution ( Vd / F ) for sunitinib is 2230 L . Binding of sunitinib and its primary active metabolite to human plasma protein in vitro is 95 % and 90 % , respectively , with no concentration dependence in the range of 100 to 4000 ng / mL .
Elimination Following administration of a single oral dose in healthy subjects , the terminal half - lives of sunitinib and its primary active metabolite are approximately 40 to 60 hours and 80 to 110 hours , respectively .
Sunitinib total oral clearance ( CL / F ) ranged from 34 to 62 L / h with an interpatient variability of 40 % .
Metabolism Sunitinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 to its primary active metabolite , which is further metabolized by CYP3A4 .
The primary active metabolite comprises 23 % to 37 % of the total exposure .
After a radiolabeled dose , sunitinib and its active metabolite were the major compounds identified in plasma , accounting for 92 % of radioactivity .
Excretion After a radiolabeled dose of sunitinib , approximately 61 % of the dose was recovered in feces and 16 % in urine .
Sunitinib and its primary active metabolite were the major compounds identified in urine and feces , representing 86 % and 74 % of radioactivity , respectively .
Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of sunitinib or the primary active metabolite were observed based on age ( 18 to 84 years ) , body weight ( 34 to 168 kg ) , race ( White , Black , or Asian ) , sex , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) score , mild ( Child - Pugh Class A ) or moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B ) hepatic impairment .
Patients with Renal Impairment No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of sunitinib or its active metabolite were predicted or observed in patients with mild ( CLcr 50 to 80 mL / min ) , moderate ( CLcr 30 to < 50 mL / min ) , or severe ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) renal impairment who are not on dialysis , compared to patients with normal renal function ( CLcr > 80 mL / min ) .
Although sunitinib was not eliminated through hemodialysis , the sunitinib systemic exposure was 47 % lower in patients with end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) on hemodialysis compared to patients with normal renal function .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors on sunitinib : Coadministration of a single sunitinib malate dose with ketoconazole ( strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ) increased the combined sunitinib and its active metabolite Cmax and AUC0 - inf by 49 % and 51 % , respectively , in healthy subjects .
Effect of strong CYP3A4 inducers on sunitinib : Coadministration of a single sunitinib malate dose with rifampin ( strong CYP3A4 inducer ) reduced the combined sunitinib and its active metabolite Cmax and AUC0 - inf by 23 % and 46 % , respectively in healthy subjects .
In Vitro Studies In vitro studies in human hepatocytes and microsomes indicated that sunitinib and the primary active metabolite do not induce CYP1A2 , CYP2E1 , and CYP3A4 / 5 , or inhibit CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 , CYP3A4 / 5 , and CYP4A9 / 11 at clinically relevant concentrations .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of sunitinib has been evaluated in 2 species : rasH2 transgenic mice and Sprague - Dawley rats .
There were similar positive findings in both species .
In rasH2 transgenic mice , gastroduodenal carcinomas and / or gastric mucosal hyperplasia , as well as an increased incidence of background hemangiosarcomas were observed at sunitinib daily doses of ≥ 25 mg / kg / day in studies of 1 or 6 months duration .
No proliferative changes were observed in rasH2 transgenic mice at 8 mg / kg / day .
Similarly , in a 2 - year rat carcinogenicity study , administration of sunitinib in 28 - day cycles followed by 7 - day dose - free periods resulted in findings of duodenal carcinoma at doses as low as 1 mg / kg / day [ approximately 0 . 9 times the combined AUC ( combined systemic exposure of sunitinib plus its active metabolite ) in patients administered the RDD of 50 mg ] .
At the high dose of 3 mg / kg / day ( approximately 8 times the combined AUC in patients administered the RDD of 50 mg ) , the incidence of duodenal tumors was increased and was accompanied by findings of gastric mucous cell hyperplasia and by an increased incidence of pheochromocytoma and hyperplasia of the adrenal gland .
Sunitinib did not cause genetic damage when tested in in vitro assays [ bacterial mutation ( Ames test ) , human lymphocyte chromosome aberration ] and an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus test .
In a female fertility and early embryonic development study , female rats were administered oral sunitinib ( 0 . 5 , 1 . 5 , 5 mg / kg / day ) for 21 days prior to mating and for 7 days after mating .
Preimplantation loss was observed in females administered 5 mg / kg / day ( approximately 5 times the combined AUC in patients administered the RDD of 50 mg ) .
No adverse effects on fertility were observed at doses ≤ 1 . 5 mg / kg / day ( approximately equal to the combined AUC in patients administered the RDD of 50 mg ) .
In addition , effects on the female reproductive system were identified in a 3 - month oral repeat - dose monkey study ( 2 , 6 , 12 mg / kg / day ) .
Ovarian changes ( decreased follicular development ) were noted at 12 mg / kg / day ( approximately 5 times the combined AUC in patients administered the RDD of 50 mg ) , while uterine changes ( endometrial atrophy ) were noted at ≥ 2 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 4 times the combined AUC in patients administered the RDD of 50 mg ) .
With the addition of vaginal atrophy , the uterine and ovarian effects were reproduced at 6 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 8 times the combined AUC in patients administered the RDD of 50 mg ) in a 9 - month monkey study ( 0 . 3 , 1 . 5 , and 6 mg / kg / day administered daily for 28 days followed by a 14 - day respite ) .
In a male fertility study , no reproductive effects were observed in male rats dosed with 1 , 3 , or 10 mg / kg / day oral sunitinib for 58 days prior to mating with untreated females .
Fertility , copulation , conception indices , and sperm evaluation ( morphology , concentration , and motility ) were unaffected by sunitinib at doses ≤ 10 mg / kg / day ( approximately ≥ 26 times the combined AUC in patients administered the RDD of 50 mg ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor Study 1 Study 1 ( NCT # 00075218 ) was a 2 - arm , international , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial of sunitinib malate in patients with GIST who had disease progression during prior imatinib mesylate ( imatinib ) treatment or who were intolerant of imatinib .
The objective was to compare time - to - tumor progression ( TTP ) in patients receiving sunitinib malate plus best supportive care versus patients receiving placebo plus best supportive care .
Other objectives included progression - free survival ( PFS ) , objective response rate ( ORR ) , and overall survival ( OS ) .
Patients were randomized ( 2 : 1 ) to receive either 50 mg sunitinib malate or placebo orally , once daily , on Schedule 4 / 2 until disease progression or withdrawal from the study for another reason .
Treatment was unblinded at the time of disease progression .
Patients randomized to placebo were then offered crossover to open - label sunitinib malate and patients randomized to sunitinib malate were permitted to continue treatment per investigator judgment .
At the time of a prespecified interim analysis , the intent - to - treat ( ITT ) population included 312 patients .
Two hundred seven ( 207 ) patients were randomized to the sunitinib malate arm and 105 patients were randomized to the placebo arm .
Demographics were comparable between the sunitinib malate and placebo groups with regard to age ( 69 % versus 72 % < 65 years for sunitinib malate versus placebo , respectively ) , sex ( male : 64 % versus 61 % ) , race ( White : 88 % both arms , Asian : 5 % both arms , Black : 4 % both arms , remainder not reported ) , and performance status ( ECOG 0 : 44 % versus 46 % , ECOG 1 : 55 % versus 52 % , and ECOG 2 : 1 % versus 2 % ) .
Prior treatment included surgery ( 94 % versus 93 % ) and radiotherapy ( 8 % versus 15 % ) .
Outcome of prior imatinib treatment was also comparable between arms with intolerance ( 4 % versus 4 % ) , progression within 6 months of starting treatment ( 17 % versus 16 % ) , or progression beyond 6 months ( 78 % versus 80 % ) balanced .
The planned interim efficacy and safety analysis was performed after 149 TTP events had occurred .
There was a statistically significant advantage for sunitinib malate over placebo in TTP , meeting the primary endpoint .
Efficacy results are summarized in Table 10 and the Kaplan - Meier curve for TTP is shown in Figure 1 .

The final ITT population enrolled in the double - blind treatment phase of the study included 243 patients randomized to the sunitinib malate arm and 118 patients randomized to the placebo arm .
After the primary endpoint was met at the interim analysis , the study was unblinded , and patients on the placebo arm were offered open - label sunitinib malate treatment .
Ninety - nine ( 99 ) of the patients initially randomized to placebo crossed over to receive sunitinib malate in the open - label treatment phase .
At the protocol specified final analysis of OS , the median OS was 72 . 7 weeks for the sunitinib malate arm and 64 . 9 weeks for the placebo arm [ hazard ratio ( HR ) = 0 . 876 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) ( 0 . 679 , 1 . 129 ) ] .
Study 2 Study 2 was an open - label , multi - center , single - arm , dose - escalation study conducted in patients with GIST following progression on , or intolerance to imatinib .
Following identification of the recommended regimen ( 50 mg once daily on Schedule 4 / 2 ) , 55 patients in this study received the 50 mg dose of sunitinib malate on treatment Schedule 4 / 2 .
Partial responses ( PR ) were observed in 5 of 55 patients ( 9 . 1 % PR rate ; 95 % CI : 3 . 0 % , 20 . 0 % ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Renal Cell Carcinoma Treatment - Naïve Study 3 ( NCT # 00083889 ) was a multi - center , international , randomized study comparing single - agent sunitinib malate with interferon alfa was conducted in patients with treatment - naïve RCC .
The objective was to compare PFS in patients receiving sunitinib malate versus patients receiving interferon alfa .
Other endpoints included ORR , OS , and safety .
Seven hundred fifty ( 750 ) patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to receive either 50 mg sunitinib malate once daily on Schedule 4 / 2 or to receive interferon alfa administered subcutaneously at 9 million international units ( MIU ) 3 times a week .
Patients were treated until disease progression or withdrawal from the study .
The ITT population included 750 patients , 375 randomized to sunitinib malate and 375 randomized to interferon alfa .
Demographics were comparable between the sunitinib malate and interferon alfa groups with regard to age ( 59 % versus 67 % < 65 years for sunitinib malate versus interferon alfa , respectively ) , sex ( male : 71 % versus 72 % ) , race ( White : 94 % versus 91 % , Asian : 2 % versus 3 % , Black : 1 % versus 2 % , remainder not reported ) , and performance status ( ECOG 0 : 62 % versus 61 % , ECOG 1 : 38 % each arm , ECOG 2 : 0 versus 1 % ) .
Prior treatment included nephrectomy ( 91 % versus 89 % ) and radiotherapy ( 14 % each arm ) .
The most common site of metastases present at screening was the lung ( 78 % versus 80 % , respectively ) , followed by the lymph nodes ( 58 % versus 53 % , respectively ) and bone ( 30 % each arm ) ; the majority of the patients had multiple ( 2 or more ) metastatic sites at baseline ( 80 % versus 77 % , respectively ) .
There was a statistically significant advantage for sunitinib malate over interferon alfa in the endpoint of PFS ( see Table 11 and Figure 2 ) .
In the prespecified stratification factors of lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) ( > 1 . 5 ULN versus ≤ 1 . 5 ULN ) , ECOG performance status ( 0 versus 1 ) , and prior nephrectomy ( yes versus no ) , the hazard ratio favored sunitinib malate over interferon alfa .
The ORR was higher in the sunitinib malate arm ( see Table 11 ) .

At the protocol - specified final analysis of OS , the median OS was 114 . 6 weeks for the sunitinib malate arm and 94 . 9 weeks for the interferon alfa arm ( HR = 0 . 821 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 673 , 1 . 001 ) .
The median OS for the interferon alfa arm includes 25 patients who discontinued interferon alfa treatment because of disease progression and crossed over to treatment with sunitinib malate as well as 121 patients ( 32 % ) on the interferon alfa arm who received post - study cancer treatment with sunitinib malate .
Cytokine - Refractory The use of single - agent sunitinib malate in the treatment of cytokine - refractory RCC was investigated in 2 single - arm , multi - center studies .
All patients enrolled into these studies experienced failure of prior cytokine - based therapy .
In Study 4 ( NCT # 00077974 ) , failure of prior cytokine therapy was based on radiographic evidence of disease progression defined by response evaluation criteria in solid tumors ( RECIST ) or World Health Organization ( WHO ) criteria during or within 9 months of completion of 1 cytokine therapy treatment ( interferon alfa , interleukin - 2 , or interferon alfa plus interleukin - 2 ; patients who were treated with interferon alfa alone must have received treatment for at least 28 days ) .
In Study 5 ( NCT # 00054886 ) , failure of prior cytokine therapy was defined as disease progression or unacceptable treatment - related toxicity .
The endpoint for both studies was ORR .
Duration of response ( DR ) was also evaluated .
One hundred and six patients ( 106 ) were enrolled into Study 4 and 63 patients were enrolled into Study 5 .
Patients received 50 mg sunitinib malate on Schedule 4 / 2 .
Therapy was continued until the patients met withdrawal criteria or had progressive disease .
The baseline age , sex , race , and ECOG performance statuses of the patients were comparable between Studies 4 and 5 .
Approximately 86 % to 94 % of patients in the 2 studies were White .
Men comprised 65 % of the pooled population .
The median age was 57 years and ranged from 24 to 87 years in the studies .
All patients had an ECOG performance status < 2 at the screening visit .
The baseline malignancy and prior treatment history of the patients were comparable between Studies 4 and 5 .
Across the 2 studies , 95 % of the pooled population of patients had at least some component of clear - cell histology .
All patients in Study 4 were required to have a histological clear - cell component .
Most patients enrolled in the studies ( 97 % of the pooled population ) had undergone nephrectomy ; prior nephrectomy was required for patients enrolled in Study 4 .
All patients had received 1 previous cytokine regimen .
Metastatic disease present at the time of study entry included lung metastases in 81 % of patients .
Liver metastases were more common in Study 4 ( 27 % versus 16 % in Study 5 ) and bone metastases were more common in Study 5 ( 51 % versus 25 % in Study 4 ) ; 52 % of patients in the pooled population had at least 3 metastatic sites .
Patients with known brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease were excluded from both studies .
The ORR and DR data from Studies 4 and 5 are provided in Table 12 .
There were 36 PRs in Study 4 as assessed by a core radiology laboratory for an ORR of 34 . 0 % ( 95 % CI : 25 . 0 % , 43 . 8 % ) .
There were 23 PRs in Study 5 as assessed by the investigators for an ORR of 36 . 5 % ( 95 % CI : 24 . 7 % , 49 . 6 % ) .
The majority ( > 90 % ) of objective disease responses were observed during the first 4 cycles ; the latest reported response was observed in Cycle 10 .
DR data from Study 4 is premature as only 9 of 36 patients ( 25 % ) responding to treatment had experienced disease progression or died at the time of the data cutoff .

Adjuvant Treatment In the adjuvant treatment setting , sunitinib malate was investigated in S - TRAC ( NCT # 00375674 ) , a multi - center , international , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , trial in patients with high risk of recurrent RCC following nephrectomy .
Patients were required to have clear cell histology and high risk of recurrence defined as ≥ T3 and / or N + tumors .
Six hundred fifteen ( 615 ) patients were randomized 1 : 1 to receive either 50 mg sunitinib malate once daily on Schedule 4 / 2 or placebo .
Patients were treated for 9 cycles ( approximately 1 year ) , or until disease recurrence , unacceptable toxicity , or withdrawal of consent .
Demographics were generally comparable between the sunitinib malate and placebo arms with regard to age ( median age 58 years ) , sex ( 73 % male ) , and race ( 84 % White , 12 % Asian and 4 % Other ) .
At randomization , most patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 ( 74 % sunitinib malate and 72 % placebo ) .
The remainder of the patients had an ECOG performance status of 1 ; 1 patient on sunitinib malate had a performance status of 2 .
The major efficacy outcome measure was disease - free survival ( DFS ) in patients receiving sunitinib malate versus placebo as assessed by blinded independent central review ( BICR ) .
Overall survival was an additional endpoint .
There was a statistically significant improvement in DFS in patients who were treated with sunitinib malate compared to placebo ( Table 13 and Figure 3 ) .
Prespecified subgroup analyses are presented in Table 14 .
At the time of the DFS analysis , overall survival data were not mature , with 141 / 615 ( 23 % ) patient deaths .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 3 Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors Study 6 ( NCT # 00428597 ) was a multi - center , international , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study of single - agent sunitinib malate conducted in patients with unresectable pNET .
Patients were required to have documented RECIST - defined disease progression within the prior 12 months and were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to receive either 37 . 5 mg sunitinib malate ( N = 86 ) or placebo ( N = 85 ) once daily without a scheduled off - treatment period .
The primary objective was to compare PFS in patients receiving sunitinib malate versus patients receiving placebo .
Other endpoints included OS , ORR , and safety .
Use of somatostatin analogs was allowed in the study .
Demographics were comparable between the sunitinib malate and placebo groups .
Additionally , 49 % of sunitinib malate patients had nonfunctioning tumors vs 52 % of placebo patients , and 92 % patients in both arms had liver metastases .
A total of 66 % of sunitinib malate patients received prior systemic therapy compared with 72 % of placebo patients and 35 % of sunitinib malate patients had received somatostatin analogs compared with 38 % of placebo patients .
Patients were treated until disease progression or withdrawal from the study .
Upon disease progression or study closure , patients were offered access to sunitinib malate in a separate extension study .
As recommended by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee , the study was terminated prematurely prior to the prespecified interim analysis .
This may have led to an overestimate of the magnitude of PFS effect .
A clinically significant improvement for sunitinib malate over placebo in PFS was seen by both investigator and independent assessment .
A hazard ratio favoring sunitinib malate was observed in all subgroups of baseline characteristics evaluated .
