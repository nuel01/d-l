[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Benzonatate acts peripherally by anesthetizing the stretch receptors located in the respiratory passages , lungs , and pleura by dampening their activity and thereby reducing the cough reflex at its source .
It begins to act within 15 to 20 minutes and its effect lasts for 3 to 8 hours .
Benzonatate has no inhibitory effect on the respiratory center in recommended dosage .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Benzonatate is indicated for the symptomatic relief of cough .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to benzonatate or related compounds .
BOXED WARNING Hypersensitivity Severe hypersensitivity reactions ( including bronchospasm , laryngospasm and cardiovascular collapse ) have been reported which are possibly related to local anesthesia from sucking or chewing the capsule instead of swallowing it .
Severe reactions have required intervention with vasopressor agents and supportive measures .
Psychiatric Effects Isolated instances of bizarre behavior , including mental confusion and visual hallucinations , have also been reported in patients taking benzonatate in combination with other prescribed drugs .
Accidental Ingestion and Death in Children Keep benzonatate out of reach of children .
Accidental ingestion of benzonatate resulting in death has been reported in children below age 10 .
Signs and symptoms of overdose have been reported within 15 to 20 minutes and death has been reported within one hour of ingestion .
If accidental ingestion occurs , seek medical attention immediately ( see OVERDOSAGE ) .
PRECAUTIONS Benzonatate is chemically related to anesthetic agents of the para - amino - benzoic acid class ( e . g . , procaine ; tetracaine ) and has been associated with adverse CNS effects possibly related to a prior sensitivity to related agents or interaction with concomitant medication .
Information for Patients : Swallow benzonatate capsules whole .
Do not break , chew , dissolve , cut , or crush benzonatate capsules .
Release of benzonatate from the capsule in the mouth can produce a temporary local anesthesia of the oral mucosa and choking could occur .
If numbness or tingling of the tongue , mouth , throat , or face occurs , refrain from oral ingestion of food or liquids until the numbness has resolved .
If the symptoms worsen or persist , seek medical attention .
Keep benzonatate out of reach of children .
Accidental ingestion resulting in death has been reported in children .
Signs and symptoms of overdose have been reported within 15 to 20 minutes and death has been reported within one hour of ingestion .
Signs and symptoms may include restlessness , tremors , convulsions , coma and cardiac arrest .
If accidental ingestion occurs , seek medical attention immediately .
Overdosage resulting in death may occur in adults .
Do not exceed a single dose of 200 mg and a total daily dose of 600 mg .

Drugs of this type are generally well absorbed after ingestion .
Signs and Symptoms : The signs and symptoms of overdose of benzonatate have been reported within 15 to 20 minutes .
If capsules are chewed or dissolved in the mouth , oropharyngeal anesthesia will develop rapidly , which may cause choking and airway compromise .

Treatment : In case of overdose , seek medical attention immediately .
Evacuate gastric contents and administer copious amounts of activated charcoal slurry .
Even in the conscious patient , cough and gag refluxes may be so depressed as to necessitate special attention to protection against aspiration of gastric contents and orally administered materials .
Convulsions should be treated with a short - acting barbiturate given intravenously and carefully titrated for the smallest effective dosage .
Intensive support of respiration and cardiovascular - renal function is an essential feature of the treatment of severe intoxication from overdosage .
Do not use CNS stimulants .
