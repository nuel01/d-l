( 1 . 1 ) To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of SIVEXTRO and other antibacterial drugs , SIVEXTRO should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria .
1 . 1 Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections SIVEXTRO ® is an oxazolidinone - class antibacterial indicated in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections ( ABSSSI ) caused by susceptible isolates of the following Gram - positive microorganisms : Staphylococcus aureus ( including methicillin - resistant [ MRSA ] and methicillin - susceptible [ MSSA ] isolates ) , Streptococcus pyogenes , Streptococcus agalactiae , Streptococcus anginosus Group ( including Streptococcus anginosus , Streptococcus intermedius , and Streptococcus constellatus ) , and Enterococcus faecalis .
1 . 2 Usage To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of SIVEXTRO and other antibacterial drugs , SIVEXTRO should be used only to treat ABSSSI that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria .
When culture and susceptibility information are available , they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy .
In the absence of such data , local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy .

In an animal model of infection , the antibacterial activity of SIVEXTRO was reduced in the absence of granulocytes .
Consider alternative therapies in neutropenic patients .
( 5 . 1 ) • Clostridioides difficile - associated diarrhea : Evaluate if diarrhea occurs .
( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Patients with Neutropenia The safety and efficacy of SIVEXTRO in patients with neutropenia ( neutrophil counts < 1000 cells / mm3 ) have not been adequately evaluated .
In an animal model of infection , the antibacterial activity of SIVEXTRO was reduced in the absence of granulocytes [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Alternative therapies should be considered when treating patients with neutropenia and ABSSSI .
5 . 2 Clostridioides difficile - Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile - associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported for nearly all systemic antibacterial agents including SIVEXTRO , with severity ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents can alter the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use .
Careful medical history is necessary because CDAD has been reported to occur more than two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , antibacterial use not directed against C . difficile should be discontinued , if possible .
Appropriate measures such as fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibacterial treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
5 . 3 Development of Drug - Resistant Bacteria Prescribing SIVEXTRO in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 2 % ) in adults are nausea , headache , diarrhea , infusion - or injection - related adverse reactions , vomiting , and dizziness .
The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 2 % ) in pediatric patients are phlebitis , and increased hepatic transaminases .

In the Phase 3 trials , clinically significant changes in these parameters were generally similar for both treatment arms ( see Table 3 ) .
In postmarketing experience , thrombocytopenia has been reported in patients treated with SIVEXTRO .
In one postmarketing report , patients who experienced thrombocytopenia were treated with tedizolid for a median duration of 26 . 5 days .
A duration of treatment beyond 6 days is not approved .
Peripheral and Optic Neuropathy Peripheral and optic neuropathy have been described in patients treated with another member of the oxazolidinone class for longer than 28 days .
In Phase 3 trials in adults , reported adverse reactions for peripheral neuropathy and optic nerve disorders were similar between both treatment arms ( peripheral neuropathy 1 . 2 % vs . 0 . 7 % for tedizolid phosphate and linezolid , respectively ; optic nerve disorders 0 . 3 % vs . 0 . 1 % , respectively ) .
Pediatric Patients Adverse reactions were evaluated in 91 pediatric patients with ABSSSI ranging from 12 to < 18 years of age treated with IV and / or oral SIVEXTRO 200 mg for 6 days and 29 patients treated with comparator agents for 10 days .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : thrombocytopenia 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Orally administered SIVEXTRO inhibits Breast Cancer Resistance Protein ( BCRP ) in the intestine , which can increase the plasma concentrations of orally administered BCRP substrates , and the potential for adverse reactions .
If possible , an interruption in the treatment of the co - administered BCRP substrate medicinal product should be considered during treatment with SIVEXTRO , especially for BCRP substrates with a narrow therapeutic index ( e . g . , methotrexate or topotecan ) .
If coadministration cannot be avoided , monitor for adverse reactions related to the concomitantly administered BCRP substrates , including rosuvastatin .
[ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) . ]
SIVEXTRO ( when administered orally ) can increase the plasma concentrations of orally administered Breast Cancer Resistance Protein ( BCRP ) substrates .
Monitor for adverse reactions related to the concomitant BCRP substrates if coadministration cannot be avoided .
( 7 , 12 . 3 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : Based on animal data , SIVEXTRO may cause fetal harm .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risks to a fetus .
( 8 . 1 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal reproduction studies , SIVEXTRO may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women .
The available data on the use of SIVEXTRO in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risks to a fetus .
Fetal developmental toxicities were observed in mice and rats treated with SIVEXTRO .
In embryo - fetal studies in mice and rats , tedizolid phosphate was shown to produce fetal developmental toxicities in mice and maternal toxicity and fetal developmental toxicities in rats .
Tedizolid phosphate administered orally during organogenesis to pregnant animals was associated with reduced fetal weights and an increased incidence of costal cartilage anomalies in the absence of maternal toxicity in mice ; and maternal toxicity , decreased fetal weights , and increased skeletal variations in rats at plasma exposures approximately 4 - and 6 - times respectively , the human plasma exposure at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 200 mg / day .
In female rats administered tedizolid phosphate during organogenesis through lactation , there was no evidence of fetal toxicity , developmental delays , or impaired reproduction in the offspring at plasma exposures approximately equivalent to the human plasma exposure at the MRHD ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In an embryo - fetal development study , tedizolid phosphate administered orally to pregnant mice at doses of 1 , 5 , and 25 mg / kg / day during organogenesis ( Gestational Day [ GD ] 6 to GD15 ) was associated with fetal developmental effects occurring in the absence of maternal toxicity , including reduced fetal weights and an increased incidence of costal cartilage anomalies at the high dose ( approximately 4 - times the human plasma exposure at the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison ) .
Tedizolid phosphate administered orally at doses of 2 . 5 , 5 , and 15 mg / kg / day to pregnant rats during organogenesis ( GD6 through GD17 ) was associated with maternal toxicity ( reduced maternal body weights ) , decreased fetal weights , and increased skeletal variations including reduced ossification of the sternebrae , vertebrae , and skull at the high dose of 15 mg / kg / day ( approximately 6 - times the human plasma exposure at the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison ) .
The doses not associated with fetal toxicity in mice and maternal and fetal toxicity in rats were 5 and 2 . 5 mg / kg / day respectively ( for both species approximately equivalent to the human plasma exposure at the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison ) .
In a pre - postnatal study , oral tedizolid phosphate administered to female rats at doses of 1 . 25 , 2 . 5 , and 3 . 75 mg / kg / day during gestation and lactation ( GD6 through Lactational Day 20 ) was not associated with maternal toxicity , fetal toxicity , developmental delays , or impaired reproduction at doses up to the high dose of 3 . 75 mg / kg / day ( approximately equivalent to the human plasma exposure at the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of tedizolid in human milk .
Tedizolid is present in rat milk .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
There are no data on the effects of SIVEXTRO on the breastfed child or on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for SIVEXTRO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from SIVEXTRO or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of SIVEXTRO for the treatment of ABSSSI have been established in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older .
Use of SIVEXTRO for the treatment of ABSSSI is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies in adults with additional pharmacokinetic and safety data in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
Safety and effectiveness of SIVEXTRO in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of SIVEXTRO did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
No overall differences in pharmacokinetics were observed between elderly subjects and younger subjects .
10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of overdosage , SIVEXTRO should be discontinued and general supportive treatment given .
Hemodialysis does not result in meaningful removal of tedizolid from systemic circulation .
11 DESCRIPTION SIVEXTRO ( tedizolid phosphate ) , a phosphate prodrug , is converted to tedizolid in the presence of phosphatases .
Tedizolid phosphate has the chemical name [ ( 5 R ) - ( 3 - { 3 - Fluoro - 4 - [ 6 - ( 2 - methyl - 2 H - tetrazol - 5 - yl ) pyridin - 3 - yl ] phenyl } - 2 - oxooxazolidin - 5 - yl ] methyl hydrogen phosphate .
Its empirical formula is C17H16FN6O6P and its molecular weight is 450 . 32 .
Its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Tedizolid phosphate is a white to yellow solid and is administered orally or by intravenous infusion .
The pharmacologically active moiety , tedizolid , is an antibacterial agent of the oxazolidinone class .
SIVEXTRO tablets contain 200 mg of tedizolid phosphate , and the following inactive ingredients : crospovidone , magnesium stearate , mannitol , microcrystalline cellulose , and povidone .
In addition , the film coating contains the following inactive ingredients : polyethylene glycol / macrogol , polyvinyl alcohol , talc , titanium dioxide , and yellow iron oxide .
SIVEXTRO for injection is a sterile , white to off - white sterile lyophilized powder supplied in a clear glass single - dose vial .
Each vial contains 200 mg of tedizolid phosphate and the inactive ingredient , mannitol ( 105 mg ) .
Sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid are used as needed for pH adjustment .
When reconstituted as directed with 4 mL of Sterile Water for Injection , each mL contains 50 mg of tedizolid phosphate .
The pH of the reconstituted solution is 7 . 4 to 8 . 1 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Tedizolid is an antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The AUC / minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) was shown to best correlate with tedizolid activity in animal infection models .
In the mouse thigh infection model of S . aureus , antistaphylococcal killing activity was impacted by the presence of granulocytes .
In granulocytopenic mice ( neutrophil count < 100 cells / mL ) , bacterial stasis was achieved at a human - equivalent dose of approximately 2000 mg / day ; whereas , in non - granulocytopenic animals , stasis was achieved at a human - equivalent dose of approximately 100 mg / day .
The safety and efficacy of SIVEXTRO for the treatment of neutropenic patients ( neutrophil counts < 1000 cells / mm3 ) have not been evaluated .
Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized , positive - and placebo - controlled crossover thorough QTc study , 48 enrolled subjects were administered a single oral dose of SIVEXTRO at a therapeutic dose of 200 mg , SIVEXTRO at a supratherapeutic dose of 1200 mg , placebo , and a positive control ; no significant effects of SIVEXTRO on heart rate , electrocardiogram morphology , PR , QRS , or QT interval were detected .
Therefore , SIVEXTRO does not affect cardiac repolarization .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Tedizolid phosphate is a prodrug that is converted by phosphatases to tedizolid , the microbiologically active moiety , following oral and intravenous administration .
Only the pharmacokinetic profile of tedizolid is discussed further due to negligible systemic exposure of tedizolid phosphate following oral and intravenous administration .
Following multiple once - daily oral or intravenous administration , steady state concentrations are achieved within approximately three days with tedizolid accumulation of approximately 30 % ( tedizolid half - life of approximately 12 hours ) .
Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameters of tedizolid following oral and intravenous administration of 200 mg once daily tedizolid phosphate are shown in Table 5 .
Table 5 : Mean ( Standard Deviation ) Tedizolid Pharmacokinetic Parameters Following Single and Multiple Oral and Intravenous Administration of 200 mg Once - Daily Tedizolid PhosphatePharmacokinetic Parameters of Tedizolid [ 1 ] Oral Intravenous Single Dose Steady State Single Dose Steady State Cmax ( mcg / mL ) 2 . 0 ( 0 . 7 ) 2 . 2 ( 0 . 6 ) 2 . 3 ( 0 . 6 ) 3 . 0 ( 0 . 7 ) Tmax ( hr ) [ 2 ] 2 . 5 ( 1 . 0 - 8 . 0 ) 3 . 5 ( 1 . 0 - 6 . 0 ) 1 . 1 ( 0 . 9 - 1 . 5 ) 1 . 2 ( 0 . 9 - 1 . 5 ) AUC ( mcg ∙ hr / mL ) [ 3 ] 23 . 8 ( 6 . 8 ) 25 . 6 ( 8 . 5 ) 26 . 6 ( 5 . 2 ) 29 . 2 ( 6 . 2 ) CL or CL / F ( L / hr ) 7 . 5 ( 2 . 3 ) 6 . 9 ( 1 . 7 ) 6 . 4 ( 1 . 2 ) 5 . 9 ( 1 . 4 ) [ 1 ] Cmax , maximum concentration ; Tmax , time to reach Cmax ; AUC , area under the concentration - time curve ; CL , systemic clearance ; CL / F , apparent oral clearance [ 2 ] Median ( range ) [ 3 ] AUC is AUC0 - ∞ ( AUC from time 0 to infinity ) for single - dose administration and AUC0 - 24 ( AUC from time 0 to 24 hours ) for multiple - dose administration Absorption Peak plasma tedizolid concentrations are achieved within approximately 3 hours following oral administration under fasting conditions or at the end of the 1 hour intravenous infusion of tedizolid phosphate .
The absolute bioavailability is approximately 91 % and no dosage adjustment is necessary between intravenous and oral administration .
Tedizolid phosphate ( oral ) may be administered with or without food as total systemic exposure ( AUC0 - ∞ ) is unchanged between fasted and fed ( high - fat , high - calorie ) conditions .
Distribution Protein binding of tedizolid to human plasma proteins is approximately 70 to 90 % .
The mean steady state volume of distribution of tedizolid in healthy adults following a single intravenous dose of tedizolid phosphate 200 mg ranged from 67 to 80 L ( approximately twice total body water ) .
Tedizolid penetrates into the interstitial space fluid of adipose and skeletal muscle tissue with exposure similar to free drug exposure in plasma .
Elimination Metabolism Other than tedizolid , which accounts for approximately 95 % of the total radiocarbon AUC in plasma , there are no other significant circulating metabolites in humans .
There was no degradation of tedizolid in human liver microsomes indicating tedizolid is unlikely to be a substrate for hepatic CYP450 enzymes .
In vitro studies showed that conjugation of tedizolid is mediated via multiple sulfotransferase ( SULT ) isoforms ( SULT1A1 , SULT1A2 , and SULT2A1 ) .
Excretion Following single oral administration of 14 C - labeled tedizolid phosphate under fasted conditions , the majority of elimination occurred via the liver , with 82 % of the radioactive dose recovered in feces and 18 % in urine , primarily as a non - circulating and microbiologically inactive sulfate conjugate .
Most of the elimination of tedizolid ( > 85 % ) occurs within 96 hours .
Less than 3 % of the tedizolid phosphate - administered dose is excreted in feces and urine as unchanged tedizolid .
Specific Populations Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis , there are no clinically relevant demographic or clinical patient factors ( including age , gender , race , ethnicity , weight , body mass index , and measures of renal or liver function ) that impact the pharmacokinetics of tedizolid .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following administration of a single 200 mg oral dose of SIVEXTRO , no clinically meaningful changes in mean tedizolid Cmax and AUC0 - ∞ were observed in adult patients with moderate ( n = 8 ) or severe ( n = 8 ) hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class B and C ) compared to 8 matched healthy control subjects .
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with hepatic impairment .
Patients with Renal Impairment Following administration of a single 200 mg intravenous dose of SIVEXTRO to 8 adult subjects with severe renal impairment defined as eGFR < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 , the Cmax was essentially unchanged and AUC0 - ∞ was decreased by less than 10 % compared to 8 matched healthy control adult subjects .
Hemodialysis does not result in meaningful removal of tedizolid from systemic circulation , as assessed in subjects with end - stage renal disease ( eGFR < 15 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) .
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment or patients on hemodialysis .
Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of tedizolid were evaluated in a Phase 1 study conducted in elderly healthy volunteers ( age 65 years and older , with at least 5 subjects at least 75 years old ; n = 14 ) compared to younger control subjects ( 25 to 45 years old ; n = 14 ) following administration of a single oral dose of SIVEXTRO 200 mg .
There were no clinically meaningful differences in tedizolid Cmax and AUC0 - ∞ between elderly subjects and younger control subjects .
No dosage adjustment of SIVEXTRO is necessary in elderly patients .
Male and Female Patients The impact of gender on the pharmacokinetics of SIVEXTRO was evaluated in clinical trials of adult healthy males and females and in a population pharmacokinetics analysis .
The pharmacokinetics of tedizolid were similar in males and females .
No dosage adjustment of SIVEXTRO is necessary based on gender .
Pediatric Patients Compared to adult patients , tedizolid exposures are higher in pediatric patients 12 to < 18 years of age following multiple dose administration of IV or oral SIVEXTRO ( geometric mean Cmax 3 . 13 vs . 2 . 00 mcg / mL , AUC24h 28 . 6 vs . 21 . 0 mcg * h / mL ) ; however , this increase in exposure is not considered clinically significant .
Drug Interaction Studies Drug Metabolizing Enzymes Transformation via Phase 1 hepatic oxidative metabolism is not a significant pathway for elimination of SIVEXTRO .
Neither SIVEXTRO nor tedizolid detectably inhibited or induced the metabolism of selected CYP enzyme substrates , suggesting that drug - drug interactions based on oxidative metabolism are unlikely .
Membrane Transporters The potential for tedizolid or tedizolid phosphate to inhibit transport of probe substrates of important drug uptake ( OAT1 , OAT3 , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OCT1 , and OCT2 ) and efflux transporters ( P - gp and BCRP ) was tested in vitro .
No clinically relevant interactions are expected to occur with these transporters except BCRP .
Coadministration of multiple oral doses of SIVEXTRO ( 200 mg once daily ) increased the Cmax and AUC of rosuvastatin ( 10 mg single oral dose ) , a known BCRP substrate , by approximately 55 % and 70 % , respectively , in healthy adult subjects [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibition Tedizolid is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) in vitro .
The interaction with MAO inhibitors could not be evaluated in Phase 2 and 3 trials , as subjects taking such medications were excluded from the trials .
Adrenergic Agents Two placebo - controlled crossover studies were conducted to assess the potential of 200 mg oral SIVEXTRO at steady state to enhance pressor responses to pseudoephedrine and tyramine in healthy adults .
No meaningful changes in blood pressure or heart rate were seen with pseudoephedrine .
The median tyramine dose required to cause an increase in systolic blood pressure of ≥ 30 mmHg from pre - dose baseline was 325 mg with SIVEXTRO compared to 425 mg with placebo .
Palpitations were reported in 21 / 29 ( 72 . 4 % ) adult subjects exposed to SIVEXTRO compared to 13 / 28 ( 46 . 4 % ) exposed to placebo in the tyramine challenge study .
Serotonergic Agents Serotonergic effects at doses of tedizolid phosphate up to 30 - fold above the human equivalent dose did not differ from vehicle control in a mouse model that predicts serotonergic activity .
In Phase 3 trials , subjects taking serotonergic agents including antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , tricyclic antidepressants , and serotonin 5 - hydroxytryptamine ( 5 - HT1 ) receptor agonists ( triptans ) , meperidine , or buspirone were excluded .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The antibacterial activity of tedizolid is mediated by binding to the 50 S subunit of the bacterial ribosome resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis .
Tedizolid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis through a mechanism of action different from that of other non - oxazolidinone class antibacterial drugs ; therefore , cross - resistance between tedizolid and other classes of antibacterial drugs is unlikely .
The results of in vitro time - kill studies show that tedizolid is bacteriostatic against enterococci , staphylococci , and streptococci .
Resistance Organisms resistant to oxazolidinones via mutations in chromosomal genes encoding 23 S rRNA or ribosomal proteins ( L3 and L4 ) are generally cross - resistant to tedizolid .
In the limited number of Staphylococcus aureus strains tested , the presence of the chloramphenicol - florfenicol resistance ( cfr ) gene did not result in resistance to tedizolid in the absence of chromosomal mutations .
Mutations in 23 SrRNA ( G2576T mutation ) have been associated with tedizolid resistance in S . aureus isolates .
Spontaneous mutations conferring reduced susceptibility to tedizolid occur in vitro at a frequency rate of approximately 10 - 10 .
Interaction with Other Antimicrobial Drugs In vitro drug combination studies with tedizolid and aztreonam , ceftriaxone , ceftazidime , imipenem , rifampin , trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole , minocycline , clindamycin , ciprofloxacin , daptomycin , vancomycin , gentamicin , amphotericin B , ketoconazole , and terbinafine demonstrate neither synergy nor antagonism .
Antimicrobial Activity Tedizolid has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria , both in vitro and in clinical infections , as described in Indications and Usage ( 1 ) .
Aerobic bacteria • Gram - positive bacteria • Staphylococcus aureus ( including methicillin - resistant [ MRSA ] and methicillin - susceptible [ MSSA ] isolates ) • Streptococcus pyogenes • Streptococcus agalactiae • Streptococcus anginosus Group ( including S . anginosus , S . intermedius , and S . constellatus ) • Enterococcus faecalis The following in vitro data are available , but their clinical significance is unknown .
At least 90 % of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for tedizolid against isolates of similar genus or organism group .
However , the efficacy of SIVEXTRO in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well - controlled clinical trials .
Aerobic bacteria Gram - positive bacteria • Staphylococcus epidermidis ( including methicillin - susceptible and methicillin - resistant isolates ) • Staphylococcus haemolyticus • Staphylococcus lugdunensis • Enterococcus faecium Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug , please see : https : / / www . fda . gov / STIC 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity Long - term carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with tedizolid phosphate .
Mutagenesis Tedizolid phosphate was negative for genotoxicity in all in vitro assays ( bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) , Chinese hamster lung ( CHL ) cell chromosomal aberration ) and in all in vivo tests ( mouse bone marrow micronucleus , rat liver unscheduled DNA synthesis ) .
Tedizolid , generated from tedizolid phosphate after metabolic activation ( in vitro and in vivo ) , was also tested for genotoxicity .
Tedizolid was positive in an in vitro CHL cell chromosomal aberration assay , but negative for genotoxicity in other in vitro assays ( Ames , mouse lymphoma mutagenicity ) and in vivo in a mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay .
Impairment of Fertility In a fertility study , oral tedizolid phosphate administered in doses of 5 , 15 , and 50 mg / kg / day for 28 days before mating and during mating to male rats had no adverse effects on the fertility or reproductive performance , including spermatogenesis , at the maximum tested dose ( 50 mg / kg / day ) with a plasma tedizolid AUC approximately 5 - fold greater than the plasma AUC value in humans at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) .
Tedizolid phosphate administered in doses of 2 . 5 , 5 , and 15 mg / kg / day for 14 days before mating , during mating , and until Gestation Day ( GD ) 7 to female rats also had no adverse effects on the fertility or reproductive performance at doses up to the maximum tested dose of 15 mg / kg / day ( approximately 4 - fold higher than exposures in humans at the MRHD based on plasma AUC comparison ) .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Repeated - oral and intravenous dosing of tedizolid phosphate in rats in 1 - month and 3 - month toxicology studies produced dose - and time - dependent bone marrow hypocellularity ( myeloid , erythroid , and megakaryocyte ) , with associated reduction in circulating RBCs , WBCs , and platelets .
These effects showed evidence of reversibility and occurred at plasma tedizolid exposure levels ( AUC ) ≥ 6 - fold greater than the plasma exposure associated with the human therapeutic dose .
In a 1 - month immunotoxicology study in rats , repeated oral dosing of tedizolid phosphate was shown to significantly reduce splenic B cells and T cells and reduce plasma IgG titers .
These effects occurred at plasma tedizolid exposure levels ( AUC ) ≥ 3 - fold greater than the expected human plasma exposure associated with the therapeutic dose .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections Adults A total of 1333 adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections ( ABSSSI ) were randomized in two multicenter , multinational , double - blind , non - inferiority trials .

Pediatric Patients The safety and efficacy of SIVEXTRO in pediatric patients 12 to < 18 years of age were investigated in a randomized , single blind , active - controlled trial of 120 patients with clinically documented ABSSSI ( 91 receiving tedizolid , 29 receiving comparator ) .
Patients were randomized in a 3 : 1 ratio with stratification by geographic region to receive SIVEXTRO IV and / or oral therapy , dosed 200 mg once daily for 6 days , or comparator IV and / or oral therapy , dosed over 10 days .
Comparator therapy was selected by the investigator from a list of 5 IV and 4 oral comparators per local standard of care .
The most frequently used comparators were cefazolin ( 11 patients ) and vancomycin ( 8 patients ) .
The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SIVEXTRO .
The trial was not powered for comparative inferential efficacy analysis .
Clinical response at the test of cure visit ( Day 18 - 25 ) was assessed by a blinded investigator in the ITT population ( all randomized patients ) .
Clinical successes were required to have resolution or near resolution of all related signs and symptoms such that no further antibacterial therapy was needed .
Early clinical response , defined as at least a 20 % reduction in lesion size at 48 - 72 hours after start of treatment , was also assessed in the ITT population .
Clinical success at test of cure was 96 . 7 % ( 88 / 91 ) in the tedizolid group and 93 . 1 % ( 27 / 29 ) in the comparator group ( difference 3 . 6 % , 95 % CI : - 6 . 3 , 13 . 5 ) .
Early clinical response at 48 - 72 hours was 92 . 3 % ( 84 / 91 ) in the tedizolid group and 96 . 6 % ( 28 / 29 ) in the comparator group ( difference - 4 . 2 % , 95 % CI : - 12 . 9 , 4 . 4 ) .
