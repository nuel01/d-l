5 . 1 New Primary Malignancies Cutaneous Malignancies Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma , keratoacanthoma , and melanoma occurred at a higher incidence in patients receiving ZELBORAF compared to those in the control arm in Trial 1 .
The incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas ( cuSCC ) and keratoacanthomas in the ZELBORAF arm was 24 % compared to < 1 % in the dacarbazine arm [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The median time to the first appearance of cuSCC was 7 to 8 weeks ; approximately 33 % of patients who developed a cuSCC while receiving ZELBORAF experienced at least one additional occurrence with median time between occurrences of 6 weeks .
Potential risk factors associated with cuSCC observed in clinical studies using ZELBORAF included age ( ≥ 65 years ) , prior skin cancer , and chronic sun exposure .
In Trial 4 , in patients with ECD , the incidence of cuSCC and / or keratoacanthomas was 40 . 9 % ( 9 / 22 ) .
The median time to first appearance of cuSCC amongst patients with at least one occurrence was 12 . 1 weeks .
In Trial 1 , in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma , new primary malignant melanoma occurred in 2 . 1 % ( 7 / 336 ) of patients receiving ZELBORAF compared to none of the patients receiving dacarbazine .
Perform dermatologic evaluations prior to initiation of therapy and every 2 months while on therapy .
Manage suspicious skin lesions with excision and dermatopathologic evaluation .
Consider dermatologic monitoring for 6 months following discontinuation of ZELBORAF .
Non - Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma Non - cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas ( non - cuSCC ) of the head and neck can occur in patients receiving ZELBORAF [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Avoid concomitant administration of ZELBORAF with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers .
( 7 . 1 ) • CYP1A2 Substrates : ZELBORAF can increase concentrations of CYP1A2 substrates .
Avoid concomitant use of ZELBORAF with CYP1A2 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window .
If coadministration cannot be avoided , monitor closely for toxicities and consider dose reduction of CYP1A2 substrates .
( 7 . 2 ) .
7 . 1 Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors or Inducers on Vemurafenib Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increased vemurafenib plasma concentrations and may lead to increased toxicity .
Avoid coadministration of ZELBORAF with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors .
If coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is unavoidable , consider dose reduction of ZELBORAF , if clinically indicated .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Coadministration of ZELBORAF with rifampin , a strong CYP3A4 inducer , decreased vemurafenib plasma concentrations and may result in decreased efficacy .
Avoid coadministration of ZELBORAF with strong CYP3A4 inducers ( e . g . , phenytoin , carbamazepine , rifampin ) , and replace these drugs with alternative drugs when possible .
If coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer is unavoidable , increase the dose of ZELBORAF by 240 mg ( one tablet ) as tolerated [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Effect of Vemurafenib on CYP1A2 Substrates Coadministration of ZELBORAF with tizanidine , a sensitive CYP1A2 substrate , increased tizanidine systemic exposure by 4 . 7 - fold .
Avoid concomitant use of ZELBORAF with drugs having a narrow therapeutic window that are predominantly metabolized by CYP1A2 [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
If coadministration cannot be avoided , monitor closely for toxicities and consider a dose reduction of concomitant CYP1A2 substrates .
7 . 3 Concurrent Ipilimumab Increases in transaminases and bilirubin occurred in a majority of patients who received concurrent ipilimumab and ZELBORAF [ see Warnings and Precautions Section 5 . 6 ] .
7 . 4 Effect of Vemurafenib on P - gp Substrates Coadministration of ZELBORAF with digoxin , a sensitive P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) substrate , increased digoxin systemic exposure by 1 . 8 - fold .
Avoid concurrent use of P - gp substrates known to have narrow therapeutic indices .
If use of these medications is unavoidable , consider dose reduction of P - gp substrates with narrow therapeutic indices .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Do not breastfeed while taking ZELBORAF .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action , ZELBORAF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data on the use of ZELBORAF in pregnant women to determine the drug - associated risk ; however , placental transfer of vemurafenib to a fetus has been reported .
Exposure to vemurafenib could not be achieved in animals at levels sufficient to fully address its potential toxicity in pregnant women .
Advise pregnant women of the potential harm to a fetus .
The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population ( s ) are unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Vemurafenib showed no evidence of developmental toxicity in rat fetuses at doses up to 250 mg / kg / day ( approximately 1 . 3 times the clinical exposure at 960 mg twice daily based on AUC ) or rabbit fetuses at doses up to 450 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 6 times the clinical exposure at 960 mg twice daily based on AUC ) .
Fetal drug levels were 3 – 5 % of maternal levels , indicating that vemurafenib has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus .
8 . 2 Lactation There is no information available regarding the presence of vemurafenib in human milk , effects on the breastfed infant , or effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant , including malignancy , severe dermatologic reactions , QT prolongation , hepatotoxicity , photosensitivity , and ophthalmologic toxicity , [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ] , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ZELBORAF and for 2 weeks after the final dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Based on its mechanism of action , ZELBORAF can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ZELBORAF and for 2 weeks after the final dose .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ZELBORAF in pediatric patients have not been established .
Vemurafenib was studied in 6 adolescent patients 15 to 17 years of age with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600 mutation .
A maximum tolerated dose was not reached with doses up to vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily .
No new safety signals were observed .
Vemurafenib steady - state exposure in these 6 adolescent patients was generally similar to that in adults .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ZELBORAF did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment No formal clinical study has been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib .

11 DESCRIPTION ZELBORAF ( vemurafenib ) is a kinase inhibitor available as 240 mg tablets for oral use .
Vemurafenib has the chemical name propane - 1 - sulfonic acid { 3 - [ 5 - ( 4 - chlorophenyl ) - 1 H - pyrrolo [ 2 , 3 - b ] pyridine - 3 - carbonyl ] - 2 , 4 - difluoro - phenyl } - amide .
It has the molecular formula C23H18ClF2N3O3S and a molecular weight of 489 . 9 .
Vemurafenib has the following chemical structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Vemurafenib is a white to off - white crystalline solid .
It is practically insoluble in aqueous media .
Tablets of ZELBORAF are for oral administration .
Each tablet contains 240 mg of vemurafenib .
The inactive ingredients of ZELBORAF are : Tablet core : hypromellose acetate succinate , croscarmellose sodium , colloidal silicon dioxide , magnesium stearate , and hydroxypropyl cellulose .
Coating : pinkish white : poly ( vinyl alcohol ) , titanium dioxide , polyethylene glycol 3350 , talc , and iron oxide red .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Vemurafenib is a low molecular weight , orally available inhibitor of some mutated forms of BRAF serine - threonine kinase , including BRAF V600E .
Vemurafenib also inhibits other kinases in vitro such as CRAF , ARAF , wild - type BRAF , SRMS , ACK1 , MAP4K5 , and FGR at similar concentrations .
Some mutations in the BRAF gene including V600E result in constitutively activated BRAF proteins , which can cause cell proliferation in the absence of growth factors that would normally be required for proliferation .
Vemurafenib has anti - tumor effects in cellular and animal models of melanomas with mutated BRAF V600E .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology In a multi - center , open - label , single - arm study in 132 patients with BRAF V600E mutation - positive metastatic melanoma , patients administered vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily did not experience large changes in mean QTc interval ( i . e . , > 20 ms ) from baseline .
Vemurafenib is associated with concentration - dependent QTc interval prolongation .
The largest mean change from baseline in the first month of treatment occurred at 2 hours post - dose on Day 15 — an increase of 12 . 8 ms ( upper boundary of the two - sided 90 % confidence interval of 14 . 9 ms ) .
In the first 6 months of treatment , the largest observed mean change from baseline occurred at a pre - dose time point — an increase of 15 . 1 ms ( upper boundary of the two - sided 90 % confidence interval of 17 . 7 ms ) .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib were determined in patients with BRAF mutation - positive metastatic melanoma following 15 days of 960 mg twice daily with dosing approximately 12 hours apart .
The population pharmacokinetic analysis pooled data from 458 patients .
At steady - state , vemurafenib exhibits linear pharmacokinetics within the 240 mg to 960 mg dose range .
Absorption The mean bioavailability of vemurafenib at steady state was 64 % ( 56 % CV ) .
The median time to reach maximum plasma vemurafenib concentration ( Tmax ) was 3 hours following multiple doses .
The mean ( ± SD ) Cmax and AUC0 - 12 were 62 ± 17 µg / mL and 601 ± 170 µg * h / mL , respectively .
The median accumulation ratio estimate from the population pharmacokinetic analysis for the twice daily regimen is 7 . 4 , with steady - state achieved at approximately 15 to 22 days .
In clinical trials , vemurafenib was administered without regard to food .
A food effect study has demonstrated that a single dose of vemurafenib administered with a high - fat meal increased AUC by approximately 5 - fold , increased Cmax by 2 . 5 - fold , and delayed Tmax by approximately 4 hours as compared to the fasted state .
QTc prolongation may occur with increased exposures as vemurafenib is associated with concentration - dependent QTc interval prolongation [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Distribution Vemurafenib is highly bound ( > 99 % ) to human albumin and alpha - 1 acid glycoprotein plasma proteins .
The population apparent volume of distribution is estimated to be 106 L ( with 66 % inter - patient variability ) .
Metabolism Following oral administration of 960 mg of 14 C - vemurafenib , mean data showed that vemurafenib and its metabolites represented 95 % and 5 % of the components in plasma over 48 hours , respectively .
Elimination Following oral administration of 960 mg of 14 C - vemurafenib , approximately 94 % of the radioactive dose was recovered in feces and approximately 1 % was recovered in the urine .
The population apparent clearance is estimated to be 31 L / day ( with 32 % inter - patient variability ) .
The median elimination half - life estimate for vemurafenib is 57 hours ( the 5 th and 95 th percentile range is 30 to 120 hours ) .
Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib were examined in patients with metastatic melanoma enrolled in the clinical trials with normal hepatic function ( n = 158 , total bilirubin ≤ ULN ) and mild ( n = 58 , total bilirubin 1 . 0 – 1 . 5 × ULN ) , moderate ( n = 27 , total bilirubin 1 . 5 – 3 × ULN ) , or severe ( n = 3 , total bilirubin > 3 × ULN ) hepatic impairment .
Patients received vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily .
The apparent clearance of vemurafenib in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment was similar to that in patients with normal hepatic function .
The appropriate dose for patients with severe hepatic impairment cannot be determined as clinical and pharmacokinetic data were available for only three patients [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Renal Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib were examined in patients with metastatic melanoma enrolled in the clinical trials with normal renal function ( CLcr ≥ 90 mL / min ) and mild ( n = 94 , CLcr > 60 to 89 mL / min ) , moderate ( n = 11 , CLcr 30 to 59 mL / min ) or severe ( n = 1 , CLcr < 29 mL / min ) renal impairment .
Patients received vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily .
The apparent clearance of vemurafenib in patients with mild and moderate renal impairment was similar to that in patients with normal renal function .
The appropriate dose for patients with severe renal impairment cannot be determined as clinical and pharmacokinetic data were available for only one patient [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Age , Body Weight , Sex , and Race : Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis , age , body weight , and sex do not have a clinically important effect on the exposure of vemurafenib .
There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the pharmacokinetics of vemurafenib by race .
Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors : Coadministration of 960 mg ZELBORAF twice daily with once daily doses of 200 mg itraconazole , a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor , increased steady state vemurafenib AUC0 - τ by 40 % ( 90 % CI : 21 % , 61 % ) with a similar magnitude of increase in Cmax [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers : Coadministration of 600 mg daily doses of rifampin ( a strong CYP3A inducer ) with a single 960 mg dose of ZELBORAF decreased vemurafenib AUC by 40 % ( 90 % CI : 24 % , 53 % ) with no effect on Cmax , relative to a 960 mg dose of ZELBORAF administered alone [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Effect of Vemurafenib on CYP Substrates : In vitro studies suggest that vemurafenib is an inhibitor of CYP1A2 , 2A6 , 2B6 , 2C8 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , and 3A4 / 5 .
Coadministration of tizanidine 2 mg ( a sensitive CYP1A2 substrate ) on day 21 with vemurafenib which was administered 960 mg twice daily for 21 days increased tizanidine AUCinf by 4 . 7 - fold ( 90 % CI : 3 . 6 , 6 . 3 ) and Cmax by 2 . 2 - fold ( 90 % CI : 1 . 7 , 2 . 7 ) in 16 cancer patients [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
In an in vivo phenotypic cocktail drug - drug interaction study in patients with cancer , a single dose of the CYP probe substrate cocktail ( for CYP1A2 , 2D6 , 3A4 , 2C19 and 2C9 ) was administered before and concomitantly with vemurafenib ( following 15 days of dosing at 960 mg twice daily ) .
Coadministration of vemurafenib increased the mean AUC of caffeine ( CYP1A2 substrate ) by 2 . 6 - fold [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Coadministration of vemurafenib increased the mean AUC of dextromethorphan ( CYP2D6 substrate ) by 47 % and the AUC of S - warfarin ( CYP2C9 substrate ) by 18 % , while it decreased the mean AUC of midazolam ( CYP3A4 substrate ) by 39 % .
Coadministration of vemurafenib did not change the mean systemic exposure to omeprazole ( CYP2C19 substrate ) .
Effect of Vemurafenib on Transporters : In vitro studies suggest that vemurafenib is both a substrate and an inhibitor of the efflux transporters P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein ( BCRP ) .
Administration of vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily for 22 days increased digoxin AUC by 1 . 8 - fold ( 90 % CI : 1 . 6 , 2 . 0 ) and Cmax by 1 . 5 - fold ( 90 % CI : 1 . 3 , 1 . 7 ) in 26 cancer patients who were coadministered a single dose of digoxin 0 . 25 mg ( sensitive P - gp substrate ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility There have been no formal studies conducted assessing the carcinogenic potential of vemurafenib .
ZELBORAF increased the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas in patients in clinical trials .
Vemurafenib did not cause genetic damage when tested in in vitro assays ( bacterial mutation [ AMES Assay ] , human lymphocyte chromosome aberration ) or in the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus test .
No specific studies with vemurafenib have been conducted in animals to evaluate the effect on fertility ; nevertheless , no histopathological findings were noted in reproductive organs in males and females in repeat - dose toxicology studies in rats at doses up to 450 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 6 and 1 . 6 times the human exposure based on AUC in males and females , respectively ) and dogs at doses up to 450 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 3 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC in both males and females , respectively ) .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Consistent with the increased incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas in patients treated with vemurafenib , the treatment of mice implanted with human cuSCC cells with vemurafenib caused a dose - dependent acceleration of the growth of the implanted tumors .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Treatment - Naïve Patients with BRAF V600E Mutation - Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma Trial 1 , an international , open - label , randomized controlled trial , equally allocated 675 patients with treatment - naive , BRAF V600E mutation - positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma , as detected by the cobas ® 4800 BRAF V600 Mutation Test , to receive ZELBORAF 960 mg by mouth twice daily ( n = 337 ) or dacarbazine 1000 mg / m2 intravenously on Day 1 every 3 weeks ( n = 338 ) .
