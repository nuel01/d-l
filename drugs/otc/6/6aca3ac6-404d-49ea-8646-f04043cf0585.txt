( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypersensitivity Reactions : Life - threatening or fatal reactions can occur .
Always have emergency equipment and trained personnel available .
( 5 . 2 ) • Contrast - Induced Acute Kidney Injury : Acute injury including renal failure can occur .
Minimize dose and maintain adequate hydration to minimize risk .
( 5 . 3 ) • Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions : Hemodynamic disturbances including shock and cardiac arrest may occur during or after administration .
( 5 . 4 ) • Thyroid Dysfunction in Pediatric Patients 0 to 3 Years of Age : Monitor these patients for thyroid function abnormalities and treat as clinically needed .
( 5 . 8 ) 5 . 1 Risks Associated with Inadvertent Intrathecal Administration Iodixanol is for intravascular use only and is contraindicated for intrathecal use [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Inadvertent Intrathecal administration can cause death , convulsions / seizures , cerebral hemorrhage , coma , paralysis , arachnoiditis , acute renal failure , cardiac arrest , rhabdomyolysis , hyperthermia , and brain edema .
5 . 2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Iodixanol can cause life - threatening or fatal hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis .
Manifestations include respiratory arrest , laryngospasm , bronchospasm , angioedema , and shock .
Most severe reactions develop shortly after the start of the injection ( within 3 minutes ) , but reactions can occur up to hours later .
There is an increased risk in patients with a history of a previous reaction to contrast agent , and known allergies ( i . e . , bronchial asthma , drug , or food allergies ) or other hypersensitivities .
Premedication with antihistamines or corticosteroids does not prevent serious life - threatening reactions , but may reduce both their incidence and severity .
Obtain a history of allergy , hypersensitivity , or hypersensitivity reactions to iodinated contrast agents and always have emergency resuscitation equipment and trained personnel available prior to iodixanol administration .
Monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions .
5 . 3 Contrast - Induced Acute Kidney Injury Acute kidney injury , including renal failure , may occur after iodixanol administration .
Risk factors include : pre - existing renal impairment , dehydration , diabetes mellitus , congestive heart failure , advanced vascular disease , elderly age , concomitant use of nephrotoxic or diuretic medications , multiple myeloma / paraproteinaceous diseases , repetitive and / or large doses of an iodinated contrast agent .
Use the lowest necessary dose of iodixanol in patients with renal impairment .
Adequately hydrate patients prior to and following iodixanol administration .
Do not use laxatives , diuretics , or preparatory dehydration prior to iodixanol administration .
5 . 4 Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions Life - threatening or fatal cardiovascular reactions including hypotension , shock , cardiac arrest have occurred with the use of iodixanol .
Most deaths occur during injection or five to ten minutes later , with cardiovascular disease as the main aggravating factor .
Cardiac decompensation , serious arrhythmias , and myocardial ischemia or infarction can occur during coronary arteriography and ventriculography .
Based upon clinical literature reported deaths from the administration of iodinated contrast agents range from 6 . 6 per million ( 0 . 00066 % ) to 1 in 10 , 000 ( 0 . 01 % ) .
Use the lowest necessary dose of iodixanol in patients with congestive heart failure and always have emergency resuscitation equipment and trained personnel available .
Monitor all patients for severe cardiovascular reactions .
5 . 5 Thromboembolic Events Angiocardiography Serious , rarely fatal , thromboembolic events causing myocardial infarction and stroke can occur during angiocardiography procedures with both ionic and nonionic contrast media .
During these procedures , increased thrombosis and activation of the complement system occurs .
Risk factors for thromboembolic events include : length of procedure , catheter and syringe material , underlying disease state , and concomitant medications .
To minimize thromboembolic events , use meticulous angiographic techniques , and minimize the length of the procedure .
Avoid blood remaining in contact with syringes containing iodinated contrast agents , which increases the risk of clotting .
Avoid angiocardiography in patients with homocystinuria because of the risk of inducing thrombosis and embolism .
5 . 6 Extravasation and Injection Site Reactions Extravasation of iodixanol injection may cause tissue necrosis and / or compartment syndrome , particularly in patients with severe arterial or venous disease .
Ensure intravascular placement of catheters prior to injection .
Monitor patients for extravasation and advise patients to seek medical care for progression of symptoms .
5 . 7 Thyroid Storm in Patients with Hyperthyroidism Thyroid storm has occurred after the intravascular use of iodinated contrast agents in patients with hyperthyroidism , or with an autonomously functioning thyroid nodule .
Evaluate the risk in such patients before use of iodixanol .
5 . 8 Thyroid Dysfunction in Pediatric Patients 0 to 3 Years of Age Thyroid dysfunction characterized by hypothyroidism or transient thyroid suppression has been reported after both single exposure and multiple exposures to iodinated contrast media .
Among patients 0 to 3 years of age exposed to iodinated contrast media , thyroid dysfunction has been reported in 1 % to 15 % depending on the age of the patient and the dose of the iodinated contrast agent .
Younger age , very low birth weight , prematurity , and the presence of other conditions , such as , admission to neonatal or pediatric intensive care units , and cardiac conditions are associated with an increased risk .
Pediatric patients with cardiac conditions may be at the greatest risk given that they often require high doses of contrast during invasive cardiac procedures , such as catheterization and computed tomography ( CT ) .
Pediatric patients 0 to 3 years of age warrant closer monitoring because an underactive thyroid during early life may be harmful for motor , hearing , and cognitive development and may require transient T4 replacement therapy .
Evaluate thyroid function in all pediatric patients 0 to 3 years of age within 3 weeks following exposure to iodinated contrast media , especially in term and preterm neonates .
If thyroid dysfunction is detected , treat and monitor thyroid function as clinically needed .
5 . 9 Hypertensive Crisis in Patients with Pheochromocytoma Hypertensive crisis has occurred after the use of iodinated contrast agents in patient with pheochromocytoma .
Monitor patients when administering iodixanol if pheochromocytoma or catecholamine - secreting paragangliomas are suspected .
Inject the minimum amount of contrast necessary , assess the blood pressure throughout the procedure , and have measures for treatment of a hypertensive crisis readily available .
5 . 10 Sickle Cell Crisis in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease Iodinated contrast agents when administered intravascularly may promote sickling in individuals who are homozygous for sickle cell disease .
Hydrate patients prior to and following iodixanol administration and use iodixanol only if the necessary imaging information cannot be obtained with alternative imaging modalities .
5 . 11 Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reactions Severe cutaneous adverse reactions ( SCAR ) may develop from 1 hour to several weeks after intravascular contrast agent administration .
These reactions include Stevens - Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( SJS / TEN ) , acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis ( AGEP ) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) .
Reaction severity may increase and time to onset may decrease with repeat administration of contrast agents ; prophylactic medications may not prevent or mitigate severe cutaneous adverse reactions .
Avoid administering iodixanol to patients with a history of a severe cutaneous adverse reaction to iodixanol .

Additional safety data was obtained in studies of iodixanol in 459 pediatric patients .
A total of 26 patients ranged in age from birth to < 29 days , 148 ranged from 29 days to 2 years , 263 from 2 to < 12 years , and 22 from 12 to 18 years .
A total of 252 ( 55 % ) of the patients were male .
The racial distribution was : Caucasian - 81 % , Black - 14 % , Oriental - 2 % , and other or unknown - 4 % .
The proportion of patients undergoing an intra - arterial procedure by age was : 92 % ( < 29 days ) , 55 % ( 29 days to 6 months ) , and 29 % ( > 6 months ) .
In these studies , adverse events were numerically higher in pediatric patients less than one year of age compared to older pediatric patients .
In pediatric patients who received intravenous injections of iodixanol for computerized tomography or excretory urography , a concentration of 270 mg Iodine / mL was used in 144 patients , and a concentration of 320 mg Iodine / mL in 154 patients .
All patients received one intravenous injection of 1 mL / kg to 2 mL / kg .
In pediatric patients who received intra - arterial and intracardiac studies , a concentration of 320 mg Iodine / mL was used in 161 patients .
Twenty - two patients were < 29 days of age ; 78 were 29 days to 2 years of age ; and 61 were over 2 years .
Most of these pediatric patients received initial volumes of 1 mL / kg to 2 mL / kg and most patients received a maximum of 3 injections .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Drug - Drug Interactions • Metformin In patients with renal impairment , metformin can cause lactic acidosis .
Iodinated contrast agents appear to increase the risk of metformin - induced lactic acidosis , possibly as a result of worsening renal function .
Stop metformin at the time of , or prior to , iodixanol administration in patients with an eGFR between 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 and 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment , alcoholism or heart failure ; or in patients who will be administered intra - arterial iodinated contrast .
Re - evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure , and reinstitute metformin only after renal function is stable .
• Radioactive Iodine Administration of iodinated contrast agents may interfere with thyroid uptake of radioactive iodine ( I - 131 and I - 123 ) and decrease therapeutic and diagnostic efficacy in patients with carcinoma of the thyroid .
The decrease in efficacy lasts for 6 to 8 weeks .
• Beta - adrenergic Blocking Agents The use of beta - adrenergic blocking agents lowers the threshold for and increases the severity of contrast reactions , and reduces the responsiveness of treatment of hypersensitivity reactions with epinephrine .
Because of the risk of hypersensitivity reactions , use caution when administering iodixanol to patients taking beta - blockers .
• Oral Cholecystographic Contrast Agents Renal toxicity has been reported in patients with liver dysfunction who were given an oral cholecystographic agent followed by intravascular iodinated contrast agents .
Postpone the administration of iodixanol in patients who have recently received an oral cholecystographic contrast agent .
7 . 2 Drug Laboratory Test Interactions • Effect on Thyroid Tests The results of protein bound iodine and radioactive iodine uptake studies , which depend on iodine estimation , will not accurately reflect thyroid function for at least 16 days following administration of iodinated contrast agents .
However , thyroid function tests which do not depend on iodine estimations ( e . g . , T3 resin uptake and total or free thyroxine T4 assays ) are not affected .
• Effect on Urine Tests As reported with other contrast agents , iodixanol may produce a false - positive result for protein in the urine using urine dip tests .
However , the Coomassie blue method has been shown to give accurate results for the measurement of urine protein in the presence of iodixanol .
In addition , care should be used in interpreting the results of urine specific gravity measurements in the presence of high levels of iodixanol and other contrast agents in the urine .
Refractometry or urine osmolality may be substituted .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : A lactating woman may pump and discard breast milk for 10 hours after iodixanol administration .
( 8 . 2 ) • Geriatrics : Exercise caution in dose selection for elderly patients .
( 8 . 5 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no data with iodixanol use in pregnant women to inform any drug - associated risks .
In animal reproduction studies , no developmental toxicity occurred with intravenous iodixanol administration to rats and rabbits at doses up to 0 . 24 ( rat ) or 0 . 48 ( rabbit ) times the maximum recommended human intravenous dose ( see Data ) .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Reproduction studies were performed in rats and rabbits with intravenous administration of iodixanol at doses up to 2 g Iodine / kg , daily , from implantation of the embryo ( gestation day 7 in rat ; 6 in rabbit ) through closure of the hard palate ( gestation day 17 in rats ; 18 in rabbits ) .
No maternal toxicity occurred , and no adverse effects occurred on fetal survival , embryo - fetal development , or the ability of dams to rear a litter .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of iodixanol in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production .
Iodinated contrast agents are poorly excreted into human milk and are poorly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract of a breastfed infant .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for iodixanol and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from iodixanol or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations Interruption of breastfeeding after exposure to iodinated contrast agents is not necessary because the potential exposure of the breastfed infant to iodine is small .
However , a lactating woman may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk for 10 hours ( approximately 5 elimination half - lives ) after iodixanol administration in order to minimize drug exposure to a breast fed infant .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of iodixanol have been established in pediatric patients down to birth for angiocardiography , cerebral arteriography , visceral arteriography , CT imaging of the head and body , and excretory urography .
The safety and efficacy of iodixanol have also been established in pediatric patients 12 years and older for intra - arterial digital subtraction angiography , peripheral arteriography , peripheral venography and CCTA .
Use of iodixanol is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies of iodixanol in adults and additional safety data obtained in 459 pediatric patients .
In general , the types of adverse reactions reported are similar to those of adults .
A higher number of adverse events in patients less than 1 year of age compared to older patients were observed in a study of iodixanol [ see Adverse Events ( 6 . 3 ) ] .
The elimination of iodixanol is slower in this age group [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Thyroid function tests indicative of thyroid dysfunction , characterized by hypothyroidism or transient thyroid suppression have been reported following iodinated contrast media administration in pediatric patients , including term and preterm neonates .
Some patients were treated for hypothyroidism .
Monitor pediatric patients 0 to 3 years of age closely , particularly those with one or more potential risk factors , for thyroid dysfunction [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Pediatric patients at higher risk of experiencing an adverse reaction during and after administration of any contrast agent may include those with asthma , hypersensitivity to other medication and / or allergens , cyanotic and acyanotic heart disease , congestive heart failure , or a serum creatinine greater than 1 . 5 mg / dL .
Pediatric patients with immature renal function or dehydration may be at increased risk for adverse events due to slower elimination of iodinated contrast agents [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In clinical studies of iodixanol , 254 / 757 ( 34 % ) of patients were 65 and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
10 OVERDOSAGE The adverse effects of overdosage of any contrast agent may be life - threatening and affect mainly the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems .
Treatment of an overdosage is directed toward the support of all vital functions and prompt institution of symptomatic therapy .
Iodixanol injection does not bind to plasma or serum protein and can be dialyzed .
11 DESCRIPTION 11 . 1 Chemical Characteristics Iodixanol injection , USP is a dimeric , iso - osmolar , nonionic , water - soluble , radiographic contrast medium for intravascular ( intravenous and intra - arterial ) use .
It is provided as a ready - to - use sterile , pyrogen - free , and preservative free , colorless to pale yellow solution .
The chemical formula is 5 , 5 ´ - [ ( 2 - hydroxy - 1 , 3 - propanediyl ) bis ( acetylimino ) ] bis [ N , N ´ - bis ( 2 , 3 - dihydroxypropyl ) - 2 , 4 , 6 - triiodo - 1 , 3 - benzenedicarboxamide ] with a molecular weight of 1 , 550 . 18 ( iodine content 49 . 1 % ) .
Iodixanol ( C 35 H 44 I 6 N 6 O 15 ) has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Iodixanol injection , USP is available in two strengths : • Iodixanol Injection , USP , 270 mg Iodine / mL ( 550 mg Iodixanol / mL ) , 0 . 074 mg calcium chloride dihydrate , 1 . 87 mg sodium chloride , 1 . 2 mg tromethamine , and 0 . 1 mg edetate calcium disodium .
• Iodixanol Injection , USP , 320 mg Iodine / mL ( 652 mg Iodixanol / mL ) , 0 . 044 mg calcium chloride dihydrate , 1 . 11 mg sodium chloride , 1 . 2 mg tromethamine and 0 . 1 mg edetate calcium disodium .
Sodium chloride and calcium chloride have been added , resulting in an isotonic solution for injection providing for both concentrations a sodium / calcium ratio equivalent to blood .
The pH is adjusted to 7 . 4 with hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide to achieve a range between pH 6 . 8 and 7 . 7 at 22 ° C . [ MULTIMEDIA ] 11 . 2 Physical Characteristics The two concentrations of iodixanol injection , USP ( 270 mg Iodine / mL and 320 mg Iodine / mL ) have the following physical properties : TABLE 4 Physical Properties of Iodixanol Injection , USPParameter Concentration ( mg Iodine / mL ) 320 270 Osmolality ( mOsmol / kg water ) 290 290 Viscosity ( cP ) @ 20 ° C 26 . 6 12 . 7 @ 37 ° C 11 . 8 6 . 3 Density ( g / mL ) @ 20 ° C 1 . 369 1 . 314 @ 37 ° C 1 . 356 1 . 303 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Intravascular injection of iodixanol opacifies vessels in the path of flow of the contrast agent , permitting visualization of internal structures .
In imaging of the body , iodinated contrast agents diffuse from the vascular into the extravascular space .
In a normal brain with an intact blood - brain barrier , contrast does not diffuse into the extravascular space .
In patients with a disrupted blood - brain barrier , contrast agent accumulates in the interstitial space in the region of disruption .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Following administration of iodixanol , the degree of enhancement is directly related to the iodine content in an administered dose .
Peak iodine plasma levels occur immediately following rapid injection .
The time to maximum contrast enhancement can vary , depending on the organ , from the time that peak blood iodine concentrations are reached to one hour after intravenous bolus administration .
When a delay between peak blood iodine concentrations and peak contrast is present , it suggests that radiographic contrast enhancement is at least in part dependent on the accumulation of iodine - containing medium within the lesion and outside the blood pool .
For angiography , contrast enhancement is greatest immediately ( 15 seconds to 120 seconds ) after rapid injection .
Iodinated contrast agents may be visualized in the renal parenchyma within 30 to 60 seconds following rapid intravenous injection .
Opacification of the calyces and pelves in patients with normal renal function becomes apparent within 1 to 3 minutes , with optimum contrast occurring within 5 to 15 minutes .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution In an in vitro human plasma study , iodixanol did not bind to protein .
The volume of distribution in adults was 0 . 26 L / kg body weight , consistent with distribution to extracellular space .
Elimination In 40 healthy , young male volunteers receiving a single intravenous administration of iodixanol in doses of 0 . 3 gram Iodine / kg to 1 . 2 gram Iodine / kg body weight , the elimination half - life was 2 . 1 hr .
( ± 0 . 1 ) .
Renal clearance was 110 ± 14 mL / min , equivalent to glomerular filtration ( 108 mL / min ) .
These values were independent of the dose administered .
Metabolism Iodixanol does not undergo metabolism .
Excretion In adults , approximately 97 % of the injected dose of iodixanol is excreted unchanged in urine within 24 hours , with less than 2 % excreted in feces within five days post - injection .
Specific Populations Pediatric : Forty pediatric patients ≤ 12 years old , with renal function that is normal for their age , received multiple intra - arterial administrations of iodixanol in doses of 0 . 32 gram Iodine / kg to 3 . 2 gram Iodine / kg body weight .
The elimination half - lives for these patients are shown in Table 5 .
Dose adjustments to account for differences in elimination half - life in pediatric patients less than 6 months of age have not been studied .

In a study of 16 adult patients who were scheduled for renal transplant , the mean creatinine clearance was 13 . 6 ± 4 . 7 mL / min ) .
In these patients , plasma half - life was 23 hours ( t 1 / 2 for typical patients = 2 . 1 hours ) .
Contrast enhancement time in kidneys increased from 6 hours to at least 24 hours .
Dose adjustments in patients with renal impairment have not been studied .
In patients with normal blood brain barriers and severe renal impairment , iodinated contrast agents have been associated with blood - brain barrier disruption and accumulation of contrast in the brain .
Iodixanol has been shown to be dialyzable .
In an in vitro hemodialysis study , after 4 hours of dialysis with a cellulose membrane , approximately 36 % of iodixanol was removed from the plasma .
After 4 hours of dialysis with polysulfone membranes , approximately 49 % of iodixanol was removed .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term animal studies have not been performed with iodixanol to evaluate carcinogenic potential .
Iodixanol was not genotoxic in a series of studies including the Ames test , the CHO / HGPRT assay , a chromosome aberration assay in CHO cells , and a mouse micronucleus assay .
Iodixanol did not impair the fertility of male or female rats when administered at doses up to 0 . 24 times the maximum recommended human dose .
