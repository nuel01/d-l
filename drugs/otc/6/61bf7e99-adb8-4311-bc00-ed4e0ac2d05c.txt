[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Lisinopril - Hydrochlorothiazide As a result of its diuretic effects , hydrochlorothiazide increases plasma renin activity , increases aldosterone secretion , and decreases serum potassium .
Administration of lisinopril blocks the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone axis and tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with the diuretic .
In clinical studies , the extent of blood pressure reduction seen with the combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide was approximately additive .
The Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets 10 / 12 . 5 combination worked equally well in Black and Caucasian patients .
The Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets 20 / 12 . 5 and Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets 20 / 25 ( a previously - marketed strength ) combinations appeared somewhat less effective in Black patients , but relatively few Black patients were studied .
In most patients , the antihypertensive effect of Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets was sustained for at least 24 hours .
In a randomized , controlled comparison , the mean antihypertensive effects of Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets 20 / 12 . 5 and Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets 20 / 25 were similar , suggesting that many patients who respond adequately to the latter combination may be controlled with Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets 20 / 12 . 5 ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Concomitant administration of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide has little or no effect on the bioavailability of either drug .
The combination tablet is bioequivalent to concomitant administration of the separate entities .
Lisinopril Mechanism of Action Lisinopril inhibits angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) in human subjects and animals .
ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance , angiotensin II .
Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex .
Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion .
The latter decrease may result in a small increase of serum potassium .
Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity .
In hypertensive patients with normal renal function treated with lisinopril alone for up to 24 weeks , the mean increase in serum potassium was less than 0 . 1 mEq / L ; however , approximately 15 percent of patients had increases greater than 0 . 5 mEq / L and approximately six percent had a decrease greater than0 . 5 mEq / L .
In the same study , patients treated with lisinopril plus a thiazide diuretic showed essentially no change in serum potassium ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
ACE is identical to kininase , an enzyme that degrades bradykinin .
Whether increased levels of bradykinin , a potent vasodepressor peptide , play a role in the therapeutic effects of lisinopril remains to be elucidated .
While the mechanism through which lisinopril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system , lisinopril is antihypertensive even in patients with low - renin hypertension .
Although lisinopril was antihypertensive in all races studied , Black hypertensive patients ( usually a low - renin hypertensive population ) had a smaller average response to lisinopril monotherapy than non - Black patients .
Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Following oral administration of lisinopril , peak serum concentrations occur within about 7 hours .
Declining serum concentrations exhibit a prolonged terminal phase which does not contribute to drug accumulation .
This terminal phase probably represents saturable binding to ACE and is not proportional to dose .
Lisinopril does not appear to be bound to other serum proteins .
Lisinopril does not undergo metabolism and is excreted unchanged entirely in the urine .
Based on urinary recovery , the mean extent of absorption of lisinopril is approximately 25 percent , with large intersubject variability ( 6 to 60 percent ) at all doses tested ( 5 to 80 mg ) .
Lisinopril absorption is not influenced by the presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract .
Upon multiple dosing , lisinopril exhibits an effective half - life of accumulation of 12 hours .
Impaired renal function decreases elimination of lisinopril , which is excreted principally through the kidneys , but this decrease becomes clinically important only when the glomerular filtration rate is below 30 mL / min .
Above this glomerular filtration rate , the elimination half - life is little changed .
With greater impairment , however , peak and trough lisinopril levels increase , time to peak concentration increases and time to attain steady state is prolonged .
Older patients , on average , have ( approximately doubled ) higher blood levels and area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AUC ) than younger patients ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis .
Studies in rats indicate that lisinopril crosses the blood - brain barrier poorly .
Multiple doses of lisinopril in rats do not result in accumulation in any tissues .
However , milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of 14 C lisinopril .
By whole body autoradiography , radioactivity was found in the placenta following administration of labeled drug to pregnant rats , but none was found in the fetuses .
Pharmacodynamics Administration of lisinopril to patients with hypertension results in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressure to about the same extent with no compensatory tachycardia .
Symptomatic postural hypotension is usually not observed although it can occur and should be anticipated in volume and / or salt - depleted patients ( see WARNINGS ) .
In most patients studied , onset of antihypertensive activity was seen at one hour after oral administration of an individual dose of lisinopril , with peak reduction of blood pressure achieved by six hours .
In some patients achievement of optimal blood pressure reduction may require two to four weeks of therapy .
At recommended single daily doses , antihypertensive effects have been maintained for at least 24 hours after dosing , although the effect at 24 hours was substantially smaller than the effect six hours after dosing .
The antihypertensive effects of lisinopril have continued during long - term therapy .
Abrupt withdrawal of lisinopril has not been associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure ; nor with a significant overshoot of pretreatment blood pressure .
In hemodynamic studies in patients with essential hypertension , blood pressure reduction was accompanied by a reduction in peripheral arterial resistance with little or no change in cardiac output and in heart rate .
In a study in nine hypertensive patients , following administration of lisinopril , there was an increase in mean renal blood flow that was not significant .
Data from several small studies are inconsistent with respect to the effect of lisinopril on glomerular filtration rate in hypertensive patients with normal renal function , but suggest that changes , if any , are not large .
In patients with renovascular hypertension lisinopril has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in controlling blood pressure ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
Hydrochlorothiazide The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown .
Thiazides do not usually affect normal blood pressure .
Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and antihypertensive .
It affects the distal renal tubular mechanism of electrolyte reabsorption .
Hydrochlorothiazide increases excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts .
Natriuresis may be accompanied by some loss of potassium and bicarbonate .
After oral use diuresis begins within two hours , peaks in about four hours and lasts about 6 to 12 hours .
Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized but is eliminated rapidly by the kidney .
When plasma levels have been followed for at least 24 hours , the plasma half - life has been observed to vary between 5 . 6 and 14 . 8 hours .
At least 61 percent of the oral dose is eliminated unchanged within 24 hours .
Hydrochlorothiazide crosses the placental but not the blood - brain barrier .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets is indicated for the treatment of hypertension , to lower blood pressure .
Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non - fatal cardiovascular events , primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions .
These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide .
Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management , including , as appropriate , lipid control , diabetes management , antithrombotic therapy , smoking cessation , exercise , and limited sodium intake .
Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals .
For specific advice on goals and management , see published guidelines , such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program ’ s Joint National Committee on Prevention , Detection , Evaluation , and Treatment of High Blood Pressure ( JNC ) .
Numerous antihypertensive drugs , from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action , have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality , and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction , and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs , that is largely responsible for those benefits .
The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke , but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly .
Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk , and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures , so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit .
Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk , so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension ( for example , patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia ) , and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal .
Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects ( as monotherapy ) in black patients , and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects ( e . g . , on angina , heart failure , or diabetic kidney disease ) .
These considerations may guide selection of therapy .
These fixed - dose combinations are not indicated for initial therapy ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
In using Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets , consideration should be given to the fact that an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor , captopril , has caused agranulocytosis , particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease , and that available data are insufficient to show that lisinopril does not have a similar risk ( see WARNINGS ) .
In considering use of Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets , it should be noted that Black patients receiving ACE inhibitors have been reported to have a higher incidence of angioedema compared to non - Blacks ( see WARNINGS , Head and Neck Angioedema ) .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to any component of this product and in patients with a history of angioedema related to previous treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and in patients with hereditary or idiopathic angioedema .
Because of the hydrochlorothiazide component , this product is contraindicated in patients with anuria or hypersensitivity to other sulfonamide - derived drugs .
Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets is contraindicated in combination with a neprilysin inhibitor ( e . g . , sacubitril ) .
Do not administer Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets within 36 hours of switching to or from sacubitril / valsartan , a neprilysin inhibitor ( see WARNINGS ) .
Do not coadminister aliskiren with Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets in patients with diabetes .
WARNINGS General Lisinopril Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions Presumably because angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors affect the metabolism of eicosanoids and polypeptides , including endogenous bradykinin , patients receiving ACE inhibitors ( including Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets ) may be subject to a variety of adverse reactions , some of them serious .
Head and Neck Angioedema : Angioedema of the face , extremities , lips , tongue , glottis and / or larynx has been reported rarely in patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors , including lisinopril .
This may occur at any time during treatment .
ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of angioedema in Black than in non - Black patients .
In such cases Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and monitoring should be provided until complete and sustained resolution of signs and symptoms has occurred .
Even in those instances where swelling of only the tongue is involved , without respiratory distress , patients may require prolonged observation since treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids may not be sufficient .
Very rarely , fatalities have been reported due to angioedema associated with laryngeal edema or tongue edema .
Patients with involvement of the tongue , glottis or larynx are likely to experience airway obstruction , especially those with a history of airway surgery .
Where there is involvement of the tongue , glottis or larynx , likely to cause airway obstruction , subcutaneous epinephrine solution 1 : 1000 ( 0 . 3 mL to 0 . 5 mL ) and / or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway , should be promptly provided ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
Patients with a history of angioedema unrelated to ACE - inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE inhibitor ( see also INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) inhibitor ( e . g . , temsirolimus , sirolimus , everolimus ) therapy or a neprilysin inhibitor may be at increased risk for angioedema ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
Intestinal Angioedema : Intestinal angioedema has been reported in patients treated with ACE inhibitors .
These patients presented with abdominal pain ( with or without nausea or vomiting ) ; in some cases there was no prior history of facial angioedema and C - 1 esterase levels were normal .
The angioedema was diagnosed by procedures including abdominal CT scan or ultrasound , or at surgery , and symptoms resolved after stopping the ACE inhibitor .
Intestinal angioedema should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients on ACE inhibitors presenting with abdominal pain .
Anaphylactoid reactions during desensitization : Two patients undergoing desensitizing treatment with hymenoptera venom while receiving ACE inhibitors sustained life - threatening anaphylactoid reactions .
In the same patients , these reactions were avoided when ACE inhibitors were temporarily withheld , but they reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge .
Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure : Sudden and potentially life - threatening anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in some patients dialyzed with high - flux membranes and treated concomitantly with an ACE inhibitor .
In such patients , dialysis must be stopped immediately , and aggressive therapy for anaphylactoid reactions must be initiated .
Symptoms have not been relieved by antihistamines in these situations .
In these patients , consideration should be given to using a different type of dialysis membrane or a different class of antihypertensive agent .
Anaphylactoid reactions have also been reported in patients undergoing low - density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate absorption .
Hypotension and Related Effects Excessive hypotension was rarely seen in uncomplicated hypertensive patients but is a possible consequence of lisinopril use in salt / volume - depleted persons , such as those treated vigorously with diuretics or patients on dialysis ( see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
Syncope has been reported in 0 . 8 percent of patients receiving Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets .
In patients with hypertension receiving lisinopril alone , the incidence of syncope was 0 . 1 percent .
The overall incidence of syncope may be reduced by proper titration of the individual components ( see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions , ADVERSE REACTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
In patients with severe congestive heart failure , with or without associated renal insufficiency , excessive hypotension has been observed and may be associated with oliguria and / or progressive azotemia , and rarely with acute renal failure and / or death .
Because of the potential fall in blood pressure in these patients , therapy should be started under very close medical supervision .
Such patients should be followed closely for the first two weeks of treatment and whenever the dose of lisinopril and / or diuretic is increased .
Similar considerations apply to patients with ischemic heart or cerebrovascular disease in whom an excessive fall in blood pressure could result in a myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident .
If hypotension occurs , the patient should be placed in supine position and , if necessary , receive an intravenous infusion of normal saline .
A transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further doses which usually can be given without difficulty once the blood pressure has increased after volume expansion .
Neutropenia / Agranulocytosis Another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor , captopril , has been shown to cause agranulocytosis and bone marrow depression , rarely in uncomplicated patients but more frequently in patients with renal impairment , especially if they also have a collagen vascular disease .
Available data from clinical trials of lisinopril are insufficient to show that lisinopril does not cause agranulocytosis at similar rates .
Marketing experience has revealed rare cases of neutropenia and bone marrow depression in which a causal relationship to lisinopril cannot be excluded .
Periodic monitoring of white blood cell counts in patients with collagen vascular disease and renal disease should be considered .
Hepatic Failure Rarely , ACE inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic jaundice or hepatitis and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis , and ( sometimes ) death .
The mechanism of this syndrome is not understood .
Patients receiving ACE inhibitors who develop jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes should discontinue the ACE inhibitor and receive appropriate medical follow - up .
Hydrochlorothiazide Thiazides should be used with caution in severe renal disease .
In patients with renal disease , thiazides may precipitate azotemia .
Cumulative effects of the drug may develop in patients with impaired renal function .
Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease , since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma .
Sensitivity reactions may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma .
The possibility of exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported .
Lithium generally should not be given with thiazides ( see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions , Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide ) .
Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle - Closure Glaucoma : Hydrochlorothiazide , a sulfonamide , can cause an idiosyncratic reaction , resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle - closure glaucoma .
Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation .
Untreated acute angle - closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss .
The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible .
Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled .
Risk factors for developing acute angle - closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy .
Fetal Toxicity Pregnancy Category D Use of drugs that act on the renin - angiotensin system during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy reduces fetal renal function and increases fetal and neonatal morbidity and death .
Resulting oligohydramnios can be associated with fetal lung hypoplasia and skeletal deformations .
Potential neonatal adverse effects include skull hypoplasia , anuria , hypotension , renal failure , and death .
When pregnancy is detected , discontinue Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets as soon as possible .
These adverse outcomes are usually associated with the use of these drugs in the second and third trimester of pregnancy .
Most epidemiologic studies examining fetal abnormalities after exposure to antihypertensive use in the first trimester have not distinguished drugs affecting the renin - angiotensin system from other antihypertensive agents .
Appropriate management of maternal hypertension during pregnancy is important to optimize outcomes for both mother and fetus .
In the unusual case that there is no appropriate alternative therapy to drugs affecting the renin - angiotensin system for a particular patient , apprise the mother of the potential risk to the fetus .
Perform serial ultrasound examinations to assess the intra - amniotic environment .
If oligohydramnios is observed , discontinue Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets , unless it is considered lifesaving for the mother .
Fetal testing may be appropriate , based on the week of pregnancy .
Patients and physicians should be aware , however , that oligohydramnios may not appear until after the fetus has sustained irreversible injury .
Closely observe infants with histories of in utero exposure to Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets for hypotension , oliguria , and hyperkalemia ( see PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use ) .
Lisinopril - Hydrochlorothiazide Teratogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats with up to 90 mg / kg / day of lisinopril in combination with 10 mg / kg / day of hydrochlorothiazide .
This dose of lisinopril is 5 times ( in mice ) and 10 times ( in rats ) the maximum recommended human daily dose ( MRHDD ) when compared on a body surface area basis ( mg / m2 ) ; the dose of hydrochlorothiazide is 0 . 9 times ( in mice ) and 1 . 8 times ( in rats ) the MRHDD .
Maternal or fetotoxic effects were not seen in mice with the combination .
In rats decreased maternal weight gain and decreased fetal weight occurred down to 3 / 10 mg / kg / day ( the lowest dose tested ) .
Associated with the decreased fetal weight was a delay in fetal ossification .
The decreased fetal weight and delay in fetal ossification were not seen in saline - supplemented animals given 90 / 10 mg / kg / day .
No teratogenic effects of lisinopril were seen in studies of pregnant mice , rats , and rabbits .
On a body surface area basis , the doses used were up 55 times , 33 times , and 0 . 15 times , respectively , the MRHDD .
Hydrochlorothiazide Studies in which hydrochlorothiazide was orally administered to pregnant mice and rats during their respective periods of major organogenesis at doses up to 3000 and 1000 mg / kg / day , respectively , provided no evidence of harm to the fetus .
These doses are more than 150 times the MRHDD on a body surface area basis .
Thiazides cross the placental barrier and appear in cord blood .
There is a risk of fetal or neonatal jaundice , thrombocytopenia and possibly other adverse reactions that have occurred in adults .
PRECAUTIONS General Lisinopril Aortic Stenosis / Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy : As with all vasodilators , lisinopril should be given with caution to patients with obstruction in the outflow tract of the left ventricle .
Impaired Renal Function : As a consequence of inhibiting the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system , changes in renal function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals .
In patients with severe congestive heart failure whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system , treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors , including lisinopril , may be associated with oliguria and / or progressive azotemia and rarely with acute renal failure and / or death .
In hypertensive patients with unilateral or bilateral renal artery stenosis , increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine may occur .
Experience with another angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor suggests that these increases are usually reversible upon discontinuation of lisinopril and / or diuretic therapy .
In such patients renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of therapy .
Some hypertensive patients with no apparent pre - existing renal vascular disease have developed increases in blood urea and serum creatinine , usually minor and transient , especially when lisinopril has been given concomitantly with a diuretic .
This is more likely to occur in patients with pre - existing renal impairment .
Dosage reduction of lisinopril and / or discontinuation of the diuretic may be required .
Evaluation of the hypertensive patient should always include assessment of renal function ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Hyperkalemia : In clinical trials hyperkalemia ( serum potassium greater than 5 . 7 mEq / L ) occurred in approximately 1 . 4 percent of hypertensive patients treated with lisinopril plus hydrochlorothiazide .
In most cases these were isolated values which resolved despite continued therapy .
Hyperkalemia was not a cause of discontinuation of therapy .
Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency , diabetes mellitus , and the concomitant use of potassium - sparing diuretics , potassium supplements and / or potassium - containing salt substitutes .
Hyperkalemia can cause serious , sometimes fatal , arrhythmias .
Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets should be used cautiously , if at all , with these agents and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium ( see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ) .
Cough : Presumably due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin , persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors , always resolving after discontinuation of therapy .
ACE inhibitor - induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough .
Surgery / Anesthesia : In patients undergoing major surgery or during anesthesia with agents that produce hypotension , lisinopril may block angiotensin II formation secondary to compensatory renin release .
If hypotension occurs and is considered to be due to this mechanism , it can be corrected by volume expansion .
Hydrochlorothiazide Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be performed at appropriate intervals .
All patients receiving thiazide therapy should be observed for clinical signs of fluid or electrolyte imbalance : namely , hyponatremia , hypochloremic alkalosis , and hypokalemia .
Serum and urine electrolyte determinations are particularly important when the patient is vomiting excessively or receiving parenteral fluids .
Warning signs or symptoms of fluid and electrolyte imbalance , irrespective of cause , include dryness of mouth , thirst , weakness , lethargy , drowsiness , restlessness , confusion , seizures , muscle pains or cramps , muscular fatigue , hypotension , oliguria , tachycardia , and gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and vomiting .
Hypokalemia may develop , especially with brisk diuresis , when severe cirrhosis is present , or after prolonged therapy .
Interference with adequate oral electrolyte intake will also contribute to hypokalemia .
Hypokalemia may cause cardiac arrhythmia and may also sensitize or exaggerate the response of the heart to the toxic effects of digitalis ( e . g . , increased ventricular irritability ) .
Because lisinopril reduces the production of aldosterone , concomitant therapy with lisinopril attenuates the diuretic - induced potassium loss ( see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions , Agents Increasing Serum Potassium ) .
Although any chloride deficit is generally mild and usually does not require specific treatment , except under extraordinary circumstances ( as in liver disease or renal disease ) , chloride replacement may be required in the treatment of metabolic alkalosis .
Dilutional hyponatremia may occur in edematous patients in hot weather ; appropriate therapy is water restriction , rather than administration of salt except in rare instances when the hyponatremia is life - threatening .
In actual salt depletion , appropriate replacement is the therapy of choice .
Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy .
In diabetic patients dosage adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents may be required .
Hyperglycemia may occur with thiazide diuretics .
Thus latent diabetes mellitus may become manifest during thiazide therapy .
The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post sympathectomy patient .
If progressive renal impairment becomes evident consider withholding or discontinuing diuretic therapy .
Thiazides have been shown to increase the urinary excretion of magnesium ; this may result in hypomagnesemia .
Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion .
Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism .
Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism .
Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function .
Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with thiazide diuretic therapy .
Information for Patients Angioedema : Angioedema , including laryngeal edema , may occur at any time during treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors , including lisinopril .
Patients should be so advised and told to report immediately any signs or symptoms suggesting angioedema ( swelling of face , extremities , eyes , lips , tongue , difficulty in swallowing or breathing ) and to take no more drug until they have consulted with the prescribing physician .
Symptomatic Hypotension : Patients should be cautioned to report lightheadedness especially during the first few days of therapy .
If actual syncope occurs , the patients should be told to discontinue the drug until they have consulted with the prescribing physician .
All patients should be cautioned that excessive perspiration and dehydration may lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure because of reduction in fluid volume .
Other causes of volume depletion such as vomiting or diarrhea may also lead to a fall in blood pressure ; patients should be advised to consult with their physician .
Hyperkalemia : Patients should be told not to use salt substitutes containing potassium without consulting their physician .
Neutropenia : Patients should be told to report promptly any indication of infection ( e . g . , sore throat , fever ) which may be a sign of neutropenia .
Pregnancy : Female patients of childbearing age should be told about the consequences of exposure to Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets during pregnancy .
Discuss treatment options with women planning to become pregnant .
Patients should be asked to report pregnancies to their physicians as soon as possible .
Non - melanoma Skin Cancer : Instruct patients taking hydrochlorothiazide to protect skin from the sun and undergo regular skin cancer screening .
Drug Interactions Lisinopril Hypotension — Patients on Diuretic Therapy : Patients on diuretics , and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted , may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with lisinopril .
The possibility of hypotensive effects with lisinopril can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with lisinopril .
If it is necessary to continue the diuretic , initiate therapy with lisinopril at a dose of 5 mg daily , and provide close medical supervision after the initial dose for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour ( see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
When a diuretic is added to the therapy of a patient receiving lisinopril , an additional antihypertensive effect is usually observed ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Non - steroidal Anti - inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) Inhibitors : In patients who are elderly , volume - depleted ( including those on diuretic therapy ) , or with compromised renal function , co - administration of NSAIDs , including selective COX - 2 inhibitors , with ACE inhibitors , including lisinopril , may result in deterioration of renal function , including possible acute renal failure .
These effects are usually reversible .
Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving lisinopril and NSAID therapy .
The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors , including lisinopril , may be attenuated by NSAIDs .
Dual Blockade of the Renin - Angiotensin System ( RAS ) : Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers , ACE inhibitors , or direct renin inhibitors ( such as aliskiren ) is associated with increased risk of hypotension , syncope , hyperkalemia , and changes in renal function ( including acute renal failure ) compared to monotherapy .
The VA NEPHRON trial enrolled 1448 patients with type 2 diabetes , elevated urinary - albumin to - creatinine ratio , and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR 30 to 89 . 9 ml / min ) , randomized them to lisinopril or placebo on a background of losartan therapy and followed them for a median of 2 . 2 years .
Patients receiving the combination of losartan and lisinopril did not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy for the combined endpoint of decline in GFR , end state renal disease , or death , but experienced an increased incidence of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury compared with the monotherapy group .
In general , avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors .
Monitor blood pressure , renal function , and electrolytes in patients on Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets and other agents that affect the RAS .
Do not coadminister aliskiren with Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets in patients with diabetes .
Avoid use of aliskiren with PRINZIDE in patients with renal impairment ( GFR < 60 ml / min ) .
Other Agents : Lisinopril has been used concomitantly with nitrates and / or digoxin without evidence of clinically significant adverse interactions .
No meaningful clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when lisinopril was used concomitantly with propranolol , digoxin , or hydrochlorothiazide .
The presence of food in the stomach does not alter the bioavailability of lisinopril .
Agents Increasing Serum Potassium : Lisinopril attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazide - type diuretics .
Use of lisinopril with potassium - sparing diuretics ( e . g . , spironolactone , eplerenone , triamterene , or amiloride ) , potassium supplements , or potassium - containing salt substitutes may lead to significant increases in serum potassium .
Therefore , if concomitant use of these agents is indicated , because of demonstrated hypokalemia , they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium .
Lithium : Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with drugs which cause elimination of sodium , including ACE inhibitors .
Lithium toxicity was usually reversible upon discontinuation of lithium and the ACE inhibitor .
It is recommended that serum lithium levels be monitored frequently if lisinopril is administered concomitantly with lithium .
Gold : Nitritoid reactions ( symptoms include facial flushing , nausea , vomiting and hypotension ) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold ( sodium aurothiomalate ) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets .
mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) inhibitors : Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor ( e . g . , temsirolimus , sirolimus , everolimus ) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema ( seeWARNINGS ) .
Neprilysin Inhibitors : Patients taking concomitant neprilysin inhibitors may be at increased risk for angioedema ( see WARNINGS ) .
Hydrochlorothiazide When administered concurrently the following drugs may interact with thiazide diuretics .
Alcohol , barbiturates , or narcotics — potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur .
Antidiabetic drugs ( oral agents and insulin ) — dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required .
Other antihypertensive drugs — additive effect or potentiation .
Cholestyramine and colestipol resins — Absorption of hydrochlorothiazide is impaired in the presence of anionic exchange resins .
Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85 and 43 percent , respectively .
Corticosteroids , ACTH — intensified electrolyte depletion , particularly hypokalemia .
Pressor amines ( e . g . , norepinephrine ) — possible decreased response to pressor amines but not sufficient to preclude their use .
Skeletal muscle relaxants , nondepolarizing ( e . g . , tubocurarine ) — possible increased responsiveness to the muscle relaxant .
Lithium — should not generally be given with diuretics .
Diuretic agents reduce the renal clearance of lithium and add a high risk of lithium toxicity .
Refer to the package insert for lithium preparations before use of such preparations with Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets .
Non - steroidal Anti - inflammatory Drugs — In some patients , the administration of a non - steroidal anti - inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic , natriuretic , and antihypertensive effects of loop , potassium - sparing and thiazide diuretics .
Therefore , when Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets and non - steroidal anti - inflammatory agents are used concomitantly , the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets is obtained .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Lisinopril - Hydrochlorothiazide Lisinopril in combination with hydrochlorothiazide was not mutagenic in a microbial mutagen test using Salmonella typhimurium ( Ames test ) or Escherichia coli with or without metabolic activation or in a forward mutation assay using Chinese hamster lung cells .
Lisinopril - hydrochlorothiazide did not produce DNA single strand breaks in an in vitro alkaline elution rat hepatocyte assay .
In addition , it did not produce increases in chromosomal aberrations in an in vitro test in Chinese hamster ovary cells or in an in vivo study in mouse bone marrow .
Lisinopril There was no evidence of a tumorigenic effect when lisinopril was administered orally for 105 weeks to male and female rats at doses up to 90 mg / kg / day or for 92 weeks to male and female mice at doses up to 135 mg / kg / day .
These doses are 10 times and 7 times , respectively , the maximum recommended human daily dose ( MRHDD ) when compared on a body surface area basis .
Lisinopril was not mutagenic in the Ames microbial mutagen test with or without metabolic activation .
It was also negative in a forward mutation assay using Chinese hamster lung cells .
Lisinopril did not produce single strand DNA breaks in an in vitro alkaline elution rat hepatocyte assay .
In addition , lisinopril did not produce increases in chromosomal aberrations in an in vitro test in Chinese hamster ovary cells or in an in vivo study in mouse bone marrow .
There were no adverse effects on reproductive performance in male and female rats treated with up to 300 mg / kg / day of lisinopril ( 33 times the MRHDD when compared on a body surface area basis ) .
Hydrochlorothiazide Two - year feeding studies in mice and rats conducted under the auspices of the National Toxicology Program ( NTP ) uncovered no evidence of a carcinogenic potential of hydrochlorothiazide in female mice at doses of up to approximately 600 mg / kg / day ( 53 times the MRHDD when compared on a body surface area basis ) or in male and female rats at doses of up to approximately 100 mg / kg / day ( 18 times the MRHDD when compared on a body surface area basis ) .
The NTP , however , found equivocal evidence for hepatocarcinogenicity in male mice .
Hydrochlorothiazide was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames mutagenicity assay of Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98 , TA 100 , TA 1535 , TA 1537 , and TA 1538 and in the Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) test for chromosomal aberrations , or in vivo in assays using mouse germinal cell chromosomes , Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosomes , and the Drosophila sex - linked recessive lethal trait gene .
Positive test results were obtained only in the in vitro CHO Sister Chromatid Exchange ( clastogenicity ) and in the Mouse Lymphoma Cell ( mutagenicity ) assays , using concentrations of hydrochlorothiazide from 43 to 1300 mcg / mL , and in the Aspergillus nidulans non - disjunction assay at an unspecified concentration .
Hydrochlorothiazide had no adverse effects on the fertility of mice and rats of either sex in studies wherein these species were exposed , via their diet , to doses of up to 100 and 4 mg / kg , respectively , prior to conception and throughout gestation .
In mice and rats these doses are 9 times and 0 . 7 times , respectively , the MRHDD when compared on a body surface area basis .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether lisinopril is secreted in human milk .
However , milk of lactating rats contains radioactivity following administration of 14 C lisinopril .
In another study , lisinopril was present in rat milk at levels similar to plasma levels in the dams .
Thiazides do appear in human milk .
Because of the potential for serious reactions in nursing infants from ACE inhibitors and hydrochlorothiazide , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
Pediatric Use Neonates with a history of in utero exposure to Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets : If oliguria or hypotension occurs , direct attention toward support of blood pressure and renal perfusion .
Exchange transfusions or dialysis may be required as a means of reversing hypotension and / or substituting for disordered renal function .
Lisinopril , which crosses the placenta , has been removed from neonatal circulation by peritoneal dialysis with some clinical benefit , and theoretically may be removed by exchange transfusion , although there is no experience with the latter procedure .
Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
In a multiple - dose pharmacokinetic study in elderly versus young hypertensive patients using the lisinopril / hydrochlorothiazide combination , area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AUC ) increased approximately 120 % for lisinopril and approximately 80 % for hydrochlorothiazide in older patients .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection .
Evaluation of the hypertensive patient should always include assessment of renal function ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets have been evaluated for safety in 930 patients , including 100 patients treated for 50 weeks or more .

OVERDOSAGE No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets .
Treatment is symptomatic and supportive .
Therapy with Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets should be discontinued and the patient observed closely .
Suggested measures include induction of emesis and / or gastric lavage , and correction of dehydration , electrolyte imbalance and hypotension by established procedures .
Lisinopril Following a single oral dose of 20 g / kg , no lethality occurred in rats and death occurred in one of 20 mice receiving the same dose .
The most likely manifestation of overdosage would be hypotension , for which the usual treatment would be intravenous infusion of normal saline solution .
Lisinopril can be removed by hemodialysis ( see WARNINGS , Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure ) .
Hydrochlorothiazide Oral administration of a single oral dose of 10 g / kg to mice and rats was not lethal .
The most common signs and symptoms observed are those caused by electrolyte depletion ( hypokalemia , hypochloremia , hyponatremia ) and dehydration resulting from excessive diuresis .
If digitalis has also been administered , hypokalemia may accentuate cardiac arrhythmias .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Lisinopril monotherapy is an effective treatment of hypertension in once - daily doses of 10 mg to 80 mg , while hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy is effective in doses of 12 . 5 mg to 50 mg per day .
In clinical trials of lisinopril / hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy using lisinopril doses of 10 mg to 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide doses of 6 . 25 mg to 50 mg , the antihypertensive response rates generally increased with increasing dose of either component .
The side effects ( see WARNINGS ) of lisinopril are generally rare and apparently independent of dose ; those of hydrochlorothiazide are a mixture of dose - dependent phenomena ( primarily hypokalemia ) and dose - independent phenomena ( e . g . , pancreatitis ) , the former much more common than the latter .
Therapy with any combination of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide will be associated with both sets of dose - independent side effects , but addition of lisinopril in clinical trials blunted the hypokalemia normally seen with diuretics .
To minimize dose - independent side effects , it is usually appropriate to begin combination therapy only after a patient has failed to achieve the desired effect with monotherapy .
Dose Titration Guided by Clinical Effect A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets 10 / 12 . 5 or Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets 20 / 12 . 5 .
Further increases of either or both components could depend on clinical response .
The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2 to 3 weeks have elapsed .
Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide , but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen , may achieve similar or greater blood pressure control with less potassium loss if they are switched to Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets 10 / 12 . 5 .
Dosage higher than lisinopril 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg should not be used .
Replacement Therapy The combination may be substituted for the titrated individual components .
Use in Renal Impairment The usual regimens of therapy with Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets need not be adjusted as long as the patient ' s creatinine clearance is greater than 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ( serum creatinine approximately less than or equal to 3 mg / dL or 265 µmol / L ) .
In patients with more severe renal impairment , loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides , so Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide Tablets is not recommended ( see WARNINGS , Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure ) .
