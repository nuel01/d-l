[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 2 . 7 Preparation for Administration - Vial EYLEA should be inspected visually prior to administration .
If particulates , cloudiness , or discoloration are visible , the vial must not be used .
The glass vial is for single use only .
Use aseptic technique to carry out the following preparation steps : Prepare for intravitreal injection with the following medical devices for single use : • a 5 - micron sterile filter needle ( 19 - gauge × 1 ½ - inch ) • a 1 - mL sterile Luer lock syringe ( with marking to measure 0 . 05 mL ) • a sterile injection needle ( 30 - gauge × ½ - inch ) • Remove the protective plastic cap from the vial ( see Figure 6 ) .
Figure 6 : [ MULTIMEDIA ] • Clean the top of the vial with an alcohol wipe ( see Figure 7 ) .
Figure 7 : [ MULTIMEDIA ] • Remove the 19 - gauge × 1 ½ - inch , 5 - micron , filter needle and the 1 - mL syringe from their packaging .
Attach the filter needle to the syringe by twisting it onto the Luer lock syringe tip ( see Figure 8 ) .
Figure 8 : [ MULTIMEDIA ] • Push the filter needle into the center of the vial stopper until the needle is completely inserted into the vial and the tip touches the bottom or bottom edge of the vial .
• Using aseptic technique withdraw all of the EYLEA vial contents into the syringe , keeping the vial in an upright position , slightly inclined to ease complete withdrawal .
To deter the introduction of air , ensure the bevel of the filter needle is submerged into the liquid .
Continue to tilt the vial during withdrawal keeping the bevel of the filter needle submerged in the liquid ( see Figure 9 a and Figure 9 b ) .
Figure 9 a : Figure 9 b : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] • Ensure that the plunger rod is drawn sufficiently back when emptying the vial in order to completely empty the filter needle .
• Remove the filter needle from the syringe and properly dispose of the filter needle .
Note : Filter needle is not to be used for intravitreal injection .
• Remove the 30 - gauge × ½ - inch injection needle from its packaging and attach the injection needle to the syringe by firmly twisting the injection needle onto the Luer lock syringe tip ( see Figure 10 ) .
Figure 10 : [ MULTIMEDIA ] • When ready to administer EYLEA , remove the plastic needle shield from the needle .
• Holding the syringe with the needle pointing up , check the syringe for bubbles .
If there are bubbles , gently tap the syringe with your finger until the bubbles rise to the top ( see Figure 11 ) .
Figure 11 : [ MULTIMEDIA ] • To eliminate all of the bubbles and to expel excess drug , SLOWLY depress the plunger so that the plunger tip aligns with the line that marks 0 . 05 mL on the syringe ( see Figure 12 a and Figure 12 b ) .
Figure 12 a : Figure 12 b : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 2 . 8 Injection Procedure The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under controlled aseptic conditions , which include surgical hand disinfection and the use of sterile gloves , a sterile drape , and a sterile eyelid speculum ( or equivalent ) .
Adequate anesthesia and a topical broad – spectrum microbicide should be given prior to the injection .
Pre - filled syringe : Inject by pressing the plunger carefully and with constant pressure .
Do not apply additional pressure once the plunger has reached the bottom of the syringe .
A small residual volume may remain in the syringe after a full dose has been injected .
This is normal .
Do not administer any residual solution observed in the syringe .
Immediately following the intravitreal injection , patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure .
Appropriate monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head or tonometry .
If required , a sterile paracentesis needle should be available .
Following intravitreal injection , patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment ( e . g . , eye pain , redness of the eye , photophobia , blurring of vision ) without delay [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
Each sterile , pre - filled syringe or vial should only be used for the treatment of a single eye .
If the contralateral eye requires treatment , a new sterile , pre - filled syringe or vial should be used and the sterile field , syringe , gloves , drapes , eyelid speculum , filter , and injection needles should be changed before EYLEA is administered to the other eye .
After injection , any unused product must be discarded .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS EYLEA is a clear , colorless to pale yellow solution available as : • Injection : 2 mg / 0 . 05 mL in a single - dose pre - filled glass syringe • Injection : 2 mg / 0 . 05 mL in a single - dose glass vial • Injection : 2 mg / 0 . 05 mL solution in a single - dose pre - filled syringe ( 3 ) • Injection : 2 mg / 0 . 05 mL solution in a single - dose vial ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Ocular or periocular infection ( 4 . 1 ) • Active intraocular inflammation ( 4 . 2 ) • Hypersensitivity ( 4 . 3 ) 4 . 1 Ocular or Periocular Infections EYLEA is contraindicated in patients with ocular or periocular infections .
4 . 2 Active Intraocular Inflammation EYLEA is contraindicated in patients with active intraocular inflammation .
4 . 3 Hypersensitivity EYLEA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to aflibercept or any of the excipients in EYLEA .
Hypersensitivity reactions may manifest as rash , pruritus , urticaria , severe anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions , or severe intraocular inflammation .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Endophthalmitis and retinal detachments may occur following intravitreal injections .
Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately .
( 5 . 1 ) • Increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of an intravitreal injection .
( 5 . 2 ) • There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Endophthalmitis and Retinal Detachments Intravitreal injections , including those with EYLEA , have been associated with endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Proper aseptic injection technique must always be used when administering EYLEA .
Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis or retinal detachment without delay and should be managed appropriately [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 8 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 2 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Acute increases in intraocular pressure have been seen within 60 minutes of intravitreal injection , including with EYLEA [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Sustained increases in intraocular pressure have also been reported after repeated intravitreal dosing with vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) inhibitors .
Intraocular pressure and the perfusion of the optic nerve head should be monitored and managed appropriately [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 8 ) ] .
5 . 3 Thromboembolic Events There is a potential risk of arterial thromboembolic events ( ATEs ) following intravitreal use of VEGF inhibitors , including EYLEA .
ATEs are defined as nonfatal stroke , nonfatal myocardial infarction , or vascular death ( including deaths of unknown cause ) .
The incidence of reported thromboembolic events in wet AMD studies during the first year was 1 . 8 % ( 32 out of 1824 ) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 1 . 5 % ( 9 out of 595 ) in patients treated with ranibizumab ; through 96 weeks , the incidence was 3 . 3 % ( 60 out of 1824 ) in the EYLEA group compared with 3 . 2 % ( 19 out of 595 ) in the ranibizumab group .
The incidence in the DME studies from baseline to week 52 was 3 . 3 % ( 19 out of 578 ) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 2 . 8 % ( 8 out of 287 ) in the control group ; from baseline to week 100 , the incidence was 6 . 4 % ( 37 out of 578 ) in the combined group of patients treated with EYLEA compared with 4 . 2 % ( 12 out of 287 ) in the control group .
There were no reported thromboembolic events in the patients treated with EYLEA in the first six months of the RVO studies .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following potentially serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • Hypersensitivity [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 3 ) ] • Endophthalmitis and retinal detachments [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Increase in intraocular pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Thromboembolic events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 5 % ) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage , eye pain , cataract , vitreous detachment , vitreous floaters , and intraocular pressure increased .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in other clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
A total of 2980 patients treated with EYLEA constituted the safety population in eight phase 3 studies .
Among those , 2379 patients were treated with the recommended dose of 2 mg .
Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have occurred in < 0 . 1 % of intravitreal injections with EYLEA including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment .
The most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 5 % ) reported in patients receiving EYLEA were conjunctival hemorrhage , eye pain , cataract , vitreous detachment , vitreous floaters , and intraocular pressure increased .
Neovascular ( Wet ) Age - Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) The data described below reflect exposure to EYLEA in 1824 patients with wet AMD , including 1223 patients treated with the 2 - mg dose , in 2 double - masked , controlled clinical studies ( VIEW1 and VIEW2 ) for 24 months ( with active control in year 1 ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
Safety data observed in the EYLEA group in a 52 - week , double - masked , Phase 2 study were consistent with these results .

Safety data observed in 269 patients with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy ( NPDR ) through week 52 in the PANORAMA trial were consistent with those seen in the phase 3 VIVID and VISTA trials ( see Table 3 above ) .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is a potential for an immune response in patients treated with EYLEA .
The immunogenicity of EYLEA was evaluated in serum samples .
The immunogenicity data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were considered positive for antibodies to EYLEA in immunoassays .
The detection of an immune response is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assays used , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies to EYLEA with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading .
In the wet AMD , RVO , and DME studies , the pre - treatment incidence of immunoreactivity to EYLEA was approximately 1 % to 3 % across treatment groups .
After dosing with EYLEA for 24 - 100 weeks , antibodies to EYLEA were detected in a similar percentage range of patients .
There were no differences in efficacy or safety between patients with or without immunoreactivity .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Adequate and well - controlled studies with EYLEA have not been conducted in pregnant women .
Aflibercept produced adverse embryofetal effects in rabbits , including external , visceral , and skeletal malformations .
A fetal No Observed Adverse Effect Level ( NOAEL ) was not identified .
At the lowest dose shown to produce adverse embryofetal effects , systemic exposures ( based on AUC for free aflibercept ) were approximately 6 times higher than AUC values observed in humans after a single intravitreal treatment at the recommended clinical dose [ see Animal Data ] .
Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , and it is not known whether EYLEA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Based on the anti - VEGF mechanism of action for aflibercept [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] , treatment with EYLEA may pose a risk to human embryofetal development .
EYLEA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In two embryofetal development studies , aflibercept produced adverse embryofetal effects when administered every three days during organogenesis to pregnant rabbits at intravenous doses ≥ 3 mg per kg , or every six days during organogenesis at subcutaneous doses ≥ 0 . 1 mg per kg .
Adverse embryofetal effects included increased incidences of postimplantation loss and fetal malformations , including anasarca , umbilical hernia , diaphragmatic hernia , gastroschisis , cleft palate , ectrodactyly , intestinal atresia , spina bifida , encephalomeningocele , heart and major vessel defects , and skeletal malformations ( fused vertebrae , sternebrae , and ribs ; supernumerary vertebral arches and ribs ; and incomplete ossification ) .
The maternal No Observed Adverse Effect Level ( NOAEL ) in these studies was 3 mg per kg .
Aflibercept produced fetal malformations at all doses assessed in rabbits and the fetal NOAEL was not identified .
At the lowest dose shown to produce adverse embryofetal effects in rabbits ( 0 . 1 mg per kg ) , systemic exposure ( AUC ) of free aflibercept was approximately 6 times higher than systemic exposure ( AUC ) observed in humans after a single intravitreal dose of 2 mg .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of aflibercept in human milk , the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant , or the effects of the drug on milk production / excretion .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , and because the potential for absorption and harm to infant growth and development exists , EYLEA is not recommended during breastfeeding .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for EYLEA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from EYLEA .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females of reproductive potential are advised to use effective contraception prior to the initial dose , during treatment , and for at least 3 months after the last intravitreal injection of EYLEA .
Infertility There are no data regarding the effects of EYLEA on human fertility .
Aflibercept adversely affected female and male reproductive systems in cynomolgus monkeys when administered by intravenous injection at a dose approximately 1500 times higher than the systemic level observed humans with an intravitreal dose of 2 mg .
A No Observed Adverse Effect Level ( NOAEL ) was not identified .
These findings were reversible within 20 weeks after cessation of treatment [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of EYLEA in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In the clinical studies , approximately 76 % ( 2049 / 2701 ) of patients randomized to treatment with EYLEA were ≥ 65 years of age and approximately 46 % ( 1250 / 2701 ) were ≥ 75 years of age .
No significant differences in efficacy or safety were seen with increasing age in these studies .
11 DESCRIPTION Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of portions of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2 extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 formulated as an iso - osmotic solution for intravitreal administration .
Aflibercept is a dimeric glycoprotein with a protein molecular weight of 97 kilodaltons ( kDa ) and contains glycosylation , constituting an additional 15 % of the total molecular mass , resulting in a total molecular weight of 115 kDa .
Aflibercept is produced in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells .
EYLEA ( aflibercept ) Injection is a sterile , clear , and colorless to pale yellow solution .
EYLEA is supplied as a preservative - free , sterile , aqueous solution for intravitreal injection in a single - dose pre - filled glass syringe or a single - dose glass vial designed to deliver 0 . 05 mL ( 50 microliters ) of solution containing 2 mg of aflibercept in 10 mM sodium phosphate , 40 mM sodium chloride , 0 . 03 % polysorbate 20 , and 5 % sucrose , with a pH of 6 . 2 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Vascular endothelial growth factor - A ( VEGF - A ) and placental growth factor ( PlGF ) are members of the VEGF family of angiogenic factors that can act as mitogenic , chemotactic , and vascular permeability factors for endothelial cells .
VEGF acts via two receptor tyrosine kinases , VEGFR - 1 and VEGFR - 2 , present on the surface of endothelial cells .
PlGF binds only to VEGFR - 1 , which is also present on the surface of leucocytes .
Activation of these receptors by VEGF - A can result in neovascularization and vascular permeability .
Aflibercept acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF - A and PlGF , and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF receptors .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Neovascular ( Wet ) Age - Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) In the clinical studies anatomic measures of disease activity improved similarly in all treatment groups from baseline to week 52 .
Anatomic data were not used to influence treatment decisions during the first year .
Macular Edema Following Retinal Vein Occlusion ( RVO ) Reductions in mean retinal thickness were observed in COPERNICUS , GALILEO , and VIBRANT at week 24 compared to baseline .
Anatomic data were not used to influence treatment decisions [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) , ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Diabetic Macular Edema ( DME ) Reductions in mean retinal thickness were observed in VIVID and VISTA at weeks 52 and 100 compared to baseline .
Anatomic data were not used to influence EYLEA treatment decisions [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics EYLEA is administered intravitreally to exert local effects in the eye .
In patients with wet AMD , RVO , or DME , following intravitreal administration of EYLEA , a fraction of the administered dose is expected to bind with endogenous VEGF in the eye to form an inactive aflibercept : VEGF complex .
Once absorbed into the systemic circulation , aflibercept presents in the plasma as free aflibercept ( unbound to VEGF ) and a more predominant stable inactive form with circulating endogenous VEGF ( i . e . , aflibercept : VEGF complex ) .
Absorption / Distribution Following intravitreal administration of 2 mg per eye of EYLEA to patients with wet AMD , RVO , and DME , the mean Cmax of free aflibercept in the plasma was 0 . 02 mcg / mL ( range : 0 to 0 . 054 mcg / mL ) , 0 . 05 mcg / mL ( range : 0 to 0 . 081 mcg / mL ) , and 0 . 03 mcg / mL ( range : 0 to 0 . 076 mcg / mL ) , respectively and was attained in 1 to 3 days .
The free aflibercept plasma concentrations were undetectable two weeks post - dosing in all patients .
Aflibercept did not accumulate in plasma when administered as repeated doses intravitreally every 4 weeks .
It is estimated that after intravitreal administration of 2 mg to patients , the mean maximum plasma concentration of free aflibercept is more than 100 fold lower than the concentration of aflibercept required to half - maximally bind systemic VEGF .
The volume of distribution of free aflibercept following intravenous ( I . V . ) administration of aflibercept has been determined to be approximately 6 L .
Metabolism / Elimination Aflibercept is a therapeutic protein and no drug metabolism studies have been conducted .
Aflibercept is expected to undergo elimination through both target - mediated disposition via binding to free endogenous VEGF and metabolism via proteolysis .
The terminal elimination half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of free aflibercept in plasma was approximately 5 to 6 days after I . V . administration of doses of 2 to 4 mg / kg aflibercept .
Specific Populations Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetic analysis of a subgroup of patients ( n = 492 ) in one wet AMD study , of which 43 % had renal impairment ( mild n = 120 , moderate n = 74 , and severe n = 16 ) , revealed no differences with respect to plasma concentrations of free aflibercept after intravitreal administration every 4 or 8 weeks .
Similar results were seen in patients in a RVO study and in patients in a DME study .
No dose adjustment based on renal impairment status is needed for either wet AMD , RVO , or DME patients .
Other No special dosage modification is required for any of the populations that have been studied ( e . g . , gender , elderly ) .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No studies have been conducted on the mutagenic or carcinogenic potential of aflibercept .
Effects on male and female fertility were assessed as part of a 6 - month study in monkeys with intravenous administration of aflibercept at weekly doses ranging from 3 to 30 mg per kg .
Absent or irregular menses associated with alterations in female reproductive hormone levels and changes in sperm morphology and motility were observed at all dose levels .
In addition , females showed decreased ovarian and uterine weight accompanied by compromised luteal development and reduction of maturing follicles .
These changes correlated with uterine and vaginal atrophy .
A No Observed Adverse Effect Level ( NOAEL ) was not identified .
Intravenous administration of the lowest dose of aflibercept assessed in monkeys ( 3 mg per kg ) resulted in systemic exposure ( AUC ) for free aflibercept that was approximately 1500 times higher than the systemic exposure observed in humans after an intravitreal dose of 2 mg .
All changes were reversible within 20 weeks after cessation of treatment .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Erosions and ulcerations of the respiratory epithelium in nasal turbinates in monkeys treated with aflibercept intravitreally were observed at intravitreal doses of 2 or 4 mg per eye .
At the NOAEL of 0 . 5 mg per eye in monkeys , the systemic exposure ( AUC ) was 56 times higher than the exposure observed in humans after an intravitreal dose of 2 mg .
Similar effects were not seen in clinical studies [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Neovascular ( Wet ) Age - Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) The safety and efficacy of EYLEA were assessed in two randomized , multi - center , double - masked , active - controlled studies in patients with wet AMD .
A total of 2412 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy ( 1817 with EYLEA ) in the two studies ( VIEW1 and VIEW2 ) .
In each study , up to week 52 , patients were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 : 1 : 1 ratio to 1 of 4 dosing regimens : 1 ) EYLEA administered 2 mg every 8 weeks following 3 initial monthly doses ( EYLEA 2Q8 ) ; 2 ) EYLEA administered 2 mg every 4 weeks ( EYLEA 2Q4 ) ; 3 ) EYLEA 0 . 5 mg administered every 4 weeks ( EYLEA 0 . 5Q4 ) ; and 4 ) ranibizumab administered 0 . 5 mg every 4 weeks ( ranibizumab 0 . 5 mg Q4 ) .
Protocol - specified visits occurred every 28 ± 3 days .
Patient ages ranged from 49 to 99 years with a mean of 76 years .
In both studies , the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who maintained vision , defined as losing fewer than 15 letters of visual acuity at week 52 compared to baseline .
Both EYLEA 2Q8 and EYLEA 2Q4 groups were shown to have efficacy that was clinically equivalent to the ranibizumab 0 . 5 mg Q4 group in year 1 .
Detailed results from the analysis of the VIEW1 and VIEW2 studies are shown in Table 4 and Figure 13 below .

Figure 13 : Mean Change in Visual Acuity from Baseline to Week 96 [ 1 ] in VIEW1 and VIEW2 Studies [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ 1 ] Patient dosing schedules were individualized from weeks 52 to 96 using a modified 12 - week dosing regimen .
VIEW1 and VIEW2 studies were both 96 weeks in duration .
However after 52 weeks patients no longer followed a fixed dosing schedule .
Between week 52 and week 96 , patients continued to receive the drug and dosage strength to which they were initially randomized on a modified 12 week dosing schedule ( doses at least every 12 weeks and additional doses as needed ) .
Therefore , during the second year of these studies there was no active control comparison arm .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Macular Edema Following Central Retinal Vein Occlusion ( CRVO ) The safety and efficacy of EYLEA were assessed in two randomized , multi - center , double - masked , sham - controlled studies in patients with macular edema following CRVO .
A total of 358 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy ( 217 with EYLEA ) in the two studies ( COPERNICUS and GALILEO ) .
In both studies , patients were randomly assigned in a 3 : 2 ratio to either 2 mg EYLEA administered every 4 weeks ( 2Q4 ) , or sham injections ( control group ) administered every 4 weeks for a total of 6 injections .
Protocol - specified visits occurred every 28 ± 7 days .
Patient ages ranged from 22 to 89 years with a mean of 64 years .
In both studies , the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who gained at least 15 letters in BCVA compared to baseline .
At week 24 , the EYLEA 2 mg Q4 group was superior to the control group for the primary endpoint .
Results from the analysis of the COPERNICUS and GALILEO studies are shown in Table 5 and Figure 14 below .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 3 Macular Edema Following Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion ( BRVO ) The safety and efficacy of EYLEA were assessed in a 24 - week , randomized , multi - center , double - masked , controlled study in patients with macular edema following BRVO .
A total of 181 patients were treated and evaluable for efficacy ( 91 with EYLEA ) in the VIBRANT study .
In the study , patients were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to either 2 mg EYLEA administered every 4 weeks ( 2Q4 ) or laser photocoagulation administered at baseline and subsequently as needed ( control group ) .
Protocol - specified visits occurred every 28 ± 7 days .
Patient ages ranged from 42 to 94 years with a mean of 65 years .
In the VIBRANT study , the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who gained at least 15 letters in BCVA at week 24 compared to baseline .
At week 24 , the EYLEA 2 mg Q4 group was superior to the control group for the primary endpoint .
Detailed results from the analysis of the VIBRANT study are shown in Table 6 and Figure 15 below .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 4 Diabetic Macular Edema ( DME ) The safety and efficacy of EYLEA were assessed in two randomized , multi - center , double - masked , controlled studies in patients with DME .
A total of 862 randomized and treated patients were evaluable for efficacy .
Protocol - specified visits occurred every 28 ± 7 days .
Patient ages ranged from 23 to 87 years with a mean of 63 years .
Of those , 576 were randomized to EYLEA groups in the two studies ( VIVID and VISTA ) .
In each study , patients were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio to 1 of 3 dosing regimens : 1 ) EYLEA administered 2 mg every 8 weeks following 5 initial monthly injections ( EYLEA 2Q8 ) ; 2 ) EYLEA administered 2 mg every 4 weeks ( EYLEA 2Q4 ) ; and 3 ) macular laser photocoagulation ( at baseline and then as needed ) .
Beginning at week 24 , patients meeting a pre - specified threshold of vision loss were eligible to receive additional treatment : patients in the EYLEA groups could receive laser and patients in the laser group could receive EYLEA .
In both studies , the primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in BCVA at week 52 as measured by ETDRS letter score .
Efficacy of both EYLEA 2Q8 and EYLEA 2Q4 groups was statistically superior to the control group .
This statistically superior improvement in BCVA was maintained at week 100 in both studies .
Results from the analysis of the VIVID and VISTA studies are shown in Table 7 and Figure 16 below .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 5 Diabetic Retinopathy ( DR ) Efficacy and safety data of EYLEA in diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) are derived from the VIVID , VISTA , and PANORAMA studies .
VIVID AND VISTA In the VIVID and VISTA studies , an efficacy outcome was the change in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale ( ETDRS - DRSS ) .
The ETDRS - DRSS score was assessed at baseline and approximately every 6 months thereafter for the duration of the studies [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
All enrolled patients had DR and DME at baseline .
The majority of patients enrolled in these studies ( 77 % ) had moderate - to - severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy ( NPDR ) based on the ETDRS - DRSS .
At week 100 , the proportion of patients improving by at least 2 steps on the ETDRS - DRSS was significantly greater in both EYLEA treatment groups ( 2Q4 and 2Q8 ) when compared to the control group .
Results from the analysis of ETDRS - DRSS at week 100 in the VIVID and VISTA studies are shown in Table 8 below .

PANORAMA The PANORAMA study assessed the safety and efficacy of EYLEA in a randomized , multi - center , double - masked , controlled study in patients with moderately severe to severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy ( NPDR ) ( ETDRS - DRSS of 47 or 53 ) , without central - involved DME ( CI - DME ) .
A total of 402 randomized patients were evaluable for efficacy .
Protocol - specified visits occurred every 28 ± 7 days for the first 5 visits , then every 8 weeks ( 56 ± 7 days ) .
Patient ages ranged from 25 to 85 years with a mean of 55 . 7 years .
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio to 1 of 3 dosing regimens : 1 ) 3 initial monthly EYLEA 2 mg injections followed by one injection after 8 weeks and then one injection every 16 weeks ( EYLEA 2Q16 ) ; 2 ) 5 monthly EYLEA 2 mg injections followed by one injection every 8 weeks ( EYLEA 2Q8 ) ; and 3 ) sham treatment .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients who improved by ≥ 2 steps on the DRSS from baseline to week 24 in the combined EYLEA groups and at week 52 in the 2Q16 and 2Q8 groups individually versus sham .
A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients developing the composite endpoint of proliferative diabetic retinopathy or anterior segment neovascularization through week 52 .
At week 52 , efficacy in the 2Q16 and 2Q8 groups was superior to the sham group ( see Table 9 and Table 10 ) .
The proportion of patients with a ≥ 2 - step improvement over time is shown in Figure 17 .
