1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE ORLISTAT is indicated for obesity management including weight loss and weight maintenance when used in conjunction with a reduced - calorie diet .
ORLISTAT is also indicated to reduce the risk for weight regain after prior weight loss .
ORLISTAT is indicated for obese patients with an initial body mass index ( BMI ) ≥ 30 kg / m 2 or ≥ 27 kg / m 2 in the presence of other risk factors ( e . g . , hypertension , diabetes , dyslipidemia ) .
Table 1 illustrates body mass index ( BMI ) according to a variety of weights and heights .
The BMI is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared .
For example , a person who weighs 180 lbs and is 5 ' 5 " would have a BMI of 30 .
Table 1 Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , kg / m 2 [ 1 ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ 1 ] Conversion Factors : Weight in lbs ÷ 2 . 2 = weight in kilograms ( kg ) Height in inches × 0 . 0254 = height in meters ( m ) 1 foot = 12 inches • ORLISTAT is a reversible inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases indicated for obesity management including weight loss and weight maintenance when used in conjunction with a reduced - calorie diet .
( 1 ) • ORLISTAT is also indicated to reduce the risk for weight regain after prior weight loss .
( 1 ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • One 120 - mg capsule three times a day with each main meal containing fat ( during or up to 1 hour after the meal ) .
( 2 ) • Advise patients to take a nutritionally balanced , reduced - calorie diet that contains approximately 30 % of calories from fat .
( 2 ) • Distribute the daily intake of fat , carbohydrate , and protein over three main meals .
( 2 ) • Advise patients to take a multivitamin containing fat - soluble vitamins to ensure adequate nutrition .
( 2 ) • Take the vitamin supplement at least 2 hours before or after the administration of ORLISTAT , such as at bedtime .
( 2 ) • For patients receiving both ORLISTAT and cyclosporine therapy , administer cyclosporine 3 hours after ORLISTAT .
( 2 ) • For patients receiving both ORLISTAT and levothyroxine therapy , administer levothyroxine and ORLISTAT at least 4 hours apart .
( 2 ) 2 . 1 Recommended Dosing The recommended dose of ORLISTAT is one 120 - mg capsule three times a day with each main meal containing fat ( during or up to 1 hour after the meal ) .
The patient should be on a nutritionally balanced , reduced - calorie diet that contains approximately 30 % of calories from fat .
The daily intake of fat , carbohydrate , and protein should be distributed over three main meals .
If a meal is occasionally missed or contains no fat , the dose of ORLISTAT can be omitted .
Because ORLISTAT has been shown to reduce the absorption of some fat - soluble vitamins and beta - carotene , patients should be counseled to take a multivitamin containing fat - soluble vitamins to ensure adequate nutrition [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The vitamin supplement should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the administration of ORLISTAT , such as at bedtime .
For patients receiving both ORLISTAT and cyclosporine therapy , administer cyclosporine 3 hours after ORLISTAT .
For patients receiving both ORLISTAT and levothyroxine therapy , administer levothyroxine and ORLISTAT at least 4 hours apart .
Patients treated concomitantly with ORLISTAT and levothyroxine should be monitored for changes in thyroid function .
Doses above 120 mg three times a day have not been shown to provide additional benefit .
Based on fecal fat measurements , the effect of ORLISTAT is seen as soon as 24 to 48 hours after dosing .
Upon discontinuation of therapy , fecal fat content usually returns to pretreatment levels within 48 to 72 hours .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS ORLISTAT 120 mg turquoise capsules imprinted with XENICAL 120 in black ink .
• Capsules : 120 mg .
( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS ORLISTAT is contraindicated in : • Pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] • Patients with chronic malabsorption syndrome • Patients with cholestasis • Patients with known hypersensitivity to ORLISTAT or to any component of this product • Pregnancy ( 4 , 8 . 1 ) • Chronic malabsorption syndrome ( 4 ) • Cholestasis ( 4 ) • Known hypersensitivity to ORLISTAT or to any component of this product ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • ORLISTAT has drug interactions and can decrease vitamin absorption .
( 5 . 1 , 7 ) • Take a multivitamin supplement that contains fat - soluble vitamins to ensure adequate nutrition .
( 5 . 1 ) • Rare cases of severe liver injury with hepatocellular necrosis or acute hepatic failure have been reported .
( 5 . 2 ) • Patients may develop oxalate nephrolithiasis and oxalate nephropathy following treatment with ORLISTAT .
Monitor renal function in patients at risk for renal insufficiency .
Discontinue ORLISTAT if oxalate nephropathy develops .
( 5 . 3 ) • Substantial weight loss can increase the risk of cholelithiasis .
( 5 . 4 ) • Exclude organic causes of obesity ( eg , hypothyroidism ) before prescribing ORLISTAT .
( 5 . 5 ) • Gastrointestinal events may increase when ORLISTAT is taken with a diet high in fat ( > 30 % total daily calories from fat ) .
( 5 . 5 ) 5 . 1 Drug Interactions and Decreased Vitamin Absorption ORLISTAT may interact with concomitant drugs including cyclosporine , levothyroxine , warfarin , amiodarone , antiepileptic drugs , and antiretroviral drugs [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Data from a ORLISTAT and cyclosporine drug interaction study indicate a reduction in cyclosporine plasma levels when ORLISTAT was coadministered with cyclosporine .
Therefore , ORLISTAT and cyclosporine should not be simultaneously coadministered .
To reduce the chance of a drug - drug interaction , cyclosporine should be taken at least 3 hours before or after ORLISTAT in patients taking both drugs .
In addition , in those patients whose cyclosporine levels are being measured , more frequent monitoring should be considered .
Patients should be strongly encouraged to take a multivitamin supplement that contains fat - soluble vitamins to ensure adequate nutrition because ORLISTAT has been shown to reduce the absorption of some fat - soluble vitamins and beta - carotene [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) , and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In addition , the levels of vitamin D and beta - carotene may be low in obese patients compared with non - obese subjects .
The supplement should be taken once a day at least 2 hours before or after the administration of ORLISTAT , such as at bedtime .
Weight - loss may affect glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus .
A reduction in dose of oral hypoglycemic medication ( e . g . , sulfonylureas ) or insulin may be required in some patients [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
5 . 2 Liver Injury There have been rare postmarketing reports of severe liver injury with hepatocellular necrosis or acute hepatic failure in patients treated with ORLISTAT , with some of these cases resulting in liver transplant or death .
Patients should be instructed to report any symptoms of hepatic dysfunction ( anorexia , pruritus , jaundice , dark urine , light - colored stools , or right upper quadrant pain ) while taking ORLISTAT .
When these symptoms occur , ORLISTAT and other suspect medications should be discontinued immediately and liver function tests and ALT and AST levels obtained .
5 . 3 Oxalate Nephrolithiasis and Oxalate Nephropathy with Renal Failure Some patients may develop increased levels of urinary oxalate following treatment with ORLISTAT .
Cases of oxalate nephrolithiasis and oxalate nephropathy with renal failure have been reported .
Monitor renal function when prescribing ORLISTAT to patients at increased risk for oxalate nephropathy , including patients with renal impairment and in those with a history of hyperoxaluria or calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis .
Discontinue ORLISTAT in patients who develop oxalate nephropathy .
5 . 4 Cholelithiasis Substantial weight loss can increase the risk of cholelithiasis .
In a clinical trial of ORLISTAT for the prevention of type 2 diabetes , the rates of cholelithiasis as an adverse event were 2 . 9 % ( 47 / 1649 ) for patients randomized to ORLISTAT and 1 . 8 % ( 30 / 1655 ) for patients randomized to placebo .
5 . 5 Miscellaneous Organic causes of obesity ( e . g . , hypothyroidism ) should be excluded before prescribing ORLISTAT .
Patients should be advised to adhere to dietary guidelines [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Gastrointestinal events [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] may increase when ORLISTAT is taken with a diet high in fat ( > 30 % total daily calories from fat ) .
The daily intake of fat should be distributed over three main meals .
If ORLISTAT is taken with any one meal very high in fat , the possibility of gastrointestinal effects increases .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common treatment emergent adverse reactions ( ≥ 5 % and at least twice that of placebo ) include oily spotting , flatus with discharge , fecal urgency , fatty / oily stool , oily evacuation , increased defecation and fecal incontinence .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact the Safety Call Center at 1 - 877 - 778 - 8969 or FDA at 1 ‑ 800 ‑ FDA ‑ 1088 ( 1 - 800 - 332 - 1088 ) or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in patients .
Commonly Observed ( based on first year and second year data ) Gastrointestinal ( GI ) symptoms were the most commonly observed treatment - emergent adverse events associated with the use of ORLISTAT in the seven double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trials and are primarily a manifestation of the mechanism of action .
( Commonly observed is defined as an incidence of ≥ 5 % and an incidence in the ORLISTAT 120 mg group that is at least twice that of placebo . )

In general , the first occurrence of these events was within 3 months of starting therapy .
Overall , approximately 50 % of all episodes of GI adverse events associated with ORLISTAT treatment lasted for less than 1 week , and a majority lasted for no more than 4 weeks .
However , GI adverse events may occur in some individuals over a period of 6 months or longer .
Discontinuation of Treatment In controlled clinical trials , 8 . 8 % of patients treated with ORLISTAT discontinued treatment due to adverse events , compared with 5 . 0 % of placebo - treated patients .
For ORLISTAT , the most common adverse events resulting in discontinuation of treatment were gastrointestinal .
Other Adverse Clinical Events The following table lists other treatment - emergent adverse events from seven multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trials that occurred at a frequency of ≥ 2 % among patients treated with ORLISTAT 120 mg three times a day and with an incidence that was greater than placebo during year 1 and year 2 , regardless of relationship to study medication .

In clinical trials in obese diabetic patients , hypoglycemia and abdominal distension were also observed .
Pediatric Patients In clinical trials with ORLISTAT in adolescent patients ages 12 to 16 years , the profile of adverse reactions was generally similar to that observed in adults .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ORLISTAT .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to ORLISTAT exposure .
• Rare cases of increase in transaminases and in alkaline phosphatase and hepatitis that may be serious have been reported .
There have been reports of hepatic failure observed with the use of ORLISTAT in postmarketing surveillance , with some of these cases resulting in liver transplant or death [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
• Rare cases of hypersensitivity have been reported with the use of ORLISTAT .
Signs and symptoms have included pruritus , rash , urticaria , angioedema , bronchospasm and anaphylaxis .
Very rare cases of bullous eruption have been reported .
• Rare cases of leukocytoclastic vasculitis have been reported .
Clinical signs include palpable purpura , maculopapular lesions , or bullous eruption .
• Acute oxalate nephropathy after treatment with ORLISTAT has been reported in patients with or at risk for renal disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
• Pancreatitis has been reported with the use of ORLISTAT in postmarketing surveillance .
No causal relationship or physiopathological mechanism between pancreatitis and obesity therapy has been definitively established .
• Lower gastrointestinal bleeding has been reported in patients treated with ORLISTAT .
Most reports are nonserious ; severe or persistent cases should be investigated further .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Cyclosporine : Reduction in cyclosporine plasma levels was observed when ORLISTAT was coadministered with cyclosporine .
( 7 . 1 ) • Fat - soluble Vitamin Supplements and Analogues : All patients should take a daily multivitamin that contains vitamins A , D , E , K , and beta - carotene .
( 7 . 2 ) • Levothyroxine : Patients treated concomitantly with ORLISTAT and levothyroxine should be monitored for changes in thyroid function .
( 7 . 3 ) • Warfarin : Patients on chronic stable doses of warfarin who are prescribed ORLISTAT should be monitored closely for changes in coagulation parameters .
( 7 . 4 ) • Amiodarone : A reduction in exposure to amiodarone was observed when ORLISTAT was co - administered .
( 7 . 5 ) • Antiepileptic Drugs : Convulsions have been reported in patients taking ORLISTAT with antiepileptic drugs .
Patients should be monitored for possible changes in frequency or severity of convulsions .
( 7 . 6 ) • Antiretroviral Drugs : Loss of virological control has been reported in HIV - infected patients .
Patients should be monitored frequently for changes in HIV RNA levels .
( 7 . 7 ) 7 . 1 Cyclosporine Data from a ORLISTAT and cyclosporine drug interaction study indicate a reduction in cyclosporine plasma levels when ORLISTAT was coadministered with cyclosporine .
ORLISTAT and cyclosporine should not be simultaneously coadministered .
Cyclosporine should be administered 3 hours after the administration of ORLISTAT [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) , and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
7 . 2 Fat - soluble Vitamin Supplements and Analogues Data from a pharmacokinetic interaction study showed that the absorption of beta - carotene supplement is reduced when concomitantly administered with ORLISTAT .
ORLISTAT inhibited absorption of a vitamin E acetate supplement .
The effect of ORLISTAT on the absorption of supplemental vitamin D , vitamin A , and nutritionally - derived vitamin K is not known at this time [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
7 . 3 Levothyroxine Hypothyroidism has been reported in patients treated concomitantly with ORLISTAT and levothyroxine postmarketing .
Patients treated concomitantly with ORLISTAT and levothyroxine should be monitored for changes in thyroid function .
Administer levothyroxine and ORLISTAT at least 4 hours apart [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
7 . 4 Anticoagulants including Warfarin Vitamin K absorption may be decreased with ORLISTAT .
Reports of decreased prothrombin , increased INR and unbalanced anticoagulant treatment resulting in change of hemostatic parameters have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with ORLISTAT and anticoagulants .
Patients on chronic stable doses of warfarin or other anticoagulants who are prescribed ORLISTAT should be monitored closely for changes in coagulation parameters [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 5 Amiodarone A pharmacokinetic study , where amiodarone was orally administered during orlistat treatment , demonstrated a reduction in exposure to amiodarone and its metabolite , desethylamiodarone [ see Clinical Pharmocology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
A reduced therapeutic effect of amiodarone is possible .
The effect of commencing orlistat treatment in patients on stable amiodarone therapy has not been studied .
7 . 6 Antiepileptic Drugs Convulsions have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and antiepileptic drugs .
Patients should be monitored for possible changes in the frequency and / or severity of convulsions .
7 . 7 Antiretroviral Drugs Loss of virological control has been reported in HIV - infected patients taking orlistat concomitantly with antiretroviral drugs such as atazanavir , ritonavir , tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , emtricitabine , and with the combinations lopinavir / ritonavir and emtricitabine / efavirenz / tenofovir disoproxil fumarate .
The exact mechanism for this is unclear , but may include a drug - drug interaction that inhibits systemic absorption of the antiretroviral drug .
HIV RNA levels should be frequently monitored in patients who take ORLISTAT while being treated for HIV infection .
If there is a confirmed increase in HIV viral load , ORLISTAT should be discontinued .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Nursing Mothers : Caution should be exercised when administered to a nursing woman .
( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X ORLISTAT is contraindicated during pregnancy , because weight loss offers no potential benefit to a pregnant woman and may result in fetal harm .
A minimum weight gain , and no weight loss , is currently recommended for all pregnant women , including those who are already overweight or obese , due to the obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy .
No embryotoxicity or teratogenicity was seen in animals that received orlistat at doses much higher than the recommended human dose .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard of maternal weight loss to the fetus .
Animal Data Reproduction studies were conducted in rats and rabbits at doses up to 800 mg / kg / day .
Neither study showed embryotoxicity or teratogenicity .
This dose is 23 and 47 times the daily human dose calculated on a body surface area ( mg / m 2 ) basis for rats and rabbits , respectively .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known if ORLISTAT is present in human milk .
Caution should be exercised when ORLISTAT is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 have not been established .
The safety and efficacy of ORLISTAT have been evaluated in obese adolescent patients aged 12 to 16 years .
Use of ORLISTAT in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies of ORLISTAT in adults with additional data from a 54 - week efficacy and safety study and a 21 - day mineral balance study in obese adolescent patients aged 12 to 16 years .
Patients treated with ORLISTAT in the 54 - week efficacy and safety study ( 64 . 8 % female , 75 % Caucasians , 18 . 8 % Blacks , and 6 . 3 % Other ) had a mean reduction in BMI of 0 . 55 kg / m 2 compared with an average increase of 0 . 31 kg / m 2 in placebo - treated patients ( p = 0 . 001 ) .
In both adolescent studies , adverse effects were generally similar to those described in adults and included fatty / oily stool , oily spotting , and oily evacuation .
In a subgroup of 152 ORLISTAT and 77 placebo patients from the 54 - week study , changes in body composition measured by DEXA were similar in both treatment groups with the exception of fat mass , which was significantly reduced in patients treated with ORLISTAT compared to patients treated with placebo ( - 2 . 5 kg vs - 0 . 6 kg , p = 0 . 033 ) .
Because ORLISTAT can interfere with the absorption of fat - soluble vitamins , all patients should take a daily multivitamin that contains vitamins A , D , E , K , and beta - carotene .
The vitamin supplement should be taken at least 2 hours before or after ORLISTAT [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Plasma concentrations of orlistat and its metabolites M1 and M3 were similar to those found in adults at the same dose level .
Daily fecal fat excretions were 27 % and 7 % of dietary intake in ORLISTAT and placebo treatment groups , respectively .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ORLISTAT did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9 . 2 Abuse As with any weight - loss agent , the potential exists for abuse of ORLISTAT in inappropriate patient populations ( e . g . , patients with anorexia nervosa or bulimia ) .
See Indications and Usage ( 1 ) for recommended prescribing guidelines .
10 OVERDOSAGE Single doses of 800 mg ORLISTAT and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day for 15 days have been studied in normal weight and obese subjects without significant adverse findings .
Should a significant overdose of ORLISTAT occur , it is recommended that the patient be observed for 24 hours .
Based on human and animal studies , systemic effects attributable to the lipase - inhibiting properties of ORLISTAT should be rapidly reversible .
11 DESCRIPTION ORLISTAT is a gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor for obesity management that acts by inhibiting the absorption of dietary fats .
Orlistat is ( S ) - 2 - formylamino - 4 - methyl - pentanoic acid ( S ) - 1 - [ [ ( 2 S , 3 S ) - 3 - hexyl - 4 - oxo - 2 - oxetanyl ] methyl ] - dodecyl ester .
Its empirical formula is C 29 H 53 NO 5 , and its molecular weight is 495 . 7 .
It is a single diastereomeric molecule that contains four chiral centers , with a negative optical rotation in ethanol at 529 nm .
The structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Orlistat is a white to off - white crystalline powder .
Orlistat is practically insoluble in water , freely soluble in chloroform , and very soluble in methanol and ethanol .
Orlistat has no p Ka within the physiological pH range .
ORLISTAT is available for oral administration as a turquoise hard - gelatin capsule .
The capsule is imprinted with black .
Each capsule contains a pellet formulation consisting of 120 mg of the active ingredient , orlistat , as well as the inactive ingredients microcrystalline cellulose , sodium starch glycolate , sodium lauryl sulfate , povidone , and talc .
The capsule shell contains gelatin , titanium dioxide , and FD & C Blue No . 2 with black printing ink containing pharmaceutical grade shellac , propylene glycol , strong ammonium solution , potassium hydroxide and black iron oxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Orlistat is a reversible inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases .
It exerts its therapeutic activity in the lumen of the stomach and small intestine by forming a covalent bond with the active serine residue site of gastric and pancreatic lipases .
The inactivated enzymes are thus unavailable to hydrolyze dietary fat in the form of triglycerides into absorbable free fatty acids and monoglycerides .
As undigested triglycerides are not absorbed , the resulting caloric deficit may have a positive effect on weight control .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Dose - response Relationship The dose - response relationship for orlistat in human volunteers is shown in Figure 1 .
The effect is the percentage of ingested fat excreted , referred to as fecal fat excretion percentage .
Both individual data ( open circles ) and the curve predicted for the population with the maximum - effect model ( continuous line ) are shown in Figure 1 .
Figure 1 Dose - Response Relationship for Orlistat in Human Volunteers [ MULTIMEDIA ] At the recommended therapeutic dose of 120 mg three times a day , orlistat inhibits dietary fat absorption by approximately 30 % .
Ethanol does not affect orlistat ' s effect on preventing the absorption of fat .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Other Short - term Studies Adults In several studies of up to 6 - weeks duration , the effects of therapeutic doses of ORLISTAT on gastrointestinal and systemic physiological processes were assessed in normal weight and obese subjects .
Postprandial cholecystokinin plasma concentrations were lowered after multiple doses of ORLISTAT in two studies but not significantly different from placebo in two other experiments .
There were no clinically significant changes observed in gallbladder motility , bile composition or lithogenicity , or colonic cell proliferation rate , and no clinically significant reduction of gastric emptying time or gastric acidity .
In addition , no effects on plasma triglyceride levels or systemic lipases were observed with the administration of ORLISTAT in these studies .
In a 3 - week study of 28 healthy male volunteers , ORLISTAT ( 120 mg three times a day ) did not significantly affect the balance of calcium , magnesium , phosphorus , zinc , copper , and iron .
Pediatrics In a 3 - week study of 32 obese adolescents aged 12 to 16 years , ORLISTAT ( 120 mg three times a day ) did not significantly affect the balance of calcium , magnesium , phosphorus , zinc , or copper .
The iron balance was decreased by 64 . 7 µmole / 24 hours and 40 . 4 µmole / 24 hours in ORLISTAT and placebo treatment groups , respectively .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Systemic exposure to orlistat is minimal .
Following oral dosing with 360 mg 14 C - orlistat , plasma radioactivity peaked at approximately 8 hours ; plasma concentrations of intact orlistat were near the limits of detection ( < 5 ng / mL ) .
In therapeutic studies involving monitoring of plasma samples , detection of intact orlistat in plasma was sporadic and concentrations were low ( < 10 ng / mL or 0 . 02 µM ) , without evidence of accumulation , and consistent with minimal absorption .
Distribution In vitro orlistat was > 99 % bound to plasma proteins ( lipoproteins and albumin were major binding proteins ) .
Orlistat minimally partitioned into erythrocytes .
Metabolism Based on an oral 14 C - orlistat mass balance study in obese patients , two metabolites , M1 ( ( the hydrolyzed β - lactone ring product of orlistat ) and M3 ( sequential metabolite after M1 ' s cleavage of the N - formyl leucine side - chain ) , accounted for approximately 42 % of total radioactivity in plasma .
M1 and M3 have an open β - lactone ring and extremely weak lipase inhibitory activity ( 1000 - and 2500 - fold less than orlistat , respectively ) .
In view of this low inhibitory activity and the low plasma levels at the therapeutic dose ( average of 26 ng / mL and 108 ng / mL for M1 and M3 , respectively , 2 to 4 hours after a dose ) , these metabolites are considered pharmacologically inconsequential .
The primary metabolite M1 had a short half - life ( approximately 3 hours ) whereas the secondary metabolite M3 eliminated at a slower rate ( half - life approximately 13 . 5 hours ) .
Elimination Following a single oral dose of 360 mg 14 C - orlistat in both normal weight and obese subjects , fecal excretion of the unabsorbed drug was found to be the major route of elimination .
Orlistat and its M1 and M3 metabolites were also subject to biliary excretion .
Approximately 97 % of the administered radioactivity was excreted in feces ; 83 % of that was found to be unchanged orlistat .
The cumulative renal excretion of total radioactivity was < 2 % of the given dose of 360 mg 14 C - orlistat .
The time to reach complete excretion ( fecal plus urinary ) was 3 to 5 days .
The disposition of orlistat appeared to be similar between normal weight and obese subjects .
Based on limited data , the half - life of the absorbed orlistat is in the range of 1 to 2 hours .
Specific Populations No pharmacokinetic study was conducted for specific populations such as geriatric , different races , and patients with renal and hepatic impairment .
Drug Interactions Alcohol In a multiple - dose study in 30 normal - weight subjects , coadministration of ORLISTAT and 40 grams of alcohol ( e . g . , approximately 3 glasses of wine ) did not result in alteration of alcohol pharmacokinetics , orlistat pharmacodynamics ( fecal fat excretion ) , or systemic exposure to orlistat .
Amiodarone In a pharmacokinetic study conducted in healthy volunteers who received 120 mg orlistat three times daily for 13 days and a single dose of 120 mg orlistat on the morning of Day 14 co - administered with a single dose of 1200 mg amiodarone on Day 4 , a 23 – 27 % reduction in the systemic exposure to amiodarone and desethylamiodarone was observed [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 5 ) ] .
The effect of commencing orlistat treatment in patients on stable amiodarone therapy has not been studied .
Cyclosporine In a multiple - dose study , coadministration of 50 mg cyclosporine twice daily with 120 mg ORLISTAT three times daily decreased cyclosporine AUC and C max by 31 % and 25 % , respectively .
In the same study , administration of 50 mg cyclosporine twice daily three hours after the administration of 120 mg ORLISTAT three times daily decreased cyclosporine AUC and C max by 17 % and 4 % , respectively .
Digoxin In 12 normal - weight subjects receiving ORLISTAT 120 mg three times a day for 6 days , ORLISTAT did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of digoxin .
Fat - soluble Vitamin Supplements and Analogues A pharmacokinetic interaction study showed a 30 % reduction in beta - carotene supplement absorption when concomitantly administered with ORLISTAT .
ORLISTAT inhibited absorption of a vitamin E acetate supplement by approximately 60 % .
The effect of ORLISTAT on the absorption of supplemental vitamin D , vitamin A , and nutritionally - derived vitamin K is not known at this time .
Glyburide In 12 normal - weight subjects receiving orlistat 80 mg three times a day for 5 days , orlistat did not alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics ( blood glucose - lowering ) of glyburide .
Nifedipine ( extended - release tablets ) In 17 normal - weight subjects receiving ORLISTAT 120 mg three times a day for 6 days , ORLISTAT did not alter the bioavailability of nifedipine ( extended - release tablets ) .
Oral Contraceptives In 20 normal - weight female subjects , the treatment of ORLISTAT 120 mg three times a day for 23 days resulted in no changes in the ovulation - suppressing action of oral contraceptives .
Phenytoin In 12 normal - weight subjects receiving ORLISTAT 120 mg three times a day for 7 days , ORLISTAT did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single 300 - mg dose of phenytoin .
Pravastatin In a 2 - way crossover study of 24 normal - weight , mildly hypercholesterolemic patients receiving ORLISTAT 120 mg three times a day for 6 days , ORLISTAT did not affect the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin .
Warfarin In 12 normal - weight subjects , administration of ORLISTAT 120 mg three times a day for 16 days did not result in any change in either warfarin pharmacokinetics ( both R - and S - enantiomers ) or pharmacodynamics ( prothrombin time and serum Factor VII ) .
Although undercarboxylated osteocalcin , a marker of vitamin K nutritional status , was unaltered with ORLISTAT administration , vitamin K levels tended to decline in subjects taking ORLISTAT .
Therefore , as vitamin K absorption may be decreased with ORLISTAT , patients on chronic stable doses of warfarin who are prescribed ORLISTAT should be monitored closely for changes in coagulation parameters .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice did not show a carcinogenic potential for orlistat at doses up to 1000 mg / kg / day and 1500 mg / kg / day , respectively .
For mice and rats , these doses are 38 and 46 times the daily human dose calculated on an area under concentration vs time curve basis of total drug - related material .
Orlistat had no detectable mutagenic or genotoxic activity as determined by the Ames test , a mammalian forward mutation assay ( V79 / HPRT ) , an in vitro clastogenesis assay in peripheral human lymphocytes , an unscheduled DNA synthesis assay ( UDS ) in rat hepatocytes in culture , and an in vivo mouse micronucleus test .
When given to rats at a dose of 400 mg / kg / day in a fertility and reproduction study , orlistat had no observable adverse effects .
This dose is 12 times the daily human dose calculated on a body surface area ( mg / m 2 ) basis .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The long - term effects of ORLISTAT on morbidity and mortality associated with obesity have not been established .
The effects of ORLISTAT on weight loss , weight maintenance , and weight regain and on a number of comorbidities ( e . g . , type 2 diabetes , lipids , blood pressure ) were assessed in the 4 - year XENDOS study and in seven long - term ( 1 - to 2 - years duration ) multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trials .
During the first year of therapy , the studies of 2 - year duration assessed weight loss and weight maintenance .
During the second year of therapy , some studies assessed continued weight loss and weight maintenance and others assessed the effect of ORLISTAT on weight regain .
These studies included over 2800 patients treated with ORLISTAT and 1400 patients treated with placebo ( age range 17 - 78 years , 80 . 2 % women , 91 . 0 % Caucasians , 5 . 7 % Blacks , 2 . 3 % Hispanics , 0 . 9 % Other ) .
The majority of these patients had obesity - related risk factors and comorbidities .
In the XENDOS study , which included 3304 patients ( age range 30 - 58 years , 55 % women , 99 % Caucasians , 1 % other ) , the time to onset of type 2 diabetes was assessed in addition to weight management .
In all these studies , treatment with ORLISTAT and placebo designates treatment with ORLISTAT plus diet and placebo plus diet , respectively .
During the weight loss and weight maintenance period , a well - balanced , reduced - calorie diet that was intended to result in an approximate 20 % decrease in caloric intake and provide 30 % of calories from fat was recommended to all patients .
In addition , all patients were offered nutritional counseling .
14 . 1 One - year Results : Weight Loss , Weight Maintenance , and Risk Factors Pooled data from five clinical trials indicated that the overall mean weight loss from randomization to the end of 1 year of treatment in the intent - to - treat population was 13 . 4 lbs in the patients treated with ORLISTAT and 5 . 8 lbs in the placebo - treated patients .
After 1 year of treatment , the mean percent weight loss difference between ORLISTAT - treated patients and placebo - treated patients was 3 % .
One thousand seventy two ( 69 % ) patients treated with ORLISTAT and 701 ( 63 % ) patients treated with placebo completed 1 year of treatment .
Of the patients who completed 1 year of treatment , 57 % of the patients treated with ORLISTAT ( 120 mg three times a day ) and 31 % of the placebo - treated patients lost at least 5 % of their baseline body weight .
The percentages of patients achieving ≥ 5 % and ≥ 10 % weight loss after 1 year in five large multicenter studies for the intent - to - treat populations are presented in Table 6 .

Study 14161 was conducted with primary care physicians .
The relative changes in risk factors associated with obesity following 1 year of therapy with ORLISTAT and placebo are presented for the population as a whole and for the population with abnormal values at randomization .
Population as a Whole The changes in metabolic , cardiovascular and anthropometric risk factors associated with obesity based on pooled data for five clinical studies , regardless of the patient ' s risk factor status at randomization , are presented in Table 7 .
One year of therapy with ORLISTAT resulted in relative improvement in several risk factors .
Table 7 Mean Change in Risk Factors From Randomization Following 1 - Year Treatment [ 1 ] Population as a Whole Risk Factor Orlistat 120 mg [ 2 ] Placebo null Metabolic : Total Cholesterol - 2 . 0 % + 5 . 0 % LDL - Cholesterol - 4 . 0 % + 5 . 0 % HDL - Cholesterol + 9 . 3 % + 12 . 8 % LDL / HDL - 0 . 37 - 0 . 20 Triglycerides + 1 . 34 % + 2 . 9 % Fasting Glucose , mmol / L - 0 . 04 + 0 . 0 Fasting Insulin , pmol / L - 6 . 7 + 5 . 2 Cardiovascular : Systolic Blood Pressure , mm Hg - 1 . 01 + 0 . 58 Diastolic Blood Pressure , mm Hg - 1 . 19 + 0 . 46 Anthropometric : Waist Circumference , cm - 6 . 45 - 4 . 04 Hip Circumference , cm - 5 . 31 - 2 . 96 [ 1 ] Treatment designates ORLISTAT 120 mg three times a day plus diet or placebo plus diet [ 2 ] Intent - to - treat population at week 52 , observed data based on pooled data from 5 studies Population With Abnormal Risk Factors at Randomization The changes from randomization following 1 - year treatment in the population with abnormal lipid levels ( LDL ≥ 130 mg / dL , LDL / HDL ≥ 3 . 5 , HDL < 35 mg / dL ) were greater for ORLISTAT compared to placebo with respect to LDL - cholesterol ( - 7 . 83 % vs + 1 . 14 % ) and the LDL / HDL ratio ( - 0 . 64 vs - 0 . 46 ) .
HDL increased in the placebo group by 20 . 1 % and in the ORLISTAT group by 18 . 8 % .
In the population with abnormal blood pressure at baseline ( systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg ) , the change in SBP from randomization to 1 year was greater for ORLISTAT ( - 10 . 89 mm Hg ) than placebo ( - 5 . 07 mm Hg ) .
For patients with a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg , ORLISTAT patients decreased by - 7 . 9 mm Hg while the placebo patients decreased by - 5 . 5 mm Hg .
Fasting insulin decreased more for ORLISTAT than placebo ( - 39 vs - 16 pmol / L ) from randomization to 1 year in the population with abnormal baseline values ( ≥ 120 pmol / L ) .
A greater reduction in waist circumference for ORLISTAT vs placebo ( - 7 . 29 vs - 4 . 53 cm ) was observed in the population with abnormal baseline values ( ≥ 100 cm ) .
14 . 2 Effect on Weight Regain Three studies were designed to evaluate the effects of ORLISTAT compared to placebo in reducing weight regain after a previous weight loss achieved following either diet alone ( one study , 14302 ) or prior treatment with ORLISTAT ( two studies , 14119 C and 14185 ) .
The diet utilized during the 1 - year weight regain portion of the studies was a weight - maintenance diet , rather than a weight - loss diet , and patients received less nutritional counseling than patients in weight - loss studies .
For studies 14119 C and 14185 , patients ' previous weight loss was due to 1 year of treatment with ORLISTAT in conjunction with a mildly hypocaloric diet .
Study 14302 was conducted to evaluate the effects of 1 year of treatment with ORLISTAT on weight regain in patients who had lost 8 % or more of their body weight in the previous 6 months on diet alone .
In study 14119 C , patients treated with placebo regained 52 % of the weight they had previously lost while the patients treated with ORLISTAT regained 26 % of the weight they had previously lost ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
In study 14185 , patients treated with placebo regained 63 % of the weight they had previously lost while the patients treated with ORLISTAT regained 35 % of the weight they had lost ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
In study 14302 , patients treated with placebo regained 53 % of the weight they had previously lost while the patients treated with ORLISTAT regained 32 % of the weight that they had lost ( p < 0 . 001 ) .
14 . 3 Two - year Results : Long - term Weight Control and Risk Factors The treatment effects of ORLISTAT were examined for 2 years in four of the five 1 - year weight management clinical studies previously discussed ( see Table 6 ) .
At the end of year 1 , the patients ' diets were reviewed and changed where necessary .
The diet prescribed in the second year was designed to maintain patient ' s current weight .
ORLISTAT was shown to be more effective than placebo in long - term weight control in four large , multicenter , 2 - year double - blind , placebo - controlled studies .
Pooled data from four clinical studies indicate that 74 % of all patients treated with 120 mg three times a day of ORLISTAT and 76 % of patients treated with placebo completed 2 years of the same therapy .
Pooled data from four clinical studies indicate that the mean weight loss difference between ORLISTAT 120 mg three times a day and placebo treatment groups at year 2 in those patients who completed 1 year of treatment ( ITT LOCF ) was 3 % .
In the same studies cited in the One - year Results ( see Table 6 ) , the percentages of patients achieving a ≥ 5 % and ≥ 10 % weight loss after 2 years are shown in Table 8 .

Study 14161 was conducted with primary care physicians .
The relative changes in risk factors associated with obesity following 2 years of therapy were also assessed in the population as a whole and the population with abnormal risk factors at randomization .
Population as a Whole The relative differences in risk factors between treatment with ORLISTAT and placebo were similar to the results following 1 year of therapy for total cholesterol , LDL - cholesterol , LDL / HDL ratio , triglycerides , fasting glucose , fasting insulin , diastolic blood pressure , waist circumference , and hip circumference .
The relative differences between treatment groups for HDL cholesterol and systolic blood pressure were less than that observed in the year one results .
Population With Abnormal Risk Factors at Randomization The relative differences in risk factors between treatment with ORLISTAT and placebo were similar to the results following 1 year of therapy for LDL - and HDL - cholesterol , triglycerides , fasting insulin , diastolic blood pressure , and waist circumference .
The relative differences between treatment groups for LDL / HDL ratio and isolated systolic blood pressure were less than that observed in the year one results .
14 . 4 Four - year Results : Long - term Weight Control and Risk Factors In the 4 - year double - blind , placebo - controlled XENDOS study , the effects of ORLISTAT in delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes and on body weight were compared to placebo in 3304 obese patients who had either normal or impaired glucose tolerance at baseline .
Thirty - four percent of the 1655 patients who were randomized to the placebo group and 52 % of the 1649 patients who were randomized to the ORLISTAT group completed the 4 - year study .
At the end of the study , the mean percent weight loss in the placebo group was - 2 . 75 % compared with - 5 . 17 % in the ORLISTAT group ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( see Figure 2 ) .
Forty - five percent of the placebo patients and 73 % of the ORLISTAT patients lost ≥ 5 % of their baseline body weight , and 21 % of the placebo patients and 41 % of the ORLISTAT patients lost ≥ 10 % of their baseline body weight following the first year of treatment .
Following 4 years of treatment , 28 % of the placebo patients and 45 % of the ORLISTAT patients lost ≥ 5 % of their baseline body weight and 10 % of the placebo patients and 21 % of the ORLISTAT patients lost ≥ 10 % of their baseline body weight .
After 4 years of treatment , the mean % difference in weight loss between ORLISTAT treated patients and placebo was 2 . 5 % .
Figure 2 Mean Change from Baseline Body Weight ( Kgs ) Over Time * [ MULTIMEDIA ] * ITT LOCF study population The relative changes from baseline in risk factors associated with obesity following 4 years of therapy were assessed in the XENDOS study population ( see Table 9 ) .
Table 9 Mean Change in Risk Factors From Randomization Following 4 - Years Treatment [ 1 ] Risk Factor Orlistat 120 mg [ 2 ] Placebo null Metabolic : Total Cholesterol - 7 . 02 % - 2 . 03 % LDL - Cholesterol - 11 . 66 % - 3 . 85 % HDL - Cholesterol + 5 . 92 % + 7 . 01 % LDL / HDL - 0 . 53 - 0 . 33 Triglycerides + 3 . 64 % + 1 . 30 Fasting Glucose , mmol / L + 0 . 12 + 0 . 23 Fasting Insulin , pmol / L - 24 . 93 - 15 . 71 Cardiovascular : Systolic Blood Pressure , mm Hg - 4 . 12 - 2 . 60 Diastolic Blood Pressure , mm Hg - 1 . 93 - 0 . 87 Anthropometric : Waist Circumference , cm - 5 . 78 - 3 . 99 [ 1 ] Treatment designates ORLISTAT 120 mg three times a day plus diet or placebo plus diet [ 2 ] Intent - to - treat population [ MULTIMEDIA ] Onset of Type 2 Diabetes in Obese Patients In the XENDOS trial , in the overall population , ORLISTAT delayed the onset of type 2 diabetes such that at the end of four years of treatment the cumulative incidence rate of diabetes was 8 . 3 % for the placebo group compared to 5 . 5 % for the ORLISTAT group , p = 0 . 01 ( see Table 10 ) .
This finding was driven by a statistically - significant reduction in the incidence of developing type 2 diabetes in those patients who had impaired glucose tolerance at baseline ( Table 10 and Figure 3 ) .
ORLISTAT did not reduce the risk for the development of diabetes in patients with normal glucose tolerance at baseline .
The effect of ORLISTAT to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in obese patients with IGT is presumably due to weight loss , and not to any independent effects of the drug on glucose or insulin metabolism .
The effect of ORLISTAT on weight loss is adjunctive to diet and exercise .

Diastolic blood pressure decreased by - 0 . 47 mm Hg for ORLISTAT and by - 0 . 5 mm Hg for placebo , p > 0 . 05 .
14 . 6 Glucose Tolerance in Obese Patients Two - year studies that included oral glucose tolerance tests were conducted in obese patients not previously diagnosed or treated for type 2 diabetes and whose baseline oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) status at randomization was either normal , impaired , or diabetic .
The progression from a normal OGTT at randomization to a diabetic or impaired OGTT following 2 years of treatment with ORLISTAT ( n = 251 ) or placebo ( n = 207 ) were compared .
Following treatment with ORLISTAT , 0 . 0 % and 7 . 2 % of the patients progressed from normal to diabetic and normal to impaired , respectively , compared to 1 . 9 % and 12 . 6 % of the placebo treatment group , respectively .
In patients found to have an impaired OGTT at randomization , the percent of patients improving to normal or deteriorating to diabetic status following 1 and 2 years of treatment with ORLISTAT compared to placebo are presented .
After 1 year of treatment , 45 . 8 % of the placebo patients and 73 % of the ORLISTAT patients had a normal oral glucose tolerance test while 10 . 4 % of the placebo patients and 2 . 6 % of the ORLISTAT patients became diabetic .
After 2 years of treatment , 50 % of the placebo patients and 71 . 7 % of the ORLISTAT patients had a normal oral glucose tolerance test while 7 . 5 % of placebo patients were found to be diabetic and 1 . 7 % of ORLISTAT patients were found to be diabetic after treatment .
14 . 7 Pediatric Clinical Studies The effects of ORLISTAT on body mass index ( BMI ) and weight loss were assessed in a 54 - week multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled study in 539 obese adolescents ( 357 receiving ORLISTAT 120 mg three times a day , 182 receiving placebo ) , aged 12 to 16 years .
All study participants had a baseline BMI that was 2 units greater than the US weighted mean for the 95 th percentile based on age and gender .
Body mass index was the primary efficacy parameter because it takes into account changes in height and body weight , which occur in growing children .
During the study , all patients were instructed to take a multivitamin containing fat - soluble vitamins at least 2 hours before or after ingestion of ORLISTAT .
Patients were also maintained on a well - balanced , reduced - calorie diet that was intended to provide 30 % of calories from fat .
In addition , all patients were placed on a behavior modification program and offered exercise counseling .
Approximately 65 % of patients in each treatment group completed the study .
Following one year of treatment , BMI decreased by an average of 0 . 55 kg / m 2 in the ORLISTAT - treated patients and increased by an average of 0 . 31 kg / m 2 in the placebo - treated patients ( p = 0 . 001 ) .
The percentages of patients achieving ≥ 5 % and ≥ 10 % reduction in BMI and body weight after 52 weeks of treatment for the intent - to - treat population are presented in Table 12 .

What is ORLISTAT ?
ORLISTAT is a prescription medicine used with a low calorie diet to increase weight loss in people with obesity .
ORLISTAT may help obese people lose weight and keep the weight off .
It is not known if ORLISTAT is safe and effective in children under 12 years old .
Who should not take ORLISTAT ?
Do not take ORLISTAT if you : • are pregnant .
A minimum weight gain , and no weight loss , is currently recommended for all pregnant women , including those who are already overweight or obese .
