( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Myelodysplastic Syndrome / Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( MDS / AML ) : MDS / AML occurred in patients exposed to RUBRACA , and some cases were fatal .
Monitor patients for hematological toxicity at baseline and monthly thereafter .
Interrupt or reduce the dose based on severity of reaction .
Discontinue if MDS / AML is confirmed .
( 2 . 3 , 5 . 1 ) • Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : RUBRACA can cause fetal harm .
Advise of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception .
( 5 . 2 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Myelodysplastic Syndrome / Acute Myeloid Leukemia Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) / Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) occur in patients treated with Rubraca , and are potentially fatal adverse reactions .
In 1594 treated patients with ovarian cancer [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] , MDS / AML occurred in 32 patients ( 2 % ) , including those in long term follow - up .
Of these , 14 occurred during treatment or during the 28 - day safety follow - up ( 0 . 9 % ) .
The duration of Rubraca treatment prior to the diagnosis of MDS / AML ranged from < 2 months to approximately 72 months .
The cases were typical of secondary MDS / cancer therapy - related AML ; in all cases , patients had received previous platinum - containing chemotherapy regimens and / or other DNA damaging agents .
In ARIEL3 , of patients with a germline and / or somatic BRCA mutation treated with Rubraca , MDS / AML occurred in 9 out of 129 ( 7 % ) patients treated with Rubraca and 4 out of 66 ( 6 % ) patients treated with placebo .
The duration of therapy with Rubraca in patients who developed secondary MDS / cancer therapy - related AML varied from 1 . 2 to 4 . 7 years .
In TRITON2 , MDS / AML was not observed in patients with mCRPC ( n = 209 ) regardless of homologous recombination deficiency ( HRD ) mutation [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Do not start Rubraca until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy ( ≤ Grade 1 ) .
Monitor complete blood counts for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment .
For prolonged hematological toxicities ( > 4 weeks ) , interrupt Rubraca or reduce dose according to Table 1 [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] and monitor blood counts weekly until recovery .
If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks or if MDS / AML is suspected , refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations , including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics .
If MDS / AML is confirmed , discontinue Rubraca .
5 . 2 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Rubraca can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies .
In an animal reproduction study , administration of rucaparib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo - fetal death at exposures that were 0 . 04 times the AUC0 - 24 h in patients receiving the recommended human dose of 600 mg twice daily .
Apprise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose of Rubraca [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
Based on findings from genetic toxicity and animal reproduction studies , advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential or who are pregnant to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following the last dose of Rubraca [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .

If concomitant administration is unavoidable between Rubraca and substrates of these enzymes where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions , decrease the substrate dosage in accordance with the approved prescribing information .
If concomitant administration with warfarin ( a CYP2C9 substrate ) cannot be avoided , consider increasing the frequency of international normalized ratio ( INR ) monitoring .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise women not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action , Rubraca can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women .
There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug - associated risk .
In an animal reproduction study , administration of rucaparib to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in embryo - fetal death at maternal exposures that were 0 . 04 times the AUC0 - 24 h in patients receiving the recommended dose of 600 mg twice daily [ see Data ] .
Apprise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In a dose range - finding embryo - fetal development study , pregnant rats received oral doses of 50 , 150 , 500 , or 1000 mg / kg / day of rucaparib during the period of organogenesis .
Post - implantation loss ( 100 % early resorptions ) was observed in all animals at doses greater than or equal to 50 mg / kg / day ( with maternal systemic exposures approximately 0 . 04 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC0 - 24 h ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of rucaparib in human milk , or on its effects on milk production or the breast - fed child .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast - fed children from Rubraca , advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with Rubraca and for 2 weeks following the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Rubraca can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Rucaparib is an inhibitor of poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) enzymes , including PARP - 1 , PARP - 2 , and PARP - 3 , which play a role in DNA repair .
In vitro studies have shown that rucaparib - induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP - DNA complexes resulting in DNA damage , apoptosis , and cancer cell death .
Increased rucaparib - induced cytotoxicity and anti - tumor activity was observed in tumor cell lines with deficiencies in BRCA1 / 2 and other DNA repair genes .
Rucaparib has been shown to decrease tumor growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer with or without deficiencies in BRCA .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure - response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of rucaparib has not fully been characterized .
Cardiac Electrophysiology A positive concentration - QTc relationship was observed in patients who were administered continuous dosages of Rubraca ranging from 40 mg once daily ( 0 . 03 times the approved recommended dosage ) to 840 mg twice daily ( 1 . 4 times the approved recommended dosage ) .
The mean ( 90 % confidence interval [ CI ] ) QTcF increase from baseline at steady state of Rubraca 600 mg twice daily was 14 . 9 msec ( 11 . 1 , 18 . 7 msec ) .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The AUC and Cmax of rucaparib demonstrated linear pharmacokinetics over a dose range from 240 mg to 840 mg twice daily ( 0 . 4 times to 1 . 4 times the approved recommended dosage ) .
The mean ( coefficient of variation [ CV ] ) steady - state rucaparib Cmax is 1 , 940 ng / mL ( 54 % ) and AUC0 - 12 h is 16 , 900 h × ng / mL ( 54 % ) at the approved recommended dosage .
The mean AUC accumulation ratio is 3 . 5 to 6 . 2 fold .
Absorption The median Tmax ( min , max ) at the steady state is 1 . 9 hours ( 0 , 5 . 98 ) at the approved recommended dosage .
The mean ( min , max ) absolute bioavailability is 36 % ( 30 % , 45 % ) .
Effect of Food Following a high - fat meal ( approximately 800 - 1000 calories , including approximately 250 calories from carbohydrates , approximately 500 - 600 calories from fat , approximately 150 calories from protein ) , the Cmax was increased by 20 % , AUC0 - 24 h was increased by 38 % , and the Tmax was delayed by 2 . 5 hours , as compared to fasted conditions [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Distribution The mean apparent volume of distribution is 2300 L ( 21 % ) .
Rucaparib is 70 % bound to human plasma proteins in vitro .
Rucaparib preferentially distributed to red blood cells with a blood - to - plasma concentration ratio of 1 . 8 .
Elimination The mean apparent total clearance at steady state is 44 . 2 L / h ( 45 % ) and the mean terminal elimination half - life is 26 ( 39 % ) hours .
Metabolism In vitro , rucaparib is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 .
In addition to CYP - based oxidation , rucaparib also undergoes N - demethylation , N - methylation , and glucuronidation .
Excretion Following a single oral dose of radiolabeled rucaparib , unchanged rucaparib accounted for 64 % of the radioactivity .
Rucaparib accounted for 45 % and 95 % of radioactivity in urine and feces , respectively .
Specific Populations Age ( 20 to 86 years ) , race ( White , Black , and Asian ) , sex , body weight ( 41 to 171 kg ) , mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr ≥ 30 mL / min ) , mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin < ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin 1 to 1 . 5 x ULN and any AST ) , and CYP2D6 or CYP1A2 genotype polymorphisms did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of rucaparib .
The effect of severe renal impairment ( CLcr 15 to 29 mL / min ) , end - stage renal disease ( CLcr < 15 mL / min ) , or severe hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 3 x ULN and any AST ) has not been studied .
Hepatic Impairment Moderate hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 to 3 x ULN and any AST ) increased rucaparib AUC by 45 % , but had no effect on Cmax compared to patients with normal hepatic function .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Model - Informed Approaches Effect of Other Drugs on Rucaparib Concomitant administration of Rubraca with a proton pump inhibitor had no clinically meaningful effect on steady - state concentrations of rucaparib .
Effect of Rucaparib on Other Drugs Concomitant administration of Rubraca with rosuvastatin ( BCRP substrate ) had no clinically meaningful effect on the concentrations of rosuvastatin .
Coadministration of Rubraca with the following substrates increased the Cmax of each coadministered substrate by ≤ 1 . 1 - fold and increased the AUC of each substrate as follows : • Caffeine ( CYP1A2 ) : by 2 . 6 - fold • Midazolam ( CYP3A4 ) : by 1 . 4 - fold • Warfarin ( CYP2C9 ) : by 1 . 5 - fold • Omeprazole ( CYP2C19 ) : by 1 . 6 - fold • Digoxin ( P - glycoprotein ) : by 1 . 2 - fold Concomitant administration of Rubraca with an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel ( CYP3A substrates ) : increased ethinylestradiol AUC by 1 . 4 - fold and levonorgestrel AUC by 1 . 6 - fold , but did not have a clinically meaningful effect on their Cmax .
In Vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) Enzymes : Rucaparib inhibited CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 and induced CYP1A2 .
UDP - glucuronosyltransferase ( UGT ) Enzymes : Rucaparib inhibited UGT1A1 .
Transporter Systems : Rucaparib is a substrate of P - gp and BCRP .
Rucaparib is not a substrate of OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OAT1 , OAT3 , or OCT2 .
Rucaparib inhibited OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OAT1 , OAT3 , MATE1 , MATE2 - K , OCT1 , OCT2 , and MRP4 .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with rucaparib .
Rucaparib was clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in cultured human lymphocytes .
The clastogenic response in mitotically - stimulated cells was anticipated based on the mechanism of action of rucaparib and indicates potential genotoxicity in humans .
Rucaparib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) test .
Fertility studies with rucaparib have not been conducted .
In 3 - month repeat - dose general toxicology studies , rucaparib had no effects on male and female reproductive organs at doses up to 100 mg / kg / day and 20 mg / kg / day in rats and dogs , respectively .
These dose levels resulted in systemic exposures of approximately 0 . 3 and 0 . 09 times the human exposure ( AUC0 - 24 h ) , respectively , at the recommended dose .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Maintenance Treatment of BRCA - mutated Recurrent Ovarian Cancer The efficacy of Rubraca was investigated in ARIEL3 ( NCT01968213 ) , a double - blind , multicenter clinical trial in which 564 patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , or primary peritoneal cancer who were in response to platinum - based chemotherapy were randomized ( 2 : 1 ) to receive Rubraca tablets 600 mg orally twice daily ( n = 375 ) or placebo ( n = 189 ) .
Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
All patients had achieved a response ( complete or partial ) to their most recent platinum - based chemotherapy .
Randomization was stratified by best response to last platinum ( complete or partial ) , time to progression following the penultimate platinum therapy ( 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months ) , and tumor biomarker status .
Tumor tissue samples were tested using a clinical trial assay ( CTA ) ( N = 564 ) and an investigational Foundation Medicine tissue test ( n = 518 ) .
Of the samples evaluated with both tests , tumor BRCA ( tBRCA ) mutant status was confirmed for 99 % ( 177 / 178 ) of tBRCA - positive patients determined by the CTA .
Blood samples for 94 % ( 186 / 196 ) of the tBRCA patients were evaluated using a central blood germline BRCA test .
Based on these results , 70 % ( 130 / 186 ) of the tBRCA patients had a germline BRCA mutation and 30 % ( 56 / 186 ) had a somatic BRCA mutation .
The efficacy results are based on the tBRCA ( germline or somatic ) subgroup .
The major efficacy outcome was investigator - assessed progression - free survival ( PFS ) evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) , version 1 . 1 ( v1 . 1 ) .
Overall survival ( OS ) was an additional outcome measure .
Of the 564 enrolled patients , 196 patients ( 35 % ) had a tBRCA mutation .
Among the patients who had a tBRCA mutation , the median age was 58 years ( range : 42 to 81 ) for patients receiving Rubraca and 59 years ( range : 36 to 84 ) for those on placebo ; the majority were White ( 84 % ) ; and 100 % had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 .
All patients had received at least two prior platinum - based chemotherapies ( range : 2 to 5 ) .
A total of 33 % of patients were in complete response ( CR ) to their most recent therapy .
The progression - free interval to penultimate platinum was 6 - 12 months in 41 % of patients and > 12 months in 59 % .
Prior bevacizumab therapy was reported for 22 % of patients who received Rubraca and 17 % of patients who received placebo .
Measurable disease was present at baseline in 32 % of patients .
ARIEL3 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients randomized to Rubraca as compared with placebo in patients who had a tBRCA mutation .
Results from a blinded independent radiology review were consistent .
Efficacy results for patients with a tBRCA mutation are summarized in Table 6 and Figure 1 .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 BRCA - mutated Metastatic Castration - Resistant Prostate Cancer The efficacy of Rubraca was investigated in TRITON2 ( NCT02952534 ) , an ongoing multi - center , single arm clinical trial in patients with BRCA - mutated mCRPC who had been treated with androgen receptor - directed therapy and taxane - based chemotherapy .
There were 115 patients with either germline or somatic BRCA mutations enrolled in TRITON2 , of whom 62 patients had measurable disease at baseline by independent radiology review ( IRR ) .
Patients received Rubraca 600 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Patients also received concomitant GnRH analog or had prior bilateral orchiectomy .
Objective response rate ( ORR ) and duration of response ( DOR ) were assessed in patients with measurable disease by blinded IRR and by the investigator according to modified RECIST v1 . 1 / Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 ( PCWG3 ) criteria .
For the 62 patients with measurable disease at baseline , the median age was 73 years ( range 52 to 88 ) ; the majority were White ( 73 % ) and 10 % were Black ; and 98 % of patients had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 .
All patients had received at least one prior androgen receptor - directed therapy , 34 % had received 2 prior androgen receptor - directed therapies and 2 % had received 3 prior androgen receptor - directed therapies , and all patients also received prior taxane chemotherapy .
Eighteen percent of patients had lung and 21 % had liver metastases at baseline .
Twenty - four percent had metastases to lymph nodes alone .
Forty percent had 10 or more bone lesions at baseline .
All 62 patients had a deleterious somatic or germline BRCA mutation detected from either central plasma ( 26 % ) , central tissue ( 32 % ) , or local ( 42 % ) testing .
Of the 62 patients , 66 % had a somatic BRCA mutation , 34 % had a germline BRCA mutation , 85 % had a BRCA2 mutation , and 15 % had a BRCA1 mutation .
The major efficacy outcomes of the study were confirmed ORR by IRR using modified RECIST v1 . 1 / PCWG3 criteria and DOR .
Efficacy results of TRITON2 are provided in Table 7 .
The ORR by IRR was similar in patients with germline versus somatic BRCA mutation .
