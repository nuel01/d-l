( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • • Patients with known hypersensitivity to azithromycin , erythromycin , any macrolide , or ketolide antibacterial drug .
( 4 . 1 ) • • Patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice / hepatic dysfunction associated with prior use of azithromycin .
( 4 . 2 ) 4 . 1 Hypersensitivity Azithromycin for Injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to azithromycin , erythromycin , any macrolide or ketolide drugs .
4 . 2 Hepatic Dysfunction Azithromycin for Injection is contraindicated in patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice / hepatic dysfunction associated with prior use of azithromycin .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Serious ( including fatal ) allergic and skin reactions .
Discontinue azithromycin and initiate appropriate therapy if reaction occurs .
( 5 . 1 ) • Hepatotoxicity : Severe and sometimes fatal , hepatoxicity has been reported .
Discontinue Azithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur .
( 5 . 2 ) • Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis ( IHPS ) : Following the use of azithromycin in neonates ( treatment up to 42 days of life ) , IHPS has been reported .
Direct parents and caregivers to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs .
( 5 . 3 ) • Prolongation of QT interval and cases of torsades de pointes have been reported .
This risk which can be fatal should be considered in patients with certain cardiovascular disorders including known QT prolongation or history torsades de pointes , those with proarrhythmic conditions and with other drugs that prolong the QT interval .
( 5 . 4 ) • Cardiovascular Death : Some observational studies have shown an approximately two - fold increased short - term potential risk of acute cardiovascular death in adults exposed to azithromycin relative to other antibacterial drugs , including amoxicillin .
Consider balancing this potential risk with treatment benefits when prescribing azithromycin .
( 5 . 5 ) • Clostridioides difficile - Associated Diarrhea : Evaluate patients if diarrhea occurs .
( 5 . 6 ) • Azithromycin may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis .
( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Serious allergic reactions , including angioedema , anaphylaxis , and dermatologic reactions including Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis ( AGEP ) , Stevens - Johnson Syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients on azithromycin therapy [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 1 ) ] .
Fatalities have been reported .
Cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms ( DRESS ) have also been reported .
Despite initially successful symptomatic treatment of the allergic symptoms , when symptomatic therapy was discontinued , the allergic symptoms recurred soon thereafter in some patients without further azithromycin exposure .
These patients required prolonged periods of observation and symptomatic treatment .
The relationship of these episodes to the long tissue half - life of azithromycin and subsequent prolonged exposure to antigen is unknown at present .
If an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted .
Physicians should be aware that the allergic symptoms may reappear after symptomatic therapy has been discontinued .
5 . 2 Hepatotoxicity Abnormal liver function , hepatitis , cholestatic jaundice , hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure have been reported , some of which have resulted in death .
Discontinue azithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur .
5 . 3 Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis ( IHPS ) Following the use of azithromycin in neonates ( treatment up to 42 days of life ) , IHPS has been reported .
Direct parents and caregivers to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs .
5 . 4 QT Prolongation Prolonged cardiac repolarization and QT interval , imparting a risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia and torsades de pointes , have been seen with treatment with macrolides , including azithromycin .
Cases of torsades de pointes have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving azithromycin .
Providers should consider the risk of QT prolongation , which can be fatal when weighing the risks and benefits of azithromycin for at - risk groups including : • • patients with known prolongation of the QT interval , a history of torsades de pointes , congenital long QT syndrome , bradyarrhythmias or uncompensated heart failure • • patients on drugs known to prolong the QT interval • • patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia , clinically significant bradycardia and in patients receiving Class IA ( quinidine , procainamide ) or Class III ( dofetilide , amiodarone , sotalol ) antiarrhythmic agents .
Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug - associated effects on the QT interval .
5 . 5 Cardiovascular Death Some observational studies have shown an approximately two - fold increased short - term potential risk of acute cardiovascular death in adults exposed to azithromycin relative to other antibacterial drugs , including amoxicillin .
The five - day cardiovascular mortality observed in these studies ranged from 20 to 400 per million azithromycin treatment courses .
This potential risk was noted to be greater during the first five days of azithromycin use and does not appear to be limited to those patients with preexisting cardiovascular diseases .
The data in these observational studies are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between acute cardiovascular death and azithromycin use .
Consider balancing this potential risk with treatment benefits when prescribing azithromycin .
5 . 6 Clostridioides difficile - Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including Azithromycin for Injection and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibacterial use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibacterial treatment of C . difficile and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
5 . 7 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbations of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of myasthenic syndrome have been reported in patients receiving azithromycin therapy .
5 . 8 Infusion Site Reactions Azithromycin for Injection should be reconstituted and diluted as directed and administered as an intravenous infusion over not less than 60 minutes [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Local IV site reactions have been reported with the intravenous administration of azithromycin .
The incidence and severity of these reactions were the same when 500 mg azithromycin was given over 1 hour ( 2 mg / mL as 250 mL infusion ) or over 3 hours ( 1 mg / mL as 500 mL infusion ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
All volunteers who received infusate concentrations above 2 mg / mL experienced local IV site reactions and , therefore , higher concentrations should be avoided .
5 . 9 Development of Drug - Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Azithromycin for Injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling : • Hypersensitivity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Hepatotoxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis ( IHPS ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • QT Prolongation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Cardiovascular Death [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Clostridioides difficile - Associated Diarrhea ( CDAD ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] Most common adverse reactions are nausea ( 4 % ) , diarrhea ( 4 % ) , abdominal pain ( 3 % ) , or vomiting ( 1 % ) .
( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Hospira , Inc . at 1 - 800 - 441 - 4100 , or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In clinical trials of intravenous azithromycin for community - acquired pneumonia , in which 2 to 5 IV doses were given , the reported adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity and were reversible upon discontinuation of the drug .
The majority of patients in these trials had one or more co - morbid diseases and were receiving concomitant medications .
Approximately 1 . 2 % of the patients discontinued intravenous Azithromycin for Injection therapy , and a total of 2 . 4 % discontinued azithromycin therapy by either the intravenous or oral route because of clinical or laboratory side effects .
In clinical trials conducted in patients with pelvic inflammatory disease , in which 1 to 2 IV doses were given , 2 % of women who received monotherapy with azithromycin and 4 % who received azithromycin plus metronidazole discontinued therapy due to clinical side effects .
Clinical adverse reactions leading to discontinuations from these studies were gastrointestinal ( abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ) and rashes ; laboratory side effects leading to discontinuation were increases in transaminase levels and / or alkaline phosphatase levels .
Overall , the most common adverse reactions associated with treatment in adult patients who received IV / Oral Azithromycin in studies of community - acquired pneumonia were related to the gastrointestinal system with diarrhea / loose stools ( 4 . 3 % ) , nausea ( 3 . 9 % ) , abdominal pain ( 2 . 7 % ) and vomiting ( 1 . 4 % ) being the most frequently reported .
Approximately 12 % of patients experienced a side effect related to the intravenous infusion ; most common were pain at the injection site ( 6 . 5 % ) and local inflammation ( 3 . 1 % ) .
The most common adverse reactions associated with treatment in adult women who received IV / Oral Azithromycin in trials of pelvic inflammatory disease were related to the gastrointestinal system .
Diarrhea ( 8 . 5 % ) and nausea ( 6 . 6 % ) were most commonly reported , followed by vaginitis ( 2 . 8 % ) , abdominal pain ( 1 . 9 % ) , anorexia ( 1 . 9 % ) , rash and pruritus ( 1 . 9 % ) .
When azithromycin was co - administered with metronidazole in these trials , a higher proportion of women experienced adverse reactions of nausea ( 10 . 3 % ) , abdominal pain ( 3 . 7 % ) , vomiting ( 2 . 8 % ) , infusion site reaction , stomatitis , dizziness , or dyspnea ( all at 1 . 9 % ) .
Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of 1 % or less included the following : Gastrointestinal : Dyspepsia , flatulence , mucositis , oral moniliasis and gastritis .
Nervous system : Headache , somnolence .
Allergic : Bronchospasm .
Special senses : Taste perversion .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of azithromycin .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Adverse reactions reported with azithromycin during the postmarketing period in adult and / or pediatric patients for which a causal relationship may not be established include : Allergic : Arthralgia , edema , urticaria and angioedema .
Cardiovascular : Arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia and hypotension .
There have been reports of QT prolongation , torsades de pointes , and cardiovascular death .
Gastrointestinal : Anorexia , constipation , dyspepsia , flatulence , vomiting / diarrhea , pseudomembranous colitis , pancreatitis , oral candidiasis , pyloric stenosis , and reports of tongue discoloration .
General : Asthenia , paresthesia , fatigue , malaise and anaphylaxis ( including fatalities ) .
Genitourinary : Interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure and vaginitis .
Hematopoietic : Thrombocytopenia .
Liver / biliary : Abnormal liver function , hepatitis , cholestatic jaundice , hepatic necrosis , and hepatic failure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Nervous system : Convulsions , dizziness / vertigo , headache , somnolence , hyperactivity , nervousness , agitation and syncope .
Psychiatric : Aggressive reaction and anxiety .
Skin / appendages : Pruritus , serious skin reactions including , erythema multiforme , AGEP , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis , and DRESS .
Special senses : Hearing disturbances including hearing loss , deafness and / or tinnitus and reports of taste / smell perversion and / or loss .
6 . 3 Laboratory Abnormalities Significant abnormalities ( irrespective of drug relationship ) occurring during the clinical trials were reported as follows : • • elevated ALT ( SGPT ) , AST ( SGOT ) , creatinine ( 4 to 6 % ) • • elevated LDH , bilirubin ( 1 to 3 % ) • • leukopenia , neutropenia , decreased platelet count , and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase ( less than 1 % ) When follow - up was provided , changes in laboratory tests appeared to be reversible .
In multiple - dose clinical trials involving more than 750 patients treated with azithromycin ( IV / Oral ) , less than 2 % of patients discontinued azithromycin therapy because of treatment - related liver enzyme abnormalities .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • • Nelfinavir : Close monitoring for known adverse reactions of azithromycin , such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment , is warranted .
( 7 . 1 ) • • Warfarin : Use with azithromycin may increase coagulation times ; monitor prothrombin time .
( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Nelfinavir Co - administration of nelfinavir at steady - state with a single oral dose of azithromycin resulted in increased azithromycin serum concentrations .
Although a dose adjustment of azithromycin is not recommended when administered in combination with nelfinavir , close monitoring for known adverse reactions of azithromycin , such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment , is warranted [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
7 . 2 Warfarin Spontaneous postmarketing reports suggest that concomitant administration of azithromycin may potentiate the effects of oral anticoagulants such as warfarin , although the prothrombin time was not affected in the dedicated drug interaction study with azithromycin and warfarin .
Prothrombin times should be carefully monitored while patients are receiving azithromycin and oral anticoagulants concomitantly .
7 . 3 Potential Drug - Drug Interaction with Macrolides Interactions with digoxin , colchicine or phenytoin have not been reported in clinical trials with azithromycin .
No specific drug interaction studies have been performed to evaluate potential drug - drug interaction .
However , drug interactions have been observed with other macrolide products .
Until further data are developed regarding drug interactions when digoxin , colchicine or phenytoin are used with azithromycin careful monitoring of patients is advised .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Pediatric use : Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of patients under 16 years of age have not been established .
( 8 . 4 ) • • Geriatric use : Elderly patients may be more susceptible to development of torsades de pointes arrhythmias .
( 8 . 5 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature and postmarketing experience over several decades with azithromycin use in pregnant women have not identified any drug - associated risks for major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ) .
Developmental toxicity studies with azithromycin in rats , mice , and rabbits showed no drug - induced fetal malformations at doses up to 4 , 2 , and 2 times , respectively , an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area .
Decreased viability and delayed development were observed in the offspring of pregnant rats administered azithromycin from day 6 of pregnancy through weaning at a dose equivalent to 4 times an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data Available data from published observational studies , case series and case reports over several decades do not suggest an increased risk for major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes with azithromycin use in pregnant women .
Limitations of these data include the lack of randomization and inability to control for confounders such as underlying maternal disease and maternal use of concomitant medications .
Animal Data Reproductive and developmental toxicology studies have not been conducted using IV administration of azithromycin to animals .
Azithromycin administered during the period of organogenesis did not cause fetal malformations in rats and mice at oral doses up to 200 mg / kg / day ( moderately maternally toxic ) .
Based on body surface area , this dose is approximately 4 ( rats ) and 2 ( mice ) times an adult human daily dose of 500 mg .
In rabbits administered azithromycin at oral doses of 10 , 20 and 40 mg / kg / day during organogenesis , reduced maternal body weight and food consumption were observed in all groups ; no evidence of fetotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed at these doses , the highest of which is estimated to be 2 times an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area .
In a pre - and postnatal development study , azithromycin was administered orally to pregnant rats from day 6 of pregnancy until weaning at doses of 50 or 200 mg / kg / day .
Maternal toxicity ( reduced food consumption and body weight gain ; increased stress at parturition ) was observed at the higher dose .
Effects in the offspring were noted at 200 mg / kg / day during the postnatal development period ( decreased viability , delayed developmental landmarks ) .
These effects were not observed in a pre - and postnatal rat study when up to 200 mg / kg / day of azithromycin was given orally beginning on day 15 of pregnancy until weaning .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Azithromycin is present in human milk ( see Data ) .
Non - serious adverse reactions have been reported in breastfed infants after maternal administration of azithromycin ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
There are no available data on the effects of azithromycin on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for azithromycin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azithromycin or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations Advise women to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea , vomiting , or rash .
Data Azithromycin breastmilk concentrations were measured in 20 women after receiving a single 2 g oral dose of azithromycin during labor .
Breastmilk samples collected on days 3 and 6 postpartum as well as 2 and 4 weeks postpartum revealed the presence of azithromycin in breastmilk up to 4 weeks after dosing .
In another study , a single dose of azithromycin 500 mg was administered intravenously to 8 women prior to incision for cesarean section .
Breastmilk ( colostrum ) samples obtained between 12 and 48 hours after dosing revealed that azithromycin persisted in breastmilk up to 48 hours .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of azithromycin for injection in children or adolescents under 16 years have not been established .
In controlled clinical studies , azithromycin has been administered to pediatric patients ( age 6 months to 16 years ) by the oral route .
For information regarding the use of azithromycin for oral suspension in the treatment of pediatric patients , [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] of the prescribing information for Azithromycin for oral suspension 100 mg / 5 mL and 200 mg / 5 mL bottles .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Pharmacokinetic studies with intravenous azithromycin have not been performed in older volunteers .
Pharmacokinetics of azithromycin following oral administration in older volunteers ( 65 – 85 years old ) were similar to those in younger volunteers ( 18 – 40 years old ) for the 5 - day therapeutic regimen .
In multiple - dose clinical trials of intravenous azithromycin in the treatment of community - acquired pneumonia , 45 % of patients ( 188 / 414 ) were at least 65 years of age and 22 % of patients ( 91 / 414 ) were at least 75 years of age .
No overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects in terms of adverse reactions , laboratory abnormalities and discontinuations .
Similar decreases in clinical response were noted in azithromycin - and comparator - treated patients with increasing age .
Azithromycin for Injection contains 114 mg ( 4 . 96 mEq ) of sodium per vial .
At the usual recommended doses , patients would receive 114 mg ( 4 . 96 mEq ) of sodium .
The geriatric population may respond with a blunted natriuresis to salt loading .
The total sodium content from dietary and non - dietary sources may be clinically important with regard to such diseases as congestive heart failure .
Elderly patients may be more susceptible to development of torsades de pointes arrhythmia than younger patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Adverse reactions experienced in higher than recommended doses were similar to those seen at normal doses particularly nausea , diarrhea and vomiting .
In the event of overdosage , general symptomatic and supportive measures are indicated as required .
11 DESCRIPTION Azithromycin for Injection , USP contains the active ingredient azithromycin , an azalide , a subclass of macrolide antibiotics , for intravenous injection .
Azithromycin has the chemical name ( 2 R , 3 S , 4 R , 5 R , 8 R , 10 R , 11 R , 12 S , 13 S , 14 R ) - 13 - [ ( 2 , 6 - dideoxy - 3 - C - methyl - 3 - O - methyl - α - L - ribo - hexopyranosyl ) oxy ] - 2 - ethyl - 3 , 4 , 10 - trihydroxy - 3 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 - hepta - methyl - 11 - [ [ 3 , 4 , 6 - trideoxy - 3 - ( dimethylamino ) - β - D - xylo - hexopyranosyl ] oxy ] - 1 - oxa - 6 - azacyclopentadecan - 15 - one .
Azithromycin is derived from erythromycin ; however , it differs chemically from erythromycin in that a methyl - substituted nitrogen atom is incorporated into the lactone ring .
Its molecular formula is C38H72N2O12 , and its molecular weight is 749 .
Azithromycin has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Azithromycin , as the monohydrate , is a white crystalline powder with a molecular formula of C38H72N2O12 ∙ H2O and a molecular weight of 767 .
Azithromycin for Injection , USP consists of azithromycin monohydrate and the following inactive ingredients : anhydrous citric acid and sodium hydroxide .
Sodium hydroxide is added to adjust the pH . Azithromycin for Injection , USP is supplied as white to off - white lyophilized powder in a single - dose ADD - Vantage ® vial for intravenous administration only after reconstitution , according to directions in the Dosage and Administration section .
Each ADD - Vantage ® vial contains azithromycin monohydrate equivalent to 500 mg azithromycin , 392 mg anhydrous citric acid and sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Based on animal models of infection , the antibacterial activity of azithromycin appears to correlate with the ratio of area under the concentration - time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration ( AUC / MIC ) for certain pathogens ( S . pneumoniae and S . aureus ) .
The principal pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic parameter best associated with clinical and microbiological cure has not been elucidated in clinical trials with azithromycin .
Cardiac Electrophysiology QTc interval prolongation was studied in a randomized , placebo - controlled parallel trial in 116 healthy subjects who received either chloroquine ( 1 , 000 mg ) alone or in combination with oral azithromycin ( 500 mg , 1 , 000 mg , and 1 , 500 mg once daily ) .
Co - administration of azithromycin increased the QTc interval in a dose - and concentration - dependent manner .
In comparison to chloroquine alone , the maximum mean ( 95 % upper confidence bound ) increases in QTcF were 5 ( 10 ) ms , 7 ( 12 ) ms and 9 ( 14 ) ms with the co - administration of 500 mg , 1 , 000 mg and 1 , 500 mg azithromycin , respectively .
Since the mean Cmax of azithromycin following a 500 mg IV dose given over 1 hour is higher than the mean Cmax of azithromycin following the administration of a 1 , 500 mg oral dose , it is possible that QTc may be prolonged to a greater extent with IV azithromycin at close proximity to a one hour infusion of 500 mg .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In patients hospitalized with community - acquired pneumonia receiving single daily one - hour intravenous infusions for 2 to 5 days of 500 - mg azithromycin at a concentration of 2 mg / mL , the mean Cmax ± S . D . achieved was 3 . 63 ± 1 . 60 mcg / mL , while the 24 - hour trough level was 0 . 20 ± 0 . 15 mcg / mL and the AUC24 was 9 . 60 ± 4 . 80 mcg ∙ h / mL .
The mean Cmax , 24 - hour trough and AUC24 values were 1 . 14 ± 0 . 14 mcg / mL , 0 . 18 ± 0 . 02 mcg / mL and 8 . 03 ± 0 . 86 mcg ∙ h / mL , respectively , in normal volunteers receiving a 3 - hour intravenous infusion of 500 mg azithromycin at a concentration of 1 mg / mL .
Similar pharmacokinetic values were obtained in patients hospitalized with community - acquired pneumonia who received the same 3 - hour dosage regimen for 2 – 5 days .
a 500 mg ( 2 mg / mL ) for 2 - 5 days in community - acquired pneumonia patients .
b 500 mg ( 1 mg / mL ) for 5 days in healthy subjects .

Following single - oral doses of 500 mg azithromycin ( two 250 mg capsules ) to 12 healthy volunteers , Cmax , trough level and AUC24 were reported to be 0 . 41 mcg / mL , 0 . 05 mcg / mL and 2 . 6 mcg ∙ h / mL , respectively .
These oral values are approximately 38 % , 83 % and 52 % of the values observed following a single 500 - mg I . V . 3 - hour infusion ( Cmax : 1 . 08 mcg / mL , trough : 0 . 06 mcg / mL and AUC24 : 5 mcg ∙ h / mL ) .
Thus , plasma concentrations are higher following the intravenous regimen throughout the 24 - hour interval .
Distribution The serum protein binding of azithromycin is variable in the concentration range approximating human exposure , decreasing from 51 % at 0 . 02 mcg / mL to 7 % at 2 mcg / mL .
Tissue concentrations have not been obtained following intravenous infusions of azithromycin , but following oral administration in humans azithromycin has been shown to penetrate into tissues , including skin , lung , tonsil and cervix .
Tissue levels were determined following a single oral dose of 500 - mg azithromycin in 7 gynecological patients .
Approximately 17 hours after dosing , azithromycin concentrations were 2 . 7 mcg / g in ovarian tissue , 3 . 5 mcg / g in uterine tissue and 3 . 3 mcg / g in salpinx .
Following a regimen of 500 mg on the first day followed by 250 mg daily for 4 days , concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid were less than 0 . 01 mcg / mL in the presence of non - inflamed meninges .
Metabolism In vitro and in vivo studies to assess the metabolism of azithromycin have not been performed .
Elimination Plasma concentrations of azithromycin following single 500 - mg oral and IV doses declined in a polyphasic pattern with a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL / min and terminal elimination half - life of 68 hours .
The prolonged terminal half - life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues .
In a multiple - dose study in 12 normal volunteers utilizing a 500 - mg ( 1 mg / mL ) one - hour intravenous - dosage regimen for five days , the amount of administered azithromycin dose excreted in urine in 24 hours was about 11 % after the 1 st dose and 14 % after the 5 th dose .
These values are greater than the reported 6 % excreted unchanged in urine after oral administration of azithromycin .
Biliary excretion is a major route of elimination for unchanged drug , following oral administration .
Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment Azithromycin pharmacokinetics were investigated in 42 adults ( 21 to 85 years of age ) with varying degrees of renal impairment .
Following the oral administration of a single 1 , 000 - mg dose of azithromycin , mean Cmax and AUC0 – 120 increased by 5 . 1 % and 4 . 2 % , respectively in subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment ( GFR 10 to 80 mL / min ) compared to subjects with normal renal function ( GFR > 80 mL / min ) .
The mean Cmax and AUC0 – 120 increased 61 % and 35 % , respectively in subjects with severe renal impairment ( GFR < 10 mL / min ) compared to subjects with normal renal function ( GFR > 80 mL / min ) .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of azithromycin in subjects with hepatic impairment has not been established .
Male and Female Patients There are no significant differences in the disposition of azithromycin between male and female subjects .
No dosage adjustment is recommended based on gender .
Geriatric Patients Pharmacokinetic studies with intravenous azithromycin have not been performed in older volunteers .
Pharmacokinetics of azithromycin following oral administration in older volunteers ( 65 – 85 years old ) were similar to those in younger volunteers ( 18 – 40 years old ) for the 5 - day therapeutic regimen [ see Geriatric Use ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Pediatric Patients Pharmacokinetic studies with intravenous azithromycin have not been performed in children .
Drug Interaction Studies Drug interaction studies were performed with oral azithromycin and other drugs likely to be co - administered .
The effects of co - administration of azithromycin on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs are shown in Table 1 and the effects of other drugs on the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin are shown in Table 2 .
Co - administration of azithromycin at therapeutic doses had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of the drugs listed in Table 1 .
No dosage adjustment of drugs listed in Table 1 is recommended when co - administered with azithromycin .
Co - administration of azithromycin with efavirenz or fluconazole had a modest effect on the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin .
Nelfinavir significantly increased the Cmax and AUC of azithromycin .
No dosage adjustment of azithromycin is recommended when administered with drugs listed in Table 2 [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .

Resistance Azithromycin demonstrates cross - resistance with erythromycin .
The most frequently encountered mechanism of resistance to azithromycin is modification of the 23 S rRNA target , most often by methylation .
Ribosomal modifications can determine cross resistance to other macrolides , lincosamides and streptogramin B ( MLSB phenotype ) .
Antimicrobial Activity Azithromycin has been shown to be active against the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections .
[ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] Gram - positive Bacteria Other Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus Chlamydophila pneumoniae Streptococcus pneumoniae Chlamydia trachomatis Mycoplasma hominis Gram - negative Bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Neisseria gonorrhoeae Legionella pneumophila The following in vitro data are available , but their clinical significance is unknown .
At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for azithromycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group .
However , the efficacy of azithromycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well - controlled clinical trials .
Aerobic Gram - Positive Bacteria Streptococci ( Groups C , F , G ) Viridans group streptococci Anaerobic Bacteria Peptostreptococcus species Prevotella bivia Other Bacteria Ureaplasma urealyticum Gram - Negative Bacteria Bordetella pertussis Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug , please see : https : / / www . fda . gov / STIC .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential .
Azithromycin has shown no mutagenic potential in standard laboratory tests : mouse lymphoma assay , human lymphocyte clastogenic assay , and mouse bone marrow clastogenic assay .
In fertility studies conducted in male and female rats , oral administration of azithromycin for 64 to 66 days ( males ) or 15 days ( females ) prior to and during cohabitation resulted in decreased pregnancy rate at 20 and 30 mg / kg / day when both males and females were treated with azithromycin .
This minimal effect on pregnancy rate ( approximately 12 % reduction compared to concurrent controls ) did not become more pronounced when the dose was increased from 20 to 30 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 4 to 0 . 6 times the adult daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area ) and it was not observed when only one animal in the mated pair was treated .
There were no effects on any other reproductive parameters and there were no effects on fertility at 10 mg / kg / day .
The relevance of these findings to patients being treated with azithromycin at the doses and durations recommended in the prescribing information is uncertain .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Phospholipidosis ( intracellular phospholipid accumulation ) has been observed in some tissues of mice , rats and dogs given multiple oral doses of azithromycin .
It has been demonstrated in numerous organ systems ( e . g . , eye , dorsal root ganglia , liver , gallbladder , kidney , spleen and / or pancreas ) in dogs and rats treated with azithromycin at doses which , expressed on the basis of body surface area , are similar to or less than the highest recommended adult human dose .
This effect has been shown to be reversible after cessation of azithromycin treatment .
Based on the pharmacokinetic data , phospholipidosis has been seen in the rat ( 50 mg / kg / day dose ) at the observed maximal plasma concentration of 1 . 3 mcg / mL ( 1 . 6 times the observed Cmax of 0 . 821 mcg / mL at the adult dose of 2 g . ) Similarly , it has been shown in the dog ( 10 mg / kg / day dose ) at the observed maximal serum concentration of 1 mcg / mL ( 1 . 2 times the observed Cmax of 0 . 821 mcg / mL at the adult dose of 2 g ) .
Phospholipidosis was also observed in neonatal rats dosed for 18 days at 30 mg / kg / day , which is less than the pediatric dose of 60 mg / kg based on body surface area .
It was not observed in neonatal rats treated for 10 days at 40 mg / kg / day with mean maximal serum concentrations of 1 . 86 mcg / mL , approximately 1 . 5 times the Cmax of 1 . 27 mcg / mL at the pediatric dose .
Phospholipidosis has been observed in neonatal dogs ( 10 mg / kg / day ) at maximum mean whole blood concentrations of 3 . 54 mcg / mL , approximately 3 times the pediatric dose Cmax .
The significance of the findings for animals and for humans is unknown .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Community - Acquired Pneumonia In a controlled trial of community - acquired pneumonia performed in the U . S . , azithromycin ( 500 mg as a single daily dose by the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days , followed by 500 mg / day by the oral route to complete 7 to 10 days therapy ) was compared to cefuroxime ( 2 , 250 mg / day in three divided doses by the intravenous route for 2 to 5 days followed by 1 , 000 mg / day in two divided doses by the oral route to complete 7 to 10 days therapy ) , with or without erythromycin .
