11 DESCRIPTION Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 . 2 % / 5 % is a fixed combination product with two active ingredients in a white , opaque , aqueous gel formulation .
Clindamycin phosphate is a water soluble ester of the semi - synthetic antibiotic produced by a 7 ( S ) - chloro - substitution of the 7 ( R ) - hydroxyl group of the parent antibiotic lincomycin .
Clindamycin phosphate is C18H34ClN2O8PS .
The structural formula for clindamycin phosphate is represented below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Clindamycin phosphate has a molecular weight of 504 . 97 and its chemical name is methyl 7 - chloro - 6 , 7 , 8 - trideoxy - 6 - ( 1 - methyl - trans - 4 - propyl - L - 2 - pyrrolidinecarboxamido ) - 1 - thio - L - threo - α - D - galacto - octopyranoside 2 - ( dihydrogen phosphate ) .
Benzoyl peroxide is C14H10O4 .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Benzoyl peroxide has a molecular weight of 242 . 23 .
Each gram of Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 . 2 % / 5 % contains 10 mg ( 1 % ) clindamycin , as clindamycin phosphate , and 50 mg ( 5 % ) benzoyl peroxide in a base consisting of carbomer homopolymer ( type B ) , hydrochloric acid , methylparaben , dimethicone , propylparaben , purified water and sodium hydroxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Clindamycin : Clindamycin is a lincosamide antibacterial [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
Benzoyl Peroxide : Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bacteriocidal and keratolytic effects , but the precise mechanism of action is unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics A comparative trial of the pharmacokinetics of clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel , 1 . 2 % / 5 % and 1 % clindamycin solution alone in 78 subjects indicated that mean plasma clindamycin levels during the 4 - week dosing period were less than 0 . 5 ng / mL for both treatment groups .
Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid .
Less than 2 % of the dose enters systemic circulation as benzoic acid .
12 . 4 Microbiology Clindamycin binds to the 50 S ribosomal subunits of susceptible bacteria and prevents elongation of peptide chains by interfering with peptidyl transfer , thereby suppressing protein synthesis .
In Vivo Activity : No microbiology studies were conducted in the clinical trials with this product .
In Vitro Activity : The clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide components individually have been shown to have in vitro activity against Propionibacterium acnes , an organism which has been associated with acne vulgaris ; however , the clinical significance of this in vitro activity is not known .
Drug Resistance : There are reports of an increase of P . acnes resistance to clindamycin in the treatment of acne .
In patients with P . acnes resistant to clindamycin , the clindamycin component may provide no additional benefit beyond benzoyl peroxide alone .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be a tumor promoter and progression agent in a number of animal studies .
Benzoyl peroxide in acetone at doses of 5 and 10 mg administered twice per week induced squamous cell skin tumors in transgenic TgAC mice in a study using 20 weeks of topical treatment .
The clinical significance of this is unknown .
In a 2 - year dermal carcinogenicity study in mice , treatment with clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel , 1 . 2 % / 5 % at doses up to 8 , 000 mg per kg per day ( 16 times the highest recommended adult human dose of 2 . 5 g clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel , 1 . 2 % / 5 % , based on mg per m2 ) did not cause an increase in skin tumors .
However , topical treatment with another formulation containing 1 % clindamycin and 5 % benzoyl peroxide at doses of 100 , 500 , or 2 , 000 mg per kg per day caused a dose - dependent increase in the incidence of keratoacanthoma at the treated skin site of male rats in a 2 - year dermal carcinogenicity study in rats .
In a 52 - week photocarcinogenicity study in hairless mice ( 40 weeks of treatment followed by 12 weeks of observation ) , the median time to onset of skin tumor formation decreased and the number of tumors per mouse increased relative to controls following chronic concurrent topical treatment with clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel , 1 . 2 % / 5 % and exposure to ultraviolet radiation .
Genotoxicity studies were not conducted with clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel , 1 . 2 % / 5 % .
Clindamycin phosphate was not genotoxic in Salmonella typhimurium or in a rat micronucleus test .
Benzoyl peroxide has been found to cause DNA strand breaks in a variety of mammalian cell types , to be mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium tests by some but not all investigators , and to cause sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells .
Studies have not been performed with clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel , 1 . 2 % / 5 % or benzoyl peroxide to evaluate the effect on fertility .
Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg per kg per day of clindamycin ( approximately 120 times the amount of clindamycin in the highest recommended adult human dose of 2 . 5 g clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel , 1 . 2 % / 5 % , based on mg per m2 ) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES In five randomized , double - blind clinical trials of 1 , 319 subjects , 397 used clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel , 1 . 2 % / 5 % , 396 used benzoyl peroxide , 349 used clindamycin , and 177 used vehicle .
Subjects were instructed to wash the face , wait 10 to 20 minutes , and then apply medication to the entire face , once daily in the evening before retiring .
Clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel , 1 . 2 % / 5 % applied once daily for 11 weeks was significantly more effective than vehicle , benzoyl peroxide , and clindamycin in the treatment of inflammatory lesions of moderate to moderately severe facial acne vulgaris in three of the five trials ( Trials 1 , 2 , and 5 ) .
Subjects were evaluated and acne lesions counted at each clinical visit at Weeks 2 , 5 , 8 , 11 .
The primary efficacy measures were the lesion counts and the investigator ’ s global assessment evaluated at Week 11 .
Percent reductions in inflammatory lesion counts after treatment for 11 weeks in these 5 trials are shown in Table 2 .
Table 2 .
Mean Percent Reduction In Inflammatory Lesion Counts Treatment Trial 1 ( n = 120 ) Trial 2 ( n = 273 ) Trial 3 ( n = 280 ) Trial 4 ( n = 288 ) Trial 5 ( n = 358 ) Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 . 2 % / 5 % 65 % 56 % 42 % 57 % 52 % Benzoyl Peroxide 36 % 37 % 32 % 57 % 41 % Clindamycin 34 % 30 % 38 % 49 % 33 % Vehicle 19 % - 0 . 4 % 29 % -- 29 % The group treated with clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel , 1 . 2 % / 5 % showed greater overall improvement in the investigator ’ s global assessment than the benzoyl peroxide , clindamycin , and vehicle groups in three of the five trials ( Trials 1 , 2 , and 5 ) .
Clinical trials have not adequately demonstrated the effectiveness of clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel , 1 . 2 % / 5 % versus benzoyl peroxide alone in the treatment of non - inflammatory lesions of acne .
