3 DOSAGE FORMS & STRENGTHS Cephalexin For Oral Suspension USP 125 mg / 5 mL and 250 mg / 5 mL For oral suspension : 125 mg / 5 mL and 250 mg / 5 mL ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Cephalexin is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalexin or other members of the cephalosporin class of antibacterial drugs .
Patients with known hypersensitivity to cephalexin or other members of the cephalosporin class of antibacterial drugs .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Serious hypersensitivity ( anaphylactic ) reactions : Prior to use , inquire regarding history of hypersensitivity to beta - lactam antibacterial drugs .
Discontinue the drug if signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction occur and institute supportive measures .
( 5 . 1 ) • Clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) : Evaluate if diarrhea occurs .
( 5 . 2 ) • Direct Coomb ' s Test Seroconversion : If anemia develops during or after cephalexin therapy , evaluate for drug - induced hemolytic anemia .
( 5 . 3 ) • Seizure Potential : Use lower dose in patients with renal impairment .
( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Allergic reactions in the form of rash , urticaria , angioedema , anaphylaxis , erythema multiforme , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported with the use of cephalexin .
Before therapy with cephalexin is instituted , inquire whether the patient has a history of hypersensitivity reactions to cephalexin , cephalosporins , penicillins , or other drugs .
Cross - hypersensitivity among beta - lactam antibacterial drugs may occur in up to 10 % of patients with a history of penicillin allergy .
If an allergic reaction to cephalexin occurs , discontinue the drug and institute appropriate treatment .
5 . 2 Clostridium difficile - Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including cephalexin , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B , which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin - producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibiotic treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
5 . 3 Direct Coombs ' Test Seroconversion Positive direct Coombs ’ tests have been reported during treatment with the cephalosporin antibacterial drugs including cephalexin .
Acute intravascular hemolysis induced by cephalexin therapy has been reported .
If anemia develops during or after cephalexin therapy , perform a diagnostic work - up for drug - induced hemolytic anemia , discontinue cephalexin and institute appropriate therapy .
5 . 4 Seizure Potential Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures , particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced .
If seizures occur , discontinue cephalexin .
Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated .
5 . 5 Prolonged Prothrombin Time Cephalosporins may be associated with prolonged prothrombin time .
Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment , or poor nutritional state , as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antibacterial therapy , and patients receiving anticoagulant therapy .
Monitor prothrombin time in patients at risk and manage as indicated .
5 . 6 Development of Drug - Resistant Bacteria Prescribing cephalexin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria .
Prolonged use of cephalexin may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms .
Careful observation of the patient is essential .
If superinfection occurs during therapy , appropriate measures should be taken .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious events are described in greater detail in the Warning and Precautions section : • Hypersensitivity reactions [ see Warning and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Direct Coombs ' Test Seroconversion [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Seizure Potential [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Effect on Prothrombin Activity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Development of Drug - Resistant Bacteria [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] The most common adverse reactions associated with cephalexin include diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , dyspepsia and abdominal pain .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In clinical trials , the most frequent adverse reaction was diarrhea .
Nausea and vomiting , dyspepsia , gastritis , and abdominal pain have also occurred .
As with penicillins and other cephalosporins , transient hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported .
Other reactions have included hypersensitivity reactions , genital and anal pruritus , genital candidiasis , vaginitis and vaginal discharge , dizziness , fatigue , headache , agitation , confusion , hallucinations , arthralgia , arthritis , and joint disorder .
Reversible interstitial nephritis has been reported .
Eosinophilia , neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , hemolytic anemia , and slight elevations in aspartate transaminase ( AST ) and alanine transaminase ( ALT ) have been reported .
In addition to the adverse reactions listed above that have been observed in patients treated with cephalexin , the following adverse reactions and other altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin class antibacterial drugs : Other Adverse Reactions : Fever , colitis , aplastic anemia , hemorrhage , renal dysfunction , and toxic nephropathy .
Altered Laboratory Tests : Prolonged prothrombin time , increased blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , increased creatinine , elevated alkaline phosphatase , elevated bilirubin , elevated lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , pancytopenia , leukopenia , and agranulocytosis .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Metformin : increased metformin concentrations .
Monitor for hypoglycemia .
( 7 . 1 ) • Probenecid - The renal excretion of cephalexin is inhibited by probenecid .
Co - administration of probenecid with cephalexin is not recommended .
( 7 . 2 ) • Administration of cephalexin may result in a false - positive reaction for glucose in the urine .
( 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Metformin Administration of cephalexin with metformin results in increased plasma metformin concentrations and decreased renal clearance of metformin .
Careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of metformin is recommended in patients concomitantly taking cephalexin and metformin [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
7 . 2 Probenecid The renal excretion of cephalexin is inhibited by probenecid .
Co - administration of probenecid with cephalexin is not recommended .
7 . 3 Interaction with Laboratory or Diagnostic Testing A false - positive reaction may occur when testing for the presence of glucose in the urine using Benedict ' s solution or Fehling ' s solution .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Reproduction studies have been performed on mice and rats using oral doses of cephalexin monohydrate 0 . 6 and 1 . 5 times the maximum daily human dose ( 66 mg / kg / day ) based upon body surface area basis , and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Cephalexin is excreted in human milk .
Caution should be exercised when cephalexin is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of cephalexin in pediatric patients was established in clinical trials for the dosages described in the dosage and administration section [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 701 subjects in 3 published clinical studies of cephalexin , 433 ( 62 % ) were 65 and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
This drug is substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Cephalexin should be administered with caution in the presence of impaired renal function ( creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min , with or without dialysis ) .
Under such conditions , careful clinical observation and laboratory studies renal function monitoring should be conducted because safe dosage may be lower than that usually recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Symptoms of oral overdose may include nausea , vomiting , epigastric distress , diarrhea , and hematuria .
In the event of an overdose , institute general supportive measures .
Forced diuresis , peritoneal dialysis , hemodialysis , or charcoal hemoperfusion have not been established as beneficial for an overdose of cephalexin .

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION • Advise patients that allergic reactions , including serious allergic reactions , could occur and that serious reactions require immediate treatment .
Ask the patient about any previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalexin , other beta - lactams ( including cephalosporins ) or other allergens ( 5 . 1 ) • Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibacterial drugs and usually resolves when the drug is discontinued .
Sometimes , frequent watery or bloody diarrhea may occur and may be a sign of a more serious intestinal infection .
If severe watery or bloody diarrhea develops , advise patients to contact their healthcare provider .
• Counsel patients that antibacterial drugs including cephalexin , should only be used to treat bacterial infections .
They do not treat viral infections ( e . g . , the common cold ) .
When cephalexin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection , tell patients that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy , the medication should be taken exactly as directed .
Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may ( 1 ) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and ( 2 ) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by cephalexin or other antibacterial drugs in the future .
