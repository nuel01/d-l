• Initiate imaging immediately after administration of Choline C11 Injection and acquire static emission images 0 – 15 minutes from the time of injection ( 2 . 5 ) .
• The effective radiation absorbed dose from 740 MBq ( 20 mCi ) dose of Choline C 11 Injection is approximately 3 . 22 mSv ( 0 . 32 rem ) in an adult ( 2 . 4 ) .
• Image interpretation : Refer to full prescribing information ( 2 . 5 ) .
2 . 1 Radiation Safety - Drug Handling Choline C 11 Injection is a radioactive drug and should be handled with appropriate safety measures to minimize radiation exposure during administration .
Use waterproof gloves and effective shielding when handling Choline C 11 Injection .
Radiopharmaceuticals , including Choline C 11 Injection , should only be used by or under the control of physicians who are qualified by specific training and experience in the safe use and handling of radioactive materials , and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate governmental agency authorized to license the use of radionuclides .
2 . 2 Recommended Dose and Administration Instructions The recommended dose is 370 – 740 MBq ( 10 – 20 mCi ) administered as a bolus intravenous injection .
The radioactivity dose ( 370 – 740 MBq , 10 – 20 mCi ) is chosen based on patient body dimensions and the characteristics of the image acquisition system • Inspect Choline C 11 Injection visually for particulate matter and discoloration before administration .
Do not use the drug if the solution contains particulate matter or is discolored .
• Aseptically withdraw Choline C 11 Injection from its container and administer the drug as a bolus through a peripheral venous catheter .
• Dispose of any unused drug in a safe manner , in compliance with applicable regulations .
2 . 3 Patient Preparation Prior to administration of Choline C 11 Injection : • Fasting for at least six hours is recommended to minimize the potential for dietary choline interference with radioactivity uptake in tissue .
• Ensure that the patient is well hydrated and encourage voiding when imaging is completed .
2 . 4 Radiation Dosimetry The estimated radiation absorbed doses for adults from intravenous injection of Choline C 11 Injection are shown in Table 1 .
These estimates are calculated from data in Tolvanen 1 and using OLINDA / EXM ( Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment / Exponential Modeling ) software from Vanderbilt University .
2 Table 1 : Estimated Radiation Absorbed Dose Per Unit Activity for Adults , Choline C 11 Injection Organ / Tissue Mean Absorbed Dose Per Unit Administered Activity ( μGy / MBq ) b Adrenals 3 . 59 Bone - Osteogenic Cells 4 . 81 Bone - Red Marrow 1 . 90 Brain 1 . 16 Breast 1 . 39 Gallbladder Wall 4 . 54 GI a - Lower Large Intestine Wall 1 . 81 GI a - Small Intestine 2 . 35 GI a - Stomach Wall 6 . 00 GI a - Upper Large Intestine Wall 6 . 41 Heart wall 3 . 43 Kidneys 20 . 62 Liver 20 . 11 Lungs 4 . 59 Muscle 2 . 54 Ovaries 2 . 02 Pancreas 29 . 19 Skin 1 . 22 Spleen 9 . 16 Testes 1 . 36 Thymus 1 . 69 Thyroid 1 . 49 Urinary Bladder Wall 3 . 41 Uterus 1 . 96 Total Body 2 . 97 Effective Dose ( µSv / MBq ) c 4 . 35 aGastrointestinal bAssumed radiation weighting factor , w r , ( formerly defined as quality factor , Q ) of 1 for conversion of absorbed dose ( Gray or rad ) to dose equivalent ( Sieverts or rem ) for C 11 .
To obtain radiation absorbed dose in rad / mCi from the above table , multiply the dose in μGy / MBq by 0 . 0037 , ( e . g . , 3 . 59 μGy / MBq x 0 . 0037 = 0 . 0133 rad / mCi ) .
cRadiation tissue weighting factors , wT , used in the calculation of effective dose are from 1990 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection , ICRP Publication 60 ( 1991 ) .
To obtain radiation absorbed dose in rem / mCi from above table , multiply the dose in μGy / MBq by 0 . 0037 , ( e . g . , 4 . 35 μGy / MBq x 0 . 0037 = 0 . 0161 rem / mCi ) .
The effective dose resulting from a 740 MBq ( 20 mCi ) dosage of Choline C 11 Injection is 3 . 22 mSv in an adult , ( 740 x 4 . 35 = 3219 μSv = 3 . 22 mSv ) .
The use of a CT scan to calculate attenuation correction for reconstruction of 11 C - choline images ( as done in PET / CT imaging ) will add radiation exposure .
Based upon current scanning techniques , an effective dose of 5 . 8 mSv would be added from CT scanning .
The actual radiation dose is operator , scanner , and patient dependent .
The total radiation exposure from 11 C - choline administration and subsequent scan on a PET / CT scanner is estimated to be 9 . 0 mSv ( 3 . 2 mSv + 5 . 8 mSv ) .
2 . 5 Imaging Guidelines • Initiate image acquisition immediately after administration of Choline C 11 Injection .
Imaging is typically performed from the base of the pelvis to the base of the skull .
• Acquire static emission images 0 to 15 minutes from the time of injection .
• Localized uptake of 11 C - choline in a site suspicious for prostate cancer recurrence ( a positive image ) is determined by comparison of the anatomical relationship of concentrated radioactivity to the neighboring tissue background , exclusive of the radioactivity physiologically accumulated within the pancreas , liver , spleen , kidney and colon .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Choline C 11 Injection contains 148 MBq to 3 , 700 MBq ( 4 mCi to 100 mCi ) per milliliter of 11 C - choline at End of Synthesis ( EOS ) calibration time in aqueous 0 . 9 % sodium chloride solution ( approximately 10 mL volume ) .
Choline C 11 Injection contains 148 MBq to 3 , 700 MBq ( 4 mCi to 100 mCi ) per milliliter of 11 C - choline at End of Synthesis ( EOS ) calibration time in aqueous 0 . 9 % sodium chloride solution ( approximately 10 mL volume ) .
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None None 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Imaging errors have been reported ; blood PSA levels < 2 ng / mL have been associated with poor imaging performance ( 5 . 1 ) .
• Allergic reactions : have emergency resuscitation equipment and personnel readily available ( 5 . 2 ) .
• Radiation risk : Choline C 11 Injection contributes to a patient ’ s long - term cumulative radiation exposure .
Ensure safe handling to protect the patient and health care worker ( 5 . 3 ) .
5 . 1 Imaging Errors Imaging errors have been reported with 11 C - choline PET and PET / CT imaging .
A negative image does not rule out the presence of recurrent prostate cancer and a positive image does not confirm the presence of recurrent cancer .
11 C - choline uptake is not specific for prostate cancer and may occur with other types of cancer ( such as lung carcinoma and brain tumors ) .
Clinical correlation , including histopathological evaluation of the suspected recurrence site , is essential to proper use of the PET imaging information .
• Blood PSA levels < 2 ng / mL have been associated with poor performance of 11 C - choline PET imaging ( higher numbers of false positive and false negative results ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
• Tissue inflammation as well as prostatic hyperplasia have been associated with false positive 11 C - choline PET images .
• Concomitant colchicine or androgen - deprivation therapeutic drugs ( such as luteinizing hormone - releasing analogs and anti - androgen drugs ) may interfere with 11 C - choline PET imaging .
One published report of 18 F - methylcholine PET imaging indicated that discontinuation of colchicine for two weeks resolved the colchicine effect .
The impact of discontinuation of androgen - deprivation therapy upon 11 C - choline PET imaging has not been established [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
5 . 2 Allergic Reactions As with any injectable drug product , allergic reactions and anaphylaxis may occur .
Emergency resuscitation equipment and personnel should be immediately available .
5 . 3 Radiation Risks Choline C 11 Injection contributes to a patient ’ s overall long - term cumulative radiation exposure .
Long - term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk for cancer .
Safe handling should be ensured to minimize radiation exposure to the patient and health care workers [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Exclusive of an uncommon , mild injection site reaction , no adverse reactions to 11 C - Choline have been reported .
Exclusion of an uncommon , mild injection site reaction , no other adverse reactions have been reported ( 6 ) .
To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact UT MD Anderson Cancer Center , Cyclotron Radiochemistry Facility at 713 - 563 - 5455 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Colchicine and androgen - deprivation therapeutic drugs have been reported to interfere with choline - based PET imaging [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The impact of androgen - deprivation therapeutic drugs upon 11 C - choline PET imaging may depend upon the hormonal responsiveness of a patient ’ s recurrent prostate cancer .
Clinical studies have not established this relationship but published reports suggest 11 C - choline PET imaging may be productive in patients with “ hormone resistant ” recurrent prostate cancer even if the patients are receiving anti - androgen therapy .
Imaging may prove unproductive or misleading due to failed or insufficient 11 C - choline uptake in patients with hormone - responsive cancer if the patients are receiving androgen - deprivation therapy .
Colchicine and androgen - deprivation therapeutic drugs may interfere with 11 C - choline PET / CT imaging performance ( 5 . 1 ) .
See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C .
There are no adequate and well controlled studies with Choline C 11 Injection in pregnant women and the fetal radiation dose from a 11 C - choline PET imaging study is unknown .
It is not known whether Choline C 11 Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with 11 C - choline .
All radiopharmaceuticals , including Choline C 11 Injection , have a potential to cause fetal harm .
The likelihood of fetal harm depends on the stage of fetal development and the magnitude of the radiopharmaceutical dose .
Assess pregnancy status before administering Choline C 11 Injection to a female of child bearing potential .
Choline C 11 Injection should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Choline C 11 Injection is not indicated for use in women .
It is not known whether Choline C 11 Injection is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for radiation exposure to nursing infants from Choline C 11 Injection , nursing mothers should use alternative infant nutrition sources ( e . g . , stored breast milk or infant formula ) and pump and discard breast milk for 8 hours ( > 10 half - lives of radioactive decay for 11 C isotope ) after administration of the drug or avoid use of the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Choline C 11 Injection have not been established in pediatric patients .
11 DESCRIPTION 11 . 1 Chemical Characteristics Choline C 11 Injection is a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical that is used for diagnostic purposes in conjunction with PET imaging .
The active ingredient , 11 C - choline , has the molecular formula of C4 11 CH 14 NOCl with a molecular weight of 138 . 63 g and has the following chemical structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Choline C 11 Injection is provided as a ready to use sterile , pyrogen - free , clear and colorless solution .
Each milliliter contains 148 MBq to 3 , 700 MBq ( 4 mCi - 100 mCi ) of 11 C - choline at EOS calibration time in aqueous 0 . 9 % sodium chloride solution .
The pH of the solution is between 4 . 5 and 8 . 0 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 11 . 2 Physical Characteristics Carbon 11 is a cyclotron - produced radionuclide that decays to Boron 11 by positron emission and has a physical half - life of 20 . 4 minutes ( Table 2 ) .
Table 2 : Principal Radiation Emission Data for 11 C [ MULTIMEDIA ] * Produced by positron annihilation [ MULTIMEDIA ] The specific gamma ray constant ( point source air kerma coefficient ) for 11 C - choline is 5 . 8 R / mCi - hr at 1 cm .
Selected coefficients of attenuation are listed in Table 3 as a function of lead shield thickness .
For example , the use of 39 mm thickness of lead will attenuate the external radiation by a factor of about 1 , 000 .
Table 3 : Radiation Attenuation of 511 keV Photons by lead ( Pb ) shielding [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Table 4 lists fractions remaining at selected time intervals from the calibration time .
This information may be used to correct for physical decay of the radionuclide .
Table 4 : Physical Decay Chart for 11 C [ MULTIMEDIA ] * Calibration time [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Choline C 11 Injection is a radiolabeled analog of choline , a precursor molecule essential for the biosynthesis of cell membrane phospholipids .
Choline is involved in synthesis of the structural components of cell membranes , as well as modulation of trans - membrane signaling .
Increased phospholipid synthesis ( i . e . , increased uptake of choline ) has been associated with cell proliferation and the transformation process that occurs in tumor cells .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In a study of men with prostatic hyperplasia or primary prostate cancer , PET imaging showed 11 C - choline radioactivity accumulated rapidly within the prostate ; uptake appeared to peak by five minutes following injection of the drug and activity was retained over the subsequent 30 minute scanning period .
Little uptake was observed in the bladder and rectum .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution : 11 C - choline distributes mainly to the pancreas , kidneys , liver , spleen and colon [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Based upon the relatively low urinary excretion of radioactivity , renal distribution is predominantly to the organ itself , rather than via formation of urine .
Metabolism : Following intravenous administration , 11 C - choline undergoes metabolism resulting in the detection of 11 C - betaine as the major metabolite in blood .
In a study of patients with prostate cancer or brain disorders , the fractional activities of 11 C - choline and 11 C - betaine in human arterial plasma appeared to reach a plateau within 25 minutes , with 11 C - betaine representing 82 % ± 9 % of the total 11 C detected at that time point .
A small amount of unmetabolized 11 C - choline was detected within the blood at the final sampling time point ( 40 minutes ) .
Elimination : Urinary excretion of 11 C - choline was < 2 % of the injected radioactivity at 1 . 5 hours after injection of the drug .
The rate of 11 C - choline excretion in urine was 0 . 014 mL / min .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long term studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Choline C 11 Injection .
The mutagenic potential of Choline C 11 Injection has not been adequately evaluated ; however , any radiopharmaceutical , including Choline C 11 Injection , has the potential to be mutagenic .
The effect of Choline C 11 Injection on fertility has not been evaluated .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES A systematic review of published reports identified four studies that contained data sufficient to compare 11 C - choline PET imaging to histopathology ( truth standard ) among patients with suspected prostate cancer recurrence and non - informative conventional imaging ( for most patients , CT or MRI ) .
In general , the suspected recurrence criteria consisted of at least two sequential PSA levels of > 0 . 2 ng / mL for men who had undergone prostatectomy and PSA levels of ≥ 2 ng / mL above the post - therapy nadir for men who had undergone radiotherapy .
The studies were predominantly single clinical site experiences and image acquisition generally surveyed radioactivity distribution from the base of the pelvis to the base of the skull .
Prospective studies : Two studies examined the ability of 11 C - choline PET / CT to detect prostate cancer in pelvic and / or retroperitoneal lymph nodes among patients who had previously undergone radical prostatectomy .
Both studies used a truth standard of lymph node histopathology .
11 C - choline images were interpreted by readers masked to clinical information ; surgical resection of lymph nodes was performed by surgeons aware of the 11 C - choline PET / CT results .
In Study One 3 , 25 patients who underwent 11 C - choline PET / CT and conventional imaging ( CT or MRI ) were scheduled to undergo pelvic or pelvic plus retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy following the imaging identification of suspected lymph node metastases .
The median PSA was 2 . 0 ng / mL ( range 0 . 2 to 23 . 1 ng / mL ) .
The study excluded subjects with metastatic disease detected by bone scintigraphy or isolated prostatic fossa recurrence .
Among the 25 patients , 21 had positive 11 C - choline PET / CT scans ; histopathology verified cancer in 19 of these patients .
Lymph node histopathology detected no cancer among the four patients who had surgery based only on positive conventional imaging ; 11 C - choline PET / CT was negative in all four patients .
The study report included information for patients who had non - informative conventional imaging ( CT or MRI , bone scintigraphy and transrectal ultrasound ) , as shown in Table 5 .
In Study Two 4 , 15 patients were scheduled to undergo pelvic or pelvis plus retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy solely based upon positive 11 C - choline PET / CT imaging in the setting of negative conventional imaging ( ultrasound and / or CT and / or MRI and / or bone scintigraphy ) .
The median PSA was 2 . 0 ng / mL ( range 1 . 0 to 8 . 0 ng / mL ) ; all patients had previously undergone radical prostatectomy .
Eight of the 15 patients had cancer verified by lymph node histology ; histology detected no cancer in seven patients .
Retrospective Studies : Two studies were retrospective reviews of patients who underwent 11 C - choline PET / CT and had histopathology obtained from biopsy of the prostatic fossa or other suspected recurrence sites .
In Study Three 5 , 11 C - choline PET / CT imaging was performed among 36 patients with suspected prostate cancer recurrence and 13 subjects without suspected recurrence ( controls ) .
Prostatic fossa biopsies were performed among the patients with suspected recurrence .
All the patients and control subjects had previously undergone radical prostatectomy ; patient with suspected recurrence had no evidence of cancer using conventional clinical evaluations , including trans - rectal ultrasound and bone scintigraphy .
PET / CT scans were interpreted by readers masked to clinical information .
Median PSA was 2 . 0 ng / mL ( range 0 . 3 – 12 . 1 ng / mL ) for patients with suspected recurrence and 0 . 1 ng / mL ( range 0 . 0 – 0 . 2 ng / mL ) in control subjects .
Prostatic fossa biopsy showed cancer in 33 of the 36 patients with suspected recurrence .
PET / CT scans were positive in 25 of the 36 patients ; two patients had false positive scans ( one scan in a control subject and one scan in a suspected recurrence subject who had no cancer detected on prostatic fossa biopsy ) .
Among the 13 control subjects , 12 had negative PET / CT scans .
In Study Four 6 , 7 , 34 patients with negative conventional imaging underwent 11 C - choline PET / CT and subsequently had biopsies of suspected recurrence sites .
The median PSA level of the 34 patients was 3 . 9 ng / mL ( range 0 . 2 to 65 . 0 ng / mL ) ; 22 of the patients had previously undergone radical prostatectomy and 12 had received other therapy ( radiotherapy , anti - androgen therapy or cryotherapy ) .
11 C - choline PET / CT images were positive in 30 patients and negative in four patients .
Cancer was verified by histopathology in 29 patients ; 25 had positive PET / CT images and four had negative PET / CT images .
Five patients with positive PET / CT images did not have cancer confirmed with histopathology .
As shown in Table 5 , within each study at least half the patients with non - informative conventional imaging had positive 11 C - choline PET / CT images and histologically verified recurrent prostate cancer .
Table 5 : 11 Choline PET / CT Results among Patients with Non - informative Conventional Imaging and a Histopathology Truth Standard [ MULTIMEDIA ] * ND = not determined [ MULTIMEDIA ] In Studies Three and Four , PSA levels were generally lower for patients with negative 11 C - choline PET / CT results than for patients with positive results .
In Study Three , the median PSA was 2 . 6 ng / mL ( range 0 . 6 – 12 . 1 ng / mL ) among the 23 patients with true positive images ; nine out of 11 patients with false negative or false positive images had PSA levels < 2 ng / mL .
In Study Four , the median PSA was 4 . 2 ng / mL ( range 0 . 2 – 65 . 0 ng / mL ) among the 25 patients with true positive images ; PSA levels < 2 ng / mL were observed in four of the nine patients with false negative or false positive images .
These data , combined with other published reports , suggest that 11 C - choline PET imaging performance may be more reliable among patients with blood PSA levels > 2 ng / mL , compared to patients with lower levels .
