DEXYCU is a corticosteroid indicated for the treatment of postoperative inflammation ( 1 ) .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • For intraocular administration ( 2 ) .
• Administer 0 . 005 mL of DEXYCU into the posterior chamber inferiorly behind the iris at the end of ocular surgery ( 2 ) .
2 . 1 Dosing Information DEXYCU should be administered as a single dose , intraocularly in the posterior chamber at the end of surgery .
The dose is 0 . 005 mL of dexamethasone 9 % ( equivalent to 517 micrograms ) .
2 . 2 Preparation and Administration Each kit of DEXYCU is for a single administration .
After preparation , 0 . 005 mL will be administered .
The DEXYCU administration kit contains the following items : [ MULTIMEDIA ] • One glass vial : 0 . 5 mL of DEXYCU • One sterile 1 - mL syringe • One sterile syringe guide • One sterile syringe ring • One sterile 18 - gauge needle ( 1 ½ inches long ) , plastic cap attached • One sterile 25 - gauge bent cannula ( 8 mm long ) , plastic cap attached Step 1 .
Prepare a sterile field .
Remove the components of the administration kit from their respective pouches : • syringe • syringe guide • syringe ring • needle • cannula Place onto the sterile field .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Step 2 .
Withdraw the syringe plunger approximately 1 inch .
Place the syringe ring on the plunger ( slit facing the plunger ) .
Apply slight downward pressure until the syringe ring " snaps " into place .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Step 3 .
Place the 18 - gauge needle firmly on the syringe .
Remove the cap from the needle .
Depress the plunger completely and then withdraw the plunger to fill the syringe with air .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Step 4 .
Mix using a vortex mixer or vigorously shake the vial of DEXYCU sideways for a minimum of 30 seconds .
The suspended drug material must be used immediately after shaking .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Step 5 .
Remove the blue plastic flip - cap from the vial and wipe the top of rubber stopper with an alcohol pad .
Invert the vial .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Step 6 .
Insert the needle into the vial and inject the air into the vial .
Making sure the needle tip is immersed in the drug material pooled in the neck of the inverted vial , fill the syringe by slowly withdrawing the plunger approximately 0 . 2 mL .
Remove the needle from the vial and discard the unused portion in the vial .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Step 7 .

None ( 4 ) .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Increase in Intraocular Pressure ( IOP ) : Monitor for increases in IOP ( 5 . 1 ) .
• Delayed Healing : Monitor for delayed healing ( 5 . 2 ) .
• Infection Exacerbation : Monitor and treat for any exacerbations of bacterial , viral or fungal infections ( 5 . 3 ) .
• Cataract Progression : Cataracts may develop or progress in phakic patients ( 5 . 4 ) .
5 . 1 Increase in Intraocular Pressure Prolonged use of corticosteroids including DEXYCU may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve , defects in visual acuity and fields of vision .
Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma .
5 . 2 Delayed Healing The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation .
In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera , perforations have been known to occur with the use of corticosteroids .
5 . 3 Exacerbation of Infection The use of DEXYCU , as with other ophthalmic corticosteroids , is not recommended in the presence of most active viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including epithelial herpes simplex keratitis ( dendritic keratitis ) , vaccinia , and varicella , and also in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal disease of ocular structures .
Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires caution .
Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye ( including herpes simplex ) .
Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long - term local steroid application .
Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use .
Fungal culture should be taken when appropriate .
Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections .
In acute purulent conditions , steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection .
5 . 4 Cataract Progression The use of corticosteroids in phakic individuals may promote the development of posterior subcapsular cataracts .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • Increase in Intraocular Pressure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Delayed Healing [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Infection Exacerbation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Cataract Progression [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] In controlled studies , the most common adverse reactions reported by 5 - 15 % of patients were intraocular pressure increased , corneal edema and iritis ( 6 . 1 ) .

The most commonly reported adverse reactions occurred in 5 - 15 % of subjects and included increases in intraocular pressure , corneal edema and iritis .
Other ocular adverse reactions occurring in 1 - 5 % of subjects included , corneal endothelial cell loss , blepharitis , eye pain , cystoid macular edema , dry eye , ocular inflammation , posterior capsule opacification , blurred vision , reduced visual acuity , vitreous floaters , foreign body sensation , photophobia , and vitreous detachment .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of DEXYCU ( dexamethasone intraocular suspension ) 9 % in pregnant women .
Topical ocular administration of dexamethasone in mice and rabbits during the period of organogenesis produced cleft palate and embryofetal death in mice and malformations of abdominal wall / intestines and kidneys in rabbits at doses 7 and 5 times higher than the injected recommended human ophthalmic dose ( RHOD ) of DEXYCU ( 517 micrograms dexamethasone ) , respectively [ see Data ] .
In the US general population the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Topical ocular administration of 0 . 15 % dexamethasone ( 0 . 75 mg / kg / day ) on gestational days 10 to 13 produced embryofetal lethality and a high incidence of cleft palate in mice .
A dose of 0 . 75 mg / kg / day in the mouse is approximately 7 - times the injected RHOD of DEXYCU , on a mg / m2 basis .
In rabbits , topical ocular administration of 0 . 1 % dexamethasone throughout organogenesis ( 0 . 20 mg / kg / day on gestational day 6 , followed by 0 . 13 mg / kg / day on gestational days 7 – 18 ) produced intestinal anomalies , intestinal aplasia , gastroschisis and hypoplastic kidneys .
A dose of 0 . 13 mg / kg / day in the rabbit is approximately 5 - times the injected RHOD of DEXYCU , on a mg / m2 basis .
A no - observed - adverse - effect - level ( NOAEL ) was not identified in the mouse or rabbit studies .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Systemically administered corticosteroids are present in human milk and can suppress growth , interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production , or cause other unwanted effects .
There is no information regarding the presence of injected DEXYCU in human milk , the effects on breastfed infants , or the effects on milk production to inform risk of DEXYCU to an infant during lactation .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered , along with the mother ' s clinical need for DEXYCU and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from DEXYCU .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of DEXYCU in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between older and younger patients .

Corticosteroids have been shown to suppress inflammation by inhibiting multiple inflammatory cytokines resulting in decreased edema , fibrin deposition , capillary leakage and migration of inflammatory cells .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Systemic exposure to dexamethasone was evaluated in a subgroup of patients enrolled in two studies ( n = 25 for the first study and n = 13 for the second study ) .
The patients received a single intraocular injection of DEXYCU containing 342 mcg or 517 mcg of dexamethasone at the end of cataract surgery and blood samples were collected prior to surgery and at several time points post - surgery between Day 1 and up to Day 30 .
In the first study , the dexamethasone plasma concentrations on post - surgery Day 1 ranged from 0 . 09 to 0 . 86 ng / mL and from 0 . 07 to 1 . 16 ng / mL following administration of DEXYCU 342 mcg and 517 mcg , respectively .
In the second study , dexamethasone plasma concentrations on post - surgery Day 1 ranged from 0 . 349 to 2 . 79 ng / mL following administration of DEXYCU 517 mcg .
In both the studies , dexamethasone plasma concentrations declined over time and very few patients had quantifiable dexamethasone plasma concentrations at the final time point of sampling ( Day 15 or Day 30 ) .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Animal studies have not been conducted to determine whether DEXYCU has the potential for carcinogenesis or mutagenesis .
Fertility studies have not been conducted in animals .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Clinical efficacy was evaluated in a randomized , double - masked , placebo - controlled trial ( NCT02006888 ) in which subjects received either DEXYCU or placebo ( vehicle ) .
A dose of 5 microliters of DEXYCU ( equivalent to 517 micrograms of dexamethasone ) , a dose equivalent to 342 micrograms of dexamethasone or vehicle was administered by the physician at the end of the surgical procedure .
The primary efficacy endpoint for the study was the proportion of patients with anterior chamber cell clearing ( i . e . , cell score = 0 ) on postoperative day ( POD ) 8 .
The presence of anterior cells was assessed using a slit lamp binocular microscope up to 30 days post treatment .
The percentage of patients with anterior chamber clearing at Day 8 was 20 % in the placebo group , and 57 % , and 60 % in the 342 and 517 microgram treatment groups , respectively ( Table 1 ) .
The percentage of subjects receiving rescue medication of ocular steroid or NSAID was significantly lower at Day 3 , 8 , 15 and 30 in the 342 and 517 microgram treatment groups compared to placebo ( Table 2 ) .
