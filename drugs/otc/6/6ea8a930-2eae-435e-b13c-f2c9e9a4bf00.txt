DESCRIPTION Prochieve ® ( progesterone gel ) is a bioadhesive vaginal gel containing micronized progesterone in an emulsion system , which is contained in single use , one piece polyethylene vaginal applicators .
The carrier vehicle is an oil in water emulsion containing the water swellable , but insoluble polymer , polycarbophil .
The progesterone is partially soluble in both the oil and water phase of the vehicle , with the majority of the progesterone existing as a suspension .
Physically , Prochieve ® has the appearance of a soft , white to off - white gel .
The active ingredient , progesterone , is present in either a 4 % or an 8 % concentration ( w / w ) .
The chemical name for progesterone is pregn - 4 - ene - 3 , 20 - dione .
It has an empirical formula of C21H30O2 and a molecular weight of 314 . 5 .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Progesterone exists in two polymorphic forms .
Form 1 , which is the form used in Prochieve ® , exists as white orthorhombic prisms with a melting point of 127 - 131 ° C . Each applicator delivers 1 . 125 grams of Prochieve ® gel containing either 45 mg ( 4 % gel ) or 90 mg ( 8 % gel ) of progesterone in a base containing glycerin , mineral oil , polycarbophil , carbomer 934 P , hydrogenated palm oil glyceride , sorbic acid , purified water and may contain sodium hydroxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Progesterone is a naturally occurring steroid that is secreted by the ovary , placenta , and adrenal gland .
In the presence of adequate estrogen , progesterone transforms a proliferative endometrium into a secretory endometrium .
Progesterone is essential for the development of decidual tissue , and the effect of progesterone on the differentiation of glandular epithelia and stroma has been extensively studied .
Progesterone is necessary to increase endometrial receptivity for implantation of an embryo .
Once an embryo is implanted , progesterone acts to maintain the pregnancy .
Normal or near - normal endometrial responses to oral estradiol and intramuscular progesterone have been noted in functionally agonadal women through the sixth decade of life .
Progesterone administration decreases the circulatory levels of gonadotropins .
Pharmacokinetics Absorption Due to the sustained release properties of Prochieve ® , progesterone absorption is prolonged with an absorption half - life of approximately 25 - 50 hours , and an elimination half - life of 5 - 20 minutes .
Therefore , the pharmacokinetics of Prochieve ® are rate - limited by absorption rather than by elimination .
The bioavailability of progesterone in Prochieve ® was determined relative to progesterone administered intramuscularly .
In a single dose crossover study , 20 healthy , estrogenized postmenopausal women received 45 mg or 90 mg progesterone vaginally in Prochieve ® 4 % or Prochieve ® 8 % , or 45 mg or 90 mg progesterone intramuscularly .
The pharmacokinetic parameters ( mean ± standard deviation ) are shown in Table 1 .

Metabolism The major urinary metabolite of oral progesterone is 5β - pregnan - 3α , 20α - diol glucuronide which is present in plasma in the conjugated form only .
Plasma metabolites also include 5β - pregnan - 3α - ol - 20 - one ( 5β - pregnanolone ) and 5α - pregnan - 3α - ol - 20 - one ( 5β - pregnanolone ) .
Excretion Progesterone undergoes both biliary and renal elimination .
Following an injection of labeled progesterone , 50 - 60 % of the excretion of progesterone metabolites occurs via the kidney ; approximately 10 % occurs via the bile and feces , the second major excretory pathway .
Overall recovery of labeled material accounts for 70 % of an administered dose , with the remainder of the dose not characterized with respect to elimination .
Only a small portion of unchanged progesterone is excreted in the bile .
Clinical Studies Assisted Reproductive Technology In a single - center , open - label study ( COL1620 - 007 US ) , 99 women ( aged 28 - 47 years ) with either partial ( n = 84 ) or premature ovarian failure ( n = 15 ) who were candidates to receive a donor oocyte transfer as an Assisted Reproductive Technology ( " ART " ) procedure were randomized to receive either Prochieve ® 8 % twice daily ( n = 68 ) or intramuscular progesterone 100 mg daily ( n = 31 ) .
The study was divided into three phases ( Pilot , Donor Egg and Treatment ) .
The first phase of the study consisted of a test Pilot Cycle to ensure that the administration of transdermal estradiol and progesterone would adequately prime the endometrium to receive the donor egg .
The second phase was the Donor Egg Cycle during which a fertilized oocyte was implanted .
Prochieve ® 8 % was administered beginning the evening of Day 14 of the Pilot and Donor Egg cycles .
Subjects with partial ovarian function also underwent a Pre - Pilot Cycle and a Pre - Donor Egg Cycle during which time they were administered only leuprolide acetate to suppress remaining ovarian function .
The Pre - Pilot Cycle , Pilot Cycle , Pre - Donor Egg Cycle , and Donor Egg Cycle each lasted approximately 34 days .
The third phase of the study consisted of a 10 - week treatment period to maintain a pregnancy until placental autonomy was achieved .
Sixty - one women received Prochieve ® 8 % as part of the Pilot Cycle to determine their endometrial response .
Of the 55 evaluable endometrial biopsies in the Prochieve ® 8 % group performed on Day 25 - 27 , all were histologically " in - phase " , consistent with luteal phase biopsy specimens of menstruating women at comparable time intervals .
Fifty - four women who received Prochieve ® 8 % and had a histologically " in - phase " biopsy received a donor oocyte transfer .
Among these 54 Prochieve ® - treated women , clinical pregnancies ( assessed about week 10 after transfer by clinical examination , ultrasound and / or ß - hCG levels ) occurred in 26 women ( 48 % ) .
Seventeen women ( 31 % ) delivered a total of 25 newborns , seven women ( 13 % ) had spontaneous abortions and two women ( 4 % ) had elective abortions .
In a second study ( COL1620 - F01 ) , Prochieve ® 8 % was used in luteal phase support of women with tubal or idiopathic infertility due to endometriosis and normal ovulatory cycles , undergoing in vitro fertilization ( " IVF " ) procedures .
All women received a GnRH analog to suppress endogenous progesterone , human menopausal gonadotropins , and human chorionic gonadotropin .
In this multi - center , open - label study , 139 women ( aged 22 - 38 years ) received Prochieve ® 8 % once daily beginning within 24 hours of embryo transfer and continuing through Day 30 post - transfer .
Clinical pregnancies assessed at Day 90 post - transfer were seen in 36 ( 26 % ) of women .
Thirty - two women ( 23 % ) delivered newborns and four women ( 3 % ) had spontaneous abortions .
( See PRECAUTIONS , subsection Pregnancy ) Secondary Amenorrhea In three parallel , open - label studies ( COL1620 - 004 US , COL1620 - 005 US , COL1620 - 009 US ) , 127 women ( aged 18 - 44 ) with hypothalamic amenorrhea or premature ovarian failure were randomized to receive either Prochieve ® 4 % ( n = 62 ) or Prochieve ® 8 % ( n = 65 ) .
All women were treated with either conjugated estrogens 0 . 625 mg daily ( n = 100 ) or transdermal estradiol ( delivering 50 mcg / day ) twice weekly ( n = 27 ) .
Estrogen therapy was continuous for the entire three 28 - day cycle studies .
At Day 15 of the second cycle ( six weeks after initiating estrogen replacement ) , women who demonstrated adequate response to estrogen therapy ( by ultrasound ) and who continued to be amenorrheic received Prochieve ® every other day for six doses ( Day 15 through Day 25 of the cycle ) .
In cycle 2 , Prochieve ® 4 % induced bleeding in 79 % of women and Prochieve ® 8 % induced bleeding in 77 % of women .
In the third cycle , estrogen was continued and Prochieve ® was administered every other day beginning on Day 15 for six doses .
On Day 24 an endometrial biopsy was performed .
In 53 women who received Prochieve ® 4 % , biopsy results were as follows : 7 % proliferative , 40 % late secretory , 19 % mid secretory , 13 % early secretory , 7 % atrophic , 6 % menstrual endometrium , 6 % inactive endometrium and 2 % negative endometrium .
In 54 women who received Prochieve ® 8 % , biopsy results were as follows : 44 % late secretory , 19 % mid secretory , 11 % early secretory , 19 % atrophic , 5 % menstrual endometrium and 2 % " oral contraceptive like " endometrium .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Assisted Reproductive Technology Prochieve ® 8 % is indicated for progesterone supplementation or replacement as part of an Assisted Reproductive Technology ( " ART " ) treatment for infertile women with progesterone deficiency .
Secondary Amenorrhea Prochieve ® 4 % is indicated for the treatment of secondary amenorrhea .
Prochieve ® 8 % is indicated for use in women who have failed to respond to treatment with Prochieve ® 4 % .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Prochieve ® should not be used in individuals with any of the following conditions : • Known sensitivity to Prochieve ® ( progesterone or any of the other ingredients ) • Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding • Liver dysfunction or disease • Known or suspected malignancy of the breast or genital organs • Missed abortion • Active thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders , or a history of hormone - associated thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders WARNINGS The physician should be alert to the earliest manifestations of thrombotic disorders ( thrombophlebitis , cerebrovascular disorders , pulmonary embolism , and retinal thrombosis ) .
Should any of these occur or be suspected , the drug should be discontinued immediately .
Progesterone and progestins have been used to prevent miscarriage in women with a history of recurrent spontaneous pregnancy losses .
No adequate evidence is available to show that they are effective for this purpose .
PRECAUTIONS General • The pretreatment physical examination should include special reference to breast and pelvic organs , as well as Papanicolaou smear .
• In cases of breakthrough bleeding , as in all cases of irregular vaginal bleeding , nonfunctional causes should be considered .
In cases of undiagnosed vaginal bleeding , adequate diagnostic measures should be undertaken .
• Because progestogens may cause some degree of fluid retention , conditions which might be influenced by this factor ( e . g . , epilepsy , migraine , asthma , cardiac or renal dysfunction ) require careful observation .
• The pathologist should be advised of progesterone therapy when relevant specimens are submitted .
• Patients who have a history of psychic depression should be carefully observed and the drug discontinued if the depression recurs to a serious degree .
• A decrease in glucose tolerance has been observed in a small percentage of patients on estrogen - progestin combination drugs .
The mechanism of this decrease is not known .
For this reason , diabetic patients should be carefully observed while receiving progestin therapy .
Information for Patients The product should not be used concurrently with other local intravaginal therapy .
If other local intravaginal therapy is to be used concurrently , there should be at least a 6 - hour period before or after Prochieve ® administration .
Small , white globules may appear as a vaginal discharge possibly due to gel accumulation , even several days after usage .
Drug Interactions No drug interactions have been assessed with Prochieve ® .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Nonclinical toxicity studies to determine the potential of Prochieve ® to cause carcinogenicity or mutagenicity have not been performed .
The effect of Prochieve ® on fertility has not been evaluated in animals .
Pregnancy ( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , subsection Clinical Studies ) Prochieve ® 8 % has been used to support embryo implantation and maintain pregnancies through its use as part of ART treatment regimens in two clinical studies ( studies COL1620 - 007 US and COL1620 - F01 ) .
In the first study ( COL1620 - 007 US ) , 54 Prochieve ® - treated women had donor oocyte transfer procedures , and clinical pregnancies occurred in 26 women ( 48 % ) .
The outcomes of these 26 pregnancies were as follows : one woman had an elective termination of pregnancy at 19 weeks due to congenital malformations ( omphalocele ) associated with a chromosomal abnormality ; one woman pregnant with triplets had an elective termination of her pregnancy ; seven women had spontaneous abortions ; and 17 women delivered 25 apparently normal newborns .
In the second study ( COL1620 - F01 ) , Prochieve ® 8 % was used in the luteal phase support of women undergoing in vitro fertilization ( " IVF " ) procedures .
In this multi - center , open - label study , 139 women received Prochieve ® 8 % once daily beginning within 24 hours of embryo transfer and continuing through Day 30 post - transfer .
Clinical pregnancies assessed at Day 90 post - transfer were seen in 36 ( 26 % ) of women .
Thirty - two women ( 23 % ) delivered newborns and four women ( 3 % ) had spontaneous abortions .
Of the 47 newborns delivered , one had a teratoma associated with a cleft palate ; one had respiratory distress syndrome ; 44 were apparently normal and one was lost to follow - up .
Geriatric Use The safety and effectiveness in geriatric patients ( over age 65 ) have not been established .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Nursing Mothers Detectable amounts of progestins have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving them .
The effect of this on the nursing infant has not been determined .

This leaflet does not take the place of discussions with your doctor .
If you still have any questions , ask your doctor or health - care provider .
What Prochieve ® is Prochieve ® is a specially formulated gel that you insert in your vagina .
It contains the natural female hormone called progesterone .
Prochieve ® 8 % is used as part of a program for women who are undergoing fertility treatment .
Understanding the role of Prochieve ® in your infertility treatment Progesterone is one of the hormones essential for maintaining a pregnancy .
If you are undergoing ART treatment and your doctor has determined your body does not produce enough progesterone on its own , Prochieve ® may be prescribed to provide the progesterone you need .
The progesterone in Prochieve ® will help prepare the lining of your uterus so that it is ready to receive and nourish a fertilized egg .
If pregnancy occurs , Prochieve ® may be supplemented for 10 - 12 weeks until production of progesterone by the placenta is adequate .
When you should not use Prochieve ® • If you are allergic to progesterone , progesterone - like drugs , or any of the inactive ingredients in the gel ( ask a pharmacist if you are not sure about the inactive ingredients in Prochieve ® ) .
• If you have unusual vaginal bleeding which has not been evaluated by a doctor .
• If you have a liver disease .
• If you have known or suspected cancer of the breast or genital organs .
• If you have a miscarriage and your physician suspects some tissue is still in the uterus .
• If you have or have had blood clots in the legs , lungs , eyes , or elsewhere .
Risks of Prochieve ® • Risk to the fetus .
Birth defects have been reported in the offspring of women who were using Prochieve ® during early pregnancy .
These included an abdominal wall defect and a cleft palate .
A causal association has been neither confirmed nor refuted .
You should check with your doctor about the risks to your unborn child of any medication used during pregnancy .
• Blood clots and related health problems .
Blood clots have been reported with the use of estrogens and progestational drugs ( alone or in combination ) .
If blood clots do form in your bloodstream , they can cut off the blood supply to vital organs , causing serious problems .
These problems may include a stroke ( by cutting off blood to part of the brain ) , a heart attack ( by cutting off blood to part of the heart ) , a pulmonary embolus ( by cutting off blood to part of the lungs ) , or other problems .
Any of these conditions may cause death or serious long - term disability .
Call your doctor immediately if you suspect you have any of these conditions .
He or she may advise you to stop using this drug .
PRECAUTIONS Be alert for unusual signs and symptoms .
If any of these warning signals ( or any other unusual symptoms ) happen while you are using Prochieve ® , call your doctor immediately : • Abnormal bleeding from the vagina .
• Pains in the calves or chest , a sudden shortness of breath or coughing blood indicating possible clots in the legs , heart , or lungs .
• Severe headache or vomiting , dizziness , faintness , or changes in vision or speech , weakness or numbness of an arm or leg indicating possible clots in the brain or eye .
• Breast lumps , which could be associated with fibrocystic disorders , fibroadenoma , or breast cancer .
( Ask your doctor or health - care provider to show you how to examine your breasts monthly . )
• Yellowing of the skin and / or white of the eyes indicating possible liver problems .
You should also notify your doctor if you experience depression , worsening of your diabetic condition , or fluid retention .
Possible side effects of Prochieve ® In addition to the risks listed above , the following side effects have been reported with Prochieve ® used either for progesterone supplementation or for replacement as part of an ART treatment for infertile women with progesterone deficiency .
Consult your doctor if you experience any of the side effects mentioned below , or other side effects .
SIDE EFFECTS REPORTED AT A FREQUENCY OF 5 % OR GREATER • abdominal pain ; perineal pain ( the perineum is the area between the vagina and the rectum ) • headache • constipation ; diarrhea ; nausea • joint pain • depression ; decreased libido ; nervousness ; sleepiness [ 1 ] • breast enlargement • excessive urination at night SIDE EFFECTS REPORTED AT A FREQUENCY RANGING FROM 1 % TO 5 % • allergy ; bloating ; cramps ; fatigue ; pain • dizziness null • vomiting • mood swings • breast pain • difficult or painful intercourse ; genital itching ; genital yeast infection ; vaginal discharge • urinary tract infection SIDE EFFECTS REPORTED AT A FREQUENCY OF LESS THAN 1 % • fever ; flu - like symptoms • water retention [ 2 ] • gastrointestinal discomfort ; gas ; abdominal swelling • back pain ; leg pain • insomnia • sinusitis ; upper respiratory tract infection • asthma • acne ; itching • painful or difficult urination ; frequent urination How Prochieve ® works Prochieve ® has been formulated to be administered through the vagina .
The moisturizing gel in Prochieve ® forms a coating on the walls of the vagina which allows for absorption of progesterone through the vaginal tissue .
Small , white globules may appear as a vaginal discharge possibly due to gel accumulation , even several days after usage .
Prochieve ® contains no irritating perfumes or dyes .

How to use Prochieve ® The dosage is one application of the 8 % gel ( 90 mg of progesterone ) vaginally , daily or twice daily as directed by your doctor .
If you become pregnant , your doctor may decide to continue treatment for up to 10 to 12 weeks .
Prochieve ® is to be applied directly from the specially designed sealed applicator into the vagina .
The applicator is designed to deliver a premeasured dose of Prochieve ® .
A small amount of gel will be left in the tube after usage .
Do not be concerned because you will still be receiving the appropriate , measured dosage .
Under certain rare circumstances , such as high altitude , brief exposure to high temperature , sudden changes in atmospheric / barometric pressure , and pressure controlled environments such as airplanes or high - rise buildings , the internal pressure of the applicator may become higher than the air pressure .
This imbalance between the internal and external pressure may cause the gel to expel from the applicator when the twist - off tab is removed .
If you should experience the gel expelling from the applicator upon opening , please follow the SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AT ALTITUDES ABOVE 2500 FEET .
• 1 .
Remove the applicator from the sealed wrapper .
DO NOT remove the twist - off tab at this time .
For use at altitudes above 2500 feet , see special instructions below .
• 2 .
Hold the applicator between the thumb and forefinger along the seam on the sides of the bulb .
Shake down vigorously 3 to 4 times ( like a thermometer ) to ensure that the contents are at the thin end of the applicator .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] • 3 .
Hold the applicator by the flat section of the bulb .
Twist off the tab at the thin end and throw away .
DO NOT squeeze the bulb while twisting the tab .
This could force some gel to be released before it is inserted .

What Prochieve ® is Prochieve ® is a specially formulated gel that you insert in your vagina .
It contains the natural female hormone called progesterone .
The 4 % gel is used for women whose menstrual cycle has stopped .
The 8 % gel is to be used when the 4 % gel has not worked .
Understanding the role of Prochieve ® in the treatment of your menstrual irregularities Progesterone is one of the hormones essential for regular menstrual periods .
If your doctor has determined your body does not produce enough progesterone on its own , Prochieve ® may be prescribed to provide the progesterone you need .
When you do not produce enough progesterone , menstrual irregularities can occur .
Prochieve ® can provide you with the progesterone needed during a normal menstrual cycle .
When you should not use Prochieve ® • If you are allergic to progesterone , progesterone - like drugs , or any of the inactive ingredients in the gel ( ask a pharmacist if you are not sure about the inactive ingredients in Prochieve ® ) .
• If you have unusual vaginal bleeding which has not been evaluated by a doctor .
• If you have a liver disease .
• If you have known or suspected cancer of the breast or genital organs .

These problems may include a stroke ( by cutting off blood to part of the brain ) , a heart attack ( by cutting off blood to part of the heart ) , a pulmonary embolus ( by cutting off blood to part of the lungs ) , or other problems .
Any of these conditions may cause death or serious long - term disability .

How to use Prochieve ® The dosage is one application of the 4 % gel ( 45 mg of progesterone ) , vaginally , every other day as directed by your doctor , for a total of six doses .
In some cases , your doctor may prescribe the 8 % gel ( 90 mg of progesterone ) every other day , for a total of six doses .
It is important to note that a dosage increase from the 4 % gel can only be accomplished by using the 8 % gel .
Increasing the volume of gel administered does not increase the amount of progesterone absorbed .
Prochieve ® is to be applied directly from the specially designed sealed applicator into the vagina .
The applicator is designed to deliver a premeasured dose of Prochieve ® .
A small amount of gel will be left in the tube after usage .
Do not be concerned because you will still be receiving the appropriate , measured dosage .
Under certain rare circumstances , such as high altitude , brief exposure to high temperature , sudden changes in atmospheric / barometric pressure , and pressure controlled environments such as airplanes or high - rise buildings , the internal pressure of the applicator may become higher than the air pressure .
This imbalance between the internal and external pressure may cause the gel to expel from the applicator when the twist - off tab is removed .
If you should experience the gel expelling from the applicator upon opening , please follow the SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AT ALTITUDES ABOVE 2500 FEET .
• 1 .
Remove the applicator from the sealed wrapper .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AT ALTITUDES ABOVE 2500 FEET • Remove the applicator from the sealed wrapper .
DO NOT remove the twist - off tab at this time .
Hold the applicator on both sides of the bulb , as shown .
Using a lancet or a stick pin , make a single puncture in the flat part of the bulb .
This will relieve the difference in air pressure between the inside and outside of the applicator caused by high altitudes .
It will not affect the amount of gel administered .
You will still be receiving the appropriate , measured dosage .
