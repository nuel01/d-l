The doses should be taken as close to 12 hours apart as possible ; they should not be taken less than 6 hours apart .
If patients miss a dose , they should take it as soon as possible anytime up to 6 hours prior to their next scheduled dose .
If less than 6 hours remain before the next dose , wait until their next scheduled dose .
2 . 2 Administration Instructions TOBI is administered by oral inhalation over an approximately 15 - minute period , using a hand - held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo - Aide compressor .
TOBI should not be diluted or mixed with dornase alfa or other medications in the nebulizer .
TOBI is not for subcutaneous , intravenous or intrathecal administration .
Prior to administration of TOBI , read the Patient Information / Instructions for Use for TOBI for detailed information on how to use TOBI , and follow the manufacturer ’ s instructions for use and care of the PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer and DeVilbiss Pulmo - Aide air compressor .
TOBI is inhaled while the patient is sitting or standing upright and breathing normally through the mouthpiece of the nebulizer .
Nose clips may help the patient breathe through the mouth .
Instruct patients on multiple therapies to take their medications , prior to inhaling TOBI or as directed by their physician .
TOBI should not be used if it is cloudy , if there are particles in the solution , or if it has been stored at room temperature for more than 28 days .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS TOBI is supplied as a sterile inhalational solution for nebulization in single - dose 5 mL ampoules .
Each 5 mL ampoule contains 300 mg of tobramycin .
Inhalation Solution : 300 mg per 5 mL solution in a single - dose ampoule ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS TOBI is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside .
Known hypersensitivity to any aminoglycoside ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Bronchospasm : Can occur with inhalation of TOBI .
Treat as medically appropriate , if it occurs .
( 5 . 1 ) • • Ototoxicity : Tinnitus and hearing loss have been reported in patients receiving TOBI .
If noted , manage as medically appropriate , including potentially discontinuing TOBI .
( 5 . 2 ) • • Nephrotoxicity : Has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class .
If nephrotoxicity develops , manage the patient as medically appropriate , including potentially discontinuing TOBI .
( 5 . 3 ) • • Neuromuscular Disorders : Aminoglycosides may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare - like effect on neuromuscular function .
If neuromuscular blockade occurs , it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary .
( 5 . 4 ) • • Embryo - fetal Toxicity : Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm ( 5 . 5 , 8 . 1 ) 5 . 1 Bronchospasm Bronchospasm can occur with inhalation of TOBI .
In clinical studies with TOBI , changes in FEV1 measured after the inhaled dose were similar in tobramycin inhalation solution and placebo groups .
Bronchospasm that occurs during the use of TOBI should be treated as medically appropriate .
5 . 2 Ototoxicity Ototoxicity , manifested as both auditory and vestibular toxicity , has been reported with parenteral aminoglycosides .
Transient tinnitus occurred in eight TOBI treated patients versus no placebo patients in the clinical studies .
Tinnitus may be a sentinel symptom of ototoxicity , and therefore the onset of this symptom warrants further clinical investigation .
Ototoxicity , as measured by complaints of hearing loss or by audiometric evaluations , did not occur with TOBI therapy during clinical studies , however in postmarketing experience , patients receiving TOBI have reported hearing loss .
Vestibular toxicity may be manifested by vertigo , ataxia or dizziness .
Patients with known or suspected auditory or vestibular dysfunction should be closely monitored when taking TOBI .
Monitoring might include obtaining audiometric evaluations and serum tobramycin levels .
If ototoxicity is noted , the patient should be managed as medically appropriate , including potentially discontinuing TOBI .
5 . 3 Nephrotoxicity Nephrotoxicity was not seen during clinical studies with TOBI but has been associated with aminoglycosides as a class .
Patients with known or suspected renal dysfunction or taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs along with TOBI should have serum concentrations of tobramycin and laboratory measurements of renal function obtained at the discretion of the treating physician .
If nephrotoxicity develops , the patient should be managed as medically appropriate , including potentially discontinuing TOBI .
5 . 4 Neuromuscular Disorders Aminoglycosides , including tobramycin , may aggravate muscle weakness because of a potential curare - like effect on neuromuscular function .
Neuromuscular blockade , respiratory failure , and prolonged respiratory paralysis may occur more commonly in patients with underlying neuromuscular disorders , such as myasthenia gravis or Parkinson ’ s disease .
Prolonged respiratory paralysis may also occur in patients receiving concomitant neuromuscular blocking agents .
If neuromuscular blockade occurs , it may be reversed by the administration of calcium salts but mechanical assistance may be necessary .
5 . 5 Embryo - fetal Toxicity Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Aminoglycosides cross the placenta , and streptomycin has been associated with several reports of total , irreversible , bilateral congenital deafness in pediatric patients exposed in utero .
However , systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Patients who use TOBI during pregnancy , or become pregnant while taking TOBI should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 6 Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides Patients receiving concomitant TOBI and parenteral aminoglycoside therapy should be monitored as clinically appropriate for toxicities associated with aminoglycosides as a class .
Serum tobramycin levels should be monitored .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described below and elsewhere in the labeling : • • Bronchospasm [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Ototoxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • • Nephrotoxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • • Neuromuscular Disorders [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • • Embryo - fetal Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • • Concomitant Use of Systemic Aminoglycosides [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( incidence > 5 % ) are increased cough , pharyngitis , increased sputum , dyspnea , hemoptysis , decreased lung function , voice alteration , taste perversion and rash .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Mylan at 1 - 877 - 446 - 3679 ( 1 - 877 - 4 - INFO - RX ) or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
TOBI was studied in two Phase 3 clinical studies involving 258 cystic fibrosis patients ranging in age from 6 to 48 years .
Patients received TOBI in alternating periods of 28 days on and 28 days off drug in addition to their standard cystic fibrosis therapy for a total of 24 weeks .
Table 1 lists the percent of patients with selected adverse reactions that occurred in > 5 % of TOBI patients during the two Phase 3 studies .
Table 1 : Percent of Patients With Selected Adverse Reactions Occurring in > 5 % of TOBI PatientsAdverse Reaction Tobramycin Inhalation Solution ( n = 258 ) % Placebo ( n = 262 ) % Cough Increased 46 . 1 47 . 3 Pharyngitis 38 . 0 39 . 3 Sputum Increased 37 . 6 39 . 7 Dyspnea 33 . 7 38 . 5 Hemoptysis 19 . 4 23 . 7 Lung Function Decreased [ 1 ] 16 . 3 15 . 3 Voice Alteration 12 . 8 6 . 5 Taste Perversion 6 . 6 6 . 9 Rash 5 . 4 6 . 1 [ 1 ] Includes reported decreases in pulmonary function tests or decreased lung volume on chest radiograph associated with intercurrent illness or study drug administration .
Selected adverse reactions that occurred in less than or equal to 5 % of patients treated with TOBI : Ear and Labyrinth Disorders : Tinnitus Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : Myalgia Infections and Infestations : Laryngitis Voice Alteration and Tinnitus Voice alteration and tinnitus were the only adverse reactions reported by significantly more TOBI - treated patients .
Thirty - three patients ( 13 % ) treated with TOBI complained of voice alteration compared to 17 ( 7 % ) placebo patients .
Voice alteration was more common in the on - drug periods .
Eight patients from the TOBI group ( 3 % ) reported tinnitus compared to no placebo patients .
All episodes were transient , resolved without discontinuation of the TOBI treatment regimen , and were not associated with loss of hearing in audiograms .
Tinnitus is one of the sentinel symptoms of cochlear toxicity , and patients with this symptom should be carefully monitored for high frequency hearing loss .
The numbers of patients reporting vestibular adverse experiences such as dizziness were similar in the TOBI and placebo groups .
Changes in Serum Creatinine Nine ( 3 % ) patients in the TOBI group and nine ( 3 % ) patients in the placebo group had increases in serum creatinine of at least 50 % over baseline .
In all nine patients in the TOBI group , creatinine decreased at the next visit .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of TOBI .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Ear and Labyrinth Disorders Hearing loss : Some of these reports occurred in patients with previous or concomitant treatment with systemic aminoglycosides .
Patients with hearing loss frequently reported tinnitus [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Hypersensitivity , pruritus , urticaria , rash Nervous System Disorders Aphonia , dysgeusia Respiratory , Thoracic , and Mediastinal Disorders Bronchospasm [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] oropharyngeal pain Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders Decreased appetite 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • • Concurrent and / or sequential use of TOBI with other drugs with neurotoxic , nephrotoxic , or ototoxic potential should be avoided .
( 7 . 1 ) • • Concomitant administration with ethacrynic acid , furosemide , urea , or intravenous mannitol is not recommended due to possible enhancement of aminoglycoside toxicity .
( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Drugs with Neurotoxic , Nephrotoxic or Ototoxic Potential Concurrent and / or sequential use of TOBI with other drugs with neurotoxic , nephrotoxic , or ototoxic potential should be avoided .
7 . 2 Diuretics Some diuretics can enhance aminoglycoside toxicity by altering aminoglycoside concentrations in serum and tissue .
TOBI should not be administered concomitantly with ethacrynic acid , furosemide , urea , or intravenous mannitol .
The interaction between inhaled mannitol and TOBI has not been evaluated .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Aminoglycosides can cause fetal harm .
Published literature reports that use of streptomycin , an aminoglycoside , can cause total , irreversible , bilateral congenital deafness when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Although there are no available data on TOBI use in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes , systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
There are risks to the mother associated with cystic fibrosis in pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
In animal reproduction studies with subcutaneous administration of tobramycin in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis , there were no adverse developmental outcomes ; however , ototoxicity was not evaluated in the offspring from these studies ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - Associated Maternal and / or Embryo / Fetal Risk Cystic fibrosis may increase the risk for preterm delivery .
Data Animal Data No reproductive toxicity studies have been conducted with TOBI ( tobramycin administered by inhalation ) .
However , subcutaneous administration of tobramycin at doses of up to 100 ( rat ) or 20 ( rabbit ) mg / kg / day during organogenesis was not associated with adverse developmental outcomes .
Doses of tobramycin ≥ 40 mg / kg / day were severely maternally toxic to rabbits and precluded the evaluation of adverse developmental outcomes .
Ototoxicity was not evaluated in offspring during non - clinical reproductive toxicity studies with tobramycin .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of TOBI in either human or animal milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Limited published data on other formulations of tobramycin in lactating women indicate that tobramycin is present in human milk .
However , systemic absorption of tobramycin following inhaled administration is expected to be minimal [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Tobramycin may cause alteration in the intestinal flora of the breastfeeding infant ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for TOBI and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from TOBI or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations Tobramycin may cause intestinal flora alteration .
Advise a woman to monitor the breastfed infant for loose or bloody stools and candidiasis ( thrush , diaper rash ) .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of TOBI in pediatric patients under 6 years of age has not been established .
The use of TOBI is not indicated in children < 6 years of age [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of TOBI did not include patients aged 65 years and over .
Tobramycin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , it may be useful to monitor renal function [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Signs and symptoms of acute toxicity from overdosage of intravenous ( IV ) tobramycin might include dizziness , tinnitus , vertigo , loss of high - tone hearing acuity , respiratory failure , neuromuscular blockade , and renal impairment .
Administration by inhalation results in low systemic bioavailability of tobramycin .
Tobramycin is not significantly absorbed following oral administration .
Tobramycin serum concentrations may be helpful in monitoring overdosage .
Acute toxicity should be treated with immediate withdrawal of TOBI , and baseline tests of renal function should be undertaken .
In all cases of suspected overdosage , physicians should contact the Regional Poison Control Center for information about effective treatment .
In the case of any overdosage , the possibility of drug interactions with alterations in drug disposition should be considered .
Hemodialysis may be helpful in removing tobramycin from the body .
11 DESCRIPTION TOBI ® is a tobramycin solution for inhalation .
It is a sterile , clear , slightly yellow , non - pyrogenic , aqueous solution with the pH and salinity adjusted specifically for administration by a compressed air driven reusable nebulizer .
The chemical formula for tobramycin is C18H37N5O9 and the molecular weight is 467 . 52 g / mol .
Tobramycin is O - 3 - amino - 3 - deoxy - α - D ‑ glucopyranosyl - ( 1 → 4 ) - O - [ 2 , 6 - diamino - 2 , 3 , 6 - trideoxy - α - D - ribo - hexopyranosyl - ( 1 → 6 ) ] - 2 - deoxy - L - streptamine .
The structural formula for tobramycin is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Each single - dose 5 mL ampoule contains 300 mg tobramycin and 11 . 25 mg sodium chloride in sterile water for injection .
Sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide are added to adjust the pH to 6 . 0 .
Nitrogen is used for sparging .
All ingredients meet USP requirements .
The formulation contains no preservatives .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption TOBI contains tobramycin , a cationic polar molecule that does not readily cross epithelial membranes .
( 1 ) The bioavailability of TOBI may vary because of individual differences in nebulizer performance and airway pathology .
( 2 ) Following administration of TOBI , tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways .
Serum Concentrations The average serum concentration of tobramycin one hour after inhalation of a single 300 - mg dose of TOBI by cystic fibrosis patients was 0 . 95 mcg / mL .
After 20 weeks of therapy on the TOBI regimen , the average serum tobramycin concentration one hour after dosing was 1 . 05 mcg / mL .
Sputum Concentrations Ten minutes after inhalation of the first 300 - mg dose of TOBI by cystic fibrosis patients , the average concentration of tobramycin was 1237 mcg / g ( range 35 to 7417 mcg / g ) in sputum .
Tobramycin does not accumulate in sputum ; after 20 weeks of therapy with the TOBI regimen , the average concentration of tobramycin at ten minutes after inhalation was 1154 mcg / g ( range 39 to 8085 mcg / g ) in sputum .
Two hours after inhalation , sputum concentrations declined to approximately 14 % of tobramycin levels at ten minutes after inhalation .
Distribution Following administration of TOBI , tobramycin remains concentrated primarily in the airways .
Binding of tobramycin to serum proteins is negligible .
Elimination Metabolism Tobramycin is not metabolized .
Excretion The elimination half - life of tobramycin from serum is approximately 2 and 3 hours after intravenous ( IV ) administration and inhalation , respectively .
Systemically absorbed tobramycin is primarily excreted unchanged in the urine principally by glomerular filtration .
Unabsorbed tobramycin , following TOBI administration , is probably eliminated primarily in expectorated sputum .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibacterial produced by Streptomyces tenebrarius .
( 1 ) It acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis , leading to altered cell membrane permeability , progressive disruption of the cell envelope , and eventual cell death .
( 3 ) Tobramycin has in vitro activity against gram - negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
It is bactericidal in vitro at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) .
Resistance Treatment for 6 months with TOBI in two clinical studies did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P . aeruginosa isolates tested ; however , increased minimum inhibitory concentrations ( MICs ) were noted in some patients .
The clinical significance of this information has not been clearly established in the treatment of P . aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Susceptibility Test Methods Interpretive criteria for inhaled antibacterial products are not defined .
The in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test methods used for parenteral tobramycin therapy can be used to monitor the susceptibility of P . aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patients .
If decreased susceptibility is noted , the results should be reported to the clinician .
Susceptibility breakpoints established for parenteral administration of tobramycin do not apply to aerosolized administration of TOBI .
The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with TOBI therapy is not clear .
A single sputum sample from a cystic fibrosis patient may contain multiple morphotypes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and each morphotype may have a different level of in vitro susceptibility to tobramycin .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility A two - year rat inhalation toxicology study to assess carcinogenic potential of TOBI has been completed .
Rats were exposed to TOBI for up to 1 . 5 hours per day for 95 weeks .
The clinical formulation of the drug was used for this carcinogenicity study .
Serum levels of tobramycin of up to 35 mcg / mL were measured in rats , in contrast to the average 1 mcg / mL levels observed in cystic fibrosis patients in clinical trials .
There was no drug - related increase in the incidence of any variety of tumor .
Additionally , tobramycin has been evaluated for genotoxicity in a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests .
The Ames bacterial reversion test , conducted with 5 tester strains , failed to show a significant increase in revertants with or without metabolic activation in all strains .
Tobramycin was negative in the mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay , did not induce chromosomal aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells , and was negative in the mouse micronucleus test .
Subcutaneous administration of up to 100 mg / kg of tobramycin did not affect mating behavior or cause impairment of fertility in male or female rats .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two identically designed , double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled , parallel group , 24 - week clinical studies ( Study 1 and Study 2 ) at a total of 69 cystic fibrosis centers in the United States were conducted in cystic fibrosis patients with P . aeruginosa .
Subjects who were less than 6 years of age , had a baseline creatinine of > 2 mg / dL , or had Burkholderia cepacia isolated from sputum were excluded .
All subjects had baseline FEV1 % predicted between 25 % and 75 % .
In these clinical studies , 258 patients received TOBI therapy on an outpatient basis ( see Table 2 ) using a hand - held PARI LC PLUS Reusable Nebulizer with a DeVilbiss Pulmo - Aide compressor .
Table 2 : Dosing Regimens in Clinical Studies Cycle 1 Cycle 2 Cycle 3 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days TOBI TOBI No drug TOBI No drug TOBI No drug regimen 300 mg 300 mg 300 mg n = 258 twice daily twice daily twice daily Placebo placebo No drug placebo No drug placebo No drug regimen twice daily twice daily twice daily n = 262 All patients received either TOBI or placebo ( saline with 1 . 25 mg quinine for flavoring ) in addition to standard treatment recommended for cystic fibrosis patients , which included oral and parenteral antipseudomonal therapy , β2 - agonists , cromolyn , inhaled steroids , and airway clearance techniques .
In addition , approximately 77 % of patients were concurrently treated with dornase alfa ( PULMOZYME , Genentech ) .
In each study , TOBI - treated patients experienced significant improvement in pulmonary function .
Improvement was demonstrated in the TOBI group in Study 1 by an average increase in FEV1 % predicted of about 11 % relative to baseline ( Week 0 ) during 24 weeks compared to no average change in placebo patients .
In Study 2 , TOBI - treated patients had an average increase of about 7 % compared to an average decrease of about 1 % in placebo patients .
Figure 1 shows the average relative change in FEV1 % predicted over 24 weeks for both studies .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] In each study , TOBI therapy resulted in a significant reduction in the number of P . aeruginosa colony forming units ( CFUs ) in sputum during the on - drug periods .
Sputum bacterial density returned to baseline during the off - drug periods .
Reductions in sputum bacterial density were smaller in each successive cycle ( see Figure 2 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Patients treated with TOBI were hospitalized for an average of 5 . 1 days compared to 8 . 1 days for placebo patients .
Patients treated with TOBI required an average of 9 . 6 days of parenteral antipseudomonal , antibacterial treatment compared to 14 . 1 days for placebo patients .
During the 6 months of treatment , 40 % of TOBI patients and 53 % of placebo patients were treated with parenteral antipseudomonal antibacterials .
The relationship between in vitro susceptibility test results and clinical outcome with TOBI therapy is not clear .
However , four TOBI patients who began the clinical trial with P . aeruginosa isolates having MIC values ≥ 128 mcg / mL did not experience an improvement in FEV1 or a decrease in sputum bacterial density .
Treatment with TOBI did not affect the susceptibility of the majority of P . aeruginosa isolates during the 6 - month studies .
However , some P . aeruginosa isolates did exhibit increased tobramycin MICs .
The percentage of patients with P . aeruginosa isolates with tobramycin MICs ≥ 16 mcg / mL was 13 % at the beginning , and 23 % at the end of 6 months of the TOBI regimen .
