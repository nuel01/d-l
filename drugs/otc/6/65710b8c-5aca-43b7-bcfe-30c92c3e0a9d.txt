WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Pigmentation : Pigmentation of the iris , periorbital tissue ( eyelid ) and eyelashes can occur .
Iris pigmentation likely to be permanent .
( 5 . 1 ) • • Eyelash Changes : Gradual change to eyelashes including increased length , thickness and number of lashes .
Usually reversible .
( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Pigmentation ROCKLATAN contains latanoprost which has been reported to cause changes to pigmented tissues .
The most frequently reported changes have been increased pigmentation of the iris , periorbital tissue ( eyelid ) , and eyelashes .
Pigmentation is expected to increase as long as latanoprost is administered .
The pigmentation change is due to increased melanin content in the melanocytes rather than to an increase in the number of melanocytes .
After discontinuation of latanoprost , pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent , while pigmentation of the periorbital tissue and eyelash changes have been reported to be reversible in some patients .
Patients who receive treatment should be informed of the possibility of increased pigmentation .
Beyond 5 years the effects of increased pigmentation are not known .
Iris color change may not be noticeable for several months to years .
Typically , the brown pigmentation around the pupil spreads concentrically towards the periphery of the iris and the entire iris or parts of the iris become more brownish .
Neither nevi nor freckles of the iris appear to be affected by treatment .
While treatment with ROCKLATAN can be continued in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation , these patients should be examined regularly [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 2 Eyelash Changes ROCKLATAN contains latanoprost which may gradually change eyelashes and vellus hair in the treated eye ; these changes include increased length , thickness , pigmentation , the number of lashes or hairs , and misdirected growth of eyelashes .
Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 3 Intraocular Inflammation ROCKLATAN contains latanoprost which should be used with caution in patients with a history of intraocular inflammation ( iritis / uveitis ) and should generally not be used in patients with active intraocular inflammation because it may exacerbate inflammation .
5 . 4 Macular Edema Macular edema , including cystoid macular edema , has been reported during treatment with latanoprost .
ROCKLATAN should be used with caution in aphakic patients , in pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule , or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema .
5 . 5 Herpetic Keratitis Reactivation of Herpes Simplex keratitis has been reported during treatment with latanoprost .
ROCKLATAN should be used with caution in patients with a history of herpetic keratitis .
ROCKLATAN should be avoided in cases of active herpes simplex keratitis because it may exacerbate inflammation .
5 . 6 Bacterial Keratitis There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple - dose containers of topical ophthalmic products .
These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who , in most cases , had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 7 Use with Contact Lenses Contact lenses should be removed prior to the administration of ROCKLATAN and may be reinserted 15 minutes after administration .
6 .
ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reaction is conjunctival hyperemia ( 59 % ) .
Other common adverse reactions were : instillation site pain ( 20 % ) , corneal verticillata ( 15 % ) , and conjunctival hemorrhage ( 11 % ) .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
The most common ocular adverse reaction observed in controlled clinical studies with ROCKLATAN was conjunctival hyperemia which was reported in 59 % of patients .
Five percent of patients discontinued therapy due to conjunctival hyperemia .
Other common ocular adverse reactions reported were : instillation site pain ( 20 % ) , corneal verticillata ( 15 % ) , and conjunctival hemorrhage ( 11 % ) .
Eye pruritus , visual acuity reduced , increased lacrimation , instillation site discomfort , and blurred vision were reported in 5 - 8 % of patients .
Other adverse reactions that have been reported with the individual components and not listed above include : • • Netarsudil 0 . 02 % Instillation site erythema , corneal staining , increased lacrimation , and erythema of eyelid .
• • Latanoprost 0 . 005 % Foreign body sensation , punctate keratitis , burning and stinging , itching , increased pigmentation of the iris , excessive tearing , eyelid discomfort , dry eye , eye pain , eyelid margin crusting , erythema of the eyelid , upper respiratory tract infection / nasopharyngitis / influenza , photophobia , eyelid edema , myalgia / arthralgia / back pain , and rash / allergic reactions .
7 .
DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro drug interaction studies have shown that precipitation can occur when eye drops containing thimerosal are mixed with ROCKLATAN .
If such drugs are used , they should be administered at least five ( 5 ) minutes apart .
The combined use of two or more prostaglandins or prostaglandin analogs including latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0 . 005 % is not recommended .
It has been shown that administration of these prostaglandin drug products more than once daily may decrease the IOP lowering effect or cause paradoxical elevations in IOP .
Thimerosal : In vitro studies have shown that precipitation can occur when eye drops containing thimerosal are mixed with ROCKLATAN ® .
If such drugs are used , they should be administered at least 5 minutes apart .

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of ROCKLATAN ophthalmic solution or its pharmacologically active ingredients ( netarsudil and latanoprost ) in pregnant women to inform any drug associated risk .
However , systemic exposure to netarsudil from ocular administration is low [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Reproduction studies of latanoprost showed embryofetal lethality in rabbits .
No embryofetal lethality was observed at a dose approximately 15 times higher than the recommended human ophthalmic dose ( RHOD ) .
Intravenous administration of netarsudil to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis did not produce adverse embryofetal effects at clinically relevant systemic exposures .
ROCKLATAN should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Data Animal Data Netarsudil administered daily by intravenous injection to rats during organogenesis caused abortions and embryofetal lethality at doses ≥ 0 . 3 mg / kg / day ( 126 - fold the plasma exposure at the RHOD , based on Cmax ) .
The no - observed - adverse - effect - level ( NOAEL ) for embryofetal development toxicity was 0 . 1 mg / kg / day ( 40 - fold the plasma exposure at the RHOD , based on Cmax ) .
Netarsudil administered daily by intravenous injection to rabbits during organogenesis caused embryofetal lethality and decreased fetal weight at 5 mg / kg / day ( 1480 - fold the plasma exposure at the RHOD , based on Cmax ) .
Malformations were observed at ≥ 3 mg / kg / day ( 1330 - fold the plasma exposure at the RHOD , based on Cmax ) , including thoracogastroschisis , umbilical hernia and absent intermediate lung lobe .
The NOAEL for embryofetal development toxicity was 0 . 5 mg / kg / day ( 214 - fold the plasma exposure at the RHOD , based on Cmax ) .
Reproduction studies have been performed with latanoprost in rats and rabbits .
In 4 of 16 pregnant rabbits , no viable fetuses were present at a dose that was approximately 80 times higher than the RHOD .
Latanoprost did not produce embryofetal lethality in rabbits at a dose approximately 15 times higher than the RHOD .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of netarsudil or latanoprost in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
However , systemic exposure to netarsudil following topical ocular administration is low , and it is not known whether measurable levels of netarsudil would be present in maternal milk following topical ocular administration .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for ROCKLATAN and any potential adverse effects on the breast - fed child from ROCKLATAN .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and other adult patients .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action ROCKLATAN is comprised of two components : netarsudil and latanoprost .
Each of these two components decreases elevated IOP .
Elevated IOP represents a major risk factor for glaucomatous field loss .
The higher the level of IOP , the greater the likelihood of optic nerve damage and glaucomatous visual field loss .
ROCKLATAN is believed to reduce IOP by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The systemic exposures of netarsudil and its active metabolite , AR - 13503 , were evaluated in 18 healthy subjects after topical ocular administration of netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0 . 02 % once daily ( 1 drop bilaterally in the morning ) for 8 days .
There were no quantifiable plasma concentrations of netarsudil ( lower limit of quantitation ( LLOQ ) 0 . 100 ng / mL ) post dose on Day 1 and Day 8 .
Only 1 plasma concentration at 0 . 11 ng / mL for the active metabolite was observed for 1 subject on Day 8 at 8 hours post - dose .
Distribution The distribution volume in humans is 0 . 16 ± 0 . 02 L / kg .
Latanoprost is absorbed through the cornea where the isopropyl ester prodrug is hydrolyzed to the acid form to become biologically active .
The acid of latanoprost can be measured in aqueous humor during the first 4 hours , and in plasma only during the first hour after local administration .
Metabolism After topical ocular dosing , netarsudil is metabolized by esterases in the eye to an active metabolite , AR - 13503 .
Latanoprost , an isopropyl ester prodrug , is hydrolyzed by esterases in the cornea to the biologically active acid .
The active acid of latanoprost reaching the systemic circulation is primarily metabolized by the liver to the 1 , 2 - dinor and 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 - tetranor metabolites via fatty acid β - oxidation .
Excretion The elimination of the acid of latanoprost from human plasma is rapid ( t ½ = 17 min ) after both intravenous and topical administration .
Systemic clearance is approximately 7 mL / min / kg .
Following hepatic β - oxidation , the metabolites are mainly eliminated via the kidneys .
Approximately 88 % and 98 % of the administered dose are recovered in the urine after topical and intravenous dosing , respectively .
13 .
NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long - term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of netarsudil .
Latanoprost was not carcinogenic in either mice or rats when administered by oral gavage at doses of up to 170 mcg / kg / day ( approximately 2800 times the RHOD ) for up to 20 and 24 months , respectively .
Mutagenesis Netarsudil was not mutagenic in the Ames test , in the mouse lymphoma test , or in the in vivo rat micronucleus test .
Latanoprost was not mutagenic in bacteria , in mouse lymphoma , or in mouse micronucleus tests .
Chromosome aberrations were observed in vitro with human lymphocytes .
Additional in vitro and in vivo studies on unscheduled DNA synthesis in rats were negative .
Impairment of Fertility Studies to evaluate the effects of netarsudil on male or female fertility in animals have not been performed .
Latanoprost has not been found to have effects on male or female fertility in animal studies .

CLINICAL STUDIES ROCKLATAN ( netarsudil and latanoprost ophthalmic solution ) 0 . 02 % / 0 . 005 % was evaluated in 2 randomized and controlled clinical trials , namely PG324 - CS301 ( NCT 02558400 , referred to as Study 301 ) and PG324 - CS302 ( NCT 02674854 , referred to as Study 302 ) in patients with open - angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension .
Studies 301 and 302 enrolled subjects with IOP < 36 mmHg and compared IOP lowering effect of ROCKLATAN dosed once daily to individually administered netarsudil 0 . 02 % once daily and latanoprost 0 . 005 % once daily .
The treatment duration was 12 months for Study 301 and 3 months for Study 302 .
The average IOP lowering effect of ROCKLATAN was 1 to 3 mmHg greater than monotherapy with either netarsudil 0 . 02 % or latanoprost 0 . 005 % throughout 3 months ( Figures 1 and 2 ) .
In Study 301 IOP reductions were maintained throughout 12 months .
