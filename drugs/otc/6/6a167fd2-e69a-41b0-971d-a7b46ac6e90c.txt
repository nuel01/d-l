( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Blood Donation : Advise patients not to donate blood or blood products during treatment with DAURISMO and for at least 30 days after the last dose .
( 5 . 1 ) • QTc Interval Prolongation : Monitor electrocardiograms and electrolytes .
If QTc prolongation occurs , interrupt treatment with DAURISMO .
( 2 . 2 , 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal embryo - fetal developmental toxicity studies , DAURISMO can cause embryo - fetal death or severe birth defects when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no clinical data on the use of DAURISMO in pregnant women .
In animal embryo - fetal developmental toxicity studies , glasdegib caused embryotoxicity , fetotoxicity and teratogenicity at maternal exposures that were less than the human exposure at the recommended human dose of 100 mg [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus .
Females of Reproductive Potential DAURISMO is not recommended for use during pregnancy .
Conduct pregnancy testing in female patients of reproductive potential prior to initiating DAURISMO treatment .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DAURISMO and for at least 30 days after the last dose .
Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with DAURISMO and for at least 30 days after the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 2 , 8 . 3 ) ] .
Males Advise male patients with female partners of the potential risk of exposure through semen and to use effective contraception , including a condom , even after vasectomy , to avoid drug exposure to a pregnant partner or a female partner of reproductive potential during treatment with DAURISMO and for at least 30 days after the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
Blood Donation Advise patients not to donate blood or blood products while taking DAURISMO and for at least 30 days after the last dose of DAURISMO because their blood or blood products might be given to a female of reproductive potential .
5 . 2 QTc Interval Prolongation Patients treated with DAURISMO can develop QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias , including ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia .
Of the 98 evaluable patients treated with DAURISMO 100 mg in combination with low - dose cytarabine in the clinical trial , 5 % were found to have a QTc interval greater than 500 ms and 4 % of patients had an increase from baseline QTc greater than 60 ms . The clinical trial excluded patients with baseline QTc of greater than 470 ms or with a history of long QT syndrome or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease .
Monitor electrocardiograms ( ECGs ) and electrolytes [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Concomitant use of DAURISMO with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval and CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the risk of QTc interval prolongation [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
In patients with congenital long QT syndrome , congestive heart failure , electrolyte abnormalities , or those who are taking medications known to prolong the QTc interval , more frequent ECG monitoring is recommended .
Interrupt DAURISMO if QTc increases to greater than 500 ms . Discontinue DAURISMO permanently for patients who develop QTc interval prolongation with signs or symptoms of life - threatening arrhythmia [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .

( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise women not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animal embryo - fetal developmental toxicity studies , DAURISMO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no clinical data on the use of DAURISMO in pregnant women to inform of a drug - associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage .
DAURISMO is not recommended for use during pregnancy .
Conduct pregnancy testing in female patients of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with DAURISMO .
Report pregnancy exposures to Pfizer at 1 - 800 - 438 - 1985 .
In animal embryo - fetal developmental toxicity studies , repeat - dose oral administration of DAURISMO during organogenesis at maternal exposures that were less than the human exposure at the recommended dose resulted in embryotoxicity , fetotoxicity and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown .
Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In embryo - fetal developmental toxicity studies , glasdegib was orally administered to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to 100 mg / kg / day during the period of organogenesis .
Glasdegib resulted in embryo - fetal lethality ( e . g . , increased postimplantation loss and decreased numbers of live fetuses ) in rats and rabbits at 50 mg / kg / day and 5 mg / kg / day , respectively , at maternal exposures approximately 4 - times and 3 - times the human exposure at the recommended dose [ based on Cmax ( rat ) and AUC ( rabbit ) ] .
Doses of ≥ 10 mg / kg in rat [ approximately 0 . 6 - times the human exposure ( Cmax ) at the recommended dose ] and ≥ 5 mg / kg in rabbit resulted in fetal developmental abnormalities and malformations consisting of craniofacial malformations , malformed limbs , paws / digits , trunk and tail , dilation of brain , malpositioned / malformed eyes , misshapen head , small tongue , absent palate , teeth and viscera , diaphragmatic hernia , edema , heart defects , rib and vertebral abnormalities , malformed or absent structures in the appendicular skeleton .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of glasdegib or its active metabolites in human milk , the effects of the drug on the breastfed child , or its effect on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from DAURISMO , advise women who are taking DAURISMO not to breastfeed or provide breast milk to infants or children during treatment with DAURISMO and for at least 30 days after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential DAURISMO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing in females of reproductive potential within 7 days prior to initiating therapy with DAURISMO .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with DAURISMO and at least 30 days after the last dose .
Males It is not known if glasdegib is present in semen .
Advise males of the potential risk of exposure through semen and to use effective contraception , including a condom , even after a vasectomy , to avoid drug exposure to a pregnant partner or a female partner of reproductive potential during treatment with DAURISMO and for at least 30 days after the last dose .
Advise males to not donate semen during treatment with DAURISMO for at least 30 days after the last dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Males Based on findings in repeat - dose animal toxicity studies in rats , DAURISMO may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential .
Some effects on male reproductive organs did not recover [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Men should seek advice on effective fertility preservation before treatment .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of DAURISMO have not been established in pediatric patients .
In repeat - dose toxicity studies in rats , oral administration of DAURISMO resulted in adverse changes in growing bone , teeth , and testis .
Effects on bone consisted of partial to complete closure of the epiphyseal plate .
Effects in growing incisor teeth included degeneration / necrosis of ameloblasts , and complete tooth loss with oral ulceration .
Reproductive tissue toxicity was evidenced by testicular degeneration and hypospermatogenesis .
These effects in bone , teeth and testis were observed after administration of DAURISMO for 26 weeks at greater than or equal to 50 mg / kg / day corresponding to approximately 6 . 6 - times the steady state AUC in patients at the recommended human dose .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of DAURISMO with low - dose cytarabine ( N = 88 ) , 98 % of the patients were age 65 years or older and 60 % of the patients were age 75 years or older .
There were insufficient patients younger than age 65 years to determine differences in adverse reactions reported from patients older than 65 .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dosage modification is recommended for patients with mild to severe renal impairment ( estimated glomerular filtration rate [ eGFR ] 15 to 89 mL / min ) .
Monitor patients with severe renal impairment ( eGFR 15 to 29 mL / min ) for increased risk of adverse reactions , including QTc interval prolongation , due to increased glasdegib concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no specific antidote for DAURISMO .
Management of DAURISMO overdose should include symptomatic treatment and ECG monitoring .
Glasdegib has been administered in clinical studies up to a dose of 640 mg / day .
At the highest dosage , the adverse reactions that were dose limiting were nausea , vomiting , dehydration , hypotension , fatigue , and dizziness .
11 DESCRIPTION DAURISMO ( glasdegib ) is a potent small molecule inhibitor of Smoothened ( SMO ) for oral use .
It is formulated with the maleate salt of glasdegib .
The molecular formula for glasdegib maleate is C25H26N6O5 .
The molecular weight for glasdegib maleate is 490 . 51 Daltons .
The chemical name of glasdegib maleate is 1 - ( ( 2 R , 4 R ) - 2 - ( 1 H - benzo [ d ] imidazol - 2 - yl ) - 1 - methylpiperidin - 4 - yl ) - 3 - ( 4 - cyanophenyl ) urea maleate .
The molecular structure is shown below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Glasdegib maleate is a white to pale colored powder with pKa values of 1 . 7 and 6 . 1 .
The aqueous solubility of glasdegib maleate is 1 . 7 mg / mL .
DAURISMO ( glasdegib ) is supplied as a film - coated tablet for oral use containing either 100 mg glasdegib ( equivalent to 131 . 1 mg glasdegib maleate ) or 25 mg of glasdegib ( equivalent to 32 . 8 mg glasdegib maleate ) together with microcrystalline cellulose , dibasic calcium phosphate anhydrous , sodium starch glycolate , and magnesium stearate as inactive ingredients in the tablet .
The film - coating consists of Opadry II ® Beige ( 33G170003 ) and Opadry II ® Yellow ( 33G120011 ) containing : hypromellose , titanium dioxide , lactose monohydrate , macrogol , triacetin , iron oxide yellow , and iron oxide red .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Glasdegib is an inhibitor of the Hedgehog pathway .
Glasdegib binds to and inhibits Smoothened , a transmembrane protein involved in hedgehog signal transduction .
In a murine xenotransplant model of human AML , glasdegib in combination with low - dose cytarabine , inhibited increases in tumor size and reduced the percentage of CD45 + / CD33 + blasts in the marrow to a greater extent than glasdegib or low - dose cytarabine alone .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of glasdegib administration on corrected QT interval ( QTc ) was evaluated in a randomized , single - dose , double - blind , 4 - way crossover , placebo - and open - label moxifloxacin - controlled study in 36 healthy subjects .
At therapeutic plasma concentrations for the recommended dose , achieved with a single dose of 150 mg DAURISMO , the largest placebo and baseline - adjusted QTc interval change was 8 ms ( 90 % CI : 6 , 10 ms ) .
At a two - fold therapeutic plasma concentration , achieved with a single dose of 300 mg DAURISMO , the QTc change was 13 ms ( 90 % CI : 11 , 16 ms ) .
Glasdegib is associated with concentration - dependent QTc prolongation .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics DAURISMO at 5 mg to 600 mg once daily ( 0 . 05 to 6 times the recommended dose ) result in a dose proportional increase in glasdegib peak concentrations ( Cmax ) and area under the curve over the dosing interval ( AUC0 - Tau ) .
Steady - state plasma levels are reached by 8 days of daily dosing .
The median accumulation ratio of glasdegib ranged from 1 . 2 to 2 . 5 following once - daily dosing .
At DAURISMO 100 mg once daily , the geometric mean ( geometric coefficient of variation , % CV ) of glasdegib Cmax was 1252 ng / mL ( 44 % ) and AUC0 - Tau was 17210 ng * hr / mL ( 54 % ) in patients with cancer .
Absorption The mean absolute bioavailability of DAURISMO is 77 % .
Following 100 mg once daily dosing , glasdegib median time to peak concentrations ( Tmax ) at steady - state ranged from 1 . 3 hours to 1 . 8 hours .
Effect of Food : A high - fat , high - calorie meal ( total 800 – 1000 calories : 500 – 600 fat calories , 250 carbohydrate calories and 150 protein calories ) reduced area under the curve over time to infinity ( AUC0 - INF ) by 16 % and Cmax by 31 % .
Distribution Glasdegib is 91 % bound to human plasma proteins in vitro .
The geometric mean ( % CV ) apparent volume of distribution ( Vz / F ) was 188 L ( 20 % ) in patients with hematologic malignancies .
Elimination Glasdegib has a mean ( ± SD ) half - life of 17 . 4 h ( 3 . 7 ) and geometric mean ( % CV ) apparent clearance of 6 . 45 L / h ( 25 % ) following 100 mg once daily dosing in patients with hematologic malignancies .
Metabolism Glasdegib is primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4 pathway , with minor contributions by CYP2C8 and UGT1A9 .
Glasdegib accounts for 69 % of the total circulating drug related material in plasma .
Excretion Following a single oral dose of 100 mg radiolabeled glasdegib , 49 % ( 17 % unchanged ) of the administered dose was eliminated in the urine and 42 % ( 20 % unchanged ) of the administered dose was eliminated in the feces .
Specific Populations Age ( 25 to 92 years ) , sex , race ( White , Black , Asian ) , body weight ( 43 . 5 to 145 . 6 kg ) , mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin 1 – 1 . 5 × ULN and any AST ) , and mild renal impairment ( creatinine clearance 60 – 89 mL / min ) did not have clinically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of glasdegib .
Patients with Renal Impairment Following administration of a single dose of DAURISMO 100 mg , glasdegib AUC0 - INF increased by 2 . 1 - fold in subjects with moderate ( eGFR 30 to 59 mL / min ) and severe ( eGFR 15 to 29 mL / min ) renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function ( eGFR ≥ 90 mL / min ) .
The pharmacokinetics of glasdegib have not been studied in patients with end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following administration of a single dose of DAURISMO 100 mg , glasdegib AUC0 - INF increased by 11 % in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh B ) and decreased by 24 % in subjects with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) compared to subjects with normal hepatic function .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Model - Informed Approaches Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors on Glasdegib : Co - administration of ketoconazole ( a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 ) with DAURISMO increased the glasdegib AUC0 - INF by 2 . 4 - fold and Cmax by 1 . 4 - fold over glasdegib given alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Effect of Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers on Glasdegib : Co - administration of rifampin ( a strong inducer of CYP3A4 ) with DAURISMO decreased glasdegib AUC0 - INF by 70 % and Cmax by 35 % [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Co - administration of efavirenz ( moderate CYP3A4 inducer ) is predicted to decrease glasdegib AUC0 - INF by 55 % and Cmax by 25 % .
Effect of Gastric Acid Reducing Agents on Glasdegib : Co - administration of rabeprazole ( a proton pump inhibitor ) with DAURISMO did not alter glasdegib AUC0 - INF but decreased Cmax by 20 % .
In Vitro Studies Effect of Glasdegib on Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) Substrates : Glasdegib does not inhibit CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , or CYP3A , and does not induce CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , and CYP3A in vitro .
Effect of Transporters on Glasdegib : Glasdegib is a substrate of P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) and breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) .
Effect of Glasdegib on Transporters : Glasdegib inhibits P - gp , BCRP , multidrug and toxin extrusion ( MATE ) protein 1 , and MATE - 2 K , but not organic anion transporting polypeptide ( OATP ) 1B1 , OATP1B3 , organic anion transporter ( OAT ) 1 , OAT3 , and organic cation transporter ( OCT ) 2 in vitro .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with glasdegib .
Glasdegib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay and was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosome aberration assay in human lymphocytes .
Glasdegib was not clastogenic or aneugenic in the rat micronucleus assay .
Based on nonclinical safety findings , glasdegib has the potential to impair reproductive function in males .
Men should seek advice on effective fertility preservation before treatment .
In repeat - dose toxicity studies in rats , findings observed in the male reproductive tract included adverse testicular changes with glasdegib at doses ≥ 50 mg / kg / day , and consisted of minimal to severe hypospermatogenesis characterized by partial to complete loss of spermatogonia , spermatocytes and spermatids and testicular degeneration .
Hypospermatogenesis did not recover whereas testicular degeneration did recover .
The dose at which testicular effects were observed in male rats was identified as 50 mg / kg / day with corresponding systemic exposures that were approximately 6 . 6 - times ( based on AUC ) those associated with the observed human exposure at the 100 mg once daily dose .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of DAURISMO in combination with low - dose cytarabine was evaluated in a multicenter , open - label , randomized study ( Study BRIGHT AML 1003 , NCT01546038 ) that included 115 patients age 55 years or older with newly - diagnosed AML who met at least one of the following criteria : a ) age ≥ 75 years , b ) severe cardiac disease , c ) baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status of 2 , or d ) baseline serum creatinine > 1 . 3 mg / dL .
Patients were randomized 2 : 1 to receive DAURISMO at a 100 mg daily dose with low - dose cytarabine 20 mg subcutaneously twice daily on days 1 to 10 of a 28 - day cycle ( N = 77 ) or low - dose cytarabine alone ( N = 38 ) in 28 - day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Patients were stratified by cytogenetic risk ( good / intermediate or poor ) .
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics are shown in Table 6 .
The two treatment arms were generally balanced with respect to the baseline demographics and disease characteristics ( see Table 6 ) .
