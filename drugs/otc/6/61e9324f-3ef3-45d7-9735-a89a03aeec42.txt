Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) 05 / 2012 Warnings and Precautions , Hypersensitivity Reaction ( 5 . 1 ) 05 / 2012 Warnings and Precautions , Immune Reconstitution Syndrome ( 5 . 3 ) 11 / 2011 WARNING : RISK OF HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS , LACTIC ACIDOSIS , AND SEVERE HEPATOMEGALY Hypersensitivity Reactions : Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with abacavir ( abacavir sulfate ) .
Hypersensitivity to abacavir is a multi - organ clinical syndrome usually characterized by a sign or symptom in two or more of the following groups : ( 1 ) fever , ( 2 ) rash , ( 3 ) gastrointestinal ( including nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or abdominal pain ) , ( 4 ) constitutional ( including generalized malaise , fatigue , or achiness ) , and ( 5 ) respiratory ( including dyspnea , cough , or pharyngitis ) .
Discontinue abacavir as soon as a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected .
Patients who carry the HLA - B * 5701 allele are at high risk for experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir .
Prior to initiating therapy with abacavir , screening for the HLA - B * 5701 allele is recommended ; this approach has been found to decrease the risk of hypersensitivity reaction .
Screening is also recommended prior to reinitiation of abacavir in patients of unknown HLA - B * 5701 status who have previously tolerated abacavir .
HLA - B * 5701 - negative patients may develop a suspected hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir ; however , this occurs significantly less frequently than in HLA - B * 5701 - positive patients .
Regardless of HLA - B * 5701 status , permanently discontinue abacavir if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out , even when other diagnoses are possible .
Following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir , NEVER restart abacavir tablets or any other abacavir - containing product because more severe symptoms can occur within hours and may include life threatening hypotension and death .
Reintroduction of abacavir tablets or any other abacavir - containing product , even in patients who have no identified history or unrecognized symptoms of hypersensitivity to abacavir therapy , can result in serious or fatal hypersensitivity reactions .
Such reactions can occur within hours [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly : Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis , including fatal cases , have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination , including abacavir and other antiretrovirals [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .

( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reaction Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with abacavir tablets and other abacavir - containing products .
Patients who carry the HLA - B * 5701 allele are at high risk for experiencing a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir .
Prior to initiating therapy with abacavir , screening for the HLA - B * 5701 allele is recommended ; this approach has been found to decrease the risk of a hypersensitivity reaction .
Screening is also recommended prior to reinitiation of abacavir in patients of unknown HLA - B * 5701 status who have previously tolerated abacavir .
For HLA - B * 5701 - positive patients , treatment with an abacavir - containing regimen is not recommended and should be considered only with close medical supervision and under exceptional circumstances when the potential benefit outweighs the risk .
HLA - B * 5701 - negative patients may develop a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir ; however , this occurs significantly less frequently than in HLA - B * 5701 - positive patients .
Regardless of HLA - B * 5701 status , permanently discontinue abacavir if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out , even when other diagnoses are possible .
Important information on signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity , as well as clinical management , is presented below .
Signs and Symptoms of Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity to abacavir is a multi - organ clinical syndrome usually characterized by a sign or symptom in two or more of the following groups .
Group 1 : Fever Group 2 : Rash Group 3 : Gastrointestinal ( including nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or abdominal pain ) Group 4 : Constitutional ( including generalized malaise , fatigue , or achiness ) Group 5 : Respiratory ( including dyspnea , cough , or pharyngitis ) .
Hypersensitivity to abacavir following the presentation of a single sign or symptom has been reported infrequently .
Hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported in approximately 8 % of 2 , 670 subjects ( n = 206 ) in nine clinical trials ( range : 2 % to 9 % ) with enrollment from November 1999 to February 2002 .
Data on time to onset and symptoms of suspected hypersensitivity were collected on a detailed data collection module .
The frequencies of symptoms are shown in Figure 1 .
Symptoms usually appeared within the first 6 weeks of treatment with abacavir , although the reaction may occur at any time during therapy .
Median time to onset was 9 days ; 89 % appeared within the first 6 weeks ; 95 % of subjects reported symptoms from two or more of the five groups listed above .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Other less common signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity include lethargy , myolysis , edema , abnormal chest x - ray findings ( predominantly infiltrates , which can be localized ) , and paresthesia .
Anaphylaxis , liver failure , renal failure , hypotension , adult respiratory distress syndrome , respiratory failure , and death have occurred in association with hypersensitivity reactions .
In one trial , four subjects ( 11 % ) receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily experienced hypotension with a hypersensitivity reaction compared with zero subjects receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily .
Physical findings associated with hypersensitivity to abacavir in some patients include lymphadenopathy , mucous membrane lesions ( conjunctivitis and mouth ulcerations ) , and rash .
The rash usually appears maculopapular or urticarial , but may be variable in appearance .
There have been reports of erythema multiforme .
Hypersensitivity reactions have occurred without rash .
Laboratory abnormalities associated with hypersensitivity to abacavir in some patients include elevated liver function tests , elevated creatine phosphokinase , elevated creatinine , and lymphopenia .
Clinical Management of Hypersensitivity Discontinue abacavir as soon as a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected .
To minimize the risk of a life threatening hypersensitivity reaction , permanently discontinue abacavir if hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out , even when other diagnoses are possible ( e . g . , acute onset respiratory diseases such as pneumonia , bronchitis , pharyngitis , or influenza ; gastroenteritis ; or reactions to other medications ) .
Following a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir , NEVER restart abacavir tablets or any other abacavir - containing product because more severe symptoms can occur within hours and may include life threatening hypotension and death .
When therapy with abacavir has been discontinued for reasons other than symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction , and if reinitiation of abacavir tablets or any other abacavir - containing product is under consideration , carefully evaluate the reason for discontinuation of abacavir to ensure that the patient did not have symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction .
If the patient is of unknown HLA - B * 5701 status , screening for the allele is recommended prior to reinitiation of abacavir .
If hypersensitivity cannot be ruled out , DO NOT reintroduce abacavir tablets or any other abacavir - containing product .
Even in the absence of the HLA - B * 5701 allele , it is important to permanently discontinue abacavir and not rechallenge with abacavir if a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out on clinical grounds , due to the potential for a severe or even fatal reaction .
If symptoms consistent with hypersensitivity are not identified , reintroduction can be undertaken with continued monitoring for symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction .
Make patients aware that a hypersensitivity reaction can occur with reintroduction of abacavir tablets or any other abacavir - containing product and that reintroduction of abacavir tablets or any other abacavir - containing product needs to be undertaken only if medical care can be readily accessed by the patient or others .
Risk Factor : HLA - B * 5701 Allele : Trials have shown that carriage of the HLA - B * 5701 allele is associated with a significantly increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir .
CNA106030 ( PREDICT - 1 ) , a randomized , double - blind trial , evaluated the clinical utility of prospective HLA - B * 5701 screening on the incidence of abacavir hypersensitivity reaction in abacavir - naive HIV - 1 - infected adults ( n = 1 , 650 ) .
In this trial , use of pre - therapy screening for the HLA - B * 5701 allele and exclusion of subjects with this allele reduced the incidence of clinically suspected abacavir hypersensitivity reactions from 7 . 8 % ( 66 / 847 ) to 3 . 4 % ( 27 / 803 ) .
Based on this trial , it is estimated that 61 % of patients with the HLA - B * 5701 allele will develop a clinically suspected hypersensitivity reaction during the course of abacavir treatment compared with 4 % of patients who do not have the HLA - B * 5701 allele .
Screening for carriage of the HLA - B * 5701 allele is recommended prior to initiating treatment with abacavir .
Screening is also recommended prior to reinitiation of abacavir in patients of unknown HLA - B * 5701 status who have previously tolerated abacavir .
For HLA - B * 5701 - positive patients , initiating or reinitiating treatment with an abacavir - containing regimen is not recommended and should be considered only with close medical supervision and under exceptional circumstances where potential benefit outweighs the risk .
Skin patch testing is used as a research tool and should not be used to aid in the clinical diagnosis of abacavir hypersensitivity .
In any patient treated with abacavir , the clinical diagnosis of hypersensitivity reaction must remain the basis of clinical decision - making .
Even in the absence of the HLA - B * 5701 allele , it is important to permanently discontinue abacavir and not rechallenge with abacavir if a hypersensitivity reaction cannot be ruled out on clinical grounds , due to the potential for a severe or even fatal reaction .
5 . 2 Lactic Acidosis / Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis , including fatal cases , have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination , including abacavir and other antiretrovirals .
A majority of these cases have been in women .
Obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may be risk factors .
Particular caution should be exercised when administering abacavir to any patient with known risk factors for liver disease ; however , cases have also been reported in patients with no known risk factors .
Treatment with abacavir should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity ( which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations ) .
5 . 3 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy , including abacavir .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [ PCP ] , or tuberculosis ) , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
Autoimmune disorders ( such as Graves ’ disease , polymyositis , and Guillain - Barré syndrome ) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution , however , the time to onset is more variable , and can occur many months after initiation of treatment .
5 . 4 Fat Redistribution Redistribution / accumulation of body fat including central obesity , dorsocervical fat enlargement ( buffalo hump ) , peripheral wasting , facial wasting , breast enlargement , and “ cushingoid appearance ” have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy .
The mechanism and long - term consequences of these events are currently unknown .
A causal relationship has not been established .
5 . 5 Myocardial Infarction In a published prospective , observational , epidemiological study designed to investigate the rate of myocardial infarction in patients on combination antiretroviral therapy , the use of abacavir within the previous 6 months was correlated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction ( MI ) . 1 In a sponsor - conducted pooled analysis of clinical trials , no excess risk of myocardial infarction was observed in abacavir - treated subjects as compared with control subjects .
In totality , the available data from the observational cohort and from clinical trials are inconclusive .
As a precaution , the underlying risk of coronary heart disease should be considered when prescribing antiretroviral therapies , including abacavir , and action taken to minimize all modifiable risk factors ( e . g . , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , diabetes mellitus , smoking ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling : • Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reaction .
In one trial , once daily dosing of abacavir was associated with more severe hypersensitivity reactions [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
• Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
• Immune reconstitution syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
• Fat redistribution [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
• Myocardial infarction [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
• The most commonly reported adverse reactions of at least moderate intensity ( incidence ≥ 10 % ) in adult HIV - 1 clinical trials were nausea , headache , malaise and fatigue , nausea and vomiting , and dreams / sleep disorders .
( 6 . 1 ) • The most commonly reported adverse reactions of at least moderate intensity ( incidence ≥ 5 % ) in pediatric HIV - 1 clinical trials were fever and / or chills , nausea and vomiting , skin rashes , and ear / nose / throat infections .

During the blinded portion of the trial , suspected hypersensitivity to abacavir was reported by investigators in 9 % of 324 subjects in the abacavir group and 3 % of 325 subjects in the zidovudine group .
[ 2 ] Ten ( 3 % ) cases of suspected drug hypersensitivity were reclassified as not being due to abacavir following unblinding .
Treatment - emergent clinical adverse reactions ( rated by the investigator as moderate or severe ) with a greater than or equal to 5 % frequency during therapy with abacavir 300 mg twice daily , lamivudine 150 mg twice daily , and zidovudine 300 mg twice daily compared with indinavir 800 mg 3 times daily , lamivudine 150 mg twice daily , and zidovudine 300 mg twice daily from CNA3005 are listed in Table 3 .

The background rates of preexisting depression were similar in the two treatment arms .
Abacavir Once Daily Versus Abacavir Twice Daily ( CNA30021 ) Treatment - emergent clinical adverse reactions ( rated by the investigator as at least moderate ) with a greater than or equal to 5 % frequency during therapy with abacavir 600 mg once daily or abacavir 300 mg twice daily both in combination with lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily from CNA30021 were similar .
For hypersensitivity reactions , subjects receiving abacavir once daily showed a rate of 9 % in comparison with a rate of 7 % for subjects receiving abacavir twice daily .
However , subjects receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily , experienced a significantly higher incidence of severe drug hypersensitivity reactions and severe diarrhea compared with subjects who received abacavir 300 mg twice daily .
Five percent ( 5 % ) of subjects receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily had severe drug hypersensitivity reactions compared with 2 % of subjects receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily .
Two percent ( 2 % ) of subjects receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily had severe diarrhea while none of the subjects receiving abacavir 300 mg twice daily had this event .
Laboratory Abnormalities Laboratory abnormalities ( Grades 3 to 4 ) in therapy - naive adults during therapy with abacavir 300 mg twice daily , lamivudine 150 mg twice daily , and efavirenz 600 mg daily compared with zidovudine 300 mg twice daily , lamivudine 150 mg twice daily , and efavirenz 600 mg daily from CNA30024 are listed in Table 4 .

Mild elevations of blood glucose were more frequent in pediatric patients receiving abacavir ( CNA3006 ) as compared with adult subjects ( CNA30024 ) .
Other Adverse Events In addition to adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities reported in Tables 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 , other adverse reactions observed in the expanded access program were pancreatitis and increased GGT .
6 . 2 Post - marketing Experience In addition to adverse reactions reported from clinical trials , the following reactions have been identified during post - marketing use of abacavir .
Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , estimates of frequency cannot be made .
These reactions have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness , frequency of reporting , or potential causal connection to abacavir .
Body as a Whole : Redistribution / accumulation of body fat .
Cardiovascular : Myocardial infarction .
Hepatic : Lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis .
Skin : Suspected Stevens - Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and TEN , respectively .
Because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and TEN , and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients , abacavir should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases .
There have also been reports of erythema multiforme with abacavir use .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Ethanol : Decreases elimination of abacavir .
( 7 . 1 ) • Methadone : An increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients .
( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Ethanol Abacavir has no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol .
Ethanol decreases the elimination of abacavir causing an increase in overall exposure [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Methadone The addition of methadone has no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir .
In a trial of 11 HIV - 1 - infected subjects receiving methadone - maintenance therapy with 600 mg of abacavir twice daily ( twice the currently recommended dose ) , oral methadone clearance increased [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients ; however , an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category C Studies in pregnant rats showed that abacavir is transferred to the fetus through the placenta .
Fetal malformations ( increased incidences of fetal anasarca and skeletal malformations ) and developmental toxicity ( depressed fetal body weight and reduced crown - rump length ) were observed in rats at a dose which produced 35 times the human exposure based on AUC .
Embryonic and fetal toxicities ( increased resorptions , decreased fetal body weights ) and toxicities to the offspring ( increased incidence of stillbirth and lower body weights ) occurred at half of the above - mentioned dose in separate fertility studies conducted in rats .
In the rabbit , no developmental toxicity and no increases in fetal malformations occurred at doses that produced 8 . 5 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC .
There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women .
Abacavir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits outweigh the risk .
Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry To monitor maternal - fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to abacavir , an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established .
Physicians are encouraged to register patients by calling 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV - 1 - infected mothers not breast - feed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV - 1 infection .
Although it is not known if abacavir is excreted in human milk , abacavir is secreted into the milk of lactating rats .
Because of both the potential for HIV - 1 transmission and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants , mothers should be instructed not to breast - feed if they are receiving abacavir .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of abacavir have been established in pediatric patients 3 months to 13 years of age .
Use of abacavir in these age groups is supported by pharmacokinetic trials and evidence from adequate and well controlled trials of abacavir in adults and pediatric patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of abacavir did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known antidote for abacavir .
It is not known whether abacavir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis .
11 DESCRIPTION Abacavir sulfate is a synthetic carbocyclic nucleoside analogue with inhibitory activity against HIV - 1 .
The chemical name of abacavir sulfate is ( 1 S , cis ) - 4 - [ 2 - amino - 6 - ( cyclopropylamino ) - 9 H - purin - 9 - yl ] - 2 - cyclopentene - 1 - methanol sulfate ( salt ) ( 2 : 1 ) .
Abacavir sulfate is the enantiomer with 1 S , 4 R absolute configuration on the cyclopentene ring .
It has a molecular formula of ( C14H18N6O ) 2 • H2SO4 and a molecular weight of 670 . 76 daltons .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Abacavir sulfate , USP is an off - white to cream colored crystalline powder with a solubility of approximately 77 mg / mL in distilled water at 25 ° C .
It has an octanol / water ( pH 7 . 1 to 7 . 3 ) partition coefficient ( log P ) of approximately 1 . 20 at 25 ° C . Abacavir tablets , USP are for oral administration .
Each tablet contains abacavir sulfate , USP equivalent to 300 mg of abacavir as active ingredient and the following inactive ingredients : colloidal silicon dioxide , hypromellose , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose , polyethylene glycol , red iron oxide , sodium starch glycolate , titanium dioxide and yellow iron oxide .
In vivo , abacavir sulfate dissociates to its free base , abacavir .
All dosages for abacavir tablets are expressed in terms of abacavir .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Abacavir is an antiviral agent [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics in Adults The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have been studied in asymptomatic , HIV - 1 - infected adult patients after administration of a single intravenous ( IV ) dose of 150 mg and after single and multiple oral doses .
The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir were independent of dose over the range of 300 to 1 , 200 mg / day .
Absorption and Bioavailability Abacavir was rapidly and extensively absorbed after oral administration .
The geometric mean absolute bioavailability of the tablet was 83 % .
After oral administration of 300 mg twice daily in 20 subjects , the steady - state peak serum abacavir concentration ( Cmax ) was 3 ± 0 . 89 mcg / mL ( mean ± SD ) and AUC ( 0 - 12 hr ) was 6 . 02 ± 1 . 73 mcg • hr / mL .
After oral administration of a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir in 20 subjects , Cmax was 4 . 26 ± 1 . 19 mcg / mL ( mean ± SD ) and AUC ∞ was 11 . 95 ± 2 . 51 mcg • hr / mL .
Distribution The apparent volume of distribution after IV administration of abacavir was 0 . 86 ± 0 . 15 L / kg , suggesting that abacavir distributes into extravascular space .
In three subjects , the CSF AUC ( 0 - 6 hr ) to plasma abacavir AUC ( 0 - 6 hr ) ratio ranged from 27 % to 33 % .
Binding of abacavir to human plasma proteins is approximately 50 % .
Binding of abacavir to plasma proteins was independent of concentration .
Total blood and plasma drug - related radioactivity concentrations are identical , demonstrating that abacavir readily distributes into erythrocytes .
Metabolism In humans , abacavir is not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes .
The primary routes of elimination of abacavir are metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase ( to form the 5 ′ - carboxylic acid ) and glucuronyl transferase ( to form the 5 ′ - glucuronide ) .
The metabolites do not have antiviral activity .
In vitro experiments reveal that abacavir does not inhibit human CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 , or CYP2C9 activity at clinically relevant concentrations .
Elimination Elimination of abacavir was quantified in a mass balance trial following administration of a 600 mg dose of 14 C - abacavir : 99 % of the radioactivity was recovered , 1 . 2 % was excreted in the urine as abacavir , 30 % as the 5 ′ - carboxylic acid metabolite , 36 % as the 5 ′ - glucuronide metabolite and 15 % as unidentified minor metabolites in the urine .
Fecal elimination accounted for 16 % of the dose .
In single - dose trials , the observed elimination half - life ( t1 / 2 ) was 1 . 54 ± 0 . 63 hours .
After intravenous administration , total clearance was 0 . 8 ± 0 . 24 L / hr / kg ( mean ± SD ) .
Effects of Food on Oral Absorption Bioavailability of abacavir tablets was assessed in the fasting and fed states .
There was no significant difference in systemic exposure ( AUC ∞ ) in the fed and fasting states ; therefore , abacavir tablets may be administered with or without food .
Systemic exposure to abacavir was comparable after administration of abacavir oral solution and abacavir tablets .
Therefore , these products may be used interchangeably .
Special Populations Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir have not been determined in patients with impaired renal function .
Renal excretion of unchanged abacavir is a minor route of elimination in humans .
Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied in subjects with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh score 5 to 6 ) .
Results showed that there was a mean increase of 89 % in the abacavir AUC , and an increase of 58 % in the half - life of abacavir after a single dose of 600 mg of abacavir .
The AUCs of the metabolites were not modified by mild liver disease ; however , the rates of formation and elimination of the metabolites were decreased .
A dose of 200 mg ( provided by 10 mL of abacavir oral solution ) administered twice daily is recommended for patients with mild liver disease .
The safety , efficacy , and pharmacokinetics of abacavir have not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment , therefore abacavir is contraindicated in these patients .
Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have been studied after either single or repeat doses of abacavir in 68 pediatric subjects .
Following multiple dose administration of abacavir 8 mg / kg twice daily , steady - state AUC ( 0 - 12 hr ) and Cmax were 9 . 8 ± 4 . 56 mcg • hr / mL and 3 . 71 ± 1 . 36 mcg / mL ( mean ± SD ) , respectively [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
In addition , to support dosing of abacavir scored tablet ( 300 mg ) for pediatric patients 14 kg to greater than 30 kg , analysis of actual and simulated pharmacokinetic data indicated comparable exposures are expected following administration of 300 mg scored tablet and the 8 mg / kg dosing regimen using oral solution .
Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of abacavir have not been studied in patients over 65 years of age .
Gender A population pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV - 1 - infected male ( n = 304 ) and female ( n = 67 ) subjects showed no gender differences in abacavir AUC normalized for lean body weight .
Race There are no significant differences between blacks and Caucasians in abacavir pharmacokinetics .
Drug Interactions In human liver microsomes , abacavir did not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoforms ( 2C9 , 2D6 , 3A4 ) .
Based on these data , it is unlikely that clinically significant drug interactions will occur between abacavir and drugs metabolized through these pathways .
Lamivudine and / or Zidovudine Due to the common metabolic pathways of abacavir and zidovudine via glucuronyl transferase , 15 HIV - 1 - infected subjects were enrolled in a crossover trial evaluating single doses of abacavir ( 600 mg ) , lamivudine ( 150 mg ) , and zidovudine ( 300 mg ) alone or in combination .
Analysis showed no clinically relevant changes in the pharmacokinetics of abacavir with the addition of lamivudine or zidovudine or the combination of lamivudine and zidovudine .
Lamivudine exposure ( AUC decreased 15 % ) and zidovudine exposure ( AUC increased 10 % ) did not show clinically relevant changes with concurrent abacavir .
Ethanol Due to the common metabolic pathways of abacavir and ethanol via alcohol dehydrogenase , the pharmacokinetic interaction between abacavir and ethanol was studied in 24 HIV - 1 - infected male subjects .
Each subject received the following treatments on separate occasions : a single 600 mg dose of abacavir , 0 . 7 g / kg ethanol ( equivalent to five alcoholic drinks ) , and abacavir 600 mg plus 0 . 7 g / kg ethanol .
Coadministration of ethanol and abacavir resulted in a 41 % increase in abacavir AUC ∞ and a 26 % increase in abacavir t1 / 2 .
In males , abacavir had no effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of ethanol , so no clinically significant interaction is expected in men .
This interaction has not been studied in females .
Methadone In a study of 11 HIV - 1 - infected subjects receiving methadone - maintenance therapy ( 40 mg and 90 mg daily ) , with 600 mg of abacavir twice daily ( twice the currently recommended dose ) , oral methadone clearance increased 22 % ( 90 % CI : 6 % to 42 % ) .
This alteration will not result in a methadone dose modification in the majority of patients ; however , an increased methadone dose may be required in a small number of patients .
The addition of methadone had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetic properties of abacavir .
12 . 4 Microbiology Abacavir is a carbocyclic synthetic nucleoside analogue .
Abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite , carbovir triphosphate ( CBV - TP ) , an analogue of deoxyguanosine - 5 ′ - triphosphate ( dGTP ) .
CBV - TP inhibits the activity of HIV - 1 reverse transcriptase ( RT ) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA .
The lack of a 3 ′ - OH group in the incorporated nucleotide analogue prevents the formation of the 5 ′ to 3 ′ phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation , and therefore , the viral DNA growth is terminated .
CBV - TP is a weak inhibitor of cellular DNA polymerases α , β , and γ .
Antiviral Activity The antiviral activity of abacavir against HIV - 1 was evaluated against a T - cell tropic laboratory strain HIV - 1 IIIB in lymphoblastic cell lines , a monocyte / macrophage tropic laboratory strain HIV - 1 BaL in primary monocytes / macrophages , and clinical isolates in peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
The concentration of drug necessary to effect viral replication by 50 percent ( EC50 ) ranged from 3 . 7 to 5 . 8 μM ( 1 μM = 0 . 28 mcg / mL ) and 0 . 07 to 1 μM against HIV - 1 IIIB and HIV - 1 BaL , respectively , and was 0 . 26 ± 0 . 18 μM against eight clinical isolates .
The EC50 values of abacavir against different HIV - 1 clades ( A - G ) ranged from 0 . 0015 to 1 . 05 μM , and against HIV - 2 isolates , from 0 . 024 to 0 . 49 μM .
Abacavir had synergistic activity in cell culture in combination with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) zidovudine , the non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) nevirapine , and the protease inhibitor ( PI ) amprenavir ; and additive activity in combination with the NRTIs didanosine , emtricitabine , lamivudine , stavudine , tenofovir , and zalcitabine .
Ribavirin ( 50 μM ) had no effect on the anti – HIV - 1 activity of abacavir in cell culture .
Resistance HIV - 1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to abacavir have been selected in cell culture and were also obtained from subjects treated with abacavir .
Genotypic analysis of isolates selected in cell culture and recovered from abacavir - treated subjects demonstrated that amino acid substitutions K65R , L74V , Y115F , and M184V / I in RT contributed to abacavir resistance .
In a trial of therapy - naive adults receiving abacavir 600 mg once daily ( n = 384 ) or 300 mg twice daily ( n = 386 ) , in a background regimen of lamivudine 300 mg once daily and efavirenz 600 mg once daily ( CNA30021 ) , the incidence of virologic failure at 48 weeks was similar between the two groups ( 11 % in both arms ) .
Genotypic ( n = 38 ) and phenotypic analyses ( n = 35 ) of virologic failure isolates from this trial showed that the RT substitutions that emerged during abacavir once daily and twice daily therapy were K65R , L74V , Y115F , and M184V / I .
The substitution M184V / I was the most commonly observed substitution in virologic failure isolates from subjects receiving abacavir once daily ( 56 % , 10 / 18 ) and twice daily ( 40 % , 8 / 20 ) .
Thirty - nine percent ( 7 / 18 ) of the isolates from subjects who experienced virologic failure in the abacavir once daily arm had a greater than 2 . 5 - fold decrease in abacavir susceptibility with a median - fold decrease of 1 . 3 ( range : 0 . 5 to 11 ) compared with 29 % ( 5 / 17 ) of the failure isolates in the twice daily arm with a median - fold decrease of 0 . 92 ( range : 0 . 7 to 13 ) .
Cross - resistance Cross - resistance has been observed among NRTIs .
Isolates containing abacavir resistance - associated substitutions , namely , K65R , L74V , Y115F , and M184V , exhibited cross - resistance to didanosine , emtricitabine , lamivudine , tenofovir , and zalcitabine in cell culture and in subjects .
The K65R substitution can confer resistance to abacavir , didanosine , emtricitabine , lamivudine , stavudine , tenofovir , and zalcitabine ; the L74V substitution can confer resistance to abacavir , didanosine , and zalcitabine ; and the M184V substitution can confer resistance to abacavir , didanosine , emtricitabine , lamivudine , and zalcitabine .
An increasing number of thymidine analogue mutations ( TAMs : M41L , D67N , K70R , L210W , T215Y / F , K219E / R / H / Q / N ) is associated with a progressive reduction in abacavir susceptibility .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity : Abacavir was administered orally at three dosage levels to separate groups of mice and rats in 2 - year carcinogenicity studies .
Results showed an increase in the incidence of malignant and non - malignant tumors .
Malignant tumors occurred in the preputial gland of males and the clitoral gland of females of both species , and in the liver of female rats .
In addition , non - malignant tumors also occurred in the liver and thyroid gland of female rats .
These observations were made at systemic exposures in the range of 6 to 32 times the human exposure at the recommended dose .
It is not known how predictive the results of rodent carcinogenicity studies may be for humans .
Mutagenicity : Abacavir induced chromosomal aberrations both in the presence and absence of metabolic activation in an in vitro cytogenetic study in human lymphocytes .
Abacavir was mutagenic in the absence of metabolic activation , although it was not mutagenic in the presence of metabolic activation in an L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay .
Abacavir was clastogenic in males and not clastogenic in females in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay .
Abacavir was not mutagenic in bacterial mutagenicity assays in the presence and absence of metabolic activation .
Impairment of Fertility : Abacavir had no adverse effects on the mating performance or fertility of male and female rats at a dose approximately 8 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on body surface area comparisons .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Myocardial degeneration was found in mice and rats following administration of abacavir for 2 years .
The systemic exposures were equivalent to 7 to 24 times the expected systemic exposure in humans .
The clinical relevance of this finding has not been determined .
