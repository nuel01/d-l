Avoid coadministration of SCEMBLIX at 200 mg twice daily with sensitive CYP2C9 substrates and certain CYP2C9 substrates , where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions .
If coadministration is unavoidable , consider alternative therapy with a non - CYP2C9 substrate .
Certain P - gp Substrates Asciminib is a P - gp inhibitor .
Concomitant use of SCEMBLIX increases the plasma concentrations of P - gp substrates , which may increase the risk of adverse reactions of these substrates [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Closely monitor for adverse reactions in patients treated with SCEMBLIX at all recommended doses with concomitant use of P - gp substrates , where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious toxicities .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action , SCEMBLIX can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data on SCEMBLIX use in pregnant women to evaluate a drug associated risk .
Animal reproduction studies in pregnant rats and rabbits demonstrated that oral administration of asciminib during organogenesis induced structural abnormalities , embryo - fetal mortality , and alterations to growth ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In embryo - fetal development studies , pregnant animals received oral doses of asciminib at 25 , 150 , and 600 mg / kg / day in rats and at 15 , 50 , and 300 mg / kg / day in rabbits during the period of organogenesis .
In rats , maternal toxicity at the asciminib dose of 600 mg / kg / day resulted in the early termination of the dose group ; a complete embryo - fetal examination was not conducted for this group .
Adverse embryo - fetal findings were observed at 25 and 150 mg / kg ; these doses did not cause maternal toxicities .
Increases in fetal weights at 25 and 150 mg / kg / day were observed , which may be related to increased ossification ( i . e . , increased rate of development ) .
Malformations were evident at 150 mg / kg and included cleft palate , anasarca ( edema ) , and cardiac abnormalities .
Additional fetal findings included urinary tract and skeletal variations , observed primarily at 150 mg / kg / day .
At the dose of 25 mg / kg / day , the area under the curve ( AUC ) exposures were equivalent to or below those achieved in patients at the 40 mg twice daily or 80 mg once daily doses , respectively .
At the dose of 25 mg / kg / day , the AUC exposures were below those achieved in patients at the 200 mg twice daily dose .
In rabbits , maternal toxicities at the asciminib dose of 300 mg / kg / day resulted in the early termination of the dose group ; a complete embryo - fetal examination was not conducted for this group .
Adverse embryo - fetal findings were observed at 50 mg / kg ; this dose did not cause maternal toxicities .
Findings at the 50 mg / kg dose included increases in early resorptions and post - implantation loss , decreases in the number of live fetuses , and cardiac malformations .
At the dose of 50 mg / kg / day , the AUC exposures were 4 - fold those achieved in patients at the 40 mg twice daily or 80 mg once daily doses .
At the dose of 50 mg / kg / day , the AUC exposures were below those achieved in patients at the 200 mg twice daily dose .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of asciminib or its metabolites in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with SCEMBLIX and for 1 week after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on findings from animal studies , SCEMBLIX can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to starting treatment with SCEMBLIX .
Contraception Females Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment with SCEMBLIX and for 1 week after the last dose .
Infertility Based on findings in animals , SCEMBLIX may impair fertility in females of reproductive potential [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of SCEMBLIX in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In the ASCEMBL study , 44 of the 233 ( 19 % ) patients were 65 years of age or older and 6 ( 2 . 6 % ) were 75 years of age or older .
In the X2101 study , 16 of the 48 ( 33 % ) patients with the T315I mutation were 65 years of age or older and 4 ( 8 % ) were 75 years of age or older .
Overall , no differences in safety or efficacy of SCEMBLIX were observed between patients 65 years of age or older compared to younger patients .
There is an insufficient number of patients 75 years of age or older to assess whether there are differences in safety or efficacy .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild to severe renal impairment ( estimated glomerular filtration rate [ eGFR ] 15 to 89 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) and not requiring dialysis receiving SCEMBLIX [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild [ total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal ( ULN ) and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) > ULN or total bilirubin > 1 to 1 . 5 times ULN and any AST ] to severe hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 3 times ULN and any AST ) receiving SCEMBLIX [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION SCEMBLIX ( asciminib ) is a kinase inhibitor .
The chemical name of the drug substance is N - [ 4 - ( Chlorodifluoromethoxy ) phenyl ] - 6 - [ ( 3 R ) - 3 - hydroxypyrrolidin - 1 - yl ] - 5 - ( 1 H - pyrazol - 3 - yl ) pyridine - 3 - carboxamide - hydrogen chloride ( 1 / 1 ) .
Asciminib hydrochloride is a white to slightly yellow powder .
The molecular formula of asciminib hydrochloride is C20H18ClF2N5O3 . HCl , and the relative molecular mass is 486 . 30 g / mol for the hydrochloride salt and 449 . 84 g / mol for the free base .
The chemical structure of asciminib hydrochloride is shown below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] SCEMBLIX film - coated tablets are supplied for oral use with two strengths that contain 20 mg and 40 mg of asciminib ( equivalent to 21 . 62 mg and 43 . 24 mg , respectively , of asciminib hydrochloride ) .
The tablets contain colloidal silicon dioxide , croscarmellose sodium , ferric oxide , hydroxypropyl cellulose , lactose monohydrate , lecithin , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose , polyvinyl alcohol , talc , titanium dioxide , and xanthan gum .
The 20 mg tablets contain ferric oxide , yellow and ferric oxide , red .
The 40 mg tablets contain ferrosoferric oxide and ferric oxide , red .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Asciminib is an ABL / BCR - ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor .
Asciminib inhibits the ABL1 kinase activity of the BCR - ABL1 fusion protein , by binding to the ABL myristoyl pocket .
In studies conducted in vitro or in animal models of CML , asciminib showed activity against wild - type BCR - ABL1 and several mutant forms of the kinase , including the T315I mutation .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure - Response Relationships Over asciminib dosages of 10 mg to 200 mg twice daily ( 0 . 25 to 5 times the recommended 80 mg daily dosage ) , a lower exposure was associated with a smaller decrease in BCR - ABL1 level and a lower MMR rate at Week 24 .
Over asciminib dosages of 10 mg to 280 mg twice daily ( 0 . 25 to 7 times the recommended 80 mg daily dosage ) , a higher exposure was associated with slightly higher incidence of some adverse reactions ( e . g . , Grade ≥ 3 lipase increase , Grade ≥ 3 hemoglobin decrease , Grade ≥ 2 ALT increase , Grade ≥ 2 AST increase , Grade ≥ 2 bilirubin increase , and any grade lipase increase ) .
Cardiac Electrophysiology Asciminib does not cause a large mean increase in QTc interval ( i . e . , > 20 msec ) at the maximum recommended clinical dosage ( 200 mg twice daily ) .
Based on available clinical data , small mean QTc increase ( < 10 msec ) cannot be excluded .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Asciminib steady - state exposure ( AUC and Cmax ) increase slightly more than dose proportional across the dose range of 10 to 200 mg ( 0 . 25 to 5 times the recommended 80 mg daily dosage ) administered once or twice daily .
Pharmacokinetic parameters are presented as geometric mean ( CV % ) unless otherwise stated .
The steady state Cmax and AUCtau of asciminib at recommended dosages are listed in Table 7 .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with asciminib .
Asciminib was not genotoxic in an in vitro bacterial mutagenicity ( Ames ) assay , an in vitro micronucleus assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes ( HPBL ) , or an in vivo rat peripheral blood reticulocyte micronucleus assay .
In a combined male and female fertility and early embryonic development study in rats , animals were administered asciminib doses of 10 , 50 , or 200 mg / kg / day orally .
Male animals were dosed once daily for at least 28 days prior to mating , during the 2 - week mating period , and until terminal necropsy ( Days 63 - 67 ) .
Female animals were dosed once daily for the 2 - week premating period , during the 2 - week mating period , and through gestation day ( GD ) 6 .
Decreased sperm count and motility were observed at 200 mg / kg / day .
While there were no effects on fertility indices or conception rates , a decreased mean number of live embryos was observed at 200 mg / kg / day and was attributed to a lower number of implantations and an increased number of early resorptions .
Increased early resorptions were also observed in the embryo - fetal development study in rabbits [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
At the dose of 200 mg / kg , the AUC exposures were approximately 19 - fold , 13 - fold , or 2 - fold higher than those achieved in patients at the 40 mg twice daily , 80 mg once daily , or 200 mg twice daily doses , respectively .
