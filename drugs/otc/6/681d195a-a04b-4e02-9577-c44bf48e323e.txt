1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Focalin XR is indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) in patients aged 6 years and older .
The effectiveness of Focalin XR in the treatment of ADHD in patients aged 6 years and older was established in two placebo - controlled studies in patients meeting DSM - IV criteria for ADHD [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
A diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ; DSM - IV ) implies the presence of hyperactive - impulsive or inattentive symptoms that caused impairment and were present before age 7 years .
The symptoms must cause clinically significant impairment , e . g . , in social , academic , or occupational functioning , and be present in two or more settings , e . g . , school ( or work ) and at home .
The symptoms must not be better accounted for by another mental disorder .
For the Inattentive Type , at least six of the following symptoms must have persisted for at least 6 months : lack of attention to details / careless mistakes ; lack of sustained attention ; poor listener ; failure to follow through on tasks ; poor organization ; avoids tasks requiring sustained mental effort ; loses things ; easily distracted ; forgetful .
For the Hyperactive - Impulsive Type , at least six of the following symptoms must have persisted for at least 6 months : fidgeting / squirming ; leaving seat ; inappropriate running / climbing ; difficulty with quiet activities ; “ on the go ” ; excessive talking ; blurting answers ; can ’ t wait turn ; intrusive .
The Combined Types requires both inattentive and hyperactive - impulsive criteria to be met .
Special Diagnostic Considerations Specific etiology of this syndrome is unknown , and there is no single diagnostic test .
Adequate diagnosis requires the use not only of medical but of special psychological , educational , and social resources .
Learning may or may not be impaired .
The diagnosis must be based upon a complete history and evaluation of the child and not solely on the presence of the required number of DSM - IV characteristics .
Need for Comprehensive Treatment Program Focalin XR is indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for ADHD that may include other measures ( psychological , educational , social ) for patients with this syndrome .
Drug treatment may not be indicated for all children with this syndrome .
Stimulants are not intended for use in the child who exhibits symptoms secondary to environmental factors and / or other primary psychiatric disorders , including psychosis .
Appropriate educational placement is essential and psychosocial intervention is often helpful .
When remedial measures alone are insufficient , the decision to prescribe stimulant medication will depend upon the physician ’ s assessment of the chronicity and severity of the child ’ s symptoms .
Long - Term Use The effectiveness of Focalin XR for long - term use , i . e . , for more than 7 weeks , has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials .
Therefore , the physician who elects to use Focalin XR for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long - term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Focalin XR is a CNS stimulant indicated for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) in patients aged 6 years and older ( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Focalin XR is for oral administration once daily in the morning .
Focalin XR may be swallowed as whole capsules or alternatively may be administered by sprinkling the capsule contents on a small amount of applesauce ( see specific instructions below ) .
Focalin XR and / or their contents should not be crushed , chewed , or divided .
The capsules may be carefully opened and the beads sprinkled over a spoonful of applesauce .
The mixture of drug and applesauce should be consumed immediately in its entirety .
The drug and applesauce mixture should not be stored for future use .
Dosage should be individualized according to the needs and responses of the patient .
• Focalin XR is intended for oral administration once daily in the morning .
Focalin XR capsules may be swallowed whole , or capsule contents can be sprinkled on applesauce .
Focalin XR and / or their contents should not be crushed , chewed , or divided ( 2 ) • For patients new to methylphenidate : Begin treatment with Focalin XR at 5 mg / day for pediatrics and 10 mg / day for adults , titrating the dose weekly in 5 mg increments for pediatrics and in 10 mg increments for adults .
Doses above 30 mg / day in children and 40 mg / day in adults have not been studied .
( 2 . 1 ) • For patients already using methylphenidate : Initiate Focalin XR therapy with half ( 1 / 2 ) the current total daily dose of methylphenidate .
( 2 . 2 ) • Patients already using Focalin ( dexmethylphenidate ) immediate release : switch to the same daily dose of Focalin XR .
( 2 . 2 ) 2 . 1 Patients New to Methylphenidate The recommended starting dose of Focalin XR for patients who are not currently taking dexmethylphenidate or racemic methylphenidate , or for patients who are on stimulants other than methylphenidate , is 5 mg / day for pediatric patients and 10 mg / day for adult patients .
Dosage may be adjusted in 5 mg increments for pediatric patients and in 10 mg increments for adult patients .
In general , dosage adjustments may proceed at approximately weekly intervals .
The patient should be observed for a sufficient duration at a given dose to ensure that a maximal benefit has been achieved before a dose increase is considered .
In dose - response ( fixed - dose ) studies ( pediatric from 10 to 30 mg / day and adult from 20 to 40 mg / day ) , all doses were effective vs . placebo .
There was no clear finding , however , of greater average benefits for the higher doses compared to the lower doses .
Adverse events and discontinuations , however , were dose - related .
Doses above 30 mg / day in pediatrics and 40 mg / day in adults have not been studied and are not recommended .
2 . 2 Patients Currently Using Methylphenidate For patients currently using methylphenidate , the recommended starting dose of Focalin XR is half the total daily dose of racemic methylphenidate .
Patients currently using Focalin ( dexmethylphenidate ) may be switched to the same daily dose of Focalin XR .
2 . 3 Maintenance / Extended Treatment There is no body of evidence available from controlled trials to indicate how long the patient with ADHD should be treated with Focalin XR .
It is generally agreed , however , that pharmacological treatment of ADHD may be needed for extended periods .
Nevertheless , the physician who elects to use Focalin XR for extended periods in patients with ADHD should periodically reevaluate the long - term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient with periods off medication to assess the patient ’ s functioning without pharmacotherapy .
Improvement may be sustained when the drug is either temporarily or permanently discontinued .
2 . 4 Dose Reduction and Discontinuation If paradoxical aggravation of symptoms or other adverse events occur , the dosage should be reduced , or , if necessary , the drug should be discontinued .
If improvement is not observed after appropriate dosage adjustment over a 1 - month period , the drug should be discontinued .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS 5 mg extended - release capsules 10 mg extended - release capsules 15 mg extended - release capsules 20 mg extended - release capsules 25 mg extended - release capsules 30 mg extended - release capsules 35 mg extended - release capsules 40 mg extended - release capsules Extended - release capsules : 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 , and 40 mg 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Agitation , marked anxiety , and tension ( 4 . 1 ) • Known hypersensitivity to methylphenidate or product components ( 4 . 2 ) • Glaucoma ( 4 . 3 ) • History of motor tics or a family history or diagnosis of Tourette ’ s syndrome ( 4 . 4 ) • During , or within a minimum of 14 days following discontinuation of treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) ( 4 . 5 ) 4 . 1 Agitation Focalin XR is contraindicated in patients with marked anxiety , tension , and agitation , since the drug may aggravate these symptoms .
4 . 2 Hypersensitivity to Methylphenidate Focalin XR is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to methylphenidate , or other components of the product .
4 . 3 Glaucoma Focalin XR is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma .
4 . 4 Tics Focalin XR is contraindicated in patients with motor tics or with a family history or diagnosis of Tourette ’ s syndrome [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
4 . 5 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Focalin XR is contraindicated during treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors , and also within a minimum of 14 days following discontinuation of treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( hypertensive crises may result ) .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Serious Cardiovascular Events : Sudden death has been reported in association with CNS stimulant treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems .
Sudden death , stroke , and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking stimulant drugs at usual doses for ADHD .
Stimulant products generally should not be used in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities , cardiomyopathy , serious heart rhythm abnormalities , coronary artery disease , or other serious heart problems .
( 5 . 1 ) • Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate : have been reported .
Monitor patients for changes in blood pressure and heart rate .
Caution should be exercised in treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure or heart rate ( 5 . 2 ) • Assess Cardiovascular Status : prior to stimulant treatment , assess for cardiac disease with history and exam and , if suggested by findings , conduct further cardiac evaluation .
Patients with emerging symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation ( 5 . 3 ) • Psychotic Symptoms : may be exacerbated in patients with psychotic disorders ( 5 . 4 ) • Bipolar Disorder : Use with particular care in ADHD patients with comorbid Bipolar Disorder .
Before initiating stimulant therapy , obtain a detailed psychiatric history for patients with comorbid depressive symptoms , in order to determine risk for Bipolar Disorder .
( 5 . 5 ) • Emergence of New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms : Treatment - emergent psychotic or manic symptoms without a prior history can be caused by stimulants at usual doses .
Discontinuation of stimulant therapy may be indicated ( 5 . 6 ) • Aggression : Monitor for appearance of or worsening of aggressive behavior or hostility ( 5 . 7 ) • Long - Term Suppression of Growth : monitor height and weight in pediatric patients at appropriate intervals .
Patients who are not growing or gaining weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted ( 5 . 8 ) • Seizures : The threshold for seizures may be lowered .
In the presence of seizure , discontinue treatment .
( 5 . 9 ) • Visual Disturbance : difficulties with accommodation and blurring of vision have been reported with stimulant treatment ( 5 . 10 ) • Hematologic Monitoring : periodic monitoring of CBC with differential is advised during prolonged therapy ( 5 . 12 ) 5 . 1 Sudden Death and Pre - Existing Structural Cardiac Abnormalities or Other Serious Heart Problems Children and Adolescents Sudden death has been reported in association with CNS stimulant treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems .
Although some serious heart problems alone carry an increased risk of sudden death , stimulant products generally should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities , cardiomyopathy , serious heart rhythm abnormalities , or other serious cardiac problems that may place them at increased vulnerability to the sympathomimetic effects of a stimulant drug .
Adults Sudden death , stroke , and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking stimulant drugs at usual doses for ADHD .
Although the role of stimulants in these adult cases is also unknown , adults have a greater likelihood than children of having serious structural cardiac abnormalities , cardiomyopathy , serious heart rhythm abnormalities , coronary artery disease , or other serious cardiac problems .
Adults with such abnormalities should also generally not be treated with stimulant drugs .
5 . 2 Hypertension and other Cardiovascular Conditions Stimulant medications cause a modest increase in average blood pressure ( about 2 - 4 mmHg ) and average heart rate ( about 3 - 6 bpm ) , and individuals may have larger increases .
While the mean changes alone would not be expected to have short - term consequences , all patients should be monitored for larger changes in heart rate and blood pressure .
Caution is indicated in treating patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure or heart rate , e . g . , those with pre - existing hypertension , heart failure , recent myocardial infarction , or ventricular arrhythmia .
5 . 3 Assessing Cardiovascular Status in Patients being Treated with Stimulant Medications Children , adolescents , or adults who are being considered for treatment with stimulant medications should have a careful history ( including assessment for a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia ) and physical exam to assess for the presence of cardiac disease , and should receive further cardiac evaluation if findings suggest such disease ( e . g . , electrocardiogram and echocardiogram ) .
Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain , unexplained syncope , or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during stimulant treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation .
5 . 4 Pre - Existing Psychosis Administration of stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre - existing psychotic disorder .
5 . 5 Bipolar Illness Particular care should be taken in using stimulants to treat ADHD in patients with comorbid bipolar disorder because of concern for possible induction of a mixed / manic episode in such patients .
Prior to initiating treatment with a stimulant , patients with comorbid depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder ; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history , including a family history of suicide , bipolar disorder , and depression .
5 . 6 Emergence of New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms Treatment emergent psychotic or manic symptoms , e . g . , hallucinations , delusional thinking , or mania in children and adolescents without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania can be caused by stimulants at usual doses .
If such symptoms occur , consideration should be given to a possible causal role of the stimulant , and discontinuation of treatment may be appropriate .
In a pooled analysis of multiple short - term , placebo - controlled studies , such symptoms occurred in about 0 . 1 % ( 4 patients with events out of 3 , 482 exposed to methylphenidate or amphetamine for several weeks at usual doses ) of stimulant - treated patients compared to 0 in placebo - treated patients .
5 . 7 Aggression Aggressive behavior or hostility is often observed in children and adolescents with ADHD , and has been reported in clinical trials and the post marketing experience of some medications indicated for the treatment of ADHD .
Although there is no systematic evidence that stimulants cause aggressive behavior or hostility , patients beginning treatment for ADHD should be monitored for the appearance of or worsening of aggressive behavior or hostility .
5 . 8 Long - Term Suppression of Growth Careful follow - up of weight and height in children ages 7 to 10 years who were randomized to either methylphenidate or non - medication treatment groups over 14 months , as well as in naturalistic subgroups of newly methylphenidate - treated and non - medication treated children over 36 months ( to the ages of 10 to 13 years ) , suggests that consistently medicated children ( i . e . , treatment for 7 days per week throughout the year ) have a temporary slowing in growth rate ( on average , a total of about 2 cm less growth in height and 2 . 7 kg less growth in weight over 3 years ) , without evidence of growth rebound during this period of development .
In the 7 - week double - blind placebo - controlled study of Focalin XR , the mean weight gain was greater for patients receiving placebo ( + 0 . 4 kg ) than for patients receiving Focalin XR ( - 0 . 5 kg ) .
Published data are inadequate to determine whether chronic use of amphetamines may cause a similar suppression of growth , however , it is anticipated that they likely have this effect as well .
Therefore , growth should be monitored during treatment with stimulants , and patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted .
5 . 9 Seizures There is some clinical evidence that stimulants may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with prior history of seizures , in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in absence of seizures , and , very rarely , in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures .
In the presence of seizures , the drug should be discontinued .
5 . 10 Visual Disturbance Difficulties with accommodation and blurring of vision have been reported with stimulant treatment .
5 . 11 Use in Children Under Six Years of Age Focalin XR should not be used in children under 6 years of age , since safety and efficacy in this age group have not been established .
5 . 12 Hematologic Monitoring Periodic CBC , differential , and platelet counts are advised during prolonged therapy .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Focalin XR was administered to 46 children and 7 adolescents with ADHD for up to 7 weeks and 206 adults with ADHD in clinical studies .
During the clinical studies , 101 adult patients were treated for at least 6 months .
Adverse events during exposure were obtained primarily by general inquiry and recorded by clinical investigators using terminology of their own choosing .
Consequently , it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the proportion of individuals experiencing adverse events without first grouping similar types of events into a smaller number of standardized event categories .
In the tables and listings that follow , MedDRA terminology has been used to classify reported adverse events .
The stated frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced , at least once , a treatment - emergent adverse event of the type listed .
An event was considered treatment emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation .
Most common adverse reactions ( at least 5 % and twice the incidence among placebo - treated patients ) are dyspepsia , decreased appetite , headache , and anxiety for pediatric patients and dry mouth , dyspepsia , headache , and anxiety for adult patients ( 6 ) .

6 . 1 Adverse Events Associated with Discontinuation of Treatmentin Acute Clinical Studies with Focalin XR - Children Overall , 50 of 684 children treated with Focalin immediate - release formulation ( 7 . 3 % ) experienced an adverse event that resulted in discontinuation .
The most common reasons for discontinuation were twitching ( described as motor or vocal tics ) , anorexia , insomnia , and tachycardia ( approximately 1 % each ) .
None of the 53 Focalin XR - treated pediatric patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events in the 7 - week placebo - controlled study .
6 . 2 Adverse Events Occurring at an Incidence of 5 % or More Among Focalin XR - Treated Patients - Children Table 1 enumerates treatment - emergent adverse events for the placebo - controlled , parallel - group study in children and adolescents with ADHD at flexible Focalin XR doses of 5 - 30 mg / day .
The table includes only those events that occurred in 5 % or more of patients treated with Focalin XR and for which the incidence in patients treated with Focalin XR was at least twice the incidence in placebo - treated patients .
The prescriber should be aware that these figures cannot be used to predict the incidence of adverse events in the course of usual medical practice where patient characteristics and other factors differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials .
Similarly , the cited frequencies cannot be compared with figures obtained from other clinical investigations involving different treatments , uses , and investigators .
The cited figures , however , do provide the prescribing physician with some basis for estimating the relative contribution of drug and non - drug factors to the adverse event incidence rate in the population studied .

In children , loss of appetite , abdominal pain , weight loss during prolonged therapy , insomnia , and tachycardia may occur more frequently ; however , any of the other adverse reactions listed below may also occur .
Other reactions include : Cardiac : angina , arrhythmia , palpitations , pulse increased or decreased , tachycardia Gastrointestinal : abdominal pain , nausea Immune : hypersensitivity reactions including skin rash , urticaria , fever , arthralgia , exfoliative dermatitis , erythema multiforme with histopathological findings of necrotizing vasculitis , and thrombocytopenic purpura Metabolism / Nutrition : anorexia , weight loss during prolonged therapy Nervous System : dizziness , drowsiness , dyskinesia , headache , rare reports of Tourette ’ s syndrome , toxic psychosis Vascular : blood pressure increased or decreased , cerebral arteritis and / or occlusion Although a definite causal relationship has not been established , the following have been reported in patients taking methylphenidate : Blood / Lymphatic : leukopenia and / or anemia Hepatobiliary : abnormal liver function , ranging from transaminase elevation to hepatic coma Psychiatric : transient depressed mood , aggressive behavior Skin / Subcutaneous : scalp hair loss Very rare reports of neuroleptic malignant syndrome ( NMS ) have been received , and , in most of these , patients were concurrently receiving therapies associated with NMS .
In a single report , a ten - year - old boy who had been taking methylphenidate for approximately 18 months experienced an NMS - like event within 45 minutes of ingesting his first dose of venlafaxine .
It is uncertain whether this case represented a drug - drug interaction , a response to either drug alone , or some other cause .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Focalin XR should not be used in patients being treated ( currently or within the preceding two weeks ) with MAO Inhibitors [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 5 ) ] .
Because of possible effects on blood pressure , Focalin XR should be used cautiously with pressor agents .
Methylphenidate may decrease the effectiveness of drugs used to treat hypertension .
Dexmethylphenidate is metabolized primarily to d - ritalinic acid by de - esterification and not through oxidative pathways .
The effects of gastrointestinal pH alterations on the absorption of dexmethylphenidate from Focalin XR have not been studied .
Since the modified release characteristics of Focalin XR are pH dependent , the coadministration of antacids or acid suppressants could alter the release of dexmethylphenidate .
Human pharmacologic studies have shown that racemic methylphenidate may inhibit the metabolism of coumarin anticoagulants , anticonvulsants ( e . g . , phenobarbital , phenytoin , primidone ) , and tricyclic drugs ( e . g . , imipramine , clomipramine , desipramine ) .
Downward dose adjustments of these drugs may be required when given concomitantly with methylphenidate .
It may be necessary to adjust the dosage and monitor plasma drug concentration ( or , in the case of coumarin , coagulation times ) , when initiating or discontinuing methylphenidate .
• Focalin XR should not be used in patients being treated ( currently or within the preceding two weeks ) with MAO Inhibitors ( 4 . 5 ) • Focalin XR should be used cautiously with pressor agents ( 7 ) • Antacids or acid suppressants could alter the release of Focalin XR ( 7 ) • Racemic methylphenidate may inhibit the metabolism of coumarin anticoagulants , anticonvulsants , and tricyclic drugs ( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Focalin XR should not be used in children under 6 years of age ( 5 . 11 ) • Pregnancy : Limited human data .
Based on animal data , may cause fetal harm ( 8 . 1 ) .
• Nursing Mothers : Caution should be exercised when administered to a nursing woman ( 8 . 3 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C : There are no adequate and well controlled studies of Focalin in pregnant women .
Dexmethylphenidate did not cause major malformations in rats or rabbits ; however , it did cause delayed skeletal ossification and decreased postweaning weight gain in rats .
Focalin XR should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
In studies conducted in rats and rabbits , dexmethylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 20 and 100 mg / kg / day , respectively , during the period of organogenesis .
No evidence of teratogenic activity was found in either the rat or rabbit study ; however , delayed fetal skeletal ossification was observed at the highest dose level in rats .
When dexmethylphenidate was administered to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses of up to 20 mg / kg / day , postweaning body weight gain was decreased in male offspring at the highest dose , but no other effects on postnatal development were observed .
At the highest doses tested , plasma levels ( AUCs ) of dexmethylphenidate in pregnant rats and rabbits were approximately 5 and 1 times , respectively , those in adults dosed with 20 mg / day .
Racemic methylphenidate has been shown to have teratogenic effects in rabbits when given in doses of 200 mg / kg / day throughout organogenesis .
8 . 2 Labor and Delivery Focalin XR has not been studied in labor and delivery .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether dexmethylphenidate is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised if Focalin XR is administered to a nursing woman .
Information from 4 published case reports on the use of racemic methylphenidate during breastfeeding suggest that at maternal doses of 35 - 80 mg / day , milk concentrations of methylphenidate range from undetectable to 15 . 4 ng / mL .
Based on these limited data , the calculated infant daily dose for an exclusively breastfed infant would be about 0 . 4 – 2 . 9 µg / kg / day or about 0 . 2 - 0 . 7 % of the maternal weight adjusted dose .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Focalin XR in children under 6 years old have not been established .
Long - term effects of Focalin in children have not been well established [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) ] .
In a study conducted in young rats , racemic methylphenidate was administered orally at doses of up to 100 mg / kg / day for 9 weeks , starting early in the postnatal period ( Postnatal Day 7 ) and continuing through sexual maturity ( Postnatal Week 10 ) .
When these animals were tested as adults ( Postnatal Weeks 13 - 14 ) , decreased spontaneous locomotor activity was observed in males and females previously treated with 50 mg / kg / day ( approximately 6 times the maximum recommended human dose [ MRHD ] of racemic methylphenidate on a mg / m2 basis ) or greater , and a deficit in the acquisition of a specific learning task was seen in females exposed to the highest dose ( 12 times the racemic MRHD on a mg / m2 basis ) .
The no effect level for juvenile neurobehavioral development in rats was 5 mg / kg / day ( half the racemic MRHD on a mg / m2 basis ) .
The clinical significance of the long - term behavioral effects observed in rats is unknown .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Focalin XR has not been studied in the geriatric population .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9 . 1 Controlled Substance Class Focalin XR , like other methylphenidate products , is classified as a Schedule II controlled substance by Federal regulation .
9 . 2 Abuse , Dependence , Tolerance See complete boxed warning for drug abuse and dependence information at the beginning of Full Prescribing Information .
10 OVERDOSAGE 10 . 1 Signs and Symptoms Signs and symptoms of acute methylphenidate overdosage , resulting principally from overstimulation of the CNS and from excessive sympathomimetic effects , may include the following : vomiting , agitation , tremors , hyperreflexia , muscle twitching , convulsions ( may be followed by coma ) , euphoria , confusion , hallucinations , delirium , sweating , flushing , headache , hyperpyrexia , tachycardia , palpitations , cardiac arrhythmias , hypertension , mydriasis , and dryness of mucous membranes .
10 . 2 Poison Control Center The physician may wish to consider contacting a poison control center for up - to - date information on the management of overdosage with methylphenidate .
10 . 3 Recommended Treatment As with the management of all overdosage , the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered .
When treating overdose , practitioners should bear in mind that there is a prolonged release of dexmethylphenidate from Focalin XR .
Treatment consists of appropriate supportive measures .

11 DESCRIPTION Focalin XR is an extended - release formulation of dexmethylphenidate with a bi - modal release profile .
Focalin XR uses the proprietary SODAS ( Spheroidal Oral Drug Absorption System ) technology .
Each bead - filled Focalin XR capsule contains half the dose as immediate - release beads and half as enteric - coated , delayed - release beads , thus providing an immediate release of dexmethylphenidate and a second delayed release of dexmethylphenidate .
Focalin XR is available as 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 , and 40 mg extended - release capsules .
Focalin XR 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 , and 40 mg extended - release capsules provide in a single dose the same amount of dexmethylphenidate as dosages of 2 . 5 , 5 , 7 . 5 , 10 , 12 . 5 , 15 , 17 . 5 , or 20 mg of Focalin given b . i . d . as tablets .
Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride , the d - threo enantiomer of racemic methylphenidate hydrochloride , is a central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant .
Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride is methyl α - phenyl - 2 - piperidineacetate hydrochloride , ( R , R ’ ) - ( + ) - .
Its empirical formula is C14H19NO2 • HCl .
Its molecular weight is 269 . 77 and its structural formula is [ MULTIMEDIA ] Note * = asymmetric carbon center Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride is a white to off white powder .
Its solutions are acid to litmus .
It is freely soluble in water and in methanol , soluble in alcohol , and slightly soluble in chloroform and in acetone .
Inactive ingredients : ammonio methacrylate copolymer , FD & C Blue # 2 ( 5 mg , 15 mg , 25 mg , 35 mg , and 40 mg strengths ) , FDA / E172 yellow iron oxide ( 10 mg , 15 mg , 30 mg , 35 mg , and 40 mg strengths ) , gelatin , ink Tan SW - 8010 , methacrylic acid copolymer , polyethylene glycol , sugar spheres , talc , titanium dioxide , and triethyl citrate .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride , the active ingredient in Focalin XR , is a central nervous system stimulant .
Dexmethylphenidate , the more pharmacologically active d - enantiomer of racemic methylphenidate , is thought to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increase the release of these monoamines into the extraneuronal space .
The mode of therapeutic action in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) is not known .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on QT Interval The effect of Focalin ® XR on the QT interval was evaluated in a double - blind , placebo - and open label active ( moxifloxacin ) - controlled study following single doses of Focalin ® XR 40 mg in 75 healthy volunteers .
ECGs were collected up to 12 h post - dose .
Frederica ’ s method for heart rate correction was employed to derive the corrected QT interval ( QTcF ) .
The maximum mean prolongation of QTcF intervals was < 5 ms , and the upper limit of the 90 % confidence interval was below 10 ms for all time matched comparisons versus placebo .
This was below the threshold of clinical concern and there was no evident - exposure response relationship .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Focalin XR produces a bi - modal plasma concentration - time profile ( i . e . , two distinct peaks approximately 4 hours apart ) when orally administered to healthy adults .
The initial rate of absorption for Focalin XR is similar to that of Focalin tablets as shown by the similar rate parameters between the two formulations , i . e . , first peak concentration ( Cmax1 ) , and time to the first peak ( tmax1 ) , which is reached in 1 ½ hours ( typical range 1 - 4 hours ) .
The mean time to the interpeak minimum ( tminip ) is slightly shorter , and time to the second peak ( tmax2 ) is slightly longer for Focalin XR given once daily ( about 6 . 5 hours , range 4 . 5 - 7 hours ) compared to Focalin tablets given in two doses 4 hours apart ( see Figure 1 ) , although the ranges observed are greater for Focalin XR .
Focalin XR given once daily exhibits a lower second peak concentration ( Cmax2 ) , higher interpeak minimum concentrations ( Cminip ) , and less peak and trough fluctuations than Focalin tablets given in two doses given 4 hours apart .
This is due to an earlier onset and more prolonged absorption from the delayed - release beads ( see Figure 1 ) .
The AUC ( exposure ) after administration of Focalin XR given once daily is equivalent to the same total dose of Focalin tablets given in two doses 4 hours apart .
The variability in Cmax , Cmin , and AUC is similar between Focalin XR and Focalin IR with approximately a three - fold range in each .
Radiolabeled racemic methylphenidate is well absorbed after oral administration with approximately 90 % of the radioactivity recovered in urine .
However , due to first pass metabolism the mean absolute bioavailability of dexmethylphenidate when administered in various formulations was 22 - 25 % .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Dose Proportionality Dose proportionality of Focalin XR was evaluated in a randomized , single - dose , five - period , cross - over study with administration of single doses of 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 and 40 mg to healthy adults .
Results confirmed dose proportionality within this dose range .
Food Effects Administration times relative to meals and meal composition may need to be individually titrated .
No food effect study was performed with Focalin XR .
However , the effect of food has been studied in adults with racemic methylphenidate in the same type of extended - release formulation .
The findings of that study are considered applicable to Focalin XR .
After a high fat breakfast , there was a longer lag time until absorption began and variable delays in the time until the first peak concentration , the time until the interpeak minimum , and the time until the second peak .
The first peak concentration and the extent of absorption were unchanged after food relative to the fasting state , although the second peak was approximately 25 % lower .
The effect of a high fat lunch was not examined .
There is no evidence of dose dumping in the presence or absence of food .
There were no differences in the plasma concentration - time profile , when administered with applesauce , compared to administration in the fasting condition .
The results are expected not to differ for Focalin XR .
For patients unable to swallow the capsule , the contents may be sprinkled on applesauce and administered [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Distribution The plasma protein binding of dexmethylphenidate is not known ; racemic methylphenidate is bound to plasma proteins by 12 - 15 % , independent of concentration .
Dexmethylphenidate shows a volume of distribution of 2 . 65 ± 1 . 11 L / kg .
Plasma dexmethylphenidate concentrations decline monophasically following oral administration of Focalin XR .
Metabolism and Excretion In humans , dexmethylphenidate is metabolized primarily to d - α - phenyl - piperidine acetic acid ( also known as d - ritalinic acid ) by de - esterification .
This metabolite has little or no pharmacological activity .
There is no in vivo interconversion to the l - threo - enantiomer , based on a finding of no levels of l - threo - methylphenidate being detectable after administration of up to 40 mg dexmethylphenidate in adults .
After oral dosing of radiolabeled racemic methylphenidate in humans , about 90 % of the radioactivity was recovered in urine .
The main urinary metabolite of racemic ( d , l - ) methylphenidate was d , l - ritalinic acid , accountable for approximately 80 % of the dose .
Urinary excretion of parent compound accounted for 0 . 5 % of an intravenous dose .
In vitro studies showed that dexmethylphenidate did not inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes at concentrations observed after therapeutic doses .
Intravenous dexmethylphenidate was eliminated with a mean clearance of 0 . 40 ± 0 . 12 L / kg .
h - 1 corresponding to 0 . 56 ± 0 . 18 L / min .
The mean terminal elimination half - life of dexmethylphenidate was just over 3 hours in healthy adults and typically varied between 2 and 4 . 5 hours with an occasional subject exhibiting a terminal half - life between 5 and 7 hours .
Children tend to have slightly shorter half - lives with means of 2 – 3 hours .
Special Populations Gender After administration of Focalin XR the first peak , ( Cmax1 ) , was on average 45 % higher in women .
The interpeak minimum and the second peak also tended to be slightly higher in women although the difference was not statistically significant , and these patterns remained even after weight normalization .
Pharmacokinetic parameters for dexmethylphenidate after Focalin immediate - release tablets were similar for boys and girls .
Race There is insufficient experience with the use of Focalin XR to detect ethnic variations in pharmacokinetics .
Age The pharmacokinetics of dexmethylphenidate after Focalin XR administration have not been studied in children less than 18 years of age .
When a similar formulation of racemic methylphenidate was examined in 15 children between 10 and 12 years of age and 3 children with ADHD between 7 and 9 years of age , the time to the first peak was similar , although the time until the between peak minimum , and the time until the second peak were delayed and more variable in children compared to adults .
After administration of the same dose to children and adults , concentrations in children were approximately twice the concentrations observed in adults .
This higher exposure is almost completely due to smaller body size as no relevant age - related differences in dexmethylphenidate pharmacokinetic parameters ( i . e . , clearance and volume of distribution ) are observed after normalization to dose and weight .
Renal Insufficiency There is no experience with the use of Focalin XR in patients with renal insufficiency .
After oral administration of radiolabeled racemic methylphenidate in humans , methylphenidate was extensively metabolized and approximately 80 % of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine in the form of racemic ritalinic acid which is pharmacologically inactive .
Very little unchanged drug is excreted in the urine , thus renal insufficiency is expected to have little effect on the pharmacokinetics of Focalin XR .
Hepatic Insufficiency There is no experience with the use of Focalin XR in patients with hepatic insufficiency ( see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , and Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Lifetime carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out with dexmethylphenidate .
In a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in B6C3F1 mice , racemic methylphenidate caused an increase in hepatocellular adenomas , and in males only , an increase in hepatoblastomas at a daily dose of approximately 60 mg / kg / day .
Hepatoblastoma is a relatively rare rodent malignant tumor type .
There was no increase in total malignant hepatic tumors .
The mouse strain used is sensitive to the development of hepatic tumors , and the significance of these results to humans is unknown .
Racemic methylphenidate did not cause any increase in tumors in a lifetime carcinogenicity study carried out in F344 rats ; the highest dose used was approximately 45 mg / kg / day .
In a 24 - week study of racemic methylphenidate in the transgenic mouse strain p53 + / - , which is sensitive to genotoxic carcinogens , there was no evidence of carcinogenicity .
Mice were fed diets containing the same concentrations as in the lifetime carcinogenicity study ; the high - dose group was exposed to 60 - 74 mg / kg / day of racemic methylphenidate .
Mutagenesis Dexmethylphenidate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Ames reverse mutation assay , the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay , or the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus test .
Racemic methylphenidate was not mutagenic in the in vitro Ames reverse mutation assay or the in vitro mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay , and was negative in vivo in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay .
However , sister chromatid exchanges and chromosome aberrations were increased , indicative of a weak clastogenic response , in an in vitro assay of racemic methylphenidate in cultured Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cells .
Impairment of Fertility Racemic methylphenidate did not impair fertility in male or female mice that were fed diets containing the drug in an 18 - week Continuous Breeding study .
The study was conducted at doses of up to 160 mg / kg / day .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The effectiveness of Focalin XR in the treatment of ADHD was established in randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled studies in children and adolescents and in adults who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 4 th edition ( DSM - IV ) criteria for ADHD [ seeIndications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
14 . 1 Children and Adolescents The effectiveness of Focalin XR was established in a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel - group study in 103 pediatric patients ( ages 6 to 12 , n = 86 ; ages 13 to 17 , n = 17 ) who met DSM - IV criteria for ADHD .
Patients were randomized to receive either a flexible dose of Focalin XR ( 5 to 30 mg / day ) or placebo once daily for 7 weeks .
During the first 5 weeks of treatment patients were titrated to their optimal dose and in the last 2 weeks of the study patients remained on their optimal dose without dose changes or interruption .
Signs and symptoms of ADHD were evaluated by comparing the mean change from baseline to endpoint for Focalin XR – and placebo - treated patients using an intent - to - treat analysis of the primary efficacy outcome measure , the DSM - IV total subscale score of the Conners ADHD / DSM - IV Scales for teachers ( CADS - T ) .
There was a statistically significant treatment effect in favor of Focalin XR .
There were insufficient adolescents enrolled in this study to assess the efficacy for Focalin XR in the adolescent population .
However , pharmacokinetic considerations and evidence of effectiveness of immediate - release Focalin in adolescents support the effectiveness of Focalin XR in this population .
In two additional studies in pediatric patients aged 6 - 12 years who received 20 mg Focalin XR or placebo in a cross - over design , Focalin XR was found to have a statistically significant treatment effect versus placebo on the Swanson , Kotkin , Agler , M - Flynn & Pelham ( SKAMP ) rating scale combined score at all time points after dosing in each study ( 0 . 5 , 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 10 , 11 and 12 hours in one study and 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 and 12 hours in the other study ) .
A treatment effect was also observed 0 . 5 hours after administration of Focalin XR 20 mg in an additional study of ADHD patients aged 6 - 12 years .
The SKAMP is a reliable and validated scale that assesses specificclassroom behaviors related to attention ( e . g . , getting started , sticking with activities , completing work , and stopping for transition ) and deportment or behavior ( e . g . , remaining quiet , remaining seated , interacting with other students , and interactingwith the teacher . )
Each item is rated on a 7 - point impairment scale , and an averagerating per item is calculated for the subscales of Attentionand Deportment .
14 . 2 Adults The effectiveness of Focalin XR was established in a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel - group study in 221 adult patients ( ages 18 to 60 ) who met DSM - IV criteria for ADHD .
Patients were randomized to receive either a fixed dose of Focalin XR ( 20 , 30 , or 40 mg / day ) or placebo once daily for 5 weeks .
Patients randomized to Focalin XR were initiated on a 10 mg / day starting dose and titrated in increments of 10 mg / week to the randomly assigned fixed dose .
Patients were maintained on their fixed dose ( 20 , 30 or 40 mg / day ) for a minimum of 2 weeks .
Signs and symptoms of ADHD were evaluated by comparing the mean change from baseline to endpoint for Focalin XR – and placebo - treated patients using an intent - to - treat analysis of the primary efficacy outcome measure , the investigator - administered DSM - IV Attention - Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale ( DSM - IV ADHD RS ) .
All three Focalin XR doses were statistically significantly superior to placebo .
There was no obvious increase in effectiveness with increasing dose .
