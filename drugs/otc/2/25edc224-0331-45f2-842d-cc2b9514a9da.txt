I . BLOOD COLLECTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR SYSTEMS CONTAINING A Y SAMPLING SITE ( YSS ) ONLY 1 .
Load blood agitation device or suspend blood bag on donor scale and adjust donor scale to desired collection gross weight as per manufacturer ' s instructions .
2 .
Clamp donor tubing between DonorCare ® Needle Guard ( DCNG ) and Y Sampling Site .
3 .
Secure donor tubing above the Y connector and disinfect site of phlebotomy .
4 .
If using blood pressure cuff , inflate to not more than 60 mm Hg .
5 .
Remove donor needle cover and accomplish phlebotomy .
6 .
Release clamp and ensure there is blood flow .
Reduce pressure as required .
7 .
Slide the DCNG midway over the needle hub and securely tape DCNG to the donor ' s arm as close to the top of the DCNG as possible .
Note : If blood flow is slow , slide DCNG away from the needle hub , adjust and re - engage DCNG .
If repeated needle adjustment is necessary , slide DCNG away from the needle hub and re - engage at the end of blood collection .
8 .
Collect appropriate volume of blood into collection bag , as indicated on packaging .
Note : Mix blood and anticoagulant frequently during collection , for example , once every 45 seconds , and immediately after collection .
If blood agitation device is used , follow manufacturer ' s operating instructions .
9 .
After required amount of blood has been collected , seal donor tubing close to Y Sampling Site .
* 10 .
For blood sampling , remove the Y Sampling Site needle cover .
Ensure the protective sheath is in place over the sampling needle .
11 .
Fasten the vacuum tube holder on to the base of the sampling needle .
12 .
Collect blood samples into vacuum tubes .
13 .
Ensure the vacuum tubes are centered within the vacuum tube holder during sample collection .
14 .
Maintain forward pressure on the vacuum tubes during sample collection .
Note : After the last tube is collected , it is recommended that the vacuum tube holder be left in place .
15 .
After blood samples are collected , clamp donor tubing between the Y Sampling Site and DCNG , and as close to the DCNG as possible .
16 .
Release any remaining pressure from the donor ' s arm .
17 .
DCNG must be held stationary while the needle is withdrawn into it .
While holding sides of DCNG near the front , grasp the tubing below the clamp and pull the needle into the DCNG until it locks into place , and the needle hub engages the bottom of the DCNG .
18 .
Insert the DCNG into the vacuum tube holder .
