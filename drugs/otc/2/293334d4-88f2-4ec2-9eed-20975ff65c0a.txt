[ 2 ] Pain includes body pain , skeletal pain , and back pain .
[ 3 ] Death related to sepsis occurred in 3 % of patients receiving topotecan and 1 % of patients receiving CAV .
Hepatobiliary Disorders Based on 879 patients with small cell lung cancer or another solid tumor who were treated with topotecan , Grade 3 or 4 elevated aspartate ( AST ) or alanine transaminase ( ALT ) occurred in 4 % and Grade 3 or 4 elevated bilirubin occurred in less than 2 % of patients .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been identified during postapproval use of topotecan .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Blood and Lymphatic System Severe bleeding ( in association with thrombocytopenia ) Hypersensitivity Allergic manifestations , anaphylactoid reactions , angioedema Gastrointestinal Abdominal pain potentially associated with neutropenic enterocolitis , gastrointestinal perforation Pulmonary Interstitial lung disease Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Severe dermatitis , severe pruritus General and Administration Site Conditions Extravasation , mucosal inflammation 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal data and its mechanism of action , Topotecan Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no available clinical data on the use of topotecan in pregnancy .
Topotecan caused embryolethality , fetotoxicity , and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis at doses similar to the clinical dose ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the background risk of major birth defects is 2 % to 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 % to 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
Data Animal Data In rabbits , an intravenous dose of 0 . 10 mg / kg / day [ ( about equal to the 1 . 5 mg / m2 clinical dose based on body surface area ( BSA ) ] given on Days 6 through 20 of gestation caused maternal toxicity , embryolethality , and reduced fetal body weight .
In the rat , an intravenous dose of 0 . 23 mg / kg / day ( about equal to the 1 . 5 mg / m2 clinical dose based on BSA ) given for 14 days before mating through gestation Day 6 caused fetal resorption , microphthalmia , pre - implant loss , and mild maternal toxicity .
Administration of an intravenous dose of 0 . 10 mg / kg / day ( about half the 1 . 5 mg / m2 clinical dose based on BSA ) given to rats on Days 6 through 17 of gestation caused an increase in post - implantation mortality .
This dose also caused an increase in total fetal malformations .
The most frequent malformations were of the eye ( microphthalmia , anophthalmia , rosette formation of the retina , coloboma of the retina , ectopic orbit ) , brain ( dilated lateral and third ventricles ) , skull , and vertebrae .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of topotecan or its metabolites in human milk or their effects on the breastfed infant or on milk production .
Lactating rats excrete high concentrations of topotecan in milk ( see Data ) .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Topotecan Injection and for 1 week after the last dose .
Data Following intravenous administration of topotecan to lactating rats at a dose of 4 . 72 mg / m2 ( about twice the 1 . 5 mg / m2 clinical dose based on BSA ) , topotecan was excreted into milk at concentrations up to 48 - fold higher than those in plasma .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Topotecan Injection [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception Topotecan can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Topotecan Injection and for 6 months after the last dose .
Males Topotecan may damage spermatozoa , resulting in possible genetic and fetal abnormalities .
Advise males with a female partner of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with Topotecan Injection and for 3 months after the last dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Females Topotecan may have both acute and long - term effects on fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Males Effects on spermatogenesis occurred in animals administered topotecan [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 879 patients with SCLC or another solid tumor who received topotecan in clinical trials , 32 % were aged 65 years and older , while 3 . 8 % were aged 75 years and older .
No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dose of Topotecan Injection for patients with a CLcr of 20 to 39 mL / min [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with CLcr greater than or equal to 40 mL / min .
Insufficient data are available in patients with CLcr less than 20 mL / min to provide a dosage recommendation for Topotecan Injection .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdoses ( up to 10 - fold of the recommended dose ) have occurred in patients receiving intravenous topotecan .
The primary complication of overdosage is myelosuppression .
Elevated hepatic enzymes , mucositis , gastrointestinal toxicity and skin toxicity have occurred with overdosages .
If an overdose is suspected , monitor the patient closely for myelosuppression and institute supportive - care measures as appropriate .
11 DESCRIPTION Topotecan is a semi - synthetic derivative of camptothecin and a topoisomerase inhibitor .
The chemical name for topotecan hydrochloride is ( S ) - 10 - [ ( dimethylamino ) methyl ] - 4 - ethyl - 4 , 9 - dihydroxy - 1 H - pyrano [ 3 ' , 4 ' : 6 , 7 ] indolizino [ 1 , 2 - b ] quinoline - 3 , 14 - ( 4 H , 12 H ) - dione 1 . 25 hydrochloride .
It has the molecular formula C23H23N3O5 ∙ xHCl ( x = 1 . 25 ) and a molecular weight of 467 . 02 .
It is soluble in water and melts with decomposition at 213 ° C to 218 ° C . Topotecan hydrochloride has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Topotecan Injection for intravenous use is supplied as a sterile , non - pyrogenic , clear , yellow to yellow - green solution in single - dose vial at a topotecan free base concentration of 4 mg / 4 mL ( 1 mg / mL ) .
Each mL contains 1 mg topotecan free base ( equivalent to 1 . 11 mg of topotecan hydrochloride ) , 5 mg tartaric acid , NF and water for injection , USP .
It may also contain hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH . The solution pH ranges from 2 . 6 to 3 . 2 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single - strand breaks .
Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I - DNA complex and prevents re - ligation of these single - strand breaks .
The cytotoxicity of topotecan is thought to be due to double - strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis , when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topotecan , topoisomerase I , and DNA .
Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double - strand breaks .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following administration of topotecan at doses of 0 . 5 to 1 . 5 mg / m2 ( 0 . 3 to 1 times the recommended dose ) administered as a 30 - minute infusion , area under the curve ( AUC ) increases approximately proportional with dose .
Distribution Protein binding of topotecan is approximately 35 % .
Elimination The terminal half - life of topotecan is 2 to 3 hours following intravenous administration .
Metabolism Topotecan undergoes a reversible pH - dependent hydrolysis of its pharmacologically active lactone moiety .
At pH ≤ 4 , the lactone is exclusively present , whereas the ring - opened hydroxy - acid form predominates at physiologic pH . Topotecan is metabolized to an N - demethylated metabolite in vitro .
The mean metabolite : parent AUC ratio was about 3 % for total topotecan and topotecan lactone following intravenous administration .
Excretion The overall recovery of total topotecan and its N - desmethyl metabolite in urine and feces over 9 days averaged 73 % ± 2 % following an intravenous dose .
Mean values of 51 % ± 3 % as total topotecan and 3 % ± 1 % as N - desmethyl topotecan were excreted in the urine .
Fecal elimination of total topotecan accounted for 18 % ± 4 % while fecal elimination of N - desmethyl topotecan was 1 . 7 % ± 0 . 6 % .
An O - glucuronidation metabolite of topotecan and N - desmethyl topotecan has been identified in the urine .
Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of topotecan were observed based on age , sex , or hepatic impairment following intravenous administration .
Patients with Renal Impairment Compared to patients with CLcr > 60 mL / min ( calculated by the Cockcroft - Gault method using ideal body weight ) , plasma clearance of topotecan lactone decreased by 33 % in patients with CLcr 40 to 60 mL / min and decreased by 65 % in patients with CLcr 20 to 39 mL / min .
The effect on topotecan pharmacokinetics in patients with CLcr < 20 mL / min is unknown [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies No clinically significant changes in topotecan pharmacokinetics were observed when coadministered cisplatin .
No clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of free platinum were observed in patients coadministered cisplatin with topotecan .
In Vitro Studies Topotecan does not inhibit CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2C8 / 9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E , CYP3A , or CYP4A or dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity testing of topotecan has not been performed .
Topotecan is known to be genotoxic to mammalian cells and is a probable carcinogen .
Topotecan was mutagenic to L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells and clastogenic to cultured human lymphocytes with and without metabolic activation .
It was also clastogenic to mouse bone marrow .
Topotecan did not cause mutations in bacterial cells .
Topotecan given to female rats prior to mating at an intravenous dose of 1 . 4 mg / m2 ( about equal to the 1 . 5 mg / m2 clinical dose based on BSA ) caused superovulation possibly related to inhibition of follicular atresia .
This dose given to pregnant female rats also caused increased pre - implantation loss .
A one month study in dogs given a daily intravenous topotecan dose of 0 . 4 mg / m2 ( about 0 . 25 times the 1 . 5 mg / m2 clinical dose based on BSA ) suggests that treatment may cause an increase in the incidence of multinucleated spermatogonial giant cells in the testes .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Small Cell Lung Cancer The efficacy of topotecan was studied in 426 patients with recurrent or progressive SCLC in a randomized , comparative trial and in 3 single - arm trials .
Randomized Comparative Trial In a randomized , comparative trial , 211 patients were randomized 1 : 1 to received topotecan ( 1 . 5 mg / m2 once daily intravenously for 5 days starting on Day 1 of a 21 - day cycle ) or CAV ( cyclophosphamide 1 , 000 mg / m2 , doxorubicin 45 mg / m2 , vincristine 2 mg administered sequentially on Day 1 of a 21 - day cycle ) .
All patients were considered sensitive to first - line chemotherapy ( responders who then subsequently progressed greater than or equal to 60 days after completion of first - line therapy ) .
A total of 77 % of patients treated with topotecan and 79 % of patients treated with CAV received platinum / etoposide with or without other agents as first - line chemotherapy .
The efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate , response duration , time to progression and overall survival ( OS ) .
The results of the trial did not show statistically significant improvements in response rates , response duration , time to progression , and OS as shown in Table 2 .

[ 2 ] The calculation for duration of response was based on the interval between first response and time to progression .
The median time to response was similar in both arms : topotecan 6 weeks ( 2 . 4 weeks to 3 . 6 months ) versus CAV 6 weeks ( 5 . 1 weeks to 4 . 2 months ) .
Changes on a disease - related symptom scale are presented in Table 3 .
It should be noted that not all patients had all symptoms , nor did all patients respond to all questions .
Each symptom was rated on a 4 - category scale with an improvement defined as a change in 1 category from baseline sustained over 2 cycles .
Limitations in interpretation of the rating scale and responses preclude formal statistical analysis .

Single - Arm Trials Topotecan was also studied in 3 open - label , non - comparative trials ( Studies 014 , 092 and 053 ) in a total of 319 patients with recurrent or progressive SCLC after treatment with first - line chemotherapy .
In all 3 trials , patients were stratified as either sensitive ( responders who then subsequently progressed greater than or equal to 90 days after completion of first - line therapy ) or refractory ( no response to first - line chemotherapy or who responded to first - line therapy and then progressed within 90 days of completing first - line therapy ) .
Response rates ranged from 11 % to 31 % for sensitive patients and 2 % to 7 % for refractory patients .
Median time to progression and median survival were similar in all 3 trials and the comparative trial .
