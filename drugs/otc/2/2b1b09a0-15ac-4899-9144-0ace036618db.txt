7 . 3 Gastrointestinal Toxicity with Solid Oral Dosage Forms of Potassium Chloride Oral glycopyrrolate may worsen gastrointestinal mucosal injury reported with solid oral dosage forms of potassium chloride due to decreased gastric motility and increased transit time , leading to prolonged contact with the gastrointestinal mucosa .
Glycopyrrolate are not recommended in patients taking solid oral dosage forms of potassium chloride .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Renal Impairment : Monitor patients with renal impairment ; if anticholinergic adverse reactions occur , discontinue use .
( 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Over decades of use , there is an absence of published data on orally administered glycopyrrolate in pregnant women , including an absence of any reports of a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal studies , at non - maternally toxic doses of oral glycopyrrolate , there were no adverse developmental effects in rats or rabbits .
A pre - and post - natal development study of oral glycopyrrolate in rats showed a decrease in pup mean bodyweight that recovered post nursing , with no other developmental effects observed ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data At non - maternally toxic doses of oral glycopyrrolate , there were no effects on embryo - fetal development or toxicity in rats or rabbits .
A pre - and post - natal development study of oral glycopyrrolate in rats showed a decrease in pup mean bodyweight that recovered post nursing , with no other developmental effects observed .
In a published reproductive and developmental study , male and female rats were administered glycopyrrolate in the diet at 0 mg / kg / day , 32 . 5 mg / kg / day , 63 mg / kg / day , and 130 mg / kg / day for 3 weeks to 5 weeks and through up to three consecutive litters .
There was no indication of abnormalities in the pups of treated dams .
There was a decreased rate of conception and in survival rate at weaning for all treated animals in a dose - related manner .
Diminished rates of conception may be due to diminished seminal secretion [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of glycopyrrolate in either human or animal milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
As with other anticholinergic drugs , glycopyrrolate may cause suppression of lactation .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for glycopyrrolate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from glycopyrrolate .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients 65 years of age and older may be more sensitive to the anticholinergic adverse reactions of glycopyrrolate leading to complications of urinary retention , bowel obstruction , heat prostration , arrhythmias , delirium , and falls or fractures ; therefore , glycopyrrolate are not recommended in geriatric patients and may be contraindicated in some geriatric patients with underlying medical conditions [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Glycopyrrolate is substantially excreted by the kidney [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Monitor patients with renal impairment for anticholinergic adverse reactions [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
If anticholinergic adverse reactions occur , discontinue glycopyrrolate .
10 OVERDOSAGE Signs and symptoms of glycopyrrolate overdosage are related to excessive anti - muscarinic anticholinergic activity and are generally peripheral ( e . g . , flushing , hyperthermia , tachycardia , ileus , urinary retention , loss of ocular accommodation , and light sensitivity due to mydriasis ) , but central nervous system toxicity ( agitation , seizures , hyperthermia ) may also occur .
If over - exposure occurs , call the Poison Control Center at 1 - 800 - 222 - 1222 for current information on the management of glycopyrrolate poisoning and overdosage .
Management of glycopyrrolate overdosage is based upon presenting signs and symptoms , including close observation for severe or life - threatening complications which may require respiratory and cardiovascular monitoring and support .
Consider administration of activated charcoal and / or use of a reversible anticholinesterase as appropriate or recommended by Poison Control .
