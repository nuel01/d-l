1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Liquid E - Z - PAQUE is indicated for use in single contrast radiographic examinations of the esophagus , stomach , and small bowel to visualize the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract in adult and pediatric patients .
Liquid E - Z - PAQUE is a radiographic contrast agent indicated for use in single contrast radiographic examinations of the esophagus , stomach , and small bowel to visualize the gastrointestinal ( GI ) tract in adult and pediatric patients ( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Adults : Recommended oral dose is 150 mL to 750 mL ( 87 g to 435 g of barium sulfate , respectively ) ( 2 . 1 ) • Pediatric patients : adjust dose based on relative GI volume ( 2 . 1 ) 2 . 1 Recommended Dosage The optimal oral dose of Liquid E - Z - PAQUE will vary depending on the size and anatomy of the patient and the procedure being performed .
The recommended oral dose of Liquid E - Z - PAQUE : • Adults : 150 to 750 mL ( 87 g to 435 g of barium sulfate , respectively ) .
Volumes closer to 150 mL are recommended for examination of the esophagus and stomach and volumes up to 750 mL are recommended for examination of the small bowel • Pediatric Patients : Adjust dose based on GI volume • For examinations of the upper GI tract , administer a volume sufficient to fully distend the esophagus or stomach .
• For small bowel examinations : • Age birth to less than 2 years : 30 mL to 75 mL • Age 2 years to less than 17 years : 75 mL to 480 mL 2 . 2 Administration Instructions • For oral use only • Shake bottle vigorously for 30 seconds prior to oral administration to fully suspend product • Administer undiluted • Ensure patients have nothing by mouth for the following time period prior to the examination : • Neonates and Infants < 3 months                 2 hours • Infants 3 - 12 months                                       3 hours • > 12 months of age                                        4 hours • Discard any unused suspension • Encourage patients to maintain hydration following the barium sulfate procedure 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Liquid E - Z - PAQUE oral suspension : 213 grams of barium sulfate supplied as a suspension ( 60 % w / v ) in a single - dose bottle .
• Oral suspension 213 g barium sulfate ( 60 % w / v ) ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Liquid E - Z - PAQUE is contraindicated in patients with the following conditions : • known or suspected perforation of the GI tract • known obstruction of the GI tract • high risk of GI perforation such as those with a recent GI perforation , acute GI hemorrhage or ischemia , toxic megacolon , severe ileus , post GI surgery or biopsy , acute GI injury or burn , or recent radiotherapy to the pelvis • high risk of aspiration such as those with prior aspiration , tracheo - esophageal fistula , or obtundation • known severe hypersensitivity to barium sulfate or any of the excipients of Liquid E - Z - PAQUE • Known or suspected perforation of the GI tract ( 4 ) • Known obstruction of the GI tract ( 4 ) • Conditions associated with high risk of GI perforation or aspiration ( 4 ) • Known severe hypersensitivity to barium sulfate or any of the excipients of Liquid E - Z - PAQUE ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypersensitivity reactions : Emergency equipment and trained personnel should be immediately available ( 5 . 1 ) • Intra - abdominal barium leakage : May occur in conditions such as GI fistula , ulcer , inflammatory bowel disease , appendicitis or diverticulitis , severe stenosis or obstructing lesions of the GI tract ( 5 . 2 ) • Delayed GI transit and obstruction : Patients should maintain adequate hydration in days following a barium sulfate procedure to avoid obstruction or impaction ( 5 . 3 ) • Aspiration pneumonitis : Patients with history of food aspiration or with swallowing disorders are at increased risk ( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Barium sulfate preparations contain a number of excipients , including natural and artificial flavors and may induce serious hypersensitivity reactions .
The manifestations include hypotension , bronchospasm and other respiratory impairments , dermal reactions including rashes , urticaria and itching .
A history of bronchial asthma , atopy or a previous reaction to a contrast agent may increase the risk for hypersensitivity reactions .
Emergency equipment and trained personnel should be immediately available for treatment of a hypersensitivity reaction .
5 . 2 Intra - abdominal Barium Leakage The use of Liquid E - Z - PAQUE is contraindicated in patients at high risk of perforation of the GI tract [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Administration of Liquid E - Z - PAQUE may result in leakage of barium from the GI tract in the presence of conditions such as carcinomas , GI fistula , inflammatory bowel disease , gastric or duodenal ulcer , appendicitis , diverticulitis , and in patients with a severe stenosis at any level of the GI tract , especially distal to the stomach .
Barium leakage has been associated with peritonitis and granuloma formation .
5 . 3 Delayed Gastrointestinal Transit and Obstruction Orally administered barium sulfate may accumulate proximal to a constricting lesion of the colon , causing obstruction or impaction with development of baroliths ( inspissated barium associated with feces ) and may cause abdominal pain , appendicitis , bowel obstruction , or rarely perforation .
Patients with the following conditions are at higher risk for developing obstruction or baroliths : severe stenosis at any level of the GI tract , impaired GI motility , electrolyte imbalance , dehydration , on a low residue diet , on medications that delay GI motility , constipation , cystic fibrosis or Hirschsprung disease , and the elderly [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 , 8 . 5 ) ] .
To reduce the risk of delayed GI transit and obstruction , patients should maintain adequate hydration following a barium sulfate procedure .
5 . 4 Aspiration Pneumonitis The use of Liquid E - Z - PAQUE is contraindicated in patients at high risk of aspiration [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Oral administration of barium is associated with aspiration pneumonitis , especially in patients with a history of food aspiration or with compromised swallowing mechanism .
Vomiting following oral administration of barium sulfate may lead to aspiration pneumonitis .
In patients at risk for aspiration , begin the procedure with a small ingested volume of Liquid E - Z - PAQUE .
Discontinue administration of Liquid E - Z - PAQUE immediately if aspiration is suspected .
5 . 5 Systemic Embolization Barium sulfate products may occasionally intravasate into the venous drainage of the large bowel and enter the circulation as a " barium embolus " leading to potentially fatal complications which include systemic and pulmonary embolism , disseminated intravascular coagulation , septicemia and prolonged severe hypotension .
Although this complication is exceedingly uncommon after oral administration of barium sulfate suspension , monitor patients for potential intravasation when administering barium sulfate .
5 . 6 Risk with Hereditary Fructose Intolerance Liquid E - Z - PAQUE contains sorbitol which may cause severe symptoms if ingested by patients with hereditary fructose intolerance .
Severe symptoms may include the following : vomiting , hypoglycemia , jaundice , hemorrhage , hepatomegaly , hyperuricemia , and kidney failure .
Before administration of Liquid E - Z - PAQUE assess patients for a history of hereditary fructose intolerance and avoid use in these patients .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified from spontaneous reporting or clinical studies of barium sulfate administered orally .
Because the reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure : • Nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and abdominal cramping • Serious adverse reactions and fatalities include aspiration pneumonitis , barium sulfate impaction , intestinal perforation with consequent peritonitis and granuloma formation , vasovagal and syncopal episodes Common adverse reactions include nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and abdominal cramping ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Bracco Diagnostics Inc at 1 - 800 - 257 - 5181 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Liquid E - Z - PAQUE is not absorbed systemically following oral administration , and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the drug [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Liquid E - Z - PAQUE is not absorbed systemically by the mother following oral administration , and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the infant to Liquid E - Z - PAQUE [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The efficacy of Liquid E - Z - PAQUE in pediatric patients from birth to less than 17 years of age is based on successful opacification of the esophagus , stomach , and small bowel during single contrast radiographic procedures [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
Safety and dosing recommendations in pediatric patients are based on clinical experience [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Liquid E - Z - PAQUE is contraindicated in pediatric patients with tracheo - esophageal fistula .
[ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Pediatric patients with a history of asthma or food allergies may be at increased risk for development of hypersensitivity reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis or Hirschsprung disease for bowel obstruction after use [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] 8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Liquid E - Z - PAQUE do not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
