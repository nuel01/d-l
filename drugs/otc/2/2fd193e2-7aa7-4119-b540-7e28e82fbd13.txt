Rx only Prescribing Information DESCRIPTION ULTRAM ® ER ( tramadol hydrochloride ) is a centrally acting synthetic analgesic in an extended - release formulation .
The chemical name is ( ± ) cis - 2 - [ ( dimethylamino ) methyl ] - 1 - ( 3 - methoxyphenyl ) cyclohexanol hydrochloride .
Its structural formula is : Figure 1 [ MULTIMEDIA ] The molecular weight of tramadol HCl is 299 . 8 .
It is a white , bitter , crystalline and odorless powder that is readily soluble in water and ethanol and has a pKa of 9 . 41 .
The n - octanol / water log partition coefficient ( logP ) is 1 . 35 at pH 7 .
ULTRAM ER tablets contain 100 , 200 or 300 mg of tramadol HCl in an extended - release formulation .
The tablets are white to off - white in color and contain the inactive ingredients ethylcellulose , dibutyl sebacate , polyvinyl pyrrolidone , sodium stearyl fumarate , colloidal silicon dioxide , and polyvinyl alcohol .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action ULTRAM ER is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic .
Although its mode of action is not completely understood , from animal tests , at least two complementary mechanisms appear applicable : binding of parent and M1 metabolite to µ - opioid receptors and weak inhibition of reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin .
Opioid activity is due to both low affinity binding of the parent compound and higher affinity binding of the O - demethylated metabolite M1 to µ - opioid receptors .
In animal models , M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in µ - opioid binding .
Tramadol - induced analgesia is only partially antagonized by the opiate antagonist naloxone in several animal tests .
The relative contribution of both tramadol and M1 to human analgesia is dependent upon the plasma concentrations of each compound .
Tramadol has been shown to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in vitro , as have some other opioid analgesics .
These mechanisms may contribute independently to the overall analgesic profile of tramadol .
The relationship between exposure of tramadol and M1 and efficacy has not been evaluated in the ULTRAM ER clinical studies .
Apart from analgesia , tramadol administration may produce a constellation of symptoms ( including dizziness , somnolence , nausea , constipation , sweating and pruritus ) similar to that of other opioids .
In contrast to morphine , tramadol has not been shown to cause histamine release .
At therapeutic doses , tramadol has no effect on heart rate , left - ventricular function or cardiac index .
Orthostatic hypotension has been observed .
Pharmacokinetics The analgesic activity of tramadol is due to both parent drug and the M1 metabolite .
ULTRAM ER is administered as a racemate and both the [ - ] and [ + ] forms of both tramadol and M1 are detected in the circulation .
The pharmacokinetics of ULTRAM ER are approximately dose - proportional over a 100 - 400 mg dose range in healthy subjects .
The observed tramadol AUC values for the 400 - mg dose were 26 % higher than predicted based on the AUC values for the 200 - mg dose .
The clinical significance of this finding has not been studied and is not known .
Absorption In healthy subjects , the bioavailability of a ULTRAM ER 200 mg tablet relative to a 50 mg every six hours dosing regimen of the immediate - release dosage form ( ULTRAM ) was approximately 85 - 90 % .
Consistent with the extended - release nature of the formulation , there is a lag time in drug absorption following ULTRAM ER administration .
The mean peak plasma concentrations of tramadol and M1 after administration of ULTRAM ER tablets to healthy volunteers are attained at about 12 h and 15 h , respectively , after dosing ( see Table 1 and Figure 2 ) .
Following administration of the ULTRAM ER , steady - state plasma concentrations of both tramadol and M1 are achieved within four days with once daily dosing .
The mean ( % CV ) pharmacokinetic parameter values for ULTRAM ER 200 mg administered once daily and tramadol HCl immediate - release ( ULTRAM ) 50 mg administered every six hours are provided in Table 1 .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Food Effects After a single dose administration of 200 mg ULTRAM ER tablet with a high fat meal , the Cmax and AUC0 - ∞ of tramadol decreased 28 % and 16 % , respectively , compared to fasting conditions .
Mean Tmax was increased by 3 hr ( from 14 hr under fasting conditions to 17 hr under fed conditions ) .
While ULTRAM ER may be taken without regard to food , it is recommended that it be taken in a consistent manner .
Distribution The volume of distribution of tramadol was 2 . 6 and 2 . 9 liters / kg in male and female subjects , respectively , following a 100 - mg intravenous dose .
The binding of tramadol to human plasma proteins is approximately 20 % and binding also appears to be independent of concentration up to 10 µg / mL .
Saturation of plasma protein binding occurs only at concentrations outside the clinically relevant range .
Metabolism Tramadol is extensively metabolized after oral administration .
The major metabolic pathways appear to be N – ( mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 ) and O – ( mediated by CYP2D6 ) demethylation and glucuronidation or sulfation in the liver .
One metabolite ( O - desmethyl tramadol , denoted M1 ) is pharmacologically active in animal models .
Formation of M1 is dependent on CYP2D6 and as such is subject to inhibition , which may affect the therapeutic response ( see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ) .
Elimination Tramadol is eliminated primarily through metabolism by the liver and the metabolites are eliminated primarily by the kidneys .
Approximately 30 % of the dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug , whereas 60 % of the dose is excreted as metabolites .
The remainder is excreted either as unidentified or as unextractable metabolites .
The mean terminal plasma elimination half - lives of racemic tramadol and racemic M1 after administration of ULTRAM ER are approximately 7 . 9 and 8 . 8 hours , respectively .
Special Populations Renal Impaired renal function results in a decreased rate and extent of excretion of tramadol and its active metabolite , M1 .
The pharmacokinetics of tramadol were studied in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment after receiving multiple doses of ULTRAM ER 100 mg .
There is no consistent trend observed for tramadol exposure related to renal function in patients with mild ( CLcr : 50 - 80 mL / min ) or moderate ( CLcr : 30 - 50 mL / min ) renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function .
However , exposure of M1 increased 20 - 40 % with increased severity of the renal impairment ( from normal to mild and moderate ) .
ULTRAM ER has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) .
The limited availability of dose strengths of ULTRAM ER does not permit the dosing flexibility required for safe use in patients with severe renal impairment .
Therefore , ULTRAM ER should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment ( see PRECAUTIONS , Use in Renal and Hepatic Disease and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
The total amount of tramadol and M1 removed during a 4 - hour dialysis period is less than 7 % of the administered dose .
Hepatic Pharmacokinetics of tramadol was studied in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment after receiving multiple doses of ULTRAM ER 100 mg .
The exposure of ( + ) - and ( - ) - tramadol was similar in mild and moderate hepatic impairment patients in comparison to patients with normal hepatic function .
However , exposure of ( + ) - and ( - ) - M1 decreased ~ 50 % with increased severity of the hepatic impairment ( from normal to mild and moderate ) .
The pharmacokinetics of tramadol after the administration of ULTRAM ER has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
After the administration of tramadol immediate - release tablets to patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver , tramadol area under the plasma concentration time curve was larger and the tramadol and M1 half - lives were longer than subjects with normal hepatic function .
The limited availability of dose strengths of ULTRAM ER does not permit the dosing flexibility required for safe use in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
Therefore , ULTRAM ER should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see PRECAUTIONS , Use in Renal and Hepatic Disease and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Geriatric The effect of age on the absorption of tramadol from ULTRAM ER in patients over the age of 65 years has not been studied and is unknown ( see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Gender Based on pooled multiple - dose pharmacokinetics studies for ULTRAM ER in 166 healthy subjects ( 111 males and 55 females ) , the dose - normalized AUC values for tramadol were somewhat higher in females than in males .
There was a considerable degree of overlap in values between male and female groups .
Dosage adjustment based on gender is not recommended .
Drug Interactions The formation of the active metabolite , M1 , is mediated by CYP2D6 .
Approximately 7 % of the population has reduced activity of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme of cytochrome P - 450 .
Based on a population PK analysis of Phase I studies with immediate - release tablets in healthy subjects , concentrations of tramadol were approximately 20 % higher in " poor metabolizers " versus " extensive metabolizers , " while M1 concentrations were 40 % lower .
In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that inhibitors of CYP2D6 ( fluoxetine , norfluoxetine , amitriptyline , and quinidine ) inhibit the metabolism of tramadol to various degrees , suggesting that concomitant administration of these compounds could result in increases in tramadol concentrations and decreased concentrations of M1 .
The full pharmacological impact of these alterations in terms of either efficacy or safety is unknown .
Tramadol is also metabolized by CYP3A4 .
Administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors , such as ketoconazole and erythromycin , or inducers , such as rifampin and St . John ' s Wort , with ULTRAM ER may affect the metabolism of tramadol leading to altered tramadol exposure ( see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ) .
Quinidine Tramadol is metabolized to M1 by CYP2D6 .
A study was conducted to examine the effect of quinidine , a selective inhibitor of CYP2D6 , on the pharmacokinetics of tramadol by administering 200 mg quinidine two hours before the administration of ULTRAM ER 100 mg .
The results demonstrated that the exposure of tramadol increased 50 - 60 % and the exposure of M1 decreased 50 - 60 % ( see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ) .
In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tramadol has no effect on quinidine metabolism .
Carbamazepine Carbamazepine , a CYP3A4 inducer , increases tramadol metabolism .
Patients taking carbamazepine may have a significantly reduced analgesic effect of tramadol .
Because of the seizure risk associated with tramadol , concomitant administration of ULTRAM ER and carbamazepine is not recommended ( see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ) .
Cimetidine Concomitant administration of tramadol immediate - release tablets with cimetidine does not result in clinically significant changes in tramadol pharmacokinetics .
No alteration of the ULTRAM ER dosage regimen with cimetidine is recommended .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL STUDIES ULTRAM ER was studied in patients with chronic , moderate to moderately severe pain due to osteoarthritis and / or low back pain in four 12 - week , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials .
To qualify for inclusion into these studies , patients were required to have moderate to moderately severe pain as defined by a pain intensity score of ≥ 40 mm , off previous medications , on a 0 – 100 mm visual analog scale ( VAS ) .
Adequate evidence of efficacy was demonstrated in the following two studies : In one 12 - week randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study , patients with moderate to moderately severe pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee and / or hip were administered doses from 100 mg to 400 mg daily .
Treatment was initiated at 100 mg QD for four days then increased by 100 mg per day increments every five days to the randomized fixed dose .
Between 51 % and 59 % of patients in the ULTRAM ER treatment groups completed the study and 56 % of patients in the placebo group completed the study .
Discontinuations due to adverse events were more common in the ULTRAM ER 200 mg , 300 mg and 400 mg treatment groups ( 20 % , 27 % , and 30 % of discontinuations , respectively ) compared to 14 % of the patients treated with ULTRAM ER 100 mg and 20 % of patients treated with placebo .
Pain , as assessed by the WOMAC Pain subscale , was measured at 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 weeks and change from baseline assessed .
A responder analysis based on the percent change in WOMAC Pain subscale demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in pain for the 100 mg and 200 mg treatment groups compared to placebo ( see Figure 3 ) .
Figure 3 [ MULTIMEDIA ] In one 12 - week randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled flexible - dosing trial of ULTRAM ER in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee , patients titrated to an average daily ULTRAM ER dose of approximately 270 mg / day .
Forty - nine percent of patients randomized to ULTRAM ER completed the study , while 52 % of patients randomized to placebo completed the study .
Most of the early discontinuations in the ULTRAM ER treatment group were due to adverse events , accounting for 27 % of the early discontinuations in contrast to 7 % of the discontinuations from the placebo group .
Thirty - four percent of the placebo - treated patients discontinued the study due to lack of efficacy compared to 15 % of ULTRAM ER - treated patients .
The ULTRAM ER group demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the mean VAS score , and a statistically significant difference in the responder rate , based on the percent change from baseline in the VAS score , measured at 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks , between patients receiving ULTRAM ER and placebo ( see Figure 4 ) .
Figure 4 [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] INDICATIONS AND USAGE ULTRAM ER is indicated for the management of moderate to moderately severe chronic pain in adults who require around - the - clock treatment of their pain for an extended period of time .
CONTRAINDICATIONS ULTRAM ER should not be administered to patients who have previously demonstrated hypersensitivity to tramadol , any other component of this product or opioids .
ULTRAM ER is contraindicated in any situation where opioids are contraindicated , including acute intoxication with any of the following : alcohol , hypnotics , narcotics , centrally acting analgesics , opioids or psychotropic drugs .
ULTRAM ER may worsen central nervous system and respiratory depression in these patients .
WARNINGS Seizure Risk Seizures have been reported in patients receiving tramadol within the recommended dosage range .
Spontaneous post - marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of tramadol above the recommended range .
Concomitant use of tramadol increases the seizure risk in patients taking : • Selective serotonin re - uptake inhibitors ( SSRI antidepressants or anorectics ) , • Tricyclic antidepressants ( TCAs ) , and other tricyclic compounds ( e . g . , cyclobenzaprine , promethazine , etc . ) , or • Other opioids .
Administration of tramadol may enhance the seizure risk in patients taking : • MAO inhibitors ( see also WARNINGS , Use with MAO Inhibitors ) , • Neuroleptics , or • Other drugs that reduce the seizure threshold .
Risk of convulsions may also increase in patients with epilepsy , those with a history of seizures , or in patients with a recognized risk for seizure ( such as head trauma , metabolic disorders , alcohol and drug withdrawal , CNS infections ) .
In tramadol overdose , naloxone administration may increase the risk of seizure .
Suicide Risk • Do not prescribe ULTRAM ER for patients who are suicidal or addiction - prone .
• Prescribe ULTRAM ER with caution for patients taking tranquilizers or antidepressant drugs and patients who use alcohol in excess .
• Tell your patients not to exceed the recommended dose and to limit their intake of alcohol .
Serotonin Syndrome Risk The development of a potentially life - threatening serotonin syndrome may occur with the use of tramadol products , including ULTRAM ER , particularly with concomitant use of serotonergic drugs such as SSRIs , SNRIs , TCAs , MAOIs and triptans , with drugs which impair metabolism of serotonin ( including MAOIs ) , and with drugs which impair metabolism of tramadol ( CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors ) .
This may occur within the recommended dose .
( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics ) .
Serotonin syndrome may include mental - status changes ( e . g . , agitation , hallucinations , coma ) , autonomic instability ( e . g . , tachycardia , labile blood pressure , hyperthermia ) , neuromuscular aberrations ( e . g . , hyperreflexia , incoordination ) and / or gastrointestinal symptoms ( e . g . , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ) .
Tramadol products in excessive doses , either alone or in combination with other CNS depressants , including alcohol , are a major cause of drug - related deaths .
Fatalities within the first hour of overdosage are not uncommon .
Tramadol should not be taken in doses higher than those recommended by the physician .
The judicious prescribing of tramadol is essential to the safe use of this drug .
With patients who are depressed or suicidal , consideration should be given to the use of non - narcotic analgesics .
Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of tramadol products and alcohol because of potentially serious CNS - additive effects of these agents .
Because of its added depressant effects , tramadol should be prescribed with caution for those patients whose medical condition requires the concomitant administration of sedatives , tranquilizers , muscle relaxants , antidepressants , or other CNS - depressant drugs .
Patients should be advised of the additive depressant effects of these combinations .
Many of the tramadol - related deaths have occurred in patients with previous histories of emotional disturbances or suicidal ideation or attempts as well as histories of misuse of tranquilizers , alcohol , and other CNS - active drugs .
Some deaths have occurred as a consequence of the accidental ingestion of excessive quantities of tramadol alone or in combination with other drugs .
Patients taking tramadol should be warned not to exceed the dose recommended by their physician .
Anaphylactoid Reactions Serious and rarely fatal anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients receiving therapy with tramadol .
When these events do occur it is often following the first dose .
Other reported allergic reactions include pruritus , hives , bronchospasm , angioedema , toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens - Johnson syndrome .
Patients with a history of anaphylactoid reactions to codeine and other opioids may be at increased risk and therefore should not receive ULTRAM ER ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Respiratory Depression Administer ULTRAM ER cautiously in patients at risk for respiratory depression .
In these patients alternative non - opioid analgesics should be considered .
When large doses of tramadol are administered with anesthetic medications or alcohol , respiratory depression may result .
Respiratory depression should be treated as an overdose .
If naloxone is to be administered , use cautiously because it may precipitate seizures ( see WARNINGS , Seizure Risk and OVERDOSAGE ) .
Interaction With Central Nervous System ( CNS ) Depressants ULTRAM ER should be used with caution and in reduced dosages when administered to patients receiving CNS depressants such as alcohol , opioids , anesthetic agents , narcotics , phenothiazines , tranquilizers or sedative hypnotics .
ULTRAM ER increases the risk of CNS and respiratory depression in these patients .
Increased Intracranial Pressure or Head Trauma ULTRAM ER should be used with caution in patients with increased intracranial pressure or head injury .
The respiratory depressant effects of opioids include carbon dioxide retention and secondary elevation of cerebrospinal fluid pressure , and may be markedly exaggerated in these patients .
Additionally , pupillary changes ( miosis ) from tramadol may obscure the existence , extent , or course of intracranial pathology .
Clinicians should also maintain a high index of suspicion for adverse drug reaction when evaluating altered mental status in these patients if they are receiving ULTRAM ER .
( see WARNINGS , Respiratory Depression . )
Use in Ambulatory Patients ULTRAM ER may impair the mental and or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery .
The patient using this drug should be cautioned accordingly .
Use With MAO Inhibitors and Serotonin Re - uptake Inhibitors Use ULTRAM ER with great caution in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors .
Animal studies have shown increased deaths with combined administration .
Concomitant use of ULTRAM ER with MAO inhibitors or SSRIs increases the risk of adverse events , including seizure and serotonin syndrome .
Withdrawal Withdrawal symptoms may occur if ULTRAM ER is discontinued abruptly .
These symptoms may include : anxiety , sweating , insomnia , rigors , pain , nausea , tremors , diarrhea , upper respiratory symptoms , piloerection , and rarely hallucinations .
Clinical experience suggests that withdrawal symptoms may be reduced by tapering ULTRAM ER .
Misuse , Abuse and Diversion of Opioids Tramadol is an opioid agonist of the morphine - type .
Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people with addiction disorders and are subject to criminal diversion .
Tramadol can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists , legal or illicit .
This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing ULTRAM ER in situations where the physician or pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse , abuse , or diversion .
ULTRAM ER could be abused by crushing , chewing , snorting , or injecting the dissolved product .
These practices will result in the uncontrolled delivery of the opioid and pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in overdose and death ( see WARNINGS and DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION ) .
Concerns about abuse , addiction , and diversion should not prevent the proper management of pain .
The development of addiction to opioid analgesics in properly managed patients with pain has been reported to be rare .
However , data are not available to establish the true incidence of addiction in chronic pain patients .
Healthcare professionals should contact their State Professional Licensing Board or State Controlled Substances Authority for information on how to prevent and detect abuse or diversion of this product .
Interactions with Alcohol and Drugs of Abuse Tramadol may be expected to have additive effects when used in conjunction with alcohol , other opioids , or illicit drugs that cause central nervous system depression .
DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION ULTRAM ® ER is a mu - agonist opioid .
Tramadol , like other opioids used in analgesia , can be abused and is subject to criminal diversion .
Drug addiction is characterized by compulsive use , use for non - medical purposes , and continued use despite harm or risk of harm .
Drug addiction is a treatable disease , utilizing a multi - disciplinary approach , but relapse is common .
" Drug - seeking " behavior is very common in addicts and drug abusers .
Drug - seeking tactics include emergency calls or visits near the end of office hours , refusal to undergo appropriate examination , testing or referral , repeated " loss " of prescriptions , tampering with prescriptions and reluctance to provide prior medical records or contact information for other treating physician ( s ) .
" Doctor shopping " to obtain additional prescriptions is common among drug abusers and people suffering from untreated addiction .
Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance .
Physicians should be aware that addiction may not be accompanied by concurrent tolerance and symptoms of physical dependence in all addicts .
In addition , abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for non - medical purposes , often in combination with other psychoactive substances .
ULTRAM ER , like other opioids , may be diverted for non - medical use .
Careful record - keeping of prescribing information , including quantity , frequency , and renewal requests is strongly advised .
Proper assessment of the patient , proper prescribing practices , periodic re - evaluation of therapy , and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs .
ULTRAM ER is intended for oral use only .
The crushed tablet poses a hazard of overdose and death .
This risk is increased with concurrent abuse of alcohol and other substances .
With parenteral abuse , the tablet excipients can be expected to result in local tissue necrosis , infection , pulmonary granulomas , and increased risk of endocarditis and valvular heart injury .
Parenteral drug abuse is commonly associated with transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV .
Risk of Overdosage Serious potential consequences of overdosage with ULTRAM ER are central nervous system depression , respiratory depression and death .
In treating an overdose , primary attention should be given to maintaining adequate ventilation along with general supportive treatment ( see OVERDOSAGE ) .
PRECAUTIONS Acute Abdominal Condition The administration of ULTRAM ER may complicate the clinical assessment of patients with acute abdominal conditions .
Use in Renal and Hepatic Disease Impaired renal function results in a decreased rate and extent of excretion of tramadol and its active metabolite , M1 .
ULTRAM ER has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) .
The limited availability of dose strengths and once daily dosing of ULTRAM ER do not permit the dosing flexibility required for safe use in patients with severe renal impairment .
Therefore , ULTRAM ER should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Metabolism of tramadol and M1 is reduced in patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver .
The pharmacokinetics of ULTRAM ER has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
The limited availability of dose strengths and once daily dosing of ULTRAM ER do not permit the dosing flexibility required for safe use in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
Therefore , ULTRAM ER should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS • Patients should be informed that ULTRAM ER is for oral use only and should be swallowed whole .
The tablets should not be chewed , crushed , or split .
• Patients should be informed that ULTRAM ER may cause seizures and / or serotonin syndrome with concomitant use of serotonergic agents ( including SSRIs , SNRIs , and triptans ) or drugs that significantly reduce the metabolic clearance of tramadol .
• Patients should be informed that ULTRAM ER may impair mental or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery .
• Patients should be informed that ULTRAM ER should not be taken with alcohol containing beverages .
• Patients should be informed that ULTRAM ER should be used with caution when taking medications such as tranquilizers , hypnotics or other opiate containing analgesics .
• Female patients should be instructed to inform the prescriber if they are pregnant , think they might become pregnant , or are trying to become pregnant ( see PRECAUTIONS , Labor and Delivery ) .
• Patients should be educated regarding the single - dose and 24 - hour dosing regimen , as exceeding these recommendations can result in respiratory depression , seizures or death .
Use in Drug and Alcohol Addiction ULTRAM ER is an opioid with no approved use in the management of addictive disorders .
Its proper usage in individuals with drug or alcohol dependence , either active or in remission , is for the management of pain requiring opioid analgesia .
Drug Interactions CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors : Concomitant administration of CYP2D6 and / or CYP3A4 inhibitors ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics ) , such as quinidine , fluoxetine , paroxetine and amitriptyline ( CYP2D6 inhibitors ) , and ketoconazole and erythromycin ( CYP3A4 inhibitors ) , may reduce metabolic clearance of tramadol increasing the risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome .
Serotonergic Drugs : There have been postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of tramadol and SSRIs / SNRIs or MAOIs and α2 - adrenergic blockers .
Caution is advised when ULTRAM ER is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems , such as SSRIs , MAOIs , triptans , linezolid ( an antibiotic which is a reversible non - selective MAOI ) , lithium , or St . John ' s Wort .
If concomitant treatment of ULTRAM ER with a drug affecting the serotonergic neurotransmitter system is clinically warranted , careful observation of the patient is advised , particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases ( see Warnings , Serotonin Syndrome Risk ) .
Triptans : Based on the mechanism of action of tramadol and the potential for serotonin syndrome , caution is advised when ULTRAM ER is coadministered with a triptan .
If concomitant treatment of ULTRAM ER with a triptan is clinically warranted , careful observation of the patient is advised , particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases ( see WARNINGS , Serotonin Syndrome Risk ) .
Use With Carbamazepine Patients taking carbamazepine , a CYP3A4 inducer , may have a significantly reduced analgesic effect of tramadol .
Because carbamazepine increases tramadol metabolism and because of the seizure risk associated with tramadol , concomitant administration of ULTRAM ER and carbamazepine is not recommended .
Use With Quinidine Coadministration of quinidine with ULTRAM ER resulted in a 50 - 60 % increase in tramadol exposure and a 50 - 60 % decrease in M1 exposure ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Drug Interactions ) .
The clinical consequences of these findings are unknown .
Use With Digoxin and Warfarin Post - marketing surveillance of tramadol has revealed rare reports of digoxin toxicity and alteration of warfarin effect , including elevation of prothrombin times .
Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Tramadol In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that concomitant administration with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as fluoxetine , paroxetine , and amitriptyline could result in some inhibition of the metabolism of tramadol .
Administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors , such as ketoconazole and erythromycin , or inducers , such as rifampin and St . John ' s Wort , with ULTRAM ER may affect the metabolism of tramadol leading to altered tramadol exposure .
Potential for Tramadol to Affect Other Drugs In vitro drug interaction studies in human liver microsomes indicate that tramadol has no effect on quinidine metabolism .
In vitro studies indicate that tramadol is unlikely to inhibit the CYP3A4 - mediated metabolism of other drugs when administered concomitantly at therapeutic doses .
Tramadol is a mild inducer of selected drug metabolism pathways measured in animals .
CARCINOGENESIS , MUTAGENESIS , IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY No carcinogenic effect of tramadol was observed in p53 ( + / – ) - heterozygous mice at oral doses up to 150 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 - fold maximum daily human dose [ MDHD ] of 400 mg / day for a 60 kg adult based on body surface conversion ) for 26 weeks and in rats at oral doses up to 75 mg / kg / day for males and 100 mg / kg / day for females ( approximately 2 - fold MDHD ) for two years .
However , the excessive decrease in body weight gain observed in the rat study might have reduced their sensitivity to any potential carcinogenic effect of the drug .
Tramadol was not mutagenic in the following assays : a bacterial reverse mutation assay using Salmonella and E . coli , a mouse lymphoma assay ( in the absence of metabolic activation ) , and a bone marrow micronucleus test in mice .
Mutagenic results occurred in the presence of metabolic activation in the mouse lymphoma assay .
Overall , the weight of evidence from these tests indicates that tramadol does not pose a genotoxic risk to humans .
No effects on fertility were observed for tramadol at oral dose levels up to 50 mg / kg / day in male and female rats ( approximately equivalent to MDHD ) .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category C Tramadol was not teratogenic at oral dose levels up to 50 mg / kg / day ( approximately equivalent to MDHD ) in rats and 100 mg / kg ( approximately 5 - fold MDHD ) in rabbits during organogenesis .
However , embryo - fetal lethality , reductions in fetal weight and skeletal ossification , and increased supernumerary ribs were observed at a maternal toxic dose of 140 mg / kg in mice ( approximately 2 - fold MDHD ) , 80 mg / kg in rats ( 2 - fold MDHD ) or 300 mg / kg in rabbits ( approximately 15 - fold MDHD ) .
Non - teratogenic Effects Tramadol caused a reduction in neonatal body weight and survival at an oral dose of 80 mg / kg ( approximately 2 - fold MDHD ) when rats were treated during late gestation throughout lactation period .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
ULTRAM ER should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Neonatal seizures , neonatal withdrawal syndrome , fetal death and still birth have been reported during post - marketing reports with tramadol HCl immediate - release products .
Labor and Delivery ULTRAM ER should not be used in pregnant women prior to or during labor unless the potential benefits outweigh the risks .
Safe use in pregnancy has not been established .
Chronic use during pregnancy may lead to physical dependence and post - partum withdrawal symptoms in the newborn ( see DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION ) .
Tramadol has been shown to cross the placenta .
The mean ratio of serum tramadol in the umbilical veins compared to maternal veins was 0 . 83 for 40 women treated with tramadol HCl during labor .
The effect of ULTRAM ER , if any , on the later growth , development , and functional maturation of the child is unknown .
Nursing Mothers ULTRAM ER is not recommended for obstetrical preoperative medication or for post - delivery analgesia in nursing mothers because its safety in infants and newborns has not been studied .
Following a single IV 100 - mg dose of tramadol , the cumulative excretion in breast milk within sixteen hours postdose was 100 µg of tramadol ( 0 . 1 % of the maternal dose ) and 27 µg of M1 .
Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of ULTRAM ER in patients under 18 years of age have not been established .
The use of ULTRAM ER in the pediatric population is not recommended .
Geriatric Use Nine - hundred - one elderly ( 65 years of age or older ) subjects were exposed to ULTRAM ER in clinical trials .
Of those subjects , 156 were 75 years of age and older .
In general , higher incidence rates of adverse events were observed for patients older than 65 years of age compared with patients 65 years and younger , particularly for the following adverse events : constipation , fatigue , weakness , postural hypotension and dyspepsia .
For this reason , ULTRAM ER should be used with great caution in patients older than 75 years of age ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
ADVERSE REACTIONS ULTRAM ER was administered to a total of 3108 patients during studies conducted in the U . S .
These included four double - blind studies in patients with osteoarthritis and / or chronic low back pain and one open - label study in patients with chronic non - malignant pain .
A total of 901 patients were 65 years or older .
The frequency of adverse events generally7 increased with doses from 100 mg to 400 mg in the two pooled , twelve - week , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled studies in patients with chronic non - malignant pain ( see Table 2 ) .

Deaths due to overdose have been reported with abuse and misuse of tramadol by ingesting , inhaling , or injecting the crushed tablets .
Review of case reports has indicated that the risk of fatal overdose is further increased when tramadol is abused concurrently with alcohol or other CNS depressants , including other opioids .
In the treatment of tramadol overdosage , primary attention should be given to the re - establishment of a patent airway and institution of assisted or controlled ventilation .
Supportive measures ( including oxygen and vasopressors ) should be employed in the management of circulatory shock and pulmonary edema accompanying overdose as indicated .
Cardiac arrest or arrhythmias may require cardiac massage or defibrillation .
While naloxone will reverse some , but not all , symptoms caused by overdosage with tramadol , the risk of seizures is also increased with naloxone administration .
In animals convulsions following the administration of toxic doses of ULTRAM ER could be suppressed with barbiturates or benzodiazepines but were increased with naloxone .
Naloxone administration did not change the lethality of an overdose in mice .
Hemodialysis is not expected to be helpful in an overdose because it removes less than 7 % of the administered dose in a 4 - hour dialysis period .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ULTRAM ER should not be used in patients with : • creatinine clearance less than 30 mL / min , • severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) ( See PRECAUTIONS , Use in Renal and Hepatic Disease ) .
ULTRAM ER must be swallowed whole and must not be chewed , crushed , or split ( see WARNINGS , Misuse , Abuse and Diversion of Opioids and DRUG ABUSE AND ADDICTION ) .
Adults ( 18 years of age and over ) Patients Not Currently on Tramadol Immediate - Release Products For patients not currently treated with tramadol immediate - release ( IR ) products , ULTRAM ER should be initiated at a dose of 100 mg once daily and titrated up as necessary by 100 - mg increments every five days to relief of pain and depending upon tolerability .
ULTRAM ER should not be administered at a dose exceeding 300 mg per day .
Patients Currently on Tramadol Immediate - Release Products For patients maintained on tramadol IR products , calculate the 24 - hour tramadol IR dose and initiate a total daily dose of ULTRAM ER rounded down to the next lowest 100 mg increment .
The dose may subsequently be individualized according to patient need .
Due to limitations in flexibility of dose selection with ULTRAM ER , some patients maintained on tramadol IR products may not be able to convert to ULTRAM ER .
ULTRAM ER should not be administered at a dose exceeding 300 mg per day .
The concomitant use of ULTRAM ER with other tramadol products is not recommended ( see WARNINGS ) .
Individualization of Dose Good pain management practice dictates that the dose be individualized according to patient need using the lowest beneficial dose .
Start at the lowest possible dose and titrate upward as tolerated to achieve an adequate effect .
Clinical studies of ULTRAM ER have not demonstrated a clinical benefit at a total daily dose exceeding 300 mg .
In general , dosing of an elderly patient ( over 65 years of age ) should be initiated cautiously , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
ULTRAM ER should be administered with even greater caution in patients over 75 years , due to the greater frequency of adverse events seen in this population .
