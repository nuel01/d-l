8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary TUKYSA is used in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine .
Refer to the Full Prescribing Information of trastuzumab and capecitabine for pregnancy information .
Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action , TUKYSA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available human data on TUKYSA use in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of tucatinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryo - fetal mortality , reduced fetal weight and fetal abnormalities at maternal exposures ≥ 1 . 3 times the human exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended dose ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % - 4 % and 15 % - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In pilot embryo - fetal development studies , pregnant rats and rabbits received oral doses of tucatinib up to 150 mg / kg / day during the period of organogenesis .
In rats , oral administration of tucatinib resulted in maternal toxicity ( body weight loss , reduced body weight gain , low food consumption ) at doses ≥ 90 mg / kg / day .
Fetal effects included reduced number of live fetuses , decreased fetal weight , and fetal abnormalities ( increase in skeletal variations , incomplete ossification ) at ≥ 90 mg / kg / day ( approximately 3 . 5 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC ) .
In rabbits , oral administration of tucatinib resulted in increased resorptions , decreased percentages of live fetuses , and skeletal , visceral , and external malformations in fetuses at doses ≥ 90 mg / kg / day ( 1 . 3 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC ) .
Fetal abnormalities included domed head , brain dilation , incomplete ossification of frontal and parietal bones , and a hole in the parietal bone .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary TUKYSA is used in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Tucatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of HER2 .
In vitro , tucatinib inhibits phosphorylation of HER2 and HER3 , resulting in inhibition of downstream MAPK and AKT signaling and cell proliferation , and showed anti - tumor activity in HER2 expressing tumor cells .
In vivo , tucatinib inhibited the growth of HER2 expressing tumors .
The combination of tucatinib and trastuzumab showed increased anti - tumor activity in vitro and in vivo compared to either drug alone .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure Response Relationship Tucatinib exposure - response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamics response have not been fully characterized .
Cardiac Electrophysiology No large mean increase in QTc ( i . e . , > 20 ms ) was detected following treatment with TUKYSA at the recommended dose of 300 mg taken orally twice daily .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Tucatinib AUC0 - INF and Cmax increased proportionally over a dosage range from 50 mg to 300 mg ( 0 . 17 to 1 times the approved recommended dosage ) .
Time to steady state was approximately 4 days .
Steady - state pharmacokinetic parameters following administration of TUKYSA 300 mg twice daily for 7 days in patients with mBC and mCRC are described in Table 9 .
The geometric mean ( CV % ) tucatinib AUC accumulation ratios ranged from 2 . 0 ( 26 ) fold to 2 . 5 ( 28 ) fold .

Effects of Food Following administration of a single oral dose of TUKYSA in 11 subjects after a high - fat meal ( approximately 58 % fat , 26 % carbohydrate , and 16 % protein ) , the mean AUC0 - INF increased by 1 . 5 - fold , the Tmax shifted from 1 . 5 hours to 4 hours , and Cmax was unaltered .
The effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of tucatinib was not clinically meaningful .
Distribution The geometric mean ( CV % ) apparent volume of distribution of tucatinib at steady - state were 903 ( 42 ) L and 829 ( 21 ) L in patients with mBC and mCRC , respectively .
The plasma protein binding was 97 . 1 % at clinically relevant concentrations .
At steady - state , concentrations of tucatinib and its metabolite ONT - 993 in the cerebrospinal fluid were comparable to unbound plasma concentrations .
Elimination At steady - state , tucatinib effective half - life was approximately 11 . 9 hours and geometric mean ( CV % ) apparent clearance was 53 ( 43 ) L / h in patients with mBC .
Tucatinib effective half - life was approximately 16 . 4 hours and geometric mean ( CV % ) apparent clearance was 89 ( 49 ) L / h in patients with mCRC .
Metabolism Tucatinib is metabolized primarily by CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent via CYP3A .
Excretion Following a single oral dose of 300 mg radiolabeled tucatinib , approximately 86 % of the total radiolabeled dose was recovered in feces ( 16 % of the administered dose as unchanged tucatinib ) and 4 . 1 % in urine with an overall total recovery of 90 % within 13 days post - dose .
In plasma , approximately 76 % of the plasma radioactivity was unchanged , 19 % was attributed to identified metabolites , and approximately 5 % was unassigned .
Specific Populations Age ( 18 - 77 years ) , albumin ( 19 to 52 g / L ) , creatinine clearance ( CLcr : 60 to 89 mL / min ( n = 63 ) ; CLcr 30 to 59 mL / min ( n = 6 ) ) , body weight ( 41 to 146 kg ) , sex ( male ( n = 170 ) , female ( n = 113 ) ) and race ( White ( n = 205 ) , Black ( n = 37 ) , or Asian ( n = 25 ) ) did not have a clinically meaningful effect on tucatinib exposure .
Renal Impairment No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of tucatinib were observed in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr : 30 to 89 mL / min by Cockcroft - Gault ) .
The effect of severe renal impairment ( CLcr : < 30 mL / min ) on the pharmacokinetics of tucatinib is unknown .
Hepatic Impairment Mild ( Child - Pugh A ) and moderate ( Child - Pugh B ) hepatic impairment had no clinically relevant effect on tucatinib exposure .
Tucatinib AUC0 - INF was increased by 1 . 6 fold in subjects with severe ( Child - Pugh C ) hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function .

In Vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) Enzymes : Tucatinib is a reversible inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP3A and a time - dependent inhibitor of CYP3A , but is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , or CYP2D6 .
Uridine diphosphate ( UDP ) - glucuronosyl transferase ( UGT ) Enzymes : Tucatinib is not an inhibitor of UGT1A1 .
Transporter Systems : Tucatinib is a substrate of P - gp and BCRP , but is not a substrate of OAT1 , OAT3 , OCT1 , OCT2 , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , MATE1 , MATE2 - K , or BSEP .
Tucatinib inhibits MATE1 / MATE2 - K - mediated transport of metformin and OCT2 / MATE1 - mediated transport of creatinine .
The observed serum creatinine increase in clinical studies with tucatinib is due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine via OCT2 and MATE1 .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with tucatinib .
Tucatinib was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay .

Atrophy and edema of the testes and oligospermia / germ cell debris in the epididymides were observed in male rats at ≥ 120 mg / kg / day ( approximately 13 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 HER2 - Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer The efficacy of TUKYSA in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine was evaluated in 612 patients in HER2CLIMB ( NCT02614794 ) , a randomized ( 2 : 1 ) , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial .
Patients were required to have HER2 - positive , unresectable locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer , with or without brain metastases , and prior treatment with trastuzumab , pertuzumab , and ado - trastuzumab emtansine ( T - DM1 ) separately or in combination , in the neoadjuvant , adjuvant or metastatic setting .
HER2 positivity was based on archival or fresh tissue tested with an FDA - approved test at a central laboratory prior to enrollment with HER2 positivity defined as HER2 IHC 3 + or ISH positive .
Patients with brain metastases , including those with progressing or untreated lesions , were eligible provided they were neurologically stable and did not require immediate radiation or surgery .
The trial excluded patients with leptomeningeal disease .
Randomization was stratified by the presence or history of brain metastases ( yes vs . no ) , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( 0 vs . 1 ) , and region ( U . S . , Canada , or rest of world ) .
Patients received TUKYSA 300 mg or placebo orally twice daily with a trastuzumab or a non - US approved trastuzumab product loading dose of 8 mg / kg on Day 1 of Cycle 1 if needed and then a maintenance dose of 6 mg / kg on Day 1 of every 21 - day cycle thereafter and capecitabine 1000 mg / m2 orally twice daily on Days 1 through 14 of every 21 - day cycle .
An alternate trastuzumab dosing regimen was 600 mg administered subcutaneously on Day 1 of every 21 - day cycle .
Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Tumor assessments , including brain - MRI in patients with presence or history of brain metastases at baseline , occurred every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and every 9 weeks thereafter .
The major efficacy outcome measure was progression - free survival ( PFS ) in the first 480 randomized patients assessed by blinded independent central review ( BICR ) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1 . 1 .
Additional efficacy outcome measures were evaluated in all randomized patients and included overall survival ( OS ) , PFS among patients with a history or presence of brain metastases ( PFSBrainMets ) , and confirmed objective response rate ( ORR ) .
The median age was 54 years ( range : 22 - 82 ) ; 116 ( 19 % ) patients were age 65 or older .
The majority were White ( 73 % ) and female ( 99 % ) and 51 % had an ECOG performance status of 1 .
Sixty percent had estrogen and / or progesterone receptor - positive disease .
Forty - eight percent had a presence or history of brain metastases ; of these patients , 23 % had untreated brain metastases , 40 % had treated but stable brain metastases , and 37 % had treated but radiographically progressing brain metastases .
Seventy - four percent of patients had visceral metastases .
Patients had received a median of 4 ( range , 2 to 17 ) prior lines of systemic therapy and a median of 3 ( range , 1 to 14 ) prior lines of systemic therapy in the metastatic setting .
All patients received prior trastuzumab and T - DM1 and all but two patients had prior pertuzumab .
Efficacy results are summarized in Table 12 and Figure 1 and 2 .
Efficacy results were consistent across patient subgroups defined by stratification factors ( presence or history of brain metastases , ECOG status , region of world ) and hormone receptor status .
