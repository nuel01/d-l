AZEDRA is a radioactive therapeutic agent indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with iobenguane scan positive , unresectable , locally advanced or metastatic pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma who require systemic anticancer therapy .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to administering AZEDRA .
( 2 . 1 ) • Block thyroid prior to administering AZEDRA .
( 2 . 2 ) • Do not administer if platelet count is less than 80 , 000 / mcL or absolute neutrophil count is less than 1 , 200 / mcL .
( 2 . 4 ) • Administer AZEDRA intravenously as a dosimetric dose followed by two therapeutic doses administered 90 days apart .
( 2 . 2 ) • The recommended dosimetric dose is : • Patients greater than 50 kg : 185 to 222 MBq ( 5 to 6 mCi ) • Patients 50 kg or less : 3 . 7 MBq / kg ( 0 . 1 mCi / kg ) • The recommended therapeutic dose for each of the 2 doses is : • Patients greater than 62 . 5 kg : 18 , 500 MBq ( 500 mCi ) • Patients 62 . 5 kg or less : 296 MBq / kg ( 8 mCi / kg ) • Adjust AZEDRA therapeutic doses based on radiation dose estimates results from dosimetry , if needed .
( 2 . 2 ) 2 . 1 Important Safety Information AZEDRA is a radiopharmaceutical .
Handle with appropriate safety measures to minimize radiation exposure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Use waterproof gloves and effective radiation shielding when handling AZEDRA .
Radiopharmaceuticals , including AZEDRA , should be used by or under the control of physicians who are qualified by specific training and experience in the safe use and handling of radiopharmaceuticals , and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate governmental agency authorized to license the use of radiopharmaceuticals .
Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating AZEDRA [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) , ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 2 Recommended Dosage Administer thyroid blockade and other pre - and concomitant medications as recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Dosimetric Dose The recommended AZEDRA dosimetric dose administered as an intravenous injection is : • Patients weighing greater than 50 kg : 185 to 222 MBq ( 5 or 6 mCi ) • Patients weighing 50 kg or less : 3 . 7 MBq / kg ( 0 . 1 mCi / kg ) Dosimetry and Biodistribution Assessment Following the AZEDRA dosimetric dose : • Acquire anterior / posterior whole body gamma camera images within 1 hour of the AZEDRA dosimetric dose and prior to patient voiding ( Day 0 ; Scan 1 ) .
• Acquire additional images on Day 1 or 2 following patient voiding ( Scan 2 ) .
• Acquire additional images between Days 2 - 5 following patient voiding ( Scan 3 ) .
For each individual patient , calculate the radiation dose estimates to normal organs and tissues per unit activity [ D ( organ ) ] of administered dose using data extracted from these 3 images .
Calculate in accordance with the Medical Internal Radiation Dose ( MIRD ) schema or related methodology .
Whenever possible , use patient - specific organ masses ( e . g . , estimated from imaging ) .
Therapeutic Dosage The recommended AZEDRA therapeutic dose is based on body weight and reduced , if necessary , based on the dosimetry data .
Administer a total of 2 therapeutic doses intravenously a minimum of 90 days apart .
Weight Based Dose per Therapeutic Cycle • Patients weighing greater than 62 . 5 kg : 18 , 500 MBq ( 500 mCi ) • Patients weighing 62 . 5 kg or less : 296 MBq / kg ( 8 mCi / kg ) Determine if Dose Reduction Needed Based on Critical Organ Limits • Calculate the estimated critical organ absorbed - dose by multiplying the dosimetry - derived radiation absorbed - dose per unit activity [ D ( organ ) ] by weight based therapeutic total activity ( Aw ) .
• If resulting estimated critical organ absorbed - dose is less than threshold absorbed - dose ( T ) shown in Table 1 , no dose adjustment is necessary .
• If resulting estimated critical organ absorbed - dose exceeds threshold absorbed - dose ( T ) shown in Table 1 , calculate the reduced therapeutic total activity ( i . e . , the cumulative activity that would be administered in 2 therapeutic cycles ) using the following equation : Reduced Therapeutic Total Activity = Aw × [ T ÷ { Aw × D ( organ ) } ] • Example : A 75 kg patient qualifies for a therapeutic total activity of 1000 mCi ( Aw ) .
For the kidneys , the dosimetry yields an estimated critical organ absorbed dose per unit activity of 0 . 027 Gy / mCi [ D ( kidney ) ] .
Thus , the estimated critical organ absorbed - dose to the kidney is 27 Gy [ Aw x D ( organ ) ] , which exceeds the threshold absorbed - dose for the kidneys ( T ) of 18 Gy ( Table 1 ) .
Using the equation above the reduced therapeutic total activity to be administered to this patient is 666 . 7 mCi .
1000 mCi × [ 18 Gy ÷ { 1000 mCi × 0 . 027 Gy / mCi } ] Table 1 : Absorbed - dose Threshold Values for Radiation Toxicity in Critical Organs * Threshold of ~ 0 . 5 Gy for both heart and carotid artery , derived from experience with external - beam radiotherapy and associated with fractionated exposure , has also been proposed to support an ~ 1 % mortality rate of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular deaths in > 10 - 15 years ; however , uncertainty is associated with the value ~ 0 . 5 Gy cited for vascular disease ( ICRP publication 118 , p . 300 , Table 4 . 5 ) .

( 5 . 8 ) • Risk of Infertility : May cause infertility ( 5 . 9 ) 5 . 1 Risk from Radiation Exposure AZEDRA contributes to a patient ' s overall long - term radiation exposure .
Long - term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk for cancer .
These risks of radiation associated with the use of AZEDRA are greater in pediatric patients than in adults [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Minimize radiation exposure to patients , medical personnel , and household contacts during and after treatment with AZEDRA consistent with institutional good radiation safety practices and patient management procedures [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 2 Myelosuppression Severe and prolonged myelosuppression occurred during treatment with AZEDRA [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Among the 88 patients who received a therapeutic dose of AZEDRA , 33 % experienced Grade 4 thrombocytopenia , 16 % experienced Grade 4 neutropenia , and 7 % experienced Grade 4 anemia .
Five percent of patients experienced febrile neutropenia .
In Study IB12B following the first therapeutic dose , patients who experienced Grade 4 neutropenia reached neutrophil nadir at a median of 36 days ( 27 – 55 days ) and remained at nadir for a median of 12 days ( 8 – 22 days ) until recovery to less than or equal to Grade 3 .
Following the second dose , patients who experienced Grade 4 neutropenia reached nadir at a median of 43 days ( 38 – 47 days ) and remained at nadir for a median of 18 . 5 days ( 8 – 31 days ) until recovery to less than or equal to Grade 3 .
Monitor blood cell counts weekly for up to 12 weeks or until levels return to baseline or the normal range .
Withhold and dose reduce AZEDRA as recommended based on severity of the cytopenia [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 3 Secondary Myelodysplastic Syndrome , Leukemia and Other Malignancies Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) or acute leukemias were reported in 6 . 8 % of the 88 patients who received a therapeutic dose of AZEDRA [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The time to development of MDS or acute leukemia ranged from 12 months to 7 years .
Two of the 88 patients developed a non - hematological malignancy .
One patient developed colon cancer at 18 months and one patient developed lung adenocarcinoma at 27 months following the first therapeutic dose .
5 . 4 Hypothyroidism Hypothyroidism was reported in 3 . 4 % of the 88 patients who received a therapeutic dose of AZEDRA [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The time to worsening of hypothyroidism was 4 months in one patient , and the time to development of hypothyroidism was less than one month in one patient and 18 months in one patient .
Initiate thyroid - blocking medications starting at least 1 day before and continuing for 10 days after each AZEDRA dose to reduce the risk of hypothyroidism or thyroid neoplasia [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Evaluate for clinical evidence of hypothyroidism and measure thyroid - stimulating hormone ( TSH ) levels prior to initiating AZEDRA and annually thereafter .
5 . 5 Elevations in Blood Pressure Eleven percent of the 88 patients who received a therapeutic dose of AZEDRA [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] experienced a worsening of pre - existing hypertension defined as an increase in systolic blood pressure to ≥ 160 mmHg with an increase of 20 mmHg or an increase in diastolic blood pressure to ≥ 100 mmHg with an increase of 10 mmHg .
All changes in blood pressure occurred within the first 24 hours post infusion .
Monitor blood pressure frequently during the first 24 hours after each therapeutic dose of AZEDRA .
5 . 6 Renal Toxicity Of the 88 patients who received a therapeutic dose of AZEDRA [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] , 7 % developed renal failure or acute kidney injury and 22 % demonstrated a clinically significant decrease in glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) measured at 6 or 12 months .
Monitor renal function during and after treatment with AZEDRA .
Patients with baseline renal impairment may be at greater risk of toxicity ; perform more frequent assessments of renal function in patients with mild or moderate impairment .
AZEDRA has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min ) .
5 . 7 Pneumonitis Fatal pneumonitis occurred 9 weeks after a single dose in one patient in the expanded access program for Study IB12B ( n = 11 ) .
Pneumonitis was not diagnosed among the 88 patients enrolled in Study IB12 or IB12B [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis and treat appropriately .
5 . 8 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action , AZEDRA can cause fetal harm .
There are no available data on the use of AZEDRA in pregnant women .
No animal studies using iobenguane I 131 have been conducted to evaluate its effect on female reproduction and embryo - fetal development ; however , all radiopharmaceuticals , including AZEDRA , have the potential to cause fetal harm .
Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating AZEDRA [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females and males of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with AZEDRA and for 7 months after the final dose .
Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the final dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) , ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 9 Risk of Infertility Radiation exposure associated with AZEDRA may cause infertility in males and females .
The recommended cumulative dose of 37 GBq of AZEDRA results in a radiation absorbed dose to the testes and ovaries within the range where temporary or permanent infertility can be expected following external beam radiotherapy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .

( 2 . 3 ) , ( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Drugs that Reduce Catecholamine Uptake or Deplete Stores Based on the mechanism of action of iobenguane , drugs that reduce catecholamine uptake or that deplete catecholamine stores may interfere with iobenguane uptake into cells and therefore interfere with dosimetry calculations or the efficacy of AZEDRA .
These drugs were not permitted in clinical trials that assessed the safety and efficacy of AZEDRA .
Discontinue drugs that reduce catecholamine uptake or deplete catecholamine stores , such as those listed below , for at least 5 half - lives before administration of either the dosimetry or a therapeutic dose of AZEDRA .
Do not administer these drugs until at least 7 days after each AZEDRA dose [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .

( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action , AZEDRA can cause fetal harm [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data on AZEDRA use in pregnant women .
No animal studies using iobenguane I 131 have been conducted to evaluate its effect on female reproduction and embryo - fetal development ; however , all radiopharmaceuticals , including AZEDRA , have the potential to cause fetal harm .
Advise pregnant women of the risk to a fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of iobenguane I 131 in human milk or its effects on the breastfed infant or milk production .
No lactation studies in animals were conducted .
Because of the potential risk for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with AZEDRA and for 80 days after the final dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating AZEDRA [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception AZEDRA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Females Advise women of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with AZEDRA and for 7 months following the final dose of AZEDRA .
Males Based on its mechanism of action , advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with AZEDRA and for 4 months following the final dose of AZEDRA [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
Infertility The recommended cumulative dose of 37 GBq of AZEDRA results in a radiation absorbed dose to the testes and ovaries within the range where temporary or permanent infertility can be expected following external beam radiotherapy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of AZEDRA have been established in patients 12 years and older with unresectable and iobenguane scan positive , locally advanced or metastatic , pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma ( PPGL ) which require systemic anticancer therapy .
Use of AZEDRA for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well - controlled study in adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The risks of radiation associated with AZEDRA is greater in pediatric patients than that in adult patients due to greater absorbed radiation doses and longer life expectancy .
Ensure the therapeutic benefit of AZEDRA outweighs these greater risks prior to administration in pediatric patients .
The safety and effectiveness of AZEDRA have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years old with unresectable and iobenguane scan positive , locally advanced or metastatic PPGL which require systemic anticancer therapy .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the patients enrolled in all clinical studies of AZEDRA , 17 % were 65 years or older and 1 % were 75 years or older .
Clinical studies of AZEDRA did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment The radiation dose to patients with renal impairment may be increased due to the delayed elimination of the drug [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ] .
Adjust the therapeutic dose based on radiation exposure estimates from the dosimetry assessment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ] .
The safety of AZEDRA in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) or end - stage renal disease has not been studied .
11 DESCRIPTION AZEDRA ( iobenguane I 131 ) injection , for intravenous use , is a radioactive therapeutic agent .
The drug substance iobenguane I 131 is a substituted benzylguanidine with I 131 in the meta position of the benzene ring .
Iobenguane I 131 is described as I 131 meta - iodobenzylguanidine .
The molecular weight is 279 . 1 Daltons and the structural formula is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] AZEDRA ( iobenguane I 131 ) 555 MBq / mL ( 15 mCi / mL ) injection is a sterile , clear , colorless to pale yellow solution .
Each single - dose vial contains iobenguane ( 0 . 006 mg / mL ) , sodium ascorbate ( 58 mg / mL ) and sodium gentisate ( 23 mg / mL ) in Water for Injection , USP .
The pH range of the solution is 4 . 5 to 5 . 5 , with specific activity of ~ 2 , 500 mCi / mg ( 92 , 500 MBq / mg ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 11 . 1 Physical Characteristics I 131 decays with beta and gamma emissions with a physical half - life of 8 . 021 days .
The principal beta emission has a mean energy of 191 . 6 keV , and the principal gamma emission has energy of 364 . 5 keV .
11 . 2 External Radiation The specific gamma ray constant for I 131 is 2 . 2 R / mCi hour at 1 cm .
A 2 . 55 cm thickness of Pb will attenuate the radiation emitted by a factor of about 1 , 000 .

Iobenguane is similar in structure to the neurotransmitter norepinephrine ( NE ) and is subject to the same uptake and accumulation pathways as NE .
Iobenguane is taken up by the NE transporter in adrenergic nerve terminals and accumulates in adrenergically innervated tissues , such as the heart , lungs , adrenal medulla , salivary glands , liver , and spleen as well as tumors of neural crest origin .
Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma ( PPGL ) are tumors of neural crest origin that express high levels of the NE transporter on their cell surfaces .
Following intravenous administration , AZEDRA is taken up and accumulates within pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma cells , and radiation resulting from radioactive decay of I 131 causes cell death and tumor necrosis .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The effect of AZEDRA on the QTc interval was evaluated in 74 patients with unresectable pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma .
At the recommended therapeutic dosage , no large mean increases from baseline in the QTc interval ( i . e . , > 20 ms ) were detected .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of iobenguane I 131 following a dosimetric dose were characterized in patients with malignant PPGL and other malignancies .
The mean blood area under curve ( AUC ) of iobenguane I 131 at the recommended dosimetric dose is 1 µCi * h / mL ( CV 33 % ) .
The mean maximum concentration ( Cmax ) for iobenguane I 131 is 0 . 06 µCi / mL ( CV 36 % ) , which generally occurred at the end of the AZEDRA infusion .
Distribution The volume of distribution ( mean ± SD ) of iobenguane I 131 is 2893 ± 592 mL / kg .
The blood levels of radioactivity declined with a distribution half - life ( mean ± SD ) of 0 . 37 ± 0 . 22 hours .
The non - radioactive form of iobenguane I 131 is 61 % to 63 % bound to human plasma proteins .
Elimination The mean clearance is 62 ± 24 mL / hr / kg for iobenguane I 131 and the mean terminal blood half - life is 35 ± 14 hours .
Metabolism Iobenguane I 131 does not undergo hepatic metabolism .
Excretion Iobenguane I 131 is primarily eliminated renally with cumulative excretion of 50 ± 10 % within 24 hours and 80 ± 10 % within 120 hours following AZEDRA administration .
Unchanged I 131 accounted for an average of 94 % and 93 % radioactivity excreted in urine collected at 0 - 6 and 6 - 24 hours post - dose , respectively .
Minor metabolites detected in some patients included free I 131 , quantifiable in 55 % of 11 patients in Study IB11 , as well as meta - iodohippuric acid ( MIHA ) and meta - iodobenzyl bisguanidine ( MMIBG ) quantifiable in one patient each .
Specific Populations Eight of 42 patients ( 19 % ) with mild or moderate renal impairment ( CLcr ≥ 30 - 89 mL / min by Cockcroft - Gault ) required therapeutic dose reductions based on radiation dose estimates to critical organs exceeding Emami limits ( absorbed renal dose exceeding 23 Gy ) .
The pharmacokinetics of iobenguane I 131 has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) or end - stage renal disease [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies The non - radioactive form of iobenguane does not inhibit CYP1A2 , 2B6 , 2C8 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , or 3 A .
It does not induce CYP1A , 2B6 , 2C9 , 2C19 , or 3 A .

A total of 74 patients received the dosimetric dose of AZEDRA .
Following dosimetry , 68 patients received at least one therapeutic dose and 50 patients received two therapeutic doses administered at least 90 days apart .
The dosimetric dose was 185 mBq to 222 MBq ( 5 mCi to 6 mCi ) for patients weighing > 50 kg and 3 . 7 MBq / kg ( 0 . 1 mCi / kg ) for patients weighing ≤ 50 kg .
The therapeutic dose was 18 , 500 MBq ( 500 mCi ) for patients weighing > 62 . 5 kg and 296 MBq / kg ( 8 mCi / kg ) for patients weighing ≤ 62 . 5 kg .
Among the 68 patients , the median age was 55 years ( 16 to 72 years ) , 57 % were male , 75 % were White , 21 % were Black and 4 % were Asian .
For the primary tumor diagnosis , 78 % had pheochromocytoma , 21 % had paraganglioma , and 1 % had both .
Fifty percent ( 50 % ) of patients with evaluable imaging studies had lung or liver metastases and 61 % had bone metastases at baseline .
Eighty - eight percent ( 88 % ) underwent prior surgery , 50 % received prior external radiation , 31 % received prior I 131 MIBG , 31 % received prior chemotherapy , 15 % received prior kinase inhibitors and 4 % received other prior systemic therapies .
The median ( range ) of prior therapies per patient is 2 ( 0 , 7 ) .
The efficacy results are summarized in Table 7 .
All confirmed responses per RECIST were partial responses .
