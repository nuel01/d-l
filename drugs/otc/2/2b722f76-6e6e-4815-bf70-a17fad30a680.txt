1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Potassium chloride oral solution is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of hypokalemia in patients for whom dietary management with potassium - rich foods or diuretic dose reduction are insufficient .
Potassium chloride oral solution is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of hypokalemia with or without metabolic alkalosis , in patients for whom dietary management with potassium - rich foods or diuretic dose reduction are insufficient .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dilute prior to administration .
( 2 . 1 , 5 . 1 ) Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosage accordingly .
( 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 ) Treatment of hypokalemia : • Adults : Initial doses range from 40 to 100 mEq / day in 2 to 5 divided doses : limit doses to 40 mEq per dose .
Total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq .
( 2 . 2 ) • Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old : 2 to 4 mEq / kg / day in divided doses ; not to exceed 1 mEq / kg as a single dose or 20 mEq whichever is lower ; if deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great , consider intravenous therapy .
Total daily dose should not exceed 100 mEq .
( 2 . 3 ) Maintenance or Prophylaxis of hypokalemia : • Adults : Typical dose is 20 mEq per day .
( 2 . 2 ) • Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old : typical dose is 1 mEq / kg / day .
Do not to exceed 3 mEq / kg / day .
( 2 . 3 ) 2 . 1 Administration and Monitoring Monitoring Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly .
For treatment of hypokalemia , monitor potassium levels daily or more often depending on the severity of hypokalemia until they return to normal .
Monitor potassium levels monthly - to - biannually for maintenance or prophylaxis .
The treatment of potassium depletion , particularly in the presence of cardiac disease , renal disease , or acidosis requires careful attention to acid - base balance , volume status , electrolytes , including magnesium , sodium , chloride , phosphate , and calcium , electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient .
Correct volume status , acid - base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate .
Administration Dilute the potassium chloride solution with at least 4 ounces of cold water [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Take with meals or immediately after eating .
If serum potassium concentration is less than 2 . 5 mEq / L , use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation .
2 . 2 Adult Dosing Treatment of hypokalemia Daily dose range from 40 to 100 mEq .
Give in 2 to 5 divided doses : limit doses to 40 mEq per dose .
The total daily dose should not exceed 200 mEq in a 24 hour period .
Maintenance or Prophylaxis Typical dose is 20 mEq per day .
Individualize dose based upon serum potassium levels .
Studies support the use of potassium replacement in digitalis toxicity .
When alkalosis is present , normokalemia and hyperkalemia may obscure a total potassium deficit .
The advisability of use of potassium replacement in the setting of hyperkalemia is uncertain .
2 . 3 Pediatric Dosing Treatment of hypokalemia Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old : The initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq / kg / day in divided doses ; do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq / kg or 40 mEq , whichever is lower ; maximum daily doses should not exceed 100 mEq .
If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great , consider intravenous therapy .
Maintenance or Prophylaxis Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old : Typical dose is 1 mEq / kg / day .
Do not exceed 3 mEq / kg / day .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Potassium sparing diuretics : Avoid concomitant use .
( 7 . 1 ) • Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors : Monitor for hyperkalemia .
( 7 . 2 ) Angiotensin receptor blockers : Monitor for hyperkalemia .
( 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Potassium - Sparing Diuretics Use with potassium - sparing diuretic can produce severe hyperkalemia .
Avoid concomitant use .
7 . 2 Angiotensin - Converting Enzyme Inhibitors Use with angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors produces potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production .
Potassium supplements should be given to patients receiving ACE inhibitors only with close monitoring .
7 . 3 Angiotensin Receptor Blockers Use with angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs ) produces potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production .
Potassium supplements should be given to patients receiving ARBs only with close monitoring .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with potassium chloride .
It is unlikely that potassium supplementation that does not lead to hyperkalemia would have an adverse effect on the fetus or would affect reproductive capacity .
8 . 2 Nursing Mothers The normal potassium ion content of human milk is about 13 mEq per liter .
Since oral potassium becomes part of the body potassium pool , so long as body potassium is not excessive , the contribution of potassium chloride supplementation should have little or no effect on the level in human milk .
8 . 3 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of potassium chloride have been demonstrated in children with diarrhea and malnutrition from birth to18 years .
8 . 4 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of potassium chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
10 OVERDOSAGE 10 . 1 Symptoms The administration of oral potassium salts to persons with normal excretory mechanisms for potassium rarely causes serious hyperkalemia .
However , if excretory mechanisms are impaired or if potassium is administered too rapidly potentially fatal hyperkalemia can result .
Hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic and may be manifested only by an increased serum potassium concentration ( 6 . 5 to 8 . 0 mEq / L ) and characteristic electrocardiographic changes ( peaking of T - waves , loss of P - waves , depression of S - T segment , and prolongation of the QT - interval ) .
Late manifestations include muscle paralysis and cardiovascular collapse from cardiac arrest ( 9 to12 mEq / L ) .
10 . 2 Treatment Treatment measures for hyperkalemia include the following : • Monitor closely for arrhythmias and electrolyte changes .
• Eliminate foods and medications containing potassium and of any agents with potassium - sparing properties such as potassium - sparing diuretics , ARBS , ACE inhibitors , NSAIDS , certain nutritional supplements and many others .
• Administer intravenous calcium gluconate if the patient is at no risk or low risk of developing digitalis toxicity .
• Administer intravenously 300 to 500 mL / hr of 10 % dextrose solution containing 10 to 20 units of crystalline insulin per 1000 mL .
• Correct acidosis , if present , with intravenous sodium bicarbonate .
• Use exchange resins , hemodialysis , or peritoneal dialysis .
In patients who have been stabilized on digitalis , too rapid a lowering of the serum potassium concentration can produce digitalis toxicity .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The potassium ion ( K + ) is the principal intracellular cation of most body tissues .
Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity ; the transmission of nerve impulses ; the contraction of cardiac , skeletal , and smooth muscle ; and the maintenance of normal renal function .
The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter .
The normal adult plasma concentration is 3 . 5 to 5 mEq per liter .
An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane .
Potassium is a normal dietary constituent , and under steady - state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine .
The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Based on published literature , the rate of absorption and urinary excretion of potassium from KCl oral solution were higher during the first few hours after dosing relative to modified release KCl products .
The bioavailability of potassium , as measured by the cumulative urinary excretion of K + over a 24 hour post dose period , is similar for KCl solution and modified release products .
