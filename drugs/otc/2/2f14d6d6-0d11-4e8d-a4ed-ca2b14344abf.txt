The solutions contain no bacteriostat , antimicrobial agent or added buffer and each is intended only for use as a single - dose injection .
When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded .
These solutions are parenteral fluid , nutrient and / or electrolyte replenishers .
Dextrose , USP is chemically designated D - glucose , monohydrate ( C6H12O6 • H2O ) , a hexose sugar freely soluble in water .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Potassium Chloride , USP is chemically designated KCl , a white granular powder freely soluble in water .
Sodium Chloride , USP is chemically designated NaCl , a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water .
Water for Injection , USP is chemically designated H2O .
The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated non - plasticized , film containing polypropylene and thermoplastic elastomers ( freeflex ® bag ) .
Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts ; however , biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials .
Exposure to temperatures above 25 ° C / 77 ° F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in the moisture content .
Higher temperatures lead to greater losses .
It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When administered intravenously , these solutions provide a source of water and potassium chloride with carbohydrate ( dextrose ) and sodium chloride .
See HOW SUPPLIED section for specific concentrations of these various solutions .
Solutions containing carbohydrate in the form of dextrose restore blood glucose levels and provide calories .
Carbohydrate in the form of dextrose may aid in minimizing liver glycogen depletion and exerts a protein - sparing action .
Dextrose injected parenterally undergoes oxidation to carbon dioxide and water .
Intravenous solutions containing potassium chloride are particularly intended to provide needed potassium cation ( K + ) .
Potassium is the chief cation of body cells ( 160 mEq / liter of intracellular water ) .
It is found in low concentration in plasma and extracellular fluids ( 3 . 5 to 5 . 0 mEq / liter in a healthy adult ) .
Potassium plays an important role in electrolyte balance .
Normally about 80 to 90 % of the potassium intake is excreted in the urine ; the remainder in the stools and to a small extent , in the perspiration .
The kidney does not conserve potassium well so that during fasting or in patients on a potassium - free diet , potassium loss from the body continues resulting in potassium depletion .
A deficiency of either potassium or chloride will lead to a deficit of the other .
Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium ( Na + ) and chloride ( Cl − ) ions .
Sodium ( Na + ) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances .
Chloride ( Cl − ) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells .
The distribution and excretion of sodium ( Na + ) and chloride ( Cl − ) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output .
Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70 % of total body weight .
Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters ( 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production ) .
Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms .
Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium ( Na + ) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE These solutions are indicated in patients requiring parenteral administration of potassium chloride with minimal carbohydrate calories and sodium chloride .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Solutions containing potassium chloride are contraindicated in diseases where high potassium levels may be encountered .
WARNINGS Solutions which contain potassium ions should be used with great care , if at all , in patients with hyperkalemia , severe renal failure and in conditions in which potassium retention is present .
To avoid potassium intoxication , do not infuse these solutions rapidly .
In patients with severe renal insufficiency or adrenal insufficiency , administration of potassium chloride may cause potassium intoxication .
Solutions containing sodium ions should be used with great care , if at all , in patients with congestive heart failure , severe renal insufficiency and in clinical states in which there exists edema with sodium retention .
In patients with diminished renal function , administration of solutions containing sodium or potassium ions may result in sodium or potassium retention .
The intravenous administration of these solutions can cause fluid and / or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration of administered parenteral solutions .
The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of such solutions .
PRECAUTIONS Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance , electrolyte concentrations and acid - base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation .
Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus .
Caution must be exercised in the administration of parenteral fluids , especially those containing sodium ions , to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin .
Potassium replacement therapy should be guided primarily by serial electrocardiograms .
Plasma potassium levels are not necessarily indicative of tissue potassium levels .
High plasma concentrations of potassium may cause death through cardiac depression , arrhythmias or arrest .
Potassium - containing solutions should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease , particularly in digitalized patients or in the presence of renal disease .
Care should be exercised to insure that the needle ( or catheter ) is well within the lumen of the vein and that extravasation does not occur .
Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged .
Discard unused portion .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Studies with solutions from flexible plastic containers have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , mutagenic potential or effects on fertility .
Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with dextrose , potassium chloride or sodium chloride .
It is also not known whether dextrose , potassium chloride or sodium chloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Dextrose , potassium chloride or sodium chloride should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers : Caution should be exercised when solutions from flexible plastic containers are administered to a nursing mother .
Pediatric Use : The safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population are based on the similarity of the clinical conditions of the pediatric and adult populations .
In neonates or very small infants the volume of fluid may affect fluid and electrolyte balance .
Frequent monitoring of serum glucose concentrations is required when dextrose is prescribed to pediatric patients , particularly neonates and low birth weight infants .
In very low birth weight infants , excessive or rapid administration of dextrose injection may result in increased serum osmolality and possible intracerebral hemorrhage .
Geriatric Use : An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
Sodium and potassium ions are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Reactions which may occur because of the solutions or technique of administration include febrile response , infection at the site of injection , venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection , extravasation and hypervolemia .
If an adverse reaction does occur , discontinue the infusion , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
Nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain and diarrhea have been reported with potassium therapy .
The signs and symptoms of potassium intoxication include paresthesias of the extremities , flaccid paralysis , listlessness , mental confusion , weakness and heaviness of the legs , hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias , heart block , electrocardiographic abnormalities such as disappearance of P waves , spreading and slurring of the QRS complex with development of a biphasic curve and cardiac arrest .
Potassium - containing solutions are intrinsically irritating to tissues .
Therefore , extreme care should be taken to avoid perivascular infiltration .
Local tissue necrosis and subsequent sloughing may result if extravasation occurs .
Chemical phlebitis and venospasm have also been reported .
Should perivascular infiltration occur , I . V . administration at that site should be discontinued at once .
Local infiltration of the affected area with procaine hydrochloride , 1 % , to which hyaluronidase may be added , will often reduce venospasm and dilute the potassium remaining in the tissues locally .
Local application of heat may also be helpful .

OVERDOSAGE In the event of potassium overdosage , discontinue the infusion immediately and institute intensive corrective therapy to reduce serum potassium levels .
See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION These solutions should be administered only by intravenous infusion and as directed by the physician .
The dose and rate of injection are dependent upon the age , weight and clinical condition of the patient .
If the serum potassium level is greater than 2 . 5 mEq / liter , potassium should be given at a rate not to exceed 10 mEq / hour in a concentration less than 30 mEq / liter .
Somewhat faster rates and greater concentrations ( usually up to 40 mEq / liter ) of potassium may be indicated in patients with more severe potassium deficiency .
The total 24 - hour dose should not generally exceed 200 mEq of potassium .
As reported in the literature , the dosage and constant infusion rate of intravenous dextrose must be selected with caution in pediatric patients , particularly neonates and low birth weight infants , because of the increased risk of hyperglycemia / hypoglycemia .
Drug Interactions Additives may be incompatible .
Consult with pharmacist , if available .
When introducing additives , use aseptic technique , mix thoroughly and do not store .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
