8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ketoconazole foam , 2 % use in pregnant women to identify a drug ‑ associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
No reproductive studies in animals have been performed with ketoconazole foam , 2 % .
In animal reproduction studies with pregnant mice , rats and rabbits both embryotoxic and developmental effects ( structural abnormalities ) were observed following oral dosing of ketoconazole during organogenesis .
Assuming equivalent systemic absorption of topical and oral ketoconazole doses and an ketoconazole foam , 2 % maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 8 grams ( equivalent to 160 mg ketoconazole ) , embryotoxic effects were observed at 0 . 8 to 2 . 4 times the MRHD and developmental effects were observed at 4 . 8 times the MRHD [ see Data ] .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data The animal multiples of human exposure calculations are based on body surface area ( BSA ) comparisons of oral doses administered to animals and an ketoconazole foam , 2 % maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 8 grams ( equivalent to 2 . 67 mg ketoconazole / kg / day for a 60 kg individual or 98 . 8 mg ketoconazole / m2 / day ) .
Embryofetal development studies have been conducted in mice , rats and rabbits with orally administered ketoconazole .
When orally administered to mice on gestational days 6 through 18 ( covering the period of organogenesis ) , ketoconazole was embryotoxic ( 25 mg / kg and higher ; 0 . 8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) with a high incidence of resorptions , increased number of stillbirths and delayed parturition .
Delays in maturation were also observed .
There was no evidence of maternal toxicity or malformations at up to 50 mg / kg ( 1 . 5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) .
No treatment related developmental effects were observed at 10 mg / kg ( 0 . 3 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) .
In the presence of maternal toxicity in rats , orally administered ketoconazole was both embryotoxic ( 40 mg / kg and higher ; 2 . 4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) , including increased resorbed fetuses and stillbirths , and teratogenic ( 80 mg / kg and higher ; 4 . 8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) , including syndactylia , oligodactylia , waved ribs and cleft palate .
Additionally , 100 mg / kg ( 6 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) ketoconazole orally administered on a single day during gestation ( gestational days 9 through 12 ) was embryotoxic ( increased resorptions ) .
This same oral dose given on gestation day 12 , 13 , 14 or 15 induced external malformations including cleft palate , micromelia and digital anomalies ( brachydactyly , ectrodactyly , syndactyly ) .
In pregnant rabbits orally administered ketoconazole , evidence of embryotoxicity ( increased resorptions ) was observed at 10 mg / kg ( 1 . 2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) and higher and an increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities was observed at 40 mg / kg ( 4 . 8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of ketoconazole in human milk , or the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production after topical application of ketoconazole foam , 2 % to women who are breastfeeding .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ketoconazole in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis is not known .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of ketoconazole foam , 2 % has not been established .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In a bioavailability study , 12 subjects with moderate to severe seborrheic dermatitis applied 3 g of ketoconazole foam , 2 % twice daily for 4 weeks .
Circulating plasma levels of ketoconazole were < 6 ng / mL for a majority of subjects ( 75 % ) , with a maximum level of 11 ng / mL observed in one subject .
12 . 4 Microbiology Ketoconazole is an antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro synthesis of ergosterol , a key sterol in the cell membrane of Malassezia furfur .
The clinical significance of antifungal activity in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis is not known .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic or photo - carcinogenic potential of ketoconazole foam , 2 % .
In oral carcinogenicity studies in mice ( 18 - months ) and rats ( 24 - months ) at dose levels of 5 , 20 and 80 mg / kg / day ketoconazole was not carcinogenic .
The high dose in these studies was approximately 2 . 4 to 4 . 8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons .
In a bacterial reverse mutation assay , ketoconazole did not express any mutagenic potential .
In three in vivo assays ( sister chromatid exchange in humans , dominant lethal and micronucleus tests in mice ) , ketoconazole did not exhibit any genotoxic potential .
In animal fertility studies , oral ketoconazole impaired both male and female fertility in rats in a dose and duration dependent manner .
In females , oral doses up to 40 mg / kg ( 2 . 4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) had no effect on fertility , while doses of 75 mg / kg ( 4 . 5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) and higher decreased the pregnancy rate and number of implantation sites .
In male rats , oral dosing at 200 mg / kg / day ( 12 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) for three days decreased fertility and 400 mg / kg / day ( 24 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) for three days resulted in a complete loss of fertility .
When administered for longer durations ( up to 3 months ) , decreased fertility in male rats was observed at doses as low as 24 mg / kg / day ( 1 . 4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) .
In male beagle dogs , an oral dose of 25 mg / kg / day ketoconazole for up to 4 weeks ( 5 . 2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons ) resulted in decreased sperm motility , decreased sperm count , increased abnormal sperm and atrophy of the testes .
These effects were reversed subsequent to withdrawal of treatment .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of ketoconazole foam , 2 % were evaluated in a randomized , double - blind , vehicle - controlled trial in subjects 12 years and older with mild to severe seborrheic dermatitis .
In the trial , 427 subjects received ketoconazole foam , 2 % and 420 subjects received vehicle foam .
Subjects applied ketoconazole foam , 2 % or vehicle foam twice daily for 4 weeks to affected areas on the face , scalp , and / or chest .
The overall disease severity in terms of erythema , scaling , and induration was assessed at Baseline and week 4 on a 5 - point Investigator ’ s Static Global Assessment ( ISGA ) scale .
Treatment success was defined as achieving a Week 4 ( end of treatment ) ISGA score of 0 ( clear ) or 1 ( majority of lesions have individual scores for scaling , erythema , and induration that averages 1 [ minimal or faint ] ) and at least two grades of improvement from baseline .
The results are presented in Table 2 .
The database was not large enough to assess whether there were differences in effects in age , gender , or race subgroups .
