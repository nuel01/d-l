CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Lactated Ringer ' s Injection USP provides electrolytes and is a source of water for hydration .
It is capable of inducing diuresis depending on the clinical condition of the patient .
This solution also contains lactate which produces a metabolic alkalinizing effect .
Sodium , the major cation of the extracellular fluid , functions primarily in the control of water distribution , fluid balance , and osmotic pressure of body fluids .
Sodium is also associated with chloride and bicarbonate in the regulation of the acid - base equilibrium of body fluid .
Potassium , the principal cation of intracellular fluid , participates in carbohydrate utilization and protein synthesis , and is critical in the regulation of nerve conduction and muscle contraction , particularly in the heart .
Chloride , the major extracellular anion , closely follows the metabolism of sodium , and changes in the acid - base balance of the body are reflected by changes in the chloride concentration .
Calcium , an important cation , provides the framework of bones and teeth in the form of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate .
In the ionized form , calcium is essential for the functional mechanism of the clotting of blood , normal cardiac function , and regulation of neuromuscular irritability .
Sodium lactate is a racemic salt containing both the levo form , which is oxidized by the liver to bicarbonate , and the dextro form , which is converted to glycogen .
Lactate is slowly metabolized to carbon dioxide and water , accepting one hydrogen ion and resulting in the formation of bicarbonate for the lactate consumed .
These reactions depend on oxidative cellular activity .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE This solution is indicated for use in adults and pediatric patients as a source of electrolytes and water for hydration .
CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of Lactated Ringer ’ s Injection USP is contraindicated in neonates ( 28 days of age or younger ) receiving concomitant treatment with ceftriaxone , even if separate infusion lines are used , due to the risk of fatal ceftriaxone - calcium salt precipitation in the neonate ’ s bloodstream [ see Warnings , Drug Interactions , Pediatric Use ] .
This solution is contraindicated where the administration of sodium , potassium , calcium , lactate , or chloride could be clinically detrimental .
Lactate administration is contraindicated in severe metabolic acidosis or alkalosis , and in severe liver disease or anoxic states which affect lactate metabolism .
WARNINGS Precipitation with Ceftriaxone Precipitation of ceftriaxone - calcium can occur when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium - containing solutions , such as Lactated Ringer ’ s Injection USP , in the same intravenous administration line .
Do not administer ceftriaxone simultaneously with Lactated Ringer ’ s Injection USP via a Y - site .
Deaths have occurred in neonates ( 28 days of age or younger ) who received concomitant intravenous calcium - containing solutions with ceftriaxone resulting from calcium - ceftriaxone precipitates in the lungs and kidneys , even when separate infusion lines were used .
Lactated Ringer ’ s Injection USP is contraindicated in neonates receiving ceftriaxone .
However , in patients other than neonates , ceftriaxone and Lactated Ringer ’ s Injection USP may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid .
[ see Contraindications , Warnings , Drug Interactions , Pediatric Use ] .
Solutions containing lactate are not for use in the treatment of lactic acidosis .
Solutions containing lactate should be used with great care in patients with metabolic or respiratory alkalosis , and in those conditions in which there is an increased level or an impaired utilization of lactate , such as severe hepatic insufficiency .
The administration of intravenous solutions can cause fluid and / or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration .
The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentration .
Solutions containing sodium ions should be used with great care , if at all , in patients with congestive heart failure , severe renal insufficiency , and in clinical states in which there is sodium retention with edema .
Solutions containing potassium ions should be used with great care , if at all , in patients with hyperkalemia , severe renal failure , and in conditions in which potassium ions retention is present .
In patients with diminished renal function , administration of solutions containing sodium or potassium ions may result in sodium or potassium retention .
Solutions containing calcium ions should not be administered through the same administration set as blood because of the likelihood of coagulation .
PRECAUTIONS General This solution should be used with care in patients with hypervolemia , renal insufficiency , urinary tract obstruction , or impending or frank cardiac decompensation .
Extraordinary electrolytes losses such as may occur during protracted nasogastric suction , vomiting , diarrhea or gastrointestinal fistula drainage may necessitate additional electrolyte supplementation .
Additional essential electrolytes , minerals and vitamins should be supplied as needed .
Sodium - containing solutions should be administered with caution to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin , or to other salt - retaining patients .
Care should be exercised in administering solutions containing sodium or potassium to patients with renal or cardiovascular insufficiency , with or without congestive heart failure , particularly if they are postoperative or elderly .
Potassium therapy should be guided primarily by serial electrocardiograms , especially in patients receiving digitalis .
Serum potassium levels are not necessarily indicative of tissue potassium levels .
Solutions containing calcium should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease , particularly when accompanied by renal disease .
Parenteral calcium should be administered with extreme caution to patients receiving digitalis preparations .
Solutions containing lactate should be used with caution .
Excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis .
The conversion of lactate to bicarbonate is markedly delayed in the presence of tissue anoxia and reduced capacity of the liver to metabolize lactate .
This may occur under conditions such as metabolic acidosis associated with circulatory insufficiency , extracorporeal circulation , hypothermia , glycogen storage disease , liver dysfunction , respiratory alkalosis , shock or cardiac decompensation .
To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing this solution with other additives that may be prescribed , the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing , prior to administration , and periodically during administration .
Do not use plastic container in series connection .
If administration is controlled by a pumping device , care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result .
If administration is not controlled by a pumping device , refrain from applying excessive pressure ( > 300 mmHg ) causing distortion to the container such as wringing or twisting .
Such handling could result in breakage of the container .
This solution is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment .
It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours .
Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact .
Laboratory Tests Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance , electrolyte concentrations , and acid - base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation .
Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require tailoring of the electrolyte pattern , in this or an alternative solution .
Drug Interactions Ceftriaxone Precipitation of ceftriaxone - calcium can occur when ceftriaxone is mixed with calcium - containing solutions , such as Lactated Ringer ’ s Injection USP , in the same intravenous administration line .
Do not administer ceftriaxone simultaneously with Lactated Ringer ’ s Injection USP via a Y - site .
However , in patients other than neonates , ceftriaxone and Lactated Ringer ’ s Injection USP may be administered sequentially if the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid [ see Warnings , Dosage and Administration ] .
Deaths have occurred in neonates ( 28 days of age or younger ) who received concomitant intravenous calcium - containing solutions with ceftriaxone resulting from calcium - ceftriaxone precipitates in the lungs and kidneys , even when separate infusion lines were used [ see Contraindications , Warnings , Pediatric Use , Dosage and Administration ] .
Some additives may be incompatible .
Consult with pharmacist .
When introducing additives , use aseptic techniques .
Mix thoroughly .
Do not store .

Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Lactated Ringer ' s Injection USP .
It is also not known whether Lactated Ringer ' s Injection USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Lactated Ringer ' s Injection USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Labor and Delivery As reported in the literature , Lactated Ringer ' s Injection USP has been administered during labor and delivery .
Caution should be exercised , and the fluid balance , glucose and electrolyte concentrations , and acid - base balance , of both mother and fetus should be evaluated periodically or whenever warranted by the condition of the patient or fetus .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when Lactated Ringer ' s Injection USP is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use Deaths have occurred in neonates ( 28 days of age or younger ) who received concomitant intravenous calcium - containing solutions with ceftriaxone resulting from calcium - ceftriaxone precipitates in the lungs and kidneys , even when separate infusion lines were used .
Lactated Ringer ’ s Injection USP is contraindicated in neonates receiving ceftriaxone [ see Contraindications , Warnings , Drug Interactions ] .
Safety and effectiveness of Lactated Ringer ' s Injection USP in pediatric patients have not been established by adequate and well controlled trials , however , the use of electrolyte solutions in the pediatric population is referenced in the medical literature .
The warnings , precautions , and adverse reactions identified in the label copy should be observed in the pediatric population .
Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Lactated Ringer ' s Injection USP did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Allergic reactions or anaphylactoid symptoms such as localized or generalized urticaria and pruritus ; periorbital , facial , and / or laryngeal edema ; coughing , sneezing , and / or difficulty with breathing have been reported during administration of Lactated Ringer ' s Injection USP .
The reporting frequency of these signs and symptoms is higher in women during pregnancy .
Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response , infection at the site of injection , venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection , extravasation and hypervolemia .
Symptoms may result from an excess or deficit of one or more of the ions present in the solution ; therefore , frequent monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential .
Hypernatremia may be associated with edema and exacerbation of congestive heart failure due to the retention of water , resulting in an expanded extracellular fluid volume .
Reactions reported with the use of potassium - containing solutions include nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain and diarrhea .
The signs and symptoms of potassium intoxication include paresthesias of the extremities , areflexia , muscular or respiratory paralysis , mental confusion , weakness , hypotension , cardiac arrhythmias , heart block , electrocardiographic abnormalities and cardiac arrest .
Potassium deficits result in disruption of neuromuscular function , and intestinal ileus and dilatation .
If infused in large amounts , chloride ions may cause a loss of bicarbonate ions , resulting in an acidifying effect .
Abnormally high plasma levels of calcium can result in depression , amnesia , headaches , drowsiness , disorientation , syncope , hallucinations , hypotonia of both skeletal and smooth muscles , dysphagia , arrhythmias and coma .
Calcium deficits can result in neuromuscular hyperexcitability , including cramps and convulsions .
Although the metabolism of lactate to bicarbonate is a relatively slow process , aggressive administration of sodium lactate may result in metabolic alkalosis .
Careful monitoring of blood acid - base balance is essential during the administration of sodium lactate .
The physician should also be alert to the possibility of adverse reactions to drug additives .
Prescribing information for drug additives to be administered in this manner should be consulted .
If an adverse reaction does occur , discontinue the infusion , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of a fluid or solute overload during parenteral therapy , reevaluate the patient ' s condition and institute appropriate corrective treatment .
In the event of overdosage with potassium - containing solutions , discontinue the infusion immediately and institute corrective therapy to reduce serum potassium levels .
Treatment of hyperkalemia includes the following : • Dextrose Injection USP , 10 % or 25 % , containing 10 units of crystalline insulin per 20 grams of dextrose administered intravenously , 300 to 500 mL per hour .
• Absorption and exchange of potassium using sodium or ammonium cycle cation exchange resin , orally and as retention enema .
• Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis .
The use of potassium - containing foods or medications must be eliminated .
However , in cases of digitalization , too rapid a lowering of plasma potassium concentration can cause digitalis toxicity .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION This solution is for intravenous use only .
Dosage is to be directed by a physician and is dependent upon age , weight , clinical condition of the patient and laboratory determinations .
Frequent laboratory determinations and clinical evaluation are essential to monitor changes in blood glucose and electrolyte concentrations , and fluid and electrolyte balance during prolonged parenteral therapy .
Fluid administration should be based on calculated maintenance or replacement fluid requirements for each patient .
The presence of calcium ions in this solution should be considered when phosphate is present in additive solutions , in order to avoid precipitation .
Some additives may be incompatible .
