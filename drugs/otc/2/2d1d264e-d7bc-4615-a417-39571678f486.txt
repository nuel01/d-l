When reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection to a concentration of 50 mg / mL for the 5 g Pharmacy Bulk Package bottle and 100 mg / mL for the 10 g Pharmacy Bulk Package bottle , the pH of the solution is between 2 . 5 and 4 . 5 .
Vancomycin hydrochloride for injection , USP should be administered intravenously in diluted solution ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Vancomycin is a tricyclic glycopeptide antibiotic derived from Amycolatopsis orientalis ( formerly Nocardia orientalis ) .
Vancomycin hydrochloride USP is a white or almost white , hygroscopic powder .
The chemical name for vancomycin hydrochloride is 3 S - [ 3 R * , 6 S * ( S * ) , 7 S * , 22 S * , 23 R * , 26 R * , 36 S * , 38 aS * ] ] - 3 - ( 2 - Amino - 2 - oxoethyl ) - 44 - [ [ 2 - O - ( 3 - amino - 2 , 3 , 6 - trideoxy - 3 - C - methyl - α - L - lyxo - hexopyranosyl ) - ß - D - glucopyranosyl ] oxy ] - 10 , 19 - dichloro - 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 38 a - tetradecahydro - 7 , 22 , 28 , 30 , 32 - pentahydroxy - 6 - [ [ 4 - methyl - 2 - ( methylamino ) - 1 - oxopentyl ] amino ] - 2 , 5 , 24 , 38 , 39 - pentaoxo - 22 H - 8 , 11 : 18 , 21 - dietheno - 23 , 36 - ( iminomethano ) - 13 , 16 : 31 , 35 - dimetheno - 1 H , 16 H - [ 1 , 6 , 9 ] oxadiazacyclohexadecino [ 4 , 5 - m ] [ 10 , 2 , 16 ] - benzoxadiazacyclotetracosine - 26 - carboxylic acid , monohydrochloride .
The molecular formula is C66H75Cl2N9O24 • HCl and the molecular weight is 1 , 485 . 74 .
Vancomycin hydrochloride has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] A pharmacy bulk package is a sterile dosage form containing many single doses .
The contents are intended for use in a pharmacy admixture program and are restricted to the preparation of admixtures for IV infusion .
AFTER RECONSTITUTION FURTHER DILUTION IS REQUIRED BEFORE USE .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Vancomycin is poorly absorbed after oral administration .
In subjects with normal kidney function , multiple intravenous dosing of 1 g of vancomycin ( 15 mg / kg ) infused over 60 minutes produces mean plasma concentrations of approximately 63 mcg / mL immediately after the completion of infusion , mean plasma concentrations of approximately 23 mcg / mL 2 hours after infusion , and mean plasma concentrations of approximately 8 mcg / mL 11 hours after the end of the infusion .
Multiple dosing of 500 mg infused over 30 minutes produces mean plasma concentrations of about 49 mcg / mL at the completion of infusion , mean plasma concentrations of about 19 mcg / mL 2 hours after infusion , and mean plasma concentrations of about 10 mcg / mL 6 hours after infusion .
The plasma concentrations during multiple dosing are similar to those after a single dose .
The mean elimination half - life of vancomycin from plasma is 4 to 6 hours in subjects with normal renal function .
In the first 24 hours , about 75 % of an administered dose of vancomycin is excreted in urine by glomerular filtration .
Mean plasma clearance is about 0 . 058 L / kg / h , and mean renal clearance is about 0 . 048 L / kg / h .
Renal dysfunction slows excretion of vancomycin .
In anephric patients , the average half - life of elimination is 7 . 5 days .
The distribution coefficient is from 0 . 3 to 0 . 43 L / kg .
There is no apparent metabolism of the drug .
About 60 % of an intraperitoneal dose of vancomycin administered during peritoneal dialysis is absorbed systemically in 6 hours .
Serum concentrations of about 10 mcg / mL are achieved by intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg / kg of vancomycin .
However , the safety and efficacy of the intraperitoneal use of vancomycin has not been established in adequate and well - controlled trials ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
Total systemic and renal clearance of vancomycin may be reduced in the elderly .
Vancomycin is approximately 55 % serum protein bound as measured by ultrafiltration at vancomycin serum concentrations of 10 to 100 mcg / mL .
After IV administration of vancomycin , inhibitory concentrations are present in pleural , pericardial , ascitic , and synovial fluids ; in urine ; in peritoneal dialysis fluid ; and in atrial appendage tissue .
Vancomycin does not readily diffuse across normal meninges into the spinal fluid ; but , when the meninges are inflamed , penetration into the spinal fluid occurs .
MICROBIOLOGY The bactericidal action of vancomycin results primarily from inhibition of cell - wall biosynthesis .
In addition , vancomycin alters bacterial - cell - membrane permeability and RNA synthesis .
There is no cross - resistance between vancomycin and other antibiotics .
Vancomycin is not active in vitro against gram - negative bacilli , mycobacteria , or fungi .
Synergy The combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside acts synergistically in vitro against many strains of Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus bovis , enterococci , and the viridans group streptococci .
Vancomycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section .
Aerobic gram - positive microorganisms Diphtheroids Enterococci ( e . g . , Enterococcus faecalis ) Staphylococci , including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis ( including heterogeneous methicillin - resistant strains ) Streptococcus bovis Viridans group streptococci The following in vitro data are available , but their clinical significance is unknown .
Vancomycin exhibits in vitro MIC ' s of 1 mcg / mL or less against most ( ≥ 90 % ) strains of streptococci listed below and MIC ' s of 4 mcg / mL or less against most ( ≥ 90 % ) strains of other listed microorganisms ; however , the safety and effectiveness of vancomycin in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well - controlled clinical trials .
Aerobic gram - positive microorganisms Listeria monocytogenes Streptococcus pyogenes Streptococcus pneumoniae ( including penicillin - resistant strains ) Streptococcus agalactiae Anaerobic gram - positive microorganisms Actinomyces species Lactobacillus species Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug , please see : https : / / www . fda . gov / STIC .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Vancomycin hydrochloride for injection , USP is indicated for the treatment of serious or severe infections caused by susceptible strains of methicillin - resistant ( β - lactam - resistant ) staphylococci .
It is indicated for penicillin - allergic patients , for patients who cannot receive or who have failed to respond to other drugs , including the penicillins or cephalosporins , and for infections caused by vancomycin - susceptible organisms that are resistant to other antimicrobial drugs .
Vancomycin hydrochloride for injection , USP is indicated for initial therapy when methicillin - resistant staphylococci are suspected , but after susceptibility data are available , therapy should be adjusted accordingly .
Vancomycin hydrochloride for injection , USP is effective in the treatment of staphylococcal endocarditis .
Its effectiveness has been documented in other infections due to staphylococci , including septicemia , bone infections , lower respiratory tract infections , skin and skin structure infections .
When staphylococcal infections are localized and purulent , antibiotics are used as adjuncts to appropriate surgical measures .
Vancomycin hydrochloride for injection , USP has been reported to be effective alone or in combination with an aminoglycoside for endocarditis caused by S . viridans or S . bovis .
For endocarditis caused by enterococci ( e . g . , E . faecalis ) , vancomycin has been reported to be effective only in combination with an aminoglycoside .
Vancomycin hydrochloride for injection , USP has been reported to be effective for the treatment of diphtheroid endocarditis .
Vancomycin hydrochloride for injection , USP has been used successfully in combination with either rifampin , an aminoglycoside , or both in early - onset prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by S . epidermidis or diphtheroids .
Specimens for bacteriologic cultures should be obtained in order to isolate and identify causative organisms and to determine their susceptibilities to vancomycin .
To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of vancomycin hydrochloride for injection , USP and other antibacterial drugs , vancomycin hydrochloride for injection , USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria .
When culture and susceptibility information are available , they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy .
In the absence of such data , local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy .
The parenteral form of vancomycin hydrochloride may be administered orally for treatment of antibiotic - associated pseudomembranous colitis produced by C . difficile and for staphylococcal enterocolitis .
Parenteral administration of vancomycin hydrochloride alone is of unproven benefit for these indications .
Vancomycin is not effective by the oral route for other types of Infection .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Vancomycin hydrochloride for injection is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to this antibiotic .
WARNINGS Rapid bolus administration ( e . g . , over several minutes ) may be associated with exaggerated hypotension , including shock and rarely cardiac arrest .
Vancomycin hydrochloride for injection should be administered in a diluted solution over a period of not less than 60 minutes to avoid rapid - infusion - related reactions .
Stopping the infusion usually results in prompt cessation of these reactions .
Ototoxicity has occurred in patients receiving vancomycin hydrochloride for injection .
It may be transient or permanent .
It has been reported mostly in patients who have been given excessive doses , who have an underlying hearing loss , or who are receiving concomitant therapy with another ototoxic agent , such as an aminoglycoside .
Vancomycin should be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency because the risk of toxicity is appreciably increased by high , prolonged blood concentrations .
Dosage of vancomycin hydrochloride for injection must be adjusted for patients with renal dysfunction ( see PRECAUTIONSand DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including vancomycin hydrochloride for injection , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibiotic treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
PRECAUTIONS General Clinically significant serum concentrations have been reported in some patients being treated for active C . difficile - induced pseudomembranous colitis after multiple oral doses of vancomycin .
Prolonged use of vancomycin hydrochloride for injection may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible microorganisms .
Careful observation of the patient is essential .
If superinfection occurs during therapy , appropriate measures should be taken .
In rare instances , there have been reports of pseudomembranous colitis due to C . difficile developing in patients who received intravenous vancomycin hydrochloride for injection .
In order to minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity when treating patients with underlying renal dysfunction or patients receiving concomitant therapy with an aminoglycoside , serial monitoring of renal function should be performed and particular care should be taken in following appropriate dosing schedules ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Serial tests of auditory function may be helpful in order to minimize the risk of ototoxicity .
Reversible neutropenia has been reported in patients receiving vancomycin hydrochloride for injection ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
Patients who will undergo prolonged therapy with vancomycin hydrochloride for injection or those who are receiving concomitant drugs which may cause neutropenia should have periodic monitoring of the leukocyte count .
Vancomycin hydrochloride for injection is irritating to tissue and must be given by a secure IV route of administration .
Pain , tenderness , and necrosis occur with intramuscular ( IM ) injection of vancomycin hydrochloride for injection or with inadvertent extravasation .
Thrombophlebitis may occur , the frequency and severity of which can be minimized by administering the drug slowly as a dilute solution ( 2 . 5 to 5 g / L ) and by rotation of venous access sites .
There have been reports that the frequency of infusion - related events ( including hypotension , flushing , erythema , urticaria , and pruritus ) increases with the concomitant administration of anesthetic agents .
Infusion - related events may be minimized by the administration of vancomycin as a 60 - minute infusion prior to anesthetic induction .
The safety and efficacy of vancomycin administered by the intrathecal ( intralumbar or intraventricular ) route or by the intraperitoneal route have not been established by adequate and well controlled trials .
Reports have revealed that administration of sterile vancomycin by the intraperitoneal route during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) has resulted in a syndrome of chemical peritonitis .
To date , this syndrome has ranged from cloudy dialysate alone to a cloudy dialysate accompanied by variable degrees of abdominal pain and fever .
This syndrome appears to be short - lived after discontinuation of intraperitoneal vancomycin .
Prescribing vancomycin hydrochloride for injection , USP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria .
DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of vancomycin and anesthetic agents has been associated with erythema and histamine - like flushing ( see Pediatric Use under PRECAUTIONS ) and anaphylactoid reactions ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
Concurrent and / or sequential systemic or topical use of other potentially , neurotoxic and / or nephrotoxic drugs , such as amphotericin B , aminoglycosides , bacitracin , polymyxin B , colistin , viomycin , or cisplatin , when indicated , requires careful monitoring .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Although no long - term studies in animals have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , no mutagenic potential of vancomycin hydrochloride for injection was found in standard laboratory tests .
No definitive fertility studies have been performed .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with vancomycin .
It is not known whether vancomycin can affect reproduction capacity .
In a controlled clinical study , the potential ototoxic and nephrotoxic effects of vancomycin on infants were evaluated when the drug was administered to pregnant women for serious staphylococcal infections complicating intravenous drug abuse .
Vancomycin was found in cord blood .
No sensorineural hearing loss or nephrotoxicity attributable to vancomycin was noted .
One infant whose mother received vancomycin in the third trimester experienced conductive hearing loss that was not attributed to the administration of vancomycin .
Because the number of patients treated in this study was limited and vancomycin was administered only in the second and third trimesters , it is not known whether vancomycin causes fetal harm .
Vancomycin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers Vancomycin hydrochloride for injection is excreted in human milk .
Caution should be exercised when vancomycin hydrochloride for injection is administered to a nursing woman .
Because of the potential for adverse events , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
Pediatric Use In pediatric patients , it may be appropriate to confirm desired vancomycin serum concentrations .
Concomitant administration of vancomycin and anesthetic agents has been associated with erythema and histamine - like flushing in pediatric patients ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
Geriatric Use The natural decrement of glomerular filtration with increasing age may lead to elevated vancomycin serum concentrations if dosage is not adjusted .
Vancomycin dosage schedules should be adjusted in elderly patients ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including vancomycin hydrochloride for injection , USP should only be used to treat bacterial infections .
They do not treat viral infections ( e . g . , the common cold ) .
When vancomycin hydrochloride for injection , USP is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection , patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy , the medication should be taken exactly as directed .
Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may ( 1 ) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and ( 2 ) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by vancomycin hydrochloride for injection , USP or other antibacterial drugs in the future .
Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued .
Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics , patients can develop watery and bloody stools ( with or without stomach cramps and fever ) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic .
If this occurs , patients should contact their physician as soon as possible .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Infusion - Related Events During or soon after rapid infusion of vancomycin hydrochloride for injection , patients may develop anaphylactoid reactions , including hypotension ( see ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY ) , wheezing , dyspnea , urticaria , or pruritus .
Rapid infusion may also cause flushing of the upper body ( “ red neck ” ) or pain and muscle spasm of the chest and back .
These reactions usually resolve within 20 minutes but may persist for several hours .
Such events are infrequent if vancomycin hydrochloride for injection is given by a slow infusion over 60 minutes .
In studies of normal volunteers , infusion - related events did not occur when vancomycin hydrochloride for injection was administered at a rate of 10 mg / min or less .
Nephrotoxicity Renal failure , principally manifested by increased serum creatinine or BUN concentrations , especially in patients administered large doses of vancomycin , has been reported rarely .
Cases of interstitial nephritis have also been reported rarely .
Most of these have occurred in patients who were given aminoglycosides concomitantly or who had preexisting kidney dysfunction .
When vancomycin was discontinued , azotemia resolved in most patients .
Gastrointestinal Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment ( see WARNINGS ) .
Ototoxicity A few dozen cases of hearing loss associated with vancomycin have been reported .
Most of these patients had kidney dysfunction or a preexisting hearing loss or were receiving concomitant treatment with an ototoxic drug .
Vertigo , dizziness , and tinnitus have been reported rarely .
Hematopoietic Reversible neutropenia , usually starting 1 week or more after onset of therapy with vancomycin or after a total dosage of more than 25 g , has been reported for several dozen patients .
Neutropenia appears to be promptly reversible when vancomycin is discontinued .
Thrombocytopenia has rarely been reported .
Although a causal relationship has not been established , reversible agranulocytosis ( granulocytes < 500 / mm3 ) has been reported rarely .
Phlebitis Inflammation at the injection site has been reported .
Miscellaneous Infrequently , patients have been reported to have had anaphylaxis , drug fever , nausea , chills , eosinophilia , rashes including exfoliative dermatitis , linear IgA bullous dermatosis , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis and vasculitis in association with the administration of vancomycin .
Chemical peritonitis has been reported following intraperitoneal administration ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
POST MARKETING REPORTS The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of vancomycin .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms ( DRESS ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS , contact AuroMedics Pharma LLC at 1 - 866 - 850 - 2876 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov .
OVERDOSAGE Supportive care is advised , with maintenance of glomerular filtration .
Vancomycin is poorly removed by dialysis .
Hemofiltration and hemoperfusion with polysulfone resin have been reported to result in increased vancomycin clearance .
The median lethal intravenous dose is 319 mg / kg in rats and 400 mg / kg in mice .
To obtain up - to - date information about the treatment of overdose , a good resource is your certified Regional Poison Control Center .
Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians ’ Desk Reference ( PDR ) .
In managing overdosage , consider the possibility of multiple drug overdoses , interaction among drugs , and unusual drug kinetics in your patient .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Infusion - related events are related to both the concentration and the rate of administration of vancomycin .
Concentrations of no more than 5 mg / mL and rates of no more than 10 mg / min , are recommended in adults ( see also age - specific recommendations ) .
In selected patients in need of fluid restriction , a concentration up to 10 mg / mL may be used ; use of such higher concentrations may increase the risk of infusion - related events .
An infusion rate of 10 mg / min or less is associated with fewer infusion - related events ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
Infusion - related events may occur , however , at any rate or concentration .
Patients With Normal Renal Function Adults The usual daily intravenous dose is 2 g divided either as 500 mg every 6 hours or 1 g every 12 hours .
Each dose should be administered at no more than 10 mg / min or over a period of at least 60 minutes , whichever is longer .
Other patient factors , such as age or obesity , may call for modification of the usual intravenous daily dose .
Pediatric patients The usual intravenous dosage of vancomycin is 10 mg / kg per dose given every 6 hours .
Each dose should be administered over a period of at least 60 minutes .
Close monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin may be warranted in these patients .
Neonates In pediatric patients up to the age of 1 month , the total daily intravenous dosage may be lower .
In neonates , an initial dose of 15 mg / kg is suggested , followed by 10 mg / kg every 12 hours for neonates in the 1 st week of life and every 8 hours thereafter up to the age of 1 month .
Each dose should be administered over 60 minutes .
In premature infants , vancomycin clearance decreases as postconceptional age decreases .
Therefore , longer dosing intervals may be necessary in premature infants .
Close monitoring of serum concentrations of vancomycin is recommended in these patients .
Patients With Impaired Renal Function and Elderly Patients Dosage adjustment must be made in patients with impaired renal function .
In premature infants and the elderly , greater dosage reductions than expected may be necessary because of decreased renal function .
Measurement of vancomycin serum concentrations can be helpful in optimizing therapy , especially in seriously ill patients with changing renal function .
Vancomycin serum concentrations can be determined by use of microbiologic assay , radioimmunoassay , fluorescence polarization immunoassay , fluorescence immunoassay , or high - pressure liquid chromatography .
If creatinine clearance can be measured or estimated accurately , the dosage for most patients with renal impairment can be calculated using the following table .
The dosage of vancomycin hydrochloride for injection per day in mg is about 15 times the glomerular filtration rate in mL / min ( see following table ) .
DOSAGE TABLE FOR VANCOMYCIN IN PATIENTS WITH IMPAIRED RENAL FUNCTION ( Adapted from Moellering et al . 1 ) Creatinine Clearance mL / min Vancomycin Dose mg / 24 h 100 1 , 545 90 1 , 390 80 1 , 235 70 1 , 080 60 925 50 770 40 620 30 465 20 310 10 155 The initial dose should be no less than 15 mg / kg , even in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency .
The table is not valid for functionally anephric patients .
For such patients , an initial dose of 15 mg / kg of body weight should be given to achieve prompt therapeutic serum concentrations .
The dose required to maintain stable concentrations is 1 . 9 mg / kg / 24 hr .
In patients with marked renal impairment , it may be more convenient to give maintenance doses of 250 to 1 , 000 mg once every several days rather than administering the drug on a daily basis .
In anuria , a dose of 1 , 000 mg every 7 to 10 days has been recommended .
When only serum creatinine is known , the following formula ( based on sex , weight and age of the patient ) may be used to calculate creatinine clearance .
Calculated creatinine clearances ( mL / min ) are only estimates .
The creatinine clearance should be measured promptly .
Men : [ Weight ( kg ) x ( 140 – age in years ) ] 72 x serum creatinine concentration ( mg / dL ) Women : 0 . 85 x above value The serum creatinine must represent a steady state of renal function .
Otherwise , the estimated value for creatinine clearance is not valid .
Such a calculated clearance is an overestimate of actual clearance in patients with conditions : ( 1 ) characterized by decreasing renal function , such as shock , severe heart failure , or oliguria ; ( 2 ) in which a normal relationship between muscle mass and total body weight is not present , such as in obese patients or those with liver disease , edema , or ascites ; and ( 3 ) accompanied by debilitation , malnutrition , or inactivity .
The safety and efficacy of vancomycin administration by the intrathecal ( intralumbar or intraventricular ) routes have not been established .
Intermittent infusion is the recommended method of administration .
Compatibility with Other Drugs and IV Fluids The following diluents are physically and chemically compatible ( with 4 g / L vancomycin hydrochloride ) : 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP 5 % Dextrose Injection and 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP Lactated Ringer ’ s Injection , USP 5 % Dextrose and Lactated Ringer ’ s Injection Normosol ® - M and 5 % Dextrose 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP Isolyte ® E Good professional practice suggests that compounded admixtures should be administered as soon after preparation as is feasible .
Vancomycin solution has a low pH and may cause physical instability of other compounds .
