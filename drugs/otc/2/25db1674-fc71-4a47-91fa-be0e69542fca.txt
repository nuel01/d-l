When you put on a NicoDerm CQ patch , nicotine passes through the skin and into your body .
NicoDermCQ is very thin and uses special material to control how fast nicotine passes through the skin .
Unlike the sudden jolts of nicotine delivered by cigarettes , the amount of nicotine you receive remains relatively smooth throughout the 16 or 24 hour period you wear the NicoDermCQ patch .
This helps to reduce cravings you may have for nicotine .
