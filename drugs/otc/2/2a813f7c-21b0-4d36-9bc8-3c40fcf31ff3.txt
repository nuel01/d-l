( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Thrombocytopenia : Monitor platelet counts before ZOLGENSMA infusion , and weekly for the first month and then every other week for the second and third month until platelet counts return to baseline .
( 2 . 3 , 5 . 2 ) • Thrombotic Microangiopathy ( TMA ) : If clinical signs , symptoms and / or laboratory findings occur , consult a pediatric hematologist and / or pediatric nephrologist immediately to manage as clinically indicated .
( 5 . 3 ) • Elevated Troponin - I : Monitor troponin - I before ZOLGENSMA infusion , and weekly for the first month and then monthly for the second and third month until troponin - I level returns to baseline .
( 2 . 3 , 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Acute Serious Liver Injury , Acute Liver Failure or Elevated Aminotransferases Acute serious liver injury , acute liver failure and elevated aminotransferases can occur with ZOLGENSMA .
Hepatotoxicity ( which may be immune - mediated ) , generally manifested as elevated ALT and / or AST levels and at times as acute serious liver injury or acute liver failure , has been reported with ZOLGENSMA use [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
In order to mitigate potential aminotransferase elevations , administer systemic corticosteroid to all patients before and after ZOLGENSMA infusion .
Immune - mediated hepatotoxicity may require adjustment of the corticosteroid treatment regimen , including longer duration , increased dose , or prolongation of the corticosteroid taper [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Patients with preexisting liver impairment or acute hepatic viral infection may be at higher risk of acute serious liver injury / acute liver failure .
Patients with ALT , AST , or total bilirubin levels ( except due to neonatal jaundice ) > 2 × ULN have not been studied in clinical trials with ZOLGENSMA .
The risks and benefits of infusion with ZOLGENSMA in patients with preexisting liver impairment should be weighed carefully against the risks of not treating the patient .
Although in the clinical trials and in postmarketing experience , asymptomatic aminotransferase elevations were very commonly reported [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] , in the managed access program and in the postmarketing setting , cases of acute serious liver injury and acute liver failure have been reported .
Some patients have experienced elevations in ALT and AST > 20 × ULN , prolonged prothrombin time and have been symptomatic ( e . g . , vomiting , jaundice ) , which resolved with the use of prednisolone , sometimes requiring prolonged duration and / or a higher dose .
If acute serious liver injury or acute liver failure is suspected , consult a pediatric gastroenterologist or hepatologist .
Prior to ZOLGENSMA infusion , assess liver function by clinical examination and laboratory testing ( hepatic aminotransferases [ AST and ALT ] , total bilirubin level , and prothrombin time ) .
Continue to monitor liver function for at least 3 months after ZOLGENSMA infusion ( weekly for the first month , and then every other week for the second and third months , until results are unremarkable ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 2 Thrombocytopenia Transient decreases in platelet counts , some of which met the criteria for thrombocytopenia , were typically observed within the first two weeks after ZOLGENSMA infusion .
Monitor platelet counts before ZOLGENSMA infusion and on a regular basis afterwards ( weekly for the first month ; every other week for the second and third months until platelet counts return to baseline ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 3 Thrombotic Microangiopathy Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) were reported approximately one week after ZOLGENSMA infusion in the post - marketing setting [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 3 ) ] .
TMA is characterized by thrombocytopenia , microangiopathic hemolytic anemia , and acute kidney injury .
Concurrent immune system activation ( e . g . , infections , vaccinations ) was identified in some cases .
Monitor platelet counts [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] , as well as signs and symptoms of TMA , such as hypertension , increased bruising , seizures , or decreased urine output .
In case these signs and symptoms occur in the presence of thrombocytopenia , further diagnostic evaluation for hemolytic anemia and renal dysfunction should be undertaken .
If clinical signs , symptoms and / or laboratory findings consistent with TMA occur , consult a pediatric hematologist and / or pediatric nephrologist immediately to manage TMA as clinically indicated .
5 . 4 Elevated Troponin - I Increases in cardiac troponin - I levels ( up to 0 . 176 mcg / L ) were observed following ZOLGENSMA infusion in clinical trials .
The clinical importance of these findings is not known .
However , cardiac toxicity was observed in animal studies [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 2 ) ] .
Monitor troponin - I before ZOLGENSMA infusion and on a regular basis for at least 3 months afterwards ( weekly for the first month , and then monthly for the second and third months until troponin - I level returns to baseline ) .
Consider consultation with a cardiologist , if troponin elevations are accompanied by clinical signs or symptoms ( e . g . , heart rate changes , cyanosis , tachypnea and respiratory distress ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another product and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety data described in this section reflect exposure to ZOLGENSMA in four open - label studies conducted in the United States , including one completed clinical trial , two ongoing clinical trials , and one ongoing observational long - term follow - up study of the completed trial .
A total of 44 patients with SMA received intravenous infusion of ZOLGENSMA , 41 patients at or above the recommended dose , and 3 patients at a lower dose .
The patient population ranged in age from 0 . 3 months to 7 . 9 months at the time of infusion ( weight range 3 . 0 kg to 8 . 4 kg ) .
The most frequent adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 5 % ) observed in the 4 studies are summarized in Table 2 .
Table 2 : Adverse Reactions Following Treatment With ZOLGENSMA ( N = 44 ) Adverse Reactions Patients n ( % ) Abbreviation : ULN , upper limit of normal .
aElevated aminotransferases include elevation of alanine aminotransferase and / or aspartate aminotransferase .
bIn the completed clinical trial , one patient ( the first patient infused in that study ) was enrolled prior to the protocol amendment instituting administration of prednisolone before and after ZOLGENSMA infusion .
Elevated aminotransferasesab ( > ULN ) 12 ( 27 . 3 % ) Vomiting 3 ( 6 . 8 % ) One patient in an ongoing non - United States clinical trial initially presented with respiratory insufficiency 12 days after ZOLGENSMA infusion and was found to have respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) and parainfluenza in respiratory secretions .
The patient had episodes of serious hypotension , followed by seizures , and was found to have leukoencephalopathy ( brain white matter defects ) approximately 30 days after ZOLGENSMA infusion .
The patient died after withdrawal of life support 52 days after ZOLGENSMA infusion .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity In ZOLGENSMA clinical trials , patients were required to have baseline anti - AAV9 antibody titers of ≤ 1 : 50 , measured using an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) .
Evidence of prior exposure to AAV9 was uncommon .
The safety and efficacy of ZOLGENSMA in patients with anti - AAV9 antibody titers above 1 : 50 have not been evaluated .
Perform baseline testing for the presence of anti - AAV9 antibodies prior to ZOLGENSMA infusion .
Retesting may be performed if anti - AAV9 antibody titers are reported as > 1 : 50 [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 3 ) ] .
Following ZOLGENSMA infusion , increases from baseline in anti - AAV9 antibody titers occurred in all patients .
In the completed clinical trial , anti - AAV9 antibody titers reached at least 1 : 102 , 400 in every patient , and titers exceeded 1 : 819 , 200 in most patients .
Re - administration of ZOLGENSMA in the presence of high anti - AAV9 antibody titer has not been evaluated .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of ZOLGENSMA .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : thrombotic microangiopathy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] , thrombocytopenia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Hepatobiliary Disorders : acute liver failure , acute liver injury [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .

11 DESCRIPTION ZOLGENSMA is a suspension of an adeno - associated viral vector - based gene therapy for intravenous infusion .
It is a recombinant self - complementary AAV9 containing a transgene encoding the human survival motor neuron ( SMN ) protein , under the control of a cytomegalovirus enhancer / chicken - β - actin hybrid promoter .
ZOLGENSMA has a nominal concentration of 2 . 0 × 1013 vg / mL .
Each vial contains an extractable volume of not less than either 5 . 5 mL or 8 . 3 mL and the excipients 20 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 1 mM magnesium chloride ( MgCl2 ) , 200 mM sodium chloride ( NaCl ) and 0 . 005 % poloxamer 188 .
ZOLGENSMA is packaged as a sterile suspension and contains no preservative .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Onasemnogene abeparvovec is a recombinant AAV9 - based gene therapy designed to deliver a copy of the gene encoding the human SMN protein .
SMA is caused by a bi - allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene , which results in insufficient SMN protein expression .
Intravenous administration of ZOLGENSMA that results in cell transduction and expression of the SMN protein has been observed in two human case studies [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics There are no clinically relevant pharmacodynamics data for onasemnogene abeparvovec .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Vector shedding after infusion with onasemnogene abeparvovec was investigated at multiple time points during the completed clinical trial .
Samples of saliva , urine and stool were collected the day after infusion , weekly through Day 30 , and then monthly through Month 12 and every 3 months thereafter .
Samples from 5 patients were used for onasemnogene abeparvovec vector DNA shedding analysis through the Month 18 visit .
Vector DNA was shed in saliva , urine and stool after infusion of onasemnogene abeparvovec , with much higher concentrations of vector DNA found in stool than in saliva or urine .
The vector DNA concentration in saliva was low on Day 1 after infusion and declined to undetectable levels within 3 weeks .
In urine , the vector DNA concentration was very low on Day 1 after infusion and declined to undetectable levels within 1 to 2 weeks .
In stool , the vector DNA concentration was much higher than in saliva or urine for 1 to 2 weeks after infusion and declined to undetectable levels by 1 to 2 months after infusion .
Biodistribution was evaluated in two patients who died 5 . 7 months and 1 . 7 months , respectively , after infusion of onasemnogene abeparvovec at the dose of 1 . 1 x 1014 vg / kg .
Both cases showed that the highest levels of vector DNA were found in the liver .
Vector DNA was also detected in the spleen , heart , pancreas , inguinal lymph node , skeletal muscles , peripheral nerves , kidney , lung , intestines , gonads , spinal cord , brain , and thymus .
Immunostaining for SMN protein showed generalized SMN expression in spinal motor neurons , neuronal and glial cells of the brain , and in the heart , liver , skeletal muscles , and other tissues evaluated .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No animal studies have been performed to evaluate the effects of onasemnogene abeparvovec on carcinogenesis , mutagenesis or impairment of fertility .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology In toxicology studies conducted in neonatal mice , dose - dependent cardiac and hepatic toxicities were observed following intravenous administration of onasemnogene abeparvovec .
Onasemnogene abeparvovec - related findings in the myocardium , at doses of 7 . 9 × 1013 vg / kg and higher , included slight to mild mononuclear cell inflammation accompanied by edema , slight to mild fibrosis , and scattered myocardial cell degeneration / regeneration .
Additional cardiac findings at dose levels of 1 . 5 × 1014 vg / kg and higher included minimal to moderate atrial thrombosis and slight to marked atrial dilation .
Liver findings included hepatocellular hypertrophy , Kupffer cell activation , perinuclear vacuolation , and scattered hepatocellular necrosis .
Target organ toxicity in the heart and liver was associated with mortality in mice at dose levels of 2 . 4 × 1014 vg / kg and above , approximately 2 . 2 - fold higher than the recommended clinical dose level .
In a 6 - month toxicology study conducted in juvenile non - human primates , single intravenous administration of onasemnogene abeparvovec at the recommended clinical dose level of 1 . 1 × 1014 vg / kg , with or without corticosteroid treatment , resulted in microscopic findings in the dorsal root ganglia ( DRG ) , trigeminal ganglia ( TG ) , spinal cord , brainstem , and liver .
At 6 weeks post - administration , microscopic findings included minimal to slight mononuclear cell inflammation and neuronal degeneration in the DRG and TG ; axonal degeneration and gliosis in the spinal cord ; mixed cell inflammation , gliosis , and axonal degeneration in the brainstem ; and oval cell hyperplasia in the liver .
These microscopic findings were still present at 6 months with decreased severity and incidence .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of ZOLGENSMA in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age with SMA with bi - allelic mutations in the SMN1 gene was evaluated in an open - label , single - arm clinical trial ( ongoing ) and an open - label , single - arm , ascending - dose clinical trial ( completed ) .
Patients experienced onset of clinical symptoms consistent with SMA before 6 months of age .
All patients had genetically confirmed bi - allelic SMN1 gene deletions , 2 copies of the SMN2 gene , and absence of the c . 859 G > C modification in exon 7 of SMN2 gene ( which predicts a milder phenotype ) .
All patients had baseline anti - AAV9 antibody titers of ≤ 1 : 50 , measured by ELISA .
In both trials , ZOLGENSMA was delivered as a single - dose intravenous infusion .
Efficacy was established on the basis of survival , and achievement of developmental motor milestones , such as sitting without support .
Survival was defined as time from birth to either death or permanent ventilation .
Permanent ventilation was defined as requiring invasive ventilation ( tracheostomy ) , or respiratory assistance for 16 or more hours per day ( including noninvasive ventilatory support ) continuously for 14 or more days in the absence of an acute reversible illness , excluding perioperative ventilation .
Efficacy was also supported by assessments of ventilator use , nutritional support and scores on the Children ' s Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders ( CHOP - INTEND ) .
CHOP - INTEND is an assessment of motor skills in patients with infantile - onset SMA .
The ongoing clinical trial enrolled 21 patients ( 10 male and 11 female ) with infantile - onset SMA .
Before treatment with ZOLGENSMA , none of the 21 patients required noninvasive ventilator ( NIV ) support , and all patients could exclusively feed orally ( i . e . , no need for non - oral nutrition ) .
The mean CHOP - INTEND score at baseline was 31 . 0 ( range 18 to 47 ) .
All the patients received 1 . 1 × 1014 vg / kg of ZOLGENSMA .
The mean age of the 21 patients at the time of treatment was 3 . 9 months ( range 0 . 5 to 5 . 9 months ) .
As of the March 2019 data cutoff , 19 patients were alive without permanent ventilation ( i . e . , event - free survival ) and were continuing in the trial , while one patient died at age 7 . 8 months due to disease progression , and one patient withdrew from the study at age 11 . 9 months .
The 19 surviving patients who were continuing in the trial ranged in age from 9 . 4 to 18 . 5 months .
By the data cutoff , 13 of the 19 patients continuing in the trial reached 14 months of age without permanent ventilation , one of the study ’ s co - primary efficacy endpoints .
In addition to survival , assessment of the other co - primary efficacy endpoint found that 10 of the 21 patients ( 47 . 6 % ) achieved the ability to sit without support for ≥ 30 seconds between 9 . 2 and 16 . 9 months of age ( mean age was 12 . 1 months ) .
Based on the natural history of the disease , patients who met the study entry criteria would not be expected to attain the ability to sit without support , and only approximately 25 % of these patients would be expected to survive ( i . e . , being alive without permanent ventilation ) beyond 14 months of age .
In addition , 16 of the 19 patients had not required daily NIV use .
Comparison of the results of the ongoing clinical trial to available natural history data of patients with infantile - onset SMA provides primary evidence of the effectiveness of ZOLGENSMA .
The completed clinical trial enrolled 15 patients ( 6 male and 9 female ) with infantile - onset SMA , 3 in a low - dose cohort and 12 in a high - dose cohort .
At the time of treatment , the mean age of patients in the low - dose cohort was 6 . 3 months ( range 5 . 9 to 7 . 2 months ) , and 3 . 4 months ( range 0 . 9 to 7 . 9 months ) in the high - dose cohort .
The dosage received by patients in the low - dose cohort was approximately one - third of the dosage received by patients in the high - dose cohort .
However , the precise dosages of ZOLGENSMA received by patients in this completed clinical trial are unclear due to a change in the method of measuring ZOLGENSMA concentration , and to decreases in the concentration of stored ZOLGENSMA over time .
The retrospectively - estimated dosage range in the high - dose cohort is approximately 1 . 1 × 1014 to 1 . 4 × 1014 vg / kg .
By 24 months following ZOLGENSMA infusion , one patient in the low - dose cohort met the endpoint of permanent ventilation ; all 12 patients in the high - dose cohort were alive without permanent ventilation .
None of the patients in the low - dose cohort were able to sit without support , or to stand or walk ; in the high - dose cohort , 9 of the 12 patients ( 75 . 0 % ) were able to sit without support for ≥ 30 seconds , and 2 patients ( 16 . 7 % ) were able to stand and walk without assistance .
Comparison of the results of the low - dose cohort to the results of the high - dose cohort shows a dose - response relationship that supports the effectiveness of ZOLGENSMA .
