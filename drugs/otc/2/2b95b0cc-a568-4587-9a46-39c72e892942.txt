( 5 . 5 ) • • Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : XTANDI can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy .
Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception .
( 5 . 6 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Seizure Seizure occurred in 0 . 5 % of patients receiving XTANDI in seven randomized clinical trials .
In these trials , patients with predisposing factors for seizure were generally excluded .
Seizure occurred from 13 to 1776 days after initiation of XTANDI .
Patients experiencing seizure were permanently discontinued from therapy , and all seizure events resolved .
In a single - arm trial designed to assess the risk of seizure in patients with pre - disposing factors for seizure , 8 of 366 ( 2 . 2 % ) XTANDI - treated patients experienced a seizure .
Three of the 8 patients experienced a second seizure during continued treatment with XTANDI after their first seizure resolved .
It is unknown whether anti - epileptic medications will prevent seizures with XTANDI .
Patients in the study had one or more of the following pre - disposing factors : the use of medications that may lower the seizure threshold ( ~ 54 % ) , history of traumatic brain or head injury ( ~ 28 % ) , history of cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack ( ~ 24 % ) , and Alzheimer ’ s disease , meningioma , or leptomeningeal disease from prostate cancer , unexplained loss of consciousness within the last 12 months , past history of seizure , presence of a space occupying lesion of the brain , history of arteriovenous malformation , or history of brain infection ( all < 5 % ) .
Approximately 17 % of patients had more than one risk factor .
Advise patients of the risk of developing a seizure while receiving XTANDI and of engaging in any activity where sudden loss of consciousness could cause serious harm to themselves or others .
Permanently discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop a seizure during treatment .
5 . 2 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome ( PRES ) There have been reports of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( PRES ) in patients receiving XTANDI [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with rapidly evolving symptoms including seizure , headache , lethargy , confusion , blindness , and other visual and neurological disturbances , with or without associated hypertension .
A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging , preferably magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) .
Discontinue XTANDI in patients who develop PRES . 5 . 3 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions , including edema of the face ( 0 . 5 % ) , tongue ( 0 . 1 % ) , or lip ( 0 . 1 % ) have been observed with enzalutamide in seven randomized clinical trials .
Pharyngeal edema has been reported in post - marketing cases .
Advise patients who experience any symptoms of hypersensitivity to temporarily discontinue XTANDI and promptly seek medical care .
Permanently discontinue XTANDI for serious hypersensitivity reactions .
5 . 4 Ischemic Heart Disease In the combined data of four randomized , placebo - controlled clinical studies , ischemic heart disease occurred more commonly in patients on the XTANDI arm compared to patients on the placebo arm ( 2 . 9 % vs 1 . 3 % ) .
Grade 3 - 4 ischemic events occurred in 1 . 4 % of patients on the XTANDI arm compared to 0 . 7 % on the placebo arm .
Ischemic events led to death in 0 . 4 % of patients on the XTANDI arm compared to 0 . 1 % on the placebo arm .
Monitor for signs and symptoms of ischemic heart disease .
Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors , such as hypertension , diabetes , or dyslipidemia .
Discontinue XTANDI for Grade 3 - 4 ischemic heart disease .
5 . 5 Falls and Fractures Falls and fractures occurred in patients receiving XTANDI .
Evaluate patients for fracture and fall risk .
Monitor and manage patients at risk for fractures according to established treatment guidelines and consider use of bone - targeted agents .
In the combined data of four randomized , placebo - controlled clinical studies , falls occurred in 11 % of patients treated with XTANDI compared to 4 % of patients treated with placebo .
Falls were not associated with loss of consciousness or seizure .
Fractures occurred in 10 % of patients treated with XTANDI and in 4 % of patients treated with placebo .
Grade 3 - 4 fractures occurred in 3 % of patients treated with XTANDI and in 2 % of patients treated with placebo .
The median time to onset of fracture was 336 days ( range : 2 to 1914 days ) for patients treated with XTANDI .
Routine bone density assessment and treatment of osteoporosis with bone - targeted agents were not performed in the studies .
5 . 6 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity The safety and efficacy of XTANDI have not been established in females .
Based on animal reproductive studies and mechanism of action , XTANDI can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female .
Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XTANDI and for 3 months after the last dose of XTANDI [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .

Hypertension led to study discontinuation in < 1 % of patients in each arm .
6 . 2 Post - Marketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of XTANDI .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Gastrointestinal Disorders : vomiting Immune System Disorders : hypersensitivity ( edema of the face , tongue , lip , or pharynx ) Neurological Disorders : posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( PRES ) , dysgeusia Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : rash , severe cutaneous adverse reactions ( including Stevens - Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) , erythema multiforme , toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis ( AGEP ) ) 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • • Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors : Avoid strong CYP2C8 inhibitors .
If coadministration cannot be avoided , reduce the dosage of XTANDI .
( 2 . 3 , 7 . 1 ) • • Strong CYP3A4 Inducers : Avoid strong CYP3A4 inducers .
If coadministration cannot be avoided , increase the dosage of XTANDI .
( 2 . 3 , 7 . 1 ) • • Avoid coadministration with certain CYP3A4 , CYP2C9 , or CYP2C19 substrates for which a minimal decrease in concentration may lead to therapeutic failure of the substrate .
In cases where active metabolites are formed , there may be increased exposure to the active metabolites .
( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Effect of Other Drugs on XTANDI Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors The coadministration of XTANDI with gemfibrozil ( a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor ) increases plasma concentrations of enzalutamide plus N - desmethyl enzalutamide , which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of XTANDI .
Avoid the coadministration of XTANDI with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors .
If the coadministration of XTANDI with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor cannot be avoided , reduce the dosage of XTANDI [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Strong CYP3A4 Inducers The coadministration of XTANDI with rifampin ( a strong CYP3A4 inducer and a moderate CYP2C8 inducer ) decreases plasma concentrations of enzalutamide plus N - desmethyl enzalutamide , which may decrease the efficacy of XTANDI .
Avoid the coadministration of XTANDI with strong CYP3A4 inducers .
If the coadministration of XTANDI with a strong CYP3A4 inducer cannot be avoided , increase the dosage of XTANDI [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Effect of XTANDI on Other Drugs Certain CYP3A4 , CYP2C9 , or CYP2C19 Substrates XTANDI is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and a moderate CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inducer .
The coadministration of XTANDI decreases the concentrations of certain CYP3A4 , CYP2C9 , or CYP2C19 substrates [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates .
Avoid the coadministration of XTANDI with certain CYP3A4 , CYP2C9 , or CYP2C19 substrates for which a minimal decrease in concentration may lead to therapeutic failure of the substrate .
If the coadministration cannot be avoided , increase the dosage of these substrates in accordance with their Prescribing Information .
In cases where active metabolites are formed , there may be increased exposure to the active metabolites .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The safety and efficacy of XTANDI have not been established in females .
Based on animal reproductive studies and mechanism of action , XTANDI can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy .
There are no human data on the use of XTANDI in pregnant females .
In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of enzalutamide in pregnant mice during organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at doses lower than the maximum recommended human dose ( see Data ) .
Data Animal Data In an embryo - fetal developmental toxicity study in mice , enzalutamide caused developmental toxicity when administered at oral doses of 10 or 30 mg / kg / day throughout the period of organogenesis ( gestational days 6 - 15 ) .
Findings included embryo - fetal lethality ( increased post - implantation loss and resorptions ) and decreased anogenital distance at ≥ 10 mg / kg / day , and cleft palate and absent palatine bone at 30 mg / kg / day .
Doses of 30 mg / kg / day caused maternal toxicity .
The doses tested in mice ( 1 , 10 and 30 mg / kg / day ) resulted in systemic exposures ( AUC ) approximately 0 . 04 , 0 . 4 and 1 . 1 times , respectively , the exposures in patients .
Enzalutamide did not cause developmental toxicity in rabbits when administered throughout the period of organogenesis ( gestational days 6 - 18 ) at dose levels up to 10 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 4 times the exposures in patients based on AUC ) .
In a pharmacokinetic study in pregnant rats with a single oral 30 mg / kg enzalutamide administration on gestation day 14 , enzalutamide and / or its metabolites were present in the fetus at a Cmax that was approximately 0 . 3 times the concentration found in maternal plasma and occurred 4 hours after administration .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary The safety and efficacy of XTANDI have not been established in females .
There is no information available on the presence of XTANDI in human milk , the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant , or the effects of the drug on milk production .
Enzalutamide and / or its metabolites were present in milk of lactating rats ( see Data ) .
Data Following a single oral administration in lactating rats on postnatal day 14 , enzalutamide and / or its metabolites were present in milk at a Cmax that was 4 times higher than concentrations in the plasma and occurred 4 hours after administration .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Males Based on findings in animal reproduction studies , advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the last dose of XTANDI [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Males Based on animal studies , XTANDI may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of XTANDI in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of 4081 patients who received XTANDI in seven randomized , controlled clinical trials , 78 % were 65 and over , while 35 % were 75 and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dosage modification is recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance [ CLcr ] ≥ 30 mL / min ) .
XTANDI has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) or end - stage renal disease [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage modification is recommended for patients with mild , moderate , or severe hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of an overdosage , stop treatment with XTANDI and initiate general supportive measures taking into consideration the half - life of 5 . 8 days .
In a dose escalation study , no seizures were reported at < 240 mg daily , whereas 3 seizures were reported , 1 each at 360 mg , 480 mg , and 600 mg daily .
Patients may be at increased risk of seizure following an overdosage .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor that acts on different steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway .
Enzalutamide has been shown to competitively inhibit androgen binding to androgen receptors ; and consequently , inhibits nuclear translocation of androgen receptors and their interaction with DNA .
A major metabolite , N ‑ desmethyl enzalutamide , exhibited similar in vitro activity to enzalutamide .
Enzalutamide decreased proliferation and induced cell death of prostate cancer cells in vitro , and decreased tumor volume in a mouse prostate cancer xenograft model .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Once daily dosing of 160 mg enzalutamide in addition to ADT reduced PSA levels to undetectable levels ( < 0 . 2 ng / mL ) in 68 % of patients with mCSPC ( ARCHES ) .
Based on the efficacy results of AFFIRM after once daily dosing of 160 mg enzalutamide , no exposure ‑ response relationship for the efficacy endpoint of overall survival could be identified .
In addition , there was no clinically meaningful exposure - response relationship for adverse effects ( e . g . fatigue , flushing , headache , or hypertension ) within the limited exposure range for 160 mg / day .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At the recommended dosage , XTANDI does not cause large mean increases ( i . e . , > 20 msec ) in the QT interval .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Enzalutamide achieves steady - state by Day 28 and its AUC accumulates approximately 8 . 3 - fold relative to a single dose .
At steady - state , the mean ( % CV ) maximum concentration ( Cmax ) for enzalutamide and N - desmethyl enzalutamide are 16 . 6 µg / mL ( 23 % ) and 12 . 7 µg / mL ( 30 % ) , respectively , and the mean ( % CV ) minimum concentrations ( Cmin ) are 11 . 4 µg / mL ( 26 % ) and 13 . 0 µg / mL ( 30 % ) , respectively .
Enzalutamide showed approximately dose proportional pharmacokinetics over the daily dose range of 30 ( 0 . 2 times the approved recommended dosage ) to 360 mg ( 2 . 25 times the approved recommended dosage ) .
Absorption The median Tmax is 1 hour ( 0 . 5 to 3 hours ) following a single 160 mg dose of capsules and 2 hours ( 0 . 5 to 6 hours ) following a single 160 mg dose of tablets .
Effect of Food There was no clinically meaningful effect on enzalutamide or N - desmethyl enzalutamide pharmacokinetics following the administration of XTANDI with a high ‑ fat meal ( approximately 150 calories from protein , 250 calories from carbohydrates , and 500 to 600 calories from fat ) .
Distribution The mean ( % CV ) volume of distribution after a single oral dose is 110 L ( 29 % ) .
Enzalutamide is 97 % to 98 % bound to plasma proteins , primarily albumin .
N - desmethyl enzalutamide is 95 % bound to plasma proteins .
Elimination Enzalutamide is primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism .
The mean apparent clearance ( CL / F ) of enzalutamide after a single dose is 0 . 56 L / h ( 0 . 33 to 1 . 02 L / h ) .
The mean terminal half - life ( t1 / 2 ) for enzalutamide after a single oral dose is 5 . 8 days ( 2 . 8 to 10 . 2 days ) .
The mean terminal t1 / 2 for N ‑ desmethyl enzalutamide is approximately 7 . 8 to 8 . 6 days .
Metabolism Enzalutamide is metabolized by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 .
CYP2C8 is primarily responsible for the formation of the active metabolite ( N - desmethyl enzalutamide ) .
Carboxylesterase 1 metabolizes N - desmethyl enzalutamide and enzalutamide to the inactive carboxylic acid metabolite .
Specific Populations No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide were observed based on age ( 41 to 92 years ) , race ( White , Chinese , and Japanese ) , body weight ( 46 kg to 163 kg ) , mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr ≥ 30 mL / min ) and hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh A , B , and C ) .
Severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) have not been studied .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of CYP2C8 Inhibitors on XTANDI : The coadministration of XTANDI 160 mg with gemfibrozil ( strong CYP2C8 inhibitor ) increased the AUC of enzalutamide plus N - desmethyl enzalutamide by 2 . 2 - fold with minimal effect on Cmax .
Effect of CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 Inducers on XTANDI : The coadministration of XTANDI 160 mg after multiple oral doses of rifampin ( strong CYP3A4 and moderate CYP2C8 inducer ) decreased the AUC of enzalutamide plus N - desmethyl enzalutamide by 37 % with no effect on Cmax .
Effect of CYP3A4 Inhibitors on XTANDI : The coadministration of XTANDI 160 mg after multiple oral doses of itraconazole ( strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ) increased the AUC of enzalutamide plus N - desmethyl enzalutamide by 1 . 3 - fold with no effect on Cmax .
Effect of XTANDI on Other Drugs : The coadministration of XTANDI 160 mg orally once daily with midazolam ( a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate ) decreased midazolam AUC by 86 % and Cmax by 77 % .
Coadministration of XTANDI 160 mg orally once daily with warfarin ( a sensitive CYP2C9 substrate ) decreased S ‑ warfarin AUC by 56 % and Cmax by 17 % .
Coadministration of XTANDI 160 mg orally once daily with omeprazole ( a sensitive CYP2C19 substrate ) decreased omeprazole AUC by 72 % and Cmax by 62 % .
Coadministration of XTANDI 160 mg orally once daily with digoxin ( a P - glycoprotein substrate ) increased digoxin AUC by 33 % and Cmax by 17 % .
No clinically meaningful changes in exposure of pioglitazone ( a sensitive CYP2C8 substrate ) , caffeine ( a sensitive CYP1A2 substrate ) , dextromethorphan ( a sensitive CYP2D6 substrate ) , or rosuvastatin ( a BCRP substrate ) were observed following coadministration with XTANDI .
In Vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) Enzymes : Enzalutamide induces CYP2B6 at clinically achievable concentrations .
Transporter Systems : Enzalutamide , N - desmethyl enzalutamide , and the major inactive carboxylic acid metabolite are not substrates for P - glycoprotein or BCRP .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility A two - year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats at oral enzalutamide doses of 10 , 30 , and 100 mg / kg / day .
Enzalutamide increased the incidence of benign Leydig cell tumors in the testes at all dose levels tested ( ≥ 0 . 3 times the human exposure based on AUC ) and combined incidence of urothelial papilloma and carcinoma in the urinary bladder in male rats at 100 mg / kg / day ( 1 . 4 times the human exposure based on AUC ) .
The findings in the testes are considered to be related to the pharmacological activity of enzalutamide .
Rats are regarded as more sensitive than humans to developing interstitial cell tumors in the testes .
Administration of enzalutamide to male and female rasH2 transgenic mice by oral gavage daily for 26 weeks did not result in increased incidence of neoplasms at doses up to 20 mg / kg / day .
Enzalutamide did not induce mutations in the bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay and was not genotoxic in either the in vitro mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase ( Tk ) gene mutation assay or the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
Based on nonclinical findings in repeat - dose toxicology studies , which were consistent with the pharmacological activity of enzalutamide , male fertility may be impaired by treatment with XTANDI .
In a 26 - week study in rats , atrophy of the prostate and seminal vesicles was observed at ≥ 30 mg / kg / day ( equal to the human exposure based on AUC ) .
In 4 - , 13 - , and 39 - week studies in dogs , hypospermatogenesis and atrophy of the prostate and epididymides were observed at ≥ 4 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 3 times the human exposure based on AUC ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of XTANDI in patients with CRPC ( N = 4692 ) or mCSPC ( N = 1150 ) was demonstrated in five randomized , multicenter clinical trials .
All patients received concomitant GnRH therapy or had prior bilateral orchiectomy .
Patients were allowed , but not required , to continue or initiate glucocorticoids .
AFFIRM ( NCT00974311 ) : XTANDI versus Placebo in Metastatic CRPC Following Chemotherapy In AFFIRM , a total of 1199 patients who had received prior docetaxel - based chemotherapy were randomized 2 : 1 to receive either XTANDI orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily ( N = 800 ) or placebo orally once daily ( N = 399 ) .
Study treatment continued until disease progression ( evidence of radiographic progression , a skeletal - related event , or clinical progression ) , initiation of new systemic antineoplastic treatment , unacceptable toxicity , or withdrawal .
Patients with a previous history of seizure , taking medicines known to decrease the seizure threshold , or with other risk factors for seizure were not eligible [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The following patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms .
The median age was 69 years ( range 41 - 92 ) and the racial distribution was 92 . 7 % White , 3 . 9 % Black , 1 . 1 % Asian , and 2 . 1 % Other .
Ninety - two percent of patients had an ECOG performance status score of 0 - 1 and 28 % had a mean Brief Pain Inventory score of ≥ 4 .
Ninety - one percent of patients had metastases in bone and 23 % had visceral involvement in the lung and / or liver .
Fifty - nine percent of patients had radiographic evidence of disease progression and 41 % had PSA - only progression on study entry .
All patients had received prior docetaxel - based therapy and 24 % had received two cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens .
During the trial , 48 % of patients on the XTANDI arm and 46 % of patients on the placebo arm received glucocorticoids .
A statistically significant improvement in overall survival was demonstrated at the pre - specified interim analysis at the time of 520 deaths in patients on the XTANDI arm compared to patients on the placebo arm ( Table 7 and Figure 1 ) .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] PREVAIL ( NCT01212991 ) : XTANDI versus Placebo in Chemotherapy - naïve Metastatic CRPC In PREVAIL , 1717 chemotherapy - naïve patients were randomized 1 : 1 to receive either XTANDI orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily ( N = 872 ) or placebo orally once daily ( N = 845 ) .
Patients with visceral metastases , patients with a history of mild to moderate heart failure ( NYHA class I or II ) , and patients taking medications associated with lowering the seizure threshold were allowed .
Patients with a previous history of seizure or a condition that might predispose to seizure and patients with moderate or severe pain from prostate cancer were excluded .
Study treatment continued until disease progression ( evidence of radiographic progression , a skeletal - related event , or clinical progression ) and the initiation of a cytotoxic chemotherapy or an investigational agent , unacceptable toxicity , or withdrawal .
Overall survival and radiographic progression - free survival ( rPFS ) were assessed .
Radiographic progression was assessed with the use of sequential imaging and was defined by bone scan identification of 2 or more new bone lesions with confirmation ( Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 criteria ) and / or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST v 1 . 1 ) criteria for progression of soft tissue lesions .
The primary analysis of rPFS utilized centrally reviewed radiographic assessment of progression .
Patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms at entry .
The median age was 71 years ( range 42 - 93 ) and the racial distribution was 77 % White , 10 % Asian , 2 % Black and 11 % Other .
The ECOG performance status score was 0 for 68 % of patients , and 1 for 32 % of patients .
Baseline pain assessment was 0 - 1 ( asymptomatic ) in 67 % of patients , and 2 - 3 ( mildly symptomatic ) in 32 % of patients as defined by the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form ( worst pain over past 24 hours at study entry ) .
Fifty - four percent of patients had radiographic evidence of disease progression and 43 % had PSA - only progression .
Twelve percent of patients had visceral ( lung and / or liver ) disease involvement .
During the study , 27 % of patients on the XTANDI arm and 30 % of patients on the placebo arm received glucocorticoids for varying reasons .
A statistically significant improvement in overall survival was demonstrated at the pre - specified interim analysis , conducted after 540 deaths , in patients treated with XTANDI compared to those treated with placebo ( Table 8 ) .
Forty percent of XTANDI - treated and 70 % of placebo - treated patients received subsequent therapies for metastatic CRPC that may prolong overall survival .
An updated survival analysis was conducted when 784 deaths were observed .
The median follow - up time was 31 months .
Results from this analysis were consistent with those from the pre - specified interim analysis ( Table 8 , Figure 2 ) .
At the updated analysis , 52 % of XTANDI - treated and 81 % of placebo - treated patients had received subsequent therapies that may prolong overall survival in metastatic CRPC .
XTANDI was used as a subsequent therapy in 2 % of XTANDI - treated patients and 29 % of placebo - treated patients .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] Time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy was prolonged after XTANDI treatment , with a median of 28 . 0 months for patients on the XTANDI arm versus a median of 10 . 8 months for patients on the placebo arm [ HR = 0 . 35 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 30 , 0 . 40 ) , p < 0 . 0001 ] .
The median time to first skeletal ‑ related event was 31 . 1 months for patients on the XTANDI arm versus 31 . 3 months for patients on the placebo arm [ HR = 0 . 72 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 61 , 0 . 84 ) , p < 0 . 0001 ] .
A skeletal ‑ related event was defined as radiation therapy or surgery to bone for prostate cancer , pathologic bone fracture , spinal cord compression , or change of antineoplastic therapy to treat bone pain .
TERRAIN ( NCT01288911 ) : XTANDI versus Bicalutamide in Chemotherapy - naïve Metastatic CRPC TERRAIN was conducted in 375 chemotherapy - naïve patients who were randomized 1 : 1 to receive either XTANDI orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily ( N = 184 ) or bicalutamide orally at a dose of 50 mg once daily ( N = 191 ) .
Patients with a previous history of seizure or a condition that might predispose to seizure and patients with moderate to severe pain from prostate cancer were excluded .
Patients could have received prior bicalutamide , but those whose disease had progressed on prior antiandrogen therapy ( e . g . , bicalutamide ) were excluded .
Study treatment continued until disease progression ( evidence of radiographic progression , a skeletal - related event ) , the initiation of subsequent antineoplastic agent , unacceptable toxicity , or withdrawal .
Radiographic disease progression was assessed by Independent Central Review ( ICR ) using the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 criteria and / or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST v 1 . 1 ) criteria for progression of soft tissue lesions .
Radiographic progression - free survival ( rPFS ) was defined as the time from randomization to the first objective evidence of radiographic progression as assessed by ICR or death , whichever occurred first .
Patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms at entry .
The median age was 71 years ( range 48 - 96 ) and the racial distribution was 93 % White , 5 % Black , 1 % Asian and 1 % Other .
The ECOG performance status score was 0 for 74 % of patients and 1 for 26 % of patients .
Baseline pain assessment was 0 ‑ 1 ( asymptomatic ) in 58 % of patients , and 2 ‑ 3 ( mildly symptomatic ) in 36 % of patients as defined by the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form Question 3 ( worst pain over past 24 hours at study entry ) .
Ninety - eight percent of patients had objective evidence of disease progression at study entry .
Forty - six percent of patients had received prior treatment with bicalutamide while no patients received prior treatment with XTANDI .
An improvement in rPFS was demonstrated in patients treated with XTANDI compared to patients treated with bicalutamide ( Table 10 , Figure 4 ) .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] PROSPER ( NCT02003924 ) : XTANDI versus Placebo in Non - metastatic CRPC PROSPER enrolled 1401 patients with non - metastatic CRPC who were randomized 2 : 1 to receive either XTANDI orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily ( N = 933 ) or placebo orally once daily ( N = 468 ) .
All patients in the PROSPER trial received a gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) analog or had a prior bilateral orchiectomy .
Patients were stratified by Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) Doubling Time ( PSADT ) and the use of bone - targeting agents .
Patients were required to have a PSA doubling time ≤ 10 months , PSA ≥ 2 ng / mL , and confirmation of non - metastatic disease by blinded independent central review ( BICR ) .
PSA results were blinded and were not used for treatment discontinuation .
Patients randomized to either arm discontinued treatment for radiographic disease progression confirmed by BICR , initiation of new treatment , unacceptable toxicity , or withdrawal .
The following patient demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between the two treatment arms .
The median age at randomization was 74 years ( range 50 - 95 ) and 23 % were 80 years of age or older .
The racial distribution was 71 % White , 16 % Asian , and 2 % Black .
A majority of patients had a Gleason score of 7 or higher ( 77 % ) .
The median PSADT was 3 . 7 months .
Fifty - four percent ( 54 % ) of patients received prior treatment for prostate cancer with either surgery or radiation .
Sixty - three percent ( 63 % ) of patients received prior treatment with an anti - androgen ; 56 % of patients received bicalutamide and 11 % of patients received flutamide .
All patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ( ECOG PS ) score of 0 or 1 at study entry .
The major efficacy outcome of the study was metastasis - free survival ( MFS ) , defined as the time from randomization to whichever of the following occurred first 1 ) loco - regional and / or distant radiographic progression per BICR or 2 ) death up to 112 days after treatment discontinuation without evidence of radiographic progression .
A statistically significant improvement in MFS and OS was demonstrated in patients randomized to receive XTANDI compared with patients randomized to receive placebo .
Consistent MFS results were observed when considering only distant radiographic progression events or deaths regardless of the cut - off date .
Consistent MFS results were also observed in pre - specified and stratified patient sub - groups of PSADT ( < 6 months or ≥ 6 months ) and use of a prior bone - targeting agent ( yes or no ) .

ARCHES ( NCT02677896 ) : XTANDI versus Placebo in Metastatic CSPC ARCHES enrolled 1150 patients with mCSPC who were randomized 1 : 1 to receive XTANDI orally at a dose of 160 mg once daily ( N = 574 ) or placebo orally once daily ( N = 576 ) .
All patients in the trial received a GnRH analog or had a prior bilateral orchiectomy .
Patients were stratified by volume of disease ( low vs high ) and prior docetaxel therapy for prostate cancer ( no prior docetaxel , 1 - 5 cycles , or 6 prior cycles ) .
High volume of disease is defined as metastases involving the viscera or , in the absence of visceral lesions , there must be 4 or more bone lesions , at least 1 of which must be in a bony structure beyond the vertebral column and pelvic bone .
Treatment with concurrent docetaxel was not allowed .
Patients continued treatment until radiographic disease progression , initiation of new treatment , unacceptable toxicity , or withdrawal .
The following patient demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between the two treatment arms .
The median age at randomization was 70 years ( range : 42 - 92 ) and 30 % were 75 years of age or older .
The racial distribution was 81 % White , 14 % Asian , and 1 % Black .
Sixty - six percent ( 66 % ) of patients had a Gleason score of ≥ 8 .
Thirty - seven percent ( 37 % ) of patients had a low volume of disease and 63 % of patients had a high volume of disease .
Eighty - two percent ( 82 % ) of patients had no prior docetaxel treatment ; 2 % of patients had 1 to 5 cycles of docetaxel and 16 % of patients had 6 prior cycles of docetaxel treatment .
Twelve percent ( 12 % ) of patients received concomitant bone - targeted agents ( bisphosphonates or RANKL inhibitors ) which included both prostate and non - prostate cancer indications .
The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ( ECOG PS ) score was 0 for 78 % of patients and 1 for 22 % of patients at study entry .
The major efficacy outcome measure was radiographic progression - free survival ( rPFS ) based on blinded independent central review ( BICR ) .
Radiographic progression - free survival was defined as the time from randomization to radiographic disease progression at any time or death within 24 weeks after study drug discontinuation .
Radiographic disease progression was defined by identification of 2 or more new bone lesions on a bone scan with confirmation ( Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria ) and / or progression in soft tissue disease .
Time to new antineoplastic therapy and OS were additional efficacy endpoints .
XTANDI demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in rPFS and OS compared to placebo .
Consistent rPFS results were observed in patients with high or low volume of disease and patients with and without prior docetaxel therapy .
Efficacy results for rPFS and OS from ARCHES are summarized in Table 12 , Figure 7 and Figure 8 .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] A statistically significant improvement was also reported on the XTANDI arm compared to placebo in time to initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy ( HR = 0 . 28 [ 95 % CI : 0 . 20 , 0 . 40 ] ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .
