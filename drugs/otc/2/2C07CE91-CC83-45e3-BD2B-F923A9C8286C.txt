ADVERSE REACTIONS None reported .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Dosage The suggested dose range employed in the average patient ( 70 kg ) is as follows : Continuous intravenous infusion : 20 to 100 μCi ( 0 . 74 - 3 . 7 megabecquerels ) ( Sigman , et al ( 1 ) method ) .
Single intravenous injection : 10 to 30 μCi ( 0 . 37 - 1 . 11 megabecquerels ) ( Cohen , et al ( 2 ) method ) .
The patient dose should be measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration .
Technique Continuous intravenous infusion Sigman ( 1 ) method I . Preparation : • Adequate diuresis ( a urine flow exceeding 3 mL / min . )
is established , preferably by an oral water load of 1 , 500 mL two hours prior to the beginning of the clearance study .
• It is not necessary to withhold breakfast or admit the patient the night before .
II .
Procedure : • After the establishment of adequate diuresis , a number 14 or 16 French Foley catheter is aseptically inserted into the bladder .
• An intravenous infusion of Lactated Ringer ’ s ( Hartmann ’ s ) solution is started in each arm , one to maintain a site for injection of the GLOFIL ® - 125 , the other to serve as a site for serial withdrawal of blood .
A two - way stopcock connects the needle and intravenous tubing of each arm .
• The dose is equally divided into ( 1 ) an intravenous priming dose to be injected as is and ( 2 ) a sustaining dose to be diluted in 30 to 60 mL of isotonic sodium chloride , depending on how many collection periods are anticipated .
• The priming dose is slowly injected into one arm .
This is immediately followed by infusion of the sustaining solution through the same site , usually at the rate of 0 . 5 mL / min .
, by means of an automatic pump .
During this infusion , the Lactated Ringer ’ s solution in the same arm is discontinued , and 40 to 45 minutes are allowed for equilibration in order to reach a state of constant plasma concentration of radioactivity .
• After attaining equilibrium , consecutive 15 minute collection periods are started .
From the arm opposite the injection site , 5 mL of blood ( allowing duplicate plasma counting volumes ) is drawn six minutes prior to the midpoint of each collection period , placed in heparinized tubes , mixed , and centrifuged .
The blood samples may be obtained through the two - way stopcock after discarding the first 30 mL aspirated into the syringe .
This 30 mL contains the contents of the tubing , including infusion fluid , and must be cleared in order to obtain an undiluted blood sample .
If desired , this step may be eliminated and blood samples obtained by direct venipuncture .
• During each collection period , total urine must be accurately collected and the volume accurately measured .
Three such consecutive collection periods are sufficient for most clinical studies .
III .
Clearance Calculations : • Aliquots ( 1 mL each ) of plasma and urine from each collection period are counted in a standard gamma - ray scintillation well detector .
• All counts are corrected for background activity .
• Glomerular filtration rate is calculated by the formula C = UV / P , in which : C = glomerular filtration rate in mL / min U = urinary concentration of radioactivity in net counts / min / mL V = urinary flow rate in mL / min P = plasma concentration of radioactivity in net counts / min / mL • Average glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) is calculated from the rates for the individual collection periods .
GFR can be expressed in terms of body weight ( mL / min / kg ) or body surface area ( mL / min / m2 ) .
• Unilateral glomerular filtration rates can be determined by the same technique by utilizing ureteral catheterization .
Single intravenous injection Cohen ( 2 ) method : The method of Cohen , et al ( 2 ) requires little preparation , few and small blood samples , no bladder catheterization , and no constant intravenous infusion .
It is simple to perform , rapid , and utilizes equipment which is readily available in most modern laboratories .
I . Preparation : • Lugol ' s solution , 3 drops orally , three times a day , is administered for one or two days prior to the test .
No diet or water restriction is necessary .
• Oral water load is begun one hour before starting the test .
Start with 20 mL / kg and force any clear liquids ( unless contraindicated ) until the test is complete .
II .
Procedure : Record actual times for the collection of the blood and urine samples .
• Empty the bladder and label the urine Urine control .
• Inject 10 - 30 μCi GLOFIL ® - 125 intravenously ; wait 30 to 60 minutes .
• Collect the entire urine and label Urine discard .
• Draw 4 to 5 mL of blood into a heparinized syringe .
Label Plasma # 1 .
• After another 30 to 60 minutes , collect the entire urine and label Urine # 1 .
• Immediately draw another blood specimen .
Label Plasma # 2 .
• After final 30 to 60 minute wait , collect the urine .
Label Urine # 2 .
• Draw the last blood specimen immediately .
Label Plasma # 3 .
III .
Clearance Calculations : • Radioactivity of one mL aliquots of both urine and plasma are determined using a well - scintillation detector with a single channel pulse - height analyzer .
Sufficiently reproducible counts are usually obtained with time settings of 2 minutes for urine samples and 20 minutes for the plasma samples .
Calculations of the clearance rates are made by using the formula : ( 1 ) C = UV / P + 1 . 73 / SA where C = glomerular filtration rate in mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 U = urine radioactivity in counts / min / mL V = urine flow rate in mL / min P = mean plasma radioactivity in counts / min / mL SA = body surface area in m2 Radiation Dosimetry The estimated absorbed radiation doses to an average ( 70 kg ) patient from an intravenous dose of 100 μCi ( 3 . 7 megabecquerels ) of GLOFIL ® - 125 are shown in Table 4 .
Calculations assume that there is 1 % free iodide in the preparation and that the thyroid uptake of the iodine is 25 % .
