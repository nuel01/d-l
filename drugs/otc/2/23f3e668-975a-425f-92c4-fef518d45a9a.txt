1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE TAVALISSE is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment .
TAVALISSE is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia ( ITP ) who have had an insufficient response to a previous treatment .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Initiate TAVALISSE at 100 mg orally twice daily with or without food .
After 4 weeks , increase to 150 mg twice daily , if needed , to achieve platelet counts of at least 50 × 109 / L as necessary to reduce the risk of bleeding .
( 2 . 1 ) • Manage adverse reactions using dose reduction , interruption of treatment , or discontinuation .
( 2 . 3 ) • Discontinue TAVALISSE after 12 weeks of treatment if the platelet count does not increase to a level sufficient to avoid clinically important bleeding .
( 2 . 5 ) 2 . 1 Recommended Dosage Initiate TAVALISSE at a dose of 100 mg taken orally twice daily .
After a month , if platelet count has not increased to at least 50 × 109 / L , increase TAVALISSE dose to 150 mg twice daily .
Use the lowest dose of TAVALISSE to achieve and maintain a platelet count at least 50 × 109 / L as necessary to reduce the risk of bleeding .
TAVALISSE may be taken with or without food .
In the case of a missed dose of TAVALISSE , instruct patients to take their next dose at its regularly scheduled time .
2 . 2 Monitoring After obtaining baseline assessments : • Monitor CBCs , including platelet counts , monthly until a stable platelet count ( at least 50 × 109 / L ) is achieved .
Thereafter , continue to monitor CBCs , including neutrophils , regularly .
• Monitor liver function tests ( LFTs ) ( e . g . , ALT , AST , and bilirubin ) monthly .
• Monitor blood pressure every 2 weeks until establishment of a stable dose , then monthly thereafter .
2 . 3 Dose Modification for Adverse Reactions TAVALISSE dose modification is recommended based on individual safety and tolerability .
Management of some adverse reactions may require dose - interruption , reduction , or discontinuation .
A dose reduction schedule is provided in Table 1 , based on daily dose .
For example , if a patient is on the maximum dose at the time of an adverse reaction , the first dose reduction would be from 300 mg / day to 200 mg / day .
Table 1 : Dose Reduction ScheduleDaily Dose Administered as : AM PM 300 mg / day 150 mg 150 mg 200 mg / day 100 mg 100 mg 150 mg / day 150 mg [ 1 ] --- 100 mg / day [ 2 ] 100 mg null --- [ 1 ] Once daily TAVALISSE should be taken in the morning .
[ 2 ] If further dose reduction below 100 mg / day is required , discontinue TAVALISSE .
The recommended dose modifications for adverse reactions are provided in Table 2 .

If increased blood pressure persists despite appropriate therapy , TAVALISSE interruption , reduction or discontinuation may be necessary [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 2 Hepatotoxicity Elevated liver function tests ( LFTs ) , mainly ALT and AST , can occur with TAVALISSE .
In the placebo - controlled studies , laboratory testing showed maximum ALT / AST levels more than 3 × the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) in 9 % of patients receiving TAVALISSE [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
For most patients , transaminases recovered to baseline levels within 2 to 6 weeks of dose - modification .
Monitor liver function tests monthly during treatment .
If ALT or AST increase more than 3 × ULN , manage hepatotoxicity using TAVALISSE interruption , reduction , or discontinuation [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 3 Diarrhea Diarrhea occurred in 31 % of patients treated with TAVALISSE .
Severe diarrhea occurred in 1 % of patients treated with TAVALISSE .
Monitor patients for the development of diarrhea .
Manage diarrhea using supportive care measures , including dietary changes , hydration and / or antidiarrheal medication , early after the onset of symptoms .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
TAVALISSE was studied in two randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials that were identical in design .
The data described below reflect exposure to TAVALISSE in 102 patients with chronic ITP who had received one or more prior ITP treatment ( s ) .
Groups were stratified with respect to splenectomy and severity of thrombocytopenia .
Patients randomized to the TAVALISSE arm received 100 mg orally twice daily .
Based upon platelet count and tolerability , if a patient ' s platelet count did not increase to at least 50 × 109 / L , the TAVALISSE dose could be increased to 150 mg twice daily after one month .
In the placebo controlled studies , the median duration of TAVALISSE exposure in these studies was 86 days ( range 8 to 183 ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) for additional details for patients on TAVALISSE ] .
In the ITP double - blind studies , serious adverse drug reactions were febrile neutropenia , diarrhea , pneumonia , and hypertensive crisis , which each occurred in 1 % of patients receiving TAVALISSE .
In addition , severe adverse reactions observed in patients receiving TAVALISSE included dyspnea and hypertension ( both 2 % ) ; and neutropenia , arthralgia , chest pain , diarrhea , dizziness , nephrolithiasis , pain in extremity , toothache , syncope and hypoxia ( all 1 % ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Advise women of the risk to a fetus .
( 8 . 1 ) • Lactation : Advise women not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action , TAVALISSE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug - associated risk .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of fostamatinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes that were directly attributed to exposure in utero to the major fostamatinib metabolite ( R406 ) at maternal exposures ( AUC ) as low as 0 . 3 and 10 times the exposure in patients at the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) , respectively ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
An estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the chronic ITP population is 8 % and 4 - 11 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In a fertility and early embryonic development study in female rats , fostamatinib was administered orally for 15 days before mating to Day 7 of pregnancy , which caused a slight decrease in pregnancy rates and an increase in post - implantation loss were seen at maternal doses approximately 4 . 2 times the dose in patients at the MRHD .
In embryo - fetal development studies , pregnant animals were orally administered fostamatinib during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 and 50 mg / kg / day in rats and rabbits , respectively .
The adverse developmental outcomes included an increase in embryo - fetal mortality ( post - implantation loss ) , alterations to growth ( lower fetal weights ) , and structural abnormalities ( variations and malformations ) .
These effects occurred at maternal exposures ( AUCs ) of 3 , 763 ng . h / mL in rats and 111 , 105 ng . h / mL in rabbits that were approximately 0 . 3 and 10 times the human exposure at the MRHD in rats and rabbits , respectively .
In a peri and postnatal development study in rats , fostamatinib was orally administered at doses of 2 . 5 , 12 . 5 , and 25 mg / kg / day from gestation day 7 until lactation day 20 .
The dose of 25 mg / kg / day was associated with maternal toxicity , including decreased body weights , body weight gains , and food consumption .
At doses as low as 12 . 5 mg / kg / day fostamatinib caused increases in newborn mortality ( neonatal mortality ) , alterations in growth and / or development ( lower neonatal weights into post - weaning and structural abnormalities [ malformations ] ) .
Functional impairment ( delayed sexual maturation ) was observed at 25 mg / kg / day .
There was no evidence of neurobehavioral defects ( maze learning and shuttle box avoidance ) or immunological compromise ( influenza host resistance challenge ) in the F1 generation or latent untoward effects in the F2 generation .
The maternal doses were approximately 2 . 1 and 4 . 2 times the MHRD in patients .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of fostamatinib and / or its metabolites in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or on milk production .
In rodents , R406 ( the major active metabolite ) was detected in maternal milk in concentrations 5 - to 10 - fold higher than in maternal plasma .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from TAVALISSE , advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with TAVALISSE and for at least 1 month after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Based on animal studies , TAVALISSE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
For females of reproductive potential , verify pregnancy status prior to initiating TAVALISSE .
Contraception Females Based on animal studies , TAVALISSE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TAVALISSE and for at least 1 month after the last dose .
Infertility There are no data on the effect of TAVALISSE on human fertility .
Based on the finding of reduced pregnancy rates in animal studies , TAVALISSE may affect female fertility [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
TAVALISSE is not recommended for use in patients less than 18 years of age because adverse effects on actively growing bones were observed in nonclinical studies .
In subchronic , chronic , and carcinogenicity studies of TAVALISSE , chondrodystrophy of the femoral head was seen in rodents .
In a study in juvenile rabbits , growth plate dysplasia was observed in the proximal femur and femoro - tibial joint , and bone marrow cellularity was reduced in the femur and sternum .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 102 patients with ITP who received TAVALISSE , 28 ( 27 % ) were 65 years of age and older , while 11 ( 11 % ) were 75 years of age and older .
In patients 65 years of age and older , 6 ( 21 % ) patients experienced serious adverse events and 5 ( 18 % ) experienced adverse events leading to treatment withdrawal while in patients under 65 years of age , 7 ( 9 % ) and 5 ( 7 % ) experienced serious adverse events and adverse events leading to treatment withdrawal , respectively .
In patients 65 years of age and older who received TAVALISSE , 11 ( 39 % ) patients experienced hypertension versus 2 ( 18 % ) placebo compared to 17 ( 23 % ) in patients under 65 of age versus 4 ( 11 % ) placebo .
No overall differences in effectiveness were observed in these patients compared to younger patients .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no specific antidote for overdose with TAVALISSE , and the amount of R406 ( the pharmacologically active metabolite of fostamatinib ) cleared by dialysis is negligible .
In the event of an overdose , monitor patient closely for signs and symptoms of adverse reactions , and treat the reactions with supportive care [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION Fostamatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor .
TAVALISSE is formulated with the disodium hexahydrate salt of fostamatinib , a phosphate prodrug that converts to its pharmacologically active metabolite , R406 , in vivo .
The chemical name for fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate is disodium ( 6 - [ [ 5 - fluoro - 2 - ( 3 , 4 , 5 - trimethoxyanilino ) pyrimidin - 4 - yl ] amino ] - 2 , 2 - dimethyl - 3 - oxo - pyrido [ 3 , 2 - b ] [ 1 , 4 ] oxazin - 4 - yl ) methyl phosphate hexahydrate .
The molecular formula is C23H24FN6Na2O9P ∙ 6H2O , and the molecular weight is 732 . 52 .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Fostamatinib disodium is a white to off - white powder that is practically insoluble in pH 1 . 2 aqueous buffer , slightly soluble in water , and soluble in methanol .
Each TAVALISSE oral tablet contains 100 mg or 150 mg fostamatinib , equivalent to 126 . 2 mg or 189 . 3 mg fostamatinib disodium hexahydrate , respectively .
The inactive ingredients in the tablet core are mannitol , sodium bicarbonate , sodium starch glycolate , povidone , and magnesium stearate .
The inactive ingredients in the film coating are polyvinyl alcohol , titanium dioxide , polyethylene glycol 3350 , talc , iron oxide yellow , and iron oxide red .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Fostamatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with demonstrated activity against spleen tyrosine kinase ( SYK ) .
The major metabolite of fostamatinib , R406 , inhibits signal transduction of Fc - activating receptors and B - cell receptor .
The fostamatinib metabolite R406 reduces antibody - mediated destruction of platelets .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Mean treatment - related increases of 2 . 93 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and 3 . 53 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure over placebo were observed following TAVALISSE doses of 100 mg twice daily for 28 days .
About 31 % of patients in the TAVALISSE group experienced blood pressures ≥ 140 / 90 mmHg compared to 15 % of patients in the placebo group .
Blood pressure returned to baseline within 1 week following TAVALISSE discontinuation in 58 % ( 11 of 19 ) of patients in the TAVALISSE group who had blood pressures ≥ 140 / 90 mmHg .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At 2 times the maximum recommended dose , TAVALISSE did not prolong the QT interval to a clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics TAVALISSE is a prodrug that is converted in the gut to the major active metabolite , R406 .
Mean ( ± standard deviation [ SD ] ) exposure estimates of R406 are 550 ( ± 270 ) ng / mL for Cmax and 7080 ( ± 2670 ) ng ∙ h / mL for AUC .
R406 exposure is approximately dose proportional up to 200 mg twice daily ( 1 . 3 times the 150 mg dosage ) .
R406 accumulates approximately 2 - to 3 - fold upon twice daily dosing at 100 – 160 mg ( 0 . 67 to 1 . 06 times the 150 mg dosage ) .
Absorption After oral administration of TAVALISSE , the absolute bioavailability of R406 was 55 % .
The median tmax of R406 is approximately 1 . 5 hours ( range : 1 to 4 hours ) .
Negligible levels of fostamatinib were found in plasma .
Effect of Food Administration of TAVALISSE with a high - calorie , high - fat meal ( deriving approximately 150 , 250 , and 500 – 600 calories from protein , carbohydrate , and fat , respectively ) increased R406 AUC by 23 % and Cmax by 15 % [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Distribution In in vitro studies , the R406 is 98 . 3 % protein bound in human plasma .
The red blood cell to plasma concentration ratio is approximately 2 . 6 .
The mean ( ± SD ) volume of distribution at steady - state of R406 is 256 ( ± 92 ) L . Elimination The mean ( ± SD ) terminal half - life of R406 is approximately 15 ( ± 4 . 3 ) hours .
Metabolism TAVALISSE is metabolized in the gut by alkaline phosphatase to the major active metabolite , R406 .
R406 is extensively metabolized , primarily through pathways of CYP450 - mediated oxidation ( by CYP3A4 ) and glucuronidation ( by UDP glucuronosyltransferase [ UGT ] 1A9 ) .
R406 is the predominant moiety in the systemic circulation , and there was minimal exposure to any R406 metabolites .
Excretion Following an oral dose of TAVALISSE , approximately 80 % of the R406 metabolite is excreted in feces with approximately 20 % excreted in the urine .
The major component excreted in urine was R406 N - glucuronide .
The major components excreted in feces were R406 , O - desmethyl R406 and a metabolite produced by gut bacteria from the O - desmethyl metabolite of R406 .
Specific Populations Population pharmacokinetics analyses indicate TAVALISSE is not altered based on age , sex , race / ethnicity .
In addition , the pharmacokinetics of TAVALISSE is not altered in patients with renal impairment ( creatinine clearance [ CLcr ] ≥ 30 to < 50 mL / min , estimated by Cockcroft Gault equation and end stage renal disease requiring dialysis ) , or hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A , B and C ) .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Pharmacology Studies No significant interactions were seen with concomitant use of TAVALISSE with the following drugs : methotrexate ( OAT1 / 3 transporters ) , midazolam ( CYP3A4 substrate ) , microgynon ( ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel ) , warfarin , pioglitazone ( CYP2C8 substrate ) and ranitidine ( H2 - antagonist that increases gastric pH ) .
Effect of Other Drugs on TAVALISSE Strong CYP3A4 inhibitor : Concomitant use of ketoconazole ( 200 mg twice daily for 3 . 5 days ) with a single dose of 80 mg TAVALISSE ( 0 . 53 times the 150 mg dosage ) increased R406 AUC by 102 % and Cmax by 37 % .
Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitor : Concomitant use of verapamil ( 80 mg three times daily for 4 days ) with a single dose of 150 mg TAVALISSE increased R406 AUC by 39 % and Cmax by 6 % .
CYP3A4 inducer : Concomitant use of rifampicin ( 600 mg once daily for 8 days ) with a single dose of 150 mg TAVALISSE decreased R406 AUC by 75 % and Cmax by 59 % .
Effect of TAVALISSE on Other Drugs CYP3A4 substrate : Concomitant use of simvastatin ( single dose 40 mg ) with 100 mg twice daily TAVALISSE increased simvastatin AUC by 64 % and Cmax by 113 % and simvastatin acid AUC by 64 % and Cmax by 83 % .
BCRP substrate : Concomitant use of rosuvastatin ( single dose 20 mg ) with 100 mg twice daily TAVALISSE increased rosuvastatin AUC by 95 % and Cmax by 88 % .
P - gp substrate : Concomitant use of digoxin ( 0 . 25 mg once daily ) with 100 mg twice daily TAVALISSE increased digoxin AUC by 37 % and Cmax by 70 % .
In Vitro Studies TAVALISSE is an inhibitor of the human P - gp efflux transporter in vitro .
CYP3A4 and UGT1A9 are involved in the metabolism of R406 .
R406 is a substrate of P - gp but not of other major transporters ( OAT1 / 3 , OCT2 , OATP1B1 / 3 , MRP2 , and BCRP ) .
R406 can inhibit CYP3A4 and BCRP , and can induce CYP2C8 activity .
R406 is an inhibitor of UGT1A1 .
Inhibition of UGT1A1 may result in increased unconjugated bilirubin in the absence of other LFT abnormalities .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Fostamatinib was not carcinogenic in a 2 - year study in mice when administered daily by oral gavage at doses up to 500 / 250 mg / kg / day , and was not carcinogenic in rats when administered by oral gavage at 45 mg / kg / day .
Fostamatinib and its major active metabolite ( R406 ) were not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay or clastogenic in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay or an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay .
In a fertility study with oral fostamatinib , all mating ( e . g . , time to mating , breeding proficiency ) , sperm assessments ( e . g . , number and motility ) , and organ weight ( e . g . , paired testis weight ) parameters in male rats were unaffected by dosages as high as 40 mg / kg / day , which is 6 . 7 times the MRHD .
All mating and fertility parameters in female rats were unaffected by dosages as high as 11 mg / kg / day ( which is 1 . 8 times the MRHD ) , but a slight decrease in pregnancy rates and an increase in post - implantation loss were seen at 25 mg / kg / day , which is 4 . 2 times the MRHD .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES TAVALISSE was studied in two placebo - controlled efficacy and safety studies ( referred to as FIT - 1 [ NCT02076399 ] and FIT - 2 [ NCT02076412 ] ) , and in an open - label extension study referred to as FIT - 3 ( NCT 02077192 ) .
Randomized , Placebo - Controlled Studies A total of 150 patients with persistent or chronic ITP , who had an insufficient response to previous treatment ( which included corticosteroids , immunoglobulins , splenectomy , and / or a thrombopoietin receptor agonists ) were enrolled in two identical , double - blind , placebo - controlled studies that were conducted in different countries .
For each study , patients were randomized 2 : 1 to TAVALISSE or placebo for 24 weeks ; randomization was stratified with respect to prior splenectomy and severity of thrombocytopenia .
Stable concurrent ITP therapy ( glucocorticoids [ < 20 mg prednisone equivalent per day ] , azathioprine , or danazol ) was allowed , and rescue therapy was permitted , if needed .
All patients initially received study drug at 100 mg twice daily ( or matching placebo ) .
Based on platelet count and tolerability , dose escalation to 150 mg twice daily ( or matching placebo ) was undertaken in 88 % of patients at Week 4 or later .
Patients who did not respond to treatment after 12 weeks , as well as patients who completed the 24 - week double blind study , were eligible to enroll in open - label extension study ( FIT - 3 ) .
Patients enrolled in the placebo - controlled studies had a median age of 54 years ( range : 20 to 88 ) , and the majority were female ( 61 % ) and were White ( 93 % ) .
Prior ITP treatments were varied , with the most common including corticosteroids ( 94 % ) , immunoglobulins ( 53 % ) , and thrombopoietin receptor agonists ( TPO - RA ) ( 48 % ) .
Most patients had chronic ITP ( 93 % ) , with a median time since ITP diagnosis of 8 . 45 years , and 35 % had undergone splenectomy .
At baseline , the median platelet count was 16 × 109 / L ( with almost half [ 45 ] % ) less than 15 × 109 / L ) and 47 % were on stable ITP therapy .
In Study FIT - 1 , 76 patients were randomized ; 51 to the TAVALISSE group and 25 to the placebo group .
In Study FIT - 2 , 74 patients were randomized ; 50 to the TAVALISSE group and 24 to the placebo group .
The efficacy of TAVALISSE was based on stable platelet response ( at least 50 × 109 / L on at least 4 of the 6 visits between Weeks 14 to 24 ) .
Study outcomes for FIT - 1 and FIT - 2 are shown in Table 5 .

In the FIT - 1 and FIT - 2 studies a total of 47 patients in the TAVALISSE arm had received a prior TPO - RA treatment ; among these patients , 8 patients ( 17 % ) achieved a stable response to TAVALISSE .
All 8 patients had previously discontinued TPO - RA due to loss of effect .
Rescue medication was required by 30 % and 45 % of patients receiving TAVALISSE or placebo , respectively .
During the placebo - controlled studies , the incidence of bleeding occurred in 29 % and 37 % of patients in the TAVALISSE and placebo arms , respectively .
Moderate , severe and serious bleeding events are described in Table 6 .
All severe events led to hospitalizations .

Patients from FIT - 1 and FIT - 2 who completed 24 weeks of treatment , or who did not respond to treatment any time after 12 weeks , were eligible to enroll in this study .
Patients remained blinded to their treatment assignment from the previous study ( TAVALISSE or placebo ) , so their starting dose in this study was based on their final platelet count .
Patients designated as responders ( defined as achievement of platelet count of at least 50 × 109 / L ) at the time of roll over continued in the extension study at their current trial dose and regimen .
Patients who entered the extension study as non - responders ( defined as platelet count less than 50 × 109 / L ) received TAVALISSE 100 mg twice daily regardless of their dose and regimen in the prior study .
For the FIT - 3 trial , 123 patients were enrolled , 44 patients previously randomized to placebo and 79 patients previously randomized to TAVALISSE .
Stable response in this study was prospectively defined as no 2 visits , at least 4 weeks apart , with a platelet count less than 50 × 109 / L , without an intervening visit with a platelet count of at least 50 × 109 / L ( unrelated to rescue therapy ) , within a period of 12 weeks following initial achievement of the target platelet count .
Sixty - one of the 123 subjects ( 50 % ) have discontinued from the study early .
In a prospectively defined analysis , the 44 subjects treated with placebo in the prior study were evaluated for stable response for TAVALISSE .
Ten of these subjects ( 23 % ) ( including a single subject who was classified as a placebo responder in the prior study ) met the criteria for stable response .
Among the subjects who achieved stable response in FIT - 1 , FIT - 2 and FIT - 3 trials , 18 subjects maintained the platelet count of at least 50 × 109 / L for 12 months or longer .
