( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylactic - type reactions , some of which have been life - threatening and fatal , have been reported in patients receiving Injectafer .
Patients may present with shock , clinically significant hypotension , loss of consciousness , and / or collapse .
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity during and after Injectafer administration for at least 30 minutes and until clinically stable following completion of the infusion .
Only administer Injectafer when personnel and therapies are immediately available for the treatment of serious hypersensitivity reactions .
[ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 , 6 . 2 ) ] .
In clinical trials , serious anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions were reported in 0 . 1 % ( 2 / 1 , 775 ) of subjects receiving Injectafer .
Other serious or severe adverse reactions potentially associated with hypersensitivity which included , but not limited to , pruritus , rash , urticaria , wheezing , or hypotension were reported in 1 . 5 % ( 26 / 1 , 775 ) of these subjects .
5 . 2 Symptomatic Hypophosphatemia Symptomatic hypophosphatemia requiring clinical intervention has been reported in patients at risk of low serum phosphate in the postmarketing setting .
These cases have occurred mostly after repeated exposure to Injectafer in patients with no reported history of renal impairment .
Possible risk factors for hypophosphatemia include a history of gastrointestinal disorders associated with malabsorption of fat - soluble vitamins or phosphate , concurrent or prior use of medications that affect proximal renal tubular function , hyperparathyroidism , vitamin D deficiency and malnutrition .
In most cases , hypophosphatemia resolved within three months .
Monitor serum phosphate levels in patients at risk for low serum phosphate who require a repeat course of treatment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 3 Hypertension In clinical studies , hypertension was reported in 4 % ( 67 / 1 , 775 ) of subjects in clinical trials 1 and 2 .
Transient elevations in systolic blood pressure , sometimes occurring with facial flushing , dizziness , or nausea were observed in 6 % ( 106 / 1 , 775 ) of subjects in these two clinical trials .
These elevations generally occurred immediately after dosing and resolved within 30 minutes .
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypertension following each Injectafer administration [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
5 . 4 Laboratory Test Alterations In the 24 hours following administration of Injectafer , laboratory assays may overestimate serum iron and transferrin bound iron by also measuring the iron in Injectafer .

6 . 2 Post - marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Injectafer .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
The following adverse reactions have been reported from the post - marketing spontaneous reports with Injectafer : urticaria , dyspnea , pruritus , tachycardia , erythema , pyrexia , chest discomfort , chills , angioedema , back pain , arthralgia , and syncope .
One case of hypophosphatemic osteomalacia was reported in a subject who received 500 mg of Injectafer every 2 weeks for a total of 16 weeks .
Partial recovery followed discontinuation of Injectafer .
• Cardiac disorders : Tachycardia • General disorders and administration site conditions : Chest discomfort , chills , pyrexia • Metabolism and nutrition disorders : Hypophosphatemia • Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : Arthralgia , back pain , hypophosphatemic osteomalacia ( rarely reported event ) • Nervous system disorders : Syncope • Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders : Dyspnea • Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Angioedema , erythema , pruritus , urticaria • Pregnancy : Fetal bradycardia 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : Risk of hypersensitivity reactions which may have serious consequences for the fetus .
( 8 . 1 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Parenteral iron administration may be associated with hypersensitivity reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] , which may have serious consequences , such as fetal bradycardia ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Published studies and available data from postmarketing reports with intravenous Injectafer are insufficient to assess the risk of major birth defects and miscarriage .
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated IDA in pregnancy as well as risks to the fetus associated with maternal severe hypersensitivity reactions ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of ferric carboxymaltose to rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including fetal malformations and increased implantation loss at maternally toxic doses of approximately 12 % to 23 % of the human weekly dose of 750 mg ( based on body surface area ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically - recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk Untreated IDA in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes such as post - partum anemia .
Adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with IDA include increased risk for preterm delivery and low birth weight .
Fetal / Neonatal adverse reactions Severe adverse reactions including circulatory failure ( severe hypotension , shock including in the context of anaphylactic reaction ) may occur in pregnant women with parenteral iron products ( such as Injectafer ) which may cause fetal bradycardia , especially during the second and third trimester .
Data Human Data Published data from randomized controlled studies , prospective observational studies and retrospective studies on the use of ferric carboxymaltose in pregnant women have not reported an association with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose and major birth defects and miscarriage .
However , these studies cannot establish or exclude the absence of any drug - related risk during pregnancy .
Animal Data Administration of ferric carboxymaltose to rats as a one - hour intravenous infusion up to 30 mg / kg / day iron on gestation days 6 to 17 did not result in adverse embryonic or fetal findings .
This daily dose in rats is approximately 40 % of the human weekly dose of 750 mg based on body surface area .
In rabbits , ferric carboxymaltose was administered as a one - hour infusion on gestation days 6 to 19 at iron doses of 4 . 5 , 9 , 13 . 5 , and 18 mg / kg / day .
Malformations were seen starting at the daily dose of 9 mg / kg ( 23 % of the human weekly dose of 750 mg ) .
Spontaneous abortions occurred starting at the daily iron dose of 4 . 5 mg / kg ( 12 % of the human weekly dose of 750 mg based on body surface area ) .
Pre - implantation loss was at the highest dose .
Adverse embryonic or fetal effects were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity .
A pre - and post - natal development study was conducted in rats at intravenous doses up to 18 mg / kg / day of iron ( approximately 23 % of the weekly human dose of 750 mg based on body surface area ) .
There were no adverse effects on survival of offspring , their behavior , sexual maturation or reproductive parameters .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary The available published data on the use of ferric carboxymaltose in lactating women demonstrate that iron is present in breast milk .
Among the breastfed infants , adverse reactions included constipation and diarrhea but none of the adverse reactions reported were considered related to ferric carboxymaltose exposure through breastmilk .
There is no information on the effects of ferric carboxymaltose on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for Injectafer in addition to any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Injectafer for IDA in pediatric patients aged 1 year and older who have normal kidney function and have either intolerance to oral iron or have had unsatisfactory response to oral iron have been established .
Use of Injectafer for this indication in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies of Injectafer in adults with additional pharmacodynamic and safety data in pediatric patients aged 1 year and older [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Safety and effectiveness of Injectafer have not been established in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age with IDA .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 1 , 775 subjects in clinical studies of Injectafer , 50 % were 65 years and over , while 25 % were 75 years and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
10 OVERDOSAGE Excessive dosages of Injectafer may lead to accumulation of iron in storage sites potentially leading to hemosiderosis .
A patient who received Injectafer 18 , 000 mg over 6 months developed hemosiderosis with multiple joint disorder , walking disability , and asthenia .
Hypophosphatemic osteomalacia was reported in a patient who received Injectafer 4 , 000 mg over 4 months .
Partial recovery followed discontinuation of Injectafer .
11 DESCRIPTION Ferric carboxymaltose , an iron replacement product , is an iron carbohydrate complex with the chemical name of polynuclear iron ( III ) - hydroxide 4 ( R ) - ( poly - ( 1 → 4 ) - O - α - D - glucopyranosyl ) - oxy - 2 ( R ) , 3 ( R ) , 5 ( R ) , 6 - tetrahydroxy - hexanoate .
It has a relative molecular weight of approximately 150 , 000 Da corresponding to the following empirical formula : [ FeOx ( OH ) y ( H2O ) z ] n [ { ( C6H10O5 ) m ( C6H12O7 ) } l ] k , where n ≈ 103 , m ≈ 8 , l ≈ 11 , and k ≈ 4 ( l represents the mean branching degree of the ligand ) .
The chemical structure is presented below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Injectafer ( ferric carboxymaltose injection ) is a dark brown , sterile , aqueous , isotonic colloidal solution for intravenous injection .
Each mL contains 50 mg iron as ferric carboxymaltose in water for injection .
Injectafer is available in 2 mL , 15 mL and 20 mL single - dose vials .
Sodium hydroxide and / or hydrochloric acid may have been added to adjust the pH to 5 . 0 - 7 . 0 .
Vial closure is not made with natural rubber latex .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Ferric carboxymaltose is a colloidal iron ( III ) hydroxide in complex with carboxymaltose , a carbohydrate polymer that releases iron .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Using positron emission tomography ( PET ) it was demonstrated that red cell uptake of 59 Fe and 52 Fe from Injectafer ranged from 61 % to 99 % .
In patients with iron deficiency , red cell uptake of radio - labeled iron ranged from 91 % to 99 % at 24 days after Injectafer dose .
In patients with renal anemia , red cell uptake of radio - labeled iron ranged from 61 % to 84 % at 24 days after Injectafer dose .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics After administration of a single dose of Injectafer of 100 to 1 , 000 mg of iron in iron deficient adult patients , maximum iron concentration of 37 µg / mL to 333 µg / mL were obtained respectively after 15 minutes to 1 . 21 hours post dose .
The volume of distribution was estimated to be 3 L .
The iron injected or infused was rapidly cleared from the plasma , the terminal half - life ranged from 7 to 12 hours .
Renal elimination of iron was negligible .
After administration of a single dose of Injectafer 15 mg / kg in pediatric patients 1 - 17 years of age , the maximum concentrations ranged between 124 and 418 . 1 μg / mL and the median time to maximum concentration was 7 minutes .
The elimination half - life of Injectafer in pediatric patients was approximately 9 . 7 hours .
The total median 72 - hour exposure ( AUC0 - 72 h ) after a single dose of Injectafer 15 mg / kg in pediatric patients was 4529 . 7 μg ∙ h / mL while the median exposure after a single dose of 1000 mg in adults was 5875 . 3 μg ∙ h / mL .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with ferric carboxymaltose .
Ferric carboxymaltose was not genotoxic in the following genetic toxicology studies : in vitro microbial mutagenesis ( Ames ) assay , in vitro chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes , in vitro mammalian cell mutation assay in mouse lymphoma L5178Y / TK + / - cells , in vivo mouse micronucleus test at single intravenous doses up to 500 mg / kg .
In a combined male and female fertility study , ferric carboxymaltose was administered intravenously over one hour to male and female rats at iron doses of up to 30 mg / kg .
Animals were dosed 3 times per week ( on Days 0 , 3 , and 7 ) .
There was no effect on mating function , fertility or early embryonic development .
Based on body surface area , the dose of 30 mg / kg in animals is approximately 40 % of the human dose of 750 mg .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of Injectafer for treatment of IDA were evaluated in two randomized , open - label , controlled clinical trials ( Trial 1 and Trial 2 ) .
In these two trials , Injectafer was administered at a dose of 15 mg / kg body weight up to a maximum single dose of 750 mg of iron on two occasions separated by at least 7 days up to a cumulative dose of 1 , 500 mg of iron .
