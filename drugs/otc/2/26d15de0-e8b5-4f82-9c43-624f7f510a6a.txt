4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None None 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Severe , potentially life threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported .
This includes cases of Stevens - Johnson syndrome , hypersensitivity reaction , toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme .
Immediately discontinue treatment if severe hypersensitivity , severe rash or rash with systemic symptoms or liver transaminase elevations develops and monitor clinical status , including liver transaminases closely .
( 5 . 1 ) 5 . 1 Severe Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe , potentially life - threatening , and fatal skin reactions have been reported .
These include cases of Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis and erythema multiforme .
Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported and were characterized by rash , constitutional findings , and sometimes organ dysfunction , including hepatic failure .
In Phase 3 clinical trials , Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported in 1 . 3 % of subjects receiving INTELENCE ® compared to 0 . 2 % of placebo subjects .
A total of 2 . 2 % of HIV - 1 - infected subjects receiving INTELENCE ® discontinued from Phase 3 trials due to rash [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Rash occurred most commonly during the first 6 weeks of therapy .
Discontinue INTELENCE ® immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop ( including , but not limited to , severe rash or rash accompanied by fever , general malaise , fatigue , muscle or joint aches , blisters , oral lesions , conjunctivitis , facial edema , hepatitis , eosinophilia , angioedema ) .
Clinical status including liver transaminases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated .
Delay in stopping INTELENCE ® treatment after the onset of severe rash may result in a life - threatening reaction .
5 . 2 Fat Redistribution Redistribution / accumulation of body fat , including central obesity , dorsocervical fat enlargement ( buffalo hump ) , peripheral wasting , facial wasting , breast enlargement , and " cushingoid appearance " have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy .
The mechanism and long - term consequences of these events are currently unknown .
A causal relationship has not been established .
5 . 3 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy , including INTELENCE ® .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia ( PCP ) or tuberculosis ) , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
Autoimmune disorders ( such as Graves ' disease , polymyositis , and Guillain - Barré syndrome ) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution ; however , the time to onset is more variable , and can occur many months after initiation of treatment .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described in greater detail in other sections : • Severe skin and hypersensitivity reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The most common adverse drug reactions of moderate to severe intensity ( at least 2 % ) which occurred at a higher rate than placebo in adults are rash and peripheral neuropathy .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience : Adults Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety assessment is based on all data from 1203 subjects in the Phase 3 placebo - controlled trials , TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 , conducted in antiretroviral treatment - experienced HIV - 1 - infected adult subjects , 599 of whom received INTELENCE ® ( 200 mg twice daily ) .
In these pooled trials , the median exposure for subjects in the INTELENCE ® arm and placebo arm was 52 . 3 and 51 . 0 weeks , respectively .
Discontinuations due to adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) were 5 . 2 % in the INTELENCE ® arm and 2 . 6 % in the placebo arm .
The most frequently reported ADR at least Grade 2 in severity was rash ( 10 . 0 % ) .
Stevens - Johnson syndrome , drug hypersensitivity reaction and erythema multiforme were reported in less than 0 . 1 % of subjects during clinical development with INTELENCE ® [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
A total of 2 . 2 % of HIV - 1 - infected subjects in Phase 3 trials receiving INTELENCE ® discontinued due to rash .
In general , in clinical trials , rash was mild to moderate , occurred primarily in the second week of therapy , and was infrequent after Week 4 .
Rash generally resolved within 1 to 2 weeks on continued therapy .
The incidence of rash was higher in women compared to men in the INTELENCE ® arm in the Phase 3 trials .
Patients with a history of NNRTI - related rash did not appear to be at increased risk for the development of INTELENCE ® - related rash compared to patients without a history of NNRTI - related rash .
Common Adverse Reactions Clinical ADRs of moderate intensity or greater ( greater than or equal to Grade 2 ) and reported in at least 2 % of subjects treated with INTELENCE ® and occurring at a higher rate compared to placebo ( excess of 1 % ) are presented in Table 1 .

AST and ALT abnormalities occurred more frequently in hepatitis B and / or hepatitis C virus co - infected subjects for both treatment groups .
Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening from baseline of AST , ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 27 . 8 % , 25 . 0 % and 7 . 1 % respectively , of INTELENCE ® - treated co - infected subjects as compared to 6 . 7 % , 7 . 5 % and 1 . 8 % of non - co - infected INTELENCE ® - treated subjects .
In general , adverse events reported by INTELENCE ® - treated subjects with hepatitis B and / or hepatitis C virus co - infection were similar to INTELENCE ® - treated subjects without hepatitis B and / or hepatitis C virus co - infection .
6 . 2 Clinical Trials Experience : Pediatric Subjects ( 6 years to less than 18 years of age ) The safety assessment in children and adolescents is based on the Week 24 analysis of the single - arm , Phase 2 trial TMC125 - C213 in which 101 antiretroviral treatment - experienced HIV - 1 infected subjects 6 years to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 16 kg received INTELENCE in combination with other antiretroviral agents [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The frequency , type and severity of adverse drug reactions in pediatric subjects were comparable to those observed in adult subjects , except for rash which was observed more frequently in pediatric subjects .
The most common adverse drug reactions in at least 2 % of pediatric subjects were rash and diarrhea .
Rash ( greater than or equal to Grade 2 ) occurred in 15 % of pediatric subjects .
In the majority of cases , rash was mild to moderate , of macular / papular type , and occurred in the second week of therapy .
Rash was self - limiting and generally resolved within 1 week on continued therapy .
The discontinuation rate for rash was 4 % .
Rash including serious ( Grade 3 or 4 ) events and discontinuations were more frequently observed in female subjects compared to male subjects .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following events have been identified during postmarketing use of INTELENCE ® .
Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Immune System Disorders : Severe hypersensitivity reactions including cases of hepatic failure have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : rhabdomyolysis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Fatal cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Etravirine is a substrate of CYP3A , CYP2C9 , and CYP2C19 .
Therefore , co - administration of INTELENCE ® with drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A , CYP2C9 , and CYP2C19 may alter the therapeutic effect or adverse reaction profile of INTELENCE ® ( see Table 3 ) .
[ See also Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) . ]
Etravirine is an inducer of CYP3A and inhibitor of CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 and P - glycoprotein .
Therefore , co - administration of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A , CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 or are transported by P - glycoprotein with INTELENCE ® may alter the therapeutic effect or adverse reaction profile of the co - administered drug ( s ) ( see Table 3 ) .
[ See also Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) . ]
Table 3 shows the established and other potentially significant drug interactions based on which , alterations in dose or regimen of INTELENCE ® and / or co - administered drug may be recommended .
Drugs that are not recommended for co - administration with INTELENCE ® are also included in Table 3 .
Table 3 : Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions : Alterations in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studies or Predicted Interaction [ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] Concomitant Drug Class : Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Etravirine or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment ↑ = increase , ↓ = decrease , ↔ = no change HIV - Antiviral Agents : Non - Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors ( NNRTIs ) efavirenz [ 1 ] nevirapine null ↓ etravirine Combining two NNRTIs has not been shown to be beneficial .
Concomitant use of INTELENCE ® with efavirenz or nevirapine may cause a significant decrease in the plasma concentrations of etravirine and loss of therapeutic effect of INTELENCE ® .
INTELENCE ® and other NNRTIs should not be co - administered .
delavirdine ↑ etravirine Combining two NNRTIs has not been shown to be beneficial .
INTELENCE ® and delavirdine should not be co - administered .
rilpivirine ↓ rilpivirine ↔ etravirine Combining two NNRTIs has not been shown to be beneficial .
INTELENCE ® and rilpivirine should not be coadministered .
HIV - Antiviral Agents : Protease Inhibitors ( PIs ) atazanavir null ( without ritonavir ) ↓ atazanavir Concomitant use of INTELENCE ® with atazanavir without low - dose ritonavir may cause a significant alteration in the plasma concentration of atazanavir .
INTELENCE ® should not be co - administered with atazanavir without low - dose ritonavir .
atazanavir / ritonavir null ↓ atazanavir ↑ etravirine Concomitant use of INTELENCE ® with atazanavir / ritonavir may cause a significant decrease in atazanavir Cmin and loss of therapeutic effect of atazanavir .
In addition , the mean systemic exposure ( AUC ) of etravirine after co - administration of INTELENCE ® with atazanavir / ritonavir is anticipated to be higher than the mean systemic exposure of etravirine observed in the Phase 3 trials after co - administration of INTELENCE ® and darunavir / ritonavir ( as part of the background regimen ) .
INTELENCE ® and atazanavir / ritonavir should not be co - administered .
darunavir / ritonavir null ↓ etravirine The mean systemic exposure ( AUC ) of etravirine was reduced when INTELENCE ® was co - administered with darunavir / ritonavir .
Because all subjects in the Phase 3 trials received darunavir / ritonavir as part of the background regimen and etravirine exposures from these trials were determined to be safe and effective , INTELENCE ® and darunavir / ritonavir can be co - administered without dose adjustments .
fosamprenavir ( without ritonavir ) ↑ amprenavir Concomitant use of INTELENCE ® with fosamprenavir without low - dose ritonavir may cause a significant alteration in the plasma concentration of amprenavir .
INTELENCE ® should not be co - administered with fosamprenavir without low - dose ritonavir .
fosamprenavir / ritonavir null ↑ amprenavir Due to a significant increase in the systemic exposure of amprenavir , the appropriate doses of the combination of INTELENCE ® and fosamprenavir / ritonavir have not been established .
INTELENCE ® and fosamprenavir / ritonavir should not be co - administered .
indinavir null ( without ritonavir ) ↓ indinavir Concomitant use of INTELENCE ® with indinavir without low - dose ritonavir may cause a significant alteration in the plasma concentration of indinavir .
INTELENCE ® should not be co - administered with indinavir without low - dose ritonavir .
lopinavir / ritonavir null ↓ etravirine The mean systemic exposure ( AUC ) of etravirine was reduced after co - administration of INTELENCE ® with lopinavir / ritonavir ( tablet ) .
Because the reduction in the mean systemic exposures of etravirine in the presence of lopinavir / ritonavir is similar to the reduction in mean systemic exposures of etravirine in the presence of darunavir / ritonavir , INTELENCE ® and lopinavir / ritonavir can be co - administered without dose adjustments .
nelfinavir ( without ritonavir ) ↑ nelfinavir Concomitant use of INTELENCE ® with nelfinavir without low - dose ritonavir may cause a significant alteration in the plasma concentration of nelfinavir .
INTELENCE ® should not be co - administered with nelfinavir without low - dose ritonavir .
ritonavir null ↓ etravirine Concomitant use of INTELENCE ® with ritonavir 600 mg twice daily may cause a significant decrease in the plasma concentration of etravirine and loss of therapeutic effect of INTELENCE ® .
INTELENCE ® and ritonavir 600 mg twice daily should not be co - administered .
saquinavir / ritonavir null ↓ etravirine The mean systemic exposure ( AUC ) of etravirine was reduced when INTELENCE ® was co - administered with saquinavir / ritonavir .
Because the reduction in the mean systemic exposures of etravirine in the presence of saquinavir / ritonavir is similar to the reduction in mean systemic exposures of etravirine in the presence of darunavir / ritonavir , INTELENCE ® and saquinavir / ritonavir can be co - administered without dose adjustments .
tipranavir / ritonavir null ↓ etravirine Concomitant use of INTELENCE ® with tipranavir / ritonavir may cause a significant decrease in the plasma concentrations of etravirine and loss of therapeutic effect of INTELENCE ® .
INTELENCE ® and tipranavir / ritonavir should not be co - administered .
CCR5 Antagonists maraviroc null ↔ etravirine ↓ maraviroc When INTELENCE ® is co - administered with maraviroc in the absence of a potent CYP3A inhibitor ( e . g . , ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor ) , the recommended dose of maraviroc is 600 mg twice daily .
No dose adjustment of INTELENCE ® is needed .
maraviroc / darunavir / ritonavir null ↔ etravirine ↑ maraviroc When INTELENCE ® is co - administered with maraviroc in the presence of a potent CYP3A inhibitor ( e . g . , ritonavir boosted protease inhibitor ) , the recommended dose of maraviroc is 150 mg twice daily .
No dose adjustment of INTELENCE ® is needed .
Other Agents Antiarrhythmics : digoxin null ↔ etravirine ↑ digoxin For patients who are initiating a combination of INTELENCE ® and digoxin , the lowest dose of digoxin should initially be prescribed .
For patients on a stable digoxin regimen and initiating INTELENCE ® , no dose adjustment of either INTELENCE ® or digoxin is needed .
The serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored and used for titration of the digoxin dose to obtain the desired clinical effect .
amiodarone , bepridil , disopyramide , flecainide , lidocaine ( systemic ) , mexiletine , propafenone , quinidine ↓ antiarrhythmics Concentrations of these antiarrhythmics may be decreased when co - administered with INTELENCE ® .
INTELENCE ® and antiarrhythmics should be co - administered with caution .
Drug concentration monitoring is recommended , if available .
Anticoagulants : warfarin ↑ anticoagulants Warfarin concentrations may be increased when co - administered with INTELENCE ® .
The international normalized ratio ( INR ) should be monitored when warfarin is combined with INTELENCE ® .
Anticonvulsants : carbamazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin ↓ etravirine Carbamazepine , phenobarbital and phenytoin are inducers of CYP450 enzymes .
INTELENCE ® should not be used in combination with carbamazepine , phenobarbital , or phenytoin as co - administration may cause significant decreases in etravirine plasma concentrations and loss of therapeutic effect of INTELENCE ® .
Antifungals : fluconazole null , voriconazole null ↑ etravirine ↔ fluconazole ↑ voriconazole Co - administration of etravirine and fluconazole significantly increased etravirine exposures .
The amount of safety data at these increased etravirine exposures is limited , therefore , etravirine and fluconazole should be co - administered with caution .
No dose adjustment of INTELENCE ® or fluconazole is needed .
Co - administration of etravirine and voriconazole significantly increased etravirine exposures .
The amount of safety data at these increased etravirine exposures is limited , therefore , etravirine and voriconazole should be co - administered with caution .
No dose adjustment of INTELENCE ® or voriconazole is needed .
Antifungals : itraconazole , ketoconazole , posaconazole ↑ etravirine ↓ itraconazole ↓ ketoconazole ↔ posaconazole Posaconazole , a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 , may increase plasma concentrations of etravirine .
Itraconazole and ketoconazole are potent inhibitors as well as substrates of CYP3A4 .
Concomitant systemic use of itraconazole or ketoconazole and INTELENCE ® may increase plasma concentrations of etravirine .
Simultaneously , plasma concentrations of itraconazole or ketoconazole may be decreased by INTELENCE ® .
Dose adjustments for itraconazole , ketoconazole or posaconazole may be necessary depending on the other co - administered drugs .
Antiinfectives : clarithromycin null ↑ etravirine ↓ clarithromycin ↑ 14 - OH - clarithromycin Clarithromycin exposure was decreased by INTELENCE ® ; however , concentrations of the active metabolite , 14 - hydroxy - clarithromycin , were increased .
Because 14 - hydroxy - clarithromycin has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium complex ( MAC ) , overall activity against this pathogen may be altered .
Alternatives to clarithromycin , such as azithromycin , should be considered for the treatment of MAC .
Antimycobacterials : rifampin , rifapentine ↓ etravirine Rifampin and rifapentine are potent inducers of CYP450 enzymes .
INTELENCE ® should not be used with rifampin or rifapentine as co - administration may cause significant decreases in etravirine plasma concentrations and loss of therapeutic effect of INTELENCE ® .
Antimycobacterials : rifabutin null ↓ etravirine ↓ rifabutin ↓ 25 - O - desacetylrifabutin If INTELENCE ® is NOT co - administered with a protease inhibitor / ritonavir , then rifabutin at a dose of 300 mg once daily is recommended .
If INTELENCE ® is co - administered with darunavir / ritonavir , lopinavir / ritonavir or saquinavir / ritonavir , then rifabutin should not be co - administered due to the potential for significant reductions in etravirine exposure .
Benzodiazepines : diazepam ↑ diazepam Concomitant use of INTELENCE ® with diazepam may increase plasma concentrations of diazepam .
A decrease in diazepam dose may be needed .
Corticosteroids : dexamethasone ( systemic ) ↓ etravirine Systemic dexamethasone induces CYP3A and can decrease etravirine plasma concentrations .
This may result in loss of therapeutic effect of INTELENCE ® .
Systemic dexamethasone should be used with caution or alternatives should be considered , particularly for long - term use .
Herbal Products : St . John ' s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) ↓ etravirine Concomitant use of INTELENCE ® with products containing St . John ' s wort may cause significant decreases in etravirine plasma concentrations and loss of therapeutic effect of INTELENCE ® .
INTELENCE ® and products containing St . John ' s wort should not be co - administered .
HMG - CoA Reductase Inhibitors : atorvastatin null fluvastatin , lovastatin , pitavastatin , pravastatin , rosuvastatin , simvastatin ↔ etravirine ↓ atorvastatin ↑ 2 - OH - atorvastatin ↔ etravirine ↑ fluvastatin , ↓ lovastatin , ↑ pitavastatin , ↔ pravastatin , ↔ rosuvastatin , ↓ simvastatin The combination of INTELENCE ® and atorvastatin can be given without dose adjustments , however , the dose of atorvastatin may need to be altered based on clinical response .
No interaction between pravastatin , rosuvastatin and INTELENCE ® is expected .
Lovastatin and simvastatin are CYP3A substrates and co - administration with INTELENCE ® may result in lower plasma concentrations of the HMG - CoA reductase inhibitor .
Fluvastatin and pitavastatin are metabolized by CYP2C9 and co - administration with INTELENCE ® may result in higher plasma concentrations of the HMG - CoA reductase inhibitor .
Dose adjustments for these HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors may be necessary .
Immunosuppressants : cyclosporine , sirolimus , tacrolimus ↓ immunosuppressant INTELENCE ® and systemic immunosuppressants should be co - administered with caution because plasma concentrations of cyclosporine , sirolimus , or tacrolimus may be affected .
Narcotic Analgesics / Treatment of Opioid Dependence : buprenorphine , buprenorphine / naloxone null , methadone null ↔ etravirine ↓ buprenorphine ↔ norbuprenorphine ↔ methadone INTELENCE ® and buprenorphine ( or buprenorphine / naloxone ) can be co - administered without dose adjustments , however , clinical monitoring for withdrawal symptoms is recommended as buprenorphine ( or buprenorphine / naloxone ) maintenance therapy may need to be adjusted in some patients .
INTELENCE ® and methadone can be co - administered without dose adjustments , however , clinical monitoring for withdrawal symptoms is recommended as methadone maintenance therapy may need to be adjusted in some patients .
Phosphodiesterase Type 5 ( PDE - 5 ) Inhibitors : sildenafil null , tadalafil , vardenafil ↓ sildenafil ↓ N - desmethyl - sildenafil INTELENCE ® and sildenafil can be co - administered without dose adjustments , however , the dose of sildenafil may need to be altered based on clinical effect .
Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors : clopidogrel ↓ clopidogrel ( active ) metabolite Activation of clopidogrel to its active metabolite may be decreased when clopidogrel is co - administered with INTELENCE ® .
Alternatives to clopidogrel should be considered .
[ 1 ] The interaction between INTELENCE ® and the drug was evaluated in a clinical study .
All other drug interactions shown are predicted .
In addition to the drugs included in Table 3 , the interaction between INTELENCE ® and the following drugs were evaluated in clinical studies and no dose adjustment is needed for either drug [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] : didanosine , enfuvirtide ( ENF ) , ethinylestradiol / norethindrone , omeprazole , paroxetine , raltegravir , ranitidine , and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate .
INTELENCE ® should not be co - administered with the following antiretrovirals : • Tipranavir / ritonavir , fosamprenavir / ritonavir , atazanavir / ritonavir • Protease inhibitors administered without ritonavir • NNRTIs Co - administration of INTELENCE ® with drugs that inhibit or induce CYP3A , CYP2C9 , and / or CYP2C19 may alter the therapeutic effect or adverse reaction profile of etravirine .
( 7 ) Co - administration of INTELENCE ® with drugs that are substrates of CYP3A , CYP2C9 , and / or CYP2C19 or are transported by P - glycoprotein may alter the therapeutic effect or adverse reaction profile of the co - administered drug ( s ) .
( 7 ) Refer to the Full Prescribing Information for other drugs that should not be co - administered with INTELENCE ® and for other drugs that may require a change in dose or regimen .
( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Nursing Mothers : Mothers should not breastfeed due to the potential for HIV transmission .
( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B No adequate and well - controlled studies of INTELENCE ® use in pregnant women have been conducted .
In addition , no pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in pregnant patients .
INTELENCE ® should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry To monitor maternal - fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to INTELENCE ® , an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established .
Physicians are encouraged to register patients by calling 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
Animal Data Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were performed in rabbits ( at oral doses up to 375 mg per kg per day ) and rats ( at oral doses up to 1000 mg per kg per day ) .
In both species , no treatment - related embryo - fetal effects including malformations were observed .
In addition , no treatment - related effects were observed in a separate pre - and postnatal study performed in rats at oral doses up to 500 mg per kg per day .
The systemic drug exposures achieved in these animal studies were equivalent to those at the recommended human dose ( 400 mg per day ) .
8 . 3 Nursing mothers The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV - infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV .
It is not known whether etravirine is secreted in human milk .
Because of both the potential for HIV transmission and the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants , mothers should be instructed not to breastfeed if they are receiving INTELENCE ® .
8 . 4 Pediatric use Treatment with INTELENCE ® is not recommended in children less than 6 years of age .
The pharmacokinetics , safety , tolerability and efficacy of INTELENCE ® in children less than 6 years of age have not been established [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The safety , pharmacokinetic profile , and virologic and immunologic responses of INTELENCE ® were evaluated in treatment - experienced HIV - 1 - infected pediatric subjects 6 years to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 16 kg [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Frequency , type , and severity of adverse drug reactions in pediatric subjects were comparable to those observed in adults , except for rash [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Please see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) for dosing recommendations for pediatric subjects 6 years to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 16 kg .
8 . 5 Geriatric use Clinical studies of INTELENCE ® did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment of INTELENCE ® is required in patients with mild ( Child - Pugh Class A ) or moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B ) hepatic impairment .
The pharmacokinetics of INTELENCE ® have not been evaluated in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment Since the renal clearance of etravirine is negligible ( less than 1 . 2 % ) , a decrease in total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment .
No dose adjustments are required in patients with renal impairment .
As etravirine is highly bound to plasma proteins , it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no specific antidote for overdose with INTELENCE ® .
Human experience of overdose with INTELENCE ® is limited .
The highest dose studied in healthy volunteers was 400 mg once daily .
Treatment of overdose with INTELENCE ® consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient .
If indicated , elimination of unabsorbed active substance is to be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage .
Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid in removal of unabsorbed active substance .
Because etravirine is highly protein bound , dialysis is unlikely to result in significant removal of the active substance .
11 DESCRIPTION INTELENCE ® ( etravirine ) is a non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Etravirine is an antiviral drug [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Effects on Electrocardiogram In a randomized , double - blind , active , and placebo - controlled crossover study , 41 healthy subjects were administered INTELENCE ® 200 mg twice daily , INTELENCE ® 400 mg once daily , placebo , and moxifloxacin 400 mg .
After 8 days of dosing , etravirine did not prolong the QT interval .
The maximum mean ( upper 1 - sided 95 % CI ) baseline and placebo - adjusted QTcF were 0 . 6 ms ( 3 . 3 ms ) for 200 mg twice daily and - 1 . 0 ms ( 2 . 5 ms ) for 400 mg once daily dosing regimens .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetics in Adults The pharmacokinetic properties of INTELENCE ® were determined in healthy adult subjects and in treatment - experienced HIV - 1 - infected adult and pediatric subjects .
The systemic exposures ( AUC ) to etravirine were lower in HIV - 1 - infected subjects than in healthy subjects .
Table 4 : Population Pharmacokinetic Estimates of Etravirine 200 mg twice daily in HIV - 1 - Infected Adult Subjects ( Integrated Data from Phase 3 Trials at Week 48 ) [ 1 ] Parameter Etravirine 200 mg twice daily N = 575 AUC12h ( ng ∙ h / mL ) Geometric Mean ± Standard Deviation 4522 ± 4710 Median ( Range ) 4380 ( 458 – 59084 ) C0h ( ng / mL ) Geometric Mean ± Standard Deviation 297 ± 391 Median ( Range ) 298 ( 2 – 4852 ) [ 1 ] All HIV - 1 - infected subjects enrolled in Phase 3 clinical trials received darunavir / ritonavir 600 / 100 mg twice daily as part of their background regimen .
Therefore , the pharmacokinetic parameter estimates shown in Table 4 account for reductions in the pharmacokinetic parameters of etravirine due to co - administration of INTELENCE ® with darunavir / ritonavir .
Note : The median protein binding adjusted EC50 for MT4 cells infected with HIV - 1 / IIIB in vitro equals 4 ng per mL .
Absorption and Bioavailability Following oral administration , etravirine was absorbed with a Tmax of about 2 . 5 to 4 hours .
The absolute oral bioavailability of INTELENCE ® is unknown .
In healthy subjects , the absorption of etravirine is not affected by co - administration of oral ranitidine or omeprazole , drugs that increase gastric pH . Effects of Food on Oral Absorption The systemic exposure ( AUC ) to etravirine was decreased by about 50 % when INTELENCE ® was administered under fasting conditions , as compared to when INTELENCE ® was administered following a meal .
Therefore , INTELENCE ® should always be taken following a meal .
Within the range of meals studied , the systemic exposures to etravirine were similar .
The total caloric content of the various meals evaluated ranged from 345 kilocalories ( 17 grams fat ) to 1160 kilocalories ( 70 grams fat ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Distribution Etravirine is about 99 . 9 % bound to plasma proteins , primarily to albumin ( 99 . 6 % ) and alpha 1 - acid glycoprotein ( 97 . 66 % to 99 . 02 % ) in vitro .
The distribution of etravirine into compartments other than plasma ( e . g . , cerebrospinal fluid , genital tract secretions ) has not been evaluated in humans .
Metabolism In vitro experiments with human liver microsomes ( HLMs ) indicate that etravirine primarily undergoes metabolism by CYP3A , CYP2C9 , and CYP2C19 enzymes .
The major metabolites , formed by methyl hydroxylation of the dimethylbenzonitrile moiety , were at least 90 % less active than etravirine against wild - type HIV in cell culture .
Elimination After single dose oral administration of 800 mg 14 C - etravirine , 93 . 7 % and 1 . 2 % of the administered dose of 14 C - etravirine was recovered in the feces and urine , respectively .
Unchanged etravirine accounted for 81 . 2 % to 86 . 4 % of the administered dose in feces .
Unchanged etravirine was not detected in urine .
The mean ( ± standard deviation ) terminal elimination half - life of etravirine was about 41 ( ± 20 ) hours .
Special Populations Hepatic Impairment Etravirine is primarily metabolized by the liver .
The steady state pharmacokinetic parameters of etravirine were similar after multiple dose administration of INTELENCE ® to subjects with normal hepatic function ( 16 subjects ) , mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A , 8 subjects ) , and moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class B , 8 subjects ) .
The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of etravirine has not been evaluated .
Hepatitis B and / or Hepatitis C Virus Co - infection Population pharmacokinetic analysis of the TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 trials showed reduced clearance for etravirine in HIV - 1 - infected subjects with hepatitis B and / or C virus co - infection .
Based upon the safety profile of INTELENCE ® [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] , no dose adjustment is necessary in patients co - infected with hepatitis B and / or C virus .
Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of etravirine have not been studied in patients with renal impairment .
The results from a mass balance study with 14 C - etravirine showed that less than 1 . 2 % of the administered dose of etravirine is excreted in the urine as metabolites .
No unchanged drug was detected in the urine .
As etravirine is highly bound to plasma proteins , it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis .
Gender No significant pharmacokinetic differences have been observed between males and females .
Race Population pharmacokinetic analysis of etravirine in HIV - infected subjects did not show an effect of race on exposure to etravirine .
Geriatric Patients Population pharmacokinetic analysis in HIV - infected subjects showed that etravirine pharmacokinetics are not considerably different within the age range ( 18 to 77 years ) evaluated [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of etravirine in 101 treatment - experienced HIV - 1 - infected pediatric subjects , 6 years to less than 18 years of age and weighing at least 16 kg showed that the administered weight - based dosages ( approximately 5 . 2 mg per kg twice daily up to the adult recommended doses ) resulted in etravirine exposure comparable to that in adults receiving INTELENCE ® 200 mg twice daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] when administered at a dose corresponding to 5 . 2 mg per kg twice daily .
The population pharmacokinetic estimates for etravirine AUC12h and C0h are summarized in the table below .
Population pharmacokinetic estimates for etravirine ( all doses combined ) in treatment - experienced HIV - 1 - infected pediatric subjects 6 years to less than 18 years of age ( TMC125 - C213 ) Parameter N = 101 AUC12h ( ng • h / ml ) Geometric Mean ± Standard Deviation 3742 ± 4314 Median ( Range ) 4499 ( 62 – 28865 ) C0h ( ng • h / ml ) Geometric Mean ± Standard Deviation 205 ± 342 Median ( Range ) 287 ( 2 – 2276 ) The pharmacokinetics of etravirine in pediatric subjects less than 6 years of age have not been established .
Drug Interactions [ See also Drug Interactions ( 7 ) . ]
Etravirine is a substrate of CYP3A , CYP2C9 , and CYP2C19 .
Therefore , co - administration of INTELENCE ® with drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A , CYP2C9 , and CYP2C19 may alter the therapeutic effect or adverse reaction profile of INTELENCE ® .
Etravirine is an inducer of CYP3A and inhibitor of CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 and P - glycoprotein .
Therefore , co - administration of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A , CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 or are transported by P - glycoprotein with INTELENCE ® may alter the therapeutic effect or adverse reaction profile of the co - administered drug ( s ) .
Drug interaction studies were performed with INTELENCE ® and other drugs likely to be co - administered and some drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interactions .
The effects of co - administration of other drugs on the AUC , Cmax , and Cmin values of etravirine are summarized in Table 5 ( effect of other drugs on INTELENCE ® ) .
The effect of co - administration of INTELENCE ® on the AUC , Cmax , and Cmin values of other drugs are summarized in Table 6 ( effect of INTELENCE ® on other drugs ) .

Etravirine binds directly to reverse transcriptase ( RT ) and blocks the RNA - dependent and DNA - dependent DNA polymerase activities by causing a disruption of the enzyme ' s catalytic site .
Etravirine does not inhibit the human DNA polymerases α , β , and γ .
Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Etravirine exhibited activity against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of wild - type HIV - 1 in acutely infected T - cell lines , human peripheral blood mononuclear cells , and human monocytes / macrophages with median EC50 values ranging from 0 . 9 to 5 . 5 nM ( i . e . , 0 . 4 to 2 . 4 ng per mL ) .
Etravirine demonstrated antiviral activity in cell culture against a broad panel of HIV - 1 group M isolates ( subtype A , B , C , D , E , F , G ) with EC50 values ranging from 0 . 29 to 1 . 65 nM and EC50 values ranging from 11 . 5 to 21 . 7 nM against group O primary isolates .
Etravirine did not show antagonism when studied in combination with the following antiretroviral drugs — the NNRTIs delavirdine , efavirenz , and nevirapine ; the N ( t ) RTIs abacavir , didanosine , emtricitabine , lamivudine , stavudine , tenofovir , zalcitabine , and zidovudine ; the PIs amprenavir , atazanavir , darunavir , indinavir , lopinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , saquinavir , and tipranavir ; the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide ; the integrase strand transfer inhibitor raltegravir and the CCR5 co - receptor antagonist maraviroc .
Resistance In Cell Culture Etravirine - resistant strains were selected in cell culture originating from wild - type HIV - 1 of different origins and subtypes , as well as NNRTI resistant HIV - 1 .
Development of reduced susceptibility to etravirine typically required more than one substitution in reverse transcriptase of which the following were observed most frequently : L100I , E138K , E138G , V179I , Y181C , and M230I .
In Treatment - Experienced Subjects In the Phase 3 trials TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 , substitutions that developed most commonly in subjects with virologic failure at Week 48 to the INTELENCE ® - containing regimen were V179F , V179I , and Y181C which usually emerged in a background of multiple other NNRTI resistance - associated substitutions .
In all the trials conducted with INTELENCE ® in HIV - 1 infected subjects , the following substitutions emerged most commonly : L100I , E138G , V179F , V179I , Y181C and H221Y .
Other NNRTI - resistance associated substitutions which emerged on etravirine treatment in less than 10 % of the virologic failure isolates included K101E / H / P , K103N / R , V106I / M , V108I , Y181I , Y188L , V189I , G190S / C , N348I and R356K .
The emergence of NNRTI substitutions on etravirine treatment contributed to decreased susceptibility to etravirine with a median fold - change in etravirine susceptibility of 40 - fold from reference and a median fold - change of 6 - fold from baseline .
Cross - Resistance Site - Directed NNRTI Mutant Virus Etravirine showed antiviral activity against 55 of 65 HIV - 1 strains ( 85 % ) with single amino acid substitutions at RT positions associated with NNRTI resistance , including the most commonly found K103N .
The single amino acid substitutions associated with an etravirine reduction in susceptibility greater than 3 - fold were K101A , K101P , K101Q , E138G , E138Q , Y181C , Y181I , Y181T , Y181V , and M230L , and of these , the greatest reductions were Y181I ( 13 - fold change in EC50 value ) and Y181V ( 17 - fold change in EC50 value ) .
Mutant strains containing a single NNRTI resistance associated substitution ( K101P , K101Q , E138Q , or M230L ) had cross - resistance between etravirine and efavirenz .
The majority ( 39 of 61 ; 64 % ) of the NNRTI mutant viruses with 2 or 3 amino acid substitutions associated with NNRTI resistance had decreased susceptibility to etravirine ( fold - change greater than 3 ) .
The highest levels of resistance to etravirine were observed for HIV - 1 harboring a combination of substitutions V179F + Y181C ( 187 fold - change ) , V179F + Y181I ( 123 fold - change ) , or V179F + Y181C + F227C ( 888 fold - change ) .
Clinical Isolates Etravirine retained a fold - change less than or equal to 3 against 60 % of 6171 NNRTI - resistant clinical isolates .
In the same panel , the proportion of clinical isolates resistant to delavirdine , efavirenz and / or nevirapine ( defined as a fold - change above their respective biological cutoff values in the assay ) was 79 % , 87 % , and 95 % , respectively .
In TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 , 34 % of the baseline isolates had decreased susceptibility to etravirine ( fold - change greater than 3 ) and 60 % , 69 % , and 78 % of all baseline isolates were resistant to delavirdine , efavirenz , and nevirapine , respectively .
Of subjects who received etravirine and were virologic failures in TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 , 90 % , 84 % , and 96 % of viral isolates obtained at the time of treatment failure were resistant to delavirdine , efavirenz , and nevirapine , respectively .
Therefore , cross - resistance to delavirdine , efavirenz , and / or nevirapine is expected after virologic failure with an etravirine - containing regimen for the virologic failure isolates .
Treatment - naïve HIV - 1 - infected subjects in the Phase 3 trials for EDURANT ( rilpivirine ) There are currently no clinical data available on the use of etravirine in subjects who experienced virologic failure on a rilpivirine - containing regimen .
However , in the rilpivirine adult clinical development program , there was evidence of phenotypic cross - resistance between rilpivirine and etravirine .
In the pooled analyses of the Phase 3 clinical trials for rilpivirine , 38 rilpivirine virologic failure subjects had evidence of HIV - 1 strains with genotypic and phenotypic resistance to rilpivirine .
Of these subjects , 89 % ( 34 subjects ) of virologic failure isolates were cross - resistant to etravirine based on phenotype data .
Consequently , it can be inferred that cross - resistance to etravirine is likely after virologic failure and development of rilpivirine resistance .
Refer to the prescribing information for EDURANT ( rilpivirine ) for further information .
Baseline Genotype / Phenotype and Virologic Outcome Analyses In TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 , the presence at baseline of the substitutions L100I , E138A , I167V , V179D , V179F , Y181I , Y181V , or G190S was associated with a decreased virologic response to etravirine .
Additional substitutions associated with a decreased virologic response to etravirine when in the presence of 3 or more additional 2008 IAS - USA defined NNRTI substitutions include A98G , K101H , K103R , V106I , V179T , and Y181C .
The presence of K103N , which was the most prevalent NNRTI substitution in TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 at baseline , did not affect the response in the INTELENCE ® arm .
Overall , response rates to etravirine decreased as the number of baseline NNRTI substitutions increased ( shown as the proportion of subjects achieving viral load less than 50 plasma HIV RNA copies per mL at Week 48 ) ( Table 7 ) .

Each drug in the background therapy was scored as a ' 1 ' or ' 0 ' based on whether the viral isolate was considered susceptible or resistant to that drug , respectively .
In the calculation of the PSS , darunavir was counted as a sensitive antiretroviral if the FC was less than or equal to 10 ; enfuvirtide was counted as a sensitive antiretroviral if it had not been used previously .
INTELENCE ® was not included in this calculation .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Etravirine was evaluated for carcinogenic potential by oral gavage administration to mice and rats for up to approximately 104 weeks .
Daily doses of 50 , 200 and 400 mg per kg were administered to mice and doses of 70 , 200 and 600 mg per kg were administered to rats in the initial period of approximately 41 to 52 weeks .
The high and middle doses were subsequently adjusted due to tolerability and reduced by 50 % in mice and by 50 to 66 % in rats to allow for completion of the studies .
In the mouse study , statistically significant increases in the incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma and incidences of hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas combined were observed in treated females .
In the rat study , no statistically significant increases in tumor findings were observed in either sex .
The relevance of these liver tumor findings in mice to humans is not known .
Because of tolerability of the formulation in these rodent studies , maximum systemic drug exposures achieved at the doses tested were lower than those in humans at the clinical dose ( 400 mg per day ) , with animal vs . human AUC ratios being 0 . 6 - fold ( mice ) and 0 . 2 – 0 . 7 - fold ( rats ) .
Mutagenesis Etravirine tested negative in the in vitro Ames reverse mutation assay , in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocyte , and in vitro clastogenicity mouse lymphoma assay , tested in the absence and presence of a metabolic activation system .
Etravirine did not induce chromosomal damage in the in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
Impairment of Fertility No effects on fertility and early embryonic development were observed when etravirine was tested in rats at maternal doses up to 500 mg per kg per day , resulting in systemic drug exposure up to the recommended human dose ( 400 mg per day ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Treatment - Experienced Adult Subjects The clinical efficacy of INTELENCE ® is derived from the analyses of 48 - week data from 2 ongoing , randomized , double - blinded , placebo - controlled , Phase 3 trials , TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 ( DUET - 1 and DUET - 2 ) .
These trials are identical in design and the results below are pooled data from the two trials .
TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 are Phase 3 studies designed to evaluate the safety and antiretroviral activity of INTELENCE ® in combination with a background regimen ( BR ) as compared to placebo in combination with a BR .
Eligible subjects were treatment - experienced HIV - 1 - infected patients with plasma HIV - 1 RNA greater than 5000 copies per mL while on an antiretroviral regimen for at least 8 weeks .
In addition , subjects had 1 or more NNRTI resistance - associated mutations at screening or from prior genotypic analysis , and 3 or more of the following primary PI mutations at screening : D30N , V32I , L33F , M46I / L , I47A / V , G48V , I50L / V , V82A / F / L / S / T , I84V , N88S , or L90M .
Randomization was stratified by the intended use of enfuvirtide ( ENF ) in the BR , previous use of darunavir / ritonavir ( DRV / rtv ) , and screening viral load .
Virologic response was defined as HIV - 1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL at Week 48 .
All study subjects received DRV / rtv as part of their BR , and at least 2 other investigator - selected antiretroviral drugs ( N [ t ] RTIs with or without ENF ) .
Of INTELENCE ® - treated subjects , 25 . 5 % used ENF for the first time ( de novo ) and 20 . 0 % re - used ENF .
Of placebo - treated subjects , 26 . 5 % used de novo ENF and 20 . 4 % re - used ENF .
In the pooled analysis for TMC125 - C206 and TMC125 - C216 , demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced between the INTELENCE ® arm and the placebo arm .

The mean decrease in plasma HIV - 1 RNA from baseline to Week 48 was - 2 . 23 log10 copies per mL for INTELENCE ® - treated subjects and - 1 . 46 log10 copies per mL for placebo - treated subjects .
The mean CD4 + cell count increase from baseline for INTELENCE ® - treated subjects was 96 cells per mm3 and 68 cells per mm3 for placebo - treated subjects .
Of the study population who either re - used or did not use ENF , 57 . 4 % of INTELENCE ® - treated subjects and 31 . 7 % of placebo - treated subjects achieved HIV - 1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL .
Of the study population using ENF de novo , 67 . 3 % of INTELENCE ® - treated subjects and 57 . 2 % of placebo - treated subjects achieved HIV - 1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL .
Treatment - emergent CDC category C events occurred in 4 % of INTELENCE ® - treated subjects and 8 . 4 % of placebo - treated subjects .
Study TMC125 - C227 was a randomized , exploratory , active - controlled , open - label , Phase 2 b trial .
Eligible subjects were treatment - experienced , PI - naïve HIV - 1 - infected patients with genotypic evidence of NNRTI resistance at screening or from prior genotypic analysis .
The virologic response was evaluated in 116 subjects who were randomized to INTELENCE ® ( 59 subjects ) or an investigator - selected PI ( 57 subjects ) , each given with 2 investigator - selected N ( t ) RTIs .
INTELENCE ® - treated subjects had lower antiviral responses associated with reduced susceptibility to the N ( t ) RTIs and to INTELENCE ® as compared to the control PI - treated subjects .
