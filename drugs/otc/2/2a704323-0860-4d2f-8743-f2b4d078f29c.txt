( Ergotamine Tartrate Sublingual Tablets , USP ) Rx Only WARNING Serious and / or life - threatening peripheral ischemia has been associated with the coadministration of ergotamine tartrate with potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors including protease inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics .
Because CYP 3A4 inhibition elevates the serum levels of ergotamine tartrate , the risk for vasospasm leading to cerebral ischemia and / or ischemia of the extremities is increased .
Hence , concomitant use of these medications is contraindicated .
( See also CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS section ) DESCRIPTION : Ergomar ® Sublingual Tablets Ergotamine Tartrate Sublingual Tablets USP ... 2 mg Inactive Ingredients : Microcrystalline Cellulose NF , Natural Peppermint Flavor Powder , Crospovidone NF , Saccharin Sodium USP Powder , D & C Yellow # 10 Lake , Magnesium Stearate NF , FD & C Blue # 1 Aluminum Lake .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Ergotamine is an alpha adrenergic blocking agent with a direct stimulating effect on the smooth muscle of peripheral and cranial blood vessels and produces depression of central vasomotor centers .
The compound also has the properties of serotonin antagonism .
In comparison to hydrogenated ergotamine , the adrenergic blocking actions are less pronounced and vasoconstrictive actions are greater .
Pharmacokinetics : Interactions Pharmacokinetic interactions ( increased blood levels of ergotamine ) have been reported in patients treated orally with ergotamine and macrolide antibiotics ( e . g . , troleandomycin , clarithromycin , erythromycin ) , and in patients treated orally with ergotamine and protease inhibitors ( e . g . , ritonavir ) presumably due to inhibition of cytochrome P450 3 A metabolism of ergotamine ( See CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Ergotamine has also been shown to be an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3 A catalyzed reactions .
No pharmacokinetic interactions involving other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are known .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ergomar ® is indicated as therapy to abort or prevent vascular headache , e . g . , migraine , migraine variants or so - called " histaminic cephalalgia " .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Coadministration of ergotamine with potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors ( ritonavir , nelfinavir , indinavir , erythromycin , clarithromycin and troleandomycin ) has been associated with acute ergot toxicity ( ergotism ) characterized by vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities ( See PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions ) , with some cases resulting in amputation .
There have been rare reports of cerebral ischemia in patients on protease inhibitor therapy when ergotamine was coadministered , at least one resulting in death .
Because of the increased risk for ergotism and other serious vasospastic adverse events , ergotamine use is contraindicated with these drugs and other potent inhibitors of CYP 3A4 ( e . g . , ketoconazole , itraconazole ) ( See WARNINGS : CYP 3A4 Inhibitors ) .
Ergomar ® Sublingual Tablets may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women .
Ergomar ® Sublingual Tablets are contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant .
If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this product , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus .
Peripheral vascular disease , coronary heart disease , hypertension , impaired hepatic or renal function and sepsis .
Hypersensitivity to any of the components .
WARNINGS CYP 3A4 Inhibitors ( e . g . , Macrolide Antibiotics and Protease Inhibitors ) Coadministration of ergotamine with potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as protease inhibitors or macrolide antibiotics has been associated with serious adverse events ; for this reason , these drugs should not be given concomitantly with ergotamine ( See CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
While these reactions have not been reported with less potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors , there is a potential risk for serious toxicity including vasospasm when these drugs are used with ergotamine .
Examples of less potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors include : saquinavir , nefazodone , fluconazole , fluoxetine , grapefruit juice , fluvoxamine , zileuton , metronidazole , and clotrimazole .
These lists are not exhaustive , and the prescriber should consider the effects on CYP 3A4 of other agents being considered for concomitant use with ergotamine .
Fibrotic Complications There have been a few reports of patients on ergotamine tartrate and caffeine therapy developing retroperitoneal and / or pleuropulmonary fibrosis .
There have also been rare reports of fibrotic thickening of the aortic , mitral , tricuspid , and / or pulmonary valves with long - term continuous use of ergotamine tartrate and caffeine .
Ergomar ® Sublingual Tablets should not be used for chronic daily administration ( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
PRECAUTIONS General Although signs and symptoms of ergotism rarely develop even after long term intermittent use of the drug , care should be exercised to remain within the limits of recommended dosage .
Ergotism is manifested by intense arterial vasoconstriction , producing signs and symptoms of peripheral vascular ischemia .
Ergotamine induces vasoconstriction by a direct action on vascular smooth muscle .
In chronic intoxication with ergot derivatives , headache , intermittent claudication , muscle pains , numbness , coldness and pallor of the digits may occur .
If the condition is allowed to progress untreated , gangrene can result .
While most cases of ergotism associated with ergotamine treatment result from frank overdosage , some cases have involved apparent hypersensitivity .
There are few reports of ergotism among patients taking doses within the recommended limits or for brief periods of time .
In rare instances , patients , particularly those who have used the medication indiscriminately over long periods of time , may display withdrawal symptoms consisting of rebound headache upon discontinuation of the drug .
Information for Patients Patients should be advised that one Ergomar ® Sublingual Tablet should be taken at the first sign of a migraine headache .
No more than 2 tablets should be taken for any single migraine attack .
No more than 5 tablets should be taken during any 7 - day period .
Administration of Ergomar ® Sublingual Tablets should not exceed the dosing guidelines and should not be used for chronic daily administration ( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Ergomar ® Sublingual Tablets should be used only for migraine headaches .
It is not effective for other types of headaches and it lacks analgesic properties .
Patients should be advised to report to the physician immediately any of the following : numbness or tingling in the fingers and toes , muscle pain in the arms and legs , weakness in the legs , pain in the chest or temporary speeding or slowing of the heart rate , swelling or itching .
Drug Interactions CYP 3A4 Inhibitors ( e . g . , Macrolide Antibiotics and Protease inhibitors ) See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS .
Ergomar ® Sublingual Tablets ( Ergotamine Tartrate Sublingual Tablets USP ) should not be administered with other vasoconstrictors .
Use with sympathomimetics ( pressor agents ) may cause extreme elevation of blood pressure .
The beta - blocker Inderal ( propranolol ) has been reported to potentiate the vasoconstrictive action of ergotamine by blocking the vasodilating property of epinephrine .
Nicotine may provoke vasoconstriction in some patients , predisposing to a greater ischemic response to ergot therapy .
The blood levels of ergotamine - containing drugs are reported to be elevated by the concomitant administration of macrolide antibiotics and vasospastic reactions have been reported with therapeutic doses of the ergotamine - containing drugs when coadministered with these antibiotics .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category X : There are no studies on the placental transfer or teratogenicity of Ergomar ® .
Ergotamine crosses the placenta in small amounts , although it does not appear to be embryotoxic in this quantity .
However , prolonged vasoconstriction of the uterine vessels and / or increased myometrial tone leading to reduced myometrial and placental blood flow may have contributed to fetal growth retardation observed in animals .
( See CONTRAINDICATIONS ) Nonteratogenic Effects Ergomar ® is contraindicated in pregnancy due to its oxytocic effects of ergotamine ( See CONTRAINDICATIONS ) Labor and Delivery Ergomar ® is contraindicated in pregnancy due to its oxytocic effect which is maximal in the third trimester .
( See CONTRAINDICATIONS ) Nursing Mothers Ergot drugs are known to inhibit prolactin but there are no reports of decreased lactation with Ergomar ® .
Ergotamine is excreted in breast milk and may cause symptoms of vomiting , diarrhea , weak pulse and unstable blood pressure in nursing infants .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Ergomar ® , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Cardiovascular : Vasoconstrictive complications of a serious nature may occur at times .
These include ischemia , cyanosis , absence of pulse , cold extremities , gangrene , precordial distress and pain , EKG changes and muscle pains .
Although these effects occur most commonly with long - term therapy at relatively high doses , they have also been reported with short - term or normal doses .
Other cardiovascular adverse effects include transient tachycardia or bradycardia and hypertension .
Gastrointestinal : Nausea and vomiting .
Neurological : paresthesias , numbness , weakness , and vertigo .
Allergic : Localized edema and itching .
Fibrotic Complications : ( See WARNINGS ) .
DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE There have been reports of drug abuse and psychological dependence in patients on ergotamine tartrate therapy .
Due to the chronicity of vascular headaches , it is imperative that patients be advised not to exceed recommended dosages with long - term use to avoid ergotism .
( See PRECAUTIONS ) OVERDOSAGE Symptoms include vomiting , numbness , tingling , pain and cyanosis of the extremities associated with diminished or absent peripheral pulses ; hypertension or hypotension ; drowsiness , stupor , coma , convulsions and shock .
A case has been reported of reversible bilateral papillitis with ring scotomata in a patient who received five times the recommended daily adult dose over a period of 14 days .
Treatment consists of removal of the offending drug .
Maintenance of adequate pulmonary ventilation , correction of hypotension , and control of convulsions and blood pressure are important considerations .
Treatment of peripheral vasospasm should consist of warmth , but not heat , and protection of the ischemic limbs .
Vasodilators may be beneficial but caution must be exercised to avoid aggravating an already existent hypotension .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Procedure For best results , dosage should start at the first sign of an attack .
Early Administration Gives Maximum Effectiveness .
At the first sign of an attack or to relieve symptoms after onset of an attack , one 2 mg tablet is placed under the tongue .
Another tablet should be taken at half - hour intervals thereafter , if necessary , but dosage must not exceed three tablets in any 24 hour period .
