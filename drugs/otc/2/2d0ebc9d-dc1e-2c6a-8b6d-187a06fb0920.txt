Examples include women who are known to : • • Smoke , if over age 35 [ see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Have deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism , now or in the past [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Have inherited or acquired hypercoagulopathies [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Have cerebrovascular disease [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Have coronary artery disease [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Have thrombogenic valvular or thrombogenic rhythm diseases of the heart ( for example , subacute bacterial endocarditis with valvular disease , or atrial fibrillation ) [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Have uncontrolled hypertension [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 4 ) ] • • Have diabetes mellitus with vascular disease [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 6 ) ] • • Have headaches with focal neurological symptoms or migraine headaches with aura [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 7 ) ] • ▪ Women over age 35 with any migraine headaches [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 7 ) ] • • Liver tumors , benign or malignant , or liver disease [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 2 ) ] • • Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 8 ) ] • • Pregnancy , because there is no reason to use COCs during pregnancy [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 9 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8 . 1 ) ] • • Current diagnosis of , or history of , breast cancer , which may be hormone - sensitive [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 11 ) ] • • Use of Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir , due to the potential for ALT elevations [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 3 ) ] • • A high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic diseases ( 4 ) • • Liver tumors or liver disease ( 4 ) • • Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding ( 4 ) • • Pregnancy ( 4 ) • • Current diagnosis of , or history of , breast cancer , which may be hormone - sensitive ( 4 ) • • Co - administration with Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems : Stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if a thrombotic event occurs .
Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery .
Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery , in women who are not breastfeeding .
( 5 . 1 ) • • Liver disease : Discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if jaundice occurs .
( 5 . 2 ) • • High blood pressure : If used in women with well - controlled hypertension , monitor blood pressure and stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if blood pressure rises significantly .
( 5 . 4 ) • • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects : Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol .
Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia .
( 5 . 6 ) • • Headache : Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if indicated .
( 5 . 7 ) • • Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea : Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea .
( 5 . 8 ) 5 . 1 Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems • • Stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thrombotic ( VTE ) event occurs .
• • Stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if there is unexplained loss of vision , proptosis , diplopia , papilledema , or retinal vascular lesions .
Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [ see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
• • If feasible , stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization .
• • Start norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery , in women who are not breastfeeding .
The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week , whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week .
• • The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE .
However , pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs .
The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10 , 000 woman - years .
The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer .
The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued .
• • Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions , especially in women with other risk factors for these events .
COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events ( thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes ) .
This risk increases with age , particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke .
• • Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors .
5 . 2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Impaired Liver Function Do not use norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol in women with liver disease , such as acute viral hepatitis or severe ( decompensated ) cirrhosis of liver [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ] .
Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded .
Discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if jaundice develops .
Liver Tumors Liver Tumors Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ] .
Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use .
An estimate of the attributable risk is 3 . 3 cases / 100 , 000 COC users .
Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra - abdominal hemorrhage .
Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long - term ( > 8 years ) COC users .
However , the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users .
5 . 3 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir , ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) , including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN , were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol - containing medications , such as COCs .
Discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ] .
Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen .
5 . 4 High Blood Pressure Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ] .
For women with well - controlled hypertension , monitor blood pressure and stop norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if blood pressure rises significantly .
An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs , and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use .
The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin .
5 . 5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users .
Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease .
A past history of COC - related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use .
Women with a history of pregnancy - related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis .
5 . 6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol .
COCs may decrease glucose tolerance .
Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia .
A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs .
Women with hypertriglyceridemia , or a family history thereof , may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs .
5 . 7 Headache If a woman taking norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol develops new headaches that are recurrent , persistent , or severe , evaluate the cause and discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if indicated .
Consider discontinuation of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use ( which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event ) .
5 . 8 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled ( breakthrough or intracyclic ) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs , especially during the first three months of use .
If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles , check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy .
If pathology and pregnancy are excluded , bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product .
In the clinical trial of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol , the frequency and duration of unscheduled bleeding and / or spotting was assessed in 1 , 673 women ( 11 , 015 evaluable cycles ) .
A total of 3 ( 0 . 2 % ) women discontinued norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol , at least in part , due to bleeding or spotting .
Based on data from the clinical trials , 7 to 17 % of women using norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year .
The percent of women who experienced unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time .
Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who use norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol may experience amenorrhea .
Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs , especially when such a condition was pre - existent .
If scheduled ( withdrawal ) bleeding does not occur , consider the possibility of pregnancy .
If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule ( missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have ) , consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures .
If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods , rule out pregnancy .
5 . 9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy .
Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect , particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned , when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy .
Discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol use if pregnancy is confirmed .
Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [ see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 10 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol if depression recurs to a serious degree .
5 . 11 Malignant Neoplasms Breast Cancer Tri - Lo - Estarylla is contraindicated in females who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between use of combined oral contraceptives ( COCs ) and breast cancer risk .
Studies do not show an association between ever ( current or past ) use of COCs and risk of breast cancer .
However , some studies report a smallincrease in the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users ( < 6 months since last use ) and current users with longer duration of COC use [ see Postmarketing Experience ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Cervical Cancer Some studies suggest that COC use has beenassociated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia .
However , there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors .
5 . 12 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine - binding globulin , sex hormone - binding globulin , and cortisol - binding globulin .
The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased .
5 . 13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare .
5 . 14 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema , exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema .
5 . 15 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur , especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum .
Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol .
5 . 16 Risk of Allergic Reactions Due to Tartrazine This product contains FD & C Yellow No . 5 ( tartrazine ) which may cause allergic - type reactions ( including bronchial asthma ) in certain susceptible persons .
Although the overall incidence of FD & C Yellow No . 5 ( tartrazine ) sensitivity in the general population is low , it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions with the use of COCs are discussed elsewhere in labeling : • • Serious cardiovascular events and stroke [ see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Vascular events [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Liver disease [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 2 ) ] Adverse reactions commonly reported by COC users are : • • Irregular uterine bleeding • • Nausea • • Breast tenderness • • Headache The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials ( ≥ 2 % ) were : headache / migraine , nausea / vomiting , breast issues , abdominal pain , menstrual disorders , mood disorders , acne , vulvovaginal infection , abdominal distension , weight increased , fatigue .

6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
The safety of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol was evaluated in 1 , 723 subjects who participated in a randomized , partially blinded , multicenter , active - controlled clinical trial of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol for contraception .
This trial examined healthy , nonpregnant , volunteers aged 18 to 45 ( nonsmoker if 35 to 45 years of age ) , who were sexually active with regular coitus .
Subjects were followed for up to 13 28 - day cycles .
Common Adverse Reactions Common Adverse Reactions ( ≥ 2 % of subjects ) The most common adverse reactions reported by at least 2 % of the 1 , 723 women using the 28 - day regimen were the following in order of decreasing incidence : headache / migraine ( 30 . 5 % ) , nausea / vomiting ( 16 . 3 % ) ; breast issues ( including tenderness , pain , enlargement , swelling , discharge , discomfort , cyst , and nipple pain ) ( 10 . 3 % ) , abdominal pain ( 9 . 2 % ) , menstrual disorders ( including dysmenorrhea , menstrual discomfort , menstrual disorder ) ( 9 . 2 % ) , mood disorders ( including depression , mood altered , mood swings and depressed mood ) ( 7 . 6 % ) ; acne ( 5 . 1 % ) , vulvovaginal infection ( 3 . 5 % ) , abdominal distension ( 2 . 8 % ) , weight increased ( 2 . 4 % ) , fatigue ( 2 . 1 % ) .
Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation Adverse Reactions Leading to Study Discontinuation In the clinical trial of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol 4 % of subjects discontinued the trial due to an adverse reaction .
The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were headache / migraine ( 1 . 2 % ) , nausea / vomiting ( 0 . 7 % ) , cervical dysplasia ( 0 . 7 % ) , abdominal pain ( 0 . 4 % ) , ovarian cyst ( 0 . 3 % ) , acne ( 0 . 2 % ) , flatulence ( 0 . 2 % ) and depression ( 0 . 2 % ) .
Serious Adverse Reactions Serious Adverse Reactions Carcinoma of the cervix in situ ( 1 subject ) and cervical dysplasia ( 1 subject ) .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Post Marketing Experience Five studies that compared breast cancer risk between ever - users ( current or past use ) of COCs and never - users of COCs reported no association between ever use of COCs and breast cancer risk , with effect estimates ranging from 0 . 90 - 1 . 12 ( Figure 2 ) .
Three studies compared breast cancer risk between current or recent COC users ( < 6 months since last use ) and never users of COCs ( Figure 2 ) .
One of these studies reported no association between breast cancer risk and COC use .
The other two studies found an increased relative risk of 1 . 19 - 1 . 33 with current or recent use .
Both of these studies found an increased risk of breast cancer with current use of longer duration , with relative risks ranging from 1 . 03 with less than one year of COC use to approximately 1 . 4 with more than 8 - 10 years of COC use .
Figure 2 : Risk of Breast Cancer with Combined Oral Contraceptive Use [ MULTIMEDIA ] RR = relative risk ; OR = odds ratio ; HR = hazard ratio .
“ ever COC ” are females with current or past COC use ; “ never COC use ” are females that never used COCs .
The following additional adverse drug reactions have been reported from worldwide postmarketing experience with norgestimate / ethinyl estradiol .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Infections and Infestations : Urinary tract infection Neoplasms Benign , Malignant and Unspecified ( Including Cysts and Polyps ) : Breast cancer , benign breast neoplasm , hepatic adenoma , focal nodular hyperplasia , breast cyst Immune System Disorders : Hypersensitivity Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders : Dyslipidemia Psychiatric Disorders : Anxiety , insomnia Nervous System Disorders : Syncope , convulsion , paresthesia , dizziness Eye Disorders : Visual impairment , dry eye , contact lens intolerance Ear and Labyrinth Disorders : Vertigo Cardiac Disorders : Tachycardia , palpitations Vascular Events : Deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , retinal vascular thrombosis , hot flush Arterial Events : Arterial thromboembolism , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident Respiratory , Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders : Dyspnea Gastrointestinal Disorders : Pancreatitis , abdominal distension , diarrhea , constipation Hepatobiliary Disorders : Hepatitis Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Angioedema , erythema nodosum , hirsutism , night sweats , hyperhidrosis , photosensitivity reaction , urticaria , pruritus , acne Musculoskeletal , Connective Tissue , and Bone Disorders : Muscle spasms , pain in extremity , myalgia , back pain Reproductive System and Breast Disorders : Ovarian cyst , suppressed lactation , vulvovaginal dryness General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : Chest pain , asthenic conditions .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations .
No drug - drug interaction studies were conducted with norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol .
Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes including CYP3A4 , may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding .
Counsel patients to use a back - up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs Substances Decreasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes , including cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) , may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding .
Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of COCs include phenytoin , barbiturates , carbamazepine , bosentan , felbamate , griseofulvin , oxcarbazepine , rifampicin , topiramate , rifabutin , rufinamide , aprepitant and products containing St . John ' s wort .
Interactions between COCs and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and / or contraceptive failure .
Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back - up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs , and to continue back - up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability .
Colesevelam Colesevelam Colesevelam , a bile acid sequestrant , given together with a COC , has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of ethinyl estradiol ( EE ) .
The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart .
Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs Substances Increasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs Co - administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20 to 25 % .
Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations , possibly by inhibition of conjugation .
CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole , voriconazole , fluconazole , grapefruit juice , or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations .
Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) / Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) Protease Inhibitors and Non - nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Significant changes ( increase or decrease ) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and / or progestin have been noted in some cases of co - administration with HIV protease inhibitors ( decrease [ e . g . , nelfinavir , ritonavir , darunavir / ritonavir , ( fos ) amprenavir / ritonavir , lopinavir / ritonavir , and tipranavir / ritonavir ] or increase [ e . g . , indinavir and atazanavir / ritonavir ] ) / HCV protease inhibitors ( decrease [ e . g . , boceprevir and telaprevir ] ) or with non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( decrease [ e . g . , nevirapine ] or increase [ e . g . , etravirine ] ) .
7 . 2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs • • COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds ( e . g . , cyclosporine , prednisolone , theophylline , tizanidine , and voriconazole ) and increase their plasma concentrations .
• • COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen , clofibric acid , morphine , salicylic acid , temazepam and lamotrigine .
Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown , likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation .
This may reduce seizure control ; therefore , dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary .
Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid - binding globulin increases with use of COCs .
7 . 3 Interference with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests , such as coagulation factors , lipids , glucose tolerance , and binding proteins .

Liver Enzyme Elevation Do not co - administer norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir , due to potential for ALT elevations [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 3 ) ] 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers : Not recommended ; can decrease milk production .
( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy There is little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who inadvertently use COCs during early pregnancy .
Epidemiologic studies and meta - analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non - genital birth defects ( including cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects ) following exposure to low dose COCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy .
Do not administer COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding as a test for pregnancy .
Do not use COCs during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Advise the nursing mother to use other forms of contraception , when possible , until she has weaned her child .
COCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers .
This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well - established ; however , it can occur at any time in some women .
Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and / or metabolites are present in breast milk .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol have been established in women of reproductive age .
Efficacy is expected to be the same for post - pubertal adolescents under the age of 18 and for users 18 years and older .
Use of this product before menarche is not indicated .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol has not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol has not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment .
However , steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with hepatic impairment .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action COCs lower the risk of becoming pregnant primarily by suppressing ovulation .
Other possible mechanisms may include cervical mucus changes that inhibit sperm penetration and endometrial changes that reduce the likelihood of implantation .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Absorption Norgestimate ( NGM ) and EE are rapidly absorbed following oral administration .
NGM is rapidly and completely metabolized by first pass ( intestinal and / or hepatic ) mechanisms to norelgestromin ( NGMN ) and norgestrel ( NG ) , which are the major active metabolites of NGM .
Mean pharmacokinetic parameters for NGMN , NG and EE during three cycles of administration of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol are summarized in Table 3 .
Peak serum concentrations of NGMN and EE were generally reached by 2 hours after administration of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol .
Accumulation following multiple dosing of the 0 . 180 mg NGM / 0 . 025 mg EE dose is approximately 1 . 5 to 2 fold for NGMN and approximately 1 . 5 fold for EE compared with single dose administration , in agreement with that predicted based on linear kinetics of NGMN and EE .
The pharmacokinetics of NGMN is dose proportional following NGM doses of 0 . 180 to 0 . 250 mg .
Steady - state conditions for NGMN following each NGM dose and for EE were achieved during the three cycle study .
Non - linear accumulation ( 4 . 5 – 14 . 5 fold ) of NG was observed as a result of high affinity binding to SHBG , which limits its biological activity .

Distribution Distribution NGMN and NG are highly bound ( > 97 % ) to serum proteins .
NGMN is bound to albumin and not to SHBG , while NG is bound primarily to SHBG .
EE is extensively bound ( > 97 % ) to serum albumin and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of SHBG .
Metabolism Metabolism NGM is extensively metabolized by first - pass mechanisms in the gastrointestinal tract and / or liver .
NGM ' s primary active metabolite is NGMN .
Subsequent hepatic metabolism of NGMN occurs and metabolites include NG , which is also active and various hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites .
Although NGMN and its metabolites inhibit a variety of P450 enzymes in human liver microsomes , under the recommended dosing regimen , the in vivo concentrations of NGMN and its metabolites , even at the peak serum levels , are relatively low compared to the inhibitory constant ( Ki ) .
EE is also metabolized to various hydroxylated products and their glucuronide and sulfate conjugates .
Excretion Excretion Following 3 cycles of administration of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol , the mean ( ± SD ) elimination half - life values , at steady - state , for NGMN , NG and EE were 28 . 1 ( ± 10 . 6 ) hours , 36 . 4 ( ± 10 . 2 ) hours and 17 . 7 ( ± 4 . 4 ) hours , respectively ( Table 2 ) .
The metabolites of NGMN and EE are eliminated by renal and fecal pathways .
Use in Specific Populations Use in Specific Populations Effects of Body Weight , Body Surface Area , and Age Effects of Body Weight , Body Surface Area , and Age The effects of body weight , body surface area , age and race on the pharmacokinetics of NGMN , NG and EE were evaluated in 79 healthy women using pooled data following single dose administration of NGM 0 . 180 or 0 . 250 mg / EE 0 . 025 mg tablets in four pharmacokinetic studies .
Increasing body weight and body surface area were each associated with decreases in Cmax and AUC0 – 24 h values for NGMN and EE and increases in CL / F ( oral clearance ) for EE .
Increasing body weight by 10 kg is predicted to reduce the following parameters : NGMN Cmax by 9 % and AUC0 – 24 h by 19 % , NG Cmax by 12 % and AUC0 – 24 h by 46 % , EE Cmax by 13 % and AUC0 – 24 h by 12 % .
These changes were statistically significant .
Increasing age was associated with slight decreases ( 6 % with increasing age by 5 years ) in Cmax and AUC0 – 24 h for NGMN and were statistically significant , but there was no significant effect for NG or EE .
Only a small to moderate fraction ( 5 to 40 % ) of the overall variability in the pharmacokinetics of NGMN and EE following norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets may be explained by any or all of the above demographic parameters .
