6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug product cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
Clinical trials have been performed with RECOTHROM thrombin applied with absorbable gelatin sponge and applied with a spray applicator .
A total of 644 patients were exposed to RECOTHROM in these studies .
RECOTHROM Thrombin Used in Conjunction with Absorbable Gelatin Sponge Four hundred eleven ( 411 ) patients were treated in a randomized , double - blind , controlled trial that compared RECOTHROM to bovine thrombin .
Both thrombins were applied with a gelatin sponge in patients undergoing spinal surgery , hepatic resection , peripheral arterial bypass surgery , or arteriovenous graft formation for hemodialysis access . 1 The incidence of thromboembolic adverse reactions was similar between the RECOTHROM and bovine thrombin treatment groups ( see Table 1 ) .
Table 1 : Incidence of Adverse Reactions with RECOTHROM Thrombin and Bovine ThrombinAdverse Reaction Category RECOTHROM ( N = 205 ) n ( % ) Bovine Thrombin [ 1 ] ( N = 206 ) n ( % ) Thromboembolic events 11 ( 5 % ) 12 ( 6 % ) [ 1 ] THROMBIN - JMI Thrombin , Topical ( Bovine ) In an open - label , single - group trial ( N = 209 ) , patients with documented or highly likely prior exposure to bovine thrombin within the previous three years were treated with RECOTHROM when undergoing surgeries ( spinal , peripheral arterial bypass , or arteriovenous graft formation for hemodialysis access ) . 2 The incidence of thromboembolic adverse reactions in this study was 9 % .
In an open - label , single - group trial of re - exposure to RECOTHROM ( N = 31 ) , patients with documented prior exposure to RECOTHROM were treated with RECOTHROM during surgery ( spinal , peripheral arterial bypass , arteriovenous graft formation , or other procedures ) . 3 The incidence of thromboembolic adverse reactions in this study was 3 % .
In other randomized , double - blind trials across a range of surgical settings ( N = 130 ; spinal surgery , hepatic resection , peripheral arterial bypass surgery , or arteriovenous graft formation for hemodialysis access ) , the safety of RECOTHROM ( n = 88 patients ) was compared to placebo ( RECOTHROM excipients reconstituted with sterile 0 . 9 % sodium chloride , USP ) ( n = 42 patients ) .
The incidence of thromboembolic adverse reactions in this study was 5 % for RECOTHROM and 12 % for placebo .
RECOTHROM Thrombin Applied with Spray Applicator RECOTHROM was applied with a spray applicator in two open - label clinical trials : a single - group trial in adult and pediatric burn patients ( N = 72 ; ≤ 16 years of age , ( n = 4 ) and ≥ 17 years of age , ( n = 68 ) ) treated with RECOTHROM applied to the wound excision site prior to autologous skin grafting4 ; and in a single - group trial in pediatric patients ( one month to 17 years of age ) undergoing synchronous burn wound excision and autologous skin grafting ( N = 30 ; ≤ 16 years of age , ( n = 26 ) ; ≥ 17 years of age , ( n = 4 ) ) . 5 In the first study , the incidence of thromboembolic adverse reactions was 1 % .
In the second study , there were no reported thromboembolic adverse reactions [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent upon the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
The absolute immunogenicity rates reported here are difficult to compare with the results from other products due to differences in assay methodology , patient populations , and other underlying factors .
The potential for development of antibodies to RECOTHROM thrombin was evaluated in multiple clinical trials and included patients with a single exposure to RECOTHROM as well as patients who were re - exposed to RECOTHROM during a subsequent surgical procedure .
Only patients with both baseline and post - treatment antibody specimens available were evaluated for the development of specific anti - RECOTHROM product antibodies , which was defined as seroconversion or a ≥ 1 . 0 titer unit ( ≥ 10 - fold ) increase in antibody levels after study treatment .
Five of 609 ( 0 . 8 % ; 95 % CI , 0 . 4 % - 2 . 8 % ) evaluable patients developed specific anti - RECOTHROM product antibodies .
None of these antibodies were found to neutralize native human thrombin .
There was no difference in anti - RECOTHROM product antibody formation incidence among patients exposed to RECOTHROM applied with absorbable gelatin sponge , USP or with spray applicator .
In a clinical trial comparing RECOTHROM to bovine thrombin ( N = 411 ; n = 398 antibody evaluable ) for the development of specific anti - product antibodies , blood samples were collected at baseline and at Day 29 in both treatment groups and were analyzed by ELISA . 1 At baseline , 1 . 5 % of RECOTHROM patients ( n = 3 / 198 ) had positive anti - product antibody titers compared with 5 % of bovine thrombin patients ( n = 10 / 200 ) .
Of these patients , none of the RECOTHROM group and eight in the bovine thrombin group exhibited ≥ 1 . 0 titer unit ( ≥ 10 - fold ) increases in anti - product antibody levels after study treatment .
At Day 29 , three of 198 ( 1 . 5 % ; 95 % CI , 0 % - 4 % ) patients in the RECOTHROM group developed specific anti - product antibodies ( one patient also developed anti - CHO host cell protein antibodies ) ; 43 of 200 patients in the bovine thrombin group ( 22 % ; 95 % CI , 16 % - 28 % ) developed specific antibodies to bovine thrombin product .
Treatment with RECOTHROM resulted in a statistically significant lower incidence of specific anti - product antibody development .
Because the study was not powered to detect a difference in clinical outcomes attributable to antibody formation , no conclusions can be drawn regarding the clinical significance of the difference in antibody formation based on the results of this study .
None of the antibodies in the RECOTHROM group neutralized native human thrombin .
Antibodies against bovine thrombin product were not tested for neutralization of native human thrombin .
In a trial of patients with a high likelihood of prior exposure to bovine thrombin , 15 . 6 % of patients ( n = 32 / 205 ) had anti - bovine thrombin product antibodies and 2 % of patients ( n = 4 / 200 ) had anti - RECOTHROM product antibodies at baseline . 2 Following treatment , none of the 200 evaluable patients ( patients for whom post - treatment specimens were available ) developed antibodies to RECOTHROM .
In a trial of patients previously exposed to RECOTHROM , 31 patients were re - exposed to RECOTHROM during a subsequent surgery . 3 None of the evaluable patients ( n = 30 ) had anti - RECOTHROM product antibodies at baseline and none developed antibodies at Day 29 .
In a trial of RECOTHROM , including 26 pediatric patients ( aged one month to 16 years ) and four patients 17 years of age , one patient without prior thrombin exposure had pre - existing anti - RECOTHROM product antibodies at baseline . 5 None of the 27 evaluable patients developed anti - RECOTHROM product antibodies at Day 29 .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data regarding RECOTHROM in pregnant women .
No animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been conducted with RECOTHROM thrombin .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of RECOTHROM in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , and the effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for RECOTHROM and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from RECOTHROM or from underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use A total of 30 pediatric patients , ages 0 to 16 years ( one month to 2 years , n = 10 ; 2 to 12 years , n = 12 ; 12 to 16 years , n = 8 ) , were treated in clinical trials with RECOTHROM thrombin using a spray applicator to burn wound excision sites prior to autologous skin grafting .
No patient experienced a thromboembolic adverse reaction .
The safety of RECOTHROM in pediatric patients greater than or equal to one month of age is supported by these data and by extrapolation of efficacy from adequate and well - controlled studies of RECOTHROM in adults .
Safety and efficacy have not been established in neonates [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of 644 patients in clinical studies of RECOTHROM thrombin , 36 % ( n = 232 / 644 ) were ≥ 65 years old and 15 % ( n = 95 / 644 ) were ≥ 75 years old .
No differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
11 DESCRIPTION RECOTHROM Thrombin topical ( Recombinant ) , is a human coagulation protein produced via recombinant DNA technology from a genetically modified CHO cell line .
RECOTHROM is identical in amino acid sequence and structurally similar to naturally occurring human thrombin .
RECOTHROM precursor is secreted to culture medium as single chain form that is proteolytically converted to a two - chain active form ( using a protein derived from snakes ) and is purified by a chromatographic process that yields a product having hemostatic activities similar to native human thrombin .
The cell line used to manufacture RECOTHROM has been tested and shown to be free of known infectious agents .
The cell culture process used in the manufacture of RECOTHROM employs no additives of human or animal origin .
The purification process includes solvent - detergent treatment and nano - filtration steps dedicated to viral clearance .
RECOTHROM is provided as a sterile , white to off - white , preservative - free , lyophilized powder in vials for reconstitution with diluent ( sterile 0 . 9 % sodium chloride , USP ) .
Reconstitution with the provided diluent , as described [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] , yields a solution with a pH of 6 . 0 containing 1000 units / mL of recombinant thrombin for topical use .
The formulated product is a clear , colorless solution upon reconstitution and contains the following excipients : histidine , mannitol , sucrose , polyethylene glycol 3350 , sodium chloride , and calcium chloride dihydrate , USP .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action RECOTHROM Thrombin topical ( Recombinant ) , is a specific human serine protease that promotes hemostasis and acts locally when applied topically to a site of bleeding .
RECOTHROM activates platelets and catalyzes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin , which are steps that are essential for blood clot formation .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In vitro cytotoxicity studies have been performed in mouse L929 fibroblast cell cultures and demonstrate a concentration - dependent effect on cell morphology .
The thrombin - induced morphological changes were similar to those seen with bovine thrombin .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology In a study in nonhuman primates , RECOTHROM thrombin was applied directly to a liver wound with an absorbable gelatin sponge , USP .
In a second study , RECOTHROM was administered subcutaneously once weekly for four weeks to nonhuman primates following repeat doses of 5405 units / m2 .
In both studies , RECOTHROM had no effect on clinical signs , serum chemistry , coagulation parameters , or histopathology ; only normal postsurgical findings were observed .
No animals developed anti - RECOTHROM product antibodies in either study .
RECOTHROM was found to be non - irritating when instilled in the eyes ( 200 units ) or applied to normal or abraded skin of rabbits ( up to 1000 units / site ) .
To evaluate RECOTHROM inhibition and clearance from the bloodstream , radiolabeled RECOTHROM was administered intravenously or subcutaneously to nonhuman primates and applied with an absorbable gelatin sponge , USP , in a rabbit hepatic wound model .
RECOTHROM did not circulate in the blood as free , active molecule , but was rapidly inactivated ( < 5 minutes ) after formation of complexes with endogenous inhibitors ( e . g . , antithrombin III ) ; these complexes were cleared by the liver .
RECOTHROM applied with an absorbable gelatin sponge , USP , was shown to decrease time to hemostasis ( TTH ) when compared to saline in a rabbit hepatic wound model and rat heminephrectomy model .
RECOTHROM also reduced TTH when directly applied in a porcine partial - thickness excisional skin - wound model as compared to saline control ( or no treatment ) .
RECOTHROM applied with a gauze sponge decreased TTH in a concentration - dependent manner in both the rabbit and rat models .
Concentrations of RECOTHROM > 1000 units / mL were no different than 1000 units / mL while the effect of RECOTHROM diluted to a concentration of 100 units / mL on TTH was indistinguishable from placebo .
The performance of RECOTHROM mixed with gelatin matrix ( FLOSEAL NT Hemostatic Matrix , 5 mL ) was compared to FLOSEAL Hemostatic Matrix , 5 mL ( human plasma - derived thrombin mixed with gelatin matrix ) in a blinded nonclinical study using a heparinized porcine liver punch model of moderate to severe bleeding .
The analysis demonstrated that the performance of RECOTHROM mixed with gelatin matrix was non - inferior to human plasma - derived thrombin mixed with gelatin matrix .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES RECOTHROM thrombin was evaluated in a randomized , double - blind comparative clinical trial to bovine thrombin .
Each thrombin was topically applied to bleeding sites with an absorbable gelatin sponge at a nominal concentration of 1000 units / mL . 1 Patients ( N = 411 ) were a heterogeneous surgical population undergoing surgery in one of four surgical settings : spinal surgery ( n = 122 , 30 % ) , hepatic resection ( n = 125 , 30 % ) , peripheral arterial bypass surgery ( n = 88 , 21 % ) , and arteriovenous graft formation for hemodialysis access ( n = 76 , 18 % ) .
Patients with prior heparin - induced thrombocytopenia were excluded .
Patient ages ranged from 21 to 89 years , gender was 53 % male and 47 % female , and the distribution by race was 68 % white , 18 % black or African American , and 14 % other .
The distribution of these characteristics was similar in both the RECOTHROM and bovine thrombin treatment groups .
The objectives of the study were to evaluate the comparative efficacy , safety , and immunogenicity of RECOTHROM and bovine thrombin in combination with an absorbable gelatin sponge as adjuncts to hemostasis in surgery .
Efficacy was evaluated by the incidence of hemostasis within 10 minutes .
Bleeding appropriate for evaluation was defined as mild to moderate bleeding , either on its own or remaining after brisk bleeding was controlled by standard surgical modalities .
Although multiple bleeding sites could be treated , only one bleeding site per patient was selected to determine effectiveness .
Table 2 summarizes the incidence of hemostasis within 10 minutes for each treatment for the 401 efficacy evaluable patients .
The incidence of hemostasis within 10 minutes was comparable for the RECOTHROM and bovine thrombin groups .
