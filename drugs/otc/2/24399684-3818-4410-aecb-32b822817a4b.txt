( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Exacerbation of Chemotherapy - Induced Neutropenia .
( 5 . 5 , 6 . 1 ) 5 . 1 Cardiomyopathy Trastuzumab products can cause left ventricular cardiac dysfunction , arrhythmias , hypertension , disabling cardiac failure , cardiomyopathy , and cardiac death [ see Boxed Warning ] .
Trastuzumab products can also cause asymptomatic decline in left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) .
There is a 4 to 6 fold increase in the incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction among patients receiving trastuzumab products as a single agent or in combination therapy compared with those not receiving trastuzumab products .
The highest absolute incidence occurs when a trastuzumab product is administered with an anthracycline .
Withhold TRAZIMERA for ≥ 16 % absolute decrease in LVEF from pre - treatment values or an LVEF value below institutional limits of normal and ≥ 10 % absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
The safety of continuation or resumption of TRAZIMERA in patients with trastuzumab product - induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied .
Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping TRAZIMERA may also be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Cardiac Monitoring Conduct thorough cardiac assessment , including history , physical examination , and determination of LVEF by echocardiogram or MUGA scan .
The following schedule is recommended : • Baseline LVEF measurement immediately prior to initiation of TRAZIMERA • LVEF measurements every 3 months during and upon completion of TRAZIMERA • Repeat LVEF measurement at 4 week intervals if TRAZIMERA is withheld for significant left ventricular cardiac dysfunction [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] • LVEF measurements every 6 months for at least 2 years following completion of TRAZIMERA as a component of adjuvant therapy .
In Study 1 , 15 % ( 158 / 1031 ) of patients discontinued trastuzumab due to clinical evidence of myocardial dysfunction or significant decline in LVEF after a median follow - up duration of 8 . 7 years in the AC - TH ( anthracycline , cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel , and trastuzumab ) arm .
In Study 3 ( one - year trastuzumab treatment ) , the number of patients who discontinued trastuzumab due to cardiac toxicity at 12 . 6 months median duration of follow - up was 2 . 6 % ( 44 / 1678 ) .
In Study 4 , a total of 2 . 9 % ( 31 / 1056 ) of patients in the TCH ( docetaxel , carboplatin , trastuzumab ) arm ( 1 . 5 % during the chemotherapy phase and 1 . 4 % during the monotherapy phase ) and 5 . 7 % ( 61 / 1068 ) of patients in the AC - TH arm ( 1 . 5 % during the chemotherapy phase and 4 . 2 % during the monotherapy phase ) discontinued trastuzumab due to cardiac toxicity .
Among 64 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy ( Studies 1 and 2 ) who developed congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , one patient died of cardiomyopathy , one patient died suddenly without documented etiology , and 33 patients were receiving cardiac medication at last follow - up .
Approximately 24 % of the surviving patients had recovery to a normal LVEF ( defined as ≥ 50 % ) and no symptoms on continuing medical management at the time of last follow - up .
Incidence of congestive heart failure is presented in Table 1 .
The safety of continuation or resumption of TRAZIMERA in patients with trastuzumab product - induced left ventricular cardiac dysfunction has not been studied .

In Study 4 , the incidence of NCI - CTC Grade 3 / 4 cardiac ischemia / infarction was higher in the trastuzumab containing regimens ( AC - TH : 0 . 3 % ( 3 / 1068 ) and TCH : 0 . 2 % ( 2 / 1056 ) ) as compared to none in AC - T .
5 . 2 Infusion Reactions Infusion reactions consist of a symptom complex characterized by fever and chills , and on occasion included nausea , vomiting , pain ( in some cases at tumor sites ) , headache , dizziness , dyspnea , hypotension , rash , and asthenia [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In post - marketing reports , serious and fatal infusion reactions have been reported .
Severe reactions , which include bronchospasm , anaphylaxis , angioedema , hypoxia , and severe hypotension , were usually reported during or immediately following the initial infusion .
However , the onset and clinical course were variable , including progressive worsening , initial improvement followed by clinical deterioration , or delayed post - infusion events with rapid clinical deterioration .
For fatal events , death occurred within hours to days following a serious infusion reaction .
Interrupt TRAZIMERA infusion in all patients experiencing dyspnea , clinically significant hypotension , and intervention of medical therapy administered ( which may include epinephrine , corticosteroids , diphenhydramine , bronchodilators , and oxygen ) .
Patients should be evaluated and carefully monitored until complete resolution of signs and symptoms .
Permanent discontinuation should be strongly considered in all patients with severe infusion reactions .
There are no data regarding the most appropriate method of identification of patients who may safely be retreated with trastuzumab products after experiencing a severe infusion reaction .
Prior to resumption of trastuzumab infusion , the majority of patients who experienced a severe infusion reaction were pre - medicated with antihistamines and / or corticosteroids .
While some patients tolerated trastuzumab infusions , others had recurrent severe infusion reactions despite pre - medications .
5 . 3 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
In post - marketing reports , use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and oligohydramnios sequence manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia , skeletal abnormalities , and neonatal death .
Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of TRAZIMERA .
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to TRAZIMERA during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 7 months following the last dose of TRAZIMERA [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 4 Pulmonary Toxicity Trastuzumab product use can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity .
Pulmonary toxicity includes dyspnea , interstitial pneumonitis , pulmonary infiltrates , pleural effusions , non - cardiogenic pulmonary edema , pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia , acute respiratory distress syndrome , and pulmonary fibrosis .
Such events can occur as sequelae of infusion reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or with extensive tumor involvement of the lungs , resulting in dyspnea at rest , appear to have more severe toxicity .
5 . 5 Exacerbation of Chemotherapy - Induced Neutropenia In randomized , controlled clinical trials , the per - patient incidences of NCI - CTC Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and of febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving trastuzumab in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy as compared to those who received chemotherapy alone .
The incidence of septic death was similar among patients who received trastuzumab and those who did not [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label : • Cardiomyopathy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Infusion Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Embryo - Fetal Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Pulmonary Toxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Exacerbation of Chemotherapy - Induced Neutropenia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] The most common adverse reactions in patients receiving trastuzumab products in the adjuvant and metastatic breast cancer setting are fever , nausea , vomiting , infusion reactions , diarrhea , infections , increased cough , headache , fatigue , dyspnea , rash , neutropenia , anemia , and myalgia .

Cardiomyopathy Serial measurement of cardiac function ( LVEF ) was obtained in clinical trials in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer .
In Study 3 , the median duration of follow - up was 12 . 6 months ( 12 . 4 months in the observation arm ; 12 . 6 months in the 1 - year trastuzumab arm ) ; and in Studies 1 and 2 , 7 . 9 years in the AC - T arm , 8 . 3 years in the AC - TH arm .
In Studies 1 and 2 , 6 % of all randomized patients with post - AC LVEF evaluation were not permitted to initiate trastuzumab following completion of AC chemotherapy due to cardiac dysfunction ( LVEF < LLN or ≥ 16 point decline in LVEF from baseline to end of AC ) .
Following initiation of trastuzumab therapy , the incidence of new - onset dose - limiting myocardial dysfunction was higher among patients receiving trastuzumab and paclitaxel as compared to those receiving paclitaxel alone in Studies 1 and 2 , and in patients receiving one - year trastuzumab monotherapy compared to observation in Study 3 ( see Table 6 , Figures 1 and 2 ) .
The per - patient incidence of new - onset cardiac dysfunction , as measured by LVEF , remained similar when compared to the analysis performed at a median follow - up of 2 . 0 years in the AC - TH arm .
This analysis also showed evidence of reversibility of left ventricular dysfunction , with 64 . 5 % of patients who experienced symptomatic CHF in the AC - TH group being asymptomatic at latest follow - up , and 90 . 3 % having full or partial LVEF recovery .

The incidence of treatment emergent congestive heart failure among patients in the metastatic breast cancer trials was classified for severity using the New York Heart Association classification system ( I – IV , where IV is the most severe level of cardiac failure ) ( see Table 2 ) .
In the metastatic breast cancer trials , the probability of cardiac dysfunction was highest in patients who received trastuzumab concurrently with anthracyclines .
In Study 7 , 5 . 0 % of patients in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy arm compared to 1 . 1 % of patients in the chemotherapy alone arm had LVEF value below 50 % with a ≥ 10 % absolute decrease in LVEF from pretreatment values .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Infusion Reactions During the first infusion with trastuzumab , the symptoms most commonly reported were chills and fever , occurring in approximately 40 % of patients in clinical trials .
Symptoms were treated with acetaminophen , diphenhydramine , and meperidine ( with or without reduction in the rate of trastuzumab infusion ) ; permanent discontinuation of trastuzumab for infusion reactions was required in < 1 % of patients .
Other signs and / or symptoms may include nausea , vomiting , pain ( in some cases at tumor sites ) , rigors , headache , dizziness , dyspnea , hypotension , elevated blood pressure , rash , and asthenia .
Infusion reactions occurred in 21 % and 35 % of patients , and were severe in 1 . 4 % and 9 % of patients , on second or subsequent trastuzumab infusions administered as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy , respectively .
In the post - marketing setting , severe infusion reactions , including hypersensitivity , anaphylaxis , and angioedema have been reported .

Complications included volume overload and congestive heart failure .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is potential for immunogenicity .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors , including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other trastuzumab products may be misleading .
Among 903 women with metastatic breast cancer , human anti - human antibody ( HAHA ) to trastuzumab was detected in one patient using an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) .
This patient did not experience an allergic reaction .
Samples for assessment of HAHA were not collected in studies of adjuvant breast cancer .
6 . 3 Post - Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of trastuzumab .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Infusion reaction [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Oligohydramnios or oligohydramnios sequence , including pulmonary hypoplasia , skeletal abnormalities , and neonatal death [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Glomerulopathy [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] • Immune thrombocytopenia • Tumor lysis syndrome ( TLS ) : Cases of possible TLS have been reported in patients treated with trastuzumab products .
Patients with significant tumor burden ( e . g . bulky metastases ) may be at a higher risk .
Patients could present with hyperuricemia , hyperphosphatemia , and acute renal failure which may represent possible TLS .
Providers should consider additional monitoring and / or treatment as clinically indicated .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping trastuzumab products may be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction because of trastuzumab ' s long washout period based on population PK analysis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
If possible , physicians should avoid anthracycline - based therapy for up to 7 months after stopping trastuzumab products .
If anthracyclines are used , the patient ' s cardiac function should be monitored carefully .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : Verify the pregnancy status of females prior to initiation of TRAZIMERA ( 8 . 3 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Trastuzumab products can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
In post - marketing reports , use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence , manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia , skeletal abnormalities , and neonatal death ( see Data ) .
Apprise the patient of the potential risks to a fetus .
There are clinical considerations if a trastuzumab product is used in a pregnant woman or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of a trastuzumab product ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Fetal / Neonatal Adverse Reactions Monitor women who received TRAZIMERA during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios .
If oligohydramnios occurs , perform fetal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care .
Data Human Data In post - marketing reports , use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence , manifesting in the fetus as pulmonary hypoplasia , skeletal abnormalities and neonatal death .
These case reports described oligohydramnios in pregnant women who received trastuzumab either alone or in combination with chemotherapy .
In some case reports , amniotic fluid index increased after trastuzumab was stopped .
In one case , trastuzumab therapy resumed after amniotic index improved , and oligohydramnios recurred .
Animal Data In studies where trastuzumab was administered to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 25 mg / kg given twice weekly ( up to 25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg / kg ) , trastuzumab crossed the placental barrier during the early ( Gestation Days 20 to 50 ) and late ( Gestation Days 120 to 150 ) phases of gestation .
The resulting concentrations of trastuzumab in fetal serum and amniotic fluid were approximately 33 % and 25 % , respectively , of those present in the maternal serum but were not associated with adverse developmental effects .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of trastuzumab products in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Published data suggest human IgG is present in human milk but does not enter the neonatal and infant circulation in substantial amounts .
Trastuzumab was present in the milk of lactating cynomolgus monkeys but not associated with neonatal toxicity ( see Data ) .
Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother ' s clinical need for TRAZIMERA treatment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from TRAZIMERA or from the underlying maternal condition .
This consideration should also take into account the trastuzumab product wash out period of 7 months [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Data In lactating cynomolgus monkeys , trastuzumab was present in breast milk at about 0 . 3 % of maternal serum concentrations after pre - ( beginning Gestation Day 120 ) and post - partum ( through Post - partum Day 28 ) doses of 25 mg / kg administered twice weekly ( 25 times the recommended weekly human dose of 2 mg / kg of trastuzumab products ) .
Infant monkeys with detectable serum levels of trastuzumab did not exhibit any adverse effects on growth or development from birth to 1 month of age .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of TRAZIMERA .
Contraception Females Trastuzumab products can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered during pregnancy .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TRAZIMERA and for 7 months following the last dose of TRAZIMERA [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of trastuzumab products in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Trastuzumab has been administered to 386 patients who were 65 years of age or over ( 253 in the adjuvant treatment and 133 in metastatic breast cancer treatment settings ) .
The risk of cardiac dysfunction was increased in geriatric patients as compared to younger patients in both those receiving treatment for metastatic disease in Studies 5 and 6 , or adjuvant therapy in Studies 1 and 2 .
Limitations in data collection and differences in study design of the 4 studies of trastuzumab in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer preclude a determination of whether the toxicity profile of trastuzumab in older patients is different from younger patients .
The reported clinical experience is not adequate to determine whether the efficacy improvements ( ORR , TTP , OS , DFS ) of trastuzumab treatment in older patients is different from that observed in patients < 65 years of age for metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment .
In Study 7 ( metastatic gastric cancer ) , of the 294 patients treated with trastuzumab , 108 ( 37 % ) were 65 years of age or older , while 13 ( 4 . 4 % ) were 75 and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no experience with overdosage in human clinical trials .
Single doses higher than 8 mg / kg have not been tested .
11 DESCRIPTION Trastuzumab - qyyp is a humanized IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein , HER2 .
Trastuzumab - qyyp is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a mammalian cell ( Chinese Hamster Ovary ) culture .
TRAZIMERA ( trastuzumab - qyyp ) for injection is a sterile , white , preservative - free lyophilized powder with a cake - like appearance , for intravenous administration .
Each multiple - dose vial of TRAZIMERA delivers 420 mg trastuzumab - qyyp , 7 . 9 mg L - histidine , 9 . 5 mg L - histidine HCl monohydrate , 1 . 7 mg polysorbate 20 , and 386 mg sucrose .
Reconstitution with 20 mL of the appropriate diluent ( BWFI or SWFI ) yields a solution containing 21 mg / mL trastuzumab - qyyp that delivers 20 mL ( 420 mg trastuzumab - qyyp ) , at a pH of approximately 6 .
If TRAZIMERA is reconstituted with SWFI without preservative , the reconstituted solution is considered single - dose .
Each single - dose vial of TRAZIMERA delivers 150 mg trastuzumab - qyyp , 2 . 8 mg L - histidine , 3 . 4 mg L - histidine HCl monohydrate , 0 . 6 mg polysorbate 20 , and 138 mg sucrose .
Reconstitution with 7 . 4 mL of SWFI yields a solution containing 21 mg / mL trastuzumab - qyyp that delivers 7 . 15 mL ( 150 mg trastuzumab - qyyp ) , at a pH of approximately 6 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The HER2 ( or c - erbB2 ) proto - oncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein of 185 kDa , which is structurally related to the epidermal growth factor receptor .
Trastuzumab products have been shown , in both in vitro assays and in animals , to inhibit the proliferation of human tumor cells that overexpress HER2 .
Trastuzumab products are mediators of antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) .
In vitro , trastuzumab product - mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2 .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effects of trastuzumab on electrocardiographic ( ECG ) endpoints , including QTc interval duration , were evaluated in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors .
Trastuzumab had no clinically relevant effect on the QTc interval duration and there was no apparent relationship between serum trastuzumab concentrations and change in QTcF interval duration in patients with HER2 positive solid tumors .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab were evaluated in a pooled population pharmacokinetic ( PK ) model analysis of 1 , 582 subjects with primarily breast cancer and metastatic gastric cancer ( MGC ) receiving intravenous trastuzumab .
Total trastuzumab clearance increases with decreasing concentrations due to parallel linear and non - linear elimination pathways .
Although the average trastuzumab exposure was higher following the first cycle in breast cancer patients receiving the three - weekly schedule compared to the weekly schedule of trastuzumab , the average steady - state exposure was essentially the same at both dosages .
The average trastuzumab exposure following the first cycle and at steady state as well as the time to steady state was higher in breast cancer patients compared to MGC patients at the same dosage ; however , the reason for this exposure difference is unknown .
Additional predicted trastuzumab exposure and PK parameters following the first trastuzumab cycle and at steady state exposure are described in Tables 7 and 8 , respectively .
Population PK based simulations indicate that following discontinuation of trastuzumab , concentrations in at least 95 % of breast cancer patients and MGC patients will decrease to approximately 3 % of the population predicted steady - state trough serum concentration ( approximately 97 % washout ) by 7 months [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .

The pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab products in patients with severe renal impairment , end - stage renal disease with or without hemodialysis , or hepatic impairment are unknown .
Drug Interaction Studies There have been no formal drug interaction studies performed with trastuzumab products in humans .
Clinically significant interactions between trastuzumab and concomitant medications used in clinical trials have not been observed .
Paclitaxel and Doxorubicin Concentrations of paclitaxel and doxorubicin and their major metabolites ( i . e . , 6 - α hydroxyl - paclitaxel [ POH ] , and doxorubicinol [ DOL ] , respectively ) were not altered in the presence of trastuzumab when used as combination therapy in clinical trials .
Trastuzumab concentrations were not altered as part of this combination therapy .
Docetaxel and Carboplatin When trastuzumab was administered in combination with docetaxel or carboplatin , neither the plasma concentrations of docetaxel or carboplatin nor the plasma concentrations of trastuzumab were altered .
Cisplatin and Capecitabine In a drug interaction substudy conducted in patients in Study 7 , the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin , capecitabine and their metabolites were not altered when administered in combination with trastuzumab .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Trastuzumab products have not been tested for carcinogenic potential .
No evidence of mutagenic activity was observed when trastuzumab was tested in the standard Ames bacterial and human peripheral blood lymphocyte mutagenicity assays at concentrations of up to 5000 mcg / mL .
In an in vivo micronucleus assay , no evidence of chromosomal damage to mouse bone marrow cells was observed following bolus intravenous doses of up to 118 mg / kg of trastuzumab .
A fertility study was conducted in female cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 25 times the weekly recommended human dose of 2 mg / kg of trastuzumab and has revealed no evidence of impaired fertility , as measured by menstrual cycle duration and female sex hormone levels .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Adjuvant Breast Cancer The safety and efficacy of trastuzumab in women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for HER2 overexpressing breast cancer were evaluated in an integrated analysis of two randomized , open - label , clinical trials ( Studies 1 and 2 ) with a total of 4063 women at the protocol - specified final overall survival analysis , a third randomized , open - label , clinical trial ( Study 3 ) with a total of 3386 women at definitive Disease - Free Survival analysis for one - year trastuzumab treatment versus observation , and a fourth randomized , open - label clinical trial with a total of 3222 patients ( Study 4 ) .
Studies 1 and 2 In Studies 1 and 2 , breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 overexpression ( 3 + by IHC ) or gene amplification ( by FISH ) .
HER2 testing was verified by a central laboratory prior to randomization ( Study 2 ) or was required to be performed at a reference laboratory ( Study 1 ) .
Patients with a history of active cardiac disease based on symptoms , abnormal electrocardiographic , radiologic , or left ventricular ejection fraction findings or uncontrolled hypertension ( diastolic > 100 mm Hg or systolic > 200 mm Hg ) were not eligible .
Patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel ( AC → paclitaxel ) alone or paclitaxel plus trastuzumab ( AC → paclitaxel + trastuzumab ) .
In both trials , patients received four 21 - day cycles of doxorubicin 60 mg / m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg / m2 .
Paclitaxel was administered either weekly ( 80 mg / m2 ) or every 3 weeks ( 175 mg / m2 ) for a total of 12 weeks in Study 1 ; paclitaxel was administered only by the weekly schedule in Study 2 .
Trastuzumab was administered at 4 mg / kg on the day of initiation of paclitaxel and then at a dose of 2 mg / kg weekly for a total of 52 weeks .
Trastuzumab treatment was permanently discontinued in patients who developed congestive heart failure , or persistent / recurrent LVEF decline [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Radiation therapy , if administered , was initiated after the completion of chemotherapy .
Patients with ER + and / or PR + tumors received hormonal therapy .
The primary endpoint of the combined efficacy analysis was Disease - Free Survival ( DFS ) , defined as the time from randomization to recurrence , occurrence of contralateral breast cancer , other second primary cancer , or death .
The secondary endpoint was overall survival ( OS ) .
A total of 3752 patients were included in the joint efficacy analysis of the primary endpoint of DFS following a median follow - up of 2 . 0 years in the AC → paclitaxel + trastuzumab arm .
The pre - planned final OS analysis from the joint analysis included 4063 patients and was performed when 707 deaths had occurred after a median follow - up of 8 . 3 years in the AC → paclitaxel + trastuzumab arm .
The data from both arms in Study 1 and two of the three study arms in Study 2 were pooled for efficacy analyses .
The patients included in the primary DFS analysis had a median age of 49 years ( range , 22 to 80 years ; 6 % > 65 years ) , 84 % were white , 7 % black , 4 % Hispanic , and 4 % Asian / Pacific Islander .
Disease characteristics included 90 % infiltrating ductal histology , 38 % T1 , 91 % nodal involvement , 27 % intermediate and 66 % high grade pathology , and 53 % ER + and / or PR + tumors .
Similar demographic and baseline characteristics were reported for the efficacy evaluable population , after 8 . 3 years of median follow - up in the AC → paclitaxel + trastuzumab arm .
Study 3 In Study 3 , breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 overexpression ( 3 + by IHC ) or gene amplification ( by FISH ) as determined at a central laboratory .
Patients with node - negative disease were required to have ≥ T1c primary tumor .
Patients with a history of congestive heart failure or LVEF < 55 % , uncontrolled arrhythmias , angina requiring medication , clinically significant valvular heart disease , evidence of transmural infarction on ECG , poorly controlled hypertension ( systolic > 180 mm Hg or diastolic > 100 mm Hg ) were not eligible .
Study 3 was designed to compare one and two years of three - weekly trastuzumab treatment versus observation in patients with HER2 positive EBC following surgery , established chemotherapy and radiotherapy ( if applicable ) .
Patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) upon completion of definitive surgery , and at least four cycles of chemotherapy to receive no additional treatment , or one year of trastuzumab treatment or two years of trastuzumab treatment .
Patients undergoing a lumpectomy had also completed standard radiotherapy .
Patients with ER + and / or PgR + disease received systemic adjuvant hormonal therapy at investigator discretion .
Trastuzumab was administered with an initial dose of 8 mg / kg followed by subsequent doses of 6 mg / kg once every three weeks .
The main outcome measure was Disease - Free Survival ( DFS ) , defined as in Studies 1 and 2 .
A protocol - specified interim efficacy analysis comparing one - year trastuzumab treatment to observation was performed at a median follow - up duration of 12 . 6 months in the trastuzumab arm and formed the basis for the definitive DFS results from this study .
Among the 3386 patients randomized to the observation ( n = 1693 ) and trastuzumab one - year ( n = 1693 ) treatment arms , the median age was 49 years ( range 21 to 80 ) , 83 % were Caucasian , and 13 % were Asian .
Disease characteristics : 94 % infiltrating ductal carcinoma , 50 % ER + and / or PgR + , 57 % node positive , 32 % node negative , and in 11 % of patients , nodal status was not assessable due to prior neo - adjuvant chemotherapy .
Ninety - six percent ( 1055 / 1098 ) of patients with node - negative disease had high - risk features : among the 1098 patients with node - negative disease , 49 % ( 543 ) were ER − and PgR − , and 47 % ( 512 ) were ER and / or PgR + and had at least one of the following high - risk features : pathological tumor size greater than 2 cm , Grade 2 to 3 , or age < 35 years .
Prior to randomization , 94 % of patients had received anthracycline - based chemotherapy regimens .
After the definitive DFS results comparing observation to one - year trastuzumab treatment were disclosed , a prospectively planned analysis that included comparison of one year versus two years of trastuzumab treatment at a median follow - up duration of 8 years was performed .
Based on this analysis , extending trastuzumab treatment for a duration of two years did not show additional benefit over treatment for one year [ Hazard Ratios of two - years trastuzumab versus one - year trastuzumab treatment in the intent to treat ( ITT ) population for Disease - Free Survival ( DFS ) = 0 . 99 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 87 , 1 . 13 ) , p - value = 0 . 90 and Overall Survival ( OS ) = 0 . 98 ( 0 . 83 , 1 . 15 ) ; p - value = 0 . 78 ] .
Study 4 In Study 4 , breast tumor specimens were required to show HER2 gene amplification ( FISH + only ) as determined at a central laboratory .
Patients were required to have either node - positive disease , or node - negative disease with at least one of the following high - risk features : ER / PR - negative , tumor size > 2 cm , age < 35 years , or histologic and / or nuclear Grade 2 or 3 .
Patients with a history of CHF , myocardial infarction , Grade 3 or 4 cardiac arrhythmia , angina requiring medication , clinically significant valvular heart disease , poorly controlled hypertension ( diastolic > 100 mm Hg ) , any T4 or N2 or known N3 or M1 breast cancer were not eligible .
Patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) to receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel ( AC - T ) , doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel plus trastuzumab ( AC - TH ) , or docetaxel and carboplatin plus trastuzumab ( TCH ) .
In both the AC - T and AC - TH arms , doxorubicin 60 mg / m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg / m2 were administered every 3 weeks for four cycles ; docetaxel 100 mg / m2 was administered every 3 weeks for four cycles .
In the TCH arm , docetaxel 75 mg / m2 and carboplatin ( at a target AUC of 6 mg / mL / min as a 30 - to 60 - minute infusion ) were administered every 3 weeks for six cycles .
Trastuzumab was administered weekly ( initial dose of 4 mg / kg followed by weekly dose of 2 mg / kg ) concurrently with either T or TC , and then every 3 weeks ( 6 mg / kg ) as monotherapy for a total of 52 weeks .
Radiation therapy , if administered , was initiated after completion of chemotherapy .
Patients with ER + and / or PR + tumors received hormonal therapy .
Disease - Free Survival ( DFS ) was the main outcome measure .
Among the 3222 patients randomized , the median age was 49 ( range 22 to 74 years ; 6 % ≥ 65 years ) .
Disease characteristics included 54 % ER + and / or PR + and 71 % node positive .
Prior to randomization , all patients underwent primary surgery for breast cancer .
The results for DFS for the integrated analysis of Studies 1 and 2 , Study 3 , and Study 4 and OS results for the integrated analysis of Studies 1 and 2 , and Study 3 are presented in Table 9 .
For Studies 1 and 2 , the duration of DFS following a median follow - up of 2 . 0 years in the AC → TH arm is presented in Figure 4 , and the duration of OS after a median follow - up of 8 . 3 years in the AC → TH arm is presented in Figure 5 .
The duration of DFS for Study 4 is presented in Figure 6 .
Across all four studies , at the time of definitive DFS analysis , there were insufficient numbers of patients within each of the following subgroups to determine if the treatment effect was different from that of the overall patient population : patients with low tumor grade , patients within specific ethnic / racial subgroups ( Black , Hispanic , Asian / Pacific Islander patients ) , and patients > 65 years of age .
For Studies 1 and 2 , the OS hazard ratio was 0 . 64 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 55 , 0 . 74 ) .
At 8 . 3 years of median follow - up [ AC → TH ] , the survival rate was estimated to be 86 . 9 % in the AC → TH arm and 79 . 4 % in the AC → T arm .
The final OS analysis results from Studies 1 and 2 indicate that OS benefit by age , hormone receptor status , number of positive lymph nodes , tumor size and grade , and surgery / radiation therapy was consistent with the treatment effect in the overall population .
In patients ≤ 50 years of age ( n = 2197 ) , the OS hazard ratio was 0 . 65 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 52 , 0 . 81 ) and in patients > 50 years of age ( n = 1866 ) , the OS hazard ratio was 0 . 63 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 51 , 0 . 78 ) .
In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor - positive disease ( ER - positive and / or PR - positive ) ( n = 2223 ) , the hazard ratio for OS was 0 . 63 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 51 , 0 . 78 ) .
In the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor - negative disease ( ER - negative and PR - negative ) ( n = 1830 ) , the hazard ratio for OS was 0 . 64 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 52 , 0 . 80 ) .
In the subgroup of patients with tumor size ≤ 2 cm ( n = 1604 ) , the hazard ratio for OS was 0 . 52 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 39 , 0 . 71 ) .
In the subgroup of patients with tumor size > 2 cm ( n = 2448 ) , the hazard ratio for OS was 0 . 67 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 56 , 0 . 80 ) .

The results are shown in Table 10 .
The number of events in Study 2 was small with the exception of the IHC 3 + / FISH + subgroup , which constituted 81 % of those with data .
Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn regarding efficacy within other subgroups due to the small number of events .
The number of events in Study 3 was adequate to demonstrate significant effects on DFS in the IHC 3 + / FISH unknown and the FISH + / IHC unknown subgroups .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Metastatic Breast Cancer The safety and efficacy of trastuzumab in treatment of women with metastatic breast cancer were studied in a randomized , controlled clinical trial in combination with chemotherapy ( Study 5 , n = 469 patients ) and an open - label single agent clinical trial ( Study 6 , n = 222 patients ) .
Both trials studied patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein .
Patients were eligible if they had 2 or 3 levels of overexpression ( based on a 0 to 3 scale ) by immunohistochemical assessment of tumor tissue performed by a central testing lab .
Previously Untreated Metastatic Breast Cancer ( Study 5 ) Study 5 was a multicenter , randomized , open - label clinical trial conducted in 469 women with metastatic breast cancer who had not been previously treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease .
Tumor specimens were tested by IHC ( Clinical Trial Assay , CTA ) and scored as 0 , 1 + , 2 + , or 3 + , with 3 + indicating the strongest positivity .
Only patients with 2 + or 3 + positive tumors were eligible ( about 33 % of those screened ) .
Patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone or in combination with trastuzumab given intravenously as a 4 mg / kg loading dose followed by weekly doses of trastuzumab at 2 mg / kg .
For those who had received prior anthracycline therapy in the adjuvant setting , chemotherapy consisted of paclitaxel ( 175 mg / m2 over 3 hours every 21 days for at least six cycles ) ; for all other patients , chemotherapy consisted of anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide ( AC : doxorubicin 60 mg / m2 or epirubicin 75 mg / m2 plus 600 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide every 21 days for six cycles ) .
Sixty - five percent of patients randomized to receive chemotherapy alone in this study received trastuzumab at the time of disease progression as part of a separate extension study .
Based upon the determination by an independent response evaluation committee , the patients randomized to trastuzumab and chemotherapy experienced a significantly longer median time to disease progression , a higher overall response rate ( ORR ) , and a longer median duration of response as compared with patients randomized to chemotherapy alone .
Patients randomized to trastuzumab and chemotherapy also had a longer median survival ( see Table 11 ) .
These treatment effects were observed both in patients who received trastuzumab plus paclitaxel and in those who received trastuzumab plus AC ; however the magnitude of the effects was greater in the paclitaxel subgroup .

[ 2 ] FISH testing results were available for 451 of the 469 patients enrolled on study .
Previously Treated Metastatic Breast Cancer ( Study 6 ) Trastuzumab was studied as a single agent in a multicenter , open - label , single - arm clinical trial ( Study 6 ) in patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who had relapsed following one or two prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease .
Of 222 patients enrolled , 66 % had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy , 68 % had received two prior chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease , and 25 % had received prior myeloablative treatment with hematopoietic rescue .
Patients were treated with a loading dose of 4 mg / kg IV followed by weekly doses of trastuzumab at 2 mg / kg IV .
The ORR ( complete response + partial response ) , as determined by an independent Response Evaluation Committee , was 14 % , with a 2 % complete response rate and a 12 % partial response rate .
Complete responses were observed only in patients with disease limited to skin and lymph nodes .
The overall response rate in patients whose tumors tested as CTA 3 + was 18 % while in those that tested as CTA 2 + , it was 6 % .
14 . 3 Metastatic Gastric Cancer The safety and efficacy of trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine ( capecitabine or 5 - fluorouracil ) were studied in patients previously untreated for metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma ( Study 7 ) .
In this open - label , multi - center trial , 594 patients were randomized 1 : 1 to trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine ( FC + H ) or chemotherapy alone ( FC ) .
Randomization was stratified by extent of disease ( metastatic vs . locally advanced ) , primary site ( gastric vs . gastroesophageal junction ) , tumor measurability ( yes vs . no ) , ECOG performance status ( 0 , 1 vs . 2 ) , and fluoropyrimidine ( capecitabine vs . 5 - fluorouracil ) .
All patients were either HER2 gene amplified ( FISH + ) or HER2 overexpressing ( IHC 3 + ) .
Patients were also required to have adequate cardiac function ( e . g . , LVEF > 50 % ) .
On the trastuzumab - containing arm , trastuzumab was administered as an IV infusion at an initial dose of 8 mg / kg followed by 6 mg / kg every 3 weeks until disease progression .
On both study arms cisplatin was administered at a dose of 80 mg / m2 Day 1 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles as a 2 hour IV infusion .
On both study arms , capecitabine was administered at 1000 mg / m2 dose orally twice daily ( total daily dose 2000 mg / m2 ) for 14 days of each 21 day cycle for 6 cycles .
Alternatively , continuous intravenous infusion ( CIV ) 5 - fluorouracil was administered at a dose of 800 mg / m2 / day from Day 1 through Day 5 every three weeks for 6 cycles .
The median age of the study population was 60 years ( range : 21 to 83 ) ; 76 % were male ; 53 % were Asian , 38 % Caucasian , 5 % Hispanic , 5 % other racial / ethnic groups ; 91 % had ECOG PS of 0 or 1 ; 82 % had primary gastric cancer and 18 % had primary gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma .
Of these patients , 23 % had undergone prior gastrectomy , 7 % had received prior neoadjuvant and / or adjuvant therapy , and 2 % had received prior radiotherapy .
The main outcome measure of Study 7 was overall survival ( OS ) , analyzed by the unstratified log - rank test .
The final OS analysis based on 351 deaths was statistically significant ( nominal significance level of 0 . 0193 ) .
An updated OS analysis was conducted at one year after the final analysis .
The efficacy results of both the final and the updated analyses are summarized in Table 13 and Figure 7 .
