Description Sensipar ® ( cinacalcet ) is a calcimimetic agent that increases the sensitivity of the calcium - sensing receptor to activation by extracellular calcium .
Its empirical formula is C22H22F3N • HCl with a molecular weight of 393 . 9 g / mol ( hydrochloride salt ) and 357 . 4 g / mol ( free base ) .
It has one chiral center having an R - absolute configuration .
The R - enantiomer is the more potent enantiomer and has been shown to be responsible for pharmacodynamic activity .
Cinacalcet is a white to off - white , crystalline solid that is soluble in methanol or 95 % ethanol and slightly soluble in water .
Sensipar ® tablets are formulated as light - green , film - coated , oval - shaped tablets for oral administration in strengths of 30 mg , 60 mg , and 90 mg of cinacalcet as the free base equivalent ( 33 mg , 66 mg , and 99 mg as the hydrochloride salt , respectively ) .
Cinacalcet is described chemically as N - [ 1 - ( R ) - ( - ) - ( 1 - naphthyl ) ethyl ] - 3 - [ 3 - ( trifluoromethyl ) phenyl ] - 1 - aminopropane hydrochloride and has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Inactive Ingredients : Sensipar ® tablets are comprised of the active ingredient , and the following inactive ingredients : pre - gelatinized starch , microcrystalline cellulose , povidone , crospovidone , colloidal silicon dioxide , and magnesium stearate .
Tablets are coated with color ( Opadry ® II green ) , clear film - coat ( Opadry ® clear ) and carnauba wax .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Secondary hyperparathyroidism ( HPT ) in patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) is a progressive disease , associated with increases in parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) levels and derangements in calcium and phosphorus metabolism .
Increased PTH stimulates osteoclastic activity resulting in cortical bone resorption and marrow fibrosis .
The goals of treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism are to lower levels of PTH , calcium , and phosphorus in the blood , in order to prevent progressive bone disease and the systemic consequences of disordered mineral metabolism .
In CKD patients on dialysis with uncontrolled secondary HPT , reductions in PTH are associated with a favorable impact on bone - specific alkaline phosphatase ( BALP ) , bone turnover and bone fibrosis .
The calcium - sensing receptor on the surface of the chief cell of the parathyroid gland is the principal regulator of PTH secretion .
Sensipar ® directly lowers PTH levels by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium - sensing receptor to extracellular calcium .
The reduction in PTH is associated with a concomitant decrease in serum calcium levels .
Pharmacokinetics Absorption and Distribution : After oral administration of cinacalcet , maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) is achieved in approximately 2 to 6 hours .
A food - effect study in healthy volunteers indicated that the Cmax and area under the curve ( AUC ( 0 - inf ) ) were increased 82 % and 68 % , respectively , when cinacalcet was administered with a high - fat meal compared to fasting .
Cmax and AUC ( 0 - inf ) of cinacalcet were increased 65 % and 50 % , respectively , when cinacalcet was administered with a low - fat meal compared to fasting .
After absorption , cinacalcet concentrations decline in a biphasic fashion with a terminal half - life of 30 to 40 hours .
Steady - state drug levels are achieved within 7 days .
The mean accumulation ratio is approximately 2 with once - daily oral administration .
The median accumulation ratio is approximately 2 to 5 with twice - daily oral administration .
The AUC and Cmax of cinacalcet increase proportionally over the dose range of 30 to 180 mg once daily .
The pharmacokinetic profile of cinacalcet does not change over time with once - daily dosing of 30 to 180 mg .
The volume of distribution is high ( approximately 1000 L ) , indicating extensive distribution .
Cinacalcet is approximately 93 to 97 % bound to plasma protein ( s ) .
The ratio of blood cinacalcet concentration to plasma cinacalcet concentration is 0 . 80 at a blood cinacalcet concentration of 10 ng / mL .
Metabolism and Excretion : Cinacalcet is metabolized by multiple enzymes , primarily CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 .
After administration of a 75 mg radiolabeled dose to healthy volunteers , cinacalcet was rapidly and extensively metabolized via : 1 ) oxidative N - dealkylation to hydrocinnamic acid and hydroxy - hydrocinnamic acid , which are further metabolized via β - oxidation and glycine conjugation ; the oxidative N - dealkylation process also generates metabolites that contain the naphthalene ring ; and 2 ) oxidation of the naphthalene ring on the parent drug to form dihydrodiols , which are further conjugated with glucuronic acid .
The plasma concentrations of the major circulating metabolites including the cinnamic acid derivatives and glucuronidated dihydrodiols markedly exceed parent drug concentrations .
The hydrocinnamic acid metabolite was shown to be inactive at concentrations up to 10 µM in a cell - based assay measuring calcium - receptor activation .
The glucuronide conjugates formed after cinacalcet oxidation were shown to have a potency approximately 0 . 003 times that of cinacalcet in a cell - based assay measuring a calcimimetic response .
Renal excretion of metabolites was the primary route of elimination of radioactivity .
Approximately 80 % of the dose was recovered in the urine and 15 % in the feces .
Special Populations Hepatic Insufficiency : The disposition of a 50 mg cinacalcet single dose was compared in patients with hepatic impairment and subjects with normal hepatic function .
Cinacalcet exposure , AUC ( 0 - inf ) , was comparable between healthy volunteers and patients with mild hepatic impairment .
However , in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment ( as indicated by the Child - Pugh method ) , cinacalcet exposures as defined by the AUC ( 0 - inf ) were 2 . 4 and 4 . 2 times higher , respectively , than that in normals .
The mean half - life of cinacalcet is prolonged by 33 % and 70 % in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment , respectively .
Protein binding of cinacalcet is not affected by impaired hepatic function .
See PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .
Renal Insufficiency : The pharmacokinetic profile of a 75 mg Sensipar ® single dose in patients with mild , moderate , and severe renal insufficiency , and those on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is comparable to that in healthy volunteers .
Geriatric Patients : The pharmacokinetic profile of Sensipar ® in geriatric patients ( age ≥ 65 , n = 12 ) is similar to that for patients who are < 65 years of age ( n = 268 ) .
Pediatric Patients : The pharmacokinetics of Sensipar ® have not been studied in patients < 18 years of age .
Drug Interactions An in vitro study indicates that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 , but not of CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , and CYP3A4 .
In vitro induction studies indicate that cinacalcet is not an inducer of CYP450 enzymes .
Ketoconazole : Cinacalcet AUC ( 0 - inf ) and Cmax increased 2 . 3 and 2 . 2 times , respectively , when a single 90 mg cinacalcet dose on Day 5 was administered to subjects treated with 200 mg ketoconazole twice daily for 7 days compared to 90 mg cinacalcet given alone ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Calcium Carbonate : No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when a single dose of 1500 mg calcium carbonate was coadministered with 100 mg cinacalcet .
Pantoprazole : No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when cinacalcet 90 mg was administered to subjects treated with 80 mg pantoprazole daily for 3 days .
Sevelamer HCl : No significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed when 2400 mg sevelamer HCl was coadministered with 90 mg cinacalcet tablet ( subjects subsequently received 2400 mg sevelamer HCl two more times on Day 1 and three more times on Day 2 ) .
Desipramine : The effect of cinacalcet ( 90 mg ) on the pharmacokinetics of desipramine ( 50 mg ) has been studied in healthy subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
The AUC and Cmax of desipramine increased by 3 . 6 ( 296 . 5 - 446 . 7 % ) and 1 . 75 ( 157 . 5 - 194 . 9 % ) fold , respectively , in the presence of cinacalcet .
This indicates that cinacalcet is a strong in vivo inhibitor of CYP2D6 and can increase the blood concentrations of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 .
Amitriptyline : Concurrent administration of 25 mg or 100 mg cinacalcet with 50 mg amitriptyline increased amitriptyline exposure and nortriptyline ( active metabolite ) exposure by approximately 20 % in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
Warfarin : R - and S - warfarin pharmacokinetics and warfarin pharmacodynamics were not affected in subjects treated with warfarin 25 mg who received cinacalcet 30 mg twice daily .
The lack of effect of cinacalcet on the pharmacokinetics of R - and S - warfarin and the absence of auto - induction upon multiple dosing in patients indicates that cinacalcet is not an inducer of CYP2C9 in humans .
Midazolam : There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of midazolam , a CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 substrate , in subjects receiving 90 mg cinacalcet once daily for 5 days and a single dose of 2 mg midazolam on day 5 as compared to those of subjects receiving 2 mg midazolam alone .
This suggests that cinacalcet would not affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 .
Pharmacodynamics Reduction in intact PTH ( iPTH ) levels correlated with cinacalcet concentrations in CKD patients .
The nadir in iPTH level occurs approximately 2 to 6 hours post dose , corresponding with the Cmax of cinacalcet .
After steady state is reached , serum calcium concentrations remain constant over the dosing interval in CKD patients .
CLINICAL STUDIES Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease on Dialysis Three 6 - month , multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical studies of similar design were conducted in CKD patients on dialysis .
A total of 665 patients were randomized to Sensipar ® and 471 patients to placebo .
The mean age of the patients was 54 years , 62 % were male , and 52 % Caucasian .
The average baseline iPTH level by the Nichols intact immunoradiometric assay ( IRMA ) was 712 pg / mL , with 26 % of the patients having a baseline iPTH level > 800 pg / mL .
The mean baseline Ca x P ion product was 61 mg2 / dL2 .
The average duration of dialysis prior to study enrollment was 67 months .
Ninety - six percent of patients were on hemodialysis and 4 % peritoneal dialysis .
At study entry , 66 % of the patients were receiving vitamin D sterols and 93 % were receiving phosphate binders .
Sensipar ® ( or placebo ) was initiated at a dose of 30 mg once daily and titrated every 3 or 4 weeks to a maximum dose of 180 mg once daily to achieve an iPTH of ≤ 250 pg / mL .
The dose was not increased if a patient had any of the following : iPTH < 200 pg / mL , serum calcium < 7 . 8 mg / dL , or any symptoms of hypocalcemia .
If a patient experienced symptoms of hypocalcemia or had a serum calcium < 8 . 4 mg / dL , calcium supplements and / or calcium - based phosphate binders could be increased .
If these measures were insufficient , the vitamin D dose could be increased .
Approximately 70 % of the Sensipar ® patients and 80 % of the placebo patients completed the 6 - month studies .
In the primary efficacy analysis , 40 % of Sensipar ® patients and 5 % of placebo patients achieved an iPTH ≤ 250 pg / mL ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( Table 1 , Figure 1 ) .
Secondary efficacy parameters also improved in patients treated with Sensipar ® .
These studies showed that Sensipar ® reduced PTH while lowering Ca x P , calcium and phosphorus levels ( Table 1 , Figure 2 ) .
The median dose of Sensipar ® at the completion of the studies was 90 mg .
Patients with milder disease typically required lower doses .
Similar results were observed when either the iPTH or bio - intact PTH ( biPTH ) assay was used to measure PTH levels in CKD patients on dialysis ; treatment with cinacalcet did not alter the relationship between iPTH and biPTH .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] Data are presented for patients who completed the studies ; Placebo ( N = 342 ) , Sensipar ® ( N = 439 ) .
Reductions in iPTH and Ca x P were maintained for up to 12 months of treatment .
Sensipar ® decreased iPTH and Ca x P levels regardless of disease severity ( i . e . , baseline iPTH value ) , duration of dialysis , and whether or not vitamin D sterols were administered .
Approximately 60 % of patients with mild ( iPTH ≥ 300 to ≤ 500 pg / mL ) , 41 % with moderate ( iPTH > 500 to 800 pg / mL ) , and 11 % with severe ( iPTH > 800 pg / mL ) secondary HPT achieved a mean iPTH value of 250 pg / mL .
Plasma iPTH levels were measured using the Nichols IRMA .
Parathyroid Carcinoma Ten patients with parathyroid carcinoma were enrolled in an open - label study .
The study consisted of 2 phases , a dose - titration phase and a maintenance phase .
The range of exposure was 2 to 16 weeks in the titration phase ( n = 10 ) and 16 to 48 weeks ( n = 3 ) for the maintenance phase .
Baseline mean ( SD ) serum calcium was 14 . 7 ( 1 . 8 ) mg / dL .
The range of change from baseline to last measurement was – 7 . 5 to 2 . 7 mg / dL during the titration phase and – 7 . 4 to 0 . 9 mg / dL during the maintenance phase ( Figure 3 ) .
No patients maintained a serum calcium level within the normal range .
The doses ranged from 70 mg twice daily to 90 mg four times daily for patients in the maintenance phase .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Solid lines represent individual patient data B = baseline ; T = last value in titration phase ; M = last value in maintenance phase Reference lines ( dashed ) show the normal range for serum calcium values [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sensipar ® is indicated for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease on dialysis .
Sensipar ® is indicated for the treatment of hypercalcemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Sensipar ® is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any component ( s ) of this product .
WARNINGS Seizures In three clinical studies of CKD patients on dialysis , 5 % of the patients in both the Sensipar ® and placebo groups reported a history of seizure disorder at baseline .
During the trials , seizures ( primarily generalized or tonic - clonic ) were observed in 1 . 4 % ( 9 / 656 ) of Sensipar ® - treated patients and 0 . 4 % ( 2 / 470 ) of placebo - treated patients .
Five of the nine Sensipar ® - treated patients had a history of a seizure disorder and two were receiving anti - seizure medication at the time of their seizure .
Both placebo - treated patients had a history of seizure disorder and were receiving anti - seizure medication at the time of their seizure .
While the basis for the reported difference in seizure rate is not clear , the threshold for seizures is lowered by significant reductions in serum calcium levels .
Therefore , serum calcium levels should be closely monitored in patients receiving Sensipar ® , particularly in patients with a history of a seizure disorder ( see PRECAUTIONS , Hypocalcemia ) .
Hypotension and / or Worsening Heart Failure In postmarketing safety surveillance , isolated , idiosyncratic cases of hypotension , worsening heart failure , and / or arrhythmia have been reported in patients with impaired cardiac function , in which a causal relationship to Sensipar ® could not be completely excluded and which may be mediated by reductions in serum calcium levels .
Clinical trial data showed hypotension occurred in 7 % of Sensipar ® - treated patients and 12 % of placebo - treated patients , heart failure occurred in 2 % of both Sensipar ® - and placebo - treated patients .
PRECAUTIONS General Hypocalcemia Sensipar ® lowers serum calcium , and therefore patients should be carefully monitored for the occurrence of hypocalcemia .
Potential manifestations of hypocalcemia include paresthesias , myalgias , cramping , tetany , and convulsions .
Sensipar ® treatment should not be initiated if serum calcium is less than the lower limit of the normal range ( 8 . 4 mg / dL ) .
Serum calcium should be measured within 1 week after initiation or dose adjustment of Sensipar ® .
Once the maintenance dose has been established , serum calcium should be measured approximately monthly ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
If serum calcium falls below 8 . 4 mg / dL but remains above 7 . 5 mg / dL , or if symptoms of hypocalcemia occur , calcium - containing phosphate binders and / or vitamin D sterols can be used to raise serum calcium .
If serum calcium falls below 7 . 5 mg / dL , or if symptoms of hypocalcemia persist and the dose of vitamin D cannot be increased , withhold administration of Sensipar ® until serum calcium levels reach 8 . 0 mg / dL , and / or symptoms of hypocalcemia have resolved .
Treatment should be re - initiated using the next lowest dose of Sensipar ® ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
In the 26 - week studies of patients with CKD on dialysis , 66 % of patients receiving Sensipar ® compared with 25 % of patients receiving placebo developed at least one serum calcium value < 8 . 4 mg / dL .
Less than 1 % of patients in each group permanently discontinued study drug due to hypocalcemia .
Sensipar ® is not indicated for CKD patients not on dialysis .
In CKD patients with secondary HPT not on dialysis , the long - term safety and efficacy of Sensipar ® have not been established .
Clinical studies indicate that Sensipar ® - treated CKD patients not on dialysis have an increased risk for hypocalcemia compared to Sensipar ® - treated CKD patients on dialysis , which may be due to lower baseline calcium levels .
In a phase 3 study of 32 weeks duration and including 404 subjects ( 302 cinacalcet , 102 placebo ) , in which the median dose for cinacalcet was 60 mg at the completion of the study , 80 % of Sensipar ® - treated patients experienced at least one serum calcium value < 8 . 4 mg / dL compared to 5 % of patients receiving placebo .
Adynamic Bone Disease Adynamic bone disease may develop if iPTH levels are suppressed below 100 pg / mL .
One clinical study evaluated bone histomorphometry in patients treated with Sensipar ® for one year .
Three patients with mild hyperparathyroid bone disease at the beginning of the study developed adynamic bone disease during treatment with Sensipar ® .
Two of these patients had iPTH levels below 100 pg / mL at multiple time points during the study .
In the three 6 - month , phase 3 studies conducted in CKD patients on dialysis , 11 % of patients treated with Sensipar ® had mean iPTH values below 100 pg / mL during the efficacy - assessment phase .
If iPTH levels decrease below the NKF - K / DOQI recommended target range ( 150 - 300 pg / mL ) 1 in patients treated with Sensipar ® , the dose of Sensipar ® and / or vitamin D sterols should be reduced or therapy discontinued .
Hepatic Insufficiency Cinacalcet exposure as assessed by AUC ( 0 - inf ) in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment ( as indicated by the Child - Pugh method ) were 2 . 4 and 4 . 2 times higher , respectively , than that in normals .
Patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment should be monitored throughout treatment with Sensipar ® ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Information for Patients It is recommended that Sensipar ® be taken with food or shortly after a meal .
Tablets should be taken whole and should not be divided .
Laboratory Tests Patients with CKD on Dialysis with Secondary Hyperparathyroidism Serum calcium and serum phosphorus should be measured within 1 week and iPTH should be measured 1 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment of Sensipar ® .
Once the maintenance dose has been established , serum calcium and serum phosphorus should be measured approximately monthly , and PTH every 1 to 3 months ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
All iPTH measurements during the Sensipar ® trials were obtained using the Nichols IRMA .
In patients with end - stage renal disease , testosterone levels are often below the normal range .
In a placebo - controlled trial in patients with CKD on dialysis , there were reductions in total and free testosterone in male patients following six months of treatment with Sensipar ® .
Levels of total testosterone decreased by a median of 15 . 8 % in the Sensipar ® - treated patients and by 0 . 6 % in the placebo - treated patients .
Levels of free testosterone decreased by a median of 31 . 3 % in the Sensipar ® - treated patients and by 16 . 3 % in the placebo - treated patients .
The clinical significance of these reductions in serum testosterone is unknown .
Patients with Parathyroid Carcinoma Serum calcium should be measured within 1 week after initiation or dose adjustment of Sensipar ® .
Once maintenance dose levels have been established , serum calcium should be measured every 2 months ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Drug Interactions and / or Drug / Laboratory Test Interactions See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics and Drug Interactions .
Effect of Sensipar ® on other drugs : Drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ) : Sensipar ® is a strong in vitro , as well as in vivo , inhibitor of CYP2D6 .
Therefore , dose adjustments of concomitant medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 ( eg , metoprolol and carvedilol ) and particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index ( eg , flecainide , vinblastine , thioridazine and most tricyclic antidepressants ) may be required .
Desipramine : Concurrent administration of cinacalcet ( 90 mg ) with desipramine ( 50 mg ) increased the exposure of desipramine by 3 . 6 fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
Amitriptyline : Concurrent administration of 25 mg or 100 mg cinacalcet with 50 mg amitriptyline increased amitriptyline exposure and nortriptyline ( active metabolite ) exposure by approximately 20 % in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers .
Midazolam : There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of midazolam , a CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 substrate , in subjects receiving 90 mg cinacalcet once daily for 5 days and a single dose of 2 mg midazolam on day 5 as compared to those of subjects receiving 2 mg midazolam alone .
This suggests that cinacalcet would not affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 .
Effect of other drugs on Sensipar ® : Sensipar ® is metabolized by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes , primarily CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 , and CYP1A2 .
Ketoconazole : Sensipar ® is metabolized in part by CYP3A4 .
Co - administration of ketoconazole , a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 , increased cinacalcet exposure following a single 90 mg dose of Sensipar ® by 2 . 3 fold .
Dose adjustment of Sensipar ® may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ( e . g . , ketoconazole , erythromycin , itraconazole ; see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , and Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity : Standard lifetime dietary carcinogenicity bioassays were conducted in mice and rats .
Mice were given dietary doses of 15 , 50 , 125 mg / kg / day in males and 30 , 70 , 200 mg / kg / day in females ( exposures up to 2 times those resulting with a human oral dose of 180 mg / day based on AUC comparison ) .
Rats were given dietary doses of 5 , 15 , 35 mg / kg / day in males and 5 , 20 , 35 mg / kg / day in females ( exposures up to 2 times those resulting with a human oral dose of 180 mg / day based on AUC comparison ) .
No increased incidence of tumors was observed following treatment with cinacalcet .
Mutagenicity : Cinacalcet was not genotoxic in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay or in the Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cell HGPRT forward mutation assay and CHO cell chromosomal aberration assay , with and without metabolic activation or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
Impairment of Fertility : Female rats were given oral gavage doses of 5 , 25 , 75 mg / kg / day beginning 2 weeks before mating and continuing through gestation day 7 .
Male rats were given oral doses 4 weeks prior to mating , during mating ( 3 weeks ) and 2 weeks post - mating .
No effects were observed in male or female fertility at 5 and 25 mg / kg / day ( exposures up to 3 times those resulting with a human oral dose of 180 mg / day based on AUC comparison ) .
At 75 mg / kg / day , there were slight adverse effects ( slight decreases in body weight and food consumption ) in males and females .
Pregnancy Category C In pregnant female rats given oral gavage doses of 2 , 25 , 50 mg / kg / day during gestation no teratogenicity was observed at doses up to 50 mg / kg / day ( exposure 4 times those resulting with a human oral dose of 180 mg / day based on AUC comparison ) .
Decreased fetal body weights were observed at all doses ( less than 1 to 4 times a human oral dose of 180 mg / day based on AUC comparison ) in conjunction with maternal toxicity ( decreased food consumption and body weight gain ) .
In pregnant female rabbits given oral gavage doses of 2 , 12 , 25 mg / kg / day during gestation no adverse fetal effects were observed ( exposures less than with a human oral dose of 180 mg / day based on AUC comparisons ) .
Reductions in maternal food consumption and body weight gain were seen at doses of 12 and 25 mg / kg / day .
In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 5 , 15 , 25 mg / kg / day during gestation through lactation no adverse fetal or pup ( post - weaning ) effects were observed at 5 mg / kg / day ( exposures less than with a human therapeutic dose of 180 mg / day based on AUC comparisons ) .
Higher doses of 15 and 25 mg / kg / day ( exposures 2 - 3 times a human oral dose of 180 mg / day based on AUC comparisons ) were accompanied by maternal signs of hypocalcemia ( periparturient mortality and early postnatal pup loss ) , and reductions in postnatal maternal and pup body - weight gain .
Sensipar ® has been shown to cross the placental barrier in rabbits .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Sensipar ® should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Lactating Women Studies in rats have shown that Sensipar ® is excreted in the milk with a high milk - to - plasma ratio .
It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Considering these data in rats and because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for clinically significant adverse reactions in infants from Sensipar ® , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the lactating woman .
Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Sensipar ® in pediatric patients have not been established .
Geriatric Use Of the 1136 patients enrolled in the Sensipar ® phase 3 clinical program , 26 % were ≥ 65 years old , and 9 % were ≥ 75 years old .
No differences in the safety and efficacy of Sensipar ® were observed in patients greater or less than 65 years of age ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , Geriatric patients ) .
ADVERSE EVENTS Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease on Dialysis In 3 double - blind placebo - controlled clinical trials , 1126 CKD patients on dialysis received study drug ( 656 Sensipar ® , 470 placebo ) for up to 6 months .
The most frequently reported adverse events ( incidence of at least 5 % in the Sensipar ® group and greater than placebo ) are provided in Table 2 .
The most frequently reported events in the Sensipar ® group were nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea .
Table 2 .
Adverse Event Incidence ( ≥ 5 % ) in Patients on DialysisEvent [ 1 ] : Placebo ( n = 470 ) ( % ) Sensipar ® ( n = 656 ) ( % ) Nausea 19 31 Vomiting 15 27 Diarrhea 20 21 Myalgia 14 15 Dizziness 8 10 Hypertension 5 7 Asthenia 4 7 Anorexia 4 6 Pain Chest , Non Cardiac 4 6 Access Infection 4 5 [ 1 ] Included are events that were reported at a greater incidence in the Sensipar ® group than in the placebo group .
The incidence of serious adverse events ( 29 % vs . 31 % ) was similar in the Sensipar ® and placebo groups , respectively .
12 - Month Experience with Sensipar ® : Two hundred and sixty - six patients from 2 phase 3 studies continued to receive Sensipar ® or placebo treatment in a 6 - month double - blind extension study ( 12 - month total treatment duration ) .
The incidence and nature of adverse events in this study were similar in the two treatment groups , and comparable to those observed in the phase 3 studies .
Postmarketing Experience with Sensipar ® : Rash , hypersensitivity reactions ( including angioedema and urticaria ) , diarrhea and myalgia have been identified as adverse reactions during post - approval use of Sensipar ® .
Isolated , idiosyncratic cases of hypotension , worsening heart failure , and / or arrhythmia have been reported in Sensipar ® - treated patients with impaired cardiac function in postmarketing safety surveillance .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Parathyroid Carcinoma The most frequent adverse events in this patient group were nausea and vomiting .
Laboratory values : Serum calcium levels should be closely monitored in patients receiving Sensipar ® ( see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
OVERDOSAGE Doses titrated up to 300 mg once daily have been safely administered to patients on dialysis .
Overdosage of Sensipar ® may lead to hypocalcemia .
In the event of overdosage , patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia and appropriate measures taken to correct serum calcium levels ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
Since Sensipar ® is highly protein bound , hemodialysis is not an effective treatment for overdosage of Sensipar ® .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Sensipar ® tablets should be taken whole and should not be divided .
Sensipar ® should be taken with food or shortly after a meal .
Dosage must be individualized .
Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease on Dialysis The recommended starting oral dose of Sensipar ® is 30 mg once daily .
Serum calcium and serum phosphorus should be measured within 1 week and PTH should be measured 1 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment of Sensipar ® .
Sensipar ® should be titrated no more frequently than every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 60 , 90 , 120 , and 180 mg once daily to target iPTH consistent with the NKF - K / DOQI recommendation for CKD patients on dialysis of 150 - 300 pg / mL .
PTH levels should be assessed no earlier than 12 hours after dosing with Sensipar ® .
Sensipar ® can be used alone or in combination with vitamin D sterols and / or phosphate binders .
During dose titration , serum calcium levels should be monitored frequently and if levels decrease below the normal range , appropriate steps should be taken to increase serum calcium levels , such as by providing supplemental calcium , initiating or increasing the dose of calcium - based phosphate binder , initiating or increasing the dose of vitamin D sterols , or temporarily withholding treatment with Sensipar ® ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
Parathyroid Carcinoma The recommended starting oral dose of Sensipar ® is 30 mg twice daily .
The dosage of Sensipar ® should be titrated every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30 mg twice daily , 60 mg twice daily , 90 mg twice daily , and 90 mg three or four times daily as necessary to normalize serum calcium levels .
Special Populations Geriatric patients : Age does not alter the pharmacokinetics of Sensipar ® ; no dosage adjustment is required for geriatric patients .
Patients with renal impairment : Renal impairment does not alter the pharmacokinetics of Sensipar ® ; no dosage adjustment is necessary for renal impairment .
Patients with hepatic impairment : Cinacalcet exposures , as assessed by AUC ( 0 - inf ) , in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment ( as indicated by the Child - Pugh method ) were 2 . 4 and 4 . 2 times higher , respectively , than in normals .
In patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment , PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored throughout treatment with Sensipar ® ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS ) .
Drug Interactions Sensipar ® is metabolized in part by the enzyme CYP3A4 .
Co - administration of ketoconazole , a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 , caused an approximate 2 - fold increase in cinacalcet exposure .
Dose adjustment of Sensipar ® may be required and PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ( e . g . , ketoconazole , erythromycin , itraconazole ; see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics and PRECAUTIONS ) .
