[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Serum , urine and tear concentrations of ofloxacin were measured in 30 healthy women at various time points during a ten - day course of treatment with ofloxacin ophthalmic solution .
The mean serum ofloxacin concentration ranged from 0 . 4 ng / mL to 1 . 9 ng / mL .
Maximum ofloxacin concentration increased from 1 . 1 ng / mL on day one to 1 . 9 ng / mL on day 11 after QID dosing for 10 1 / 2 days .
Maximum serum ofloxacin concentrations after ten days of topical ophthalmic dosing were more than 1 , 000 times lower than those reported after standard oral doses of ofloxacin .
Tear ofloxacin concentrations ranged from 5 . 7 to 31 mcg / g during the 40 minute period following the last dose on day 11 .
Mean tear concentration measured four hours after topical ophthalmic dosing was 9 . 2 mcg / g .
Corneal tissue concentrations of 4 . 4 mcg / mL were observed four hours after beginning topical ocular application of two drops of ofloxacin ophthalmic solution every 30 minutes .
Ofloxacin was excreted in the urine primarily unmodified .
Microbiology Ofloxacin has in vitro activity against a broad range of gram - positive and gram - negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria .
Ofloxacin is bactericidal at concentrations equal to or slightly greater than inhibitory concentrations .
Ofloxacin is thought to exert a bactericidal effect on susceptible bacterial cells by inhibiting DNA gyrase , an essential bacterial enzyme which is a critical catalyst in the duplication , transcription , and repair of bacterial DNA .
Cross - resistance has been observed between ofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones .
There is generally no cross - resistance between ofloxacin and other classes of antibacterial agents such as beta - lactams or aminoglycosides .
Ofloxacin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following organisms both in vitro and clinically , in conjunctival and / or corneal ulcer infections ( see Indications and Usage ) .

Clinical outcomes for the trial demonstrated a clinical improvement rate of 86 % ( 54 / 63 ) for the ofloxacin treated group versus 72 % ( 48 / 67 ) for the placebo treated group after 2 days of therapy .
Microbiological outcomes for the same clinical trial demonstrated an eradication rate for causative pathogens of 65 % ( 41 / 63 ) for the ofloxacin treated group versus 25 % ( 17 / 67 ) for the vehicle treated group after 2 days of therapy .
Please note that microbiologic eradication does not always correlate with clinical outcome in anti - infective trials .
Corneal Ulcers In a randomized , double - masked , multi - center clinical trial of 140 subjects with positive cultures , ofloxacin ophthalmic solution treated subjects had an overall clinical success rate ( complete re - epithelialization and no progression of the infiltrate for two consecutive visits ) of 82 % ( 61 / 74 ) compared to 80 % ( 53 / 66 ) for the fortified antibiotic group , consisting of 1 . 5 % tobramycin and 10 % cefazolin solutions .
The median time to clinical success was 11 days for the ofloxacin treated group and 10 days for the fortified treatment group .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ofloxacin ophthalmic solution is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the following bacteria in the conditions listed below : * Efficacy for this organism was studied in fewer than 10 infections CONJUNCTIVITIS Gram - positive bacteria Gram - negative bacteria Staphylococcus aureus Enterobacter cloacae Staphylococcus epidermidis Haemophilus influenzae Streptococcus pneumoniae Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa CORNEAL ULCERS Gram - positive bacteria Gram - negative bacteria Staphylococcus aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa Staphylococcus epidermidis Serratia marcescens * Streptococcus pneumoniae Anaerobic species : Propionibacterium acnes CONTRAINDICATIONS Ofloxacin ophthalmic solution is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to ofloxacin , to other quinolones , or to any of the components in this medication ( see Warnings ) .
WARNINGS NOT FOR INJECTION .
Ofloxacin ophthalmic solution should not be injected subconjunctivally , nor should it be introduced directly into the anterior chamber of the eye .
There are rare reports of anaphylactic reaction / shock and fatal hypersensitivity reactions in patients receiving systemic quinolones , some following the first dose , including ofloxacin .
Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse , loss of consciousness , angioedema ( including laryngeal , pharyngeal or facial edema ) , airway obstruction , dyspnea , urticaria , and itching .
A rare occurrence of Stevens - Johnson syndrome , which progressed to toxic epidermal necrolysis , has been reported in a patient who was receiving topical ophthalmic ofloxacin .
If an allergic reaction to ofloxacin occurs , discontinue the drug .
Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require immediate emergency treatment .
Oxygen and airway management , including intubation should be administered as clinically indicated .
PRECAUTIONS General As with other anti - infectives , prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms , including fungi .
If superinfection occurs discontinue use and institute alternative therapy .
Whenever clinical judgment dictates , the patient should be examined with the aid of magnification , such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and , where appropriate , fluorescein staining .
Ofloxacin should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity reaction .
The systemic administration of quinolones , including ofloxacin , has led to lesions or erosions of the cartilage in weight - bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species .
Ofloxacin , administered systemically at 10 mg / kg / day in young dogs ( equivalent to 110 times the maximum recommended daily adult ophthalmic dose ) has been associated with these types of effects .
Information for Patients Avoid contaminating the applicator tip with material from the eye , fingers or other source .
Systemic quinolones , including ofloxacin , have been associated with hypersensitivity reactions , even following a single dose .
Discontinue use immediately and contact your physician at the first sign of a rash or allergic reaction .
Drug Interactions Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with ofloxacin ophthalmic solution .
However , the systemic administration of some quinolones has been shown to elevate plasma concentrations of theophylline , interfere with the metabolism of caffeine , and enhance the effects of the oral anticoagulant warfarin and its derivatives , and has been associated with transient elevations in serum creatinine in patients receiving cyclosporine concomitantly .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long term studies to determine the carcinogenic potential of ofloxacin have not been conducted .
Ofloxacin was not mutagenic in the Ames test , in vitro and in vivo cytogenic assay , sister chromatid exchange assay ( Chinese hamster and human cell lines ) , unscheduled DNA synthesis ( UDS ) assay using human fibroblasts , the dominant lethal assay , or mouse micronucleus assay .
Ofloxacin was positive in the UDS test using rat hepatocyte , and in the mouse lymphoma assay .
In fertility studies in rats , ofloxacin did not affect male or female fertility or morphological or reproductive performance at oral dosing up to 360 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 4 , 000 times the maximum recommended daily ophthalmic dose ) .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Ofloxacin has been shown to have an embryocidal effect in rats and in rabbits when given in doses of 810 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 9 , 000 times the maximum recommended daily ophthalmic dose ) and 160 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 1 , 800 times the maximum recommended daily ophthalmic dose ) .
These dosages resulted in decreased fetal body weight and increased fetal mortality in rats and rabbits , respectively .
Minor fetal skeletal variations were reported in rats receiving doses of 810 mg / kg / day .
Ofloxacin has not been shown to be teratogenic at doses as high as 810 mg / kg / day and 160 mg / kg / day when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits , respectively .
Nonteratogenic Effects Additional studies in rats with doses up to 360 mg / kg / day during late gestation showed no adverse effect on late fetal development , labor , delivery , lactation , neonatal viability , or growth of the newborn .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Ofloxacin ophthalmic solution should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Nursing Mothers In nursing women a single 200 mg oral dose resulted in concentrations of ofloxacin in milk which were similar to those found in plasma .
It is not known whether ofloxacin is excreted in human milk following topical ophthalmic administration .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from ofloxacin in nursing infants , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in infants below the age of one year have not been established .
Quinolones , including ofloxacin , have been shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals after oral administration ; however , topical ocular administration of ofloxacin to immature animals has not shown any arthropathy .
There is no evidence that the ophthalmic dosage form of ofloxacin has any effect on weight - bearing joints .
Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Ophthalmic Use The most frequently reported drug - related adverse reaction was transient ocular burning or discomfort .
Other reported reactions include stinging , redness , itching , chemical conjunctivitis / keratitis , ocular / periocular / facial edema , foreign body sensation , photophobia , blurred vision , tearing , dryness , and eye pain .
Rare reports of dizziness and nausea have been received .
Refer to Warnings for additional adverse reactions .
