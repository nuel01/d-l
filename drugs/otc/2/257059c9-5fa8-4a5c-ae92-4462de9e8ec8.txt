8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) • • Hepatic Impairment : Reduce the starting dose of VITRAKVI in patients with moderate ( Child - Pugh B ) to severe ( Child - Pugh C ) hepatic impairment .
( 2 . 6 , 8 . 7 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on literature reports in human subjects with congenital mutations leading to changes in TRK signaling , findings from animal studies , and its mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] , VITRAKVI can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no available data on VITRAKVI use in pregnant women .
Administration of larotrectinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in malformations at maternal exposures that were approximately 11 - and 0 . 7 - times , respectively , those observed at the clinical dose of 100 mg twice daily ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data Published reports of individuals with congenital mutations in TRK pathway proteins suggest that decreases in TRK - mediated signaling are correlated with obesity , developmental delays , cognitive impairment , insensitivity to pain , and anhidrosis .
Animal Data Larotrectinib crosses the placenta in animals .
Larotrectinib did not result in embryolethality at maternally toxic doses [ up to 40 times the human exposure based on area under the curve ( AUC ) at the clinical dose of 100 mg twice daily ] in embryo - fetal development studies in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis ; however , larotrectinib was associated with fetal anasarca in rats from dams treated at twice - daily doses of 40 mg / kg [ 11 times the human exposure ( AUC ) at the clinical dose of 100 mg twice daily ] .
In pregnant rabbits , larotrectinib administration was associated with omphalocele at twice - daily doses of 15 mg / kg ( 0 . 7 times the human exposure at the clinical dose of 100 mg twice daily ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of larotrectinib or its metabolites in human milk and no data on its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with larotrectinib and for 1 week after the final dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating VITRAKVI [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception VITRAKVI can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VITRAKVI and for at least 1 week after the final dose .
Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VITRAKVI and for 1 week after the final dose .
Infertility Females Based on histopathological findings in the reproductive tracts of female rats in a 1 - month repeated - dose study , VITRAKVI may reduce fertility [ See Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of VITRAKVI in pediatric patients was established based upon data from three multicenter , open - label , single - arm clinical trials in adult or pediatric patients 28 days and older [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The efficacy of VITRAKVI was evaluated in 12 pediatric patients and is described in the Clinical Studies section [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The safety of VITRAKVI was evaluated in 92 pediatric patients who received VITRAKVI .
Of these 92 patients , 36 % were < 1 month to < 2 years ( n = 33 ) , 41 % were 2 years to < 12 years ( n = 38 ) , and 23 % were 12 years to < 18 years ( n = 21 ) ; 29 % had metastatic disease , 42 % had locally advanced disease , and 27 % had primary CNS ; and 86 % had received prior treatment for their cancer , including surgery , radiotherapy , or systemic therapy .
The most common cancers were infantile fibrosarcoma ( 37 % ) , primary CNS tumors ( 27 % ) , soft tissue sarcoma ( 24 % ) , and thyroid cancer ( 7 % ) .
The median duration of exposure was 7 . 4 months ( range : 0 . 4 months to 39 months ) .
Due to the small number of pediatric and adult patients , the single arm design of clinical studies of VITRAKVI , and confounding factors such as differences in susceptibility to infections between pediatric and adult patients , it is not possible to determine whether differences in the incidence of adverse reactions to VITRAKVI are related to patient age or other factors .
Adverse reactions occurring more frequently ( at least a 10 % increase in per - patient incidence ) in pediatric patients compared to adult patients were pyrexia ( 45 % versus 13 % ) , vomiting ( 42 % versus 17 % in adults ) , diarrhea ( 35 % versus 23 % in adults ) , rash ( 28 % versus 15 % in adults ) , upper respiratory tract infection ( 23 % versus 8 % in adults ) , nasopharyngitis ( 16 % versus 6 % in adults ) , and otitis media and rhinitis ( each 14 % versus 0 . 5 % in adults ) .
Laboratory abnormalities occurring more frequently ( at least a 10 % increase in per - patient incidence ) in pediatric patients compared to adult patients were AST increased ( 63 % versus 49 % in adults ) , neutrophil count decrease ( 60 % versus 16 % in adults ) , leukocyte count decrease ( 39 % versus 27 % in adults ) , hyperkalemia ( 36 % versus 15 % ) , and lymphocyte increase ( 24 % versus 0 . 5 % ) .
Two of the 92 pediatric patients discontinued VITRAKVI due to an adverse reaction ( Grade 3 increased ALT and Grade 3 decreased neutrophil count ) .
The pharmacokinetics of VITRAKVI in the pediatric population were similar to those seen in adults [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Larotrectinib was administered in a juvenile toxicity study in rats at twice daily doses of 0 . 2 , 2 and 7 . 5 mg / kg from postnatal day ( PND ) 7 to 27 and at twice daily doses of 0 . 6 , 6 and 22 . 5 mg / kg between PND 28 and 70 .
The dosing period was equivalent to human pediatric populations from newborn to adulthood .
The doses of 2 / 6 mg / kg twice daily [ approximately 0 . 7 times the human exposure ( AUC ) at the clinical dose of 100 mg twice daily ] and 7 . 5 / 22 . 5 mg / kg twice daily ( approximately 4 times the human exposure at the clinical dose of 100 mg twice daily ) resulted in mortality between PND 9 to 99 ; a definitive cause of death was not identified in the majority of cases .
The main findings were transient central nervous system - related signs including head flick , tremor , and circling in both sexes .
An increase in the number of errors in a maze swim test occurred in females at exposures of approximately 4 times the human exposure ( AUC ) at the clinical dose of 100 mg twice daily .
Decreased growth and delays in sexual development occurred in the mid - and high - dose groups .
Mating was normal in treated animals , but a reduction in pregnancy rate occurred at the high - dose of 7 . 5 / 22 . 5 mg / kg twice daily ( approximately 4 times the human exposure at the clinical dose of 100 mg twice daily ) .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of 279 patients in the overall safety population who received VITRAKVI , 19 % of patients were ≥ 65 years of age and 5 % of patients were ≥ 75 years of age .
Clinical studies of VITRAKVI did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh A ) .
Larotrectinib clearance was reduced in subjects with moderate ( Child - Pugh B ) to severe ( Child - Pugh C ) hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Reduce VITRAKVI dose as recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment of any severity [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

The molecular formula for larotrectinib sulfate is C21H24F2N6O6S and the molecular weight is 526 . 51 g / mol for the sulfate salt and 428 . 44 g / mol for the free base .
The chemical name is ( 3 S ) - N - { 5 - [ ( 2 R ) - 2 - ( 2 , 5 - difluorophenyl ) - 1 - pyrrolidinyl ] pyrazolo [ 1 , 5 - a ] pyrimidin - 3 - yl } - 3 - hydroxy - 1 - pyrrolidinecarboxamide sulfate .
Larotrectinib sulfate has the following chemical structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Larotrectinib sulfate is an off - white to pinkish yellow solid that is not hygroscopic .
The aqueous solubility of larotrectinib at 37ᴼC is pH dependent ( very soluble at pH 1 . 0 and freely soluble at pH 6 . 8 , according to USP descriptive terms of solubility ) .
VITRAKVI ( larotrectinib ) capsules and oral solution are for oral use .
Each capsule contains 25 mg or 100 mg larotrectinib ( 30 . 7 mg and 123 mg larotrectinib sulfate , respectively ) in a hard gelatin capsule .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Larotrectinib is an inhibitor of the tropomyosin receptor kinases ( TRK ) , TRKA , TRKB , and TRKC .
In a broad panel of purified enzyme assays , larotrectinib inhibited TRKA , TRKB , and TRKC with IC50 values between 5 - 11 nM .
One other kinase TNK2 was inhibited at approximately 100 - fold higher concentration .
TRKA , B , and C are encoded by the genes NTRK1 , NTRK2 , and NTRK3 .
Chromosomal rearrangements involving in - frame fusions of these genes with various partners can result in constitutively - activated chimeric TRK fusion proteins that can act as an oncogenic driver , promoting cell proliferation and survival in tumor cell lines .
In in vitro and in vivo tumor models , larotrectinib demonstrated anti - tumor activity in cells with constitutive activation of TRK proteins resulting from gene fusions , deletion of a protein regulatory domain , or in cells with TRK protein overexpression .
Larotrectinib had minimal activity in cell lines with point mutations in the TRKA kinase domain , including the clinically identified acquired resistance mutation , G595R .
Point mutations in the TRKC kinase domain with clinically identified acquired resistance to larotrectinib include G623R , G696A , and F617L .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 9 - fold higher than the recommended adult dose , VITRAKVI does not prolong QTc intervals to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of larotrectinib were studied in healthy subjects and adult and pediatric patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors .
In healthy subjects who received a single dose of VITRAKVI capsules , systemic exposure ( Cmax and AUC ) of larotrectinib was dose proportional over the dose range of 100 mg to 400 mg ( 1 to 4 times the recommended adult dose ) and slightly greater than proportional at doses of 600 mg to 900 mg ( 6 to 9 times the recommended adult dose ) .
In adult patients who received VITRAKVI capsules 100 mg twice daily in Study LOXO - TRK - 14001 , peak plasma levels ( Cmax ) of larotrectinib were achieved at approximately 1 hour after dosing and steady - state was reached within 3 days .
Mean steady - state larotrectinib [ coefficient of variation ( CV % ) ] for Cmax was 788 ( 81 % ) ng / mL and AUC0 - 24 hr was 4351 ( 97 % ) ng * h / mL .
Absorption The mean absolute bioavailability of VITRAKVI capsules was 34 % ( range : 32 % to 37 % ) .
In healthy subjects , the AUC of VITRAKVI oral solution was similar to that of the capsules and the Cmax was 36 % higher with the oral solution .
Effect of Food The AUC of larotrectinib was similar and the Cmax was reduced by 35 % after oral administration of a single 100 mg capsule of VITRAKVI to healthy subjects taken with a high - fat meal ( approximately 900 calories , 58 grams carbohydrate , 56 grams fat and 43 grams protein ) compared to the Cmax and AUC in the fasted state .
Distribution The mean ( CV % ) volume of distribution ( Vss ) of larotrectinib is 48 ( 38 % ) L following intravenous administration of larotrectinib in healthy subjects .
Larotrectinib is 70 % bound to human plasma proteins in vitro and binding is independent of drug concentrations .
The blood - to - plasma concentration ratio is 0 . 9 .
Elimination The mean ( CV % ) clearance ( CL / F ) of larotrectinib is 98 ( 44 % ) L / h and the half - life is 2 . 9 hours following oral administration of VITRAKVI in healthy subjects .
Metabolism Larotrectinib is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4 .
Following oral administration of a single [ 14 C ] radiolabeled 100 mg dose of larotrectinib to healthy subjects , unchanged larotrectinib constituted 19 % and an O - linked glucuronide constituted 26 % of the major circulating radioactive drug components in plasma .
Excretion Following oral administration of a single [ 14 C ] radiolabeled 100 mg dose of larotrectinib to healthy subjects , 58 % ( 5 % unchanged ) of the administered radioactivity was recovered in feces and 39 % ( 20 % unchanged ) was recovered in urine .
Specific Populations Age ( range : 28 days to 82 years ) , sex , and body weight ( range : 3 . 8 kg to 179 kg ) had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of larotrectinib .
Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients , the larotrectinib geometric mean ( % CV ) AUC0 - 24 hr by age subgroup was : 3348 ( 66 % ) ng * h / mL in patients 1 month to < 2 years ( n = 9 ) , 4135 ( 36 % ) ng * h / mL in patients 2 to < 12 years ( n = 15 ) , and 3108 ( 69 % ) ng * h / mL and in patients 12 to < 18 years ( n = 9 ) .
Patients with Renal Impairment Following oral administration of a single 100 mg dose of VITRAKVI capsules in subjects with end - stage renal disease ( e . g . , subjects who required dialysis ) , the AUC0 - INF of larotrectinib increased 1 . 5 - fold and Cmax increased 1 . 3 - fold as compared to that in subjects with normal renal function ( creatinine clearance ≥ 90 mL / min as estimated by Cockcroft - Gault ) .
The pharmacokinetics of VITRAKVI in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance ≤ 60 mL / min ) have not been studied .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following oral administration of a single 100 mg dose of VITRAKVI capsules , the AUC0 - INF of larotrectinib increased 1 . 3 - fold in subjects with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh A ) , 2 - fold in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh B ) and 3 . 2 - fold in subjects with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) as compared to that in subjects with normal hepatic function .
The Cmax was similar in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and the Cmax of larotrectinib increased 1 . 5 - fold in subjects with severe hepatic impairment as compared to that in subjects with normal hepatic function [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors : Coadministration of a single 100 mg dose of VITRAKVI capsules with itraconazole ( strong CYP3A inhibitor ) increased the AUC0 - INF of larotrectinib by 4 . 3 - fold and the Cmax by 2 . 8 - fold as compared to VITRAKVI administered alone [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Coadministration of VITRAKVI with fluconazole ( moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor ) is predicted to increase VITRAKVI steady state AUC by 2 . 7 - fold and Cmax by 1 . 9 - fold .
Effect of CYP3A Inducers : Coadministration of a single 100 mg dose of VITRAKVI capsules with rifampin ( strong CYP3A inducer ) decreased the AUC0 - INF of larotrectinib by 81 % and the Cmax by 71 % as compared to VITRAKVI administered alone [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Coadministration of VITRAKVI with efavirenz ( moderate CYP3A4 inducer ) is predicted to decrease steady state AUC of VITRAKVI by approximately 72 % and Cmax by 60 % compared to VITRAKVI administered alone [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Effect of Strong P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) Inhibitors : Coadministration of a single 100 mg dose of VITRAKVI capsules with a P - gp inhibitor ( rifampin ) increased the AUC0 - INF of larotrectinib by 1 . 7 - fold and the Cmax by 1 . 8 - fold as compared to VITRAKVI administered alone .
Effect of Larotrectinib on CYP3A4 Substrates : Coadministration of VITRAKVI capsules 100 mg twice daily with a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate ( midazolam ) increased both the AUC0 - INF and Cmax of midazolam by 1 . 7 - fold as compared to midazolam administered alone .
The AUC0 - INF and Cmax of 1 - hydroxymidazolam , the main metabolite of midazolam , were both increased 1 . 4 - fold as compared to when midazolam was administered alone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with larotrectinib .
Larotrectinib was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assays , with or without metabolic activation , or in the in vitro mammalian mutagenesis assays , with or without metabolic activation .
In vivo , larotrectinib was negative in the mouse micronucleus test .
Fertility studies with larotrectinib have not been conducted .
In a 3 - month repeat - dose toxicity study in the rat , larotrectinib had no effects on spermatogenesis at 75 mg / kg / day ( approximately 7 times the human exposure at the 100 mg twice daily dose ) .
Additionally , larotrectinib had no histological effects on the male reproductive tract in rats or monkeys at doses resulting in exposures up to 10 times the human exposure ( AUC0 - 24 hr ) at the 100 mg twice daily clinical dose .
In a 1 - month repeat - dose study in the rat , decreased uterine weight and uterine atrophy were seen at 200 mg / kg / day [ approximately 45 times the human exposure ( AUC ) at the 100 mg twice daily dose ] .
Fewer corpora lutea and increased incidence of anestrus were also noted at doses ≥ 60 mg / kg / day ( approximately 10 times the human exposure at the 100 mg twice daily dose ) .
Decreased fertility occurred in a juvenile animal study [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
There were no findings in female reproductive organs in repeat - dose studies in monkeys at exposures up to 22 times the human exposure at the 100 mg twice daily dose .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology In general toxicology studies conducted in rats and monkeys and in reproductive toxicology studies conducted in rats and rabbits , administration of larotrectinib led to increased food consumption and increased body weight at doses resulting in exposures 0 . 6 times the human exposure at the 100 mg twice daily clinical dose .
Obesity has also been one phenotypic outcome of some human syndromes resulting from congenital mutations in NTRK2 resulting in altered TRK signaling .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of VITRAKVI was evaluated in pediatric and adult patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with a NTRK gene fusion enrolled in one of three multicenter , open - label , single - arm clinical trials : Study LOXO - TRK - 14001 ( NCT02122913 ) , SCOUT ( NCT02637687 ) , and NAVIGATE ( NCT02576431 ) .
All patients were required to have progressed following systemic therapy for their disease , if available , or would have required surgery with significant morbidity for locally advanced disease .
Adult patients received VITRAKVI 100 mg orally twice daily and pediatric patients ( 18 years or younger ) received VITRAKVI 100 mg / m2 up to a maximum dose of 100 mg orally twice daily until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression .
Identification of positive NTRK gene fusion status was prospectively determined in local laboratories using next generation sequencing ( NGS ) or fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) .
NTRK gene fusions were inferred in three patients with infantile fibrosarcoma who had a documented ETV6 translocation identified by FISH .
The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate ( ORR ) and duration of response ( DOR ) , as determined by a blinded independent review committee ( BIRC ) according to RECIST v1 . 1 .
The assessment of efficacy was based on the first 55 patients with solid tumors with an NTRK gene fusion enrolled across the three clinical trials .
Baseline characteristics were : median age 45 years ( range 4 months to 76 years ) ; 22 % < 18 years of age , and 78 % ≥ 18 years of age ; 53 % male ; 67 % White ; 7 % Hispanic / Latino , 4 % Asian , 4 % Black ; and ECOG performance status ( PS ) 0 - 1 ( 93 % ) or 2 ( 7 % ) .
Eighty - two percent of patients had metastatic disease , including patients with brain metastases , and 18 % had locally advanced , unresectable disease .
Ninety - eight percent of patients had received prior treatment for their cancer , including surgery , radiotherapy , or systemic therapy .
Of these , 82 % ( n = 45 ) received prior systemic therapy with a median of two prior systemic regimens and 35 % ( n = 19 ) received three or more prior systemic regimens .
The most common cancers were salivary gland tumors ( 22 % ) , soft tissue sarcoma ( 20 % ) , infantile fibrosarcoma ( 13 % ) , and thyroid cancer ( 9 % ) .
A total of 50 patients had NTRK gene fusions detected by NGS and 5 patients had NTRK gene fusions detected by FISH .
Efficacy results are summarized in Tables 4 , 5 , and 6 .
