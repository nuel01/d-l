Administer either PRISMASOL or PHOXILLUM into the extracorporeal circuit : • • Before ( pre - dilution ) the hemofilter or hemodiafilter , • • After ( post - dilution ) the hemofilter or hemodiafilter , or • • Before and after the hemofilter or hemodiafilter .
2 . 3 Preparing the Solution Use only if the overwrap is not damaged , all seals are intact , peel seal is not broken , and the solution is clear .
The solution may be warmed to 37 ° C / 98 . 6 ° F prior to removing the overwrap to enhance patient comfort .
However , only dry heat should be used .
Solutions should not be heated in water or in a microwave oven .
After heating , verify that the solution remains clear and contains no particulate matter .
The solutions are supplied in two different two - compartment bags made of polyolefin with a peel seal separating compartment A and B ( see Figure 1 ) .
Follow the instructions below when connecting the solution bags for correct use of the access ports .
Instructions for preparing solutions supplied in a two - compartment , polyolefin bag with a peel seal : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 2 [ MULTIMEDIA ] Step 1 Immediately before use , remove the overwrap from the bag and mix the solutions in the two different compartments .
After removing the overwrap , inspect the bag for leakage by pressing firmly on the bag .
Discard the bag if any leakage is detected since sterility cannot be assured .
As soon as the overwrap is removed , the reconstitution of compartments A and B should be done and the mixed solution should be used immediately .
After removal of the overwrap , the solution is stable for 24 hours including the duration of the treatment .
Hold the small compartment with both hands and squeeze it until an opening is created in the peel seal .
( See Figure 2 beside ) Figure 3 [ MULTIMEDIA ] Step 2 Squeeze with both hands on the large compartment until the peel seal between the two compartments is entirely open .
Shake gently to mix .
( See Figure 3 beside ) The solution is now ready to use and the bag can be hung on the equipment .
Figure 4 a [ MULTIMEDIA ] Step 3 The replacement line may be connected to the bag through either of the luer connector or the injection connector ( spike connector ) .
Step 3 a The luer connector is a needle - less and swabbable connector .
Remove the cap with a twist and pull motion , and connect the male luer lock on the replacement line to the female luer receptor on the bag .
( See Figure 4 a beside ) Ensure that the connection is fully seated and tighten .
The connector is now open .
Verify that the fluid is flowing freely during use .
When the replacement line is disconnected from the luer connector , the connector will close and the flow of the solution will stop .
Figure 4 b [ MULTIMEDIA ] Step 3 b If the injection connector ( spike connector ) is used , first remove the snap - off cap .
Then introduce the replacement line spike through the rubber septum of the bag connector .
( See Figure 4 b beside ) Ensure that the spike is fully inserted and verify that the fluid is flowing freely during use .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 2 . 4 Adding Drugs to the Solutions After mixing , additional drugs may be added to the bag via injection connector ( spike connector ) in large compartment B .
In general , administer drugs other than phosphate through a different access line .
When introducing drugs , use aseptic techniques and mix thoroughly prior to connecting the solution bag to the extracorporeal circuit .
Do not use if there is a color change and / or the appearance of precipitates , insoluble complexes or crystals after addition of medication .
Phosphate : Up to 1 . 2 mmol / L of phosphate can be added to the bag as potassium phosphate or sodium phosphate .
The total potassium concentration of PRISMASOL solution should not exceed 4 mEq / L .
Use sodium phosphate to add phosphate if the total potassium concentration in PRISMASOL solution is 4 mEq / L .
PHOXILLUM Solutions : Phosphate : Phosphate up to 0 . 2 mmol / L may be added to the solution .
Use sodium phosphate if adding phosphate to bag .
The total phosphate concentration should not exceed 1 . 2 mmol / L .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM solutions are pharmacologically inactive .
The electrolyte concentrations in the solutions are chosen to restore plasma levels to clinically desired concentrations or maintain plasma levels at the desired concentrations .
PRISMASOL and PHOXILLUM solutions are used as replacement solution to replace water and electrolytes removed during hemofiltration and hemodiafiltration .
Bicarbonate ( or precursor lactate ) in the solution is used as an alkalinizing buffer to restore acid - base balance to a clinically desirable level .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The distribution of electrolytes , bicarbonate , and dextrose is determined by the patient ' s clinical condition , metabolic status , and residual renal function .
The elimination and replacement of water , electrolytes and buffer depend on the patient ' s electrolyte and acid - base balance , metabolic status , residual renal function and ongoing physiologic losses through intestinal , respiratory and cutaneous routes .
