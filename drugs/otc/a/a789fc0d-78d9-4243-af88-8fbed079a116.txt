( 1 ) Limitations of Use : TOUJEO is not recommended for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Individualize dose based on type of diabetes , metabolic needs , blood glucose monitoring results and glycemic control goal .
( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 ) • Administer subcutaneously into the abdominal area , thigh , or deltoid once daily at any time during the day , at the same time every day .
( 2 . 1 ) • Rotate injection sites to reduce risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis .
( 2 . 1 ) • Do not dilute or mix with any other insulin or solution .
( 2 . 1 ) • See Full Prescribing Information for the recommended starting dosage in patients with type 2 diabetes and how to switch to TOUJEO from other insulins ( 2 . 3 , 2 . 4 ) • Closely monitor glucose when changing switching to TOUJEO and during initial weeks thereafter .
( 2 . 4 ) 2 . 1 Important Administration Instructions • Always check insulin labels before administration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
• Visually inspect the TOUJEO solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration and only use if the solution is clear and colorless with no visible particles .
• Inject TOUJEO subcutaneously into the abdominal area , thigh , or deltoid .
• Rotate injection sites within the same region from one injection to the next to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and localized cutaneous amyloidosis .
Do not inject into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
• Use TOUJEO with caution in patients with visual impairment who may rely on audible clicks to dial their dose .
• Do not administer TOUJEO intravenously or in an insulin pump .
• Do not dilute or mix TOUJEO with any other insulin products or solutions .
• Never transfer TOUJEO from the cartridges of the TOUJEO SoloStar or TOUJEO Max SoloStar prefilled pen into a syringe for administration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
2 . 2 General Dosing Instructions • TOUJEO is available in 2 single - patient - use prefilled pens : • TOUJEO SoloStar contains 450 units of TOUJEO U - 300 .
It delivers doses in 1 - unit increments and can deliver up to 80 units in a single injection .
• TOUJEO Max SoloStar contains 900 units of TOUJEO U - 300 .
It delivers doses in 2 - unit increments and can deliver up to 160 units in a single injection .
It is recommended for patients requiring at least 20 units per day .
• When changing between TOUJEO SoloStar and TOUJEO Max SoloStar , if the patient ' s previous dose was an odd number , the dose should be increased or decreased by 1 unit to match the dose increments dialable on each prefilled pen .
• The dose counter of the TOUJEO SoloStar or TOUJEO Max SoloStar prefilled pen shows the number of units of TOUJEO to be injected and no conversion is required .
• Inject TOUJEO subcutaneously once a day at the same time of day .
• During changes to a patient ' s insulin regimen , increase the frequency of blood glucose monitoring [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
• Individualize and titrate the dosage of TOUJEO based on the patient ' s metabolic needs , blood glucose monitoring results , and glycemic control goal .
• Titrate the dose of TOUJEO no more frequently than every 3 to 4 days .
• Dosage adjustments may be needed with changes in physical activity , changes in meal patterns ( i . e . , macronutrient content or timing of food intake ) , changes in renal or hepatic function or during acute illness to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 , 8 . 7 ) ] .
2 . 3 Starting Dose in Insulin - Naive Pediatric and Adult Patients Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes • The recommended starting dose of TOUJEO in insulin - naive patients with type 1 diabetes is approximately one - third to one - half of the total daily insulin dose .
The remainder of the total daily insulin dose should be given as a short - acting insulin and divided between each daily meal .
As a general rule , 0 . 2 to 0 . 4 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight can be used to calculate the initial total daily insulin dose in insulin - naive patients with type 1 diabetes .
• The maximum glucose lowering effect of a dose of TOUJEO may take five days to fully manifest and the first TOUJEO dose may be insufficient to cover metabolic needs in the first 24 hours of use [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
When initiating TOUJEO , monitor glucose daily .
Recommended Starting Dosage in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes • The recommended starting dose of TOUJEO in insulin - naive patients with type 2 diabetes is 0 . 2 units per kilogram of body weight once daily .
2 . 4 Starting Dose in Pediatric and Adult Patients with Either Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Already on Insulin Therapy Dosage adjustments are recommended to lower the risk of hypoglycemia when switching patients to TOUJEO from another insulin therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
• For patients currently on once - daily long or intermediate - acting insulin , start TOUJEO at the same unit dose as the once - daily long - acting insulin dose .
For patients controlled on LANTUS ( insulin glargine , 100 units / mL ) , expect that a higher daily dose of TOUJEO will be needed to maintain the same level of glycemic control [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
• For patients currently on twice - daily long or intermediate - acting insulin , start TOUJEO at 80 % of the total daily NPH or insulin detemir twice - daily dosage .
• When switching patients to TOUJEO , monitor glucose frequently in the first weeks of therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Injection : 300 units / mL ( U - 300 ) of insulin glargine available as a clear , colorless , solution in : • 1 . 5 mL TOUJEO SoloStar single - patient - use prefilled pen ( 450 units per 1 . 5 mL pen ) • 3 mL TOUJEO Max SoloStar single - patient - use prefilled pen ( 900 units per 3 mL pen ) Injection : 300 units / mL ( U - 300 ) insulin glargine in : • 1 . 5 mL TOUJEO SoloStar single - patient - use prefilled pen ( 3 ) • 3 mL TOUJEO Max SoloStar single - patient - use prefilled pen ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS TOUJEO is contraindicated : • During episodes of hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
• In patients with hypersensitivity to insulin glargine or any excipients in TOUJEO [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
• During episodes of hypoglycemia ( 4 ) • Hypersensitivity to insulin glargine or any excipients in TOUJEO ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Never share a TOUJEO SoloStar or TOUJEO Max SoloStar single - patient - use prefilled pen between patients , even if the needle is changed .
( 5 . 1 ) • Hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia with changes in insulin regimen : Make changes to a patient ' s insulin regimen ( e . g . , insulin strength , manufacturer , type , injection site , or method of administration ) under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring .
( 5 . 2 ) • Hypoglycemia : May be life - threatening .
Increase frequency of glucose monitoring with changes to : insulin dosage , concomitant drugs , meal pattern , physical activity , and in patients with renal impairment or hepatic impairment or hypoglycemia unawareness .
( 5 . 3 , 6 . 1 ) • Hypoglycemia Due to Medication errors : Accidental mix - ups between insulin products can occur .
Instruct patients to check insulin labels before injection .
( 5 . 4 ) • Hypersensitivity reactions : Severe , life - threatening , generalized allergy , including anaphylaxis , can occur .
Discontinue TOUJEO , monitor and treat if indicated .
( 5 . 5 , 6 . 1 ) • Hypokalemia : May be life - threatening .
Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk of hypokalemia and treat if indicated .
( 5 . 6 ) • Fluid retention and heart failure with concomitant use of Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) : Observe for signs and symptoms of heart failure ; consider dosage reduction or discontinuation if heart failure occurs .
( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Never Share a TOUJEO SoloStar or TOUJEO Max SoloStar Pen Between Patients TOUJEO SoloStar or TOUJEO Max SoloStar single - patient - use prefilled pens must never be shared between patients , even if the needle is changed .
Pen sharing poses a risk for transmission of blood - borne pathogens .
5 . 2 Hyperglycemia or Hypoglycemia with Changes in Insulin Regimen Changes in Insulin Regimen Including Changes to Administration Site Changes in an insulin regimen ( e . g . , insulin strength , manufacturer , type , injection site , or method of administration ) may affect glycemic control and predispose to hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] or hyperglycemia .
Repeated insulin injections into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis have been reported to result in hyperglycemia , and a sudden change in the injection site ( to unaffected area ) has been reported to result in hypoglycemia [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Make any changes to a patient ' s insulin regimen under close medical supervision with increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring .
Advise patients who have repeatedly injected into areas of lipodystrophy or localized cutaneous amyloidosis to change the injection site to unaffected areas and closely monitor for hypoglycemia .
For patients with type 2 diabetes , dosage adjustments of concomitant oral antidiabetic products may be needed .
Changing to TOUJEO from other Insulin Therapies On a unit - to - unit basis , TOUJEO has a lower glucose lowering effect than LANTUS [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
In clinical trials , patients who changed to TOUJEO from other basal insulins experienced higher average fasting plasma glucose levels in the first weeks of therapy compared to patients who were changed to LANTUS .
Higher doses of TOUJEO were required to achieve similar levels of glucose control compared to LANTUS in clinical trials [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
The onset of action of TOUJEO develops over 6 hours following an injection .
In type 1 diabetes patients treated with IV insulin , consider the longer onset of action of TOUJEO before stopping IV insulin .
The full glucose lowering effect may not be apparent for at least 5 days [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
To minimize the risk of hyperglycemia when initiating TOUJEO monitor glucose daily , titrate TOUJEO as described in this prescribing information , and adjust coadministered glucose - lowering therapies per standard of care [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 3 Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse reaction associated with insulin , including TOUJEO .
Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures , may be life - threatening , or cause death .
Hypoglycemia can impair concentration ability and reaction time ; this may place the patient and others at risk in situations where these abilities are important ( e . g . , driving , or operating other machinery ) .
Hypoglycemia can happen suddenly , and symptoms may differ in each patient and change over time in the same patient .
Symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia may be less pronounced in patients with longstanding diabetes , in patients with diabetic neuropathy , in patients using drugs that block the sympathetic nervous system ( e . g . , beta - blockers ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] , or who experience recurrent hypoglycemia .
The long - acting effect of TOUJEO may delay recovery from hypoglycemia compared to shorter - acting insulins .
Risk Factors for Hypoglycemia The timing of hypoglycemia usually reflects the time - action profile of the administered insulin formulation .
As with all insulins , the glucose lowering effect time course of TOUJEO may vary in different patients or at different times in the same patient and depends on many conditions , including the area of injection as well as the injection site blood supply and temperature [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Other factors which may increase the risk of hypoglycemia include changes in meal pattern ( e . g . , macronutrient content or timing of meals ) , changes in level of physical activity , or changes to concomitant drugs [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment may be at higher risk of hypoglycemia [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 , 8 . 7 ) ] .
Risk Mitigation Strategies for Hypoglycemia Patients and caregivers must be educated to recognize and manage hypoglycemia .
Self - monitoring of blood glucose plays an essential role in the prevention and management of hypoglycemia .
In patients at higher risk for hypoglycemia and patients who have reduced symptomatic awareness of hypoglycemia , increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring is recommended .
To minimize the risk of hypoglycemia , do not administer TOUJEO intravenously , intramuscularly or in an insulin pump , or dilute or mix TOUJEO with any other insulin products or solutions .
5 . 4 Hypoglycemia Due to Medication Errors Accidental mix - ups between insulin products have been reported .
To avoid medication errors between TOUJEO and other insulins , instruct patients to always check the insulin label before each injection .
To avoid dosing errors and potential overdose , never use a syringe to remove TOUJEO from the TOUJEO SoloStar or TOUJEO Max SoloStar prefilled pen into a syringe [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 5 Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe , life - threatening , generalized allergy , including anaphylaxis , can occur with insulins , including TOUJEO .
If hypersensitivity reactions occur , discontinue TOUJEO ; treat per standard of care and monitor until symptoms and signs resolve [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
TOUJEO is contraindicated in patients who have had hypersensitivity reactions to insulin glargine or any of the excipients in TOUJEO .
5 . 6 Hypokalemia All insulins , including TOUJEO , cause a shift in potassium from the extracellular to intracellular space , possibly leading to hypokalemia .
Untreated hypokalemia may cause respiratory paralysis , ventricular arrhythmia , and death .
Monitor potassium levels in patients at risk for hypokalemia , if indicated ( e . g . , patients using potassium - lowering medications , patients taking medications sensitive to serum potassium concentrations ) .
5 . 7 Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR - gamma Agonists Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) , which are peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor ( PPAR ) - gamma agonists , can cause dose - related fluid retention , when used in combination with insulin .
Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure .
Patients treated with insulin , including TOUJEO , and a PPAR - gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure .
If heart failure develops , it should be managed according to current standards of care , and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR - gamma agonist must be considered .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere : • Hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Hypoglycemia due to medication errors [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Hypersensitivity reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Hypokalemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] Adverse reactions commonly associated with TOUJEO ( ≥ 5 % ) are : • Hypoglycemia , allergic reactions , injection site reaction , lipodystrophy , pruritus , rash , edema , and weight gain .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates actually observed in clinical practice .
The data in Table 1 reflect the exposure of 304 patients with type 1 diabetes to TOUJEO with mean exposure duration of 23 weeks .
The type 1 diabetes population had the following characteristics : Mean age was 46 years and mean duration of diabetes was 21 years .
Fifty - five percent were male , 86 % were Caucasian , 5 % were Black or African American , and 5 % were Hispanic .
At baseline , the mean eGFR was 82 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 and 35 % of patients had eGFR ≥ 90 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 .
The mean BMI was 28 kg / m2 .
HbA1c at baseline was greater than or equal to 8 % in 58 % of patients .
The data in Table 2 reflect the exposure of 1242 patients with type 2 diabetes to TOUJEO with mean exposure duration of 25 weeks .
The type 2 diabetes population had the following characteristics : Mean age was 59 years and mean duration of diabetes was 13 years .
Fifty - three percent were male , 88 % were Caucasian , 7 % were Black or African American , and 17 % were Hispanic .
At baseline , mean eGFR was 79 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 and 27 % of patients had an eGFR ≥ 90 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 .
The mean BMI was 35 kg / m2 .
HbA1c at baseline was greater than or equal to 8 % in 66 % of patients .
TOUJEO was studied in 233 pediatric patients ( 6 – 17 years of age ) with type 1 diabetes for a mean duration of 26 weeks [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
Common adverse reactions ( occurring ≥ 5 % ) in TOUJEO - treated subjects during clinical trials in adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus are listed in Table 1 and Table 2 , respectively .
Common adverse reactions for TOUJEO - treated pediatric subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus were similar to the adverse reactions listed in Table 1 .
Hypoglycemia is discussed in a dedicated subsection below .
Table 1 : Adverse Reactions Occurring ≥ 5 % in Two Pooled Clinical Trials of 26 Weeks and 16 Weeks Duration in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes TOUJEO + Mealtime Insulin [ 1 ] , % ( n = 304 ) Nasopharyngitis 12 . 8 Upper respiratory tract infection 9 . 5 [ 1 ] " mealtime insulin " refers to insulin glulisine , insulin lispro , or insulin aspart .
Table 2 : Adverse Reactions Occurring ≥ 5 % in Three Pooled Clinical Trials of 26 Weeks Duration in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes TOUJEO [ 1 ] , % ( n = 1242 ) Nasopharyngitis 7 . 1 Upper respiratory tract infection 5 . 7 [ 1 ] one of the trials in type 2 diabetes included mealtime insulin .
Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is the most commonly observed adverse reaction in patients treated with TOUJEO .
The rates of reported hypoglycemia depend on the definition of hypoglycemia used , diabetes type , insulin dose , intensity of glucose control , background therapies , and other intrinsic and extrinsic patient factors .
For these reasons , comparing rates of hypoglycemia in clinical trials for TOUJEO with the incidence of hypoglycemia for other products may be misleading and also may not be representative of hypoglycemia rates that will occur in clinical practice .
In the TOUJEO adult program , severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event requiring assistance of another person to administer a resuscitative action .
In the pediatric program , severe hypoglycemia was defined as an event with semiconsciousness , unconsciousness , coma and / or convulsions in a patient who had altered mental status and could not assist in his own care , and who may have required glucagon or intravenous glucose .
The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in adult patients with type 1 diabetes receiving TOUJEO as part of a multiple daily injection regimen was 6 . 6 % at 26 weeks .
The incidence of hypoglycemia with a glucose level less than 54 mg / dL with or without symptoms was 77 . 7 % at 26 weeks .
The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes receiving TOUJEO as part of a multiple daily injection regimen was 6 % at 26 weeks and the incidence of hypoglycemia accompanied by a self - monitored or plasma glucose value less than 54 mg / dL regardless of symptoms was 80 . 3 % .
The incidence of severe hypoglycemia in adult patients with type 2 diabetes was 5 % at 26 weeks in patients receiving TOUJEO as part of a multiple daily injection regimen , and 1 . 0 % and 0 . 9 % respectively at 26 weeks in the two studies where patients received TOUJEO as part of a basal - insulin only regimen .
The incidence of hypoglycemia accompanied by a self - monitored or plasma glucose value less than 54 mg / dL regardless of symptoms in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving TOUJEO ranged from 9 % to 44 . 6 % at 26 weeks and the highest risk was again seen in patients receiving TOUJEO as part of a multiple daily injection regimen .
Insulin Initiation and Intensification of Glucose Control Intensification or rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a transitory , reversible ophthalmologic refraction disorder , worsening of diabetic retinopathy , and acute painful peripheral neuropathy .
However , long - term glycemic control decreases the risk of diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy .
Peripheral Edema Insulin , including TOUJEO , may cause sodium retention and edema , particularly if previously poor metabolic control was improved by intensified insulin therapy .
Lipodystrophy Long - term use of insulin , including TOUJEO , can cause lipoatrophy ( depression in the skin ) or lipohypertrophy ( enlargement or thickening of tissue ) in some patients and may affect insulin absorption [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Weight Gain Weight gain has occurred with insulins including TOUJEO and has been attributed to the anabolic effects of insulin and the decrease in glucosuria .
Hypersensitivity Reactions Patients taking TOUJEO experienced erythema , local edema , and pruritus at the site of injection .
These conditions were usually self - limiting .
Severe cases of generalized allergy ( anaphylaxis ) have been reported .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is potential for immunogenicity .
In a 6 - month study of type 1 diabetes patients , 79 % of patients who received TOUJEO once daily were positive for anti - insulin antibodies ( AIA ) at least once during the study , including 62 % that were positive at baseline and 44 % of patients who developed antidrug antibody ( i . e . , anti - insulin glargine antibody [ ADA ] ) during the study .
Eighty percent of the AIA - positive patients on TOUJEO with antibody test at baseline remained AIA positive at month 6 .
In two 6 - month studies in type 2 diabetes patients , 25 % of patients who received TOUJEO once daily were positive for AIA at least once during the study , including 42 % who were positive at baseline and 20 % of patients who developed ADA during the study .
Ninety percent of the AIA - positive patients on TOUJEO with antibody test at baseline , remained AIA positive at month 6 .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and may be influenced by several factors such as : assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medication , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies to TOUJEO with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of TOUJEO .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Localized cutaneous amyloidosis at the injection site has occurred .
Hyperglycemia has been reported with repeated insulin injections into areas of localized cutaneous amyloidosis ; hypoglycemia has been reported with a sudden change to an unaffected injection site .

Drugs That May Blunt Signs and Symptoms of Hypoglycemia Drugs : Beta - blockers , clonidine , guanethidine , and reserpine .
Intervention : Increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required when TOUJEO is coadministered with these drugs .
• Drugs that Affect Glucose Metabolism : Adjustment of insulin dosage may be needed .
( 7 ) • Antiadrenergic Drugs ( e . g . , beta - blockers , clonidine , guanethidine , and reserpine ) : Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent .
( 5 . 3 , 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Published studies with use of insulin glargine during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with insulin glargine and adverse developmental outcomes ( see Data ) .
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
Rats and rabbits were exposed to insulin glargine in animal reproduction studies during organogenesis , respectively 50 times and 10 times the human subcutaneous dose of 0 . 2 unit / kg / day .
Overall , the effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin ( see Data ) .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 % to 10 % in women with pregestational diabetes with a peri - conceptional HbA1c > 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 % to 25 % in women with a peri - conceptional HbA1c > 10 .
The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
Clinical Considerations Disease - Associated Maternal and / or Embryo / fetal Risk Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia occur more frequently during pregnancy in patients with pre - gestational diabetes .
Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis , preeclampsia , spontaneous abortions , preterm delivery , and delivery complications .
Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects , stillbirth , and macrosomia - related morbidity .
Data Human Data Published data do not report a clear association with insulin glargine and major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when insulin glargine is used during pregnancy .
However , these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations including small sample size and some lacking comparator groups .
Animal Data Subcutaneous reproduction and teratology studies have been performed with insulin glargine and regular human insulin in rats and Himalayan rabbits .
Insulin glargine was given to female rats before mating , during mating , and throughout pregnancy at doses up to 0 . 36 mg / kg / day , which is approximately 50 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0 . 2 Units / kg / day ( 0 . 007 mg / kg / day ) .
In rabbits , doses of 0 . 072 mg / kg / day , which is approximately 10 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0 . 2 Units / kg / day ( 0 . 007 mg / kg / day ) , were administered during organogenesis .
The effects of insulin glargine did not generally differ from those observed with regular human insulin in rats or rabbits .
However , in rabbits , five fetuses from two litters of the high - dose group exhibited dilation of the cerebral ventricles .
Fertility and early embryonic development appeared normal .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are either no or only limited data on the presence of insulin glargine in human milk , the effects on breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Endogenous insulin is present in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for TOUJEO , and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from TOUJEO or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of TOUJEO to improve glycemic control in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with diabetes mellitus have been established .
The use of TOUJEO for this indication is supported by evidence from an adequate and well - controlled study in 463 pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age with type 1 diabetes mellitus [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] and from studies in adults with diabetes mellitus [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of TOUJEO have not been established in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In controlled clinical studies , 30 of 304 ( 9 . 8 % ) TOUJEO - treated patients with type 1 diabetes and 327 of 1242 ( 26 . 3 % ) TOUJEO - treated patients with type 2 diabetes were ≥ 65 years of age , among them 2 . 0 % of the patients with type 1 and 3 . 0 % of the patients with type 2 diabetes were ≥ 75 years of age .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of TOUJEO have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger adult patients .
Nevertheless , caution should be exercised when TOUJEO is administered to geriatric patients .
In geriatric patients with diabetes , the initial dosing , dose increments , and maintenance dosage should be conservative to avoid hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment The effect of kidney impairment on the pharmacokinetics of TOUJEO has not been studied .
Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with kidney failure .
Frequent glucose monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary for TOUJEO in patients with kidney impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of TOUJEO has not been studied .
Frequent glucose monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary for TOUJEO in patients with hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Excess insulin administration may cause hypoglycemia and hypokalemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 , 5 . 6 ) ] .
Mild episodes of hypoglycemia can be treated with oral glucose .
Lowering the insulin dosage , and adjustments in meal patterns , or physical activity level may be needed .
More severe episodes of hypoglycemia with coma , seizure , or neurologic impairment may be treated with glucagon for emergency use or concentrated intravenous glucose .
Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery .
Hypokalemia must be corrected appropriately .
11 DESCRIPTION Insulin glargine is a long - acting human insulin analog produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a nonpathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli ( K12 ) as the production organism .
Insulin glargine differs from human insulin in that the amino acid asparagine at position A21 is replaced by glycine and two arginines remain at the C - terminus of the B - chain .
Insulin glargine has a molecular weight of 6063 Da .
TOUJEO ( insulin glargine ) injection is a sterile , clear and colorless solution for subcutaneous injection .
Each mL of TOUJEO contains 300 units of insulin glargine dissolved in a clear aqueous fluid .
The 1 . 5 mL TOUJEO SoloStar prefilled pen presentation contains the following inactive ingredients per mL : glycerin ( 20 mg ) , metacresol ( 2 . 7 mg ) , zinc ( 90 mcg ) , and Water for Injection , USP .
The 3 mL TOUJEO Max SoloStar prefilled pen presentation contains the following inactive ingredients per mL : glycerin ( 20 mg ) , metacresol ( 2 . 7 mg ) , zinc ( 90 mcg ) , and Water for Injection , USP .
The pH is adjusted by addition of aqueous solutions of hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide .
TOUJEO has a pH of approximately 4 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The primary activity of insulin , including insulin glargine , is regulation of glucose metabolism .
Insulin and its analogs lower blood glucose by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake , especially by skeletal muscle and fat , and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production .
Insulin inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Onset of Action The pharmacodynamic profiles for TOUJEO given subcutaneously as a single dose of 0 . 4 , 0 . 6 , or 0 . 9 U / kg in a euglycemic clamp study in patients with type 1 diabetes showed that on average , the onset of action develops over 6 hours post dose for all three single doses of TOUJEO .
Single - Dose Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics for single 0 . 4 , 0 . 6 , and 0 . 9 U / kg doses of TOUJEO in 24 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in a euglycemic clamp study .
On a unit - to - unit basis , TOUJEO had a lower maximum ( GIRmax ) and 24 - hour glucose lowering effect ( GIR - AUC0 – 24 ) compared to LANTUS .
The overall glucose lowering effect of TOUJEO 0 . 4 U / kg was 12 % of the glucose lowering effect of an equivalent dose of LANTUS .
Glucose lowering at least 30 % of the effect of a single 0 . 4 U / kg dose of LANTUS was not observed until the single dose of TOUJEO exceeded 0 . 6 U / kg .
Multiple Once - Daily Dose Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of TOUJEO after 8 days of daily injection was evaluated in 30 patients with type 1 diabetes .
At steady state , the 24 - hour glucose lowering effect ( GIR - AUC0 – 24 ) of TOUJEO 0 . 4 U / kg was approximately 27 % lower with a different distribution profile than that of an equivalent dose of LANTUS [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The glucose lowering effect of a TOUJEO dose increased with each daily administration .
The pharmacodynamic profile for TOUJEO given subcutaneously as multiple once - daily subcutaneous injections of 0 . 4 U / kg in a euglycemic clamp study in patients with type 1 diabetes is shown in Figure 1 .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The pharmacokinetic profiles for single 0 . 4 , 0 . 6 , and 0 . 9 U / kg doses of TOUJEO in 24 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus was evaluated in a euglycemic clamp study .
The median time to maximum serum insulin concentration was 12 ( 8 – 14 ) , 12 ( 12 – 18 ) , and 16 ( 12 – 20 ) hours , respectively .
Mean serum insulin concentrations declined to the lower limit of quantitation of 5 . 02 µU / mL by 16 , 28 , and beyond 36 hours , respectively .
Steady - state insulin concentrations are reached by at least 5 days of once - daily subcutaneous administration of 0 . 4 U / kg to 0 . 6 U / kg doses of TOUJEO over 8 days in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus .
After subcutaneous injection of TOUJEO , the intra - subject variability , defined as the coefficient of variation for the insulin exposure during 24 hours , was 21 . 0 % at steady state .
Elimination After subcutaneous injection of TOUJEO in diabetic patients , insulin glargine is metabolized at the carboxyl terminus of the B - chain with formation of two active metabolites M1 ( 21 A - Gly - insulin ) and M2 ( 21 A - Gly - des - 30 B - Thr - insulin ) .
The in vitro activity of M1 and M2 were similar to that of human insulin .
Specific Populations Pediatrics Population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted for TOUJEO based on concentration data of its main metabolite M1 using data from 75 pediatric patients ( 6 to < 18 years of age ) with type 1 diabetes .
The findings with regard to the effect of body weight on systemic exposure of M1 are generally consistent with findings in adults .
Elderly , Race , Sex , and Obesity Effect of age ≥ 65 , race , and sex on the pharmacokinetics of TOUJEO has not been evaluated .
When weight is taken into account as a covariate on clearance , BMI is not an additional covariate .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In mice and rats , standard two - year carcinogenicity studies with insulin glargine were performed at doses up to 0 . 455 mg / kg , which was for the rat approximately 65 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dosage of 0 . 2 Units / kg / day ( 0 . 007 mg / kg / day ) .
The findings in female mice were not conclusive due to excessive mortality in all dose groups during the study .
Histiocytomas were found at injection sites in male rats ( statistically significant ) and male mice ( not statistically significant ) in acid vehicle containing groups .
These tumors were not found in female animals , in saline control , or insulin comparator groups using a different vehicle .
The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown .
Insulin glargine was not mutagenic in tests for detection of gene mutations in bacteria and mammalian cells ( Ames and HGPRT test ) and in tests for detection of chromosomal aberrations ( cytogenetics in vitro in V79 cells and in vivo in Chinese hamsters ) .
In a combined fertility and prenatal and postnatal study in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 0 . 36 mg / kg / day , which was approximately 50 times the recommended human subcutaneous starting dose of 0 . 2 Units / kg / day ( 0 . 007 mg / kg / day ) , maternal toxicity due to dose - dependent hypoglycemia , including some deaths , was observed .
Consequently , a reduction of the rearing rate occurred in the high - dose group only .
Similar effects were observed with NPH insulin .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Overview of Clinical Studies The safety and effectiveness of TOUJEO given once daily was compared to that of once - daily LANTUS in 26 - week , open - label , randomized , active - control , parallel studies of 546 adult patients and 463 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 2 , 474 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( Tables 4 and 5 ) .
At trial end , the reduction in glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) and fasting plasma glucose with TOUJEO titrated to goal was similar to that with LANTUS titrated to goal .
At the end of the trial , depending on the patient population and concomitant therapy , patients were receiving a higher dose of TOUJEO than LANTUS .
14 . 2 Clinical Study in Adult and Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Adult Patients with Type 1 Diabetes In an open - label , controlled study ( Study A ) , patients with type 1 diabetes ( n = 546 ) , were randomized to basal - bolus treatment with TOUJEO or LANTUS and treated for 26 weeks .
TOUJEO and LANTUS were administered once daily in the morning ( time period covering from pre - breakfast until pre - lunch ) or in the evening ( time period defined as prior to the evening meal until at bedtime ) .
A mealtime insulin analogue was administered before each meal .
Mean age was 47 years and mean duration of diabetes was 21 years .
Fifty - seven percent were male , 85 % were Caucasian , 5 % Black or African American , and 5 % were Hispanic ; 32 % of patients had GFR > 90 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 .
The mean BMI was approximately 27 . 6 kg / m2 .
At week 26 , treatment with TOUJEO provided a mean reduction in HbA1c that met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0 . 4 % ( Table 4 ) .
Patients treated with TOUJEO used 18 % more basal insulin than patients treated with LANTUS .
There were no clinically important differences in glycemic control when TOUJEO was administered once daily in the morning or in the evening .
There were no clinically important differences in body weight between treatment groups .

Cardiovascular Safety No clinical studies to establish the cardiovascular safety of TOUJEO have been conducted .
A cardiovascular outcomes trial , ORIGIN , has been conducted with LANTUS .
It is unknown whether the results of ORIGIN can be applied to TOUJEO .
The Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention trial ( i . e . , ORIGIN ) was an open - label , randomized , 12 , 537 patient study that compared LANTUS to standard care on the time to first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) .
MACE was defined as the composite of CV death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , and nonfatal stroke .
The incidence of MACE was similar between LANTUS and standard care in ORIGIN ( Hazard Ratio [ 95 % CI ] for MACE ; 1 . 02 [ 0 . 94 , 1 . 11 ] ) .
In the ORIGIN trial , the overall incidence of cancer ( all types combined ) ( Hazard Ratio [ 95 % CI ] ; 0 . 99 [ 0 . 88 , 1 . 11 ] ) or death from cancer ( Hazard Ratio [ 95 % CI ] ; 0 . 94 [ 0 . 77 , 1 . 15 ] ) was also similar between treatment groups .

• Do not re - use needles .
Always use a new needle for each injection .
Reusing needles increases your chance of having blocked needles , which can cause you to get the wrong dose of TOUJEO .
Using a new needle for each injection also lowers your risk of getting an infection .
If your needle is blocked , follow the instructions in Step 3 of the Instructions for Use .
• TOUJEO should be used 1 time each day and at the same time each day .
• TOUJEO is injected under the skin ( subcutaneously ) of your upper legs ( thighs ) , upper arms , or stomach area ( abdomen ) .
• Do not use TOUJEO in an insulin pump or inject TOUJEO into your vein ( intravenously ) .
• Change ( rotate ) your injection sites within the area you choose with each dose to reduce your risk of getting pits or thickening of the skin ( lipodystrophy ) and lumps in the skin ( localized cutaneous amyloidosis ) at the injection sites .
• Do not use the exact same spot for each injection .
• Do not inject where the skin has pits , is thickened , or has lumps .
• Do not inject where the skin is tender , bruised , scaly or hard , or into scars or damaged skin .
• Do not mix TOUJEO with any other type of insulin or liquid medicine .
