( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data have not established an association with metronidazole use during pregnancy and major birth defects , miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
No fetotoxicity was observed after oral administration of metronidazole in pregnant rats or mice .
The available data do not allow the calculation of relevant comparisons between the systemic exposures of metronidazole observed in animal studies to the systemic exposures that would be expected in humans after topical use of metronidazole .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether metronidazole is present in human milk after topical administration .
Published literature reports the presence of metronidazole in human milk after oral administration .
There are reports of diarrhea and candida infection in breastfed infants of mothers receiving oral treatment with metronidazole .
There are no data on the effects of metronidazole on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions , advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with metronidazole gel .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Sixty - six subjects aged 65 years and older were treated with metronidazole gel in the clinical study .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
11 DESCRIPTION Metronidazole Gel USP , 1 % contains metronidazole , USP .
It is intended for topical use .
Chemically , metronidazole is 2 - methyl - 5 - nitro - 1 H - imidazole - 1 - ethanol .
The molecular formula for metronidazole is C6H9N3O3 .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Metronidazole has a molecular weight of 171 . 16 .
It is a white to pale yellow crystalline powder .
It is slightly soluble in alcohol and has solubility in water of 10 mg / mL at 20 ° C . Metronidazole belongs to the nitroimidazole class of compounds .
Metronidazole is a colorless to slightly yellow gel ; each gram contains 10 mg of metronidazole in a base of alcohol ( 9 . 3 % w / w ) , edetate disodium , hydroxyethylcellulose , polyethylene glycol 400 , propylene glycol , sorbic acid , and purified water .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of metronidazole in the treatment of rosacea is unknown .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of metronidazole in association with the treatment of rosacea are unknown .
Cardiac Electrophysiology : The effect of metronidazole on the QTc interval has not been adequately characterized .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Topical administration of a one - gram dose of metronidazole gel to the face of 13 subjects with moderate to severe rosacea once daily for 7 days resulted in a mean ± SD Cmax of metronidazole of 32 ± 9 ng / mL .
The mean ± SD AUC ( 0 - 24 ) was 595 ± 154 ng * hr / mL .
The mean Cmax and AUC ( 0 - 24 ) are less than 1 % of the value reported for a single 250 mg oral dose of metronidazole .
The time to maximum plasma concentration ( Tmax ) was 6 to 10 hours after topical application .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Metronidazole has shown evidence of carcinogenic activity in studies involving chronic oral administration in mice and rats , but not in studies involving hamsters .
In several long - term studies in mice , oral doses of approximately 225 mg / m2 / day or greater were associated with an increase in pulmonary tumors and lymphomas .
Several long - term oral studies in the rat have shown statistically significant increases in mammary and hepatic tumors at doses > 885 mg / m2 / day .
Metronidazole has shown evidence of mutagenic activity in several in vitro bacterial assay systems .
In addition , a dose - related increase in the frequency of micronuclei was observed in mice after intraperitoneal injections .
An increase in chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes was reported in patients with Crohn ' s disease who were treated with 200 to 1200 mg / day of metronidazole for 1 to 24 months .
However , in another study , no increase in chromosomal aberrations in circulating lymphocytes was observed in patients with Crohn ' s disease treated with the drug for 8 months .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES In a randomized , vehicle - controlled trial , 746 subjects with rosacea were treated with metronidazole gel or vehicle once daily for 10 weeks .
Most subjects had a disease severity score of 3 ( " moderate " ) on the 5 - point Investigator Global Assessment ( IGA ) scale , with 8 to 50 inflammatory lesions and no more than two nodules at baseline .
The co - primary efficacy endpoints were the percent reduction in inflammatory lesion counts and percentage of subjects with success on IGA , defined as an IGA score of 0 ( " clear " ) or 1 ( " almost clear " ) at Week 10 .
The efficacy results are shown in the following table : Table 3 : Inflammatory Lesion Counts and Global Scores in a Clinical Trial of Rosacea Metronidazole Gel Vehicle N Results N ( % ) N Results N ( % ) Inflammatory lesions 557 189 Baseline , mean count 18 . 3 18 . 4 Week - 10 , mean count 8 . 9 12 . 8 Reduction 9 . 4 ( 50 . 7 ) 5 . 6 ( 32 . 6 ) Investigator Global Assessment 557 189 Subject clear or almost clear 214 ( 38 . 42 ) 52 ( 27 . 51 ) Subject with no change 159 ( 28 . 5 ) 77 ( 40 . 7 ) Subjects treated with metronidazole gel experienced a mean reduction of 9 . 4 inflammatory lesions in the Week - 10 LOCF group , compared to a reduction of 5 . 6 for those treated with vehicle , or a difference in means of 3 . 8 lesions .
The contribution to efficacy of individual components of the vehicle has not been established .
