[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] WARNING : ENDOMETRIAL CANCER , CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS , PROBABLE DEMENTIA , and BREAST CANCER WARNING : ENDOMETRIAL CANCER , CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS , PROBABLE DEMENTIA and BREAST CANCER Estrogen - Alone Therapy Endometrial Cancer There is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens .
Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia , which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer .
Use adequate diagnostic measures , including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated , to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Cardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia Do not use estrogen - alone therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 , 14 . 3 ) ] .
The Women ' s Health Initiative ( WHI ) estrogen - alone substudy reported increased risks of stroke and deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) in postmenopausal women ( 50 to 79 years of age ) during 7 . 1 years of treatment with daily oral conjugated estrogens ( CE ) [ 0 . 625 mg ] - alone , relative to placebo [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Clinical Stuides ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The WHI Memory Study ( WHIMS ) estrogen - alone ancillary study of WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 5 . 2 years of treatment with daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone , relative to placebo .
It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Only daily oral 0 . 625 mg CE was studied in the estrogen - alone substudy of the WHI .
Therefore , the relevance of the WHI findings regarding adverse cardiovascular events and dementia to lower CE doses , other routes of administration , or other estrogen - alone products is not known .
Without such data , it is not possible to definitively exclude these risks or determine the extent of these risks for other products .
Discuss with your patient the benefits and risks of estrogen - alone therapy , taking into account her individual risk profile .
Prescribe estrogens with or without progestins at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman .
Estrogen Plus Progestin Therapy Cardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia Do not use estrogen plus progestin therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 , 14 . 3 ) ] .
The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported increased risks of DVT , pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , stroke and myocardial infarction ( MI ) in postmenopausal women ( 50 to 79 years of age ) during 5 . 6 years of treatment with daily oral CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA ) [ 2 . 5 mg ] , relative to placebo [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of the WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 4 years of treatment with daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) combined with MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) , relative to placebo .
It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Breast Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy also demonstrated an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Only daily oral 0 . 625 mg CE and 2 . 5 mg MPA were studied in the estrogen plus progestin substudy of the WHI .
Therefore , the relevance of the WHI findings regarding adverse cardiovascular events , dementia and breast cancer to lower CE plus other MPA doses , other routes of administration , or other estrogen plus progestin products is not known .
Without such data , it is not possible to definitively exclude these risks or determine the extent of these risks for other products .
Discuss with your patient the benefits and risks of estrogen plus progestin therapy , taking into account her individual risk profile .
Prescribe estrogens with or without progestins at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman .

Estrogen - Alone Therapy • There is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens ( 5 . 2 ) • Estrogen - alone therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 ) • The Women ' s Health Initiative ( WHI ) estrogen - alone substudy reported increased risks of stroke and deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) ( 5 . 1 ) • The WHI Memory Study ( WHIMS ) estrogen - alone ancillary study of WHI reported an increased risk of probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older ( 5 . 3 ) Estrogen Plus Progestin Therapy • Estrogen plus progestin therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 ) • The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported increased risks of stroke , DVT , pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , and myocardial infarction ( MI ) ( 5 . 1 ) • The WHI estrogen plus progestin study reported increased risks of invasive breast cancer ( 5 . 2 ) • The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI reported an increased risk of probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older ( 5 . 3 ) RECENT MAJOR CHANGES Boxed Warning ......................................................................................... 12 / 2019 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Estradiol gel 0 . 1 % is an estrogen indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause ( 1 . 1 ) .
1 . 1 Treatment of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms due to Menopause 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Generally , when estrogen is prescribed for a postmenopausal woman with a uterus , consider addition of a progestin to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer .
A woman who takes estrogen but does not have a uterus , generally does not need a progestin .
In some cases , however , hysterectomized women who have a history of endometriosis may need a progestin [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 14 ) ] .
Use estrogen - alone , or in combination with a progestin , at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman .
Reevaluate postmenopausal women periodically as clinically appropriate to determine if treatment is still necessary .
Daily administration of 0 . 25 to 1 . 25 grams of estradiol gel 0 . 1 % to the right or left upper thigh on alternating days .
Women should be started with the lowest effective dose and the dose should be evaluated periodically ( 2 ) .
2 . 1 Treatment of Moderate to Severe Vasomotor Symptoms due to Menopause Start therapy with the 0 . 25 grams applied once daily on the skin of either the right or left upper thigh .
Adjust the dose up to a maximum of 1 . 25 grams , as needed .
The application surface area should be about 5 by 7 inches ( approximately the size of two palm prints ) .
The entire contents of a unit dose packet should be applied each day .
To avoid potential skin irritation , apply estradiol gel 0 . 1 % to the right or left upper thigh on alternating days .

( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Estradiol gel 0 . 1 % is contraindicated in women with any of the following conditions : • Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Breast cancer or history of breast cancer [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Estrogen - dependent neoplasia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Active DVT , PE , or history of these conditions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Active arterial thromboembolic disease ( e . g , stroke and MI ) , or a history of these conditions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Known anaphylactic reaction , angioedema , or hypersensitivity to estradiol gel 0 . 1 % • Hepatic impairment or disease • Protein C , protein S , or antithrombin deficiency , or other known thrombophilic disorders • Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding ( 4 ) • Breast cancer or a history of breast cancer ( 4 , 5 . 2 ) • Estrogen - dependent neoplasia ( 4 , 5 . 2 ) • Active DVT , PE , or history of these conditions ( 4 , 5 . 1 ) • Active arterial thromboembolic disease ( e . g . , stroke and MI ) , or history of these conditions ( 4 , 5 . 1 ) • Known anaphylactic reaction , angioedema , or hypersensitivity to estradiol gel 0 . 1 % ( 4 ) • Hepatic impairment or disease ( 4 , 5 . 10 ) • Protein C , protein S , or antithrombin deficiency , or other known thrombophilic disorders ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Estrogens increase the risk of gallbladder disease ( 5 . 4 ) • Discontinue estrogen if severe hypercalcemia , loss of vision , severe hypertriglyceridemia or cholestatic jaundice occurs ( 5 . 5 , 5 . 6 , 5 . 9 , 5 . 10 ) • Monitor thyroid function in women on thyroid replacement therapy ( 5 . 11 , 5 . 22 ) 5 . 1 Cardiovascular Disorders Increased risk of stroke and DVT are reported with estrogen - alone therapy .
Increased risk of PE , DVT , stroke and MI are reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy .
Immediately discontinue estrogen with or without progestin therapy if any of these occur or is suspected .
Manage appropriately any risk factors for arterial vascular disease ( e . g . , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , tobacco use , hypercholesterolemia , and obesity ) and / or venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) ( e . g . , personal history or family history of VTE , obesity , and systemic lupus erythematosus ) .
Stroke The WHI estrogen - alone substudy reported a statistically significant increased risk of stroke in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo ( 45 versus 33 strokes per 10 , 000 women - years , respectively ) .
The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and persisted [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Immediately discontinue estrogen - alone therapy if a stroke occurs or is suspected .
Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone versus those receiving placebo ( 18 versus 21 per 10 , 000 women - years ) . 1 The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo ( 33 versus 25 per 10 , 000 women - years ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted . 1 Immediately discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy if a stroke occurs or is suspected .
Coronary Heart Disease The WHI estrogen - alone substudy reported no overall effect on coronary heart disease ( CHD ) events ( defined as nonfatal MI , silent MI , or CHD death ) in women receiving estrogen - alone compared to placebo2 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest a statistically non - significant reduction in CHD events ( CE [ 0 . 625 mg ] - alone compared to placebo ) in women with less than 10 years since menopause ( 8 versus 16 per 10 , 000 women - years ) . 1 The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non - significant increased risk of CHD events reported in women receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) compared to women receiving placebo ( 41 versus 34 per 10 , 000 women - years ) . 1 An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1 , and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease ( n = 2 , 763 , average 66 . 7 years of age ) , in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [ Heart and Estrogen / Progestin Replacement Study ( HERS ) ] , treatment with daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit .
During an average follow - up of 4 . 1 years , treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease .
There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA - treated group than in the placebo group in year 1 , but not during the subsequent years .
Two thousand , three hundred and twenty - one ( 2 , 321 ) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS , HERS II .
Average follow - up in HERS II was an additional 2 . 7 years , for a total of 6 . 8 years overall .
Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS , HERS II , and overall .
Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen - alone substudy , the risk of VTE ( DVT and PE ) was increased for women receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone compared to placebo ( 30 versus 22 per 10 , 000 women - years ) , although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance ( 23 versus 15 per 10 , 000 women - years ) .
The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years 3 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Immediately discontinue estrogen - alone therapy if a VTE occurs or is suspected .
In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy , a statistically significant 2 - fold greater rate of VTE was reported in women receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) compared to women receiving placebo ( 35 versus 17 per 10 , 000 women - years ) .
Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT ( 26 versus 13 per 10 , 000 women - years ) and PE ( 18 versus 8 per 10 , 000 women - years ) were also demonstrated .
The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted 4 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Immediately discontinue estrogen plus progestin therapy if a VTE occurs or is suspected .
If feasible , discontinue estrogens at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism , or during periods of prolonged immobilization .
5 . 2 Malignant Neoplasms Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus .
The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non - users , and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose .
Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year .
The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use , with increased risk of 15 - to 24 - fold for 5 to 10 years or more and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued .
Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen - alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy is important .
Undertake adequate diagnostic measures , including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated , to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding with unknown etiology .
There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose .
Adding a progestin to postmenopausal estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia , which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer .
Breast Cancer The WHI substudy of daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone provided information about breast cancer in estrogen - alone users .
In the WHI estrogen - alone substudy , after an average follow - up of 7 . 1 years , daily CE - alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [ relative risk ( RR ) 0 . 80 ] 5 compared to placebo [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
After a mean follow - up of 5 . 6 years , the WHI substudy of daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA compared to placebo .
In this substudy , prior use of estrogen - alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women .
The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1 . 24 , and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10 , 000 women - years , for CE plus MPA compared with placebo .
Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy , the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1 . 86 , and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10 , 000 women - years , for CE plus MPA compared with placebo .
Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy , the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1 . 09 , and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10 , 000 women - years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo .
In the same substudy , invasive breast cancers were larger , were more likely to be node positive , and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) group compared with the placebo group .
Metastatic disease was rare , with no apparent difference between the two groups .
Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype , grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups 6 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Consistent with the WHI clinical trial , observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer with estrogen plus progestin therapy , and a smaller increase in the risk for breast cancer with estrogen - alone therapy , after several years of use .
The risk increased with duration of use , and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment ( only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping ) .
Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater , and became apparent earlier , with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen - alone therapy .
These studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations , doses , or routes of administration .
The use of estrogen - alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation .
All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self - examinations .
In addition , mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age , risk factors , and prior mammogram results .
Ovarian Cancer The CE plus MPA substudy of WHI reported that estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of ovarian cancer .
After an average follow - up of 5 . 6 years , the relative risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1 . 58 [ 95 percent CI , 0 . 77 – 3 . 24 but was not statistically significant ] .
The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10 , 000 women - years . 7 A meta - analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer .
The primary analysis , using case - control comparisons , included 12 , 110 cancer cases from the 17 prospective studies .
The relative risks associated with current use of hormonal therapy was 1 . 41 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1 . 32 to 1 . 50 ) ; there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure ( less than 5 years [ median of 3 years ] vs . greater than 5 years [ median of 10 years ] of use before the cancer diagnosis ) .
The relative risk associated with combined current and recent use ( discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis ) was 1 . 37 ( 95 % CI 1 . 27 - 1 . 48 ) , and the elevated risk was significant for both estrogen - alone and estrogen plus progestin products .
The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer , however , is unknown .
5 . 3 Probable Dementia In the WHI Memory Study ( WHIMS ) estrogen - alone ancillay study , a population of 2 , 947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone or placebo .
After an average follow - up of 5 . 2 years , 28 women in the estrogen - alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia .
The relative risk of probable dementia for CE - alone versus placebo was 1 . 49 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 83 – 2 . 66 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE - alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10 , 000 women - years 8 [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study , a population of 4 , 532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) or placebo .
After an average follow - up of 4 years , 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia .
The relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2 . 05 ( 95 percent CI , 1 . 21 – 3 . 48 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10 , 000 women - years 8 [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen - alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol , the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1 . 76 ( 95 percent CI , 1 . 19 – 2 . 60 ) .
Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age , it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women 8 [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 4 Gallbladder Disease A 2 - to 4 - fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported .
5 . 5 Hypercalcemia Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in women with breast cancer and bone metastases .
Discontinue estrogens , including estradiol gel 0 . 1 % , if hypercalcemia occurs , and take appropriate measures to reduce the serum calcium level .
5 . 6 Visual Abnormalities Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogens .
Discontinue estrogens pending examination if there is sudden partial or complete loss of vision , or a sudden onset of proptosis , diplopia , or migraine .
Discontinue estrogens , including estadiol gel 0 . 1 % , if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions .
5 . 7 Addition of a Progestin When a Woman Has Not Had a Hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration , or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen , have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone .
Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer .
There are , however , possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen - alone regimens .
These include an increased risk of breast cancer .
5 . 8 Elevated Blood Pressure In a small number of case reports , substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens .
In a large , randomized , placebo - controlled clinical trial , a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen .
5 . 9 Exacerbation of Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre - existing hypertriglyceridemia , estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis .
Consider discontinuation of estradiol gel 0 . 1 % if pancreatitis occurs .
5 . 10 Hepatic Impairment and / or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with hepatic impairment .
For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy , caution should be exercised , and in the case of recurrence of cholestatic jaundice , discontinue estradiol gel 0 . 1 % .
5 . 11 Exacerbation of Hypothyroidism Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid - binding globulin ( TBG ) levels .
Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone , thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range .
Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy .
Monitor thyroid function in these women during treatment with estradiol gel , 0 . 1 % to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range .
5 . 12 Fluid Retention Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention .
Monitor any woman with a condition ( s ) that might predispose her to fluid retention , such as a cardiac or renal dysfunction .
Discontinue estrogen - alone therapy with evidence of medically concerning fluid retention .
5 . 13 Hypocalcemia Estrogen - induced hypocalcemia may occur in women with hypoparathyroidism .
Consider whether the benefits of estrogen therapy outweigh the risks in such women .
5 . 14 Exacerbation of Endometriosis A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post - hysterectomy with estrogen - alone therapy .
Consider the addition of a progestin for women known to have residual endometriosis post - hysterectomy .
5 . 15 Hereditary Angioedema Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema .
Consider whether the benefits of estrogen therapy outweigh the risks in such women .
5 . 16 Exacerbation of Other Conditions Estrogen therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma , diabetes mellitus , epilepsy , migraine , porphyria , systemic lupus erythematosus , and hepatic hemangiomas .
Consider whether the benefits of estrogen therapy outweigh the risks in such women .
5 . 17 Photosensitivity The effects of direct sun exposure to estradiol gel 0 . 1 % application sites have not been evaluated in clinical trials .
5 . 18 Application of Sunscreen and Topical Solutions Studies conducted using other approved topical estrogen gel products have shown that sunscreens have the potential for changing the systemic exposure of topically applied estrogen gels .
The effect of sunscreens and other topical lotions on the systemic exposure of estradiol gel 0 . 1 % has not been evaluated in clinical trials .
5 . 19 Flammability of Alcohol - Based Gels Alcohol based gels are flammable .
Avoid fire , flame , or smoking until the gel has dried .
Occlusion of the area where the topical drug product is applied with clothing or other barriers is not recommended until the gel is completely dried .
5 . 20 Potential for Estradiol Transfer and Effects of Washing There is a potential for drug transfer from one individual to the other following physical contact of estradiol gel 0 . 1 % application sites .
In a study to evaluate transferability to males from their female contacts , there was some elevation of estradiol levels over baseline in the male subjects ; however , the degree of transferability in this study was inconclusive .
Women are advised to avoid skin contact with other persons until the gel is completely dried .
The site of application should be covered ( clothed ) after drying .
Washing the application site with soap and water 1 hour after application resulted in a 30 to 38 percent decrease in the mean total 24 - hour exposure to estradiol .
Therefore , women should refrain from washing the application site for at least one hour after application .
5 . 21 Laboratory Tests Serum follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms 5 . 22 Drug - Laboratory Test Interactions • Accelerated prothrombin time , partial thromboplastin time , and platelet aggregation time ; increased platelet count ; increased factors II , VII antigen , VIII antigen , VIII coagulant activity , IX , X , XII , VII - X complex , II - VII - X complex , and beta - thromboglobulin ; decreased levels of anti - factor Xa and antithrombin III , decreased antithrombin III activity ; increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity ; increased plasminogen antigen and activity .
• Increased thyroid binding globulin ( TBG ) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels , as measured by protein - bound iodine ( PBI ) , T 4 levels ( by column or by radioimmunoassay ) or T 3 levels by radioimmunoassay .
T 3 resin uptake is decreased , reflecting the elevated TBG .
Free T 4 and free T 3 concentrations are unaltered .
Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone .
• Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum , for example , corticosteroid binding globulin ( CBG ) , sex hormone - binding globulin ( SHBG ) , leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids , respectively .
Free hormone concentrations , such as testosterone and estradiol , may be decreased .
Other plasma proteins may be increased ( angiotensinogen / renin substrate , alpha - l - antitrypsin , ceruloplasmin ) .
• Increased plasma high - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) and HDL 2 cholesterol subfraction concentrations , reduced low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol concentration , increased triglyceride levels .
• Impaired glucose tolerance .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling : • Cardiovascular Disorders [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
• Malignant Neoplasms [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
The most common adverse reactions ( incidence > 5 percent and greater than placebo ) in any estradiol gel 0 . 1 % treatment group are metrorrhagia , breast tenderness , vaginal mycosis , nasopharyngitis , and upper respiratory tract infection ( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Xiromed , LLC .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Estradiol gel 0 . 1 % was studied at doses of 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 and 1 . 0 gram per day in a 12 - week , double - blind , placebo - controlled study that included a total of 495 postmenopausal women ( 86 . 5 percent Caucasian ) .
The adverse events that occurred at a rate greater than 5 percent and greater than placebo in any of the treatment groups are summarized in Table 1 .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of estradiol gel 0 . 1 % .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Genitourinary System Amenorrhea , dysmenorrhea , ovarian cyst , vaginal discharge Breasts Gynecomastia Cardiovascular Palpitations , ventricular extrasystoles Gastrointestinal Flatulence Skin Rash pruritic , urticaria Eyes Retinal vein occlusion Central Nervous System Tremor Miscellaneous Arthralgia , application site rash , asthenia , chest discomfort , fatigue , feeling abnormal , heart rate increased , insomnia , malaise , muscle spasms , pain in extremity , weight increased 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) .
Therefore , inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism .
Inducers of CYP3A4 , such as St . John ' s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) preparations , phenobarbital , carbamazepine , and rifampin , may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens , possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and / or changes in the uterine bleeding profile .
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 , such as erythromycin , clarithromycin , ketoconazole , itraconazole , ritonavir , and grapefruit juice , may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and result in adverse reactions .
Inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism and decrease or increase the estrogen plasma concentration ( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Estradiol gel 0 . 1 % is not indicated for use in pregnant women .
There are no data with the use of estradiol gel 0 . 1 % in pregnant women ; however , epidemiologic studies and meta - analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or nongenital birth defects ( including cardiac anomalies and limb - reduction defects ) following exposure to combined hormonal contraceptives ( estrogen and progestins ) before conception or during early pregnancy .
Animal studies to evaluate embryo / fetal toxicity were not conducted with estradiol gel , 0 . 1 % .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Estrogens are present in human milk and can reduce milk production in breast - feeding women .
This reduction can occur at any time but is less likely to occur once breast - feeding is well established .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Estradiol gel 0 . 1 % is not indicated for use in pediatric patients .
Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in studies utilizing estradiol gel 0 . 1 % to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to estradiol gel 0 . 1 % .
The Women ' s Health Initiative Studies In the WHI estrogen - alone substudy ( daily CE [ 0 . 625 mg ] - alone versus placebo ) , there was a higher relative risk of stroke in women greater than 65 years of age [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy ( daily CE [ 0 . 625 mg ] plus MPA [ 2 . 5 mg ] versus placebo ) , there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The Women ' s Health Initiative Memory Study In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age , there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen - alone or estrogen plus progestin when compared to placebo [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age , it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women 8 [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage of estrogen may cause nausea and vomiting , breast tenderness , abdominal pain , drowsiness and fatigue , and withdrawal bleeding in women .
Treatment of overdose consists of discontinuation of estradiol gel 0 . 1 % therapy with institution of appropriate symptomatic care .
11 DESCRIPTION Estradiol gel 0 . 1 % , is a clear , colorless gel , which is odorless when dry .
It is designed to deliver sustained circulating concentrations of estradiol when applied once daily to the skin .
The gel is applied to a small area ( 200 cm2 ) of the thigh in a thin layer .
Estradiol gel 0 . 1 % is available in five doses of 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 75 , 1 . 0 and 1 . 25 g for topical application ( corresponding to 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 75 , 1 . 0 and 1 . 25 mg estradiol , respectively ) .
The active component of the topical gel is estradiol .
Estradiol is a white crystalline powder , chemically described as estra - 1 , 3 , 5 ( 10 ) - triene - 3 , 17ß - diol .
It has an empirical formula of C 18 H 24 O 2 and molecular weight of 272 . 39 .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The remaining components of the gel ( carbomer , ethanol , propylene glycol , purified water , and triethanolamine ) are pharmacologically inactive .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics .
Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions , estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites , estrone and estriol , at the receptor level .
The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle , which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily , depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle .
After menopause , most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione , which is secreted by the adrenal cortex , to estrone in the peripheral tissues .
Thus , estrone and the sulfate conjugated form , estrone sulfate , are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women .
Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen - responsive tissues .
To date , two estrogen receptors have been identified .
These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue .
Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) and FSH , through a negative feedback mechanism .
Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Generally , a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman ’ s therapeutic response to estradiol gel 0 . 1 % nor her risk for adverse outcomes .
Likewise , exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Estradiol diffuses across intact skin and into the systemic circulation by a passive absorption process , with diffusion across the stratum corneum being the rate - limiting factor .
In a 14 - day , Phase 1 , multiple - dose study , estradiol gel 0 . 1 % demonstrated linear and approximately dose - proportional estradiol pharmacokinetics at steady state for both AUC0 - 24 and Cmax following once daily dosing to the skin of either the right or left upper thigh ( Table 2 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Steady - state serum concentration of estradiol are achieved by day 12 following daily application of estradiol gel 0 . 1 % to the skin of the upper thigh .
The mean ( SD ) serum estradiol levels following once daily dosing at day 14 are shown in Figure 1 .
Figure 1 : Mean ( SD ) Serum Estradiol Concentrations ( Values Uncorrected for Baseline ) on Day 14 Following Multiple Daily Doses of Estradiol Gel 0 . 1 % [ MULTIMEDIA ] The effect of sunscreens and other topical lotions on the systemic exposure of estradiol gel 0 . 1 % has not been evaluated .
Studies conducted using topical estrogen gel approved products have shown that sunscreens have the potential for changing the systemic exposure of topically applied estrogen gels .
Distribution The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens .
Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs .
Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to SHBG and albumin .
Metabolism Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens .
Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions .
These transformations take place mainly in the liver .
Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone , and both can be converted to estriol , which is a major urinary metabolite .
Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver , biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine , and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption .
In postmenopausal women , a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates , especially estrone sulfate , which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens .
Although the clinical significance has not been determined , estradiol from estradiol gel 0 . 1 % does not undergo first pass metabolism and provides estradiol to estrone ratios at steady state in the range of 0 . 42 to 0 . 65 .
Excretion Estradiol , estrone , and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates .
The apparent terminal half - life for estradiol was about 10 hours following administration of estradiol gel 0 . 1 % .
Potential for Estradiol Transfer The effect of estradiol transfer was evaluated in healthy postmenopausal women who topically applied 1 . 0 gram of estradiol gel 0 . 1 % ( single dose ) on one thigh .
One and 8 hours after gel application , they engaged in direct thigh - to - arm contact with a partner for 15 minutes .
While some elevation of estradiol levels over baseline was seen in the male subjects , the degree of transferability in this study was inconclusive .
Effects of Washing The effect of application site washing on skin surface levels and serum concentrations of estradiol was determined in 16 healthy postmenopausal women after application of 1 . 0 gram of estradiol gel 0 . 1 % to a 200 cm2 area on the thigh .
Washing the application site with soap and water 1 hour after application removed all detectable amounts of estradiol from the surface of the skin , and resulted in a 30 to 38 percent decrease in the mean total 24 - hour exposure to estradiol .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , and Impairment of Fertility Long - term continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast , uterus , cervix , vagina , testis and liver .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Effects on Vasomotor Symptoms in Postmenopausal Women A randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of 12 - week treatment with three different daily doses of estradiol gel 0 . 1 % for vasomotor symptoms in 495 postmenopausal women ( 86 . 5 percent White ; 10 . 1 percent Black ) between 34 and 89 years of age ( mean age 54 . 6 ) who had at least 50 moderate to severe hot flushes per week at baseline ( 2 week period prior to treatment ) .
Women applied placebo , estradiol gel 0 . 1 % 0 . 25 grams ( 0 . 25 mg estradiol ) , estradiol gel 0 . 1 % 0 . 5 grams ( 0 . 5 mg estradiol ) or estradiol gel 0 . 1 % 1 . 0 grams ( 1 . 0 mg estradiol ) once daily to the thigh .
Reductions in both the median daily frequency and the median daily severity of moderate to severe hot flushes were statistically significant for the 0 . 5 grams per day and the 1 . 0 grams per day estradiol gel 0 . 1 % doses when compared to placebo at week 4 .
Statistically significant reductions in both the median daily frequency and the median daily severity of moderate to severe hot flushes for the estradiol gel 0 . 1 % 0 . 25 grams per day dose when compared to placebo were delayed to week 7 .
There were statistically significant reductions in median daily frequency and severity of hot flushes for all three estradiol gel 0 . 1 % doses ( 0 . 25 grams per day , 0 . 5 grams per day and 1 . 0 grams per day ) compared to placebo at week 12 .
See Table 3 for results .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Women ' s Health Initiative Studies The WHI enrolled approximately 27 , 000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two substudies to assess the risks and benefits of daily oral CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone or in combination with MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) compared to placebo in the prevention of certain chronic diseases .
The primary endpoint was the incidence of CHD ( defined as nonfatal MI , silent MI and CHD death ) , with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome .
A " global index " included the earliest occurrence of CHD , invasive breast cancer , stroke , PE , endometrial cancer ( only in the CE plus MPA substudy ) , colorectal cancer , hip fracture , or death due to other cause .
These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE - alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms .
WHI Estrogen - Alone Substudy The WHI estrogen - alone substudy was stopped early because an increased risk of stroke was observed and it was deemed that no further information would be obtained regarding the risks and benefits of estrogen - alone in predetermined primary endpoints .
Results of the estrogen - alone substudy , which included 10 , 739 women ( average 63 years of age , range 50 to 79 ; 75 . 3 percent White , 15 . 1 percent Black , 6 . 1 percent Hispanic , 3 . 6 percent Other ) , after an average follow - up of 7 . 1 years are presented in Table 4 .

9 The absolute excess risk of events included in the " global index " was a nonsignificant 5 events per 10 , 000 women - years .
There was no difference between the groups in terms of all - cause mortality .
No overall difference for primary CHD events ( nonfatal MI , silent MI and CHD death ) and invasive breast cancer incidence in women receiving CE - alone compared with placebo was reported in final centrally adjudicated results from the estrogen - alone substudy , after an average follow - up of 7 . 1 years .
Centrally adjudicated results for stroke events from the estrogen - alone substudy , after an average follow - up of 7 . 1 years , reported no significant difference in distribution of stroke subtype or severity , including fatal strokes , in women receiving CE - alone compared to placebo .
Estrogen - alone increased the risk for ischemic stroke , and this excess risk was present in all subgroups of women examined .
10 Timing of the initiation of estrogen - alone therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk benefit profile .
The WHI estrogen - alone substudy stratified by age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a non - significant trend toward reduced risk for CHD [ hazard ratio ( HR ) 0 . 63 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 36 – 1 . 09 ) ] and overall mortality [ HR 0 . 71 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 46 – 1 . 11 ) ] .
WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early .
According to the predefined stopping rule , after an average follow - up of 5 . 6 years of treatment , the increased risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the " global index . "
The absolute excess risk of events included in the " global index " was 19 per 10 , 000 women - years .
For those outcomes included in the WHI " global index " that reached statistical significance after 5 . 6 years of follow - up , the absolute excess risks per 10 , 000 women - years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events , 8 more strokes , 10 more PEs , and 8 more invasive breast cancers , while the absolute risk reductions per 10 , 000 women - years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures .
Results of the CE plus MPA substudy , which included 16 , 608 women ( average 63 years of age , range 50 to 79 ; 83 . 9 percent White , 6 . 8 percent Black , 5 . 4 percent Hispanic , 3 . 9 percent Other ) , are presented in Table 5 .

14 . 3 Women ' s Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen - alone ancillary study of WHI enrolled 2 , 947 predominantly healthy hysterectomized postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age ( 45 percent were 65 to 69 year of age , 36 percent were 70 to 74 years of age , and 19 percent were 75 years of age and older ) to evaluate the effects of daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone on the incidence of probable dementia ( primary outcome ) compared to placebo .
After an average follow - up of 5 . 2 years , the relative risk of probable dementia for CE - alone versus placebo was 1 . 49 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 83 – 2 . 66 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE - alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10 , 000 women - years .
Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer disease ( AD ) , vascular dementia ( VaD ) and mixed type ( having features of both AD and VaD ) .
The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD .
Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age , it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study enrolled 4 , 532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older ( 47 percent were 65 to 69 years of age , 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age , and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older ) to evaluate the effects of daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) on the incidence of probable dementia ( primary outcome ) compared to placebo .
After an average follow - up of 4 years , the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2 . 05 ( 95 percent CI , 1 . 21 – 3 . 48 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 per 10 , 000 women - years .
