SPL listing data elements section [ MULTIMEDIA ] 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE • ORACEA is a tetracycline - class drug indicated for the treatment of only inflammatory lesions ( papules and pustules ) of rosacea in adult patients .
( 1 . 1 ) Limitations of Use This formulation of doxycycline has not been evaluated in the treatment or prevention of infections .
Do not use ORACEA for treating bacterial infections , providing antibacterial prophylaxis , or reducing the numbers or eliminating microorganisms associated with any bacterial disease .
( 1 . 2 ) ORACEA has not been evaluated for the treatment of the erythematous , telangiectatic , or ocular components of rosacea .
( 1 . 2 ) 1 . 1 Indication ORACEA is indicated for the treatment of only inflammatory lesions ( papules and pustules ) of rosacea in adult patients .
No meaningful effect was demonstrated for generalized erythema ( redness ) of rosacea .
1 . 2 Limitations of Use This formulation of doxycycline has not been evaluated in the treatment or prevention of infections .
Do not use ORACEA for treating bacterial infections , providing antibacterial prophylaxis , or reducing the numbers or eliminating microorganisms associated with any bacterial disease .
To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria as well as to maintain the effectiveness of other antibacterial drugs , ORACEA should be used only as indicated .
ORACEA has not been evaluated for the treatment of the erythematous , telangiectatic , or ocular components of rosacea .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Take one ORACEA capsule ( 40 mg ) once daily in the morning on an empty stomach , preferably at least one hour prior to or two hours after meals .
( 2 . 1 ) Exceeding the recommended dosage may result in an increased incidence of side effects including the development of resistant microorganisms .
( 2 . 2 , 5 . 9 ) 2 . 1 General Dosing Information Take one ORACEA capsule ( 40 mg ) once daily in the morning on an empty stomach , preferably at least one hour prior to or two hours after meals .
Administration of adequate amounts of fluid along with the capsules is recommended to wash down the capsule to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
2 . 2 Important Considerations for Dosing Regimen The dosage of ORACEA differs from that of doxycycline used to treat infections .
Exceeding the recommended dosage may result in an increased incidence of side effects including the development of resistant organisms .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS 40 mg beige opaque capsule imprinted with “ GLD 40 ” 40 mg capsule .
( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to doxycycline or any of the other tetracyclines .
ORACEA is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to doxycycline or other tetracyclines .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • The use of ORACEA during tooth development ( the second and third trimesters of pregnancy , infancy and childhood up to the age of 8 years ) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth ( yellow - gray - brown ) and reversible inhibition of bone growth .
( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 4 ) • Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of Clostridium difficile .
If C . difficile associated diarrhea occurs , discontinue ORACEA .
( 5 . 3 ) • If renal impairment exists , ORACEA doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver injury .
( 5 . 4 ) • Photosensitivity can occur with ORACEA ; Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight .
( 5 . 5 ) • Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes ; if symptoms develop , discontinue ORACEA immediately .
( 5 . 6 ) • ORACEA may cause pseudotumor cerebri ( benign intracranial hypertension ) .
Discontinue ORACEA if symptoms occur .
( 5 . 8 ) • Bacterial resistance to tetracyclines may develop in patients using ORACEA .
It should only be used as indicated .
( 5 . 9 ) 5 . 1 Inhibition of Bone Growth During Fetal and Pediatric Development Doxycycline , like other tetracycline - class drugs , may cause inhibition of bone growth when administered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy , infancy , and childhood .
All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone - forming tissue .
A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg / kg every 6 hours .
This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued .
If doxycycline is used during the second or third trimester of pregnancy , advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 2 Tooth Discoloration During Fetal and Pediatric Development The use of tetracycline class drugs orally during tooth development ( last half of pregnancy , infancy , and childhood up to the age of 8 years ) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth ( yellow - gray - brown ) .
This adverse reaction is more common during long - term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short - term courses .
Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported .
Use of tetracycline drugs is not recommended during tooth development [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 3 Clostridium difficile Associated Diarrhea ( CDAD ) Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents , including doxycycline , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate management should be instituted as clinically indicated .
5 . 4 Metabolic Effects The anti - anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN .
While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function , in patients with significantly impaired function , higher serum levels of tetracycline - class antibiotics may lead to azotemia , hyperphosphatemia , and acidosis .
If renal impairment exists , even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity .
Under such conditions , lower than usual total doses are indicated , and if therapy is prolonged , serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable .
5 . 5 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines .
Although this was not observed during the duration of the clinical studies with ORACEA , patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight ( tanning beds or UVA / B treatment ) while using ORACEA .
If patients need to be outdoors while using ORACEA , they should wear loose - fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician .
5 . 6 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes .
Symptoms may be manifested by fever , rash , arthralgia , and malaise .
In symptomatic patients , liver function tests , ANA , CBC , and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients .
Use of all tetracycline - class drugs should be discontinued immediately .
5 . 7 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline - class drugs are known to cause hyperpigmentation .
Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs , including nails , bone , skin , eyes , thyroid , visceral tissue , oral cavity ( teeth , mucosa , alveolar bone ) , sclerae and heart valves .
Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration , whereas other pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration .
Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury .
5 . 8 Pseudotumor Cerebri Pseudotumor cerebri ( benign intracranial hypertension ) in adults has been associated with the use of tetracyclines .
The usual clinical manifestations are headache and blurred vision .
Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants .
While both of these conditions and related symptoms usually resolve after discontinuation of the tetracycline , the possibility for permanent sequelae exists .
Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines and should be routinely checked for papiledema while on treatment .
5 . 9 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to tetracyclines may develop in patients using ORACEA .
Because of the potential for drug - resistant bacteria to develop during the use of ORACEA , it should only be used as indicated .
5 . 10 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations , use of ORACEA may result in overgrowth of non - susceptible microorganisms , including fungi .
If superinfection occurs , ORACEA should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted .
Although not observed in clinical trials with ORACEA , the use of tetracyclines may increase the incidence of vaginal candidiasis .
ORACEA should be used with caution in patients with a history of or predisposition to Candida overgrowth .
5 . 11 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems , including hematopoietic , renal and hepatic studies should be performed .
Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Some of the most common adverse reactions ( incidence > 2 % and more common than with placebo ) are nasopharyngitis , sinusitis , diarrhea , hypertension and aspartate aminotransferase increase .

Adverse Reactions for Tetracyclines : The following adverse reactions have been observed in patients receiving tetracyclines at higher , antimicrobial doses : Gastrointestinal : anorexia , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , glossitis , dysphagia , enterocolitis , and inflammatory lesions ( with vaginal candidiasis ) in the anogenital region .
Hepatotoxicity , Esophagitis and esophageal ulcerations have been reported in patients receiving the capsule forms of the drugs in the tetracycline - class .
Most of the patients experiencing esophagitis and / or esophageal ulceration took their medication immediately before lying down [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Renal toxicity : Rise in BUN has been reported and is apparently dose - related [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Skin : maculopapular and erythematous rashes .
Exfoliative dermatitis .
Photosensitivity is discussed above [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Hypersensitivity reactions : urticaria , angioneurotic edema , anaphylaxis , anaphylactoid purpura , serum sickness , pericarditis , and exacerbation of systemic lupus erythematosus .
Blood : Hemolytic anemia , thrombocytopenia , neutropenia , and eosinophilia .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of ORACEA : Nervous system : Pseudotumor cerebri ( benign intracranial hypertension ) , headache .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Patients on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage .
( 7 . 1 ) • Some bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin , it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline - class drugs in conjunction with penicillin .
( 7 . 2 ) • The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity .
( 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Anticoagulants Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity , patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage .
7 . 2 Penicillin Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin , it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline - class drugs in conjunction with penicillin .
7 . 3 Methoxyflurane The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity .
7 . 4 Antacids and Iron Preparations Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by bismuth subsalicylate , proton pump inhibitors , antacids containing aluminum , calcium or magnesium and iron - containing preparations .
7 . 5 Oral Retinoids There have been reports of pseudotumor cerebri ( benign intracranial hypertension ) associated with the concomitant use of isotretinoin and tetracyclines .
Since both oral retinoids , including isotretinoin and acitretin , and the tetracyclines , primarily minocycline , can cause increased intracranial pressure , the concurrent use of an oral retinoid and a tetracycline should be avoided .
7 . 6 Barbiturates and Anti - epileptics Barbiturates , carbamazepine , and phenytoin decrease the half - life of doxycycline .
7 . 7 Drug / Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Breastfeeding is not recommended ( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Doxycycline may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth and permanent discoloration of deciduous teeth when administered during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 and 5 . 2 ) ] .
Available data from published studies have not shown a difference in major birth defect risk with doxycycline exposure in the first trimester of pregnancy compared to unexposed pregnancies .
Avoid use of ORECEA during the second and third trimester of pregnancy .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 – 4 % and 15 – 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data Published studies , including epidemiological and observational studies , with use of doxycycline during the first trimester of pregnancy have not identified drug - related increases in major birth defects .
The use of tetracycline during tooth development ( second and third trimester of pregnancy ) may cause permanent discoloration of deciduous teeth ( yellow - gray - brown ) .
This adverse reaction is more common during long - term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short - term courses .
Animal Data Results from animal studies indicate that doxycycline crosses the placenta and is found in fetal tissues .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Based on available published data , doxycycline is likely to be present in human breast milk but the specific concentration in breastmilk is not clear .
There is no information on the effects of doxycycline on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production .
Because there are other antibacterial drug options available to treat rosacea in lactating women and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions , including tooth discoloration and inhibition of bone growth , advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with ORACEA and for 5 days after the last dose .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use ORACEA should not be used in infants and children less than 8 years of age [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
ORACEA has not been studied in children of any age with regard to safety or efficacy , therefore use in children is not recommended .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ORACEA did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and concomitant disease or other drug therapy .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ORACEA in the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea is unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics ORACEA capsules are not bioequivalent to other doxycycline products .
The pharmacokinetics of doxycycline following oral administration of ORACEA was investigated in 2 volunteer studies involving 61 adults .
Pharmacokinetic parameters for ORACEA following single oral doses and at steady - state in healthy subjects are presented in Table 2 .
Table 2 .
Pharmcokinetic Parameters [ Mean ( ± SD ) ] for ORACEA N Cmax [ 1 ] ( ng / mL ) Tmax [ 2 ] ( hr ) AU0 - ∞ null ( ng ● hr / mL ) t ½ null ( hr ) Single Dose 40 mg capsules 30 510 ± 220 . 7 3 . 00 ( 1 . 0 - 4 . 1 ) 9227 ± 3212 . 8 21 . 2 ± 7 . 6 Steady - State [ 3 ] 40 mg capsules 31 600 ± 194 . 2 2 . 00 ( 1 . 0 - 4 . 0 ) 7543 ± 2443 . 9 23 . 2 ± 6 . 2 [ 1 ] Mean [ 2 ] Median [ 3 ] Day 7 Absorption : In a single - dose food - effect study involving administration of ORACEA to healthy volunteers , concomitant administration with a 1000 calorie , high - fat , high - protein meal that included dairy products , resulted in a decrease in the rate and extent of absorption ( Cmax and AUC ) by about 45 % and 22 % , respectively , compared to dosing under fasted conditions .
This decrease in systemic exposure can be clinically significant , and therefore if ORACEA is taken close to meal times , it is recommended that it be taken at least one hour prior to or two hours after meals .
Distribution : Doxycycline is greater than 90 % bound to plasma proteins .
Metabolism : Major metabolites of doxycycline have not been identified .
However , enzyme inducers such as barbiturates , carbamazepine , and phenytoin decrease the half - life of doxycycline .
Excretion : Doxycycline is excreted in the urine and feces as unchanged drug .
It is reported that between 29 % and 55 . 4 % of an administered dose can be accounted for in the urine by 72 hours .
Terminal half - life averaged 21 . 2 hours in subjects receiving a single dose of ORACEA .
Special Populations Geriatric : Doxycycline pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated in geriatric patients .
Pediatric : Doxycycline pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated in pediatric patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] Gender : The pharmacokinetics of ORACEA were compared in 16 male and 14 female subjects under fed and fasted conditions .
While female subjects had a higher Cmax and AUC than male subjects , these differences were thought to be due to differences in body weight / lean body mass .
Race : Differences in doxycycline pharmacokinetics among racial groups have not been evaluated .
Renal Insufficiency : Studies have shown no significant difference in serum half - life of doxycycline in patients with normal and severely impaired renal function .
Hemodialysis does not alter the serum half - life of doxycycline .
Hepatic Insufficiency : Doxycycline pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated in patients with hepatic insufficiency .
Gastric Insufficiency : In a study in healthy volunteers ( N = 24 ) the bioavailability of doxycycline is reported to be reduced at high pH . This reduced bioavailability may be clinically significant in patients with gastrectomy , gastric bypass surgery or who are otherwise deemed achlorhydric .
Drug Interactions : [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
12 . 4 Microbiology Doxycycline is a member of the tetracycline - class of drugs .
The plasma concentrations of doxycycline achieved with ORACEA during administration [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] are less than the concentration required to treat bacterial diseases .
ORACEA should not be used for treating bacterial infections , providing antibacterial prophylaxis , or reducing the numbers or eliminating microorganisms associated with any bacterial disease [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 . 2 ) ] .
In vivo microbiological studies utilizing a similar drug exposure for up to 18 months demonstrated no detectable long term effects on bacterial flora of the oral cavity , skin , intestinal tract and vagina .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Doxycycline was assessed for potential to induce carcinogenesis in a study in which the compound was administered to Sprague - Dawley rats by gavage at dosages of 20 , 75 , and 200 mg / kg / day for two years .
An increased incidence of uterine polyps was observed in female rats that received 200 mg / kg / day , a dosage that resulted in a systemic exposure to doxycycline approximately 12 . 2 times that observed in female humans who use ORACEA [ exposure comparison based upon area under the curve ( AUC ) values ] .
No impact upon tumor incidence was observed in male rats up to at 200 mg / kg / day , or in females at the lower dosages studied .
Doxycyline was assessed for potential to induce carcinogenesis in CD - 1 mice by gavage at dosages 20 , 75 , and 150 mg / kg / day in males and at dosages of 20 , 100 , and 300 mg / kg / day in females .
No impact upon tumor incidence was observed in male and female mice at systemic exposures approximately 4 . 2 and 8 . 3 times that observed in humans , respectively .
Doxycycline demonstrated no potential to cause genetic toxicity in an in vitro point mutation study with mammalian cells ( CHO / HGPRT forward mutation assay ) or in an in vivo micronucleus assay conducted in CD - 1 mice .
However , data from an in vitro mammalian chromosomal aberration assay conducted with CHO cells suggest that doxycycline is a weak clastogen .
Oral administration of doxycycline to male and female Sprague - Dawley rats adversely affected fertility and reproductive performance , as evidenced by increased time for mating to occur , reduced sperm motility , velocity , and concentration , abnormal sperm morphology , and increased pre - and post - implantation losses .
Doxycycline induced reproductive toxicity at all dosages that were examined in this study , as even the lowest dosage tested ( 50 mg / kg / day ) induced a statistically significant reduction in sperm velocity .
Note that 50 mg / kg / day is approximately 3 . 6 times the amount of doxycycline contained in the recommended daily dose of ORACEA when compared on the basis of AUC estimates .
Although doxycycline impairs the fertility of rats when administered at sufficient dosage , the effect of ORACEA on human fertility is unknown .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of ORACEA in the treatment of only inflammatory lesions ( papules and pustules ) of rosacea was evaluated in two randomized , placebo - controlled , multi - centered , double - blind , 16 - week Phase 3 trials involving 537 subjects ( total of 269 subjects on ORACEA from the two trials ) with rosacea ( 10 to 40 papules and pustules and two or fewer nodules ) .
Mean baseline lesion counts were 20 and 21 for ORACEA and placebo subject groups respectively .
Pregnant and nursing women , subjects < 18 years of age , and subjects with ocular rosacea and / or blepharitis / meibomianitis who require ophthalmologic treatment were excluded from trials .
At Week 16 , subjects in the ORACEA group were evaluated using co - primary endpoints of mean reduction in lesion counts and a dichotomized static Investigator ’ s Global Assessment of Clear or Almost Clear ( defined as 1 to 2 small papules or pustules ) when compared to the placebo group in both Phase 3 trials .
Table 3 : Clinical Results of ORACEA versus Placebo Study 1 Study 2 ORACEA Placebo ORACEA Placebo 40 mg N = 127 N = 124 40 mg N = 142 N = 144 Mean Change in Lesion Count from Baseline - 11 . 8 - 5 . 9 - 9 . 5 - 4 . 3 No .
