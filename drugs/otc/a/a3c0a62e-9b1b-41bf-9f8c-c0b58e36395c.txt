STANDARDIZED GRASS POLLEN EXTRACTS LABELED IN BAU / ml ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE WITH GRASS POLLEN EXTRACTS LABELED IN AU / ml OR WITH NON - STANDARDIZED ( WEIGHT / VOLUME ) GRASS POLLEN EXTRACTS . For guidance in selecting dose , refer to Table A in the Clinical Pharmacology section that describes the potency of non - standardized grass pollen extracts .
Comparative skin tests can be performed to determine the relative potency before initial use of new extracts .
For previously untreated patents , initial dose must be based on skin testing as described in the Dosage and Administration section of this insert .
Patients being switched from other types of extracts to Allergy Laboratories should have their dose adjusted .
Extracts standardized in BAU ( Bioequivalent Allergy Unit ) may differ in potency from non - standardized extracts .
Comparative skin tests can be performed to determine relative potency of standardized versus non - standardized extracts .
The dosage should be reduced 75 % when switching from one lot of standardized grass pollen extract to another Iot .
Patients with unstable or severe asthma , including steroid - dependent asthma , are at increased risk for more frequent and more severe reactions from allergy extract injections .
Greater caution must be exerted with such patients at all phases of extract administration , but particularly during build up .
For example , extract therapy might be initiated at weaker concentrations and built by smaller dosage increments than in comparably allergic rhinitis patients without asthma .
Also when asthma is poorly controlled , the injection regimen might be temporarily interrupted ( at the discretion of the physician ) until control of asthma is re - established .
Whenever a reaction occurs in such patients their asthma should be medically stabilized before injections are resumed with an appropriate dosage reduction .
Patients should be instructed to recognize adverse reaction symptoms and cautioned to contact physician ' s office if reaction symptoms occur .
As with all allergenic extracts , severe systemic reactions may occur .
In certain individuals these life threatening reactions may be fatal .
Patients should be observed for at least 30 minutes following treatment and emergency measures as well as personnel trained in their use should be immediately available in the event of a life threatening reaction .
Serious adverse reactions can be reported to the U S Food and Drug Administration MedWatch Program .
The MedWatch forms can be obtained by calling 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 .
The address is MedWatch , 5600 Fishers Lane , Rockville , MD 20852 - 9787 .
This product should not be injected intravenously .
Subcutaneous injections are recommended .
Patients who are taking non - selective beta blockers may be more reactive to allergens given for testing or treatment and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions .
Refer also to the warnings , precautions , adverse reactions and dosage sections below .
DESCRIPTION : Standardized grass pollen extracts labeled in BAU / ml are not interchangeable with grass pollen extracts labeled in AU / ml or with non - standardized grass pollen extracts .
The recommended route of administration for immunotherapy is subcutaneous .
The routes of administration for diagnostic purposes are intradermal or prick - puncture of the skin .
Do not inject intravenously .
The extract is sterile and contains 50 % ( v / v ) glycerin as a preservative .
Standardized grass pollen extracts are available in both 10 , 000 BAU / ml and 100 , 000 BAU / ml potencies , except for Bermuda which is only available in 10 , 000 BAU / ml .
The source material of the standardized grass extracts are the grass pollens .
The 100 , 000 BAU / ml grass pollen extracts are prepared by extracting pollen at a 1 : 10 w / v ratio then diluting if necessary to the appropriate range for 100 , 000 BAU / ml .
The 10 , 000 BAU / ml grass pollen extracts are prepared by dilution of the 100 , 000 BAU / ml grass pollen extracts .
The 10 , 000 BAU / ml Bermuda grass pollen extract is prepared by extracting Bermuda grass pollen at a 1 : 10 w / v ratio then diluting if necessary to the appropriate range for 10 , 000 BAU / ml .
The potency ( in Bioequivalent Allergy Units per ml or BAU / ml ) of standardized grass pollen extracts is determined by an in - vitro ELISA Competition assay ( 1 ) against CBER reference extracts and CBER reference serum pools distributed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research , U S Food and Drug Administration .
Potency based on Bioequivalent Allergy Units ( BAU / ml ) is printed on the label .
FDA reference grass pollen extracts were assigned potency designations based on quantitative skin testing ( 2 ) .
The FDA reference extracts which can be diluted 1 : 500 , 000 fold intradermally to produce a sum of erythema diameter response of 50 mm in highly puncture reactive subjects have been assigned 10 , 000 BAU / ml .
References which can be diluted 1 : 5 , 000 , 000 fold intraderrnally to produce a sum of erythema diameter response of 50 mm have been assigned 100 , 000 BAU / ml .
INACTIVE INGREDIENTS : Glycerinated extracts contain : glycerin 50 . 0 % v / v sodium chloride 0 . 166 % w / v sodium bicarbonate 0 . 091 % w / v CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : The allergic state is initiated by an immune response inducing B cells to produce IgE antibodies to specific allergens .
IgE antibodies bind to surface receptors on mast cells and basophils .
When antigens gain access to the immune system they react with the bound IgE .
The reacting antigen to the surface bound IgE stimulates a number of chemical mediators to be released from the mast cells and basophils .
These include histamine , Eosinophil Chemotactic Factor ( ECF - A ) and leukotrienes .
These chemical mediators are pharmacologically active at low concentrations and are partially responsible for the biological manifestations of the allergic response .
( 3 ) The mechanism by which immunotherapy achieves hyposensitization is not completely understood .
There is an increase in " blocking antibody " ( lgG ) titer and in some patients a decrease in specific IgE , a decrease in histamine release to specific allergen and an increase in suppressor celI population to specific allergen .
These changes may occur only after prolonged therapy .

The standardized ( Bioequivalent Allergy Unit ) extract in these vials is designed primarily for the physician equipped to prepare dilutions and mixtures as required .
STANDARDIZED GRASS POLLEN EXTRACTS LABELED IN BAU / ml ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE WITH GRASS POLLEN EXTRACTS LABELED IN AU / ml OR WITH NON - STANDARDIZED ( WEIGHT / VOLUME ) GRASS POLLEN EXTRACTS .
Patients being switched from other types of extracts to Allergy Laboratories should have their dose adjusted .
Diagnosis of allergic disease to these grasses is made through a combined medical history sufficiently complete to identify allergic symptoms to grass pollen and identification of grass allergy by diagnostic skin testing .
It is recommended that diagnostic skin testing ( scratch or puncture ) be performed with 10 , 000 BAU / ml grass pollen extracts before testing with 100 , 000 BAU / ml grass pollen extracts .
10 , 000 BAU / mL and 100 , 000 BAU / ml grass pollen extracts for immunotherapy are available for previously treated patients to facilitate dose selection for safe switching from non - standardized to standardized extracts .
Patients being treated with grass pollen extracts for the first time can be initially immunized with dilutions prepared from the 10 , 000 BAU / ml extract ( see Dosage and Administration ) .
100 , 000 BAU / ml grass pollen extract can be administered if the patient tolerates the 10 , 000 BAU / ml extract .
Grass pollen immunotherapy is intended for patients whose grass allergic symptoms cannot be satisfactorily controlled by avoidance of the offending allergen or by the use of symptomatic medications .
( 5 ) CONTRAINDICATIONS : There are no known absolute contraindications to hyposensitization therapy .
See precautions section for pregnancy risks .
A patient without a history of grass pollen allergy symptoms and a positive skin test reaction to grass pollen should not be treated .
The physician must determine if the benefits outweigh the risks in using these products for treating patients .
The benefit to risk ratio should be carefully weighed especially where risks of immunotherapy are higher than usual .
This includes severe unstable asthma , highly allergic patients who have had previous severe or unusual problems with injections , pregnancy , or any fragile general medical condition .
This also includes patients where potential benefits are limited due to coexisting non - allergic disease such as : non - specific vasomotor rhinitis , nasal septal deviation , nasal polyps , COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) , cardiovascular or other non - allergic respiratory disease .
WARNINGS See WARNINGS box at the beginning of the instruction sheet .
Extracts standardized using the Bioequivalent Allergy Unit may be more or less potent than extracts based on AU / ml , weight to volume , or PNU methods of expressing potency .
See Adverse Reactions section in this insert for a description of the possible local reactions and systemic reactions .
Comparative skin tests can be performed to determine the relative potency before initial use of new extracts .
DO NOT GIVE ALLERGY INJECTIONS INTRAVENOUSLY .
Subcutaneous injections are recommended .
Injections may produce large local reactions that may be painful to the patient .
DO NOT GIVE FULL - STRENGTH INJECTIONS UNTIL COMPARATIVE SKIN TESTING IS PERFORMED .
After inserting the needle , but before injecting extract , withdraw the plunger slightly .
If blood appears in the syringe re - insert the needle at another site .
Careful selection of dose and injection should prevent most systemic reactions .
PRECAUTIONS : GENERAL : The dosage should be reduced 50 - 75 % from the previous dose when starting a patient on a new lot of standardized grass extract from the same manufacturer or from a different manufacturer .
Table A in the Clinical Pharmacology section of this insert can be used for guidance when changing from a non - standardized grass extract to a standardized grass extract .
The table shows the similarity in potency of two Iots of the non - standardized grass extracts with respect to the 10 , 000 BAU / ml standardized extracts .
Comparative skin testing can be used to determine the dose .
A separate sterile tuberculin type syringe should be used with each patient to prevent cross contamination of extracts .
This will also prevent transmission of disease such as hepatitis , AIDS and other infectious diseases .
Aseptic technique should always be used when injections of allergenic extracts are administered .
INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS : Because most serious reactions following the administration of allergenic extracts occur within 30 minutes of the injection , the patient should remain under observation for this period of time .
The size of the local reaction should be recorded , because increasingly large local reaction may precede a subsequent systemic reaction with increasing dosage .
The patient should be instructed to report any unusual reactions to the attention of the physician .
In particular , this includes swelling and / or tenderness at the injection site or reactions such as rhinorrhea , sneezing , coughing , wheezing , shortness of breath , nausea , dizziness or faintness .
DRUG INTERACTIONS : Patients who are taking non - selective beta blockers may be more reactive to skin tests and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reactions .
Antihistamines can significantly inhibit the immediate skin test reactions .
If long acting antihistamines have been taken recently , it is recommended that they should be stopped for the following minimum intervals before skin testing is performed : at least 1 month for astemizole ; 1 week for hydroxyzine or cetirizine ; 4 to 7 days for Ioratadine ; 3 to 4 days for terfenadine or fexofenadine ; and 24 to 48 hours for other sustained release antihistamines .
( 6 ) CARCINOGENESIS , MUTAGENESIS , IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY : Long term studies with extracts have not been conducted in animals to determine their potential for carcinogenesis , mutagenesis , or impairment of fertility .
PREGNANCY : Pregnancy Category C . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with allergenic extracts .
It is also not known whether allergenic extracts can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Allergenic extracts should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Controlled studies of hyposensitization with moderate to high doses of allergenic extracts in pregnant women have failed to demonstrate any risk to the mother or fetus .
( 7 ) Initiation of effective immunotherapy may be beneficial if it allows a pregnant patient to forego medications during the first trimester when the fetus is more vulnerable to teratogenic agents , or if it contributes to better control of asthma so the fetus has less likelihood of being damaged by hypoxemia .
However , with histamines known ability to contract uterine muscles any reaction which would release significant amounts of histamine such as hyposensitization overdose should be avoided .
The physician must weigh the benefits of immunotherapy against the risk of anaphylactic reactions that could result in harm to the mother and / or fetus .
Hyposensitization should be used during pregnancy only if clearly necessary and administered cautiously .
If a woman is on maintenance dose the occurrence of pregnancy is not an indication to stop injection therapy .
NURSING MOTHERS : It is not known if allergenic extracts are excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when extracts are administered to nursing women .
PEDIATRIC USE Standardizedgrass pollen extract has not been studied in children , so the safety in children has not been established .
The extracts may cause some pain or discomfort when injected , as well as systemic , adverse reactions ( see Warnings and Adverse Reactions ) .
The maximum tolerated dose may be less than the adult dose due to the smaller size of the child .
Therefore , the volume of the dose may need to be adjusted from the adult schedules provided .
ADVERSE REACTIONS : ( 1 ) Local Reactions : Some swelling and redness at the site of injection is not unusual .
Mild burning that occurs immediately after the injection is normal ; this usually subsides in 10 to 20 seconds .
If the swelling and redness persist for a period of 24 hours or longer this should be a sign to proceed with caution in increasing the dosage .
With the next injection the dosage should remain the same or be decreased .
Large local reactions may indicate that a systemicreaction could occur with the next injection if the dosage was increased .
If a patient continues to have reactions at the maintenance dose , the patient is considered to have exceeded the maximum tolerated dosage .
( 2 ) Systemic Reactions : Systemic reactions occur infrequently but must be looked for in all patients , especially highly sensitive patients .
Anaphylactic shock and death are always possible , therefore , physicians must beprepared for the treatment of these reactions .
Systemic reactions can also be characterized by one or more of the following symptoms : angioedema , tachycardia , conjunctivitis , cough , fainting , hypotension , pallor , rhinitis , urticaria and wheezing .
Systemic reaction can be treated by the immediate application of a tourniquet above the site of injection and the administration of 0 . 3 to 0 . 5 ml of 1 : 1000 Epinephrine - Hydrochloride subcutaneously or intramuscularly in the opposite arm .
The dosage may be repeated two times at 15 minute intervals .
Loosen the tourniquet at least every 10 minutes .
The pediatric dosage for 1 : 1000 Epinephrine - Hydrochloride is 0 . 05 to 0 . 1 ml for infants to 2 years of age ; 0 . 15 ml , for children 2 to 6 years ; and 0 . 2 ml , for children 6 to 12 years .
Patients should always be observed for at least 30 minutes after any injection .
Hypotension can be reversed by using vasopressor agents and volume expanders .
Parenteral aminophylline and inhalation bronchodilators may be required for bronchospasm .
Oxygen may also be needed .
Maintenance of an open airwayis critical if upper airway obstruction is present .
Adrenal corticosteroids and intravenous antihistamine can be given after adequate epinephrine and circulatory support has been administered .
Physicians must be familiar with these systemic reactions and have all the equipment and drugs necessary for proper treatment .
( 8 ) Serious adverse reactions can be reported to the US Food and Drug Administration MedWatch Program .
The MedWatch forms can be obtained by calling 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 .
The address is : MedWatch , 5600 Fishers Lane , Rockville , MD , 20852 - 9787 .
OVERDOSAGE : Refer to Adverse Reactions section above .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : DIAGNOSTIC SKIN TESTING : These products are used to determine a patient ' s sensitivity to specific antigens and aid in the diagnosis and treatment of atopic diseases .
After a thorough history , a decision can be made as to which allergens will be appropriate to use for testing .
The recommended procedure is to initially perform puncture tests , then follow with intradermal tests .
For enhanced safety , scratch or puncture test with 10 , 000 BAU / ml before testing with 100 , 000 BAU / ml .
See recommended dosage below : SCRATCH OR PUNCTURE TEST : Concentration BAU / ml Dosage Bermuda Grass 1 drop 10 , 000 Other Grasses 10 , 000 1 drop 100 , 000 1 drop INTRADERMAL TEST : Concentration BAU / ml Dosage ml When scratch or puncture test is negative : 100 0 . 02 When scratch or puncture test is positive : [ 1 ] 0 . 02 [ 1 ] See Table B for information regarding range of BAU / ml that elicits a 50 mm response for highly reactive patients .
The negative intradermal control used for the 100 BAU / ml concentration should contain 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) glycerin .
FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION : The number of skin tests applied at one time will depend on the particular patient and their allergic history .
These tests should be performed and observed in 15 to 20 minutes .
Additional tests may be applied in sequence .
Perform tests on the anterolateralaspect of the upper arm on an area that permits the effective application of a tourniquet proximal to the site of the test .
The skin at the site of injection should be disinfected with rubbing alcohol before testing .
Puncture testing : Apply one drop of extract to the skin .
Pierce the drop of extract and skin using a sterile hypodermic needle or vaccinating needle .
Maintain the needle perpendicular to the skin surface and rock the needle back and forth to produce a small hole without bleeding .
Do not rotate or gouge the needle .
Remove needle from skin and wipe excess extract from skin surface .
Scratch testing : Using a scarifier or needle , make a scratch 1 / 16 inch long on the epidermis penetrating the outer cornified area but being careful not to draw blood .
Apply one drop of extract to the scratch .
Intradermal testing : Use a separate sterile syringe ( tuberculin type equipped with a 27 gauge by 3 / 8 inch needle with intradermal bevel ) for each antigen .
The tests are made by injecting 0 . 02 ml of allergen into the epidermis .
If the test has been performed properly , the solution should raise a bleb 2 to 3 mm in diameter .
If the bleb does not appear , the injection was made too deeply .
A negative control consisting of the same solution that the extract was prepared in , should be applied to one of the sites in the same manner as the tests being performed .
For example , the negative intradermal control should contain 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) glycerin , if a 100 BAU / ml concentration grass is used for intradermal testing .
Histamine phosphate should be used as a positive control for evaluation of skin testing .
Histamine phosphate is available from other manufacturers .
See their directions for use , for recommended dosage and interpretation of results .
A positive reaction usually develops in 15 to 20 minutes .
The positive response is a wheal and flare reaction that is larger than the negative control and judged on the size of the reaction .
Scratch or puncture tests may not elicit as large and well defined reaction as the intradermal .
( 5 ) The following grading system for intradermal testing is recommended ( 9 ) : Reaction Erythema Wheal 0 < 5 mm < 5 mm + / - 5 - 10 mm 5 - 10 mm 1 + 11 - 20 mm 5 - 10 mm 2 + 21 - 30 mm 5 - 10 mm 3 + 31 - 40 mm 10 - 15 mm or with pseudopods 4 + > 40 mm > 15 mm or with many pseudopods IMMUNOTHERAPY : The following are two methods of injection therapy : 1 .
Pre - seasonal in which treatment is begun three months before seasonal difficulty begins and brought to maintenance dose by injections 4 to 7 days apart and discontinued after that season ends .
2 .
Perennial treatment is the recommended mode of therapy in which the patient is , by injection therapy , brought up to tolerated maintenance dose and remains at that dose until amelioration of allergic symptoms occurs .
Injections may be given at intervals of 4 to 7 days .
Allergenic extracts must be diluted before use .
Normally immunotherapy can be started with a 1 BAU / ml dilution .
If a patient appears to be extremely sensitive , based on skin testing results , dilutions of the extract can further be made before injections are started .
See Table B for additional information .
The following are suggested procedures for making a proper dilution series .
Recommended diluents contain 0 . 9 % sodium chloride and 0 . 4 % phenol as a preservative .
Dlluents with HSA ( Human Serum Albumin ) as a stabilizer can also be used .
Allergenic extracts should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
TEN FOLD DILUTION SERIES : EXTRACT VOLUME EXTRACT CONCENTRATION BAU / ml DILUENT VOLUME DILUTION CONCENTRATION BAU / ml 1 part 100 , 000 + 9 parts = 10 , 000 1 part 10 , 000 + 9 parts = 1 , 000 1 part 1 , 000 + 9 parts = 100 1 part 100 + 9 parts = 10 1 part 10 + 9 parts = 1 Perennial treatment may be started using the following dosage and dilution schedule .
( Modified from Reference 10 ) This schedule is only illustrative and may not be applicable to all patients , since the degree of sensitivity to grass allergens differs among individuals .
The dose administered must be adjusted based on the patient ' s sensitivity and tolerance .
Initial dose can be based on end point titration using a dose that elicits a 1 - 2 + reaction .
Maintenance dose is based on patient tolerance .
Dose # Dose Volume ( ml ) Concentration 1 0 . 05 1 BAU / ml 2 0 . 10 3 0 . 20 4 0 . 30 5 0 . 40 6 0 . 50 7 0 . 05 10 BAU / ml 8 0 . 10 9 0 . 20 10 0 . 30 11 0 . 40 12 0 . 50 13 0 . 05 100 BAU / ml 14 0 . 10 15 0 . 20 16 0 . 30 17 0 . 40 18 0 . 50 19 0 . 05 1 , 000 BAU / ml 20 0 . 10 21 0 . 20 22 0 . 30 23 0 . 40 24 0 . 50 25 0 . 05 10 , 000 BAU / ml 26 0 . 10 27 0 . 20 28 0 . 30 29 0 . 40 30 0 . 50 31 0 . 05 100 , 000 BAU / ml 32 0 . 10 33 0 . 20 34 0 . 30 35 0 . 40 Gradually increase the dose as outlined in the schedule .
If you give a dose that causes a mild local reaction ( manifested by warmth or redness ) repeat the same dose .
If the reaction is severe or systemic ( manifested as hives , asthma , or hay fever ) drop back a dose in schedule and build again .
If a severe local reaction or a systemic reaction is again encountered , this should be considered more than the maximum tolerance for this patient .
The maintenance dose is the largest dose that relieves symptoms without producing local reactions .
The size and interval of doses will vary and can be adjusted as necessary .
The normal interval between doses is 4 to 7 days .
The usual duration of treatment has not been established .
A period of two or three years of injection therapy constitutes an average minimum course of treatment .
