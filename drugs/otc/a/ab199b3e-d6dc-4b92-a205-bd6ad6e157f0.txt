8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] , TAZVERIK can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women .
There are no available data on TAZVERIK use in pregnant women to inform the drug - associated risk .
Administration of tazemetostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in dose - dependent increases in skeletal developmental abnormalities in both species beginning at maternal exposures approximately 1 . 5 times the adult human exposure [ AUC0 - 45 h ] at the 800 mg twice daily dose ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In pregnant rats , once daily oral administration of tazemetostat during the period of organogenesis from gestation day ( GD ) 7 through 17 resulted in no maternal adverse effects at doses up to 100 mg / kg / day ( approximately 6 times the adult human exposure at 800 mg twice daily ) .
Skeletal malformations and variations occurred in fetuses at doses of ≥ 50 mg / kg ( approximately 2 times the adult human exposure at the 800 mg twice daily dose ) .
At 200 mg / kg ( approximately 14 times the adult human exposure at the 800 mg twice daily dose ) , major findings included increased post implantation loss , missing digits , fused vertebrae , domed heads and fused bones of the skull , and reduced fetal body weights .
In pregnant rabbits , no adverse maternal effects were observed after once daily oral administration of 400 mg / kg / day tazemetostat ( approximately 7 times the adult human exposure at the 800 mg twice daily dose ) from GD 7 through 19 .
Skeletal variations were present at doses ≥ 100 mg / kg / day ( approximately 1 . 5 times the adult human exposure at the 800 mg twice daily dose ) , with skeletal malformations at ≥ 200 mg / kg / day ( approximately 5 . 6 times the adult human exposure at the 800 mg twice daily dose ) .
At 400 mg / kg ( approximately 7 times the adult human exposure at the 800 mg twice daily dose ) , major findings included increased post implantation loss and cleft palate and snout .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no animal or human data on the presence of tazemetostat in human milk or on its effects on the breastfed child or milk production .

11 DESCRIPTION Tazemetostat is a methyltransferase inhibitor .
Tazemetostat hydrobromide has the following chemical name : [ 1 , 1 ' - Biphenyl ] - 3 - carboxamide , N - [ ( 1 , 2 - dihydro - 4 , 6 - dimethyl - 2 - oxo - 3 - pyridinyl ) methyl ] - 5 - [ ethyl ( tetrahydro - 2 H - pyran - 4 - yl ) amino ] - 4 - methyl - 4 ' - ( 4 - morpholinylmethyl ) - , hydrobromide ( 1 : 1 ) .
The molecular formula of tazemetostat hydrobromide is C34H44N4O4 ∙ HBr .
Tazemetostat hydrobromide has a molecular weight of 653 . 66 g / mol and the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Tazemetostat hydrobromide is a white to off - white solid that is slightly soluble in water and has pKa values of 5 . 26 , 6 . 88 , and 12 . 62 .
A saturated aqueous solution of tazemetostat hydrobromide has a pH of approximately 5 at ambient conditions .
TAZVERIK ( tazemetostat ) tablets for oral use contain 200 mg tazemetostat , equivalent to 228 mg tazemetostat hydrobromide .
Each tablet is film - coated and contains the following inactive ingredients in the tablet core : hydroxypropyl cellulose , lactose monohydrate , low - substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose , magnesium stearate , and sodium starch glycolate .
The film - coat contains hypromellose , polyethylene glycol , red iron oxide , talc , and titanium dioxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Tazemetostat is an inhibitor of the methyltransferase , EZH2 , and some EZH2 gain - of - function mutations including Y646X , A682G , and A692V .
Tazemetostat also inhibited EZH1 with a half - maximal inhibitory concentration ( IC50 ) of 392 nM , approximately 36 times higher than the IC50 for inhibition of EZH2 .
The most well - characterized function of EZH2 is as the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) , catalyzing mono - , di - , and trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 .
Trimethylation of histone H3 leads to transcriptional repression .
SWItch / Sucrose Non - Fermentable ( SWI / SNF ) complexes can antagonize PRC2 function in the regulation of the expression of certain genes of patients with epithelioid sarcoma .
Preclinical in vitro and in vivo models with the loss or dysfunction of certain SWI / SNF complex members ( e . g . , integrase interactor 1 [ INI1 / SNF5 / SMARCB1 / BAF47 ] , SMARCA4 , and SMARCA2 ) can lead to aberrant EZH2 activity or expression and a resulting oncogenic dependence on EZH2 .
Tazemetostat suppressed proliferation of B - cell lymphoma cell lines in vitro and demonstrated antitumor activity in a mouse xenograft model of B - cell lymphoma with or without EZH2 gain - of - function mutations .
Tazemetostat demonstrated greater effects on the inhibition of proliferation of lymphoma cell lines with mutant EZH2 .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Tazemetostat exposure - response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic responses are unknown .
Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of orally administered TAZVERIK , at doses ranging from 100 mg to 1600 mg twice daily ( 0 . 125 to 2 times the approved recommended dosage ) for 15 days , on the heart - rate corrected QT ( QTc ) interval was evaluated in a dose - finding study in 38 patients with advanced malignancies .
Tazemetostat and its metabolite EPZ - 6930 did not cause a large mean increase ( i . e . > 20 ms ) on the QTc interval at the 800 mg twice daily dose .
The largest mean increase ( upper bound of 90 % confidence interval ) in QTc were 6 . 1 ms ( 8 . 5 ms ) and 9 . 3 ms ( 12 . 5 ms ) at a dose of 800 mg twice daily and 1600 mg twice daily , respectively .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The systemic exposure of tazemetostat is approximately dose proportional over the dose range of 200 mg to 1600 mg twice daily of TAZVERIK ( 0 . 25 to 2 times the approved recommended dosage ) .
Following TAZVERIK 800 mg orally twice daily , steady - state was reached by Day 15 .
The mean ( coefficient of variation [ CV ] % ) steady - state peak plasma concentration ( Cmax ) was 829 ( 56 % ) ng / mL and AUC0 - 12 h was 3340 ( 49 % ) ng • h / mL .
Tazemetostat exhibited time - dependent pharmacokinetics ( PK ) .
The mean accumulation ratio ( measured by AUC ) was 0 . 58 .
Absorption The mean absolute oral bioavailability of tazemetostat is approximately 33 % .
The median time to reach the peak plasma concentration of tazemetostat is 1 to 2 hours .
Effect of Food A high - fat , high - calorie ( approximately 800 to 1000 calories ) meal does not have a significant effect on tazemetostat exposure .
Distribution The mean ( CV % ) apparent volume of distribution at steady - state ( Vss / F ) is 1230 L ( 46 % ) .
Tazemetostat is 88 % bound to human plasma proteins in vitro .
The blood - to - plasma ratio is 0 . 73 .
Elimination At steady - state , the estimated mean ( CV % ) terminal elimination half - life of tazemetostat is 3 . 1 hours ( 14 % ) and the apparent total clearance ( CLss / F ) is 274 L / h ( 49 % ) .
Metabolism In vitro , tazemetostat is metabolized by CYP3A to form the inactive major metabolites M5 ( EPZ - 6930 ) and M3 ( EPZ006931 ) .
M5 undergoes further metabolism by CYP3A .
Excretion Following a single oral dose of radiolabeled tazemetostat , 94 % of the total radioactivity was recovered over 12 days , with 15 % excreted into urine and 79 % into feces .
Specific Populations Age ( 16 to 91 years ) , sex , race ( White , Black , Asian ) , body weight ( 37 . 3 to 173 kg ) , mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 1 to 1 . 5 times ULN or AST > ULN ) and renal impairment , including end stage renal disease , have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of tazemetostat .
The effect of moderate to severe hepatic impairment has not been studied .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors on Tazemetostat : Coadministration of fluconazole ( a moderate CYP3A inhibitor ) with TAZVERIK 400 mg twice daily in patients increased tazemetostat steady - state AUC0 - 8 h by 3 . 1 - fold and Cmax by 2 . 3 - fold .
Effect of Gastric Acid Reducing Agents on Tazemetostat : Coadministration of omeprazole ( a proton pump inhibitor ) with TAZVERIK 800 mg twice daily in patients increased tazemetostat steady - state AUC0 - 8 h by 26 % and Cmax by 25 % , which is not expected to have clinically relevant impact .
Effect of Tazemetostat on CYP3A Substrate : Coadministration of TAZVERIK 800 mg twice daily with oral midazolam ( a sensitive CYP3A substrate ) in patients decreased midazolam AUC0 - 12 h by 40 % and Cmax by 21 % .
Effect of Tazemetostat on CYP2C8 and CYP2C19 Substrates : Coadministration of TAZVERIK 800 mg twice daily with repaglinide ( a sensitive CYP2C8 substrate ) and omeprazole ( a sensitive CYP2C19 substrate ) in patients increased repaglinide AUC0 - 8 h by 80 % and Cmax by 51 % ; and had no effect on the exposure of omeprazole .
In Vitro Studies Metabolic Enzymes : Tazemetostat does not inhibit CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C9 , and CYP2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations .
Drug Transporters : Tazemetostat is a substrate of p - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) .
Tazemetostat is not a substrate of breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) ; renal transporters organic cation transporter 2 ( OCT2 ) , organic anion transporter 3 ( OAT3 ) , and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 1 ( MATE1 ) ; or hepatic transporters organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 ( OATP1B1 ) and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 ( OATP1B3 ) .
Tazemetostat is an inhibitor of MATE1 and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 2 - K ( MATE2 - K ) .
Tazemetostat does not inhibit P - gp , BCRP , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , organic cation transporter 1 ( OCT1 ) , OCT2 , organic anion transporter 1 ( OAT1 ) , OAT3 , or bile salt export pump ( BSEP ) at clinically relevant concentrations .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Dedicated carcinogenicity studies were not conducted with tazemetostat , but T - LBL , MDS , and AML have been reported clinically and T - LBL occurred in juvenile and adult rats after ~ 9 or more weeks of tazemetostat administration during 13 - week toxicity studies .
Based on nonclinical studies in rats , the risk of T - LBL appears to be greater with longer duration dosing .
Tazemetostat did not cause genetic damage in a standard battery of studies including a screening and pivotal bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay , an in vitro micronucleus assessment in human peripheral blood lymphocytes , and an in vivo micronucleus assessment in rats after oral administration .
Fertility and early embryonic development studies have not been conducted with tazemetostat ; however , an assessment of male and female reproductive organs were included in 4 - and 13 - week repeat - dose toxicity studies in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys .
Oral daily administration of tazemetostat did not result in any notable effects in the adult male and female reproductive organs [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Epithelioid Sarcoma The efficacy of TAZVERIK was evaluated in an open - label , single - arm cohort ( Cohort 5 ) of a multi - center study ( Study EZH - 202 , NCT02601950 ) in patients with histologically confirmed , metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma .
Patients were required to have INI1 loss , detected using local tests , and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) of 0 - 2 .
Patients received TAZVERIK 800 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Tumor response assessments were performed every 8 weeks .
The major efficacy outcome measures were confirmed overall response rate ( ORR ) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1 . 1 as assessed by blinded independent central review ( BICR ) and duration of response ( DOR ) .
Median duration of follow - up was 14 months ( range 0 . 4 to 31 ) .
Among the 62 patients who received TAZVERIK , median age was 34 years ( range 16 to 79 ) ; 63 % were male , 76 % were White , 11 % were Asian , 44 % had proximal disease , 92 % had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 , and 8 % had an ECOG PS of 2 .
Prior surgery occurred in 77 % of patients ; 61 % received prior systemic chemotherapy .
Efficacy results are summarized in Table 8 .

Patients were required to have ECOG PS of 0 - 2 and were enrolled based on EZH2 mutation status .
EZH2 mutations were identified prospectively using formalin - fixed , paraffin - embedded tumor samples , which were centrally tested using the cobas ® EZH2 Mutation Test ; the cobas EZH2 Mutation test is designed to detect the following mutations : Y646X [ S , H , C ] , Y646F , Y646N , A682G , and A692V .
Patients received TAZVERIK 800 mg orally twice daily until confirmed disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Tumor response assessments were performed every 8 weeks through Week 24 and then every 12 weeks .
The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DOR according to the International Working Group Non - Hodgkin Lymphoma ( IWG - NHL ) criteria1 as assessed by Independent Review Committee .
Median duration of follow - up was 22 months ( range 3 months to 44 months ) for patients with EZH2 MT positive tumors and 36 months ( range 32 months to 39 months ) for patients whose tumors did not have an EZH2 mutation detected .
A total of 99 patients were enrolled , including 45 patients whose tumors had one of these EZH2 mutations ( mutant ) and 54 patients whose tumors did not have one of these mutations ( wild - type ) .
Among the 45 patients with EZH2 mutant follicular lymphoma , median age was 62 years ( range 38 to 80 ) , 58 % were female , 42 % had early progression following front - line therapy ( POD24 ) , and all had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 .
Race was reported in 84 % of patients ; of these patients , 82 % were White .
Based on the cobas EZH2 Mutation test , 36 % , 29 % , 27 % , 11 % and 2 % of patients had the following mutations : Y646X [ S , H , C ] , Y646F , Y646N , A682G , and A692V , respectively .
The median number of lines of prior systemic therapy was 2 ( range 1 to 11 ) , with 49 % refractory to rituximab , 49 % refractory to their last therapy , and 9 % had received prior stem cell transplant .
Among the 54 patients with EZH2 wild - type follicular lymphoma , median age was 61 years ( range 36 to 87 ) , 63 % were male , 59 % had POD24 , and 91 % had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 .
Race was reported in 57 % of patients ; of these patients , 48 % were White and 3 % were Asian .
The median number of lines of prior systemic therapy was 3 ( range 1 to 8 ) , with 59 % refractory to rituximab , 41 % refractory to their last therapy , and 39 % had received prior stem cell transplant .
The approval of TAZVERIK was based upon the efficacy in 95 patients ( 42 EZH2 Mutant , 53 EZH2 Wild - Type ) who had received at least 2 prior systemic therapies and is presented in Table 9 .
