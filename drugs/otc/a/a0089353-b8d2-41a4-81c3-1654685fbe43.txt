DESCRIPTION Pyridostigmine bromide is an orally active cholinesterase inhibitor .
Chemically , pyridostigmine bromide is 3 - hydroxy - 1 - methylpyridinium bromide dimethylcarbamate .
Its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Pyridostigmine bromide tablets , USP is available as a 60 mg tablet for oral administration .
The tablet contains the following inactive ingredients : colloidal silicon dioxide , lactose anhydrous , magnesium stearate and stearic acid .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pyridostigmine bromide inhibits the destruction of acetylcholine by cholinesterase and thereby permits freer transmission of nerve impulses across the neuromuscular junction .
Pyridostigmine is an analog of neostigmine ( Prostigmin ® ) , but differs from it in certain clinically significant respects ; for example , pyridostigmine is characterized by a longer duration of action and fewer gastrointestinal side effects .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Pyridostigmine bromide tablets are useful in the treatment of myasthenia gravis .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Pyridostigmine bromide is contraindicated in mechanical intestinal or urinary obstruction , and particular caution should be used in its administration to patients with bronchial asthma .
Care should be observed in the use of atropine for counteracting side effects , as discussed below .
WARNINGS Although failure of patients to show clinical improvement may reflect underdosage , it can also be indicative of overdosage .
As is true of all cholinergic drugs , overdosage of pyridostigmine bromide may result in cholinergic crisis , a state characterized by increasing muscle weakness which , through involvement of the muscles of respiration , may lead to death .
Myasthenic crisis due to an increase in the severity of the disease is also accompanied by extreme muscle weakness , and thus may be difficult to distinguish from cholinergic crisis on a symptomatic basis .
Such differentiation is extremely important , since increases in doses of pyridostigmine bromide or other drugs of this class in the presence of cholinergic crisis or of a refractory or “ insensitive ” state could have grave consequences .
Osserman and Genkins1 indicate that the differential diagnosis of the two types of crisis may require the use of Tensilon ® ( edrophonium chloride ) as well as clinical judgment .
The treatment of the two conditions obviously differs radically .
Whereas the presence of myasthenic crisis suggests the need for more intensive anticholinesterase therapy , the diagnosis of cholinergic crisis , according to Osserman and Genkins1 , calls for the prompt withdrawal of all drugs of this type .
The immediate use of atropine in cholinergic crisis is also recommended .
Atropine may also be used to abolish or obtund gastrointestinal side effects or other muscarinic reactions ; but such use , by masking signs of overdosage , can lead to inadvertent induction of cholinergic crisis .
For detailed information on the management of patients with myasthenia gravis , the physician is referred to one of the excellent reviews such as those by Osserman and Genkins2 , Grob3 or Schwab4 , 5 .
PRECAUTIONS Pyridostigmine is mainly excreted unchanged by the kidney6 , 7 , 8 .
Therefore , lower doses may be required in patients with renal disease , and treatment should be based on titration of drug dosage to effect6 , 7 .
Pregnancy The safety of pyridostigmine bromide during pregnancy or lactation in humans has not been established .
Therefore , use of pyridostigmine bromide in women who may become pregnant requires weighing the drug ' s potential benefits against its possible hazards to mother and child .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
ADVERSE REACTIONS The side effects of pyridostigmine bromide are most commonly related to overdosage and generally are of two varieties , muscarinic and nicotinic .
Among those in the former group are nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , abdominal cramps , increased peristalsis , increased salivation , increased bronchial secretions , miosis and diaphoresis .
Nicotinic side effects are comprised chiefly of muscle cramps , fasciculation and weakness .
Muscarinic side effects can usually be counteracted by atropine , but for reasons shown in the preceding section the expedient is not without danger .
As with any compound containing the bromide radical , a skin rash may be seen in an occasional patient .
Such reactions usually subside promptly upon discontinuance of the medication .

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Pyridostigmine bromide is available in tablets , each containing 60 mg pyridostigmine bromide .
Dosage : The size and frequency of the dosage must be adjusted to the needs of the individual patient .
The average dose is ten 60 - mg tablets daily , spaced to provide maximum relief when maximum strength is needed .
In severe cases as many as 25 tablets a day may be required , while in mild cases one to six tablets a day may suffice .
Note : For information on a diagnostic test for myasthenia gravis , and for the evaluation and stabilization of therapy , please see product literature on Tensilon ® ( edrophonium chloride ) .
