( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Reversible HPA axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal of treatment , Cushing ’ s syndrome , and hyperglycemia may occur due to systemic absorption .
Patients applying a topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression .
Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop .
Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity .
( 5 . 1 , 8 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Effects on Endocrine System Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamicpituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency .
This may occur during treatment or after withdrawal of treatment .
Manifestations of Cushing ’ s syndrome , hyperglycemia , and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment .
Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of high - potency steroids , large treatment surface areas , prolonged use , use of occlusive dressings , altered skin barrier , liver failure , and young age .
Because of the potential for systemic absorption , use of topical corticosteroids may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression .
This may be done by using the adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) stimulation test .
In a study evaluating the effects of mometasone furoate ointment on the HPA axis , 15 grams were applied twice daily for 7 days to 6 adult subjects with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis .
The results show that the drug caused a slight lowering of adrenal corticosteroid secretion .
If HPA axis suppression is documented , an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug , to reduce the frequency of application , or to substitute a less potent corticosteroid .
Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids .
Infrequently , signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur , requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids .
Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 2 Allergic Contact Dermatitis If irritation develops , Mometasone Furoate Ointment USP , 0 . 1 % should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted .
Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation .
Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing .
5 . 3 Concomitant Skin Infections If concomitant skin infections are present or develop , an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used .
If a favorable response does not occur promptly , use of Mometasone Furoate Ointment USP , 0 . 1 % should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
In controlled clinical trials involving 812 subjects , the incidence of adverse reactions associated with the use of mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % was 4 . 8 % .
Reported reactions included burning , pruritus , skin atrophy , tingling / stinging , and furunculosis .
Cases of rosacea associated with the use of mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % have been reported .
The following adverse reactions were reported to be possibly or probably related to treatment with mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % during a clinical study in 5 % of 63 pediatric subjects 6 months to 2 years of age : decreased glucocorticoid levels , 1 ; an unspecified skin disorder , 1 ; and a bacterial skin infection , 1 .
The following signs of skin atrophy were also observed among 63 subjects treated with mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % in a clinical trial : shininess , 4 ; telangiectasia , 1 ; loss of elasticity , 4 ; loss of normal skin markings , 4 ; and thinness , 1 .
The following additional local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids , but may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings .
These reactions are : irritation , dryness , folliculitis , hypertrichosis , acneiform eruptions , hypopigmentation , perioral dermatitis , allergic contact dermatitis , secondary infection , skin atrophy , striae , and miliaria .
Most common adverse reactions are burning , pruritus , skin atrophy , tingling / stinging and furunculosis .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug - drug interaction studies have been conducted with Mometasone Furoate Ointment USP , 0 . 1 % .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C : There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Therefore , Mometasone Furoate Ointment USP , 0 . 1 % should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels .
Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals .
When administered to pregnant rats , rabbits , and mice , mometasone furoate increased fetal malformations .
The doses that produced malformations also decreased fetal growth , as measured by lower fetal weights and / or delayed ossification .
Mometasone furoate also caused dystocia and related complications when administered to rats during the end of pregnancy .
In mice , mometasone furoate caused cleft palate at subcutaneous doses of 60 mcg / kg and above .
Fetal survival was reduced at 180 mcg / kg .
No toxicity was observed at 20 mcg / kg .
( Doses of 20 , 60 , and 180 mcg / kg in the mouse are approximately 0 . 01 , 0 . 02 , and 0 . 05 times the estimated maximum clinical topical dose from mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % on a mcg / m2 basis ) .
In rats , mometasone furoate produced umbilical hernias at topical doses of 600 mcg / kg and above .
A dose of 300 mcg / kg produced delays in ossification , but no malformations .
( Doses of 300 and 600 mcg / kg in the rat are approximately 0 . 2 and 0 . 4 times the estimated maximum clinical topical dose from mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % on a mcg / m2 basis ) .
In rabbits , mometasone furoate caused multiple malformations ( e . g . , flexed front paws , gallbladder agenesis , umbilical hernia , hydrocephaly ) at topical doses of 150 mcg / kg and above ( approximately 0 . 2 times the estimated maximum clinical topical dose from mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % on a mcg / m2 basis ) .
In an oral study , mometasone furoate increased resorptions and caused cleft palate and / or head malformations ( hydrocephaly and domed head ) at 700 mcg / kg .
At 2800 mcg / kg most litters were aborted or resorbed .
No toxicity was observed at 140 mcg / kg .
( Doses of 140 , 700 , and 2800 mcg / kg in the rabbit are approximately 0 . 2 , 0 . 9 , and 3 . 6 times the estimated maximum clinical topical dose from mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % on a mcg / m2 basis ) .
When rats received subcutaneous doses of mometasone furoate throughout pregnancy or during the later stages of pregnancy , 15 mcg / kg caused prolonged and difficult labor and reduced the number of live births , birth weight , and early pup survival .
Similar effects were not observed at 7 . 5 mcg / kg .
( Doses of 7 . 5 and 15 mcg / kg in the rat are approximately 0 . 005 and 0 . 01 times the estimated maximum clinical topical dose from mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % on a mcg / m2 basis ) .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth , interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production , or cause other untoward effects .
It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when Mometasone Furoate Ointment USP , 0 . 1 % is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Mometasone Furoate Ointment USP , 0 . 1 % may be used with caution in pediatric patients 2 years of age or older , although the safety and efficacy of drug use for longer than 3 weeks have not been established .
Since safety and efficacy of Mometasone Furoate Ointment USP , 0 . 1 % have not been established in pediatric patients below 2 years of age , its use in this age group is not recommended .
Mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % caused HPA axis suppression in approximately 27 % of pediatric subjects ages 6 to 23 months , who showed normal adrenal function by Cortrosyn test before starting treatment , and were treated for approximately 3 weeks over a mean body surface area of 39 % ( range 15 % - 99 % ) .
The criteria for suppression were : basal cortisol level of ≤ 5 mcg / dL , 30 - minute post - stimulation level of ≤ 18 mcg / dL , or an increase of < 7 mcg / dL .
Follow - up testing 2 to 4 weeks after stopping treatment , available for 8 of the subjects , demonstrated suppressed HPA axis function in 3 subjects , using these same criteria .
Long - term use of topical corticosteroids has not been studied in this population [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass , pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA axis suppression and Cushing ’ s syndrome when they are treated with topical corticosteroids .
They are , therefore , also at greater risk of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency during and / or after withdrawal of treatment .
Pediatric patients may be more susceptible than adults to skin atrophy , including striae , when they are treated with topical corticosteroids .
Pediatric patients applying topical corticosteroids to greater than 20 % of body surface are at higher risk of HPA axis suppression .
HPA axis suppression , Cushing ’ s syndrome , linear growth retardation , delayed weight gain , and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids .
Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include low plasma cortisol levels and absence of response to ACTH stimulation .
Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles , headaches , and bilateral papilledema .
Mometasone Furoate Ointment USP , 0 . 1 % should not be used in the treatment of diaper dermatitis .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % included 310 subjects who were 65 years of age and over and 57 subjects who were 75 years of age and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects .
However , greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
10 OVERDOSAGE Topically applied Mometasone Furoate Ointment USP , 0 . 1 % can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to produce systemic effects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION Mometasone Furoate Ointment USP , 0 . 1 % contains mometasone furoate for topical use .
Mometasone furoate is a synthetic corticosteroid with anti - inflammatory activity .
Chemically , mometasone furoate is 9α , 21 - dichloro - 11β , 17 - dihydroxy - 16α - methylpregna - 1 , 4 - diene - 3 , 20 - dione 17 - ( 2 - furoate ) , with the empirical formula C27H30CI2O6 , a molecular weight of 521 . 4 and the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Mometasone furoate is a white to off - white powder practically insoluble in water , slightly soluble in octanol , and moderately soluble in ethyl alcohol .
Each gram of Mometasone Furoate Ointment USP , 0 . 1 % contains 1 mg mometasone furoate in a white to off - white uniform ointment base of hexylene glycol , phosphoric acid , propylene glycol stearate ( 55 % monoester ) , purified water , white wax , and white petrolatum .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Like other topical corticosteroids , mometasone furoate has anti - inflammatory , antipruritic , and vasoconstrictive properties .
The mechanism of the anti - inflammatory activity of the topical steroids , in general , is unclear .
However , corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins , collectively called lipocortins .
It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid .
Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Studies performed with mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % indicate that it is in the medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids .
In a study evaluating the effects of mometasone furoate ointment on the HPA axis , 15 grams were applied twice daily for 7 days to 6 adult subjects with psoriasis or atopic dermatitis .
The ointment was applied without occlusion to at least 30 % of the body surface .
The results showed that the drug caused a slight lowering of adrenal corticosteroid secretion [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Sixty - three pediatric subjects ages 6 to 23 months , with atopic dermatitis , were enrolled in an open - label HPA axis safety study .
Mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % was applied once daily for approximately 3 weeks over a mean body surface area of 39 % ( range 15 % - 99 % ) .
In approximately 27 % of subjects who showed normal adrenal function by Cortrosyn test before starting treatment , adrenal suppression was observed at the end of treatment with mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % .
The criteria for suppression were : basal cortisol level of ≤ 5 mcg / dL , 30 - minute post - stimulation level of ≤ 18 mcg / dL , or an increase of < 7 mcg / dL .
Follow - up testing 2 to 4 weeks after stopping treatment , available for 8 of the subjects , demonstrated suppressed HPA axis function in 3 subjects , using these same criteria [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier .
Studies in humans indicate that approximately 0 . 7 % of the applied dose of mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % enters the circulation after 8 hours of contact on normal skin without occlusion .
Inflammation and / or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % .
Long - term carcinogenicity studies of mometasone furoate were conducted by the inhalation route in rats and mice .
In a 2 - year carcinogenicity study in Sprague Dawley rats , mometasone furoate demonstrated no statistically significant increase of tumors at inhalation doses up to 67 mcg / kg ( approximately 0 . 04 times the estimated maximum clinical topical dose from mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % on a mcg / m2 basis ) .
In a 19 - month carcinogenicity study in Swiss CD - 1 mice , mometasone furoate demonstrated no statistically significant increase in the incidence of tumors at inhalation doses up to 160 mcg / kg ( approximately 0 . 05 times the estimated maximum clinical topical dose from mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % on a mcg / m2 basis ) .
Mometasone furoate increased chromosomal aberrations in an in vitro Chinese hamster ovary cell assay , but did not increase chromosomal aberrations in an in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay .
Mometasone furoate was not mutagenic in the Ames test or mouse lymphoma assay , and was not clastogenic in an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay , a rat bone marrow chromosomal aberration assay , or a mouse male germ - cell chromosomal aberration assay .
Mometasone furoate also did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in vivo in rat hepatocytes .
In reproductive studies in rats , impairment of fertility was not produced in male or female rats by subcutaneous doses up to 15 mcg / kg ( approximately 0 . 01 times the estimated maximum clinical topical dose from mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % on a mcg / m2 basis ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % for the treatment of corticosteroid - responsive dermatoses was demonstrated in two vehicle - controlled trials , one in psoriasis and one in atopic dermatitis .
A total of 218 subjects received mometasone furoate ointment , 0 . 1 % ( 109 subjects ) or the vehicle ointment applied once daily for 21 days .
