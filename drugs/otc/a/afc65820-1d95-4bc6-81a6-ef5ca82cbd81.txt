CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Studies indicate allergic individuals produce immunoglobulins of the IgE class in response to exposure to allergens .
Subsequent exposure to the same allergen results in a complex of allergen with IgE antibody fixed on mast cells or basophil membranes .
This cross - linking results in stimulation of mast cells which leads to release and generation of pharmacologically active substances that produce immediate hypersensitivity reaction . 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE FOR DIAGNOSTIC USE ONLY .
This product has not been shown by adequate data to be safe and effective for therapeutic use according to Federal Register Notice dated November 16 , 1994 , Vol .
59 , No . 220 .
The following allergenic extracts are " For Diagnostic Use Only " : Coffee ( Coffea arabic ) , Cottonseed ( Gossypium spp . )
, Flaxseed ( Linum usitatissimum ) , Leafhopper ( Cicadellidae ) , Miller Moth ( Night Flying Lepidoptera ) , Cricket ( Gryllidae ) and Moth ( Frenatae ) .
These extracts are intended for diagnostic testing of patients whose histories indicate that upon natural exposure to the allergen , they experience allergic symptoms .
Confirmation is determined by skin testing .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not administer in the presence of diseases characterized by bleeding diathesis .
Individuals with autoimmune disease may be at risk of exacerbating symptoms of the underlying condition , possibly due to routine immunization .
Children with nephrotic syndrome should not receive injections due to immunization exacerbating nephrotic diseases .
Allergenic extracts are not intended for diagnosing patients who do not manifest immediate hypersensitivity reactions to the allergenic extract when skin tested .
WARNINGS Extreme caution is necessary when using diagnostic skin tests in highly sensitive patients who have experienced severe symptoms or anaphylaxis by natural exposure or previous skin testing or treatment .
IN THESE CASES THE POTENCY FOR SKIN TESTS MUST BE ADJUSTED TO THE PATIENT ' S SENSITIVITY AND TOLERANCE .
Refer to boxed “ WARNINGS " and “ OVERDOSAGE " sections .
Epinephrine 1 : 1000 should be available when a new lot of allergenic extract is utilized .
Patient re - evaluation may be necessary .
Injections should never be given intravenously .
Adverse reactions to allergenic extracts are usually apparent within 20 - 30 minutes following skin testing .
Patients should be observed for 20 - 30 minutes after skin testing .
PRECAUTIONS General : Sterile solutions , vials , syringes , etc . must be used .
Aseptic technique should be observed in making dilutions for skin testing .
DO NOT INJECT INTRAVENOUSLY Observe caution in making test injection to minimize adverse reactions .
The usual precautions in administering allergenic extracts are necessary ( refer to boxed " WARNINGS " and " OVERDOSAGE " sections ) .
A disposable , sterile syringe and needle should be used for each individual patient to prevent transmission of serum hepatitis , Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) and other infectious agents .
It cannot be overemphasized that , under certain unpredictable combinations of circumstances , anaphylactic shock is always a possibility .
Other possible systemic reaction symptoms are , in varying degrees of severity : fainting , pallor , bradycardia , hypotension , angioedema , cough , wheezing , conjunctivitis , rhinitis , and urticaria . 4 , 5 With careful attention to administration , such reactions occur infrequently , but it must be remembered that allergenic extracts are highly potent to sensitive individuals and overdose could result in anaphylactic symptoms .
Therefore , it is imperative that physicians administering allergenic extracts understand and be prepared for the treatment of severe reactions .
Refer to " OVERDOSAGE " section for a description of the treatment of anaphylactic reactions .
Information for Patients : Patients should remain under observation of nurse , physician , or other personnel trained in emergency measures for at least 20 minutes following testing .
Any adverse reactions during or after leaving the office should be reported to the physician or their qualified personnel .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Long term studies in animals have not been conducted with allergenic extract to determine their potential for carcinogenicity , mutagenicity or impairment of fertility .
Pregnancy Category C : Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with allergenic extracts .
It is not known whether allergenic extracts cause fetal harm during pregnancy or affect reproductive capacity .
A systemic reaction to allergenic extract could cause uterine contractions leading to spontaneous abortion or premature labor .
Allergenic extracts should be used during pregnancy only if potential benefit justifies potential risk to fetus . 3 Nursing Mothers : It is not known whether allergenic extracts are excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when allergenic extracts are administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use : Allergenic extracts have been used routinely in children , and no special safety problems or specific hazards have been found . 7 , 8 Drug Interactions : Antihistamines .
Antihistamines inhibit the wheal and flare reaction .
The inhibitory effect of conventional antihistamines varies from 1 day up to 10 days , according to the drug and patient ' s sensitivity .
Long acting antihistamines ( e . g . , astemizole ) may inhibit the wheal and flare for up to forty days .
Imipramines , phenothiazines , and tranquilizers .
Tricyclic antidepressants exert a potent and sustained decrease of skin reactions to histamine that may last for a few weeks .
Tranquilizers and antiemetic agents of the phenothiazine class have H1 antihistaminic activity and can block skin tests . 2 Corticosteroids .
Short - term ( less than 1 week ) administration of corticosteroids at the therapeutic doses used in asthmatic patients does not modify the cutaneous reactivity to histamine , compound 48 / 80 , or allergen .
Long - term corticosteroid therapy modifies the skin texture and makes the interpretation of immediate skin tests more difftcult . 2 Theophylline .
It appears that theophylline need not be stopped prior to skin testing .
2 Beta - adrenergic agents .
Inhaled beta2 agonists in the routine doses for the treatment of asthma do not usually inhibit allergen - induced skin tests .
However , oral terbutaline and parenteral ephedrine were shown to decrease the allergen - induced wheal . 2 Cromolyn .
Cromolyn inhaled or injected prior to skin tests with allergens or degranulating agents does not alter the skin whealing response . 2 Other drugs .
Other drugs have been shown to decrease skin test reactivity .
Among them , dopamine is the best - documented compound . 2 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions include , but are not necessarily limited to urticaria , itching , edema of the extremities , respiratory wheezing or asthma , dyspnea , cyanosis , tachycardia , lacrimation , marked perspiration , flushing of the face , neck or upper chest , mild persistent clearing of the throat , hacking cough or persistent sneezing .
1 ) Local Reactions A small amount of erythema and swelling at the site of injection is common , the extent varying with the patient .
Such reactions should not be considered significant unless they persist for at least 24 hours or exceed 50 mm in diameter .
Large , persistent local reactions or minor exacerbations of the patient ' s allergic symptoms may be treated by local cold applications and / or the use of oral antihistamines , but they should be considered a warning of possible severe systemic reactions .
A mild burning immediately after the injection is to be expected ; this usually is relieved in 10 - 20 seconds .
2 ) Systemic Reactions Systemic reactions may range from mild exaggeration of the patient ' s allergic symptoms to anaphylactic reactions .
Very sensitive patients may show a rapid response .
In some instances , a severe systemic reaction with blood pressure fall and / or shock may occur .
Quantitation of patient ' s sensitivity combined with careful early observation is essential for safe skin testing . 9 Patients receiving beta - blockers may not be responsive to epinephrine or inhaled bronchodilators .
The following are commonly prescribed beta - blockers : Levatol , Lopressor , Propanolol Intersol , Propanolol HCL , Blocadren , Propanolol , Inderal - LA , Visken , Corgard , Ipran , Tenormin , Timoptic .
Ophthalmic beta - blockers : Betaxolol , Levobunolol , Timolol , Timoptic .
Chemicals that are beta - blockers and may be components of other drugs : Acebutolol , Atenolol , Esmolol , Metoprolol , Nadolol , Penbutolol , Pindolol , Propanolol , Timolol , Labetalol , Carteolol .
OVERDOSAGE Refer to “ WARNINGS , " " PRECAUTIONS " and " ADVERSE REACTIONS " sections for signs and symptoms of an overdose .
If a systemic or anaphylactic reaction does occur , the first treatment should be injection intramuscularly or subcutaneously 0 . 3 to 0 . 5 ml of 1 : 1000 epinephrine - hydrochloride into the opposite arm or gluteal area .
Apply tourniquet above site of allergenic extract injection and loosen briefly at 5 minute intervals to prevent circulatory impairment .
If oxygen is indicated , it may be administered by nasal cannula or ambu bag .
The epinephrine HCL 1 : 1000 dose for infants to 2 years is 0 . 05 to 0 . 1 ml ; for children 2 to 6 years it is 0 . 15 ml ; for children 6 to 12 years it is 0 . 2 ml .
Symptoms of progressive anaphylaxis include airway obstruction and / or vascular collapse .
After administration of epinephrine , profound shock and vasomotor collapse should be treated with intravenous fluids and possibly vasoactive drugs .
Monitor airways for obstruction .
Oxygen should be given by mask if indicated .
Antihistamines , H2 antagonist , bronchodilators , steroids and theophylline may be used as indicated after giving adequate epinephrine and circulatory support . 6 Patients who have been taking a beta - blocker may be unresponsive to epinephrine .
Epinephrine or beta - adrenergic drugs ( Alupent ) may be ineffective .
These drugs should be administered even though a beta - blocker may have been taken .
The following treatment will be effective whether or not patient is taking a beta - blocker : Aminophylline IV , slow push or drip , Atrovent ( Ipratropium bromide ) Inhaler , 3 inhalations repeated , Atropine , 0 . 4 mg / ml , 0 . 75 to 1 . 5 ml IM or IV , Solu - Cortef , 100 - 200 mg IM or IV , Solu - Medrol , 125 mg IM or IV , Glucagon , 0 . 5 - 1 mg IM or IV , Benadryl , 50 mg IM or IV , Cimetidine , 300 mg IM or IV , Oxygen via ambu bag .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
Some allergenic extracts naturally precipitate .
This allergenic extract is " For Diagnostic Use Only " .
( Refer to STORAGE section . )
PRICK - PUNCTURE TESTING : To identify highly sensitive individuals and as a safety precaution , it is recommended that a prick - puncture test using a drop of the extract concentrate be performed prior to initiating very dilute intradermal testing .
Prick - puncture testing is performed by placing a drop of extract concentrate on the skin and puncturing the skin through the drop with a small needle such as a bifurcated vaccinating needle .
The most satisfactory sites on the back for skin testing are from the posterior axillary fold to 2 . 5 cm from the spinal column , and from the top of the scapula to the lower rib margins .
The best areas on the arms are the volar surfaces from the axilla to 2 . 5 or 5 cm above the wrist , skipping the anticubital space .
Skin testing should include a positive control of histamine phosphate and a negative control of 50 % v / v glycerine in buffered saline .
A positive reaction is approximately 10 - 15 mm erythema with 2 . 5 mm wheal .
Smaller , less conclusive reactions may be considered positive in conjunction with a definitive history of symptoms on exposure to the allergen .
Less sensitive individuals can be tested intradermally with an appropriately diluted extract ( See " INTRADERMAL TESTING " ) .
INTRADERMAL TESTING : The surface of the upper and lower arm is the usual location for skin testing .
A sterile , disposable syringe and needle is used for each extract tested .
Intracutaneous test dilutions , five - fold or ten - fold , may be prepared from stock concentrate using physiologic saline as a diluent .
( 1 ) Start testing with the most dilute allergenic extract concentration .
( 2 ) A volume of 0 . 02 - 0 . 05 ml should be injected slowly into the superficial skin layers making a small bleb ( superficial wheal ) .
( 3 ) For patients without a history of extreme sensitivity , or a negative or weakly reactive prick - puncture test , the initial dilution for skin testing should be at least 1 : 12 , 500 w / v .
This initial dilution can be prepared by diluting 1 : 20 to 1 : 50 w / v ( 2 % - 5 % ) extracts five - fold to 5 - 4 or 1 : 10 w / v ( 10 % ) extracts to 5 - 5 .
Dilute 1 : 10 w / v ( 10 % ) extracts to 10 - 3 if using ten - fold dilutions .
( 4 ) Sensitive patients with a positive prick - puncture test require a further dilution to at least 1 : 312 , 500 w / v .
This dilution can be prepared by diluting 1 : 20 to 1 : 50 w / v ( 2 % - 5 % ) extracts to 5 - 6 or 1 : 10 w / v ( 10 % ) extracts to 5 - 7 ( five - fold dilutions ) .
Ten - fold dilution to 10 - 6 of a 1 : 10 w / v ( 10 % ) extract would be a safe starting dilution .
For interpretation of skin reactions , refer to chart below .
If after 20 minutes no skin reaction is observed , continue testing using increasing increments of the concentration until a reaction of 5 - 10 mm wheal and 11 - 30 mm erythema is obtained , or a concentration of 5 - 2 or 10 - 1 has been tested .
A negative control , 50 % glycerine diluted with diluent to 5 - 2 ( 1 : 25 ) or 10 - 1 ( 1 : 10 ) dilution and a positive control of histamine phosphate , should be tested and included in interpretation of skin reactions . 2 , 4 GRADE mm ERYTHEMA mm WHEAL 0 less than 5 less than 5 ± 5 - 10 5 - 10 1 + 11 - 20 5 - 10 2 + 21 - 30 5 - 10 3 + 31 - 40 10 - 15 or with pseudopods 4 + greater than 40 greater than 15 or with many pseudopods INTRADERMAL TESTING – SKIN ENDPOINT TITRATION : The allergenic extracts to which the patient is sensitive and the patient ' s degree of sensitivity can be determined through the use of intracutaneous skin tests involving progressive five - fold dilutions of allergenic extracts .
Intracutaneously inject 0 . 01 to 0 . 02 ml of the test allergen to form a 4 mm diameter superficial skin wheal .
For patients demonstrating a negative or weakly reactive prick - puncture skin test , an initial screening dilution of 1 : 12 , 500 w / v is safe .
For patients demonstrating a positive prick - puncture skin test , an initial screening dilution of 1 : 312 , 500 w / v is safe ( see " Serial Dilution Titration Test Dilutions " chart below ) .
When a sequence of five - fold or ten - fold dilutions of an allergen is injected , the endpoint is determined by noting the dilution that first produces a wheal or erythema ( 15 minutes after injection ) that is 2 mm larger than wheals with erythema produced by weaker , non - reacting dilutions ( 5 mm negative wheal ) .
