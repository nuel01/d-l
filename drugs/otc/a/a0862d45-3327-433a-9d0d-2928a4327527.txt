The chemical name for nelfinavir mesylate is [ 3 S - [ 2 ( 2 S * , 3 S * ) , 3α , 4aβ , 8aβ ] ] - N - ( 1 , 1 - dimethylethyl ) decahydro - 2 - [ 2 - hydroxy - 3 - [ ( 3 - hydroxy - 2 - methylbenzoyl ) amino ] - 4 - ( phenylthio ) butyl ] - 3 - isoquinoline carboxamide mono - methanesulfonate ( salt ) and the molecular weight is 663 . 90 ( 567 . 79 as the free base ) .
Nelfinavir mesylate has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Nelfinavir mesylate is a white to off - white amorphous powder , slightly soluble in water at pH ≤ 4 and freely soluble in methanol , ethanol , 2 - propanol and propylene glycol .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action Nelfinavir is an inhibitor of the HIV - 1 protease .
Inhibition of the viral protease prevents cleavage of the gag and gag - pol polyprotein resulting in the production of immature , non - infectious virus .
Antiviral Activity In Vitro The antiviral activity of nelfinavir in vitro has been demonstrated in both acute and / or chronic HIV infections in lymphoblastoid cell lines , peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes / macrophages .
Nelfinavir was found to be active against several laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HIV - 1 and the HIV - 2 strain ROD .
The EC95 ( 95 % effective concentration ) of nelfinavir ranged from 7 to 196 nM .
Drug combination studies with protease inhibitors showed nelfinavir had antagonistic interactions with indinavir , additive interactions with ritonavir or saquinavir and synergistic interactions with amprenavir and lopinavir .
Minimal to no cellular cytotoxicity was observed with any of these protease inhibitors alone or in combination with nelfinavir .
In combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors , nelfinavir demonstrated additive ( didanosine or stavudine ) to synergistic ( abacavir , delavirdine , efavirenz , emtricitabine , lamivudine , nevirapine , tenofovir , zalcitabine or zidovudine ) antiviral activity in vitro without enhanced cytotoxicity .
Nelfinavir ' s anti - HIV activity was not antagonized by the anti - HCV drug ribavirin .
Drug Resistance HIV - 1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to nelfinavir have been selected in vitro .
HIV isolates from selected patients treated with nelfinavir alone or in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors were monitored for phenotypic ( n = 19 ) and genotypic ( n = 195 , 157 of which were evaluable ) changes in clinical trials over a period of 2 to 82 weeks .
One or more viral protease mutations at amino acid positions 30 , 35 , 36 , 46 , 71 , 77 and 88 were detected in the HIV - 1 of > 10 % of patients with evaluable isolates .
The overall incidence of the D30N mutation in the viral protease of evaluable isolates ( n = 157 ) from patients receiving nelfinavir monotherapy or nelfinavir in combination with zidovudine and lamivudine or stavudine was 54 . 8 % .
The overall incidence of other mutations associated with primary protease inhibitor resistance was 9 . 6 % for the L90M substitution whereas substitutions at 48 , 82 , or 84 were not observed .
Of the 19 clinical isolates for which both phenotypic and genotypic analyses were performed , 9 showed reduced susceptibility ( 5 - to 93 - fold ) to nelfinavir in vitro .
All 9 patient isolates possessed one or more mutations in the viral protease gene .
Amino acid position 30 appeared to be the most frequent mutation site .
Cross - resistance Non - clinical Studies Patient - derived recombinant HIV isolates containing the D30N mutation ( n = 4 ) and demonstrating high - level ( > 10 - fold ) NFV - resistance remained susceptible ( < 2 . 5 - fold resistance ) to amprenavir , indinavir , lopinavir , and saquinavir , in vitro .
Patient - derived recombinant HIV isolates containing the L90M mutation ( n = 8 ) demonstrated moderate to high - level resistance to NFV and had varying levels of susceptibility to amprenavir , indinavir , lopinavir , and saquinavir , in vitro .
Most patient - derived recombinant isolates with phenotypic and genotypic evidence of reduced susceptibility ( > 2 . 5 - fold ) to amprenavir , indinavir , lopinavir , and / or saquinavir demonstrated high - level cross - resistance to nelfinavir , in vitro .
Mutations associated with resistance to other PIs ( e . g . G48V , V82A / F / T , I84V , L90M ) appeared to confer high - level cross - resistance to NFV .
Following ritonavir therapy 6 of 7 clinical isolates with decreased ritonavir susceptibility ( 8 - to 113 - fold ) in vitro compared to baseline also exhibited decreased susceptibility to nelfinavir in vitro ( 5 - to 40 - fold ) .
Cross - resistance between nelfinavir and reverse transcriptase inhibitors is unlikely because different enzyme targets are involved .
Clinical isolates ( n = 5 ) with decreased susceptibility to lamivudine , nevirapine or zidovudine remain fully susceptible to nelfinavir in vitro .
Clinical Studies There have been no controlled or comparative studies evaluating the virologic response to subsequent protease inhibitor - containing regimens in patients who have demonstrated loss of virologic response to a nelfinavir - containing regimen .
However , virologic response was evaluated in a single - arm prospective study of 26 patients with extensive prior antiretroviral experience with reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( mean 2 . 9 ) who had received VIRACEPT for a mean duration of 59 . 7 weeks and were switched to a ritonavir ( 400 mg BID ) / saquinavir hard - gel ( 400 mg BID ) containing regimen after a prolonged period of VIRACEPT failure ( median 48 weeks ) .
Sequence analysis of HIV - 1 isolates prior to switch demonstrated a D30N or an L90M substitution in 18 and 6 patients , respectively .
Subjects remained on therapy for a mean of 48 weeks ( range 40 to 56 weeks ) where 17 of 26 ( 65 % ) subjects and 13 of 26 ( 50 % ) subjects were treatment responders with HIV RNA below the assay limit of detection ( < 500 HIV RNA copies / mL , Chiron bDNA ) at 24 and 48 weeks , respectively .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic properties of nelfinavir were evaluated in healthy volunteers and HIV - infected patients ; no substantial differences were observed between the two groups .
Absorption Pharmacokinetic parameters of nelfinavir ( area under the plasma concentration - time curve during a 24 - hour period at steady - state [ AUC24 ] , peak plasma concentrations [ Cmax ] , morning and evening trough concentrations [ Ctrough ] ) from a pharmacokinetic study in HIV - positive patients after multiple dosing with 1250 mg ( five 250 mg tablets ) twice daily ( BID ) for 28 days ( 10 patients ) and 750 mg ( three 250 mg tablets ) three times daily ( TID ) for 28 days ( 11 patients ) are summarized in Table 1 .

In healthy volunteers receiving a single 1250 mg dose , the 625 mg tablet was not bioequivalent to the 250 mg tablet formulation .
Under fasted conditions ( n = 27 ) , the AUC and Cmax were 34 % and 24 % higher , respectively , for the 625 mg tablets .
In a relative bioavailability assessment under fed conditions ( n = 28 ) , the AUC was 24 % higher for the 625 mg tablet ; the Cmax was comparable for both formulations .
In HIV - 1 infected subjects ( N = 21 ) receiving multiple doses of 1250 mg BID under fed conditions , the 625 mg formulation was bioequivalent to the 250 mg formulation based on similarity in steady state exposure ( Cmax and AUC ) .
Table 2 shows the summary of the steady state pharmacokinetic parameters ( mean ± SD ) of nelfinavir after multiple dose administration of 1250 mg BID ( 2 × 625 tablets ) to HIV - infected patients ( N = 21 ) for 14 days .

Effect of Food on Oral Absorption Food increases nelfinavir exposure and decreases nelfinavir pharmacokinetic variability relative to the fasted state .
In one study , healthy volunteers received a single dose of 1250 mg of VIRACEPT 250 mg tablets ( 5 tablets ) under fasted or fed conditions ( three different meals ) .
In a second study , healthy volunteers received single doses of 1250 mg VIRACEPT ( 5 × 250 mg tablets ) under fasted or fed conditions ( two different fat content meals ) .
The results from the two studies are summarized in Table 3 and Table 4 , respectively .

A food effect study has not been conducted with the 625 mg tablet .
However , based on a cross - study comparison ( n = 26 fed vs . n = 26 fasted ) following single dose administration of nelfinavir 1250 mg , the magnitude of the food effect for the 625 mg nelfinavir tablet appears comparable to that of the 250 mg tablets .
VIRACEPT should be taken with a meal .
Distribution The apparent volume of distribution following oral administration of nelfinavir was 2 – 7 L / kg .
Nelfinavir in serum is extensively protein - bound ( > 98 % ) .
Metabolism Unchanged nelfinavir comprised 82 – 86 % of the total plasma radioactivity after a single oral 750 mg dose of 14 C - nelfinavir .
In vitro , multiple cytochrome P - 450 enzymes including CYP3A and CYP2C19 are responsible for metabolism of nelfinavir .
One major and several minor oxidative metabolites were found in plasma .
The major oxidative metabolite has in vitro antiviral activity comparable to the parent drug .
Elimination The terminal half - life in plasma was typically 3 . 5 to 5 hours .
The majority ( 87 % ) of an oral 750 mg dose containing 14 C - nelfinavir was recovered in the feces ; fecal radioactivity consisted of numerous oxidative metabolites ( 78 % ) and unchanged nelfinavir ( 22 % ) .
Only 1 – 2 % of the dose was recovered in urine , of which unchanged nelfinavir was the major component .
Special Populations Hepatic Insufficiency The steady - state pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir ( 1250 mg BID for 2 weeks ) was studied in HIV - seronegative subjects with mild ( Child - Pugh Class A ; n = 6 ) or moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B ; n = 6 ) hepatic impairment .
When compared with subjects with normal hepatic function , the Cmax and AUC of nelfinavir were not significantly different in subjects with mild hepatic impairment but were increased by 22 % and 62 % , respectively , in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment .
The steady - state pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir has not been studied in HIV - seronegative subjects with severe hepatic impairment .
The steady - state pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir has not been studied in HIV - positive patients with any degree of hepatic impairment .
Renal Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir have not been studied in patients with renal insufficiency ; however , less than 2 % of nelfinavir is excreted in the urine , so the impact of renal impairment on nelfinavir elimination should be minimal .
Gender and Race No significant pharmacokinetic differences have been detected between males and females .
Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been evaluated .
Pediatrics The pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir have been investigated in 5 studies in pediatric patients from birth to 13 years of age either receiving VIRACEPT three times or twice daily .
The dosing regimens and associated AUC24 values are summarized in Table 5 .

The pharmacokinetic data from Study AG1343 - 556 were more variable than data from other studies conducted in the pediatric population ; the 95 % confidence interval for AUC24 was 9 to 121 mg . hr / L . Overall , use of VIRACEPT in the pediatric population is associated with highly variable drug exposure .
The high variability may be due to inconsistent food intake in pediatric patients .
( See PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . )
Geriatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of nelfinavir have not been studied in patients over 65 years of age .
Drug Interactions ( also see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions ) CYP3A and CYP2C19 appear to be the predominant enzymes that metabolize nelfinavir in humans .
The potential ability of nelfinavir to inhibit the major human cytochrome P450 enzymes ( CYP3A , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2C9 , CYP1A2 and CYP2E1 ) has been investigated in vitro .
Only CYP3A was inhibited at concentrations in the therapeutic range .
Specific drug interaction studies were performed with nelfinavir and a number of drugs .
Table 6 summarizes the effects of nelfinavir on the geometric mean AUC , Cmax and Cmin of coadministered drugs .
Table 7 shows the effects of coadministered drugs on the geometric mean AUC , Cmax and Cmin of nelfinavir .

INDICATIONS AND USAGE VIRACEPT in combination with other antiretroviral agents is indicated for the treatment of HIV infection .
Description of Studies In the clinical studies described below , efficacy was evaluated by the percent of patients with plasma HIV RNA < 400 copies / mL ( Studies 511 and 542 ) or < 500 copies / mL ( Study ACTG 364 ) , using the Roche RT - PCR ( Amplicor ) HIV - 1 Monitor or < 50 copies / mL , using the Roche HIV - 1 Ultrasensitive assay ( Study Avanti 3 ) .
In the analysis presented in each figure , patients who terminated the study early for any reason , switched therapy due to inadequate efficacy or who had a missing HIV - RNA measurement that was either preceded or followed by a measurement above the limit of assay quantification were considered to have HIV - RNA above 400 copies / mL , above 500 copies / mL , or above 50 copies / mL at subsequent time points , depending on the assay that was used .
a . Studies in Antiretroviral Treatment Naive Patients Study 511 : VIRACEPT + zidovudine + lamivudine versus zidovudine + lamivudine Study 511 was a double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled trial comparing treatment with zidovudine ( ZDV ; 200 mg TID ) and lamivudine ( 3 TC ; 150 mg BID ) plus 2 doses of VIRACEPT ( 750 mg and 500 mg TID ) to zidovudine ( 200 mg TID ) and lamivudine ( 150 mg BID ) alone in 297 antiretroviral naive HIV - 1 infected patients ( median age 35 years [ range 21 to 63 ] , 89 % male and 78 % Caucasian ) .
Mean baseline CD4 cell count was 288 cells / mm3 and mean baseline plasma HIV RNA was 5 . 21 log10 copies / mL ( 160 , 394 copies / mL ) .

Drug Interactions ( also see PRECAUTIONS ) Nelfinavir is an inhibitor of the CYP3A enzyme .
Coadministration of VIRACEPT and drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other drug that could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effects .
Caution should be exercised when inhibitors of CYP3A , including VIRACEPT , are coadministered with drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A and that prolong the QT interval .
( See ADVERSE REACTIONS : Post - Marketing Experience . )
Nelfinavir is metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2C19 .
Coadministration of VIRACEPT and drugs that induce CYP3A or CYP2C19 may decrease nelfinavir plasma concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect .
Coadministration of VIRACEPT and drugs that inhibit CYP3A or CYP2C19 may increase nelfinavir plasma concentrations .
( Also see PRECAUTIONS : Table 10 : Drugs That Should Not Be Coadministered With VIRACEPT , Table 11 : Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions . )
Concomitant use of VIRACEPT with lovastatin or simvastatin is not recommended .
Caution should be exercised if HIV protease inhibitors , including VIRACEPT , are used concurrently with other HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors that are also metabolized by the CYP3A pathway ( e . g . , atorvastatin ) .
( Also see Tables 6 and 7 : Drug Interactions ) .
The risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis may be increased when protease inhibitors , including VIRACEPT , are used in combination with these drugs .
Particular caution should be used when prescribing sildenafil , or other PDE5 inhibitors , in patients receiving protease inhibitors , including VIRACEPT .
Coadministration of these drugs is expected to substantially increase PDE5 inhibitor concentrations and may result in an increase in PDE5 inhibitor - associated adverse events , including hypotension , visual changes , and priapism .
( See PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions and Information For Patients , and the complete prescribing information for sildenafil and other PDE5 inhibitors . )
Concomitant use of St . John ' s wort ( hypericum perforatum ) or St . John ' s wort - containing products and VIRACEPT is not recommended .
Coadministration of St . John ' s wort with protease inhibitors , including VIRACEPT , is expected to substantially decrease protease inhibitor concentrations and may result in sub - optimal levels of VIRACEPT and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to VIRACEPT or to the class of protease inhibitors .
Patients with Phenylketonuria Patients with Phenylketonuria : VIRACEPT Oral Powder contains 11 . 2 mg phenylalanine per gram of powder .
Diabetes mellitus / Hyperglycemia New onset diabetes mellitus , exacerbation of pre - existing diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia have been reported during post - marketing surveillance in HIV - infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy .
Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events .
In some cases diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred .
In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy , hyperglycemia persisted in some cases .
Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice , estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established .
PRECAUTIONS General Nelfinavir is principally metabolized by the liver .
See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION when administering this drug to patients with hepatic impairment .
Resistance / Cross Resistance HIV cross - resistance between protease inhibitors has been observed .
( See MICROBIOLOGY . )
Hemophilia There have been reports of increased bleeding , including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis , in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors .
In some patients , additional factor VIII was given .
In more than half of the reported cases , treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced .
A causal relationship has not been established .
Fat Redistribution Redistribution / accumulation of body fat including central obesity , dorsocervical fat enlargement ( " buffalo hump " ) , peripheral wasting , facial wasting , breast enlargement , and " cushingoid appearance " have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy .
The mechanism and long - term consequences of these events are currently unknown .
A causal relationship has not been established .
Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy , including VIRACEPT .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia ( PCP ) , or tuberculosis ) , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
Information For Patients A statement to patients and healthcare providers is included on the product ' s bottle label : ALERT : Find out about medicines that should NOT be taken with VIRACEPT .
A Patient Package Insert ( PPI ) for VIRACEPT is available for patient information .
For optimal absorption , patients should be advised to take VIRACEPT with food ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pharmacokinetics and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Patients should be informed that VIRACEPT is not a cure for HIV infection and that they may continue to acquire illnesses associated with advanced HIV infection , including opportunistic infections .
Patients should be told that there is currently no data demonstrating that VIRACEPT therapy can reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination .
Patients should be told that sustained decreases in plasma HIV RNA have been associated with a reduced risk of progression to AIDS and death .
Patients should be advised to take VIRACEPT and other concomitant antiretroviral therapy every day as prescribed .
Patients should not alter the dose or discontinue therapy without consulting with their doctor .
If a dose of VIRACEPT is missed , patients should take the dose as soon as possible and then return to their normal schedule .
However , if a dose is skipped , the patient should not double the next dose .
Patients should be informed that VIRACEPT Tablets are film - coated and that this film - coating is intended to make the tablets easier to swallow .
The most frequent adverse event associated with VIRACEPT is diarrhea , which can usually be controlled with non - prescription drugs , such as loperamide , which slow gastrointestinal motility .
Patients should be informed that redistribution or accumulation of body fat may occur in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy and that the cause and long - term health effects of these conditions are not known at this time .
VIRACEPT may interact with some drugs ; therefore , patients should be advised to report to their doctor the use of any other prescription , non - prescription medication or herbal products , particularly St . John ' s wort .
Patients receiving oral contraceptives should be instructed that alternate or additional contraceptive measures should be used during therapy with VIRACEPT .
Patients receiving sildenafil , or other PDE5 inhibitors , and nelfinavir should be advised that they may be at an increased risk of PDE5 inhibitor - associated adverse events including hypotension , visual changes , and prolonged penile erection , and should promptly report any symptoms to their doctor .
Drug Interactions ( Also see CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Drug Interactions ) Nelfinavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A .
Coadministration of VIRACEPT and drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A ( e . g . , dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers , HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors , immunosuppressants and PDE5 inhibitors ) may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other drug that could increase or prolong both its therapeutic and adverse effects .
( See Tables 10 and 11 ) .
Nelfinavir is metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2C19 .
Coadministration of VIRACEPT and drugs that induce CYP3A or CYP2C19 , such as rifampin , may decrease nelfinavir plasma concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect .
Coadministration of VIRACEPT and drugs that inhibit CYP3A or CYP2C19 may increase nelfinavir plasma concentrations .
Drug interaction studies reveal no clinically significant drug interactions between nelfinavir and didanosine , lamivudine , stavudine , zidovudine , efavirenz , nevirapine , or ketoconazole and no dose adjustments are needed .
In the case of didanosine , it is recommended that didanosine be administered on an empty stomach ; therefore , nelfinavir should be administered with food one hour after or more than 2 hours before didanosine .
Based on known metabolic profiles , clinically significant drug interactions are not expected between VIRACEPT and dapsone , trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole , or itraconazole .

Use with increased monitoring for adverse events .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats were conducted with nelfinavir at oral doses up to 1000 mg / kg / day .
No evidence of a tumorigenic effect was noted in mice at systemic exposures ( Cmax ) up to 9 - fold those measured in humans at the recommended therapeutic dose ( 750 mg TID or 1250 mg BID ) .
In rats , thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas were increased in males at 300 mg / kg / day and higher and in females at 1000 mg / kg / day .
Systemic exposures ( Cmax ) at 300 and 1000 mg / kg / day were 1 - to 3 - fold , respectively , those measured in humans at the recommended therapeutic dose .
Repeated administration of nelfinavir to rats produced effects consistent with hepatic microsomal enzyme induction and increased thyroid hormone deposition ; these effects predispose rats , but not humans , to thyroid follicular cell neoplasms .
Nelfinavir showed no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic activity in a battery of in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicology assays .
These studies included bacterial mutation assays in S . typhimurium and E . coli , a mouse lymphoma tyrosine kinase assay , a chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes , and an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay .
Nelfinavir produced no effects on either male or female mating and fertility or embryo survival in rats at systemic exposures comparable to the human therapeutic exposure .
Pregnancy - Pregnancy Category B There were no effects on fetal development or maternal toxicity when nelfinavir was administered to pregnant rats at systemic exposures ( AUC ) comparable to human exposure .
Administration of nelfinavir to pregnant rabbits resulted in no fetal development effects up to a dose at which a slight decrease in maternal body weight was observed ; however , even at the highest dose evaluated , systemic exposure in rabbits was significantly lower than human exposure .
Additional studies in rats indicated that exposure to nelfinavir in females from mid - pregnancy through lactation had no effect on the survival , growth , and development of the offspring to weaning .
Subsequent reproductive performance of these offspring was also not affected by maternal exposure to nelfinavir .
However , there are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women taking VIRACEPT .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , VIRACEPT should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry : ( APR ) To monitor maternal - fetal outcomes of pregnant women exposed to VIRACEPT and other antiretroviral agents , an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established .
Physicians are encouraged to register patients by calling ( 800 ) 258 - 4263 .
Nursing Mothers The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that HIV - infected mothers not breast - feed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV .
Studies in lactating rats have demonstrated that nelfinavir is excreted in milk .
Because of both the potential for HIV transmission and the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants , mothers should be instructed not to breast - feed if they are receiving VIRACEPT .
Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of VIRACEPT have been established in patients from 2 to 13 years of age .
The use of VIRACEPT in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies of VIRACEPT in adults and pharmacokinetic studies and studies supporting activity in pediatric patients .
In patients less than 2 years of age , VIRACEPT was found to be safe at the doses studied , but a reliably effective dose could not be established ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Special Populations , ADVERSE REACTIONS : Pediatric Population , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : Pediatric Patients ) .
The following issues should be considered when initiating VIRACEPT in pediatric patients : • In pediatric patients ≥ 2 years of age receiving VIRACEPT as part of triple combination antiretroviral therapy in randomized studies , the proportion of patients achieving a HIV RNA level < 400 copies / mL through 48 weeks ranged from 26 % to 42 % .
• Response rates in children < 2 years of age appeared to be poorer than those in patients ≥ 2 years of age in some studies .
• Highly variable drug exposure remains a significant problem in the use of VIRACEPT in pediatric patients .
Unpredictable drug exposure may be exacerbated in pediatric patients because of increased clearance compared to adults and difficulties with compliance and adequate food intake with dosing .
Pharmacokinetic results from the pediatric studies are reported in Table 5 ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Special Populations ) .
Study 556 was a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial with VIRACEPT or placebo coadministered with ZDV and ddI in 141 HIV - positive children who had received minimal antiretroviral therapy .
The mean age of the children was 3 . 9 years .
Ninety four ( 67 % ) children were between 2 – 12 years , and 47 ( 33 % ) were < 2 years of age .
The mean baseline HIV RNA value was 5 . 0 log for all patients and the mean CD4 cell count was 886 cells / mm3 for all patients .
The efficacy of VIRACEPT measured by HIV RNA < 400 at 48 weeks in children ≥ 2 years of age was 26 % compared to 2 % of placebo patients ( p = 0 . 0008 ) .
In the children < 2 years of age , only 1 of 27 and 2 of 20 maintained an undetectable HIV RNA level at 48 weeks for placebo and VIRACEPT patients , respectively .
PACTG 377 was an open - label study that randomized 181 HIV treatment - experienced pediatric patients to receive : d4T + NVP + RTV , d4T + 3 TC + NFV , or d4T + 3 TC + NVP + NFV with NFV given on a TID schedule .
The median age was 5 . 9 years and 46 % were male .
At baseline the median HIV RNA was 4 . 4 log and median CD4 cell count was 690 cells / mm3 .
Substudy PACTG 725 evaluated d4T + 3 TC + NFV with NFV given on a BID schedule .
The proportion of patients with detectable viral load at baseline achieving HIV RNA < 400 copies / mL at 48 weeks was : 41 % for d4T + NVP + RTV , 42 % for d4T + 3 TC + NFV , 30 % for d4T + NVP + NFV , and 52 % for d4T + 3 TC + NVP + NFV .
No significant clinical differences were identified between patients receiving VIRACEPT in BID or TID schedules .
VIRACEPT has been evaluated in 2 studies of young infants .
The PENTA 7 study was an open - label study to evaluate the toxicity , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , and activity of NFV + d4T + ddI in 20 HIV - infected infants less than 12 weeks of age .
PACTG 353 evaluated the pharmacokinetics and safety of VIRACEPT in infants born to HIV - infected women receiving NFV as part of combination therapy during pregnancy .
Geriatric Use Clinical studies of VIRACEPT did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
ADVERSE REACTIONS The safety of VIRACEPT was studied in over 5000 patients who received drug either alone or in combination with nucleoside analogues .
The majority of adverse events were of mild intensity .
The most frequently reported adverse event among patients receiving VIRACEPT was diarrhea , which was generally of mild to moderate intensity .
Drug - related clinical adverse experiences of moderate or severe intensity in ≥ 2 % of patients treated with VIRACEPT coadministered with d4T and 3 TC ( Study 542 ) for up to 48 weeks or with ZDV plus 3 TC ( Study 511 ) for up to 24 weeks are presented in Table 12 .

The adverse event profile seen during pediatric clinical trials was similar to that for adults .
The most commonly reported drug - related , treatment - emergent adverse events reported in the pediatric studies included : diarrhea , leukopenia / neutropenia , rash , anorexia , and abdominal pain .
Diarrhea , regardless of assigned relationship to study drug , was reported in 39 % to 47 % of pediatric patients receiving VIRACEPT in 2 of the larger treatment trials .
Leukopenia / neutropenia was the laboratory abnormality most commonly reported as a significant event across the pediatric studies .
OVERDOSAGE Human experience of acute overdose with VIRACEPT is limited .
There is no specific antidote for overdose with VIRACEPT .
If indicated , elimination of unabsorbed drug should be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage .
Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid removal of unabsorbed drug .
Since nelfinavir is highly protein bound , dialysis is unlikely to significantly remove drug from blood .

What is VIRACEPT and how does it work ?
VIRACEPT is a type of medicine called an HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ) protease ( PRO - tee - ase ) inhibitor .
VIRACEPT is always used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs in the treatment of people with HIV infection .
VIRACEPT is for adults and for children 2 years of age and older .
Infection with HIV leads to the destruction of CD4 ( T ) cells , which are important to the immune system .
After a large number of CD4 ( T ) cells have been destroyed , the infected person develops acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
VIRACEPT works by blocking HIV protease ( a protein - cutting enzyme ) , which is required for HIV to multiply .
VIRACEPT has been shown to significantly reduce the amount of HIV in the blood .
Although VIRACEPT is not a cure for HIV or AIDS , VIRACEPT can help reduce your risk for death and illness associated with HIV .
Patients who took VIRACEPT also had significant increases in the number of CD4 ( T ) cells .
Does VIRACEPT cure HIV or AIDS ?
VIRACEPT is not a cure for HIV infection or AIDS .
People taking VIRACEPT may still develop opportunistic infections or other conditions associated with HIV infection .
Some of these conditions are pneumonia , herpes virus infections , Mycobacterium avium complex ( MAC ) infections , and Kaposi ' s sarcoma .
Does VIRACEPT reduce the risk of passing HIV to others ?
VIRACEPT does not reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination .
Continue to practice safe sex and do not use or share dirty needles .
How should I take VIRACEPT ?

Each dose should always be taken with a meal to help achieve higher VIRACEPT levels .
VIRACEPT Tablets are film - coated to help make the tablets easier to swallow .
• Dosing in children 2 years of age and older : The VIRACEPT dose in children depends on their weight .

What are the possible side effects of VIRACEPT ?
• This list of side effects is not complete .
If you have questions about side effects , ask your healthcare provider , nurse , or pharmacist .
You should report any new or continuing symptoms to your healthcare provider right away .
Your healthcare provider may be able to help you manage these side effects .
Most of the side effects experienced with VIRACEPT have been mild to moderate .
• Diarrhea is the most common side effect in people taking VIRACEPT , and most adult patients had at least mild diarrhea at some point during treatment .
In clinical studies , about 15 – 20 % of patients receiving VIRACEPT 750 mg ( three 250 mg tablets ) three times daily or 1250 mg ( five 250 mg tablets or two 625 mg tablets ) two times daily had four or more loose stools a day .
In most cases , VIRACEPT - associated diarrhea can be controlled using antidiarrheal medicines , such as Imodium A - D ® ( loperamide ) .
• Other side effects that occurred in 3 – 7 % of patients receiving VIRACEPT include nausea , gas , and rash .
• The side effects observed in children and adults receiving VIRACEPT are similar .
Diarrhea was also the most common side effect seen in children .
Some children experienced low white blood cells ( leukopenia / neutropenia ) , which resolved without treatment interruption in most cases .
• Diabetes and high blood sugar ( hyperglycemia ) occur in patients taking protease inhibitors such as VIRACEPT .
Some patients had diabetes before starting protease inhibitors , others did not .
Some patients needed changes in their diabetes medicine .
Others needed new diabetes medicine after starting their VIRACEPT medicine .
• Changes in body fat have been seen in some patients taking antiretroviral therapy .
These changes may include increased amount of fat in the upper back and neck ( " buffalo hump " ) , breast and around the trunk .
Loss of fat from the legs , arms and face may also happen .
The cause and long - term health effects of these conditions are not known at this time .
• Some patients with hemophilia have increased bleeding with protease inhibitors .
• There were other side effects , some of them serious , noted in clinical studies that occurred in less than 2 % of patients receiving VIRACEPT .
However , these side effects may have been due to other drugs that patients were taking or to the illness itself .
Except for diarrhea , there were not many differences in side effects in patients who took VIRACEPT along with other drugs compared with those who took only the other drugs .
• Before you start using any medicine , talk with your healthcare provider about what to expect and discuss ways to reduce the side effects you may have .
How should VIRACEPT be stored ?
• Keep VIRACEPT and all other medicines out of the reach of children .
• Keep bottle closed and store at room temperature ( between 59 ° F and 86 ° F ) away from sources of moisture such as a sink or other damp place .
