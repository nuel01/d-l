Drug Interactions ( 7 ) 06 / 2021 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE BabyBIG ® , Botulism Immune Globulin Intravenous ( Human ) , is indicated for the treatment of infant botulism caused by toxin type A or B in patients below one year of age .
BabyBIG is an immune globulin intravenous ( human ) indicated for : • Treatment of infant botulism caused by toxin types A or B in patients below one year of age ( 1 ) .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Intravenous Use Only Intravenous use only ( 2 ) • Recommended dose is 1 . 0 mL / kg ( 50 mg / kg ) given as a single intravenous infusion ( 2 ) .
• Reconstitute in 2 mL Sterile Water for Injection USP and initiate infusion within 2 hours of reconstitution ( 2 . 1 ) .
• Administer BabyBIG through a separate intravenous line ( 2 . 3 ) .
• Begin infusion slowly ( 0 . 5 mL / kg / h ) ; if no untoward reaction in 15 minutes , increase rate to 1 . 0 mL / kg / h ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 ) .
• DO NOT EXCEED THE RECOMMENDED DOSE , CONCENTRATION , AND RATE OF INFUSION ( 2 . 3 ) .
2 . 1 Preparation for Administration • BabyBIG does not contain a preservative .
After reconstitution of the lyophilized product , the vial should be entered only once for the purpose of administration , and the infusion should begin within 2 hours of reconstitution .
• Remove the tab portion of the vial cap and clean the rubber stopper with 70 % alcohol or equivalent .
• Reconstitute the lyophilized powder with 2 mL of Sterile Water for Injection USP , to obtain a 50 mg / mL BabyBIG solution .
A double - ended transfer needle or large syringe is suitable for adding the water for reconstitution .
When using a double - ended transfer needle , insert one end first into the vial of water .
The lyophilized powder is supplied in an evacuated vial ; therefore , the water should transfer by suction ( the jet of water should be aimed to the side of the vial ) .
After the water is transferred into the evacuated vial , the residual vacuum should be released to hasten the dissolution .
• Rotate the container gently to wet all the powder .
An approximately 30 - minute interval should be allowed for dissolving the powder .
DO NOT SHAKE THE VIAL , AS THIS WILL CAUSE FOAMING .
• Inspect BabyBIG visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration .
Infuse the solution only if it is colorless , free of particulate matter , and not turbid [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 ) ] .
• To prevent the transmission of hepatitis viruses or other infectious agents from one person to another , use sterile disposable syringes and needles .
Never reuse syringes and needles .
2 . 2 Treatment of Infant Botulism Caused by Toxin Type A or B The recommended total dosage of BabyBIG is 1 . 0 mL / kg ( 50 mg / kg ) , given as a single intravenous infusion as soon as the clinical diagnosis of infant botulism is made .
BabyBIG should be used with caution in patients with pre - existing renal insufficiency and in patients judged to be at increased risk of developing renal insufficiency ( including , but not limited to , those with diabetes mellitus , volume depletion , paraproteinemia , sepsis , or who are receiving known nephrotoxic drugs ) [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 3 Administration • Do not pre - dilute BabyBIG before infusion .
• Begin infusion within 2 hours after reconstitution is complete and conclude within 4 hours of reconstitution , unless infusion is temporarily interrupted for adverse reaction .
Monitor vital signs continuously during infusion .
• Administer BabyBIG intravenously using low volume tubing and a constant infusion pump ( i . e . , an IVAC pump or equivalent ) through a separate intravenous line .
If a separate line is not possible , it may be " piggybacked " into a pre - existing line if that line contains either Sodium Chloride Injection USP , or one of the following dextrose solutions ( with or without NaCl added ) : 2 . 5 % dextrose in water , 5 % dextrose in water , 10 % dextrose in water , or 20 % dextrose in water .
If a pre - existing line must be used , do not dilute BabyBIG more than 1 : 2 with any of the above - named solutions .
Admixtures of BabyBIG with any other solutions have not been evaluated .
Use an in - line or syringe - tip sterile , disposable filter ( 18 μm ) for the administration of BabyBIG .
• In the absence of prospective data allowing identification of the maximum safe dose , concentration , and rate of infusion in these patients , DO NOT EXCEED THE RECOMMENDED DOSE , CONCENTRATION , AND RATE OF INFUSION .
• Begin infusion slowly .
Administer BabyBIG intravenously at 0 . 5 mL per kg body weight per hour ( 25 mg / kg / h ) .
If no untoward reactions occur after 15 minutes , the rate may be increased to 1 . 0 mL / kg / h ( 50 mg / kg / h ) .
DO NOT EXCEED THIS RATE OF ADMINISTRATION .
Monitor the patient closely during and after each rate change [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
At the recommended rates , infusion of the indicated dose should take 67 . 5 minutes total elapsed time .
Time ( minutes ) Rate of 5 % Solution mg / kg / hr 0 - 15 0 . 5 mL / kg / h 25 15 to end of infusion 1 . 0 mL / kg / h 50 • As adverse reactions experienced by patients treated with immune globulin intravenous ( human ) ( IGIV ) products have been related to the infusion rate , if the patient develops a minor side effect ( i . e . , flushing ) , slow the rate of infusion or temporarily interrupt the infusion .
If anaphylaxis or a significant drop in blood pressure occurs , discontinue the infusion and administer epinephrine .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS • 100 mg ± 20 mg lyophilized immunoglobulin per single - dose vial • Single - use vial of 100 mg ± 20 mg lyophilized immunoglobulin ( 3 ) • Reconstitution as directed results in a BabyBIG solution concentration of 50 mg / mL ( 2 . 1 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • As with other immunoglobulin preparations , BabyBIG should not be used in individuals with a prior history of severe reaction to other human immunoglobulin preparations .
[ 1 - 4 ] • Individuals with selective immunoglobulin A deficiency have the potential for developing antibodies to immunoglobulin A and could have anaphylactic reactions to the subsequent administration of blood products that contain immunoglobulin A . • Prior history of severe reaction to other human immunoglobulin preparations ( 4 ) • Selective immunoglobulin A deficiency with anti - IgA antibodies ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Only administer BabyBIGas an intravenous infusion , since other routes of administration have not been evaluated .
Do not use BabyBIG if the reconstituted solution is turbid [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
• Assess renal function prior to and following administration ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) .
• Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity reactions may occur ( 5 . 4 ) .
This risk should be considered when an IgA - deficient patient is to receive subsequent administration of blood products containing IgA after previous treatment with BabyBIG ( 4 ) .
• Hyperproteinemia , increased serum viscosity and hyponatremia may occur in patients receiving immune globulin intravenous ( human ) ( IGIV ) therapy ( 5 . 6 ) .
• Thrombotic events have occurred in patients receiving IGIV products .
Monitor patients with known risk factors for thrombotic events ; consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity for those at risk of hyperviscosity ( 5 . 7 ) .
• Hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration ( 5 . 8 ) .
• IGIV recipients should be monitored for pulmonary adverse reactions , such as Transfusion - Related Acute Lung Injury ( TRALI ) ( 5 . 9 ) .
• Aseptic meningitis syndrome ( AMS ) has been reported with other IGIV treatment , especially with high doses or rapid infusion ( 5 . 5 ) .
• The product is made from human plasma and may contain infectious agents , e . g . viruses and , theoretically , the Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease agent ( 5 . 3 ) .
5 . 1 Patient Monitoring for Administration • Patients should be well hydrated prior to the initiation of the BabyBIG infusion .
• Assess renal function , including the measurement of blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) or serum creatinine prior to the initial infusion of BabyBIG [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 ) ] .
Periodic monitoring of renal function tests and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to have a potential risk for developing acute renal failure .
[ 1 - 6 ] Increases in serum creatinine and BUN have been observed as soon as one to two days following treatment with other IGIV products .
• During administration , monitor the patient ' s vital signs continuously and observe the patient carefully for any associated symptoms .
• DO NOT EXCEED THE RECOMMENDED INFUSION RATE of 1 mL / kg / hour ( 50 mg / kg / h ) , and follow the infusion schedule closely [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
If a patient develops an infusion reaction , slow the rate of infusion immediately or temporarily interrupt the infusion .
5 . 2 Renal Adverse Reactions Other IGIV products have been reported to be associated with renal dysfunction , acute renal failure , osmotic nephrosis , and death .
[ 5 , 6 ] While these reports of renal dysfunction and acute renal failure have been associated with the use of many licensed IGIV products , those that contained sucrose as a stabilizer and were administered at daily doses of 400 mg / kg or greater have accounted for a disproportionate share of the total number .
[ 5 , 7 ] BabyBIG contains sucrose as a stabilizer .
Patients predisposed to acute renal failure include those patients with any degree of pre - existing renal insufficiency , diabetes mellitus , volume depletion , sepsis , paraproteinemia , or who are receiving known nephrotoxic drugs .
Especially in such patients , BabyBIG should be administered at the minimum concentration available and at the minimum rate of infusion practicable .
[ 1 - 4 ] 5 . 3 Transmission of Blood - Borne Infectious Agents BabyBIG is made from human plasma and , like other plasma products , carries the possibility for transmission of blood - borne viral agents and , theoretically , the Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease agent .
The risk of transmission of recognized blood - borne viruses has been reduced by screening plasma donors for prior exposure to certain viruses , for the presence of certain viral infections , and by the viral inactivation and / or removal properties of the precipitation procedures used for the purification of BabyBIG [ see DESCRIPTION ( 11 ) ] .
Despite these measures , some as yet unrecognized blood - borne infectious agents may not be inactivated by the manufacturing process ; therefore , BabyBIG , like any other blood product , should be given only if a benefit is expected [ see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 4 Anaphylaxis • Severe reactions , such as angioedema and anaphylactic shock , although not observed during clinical trials with BabyBIG , are a possibility .
[ 8 , 9 ] Clinical anaphylaxis may occur even when the patient is not known to be sensitive to immune globulin products .
A reaction may be related to the rate of infusion ; therefore , carefully adhere to the infusion rates as outlined under " DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 3 ) . "
If anaphylaxis or a drop in blood pressure occurs , discontinue the infusion and administer epinephrine .
[ 1 - 4 ] • Although acute systemic allergic reactions were not seen in clinical trials with BabyBIG , epinephrine should be available for treatment of acute allergic symptoms [ see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
If hypotension or anaphylaxis occurs , discontinue the administration of BabyBIG immediately and give supportive care as needed .
5 . 5 Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome • An aseptic meningitis syndrome ( AMS ) has been reported to occur infrequently in association with IGIV administration .
[ 10 - 13 ] The syndrome usually begins within several hours to two days following IGIV treatment .
It is characterized by symptoms and signs that include the following : severe headache , nuchal rigidity , drowsiness , fever , photophobia , painful eye movements , and nausea and vomiting .
Cerebrospinal fluid studies are frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per cubic millimeter , predominately from the granulocytic series , and with elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg / dL .
Conduct a thorough neurological examination in patients exhibiting such symptoms and signs to rule out other causes of meningitis .
[ 10 - 13 ] AMS may occur more frequently in association with high total doses ( 2 g / kg ) of IGIV treatment .
Discontinuation of IGIV treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae .
[ 1 , 10 - 13 ] AMS was not observed in clinical trials of BabyBIG .
5 . 6 Hyperproteinemia , Hyponatremia , and Serum Viscosity Hyperproteinemia , hyponatremia , and increased serum viscosity have been observed following administration of IGIV products .
It is clinically critical to distinguish true hyponatremia from pseudohyponatremia caused by decreased calculated serum osmolality or elevated osmolar gap , because treatment aimed at decreasing serum free water in patients with pseudohyponatremia may lead to volume depletion , a further increase in serum viscosity and a higher risk of thromboembolic events .
These adverse events have not been observed with BabyBIG .
5 . 7 Thrombotic Events Thrombotic events may occur following IGIV treatment .
Patients at risk may include those with a history of atherosclerosis , multiple cardiovascular risk factors , advanced age , impaired cardiac output , coagulation disorders , prolonged periods of immobilization , and / or known or suspected hyperviscosity .
Consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity , including those with cryoglobulins , fasting chylomicronemia / markedly high triacylglycerols ( triglycerides ) , or monoclonal gammopathies .
For patients judged to be at risk of developing thrombotic events , administer BabyBIG at the minimum rate of infusion practicable .
5 . 8 Hemolytic Anemia IGIV products may contain blood group antibodies , which can act as hemolysins and induce in vivo coating of red blood cells with immunoglobulin , causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction and , rarely , hemolysis .
Hemolytic anemia may develop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced red blood cell sequestration .
Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis .
If these are present after BabyBIG infusion , perform appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing .
5 . 9 Transfusion - Related Acute Lung Injury ( TRALI ) Non - cardiogenic pulmonary edema may occur in patients following IGIV treatment .
[ 14 ] TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress , pulmonary edema , hypoxemia , normal left ventricular function , and fever .
Symptoms typically occur within 1 to 6 hours following treatment [ See PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION ( 17 ) ] .
Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions .
If TRALI is suspected , perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti - neutrophil antibodies in both the product and patient serum .
TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS • Serious adverse reactions were not observed in clinical trials using BabyBIG .
• The most common adverse reaction observed with BabyBIG treatment during clinical trials ( > 5 % ) was skin rash .
• Other reactions such as chills , muscle cramps , back pain , fever , nausea , vomiting , and wheezing were the most frequent adverse reactions observed during the clinical trials of similarly - prepared human IGIV products .
[ 15 ] The incidence of these reactions was less than 5 % of all infusions in BabyBIG clinical trials , and these reactions were most often related to infusion rates .
[ 7 ] The most common adverse reaction occurring in at least 5 % of the patients treated with BabyBIG in a controlled clinical study was mild and transient erythematous rash of the face or trunk ( 6 . 1 ) .
To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact the California Department of Public Health at 1 - 510 - 231 - 7600 and http : / / www . infantbotulism . org / or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
Two clinical studies of BabyBIG were performed : ( 1 ) an adequate and well - controlled study to evaluate safety and efficacy of BabyBIG , which used BabyBIG Lot 1 , and ( 2 ) an open label study to collect additional safety data and confirm efficacy , which used BabyBIG Lot 2 [ see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14 ) ] .
[ 16 , 17 ] Different methodologies were used to collect adverse events in the controlled study and open label study .
Minor clinical events that were not recorded as adverse events in the controlled study were recorded as adverse events in the open label study .
The only adverse event considered possibly related to BabyBIG administration was a mild , transient erythematous rash of the face or trunk .
The following table summarizes the occurrence of rash by day of study relative to day of treatment for the randomized , controlled clinical trial ( RCT ) and for the open label study ( OLS ) .

[ 2 ] Day 0 is the day of treatment .
[ 3 ] In reference to treatment .
In the controlled study , when only treatment emergent events are considered , 14 % of the BabyBIG - treated patients experienced erythematous rash during or after study infusion .
Eight percent of placebo - treated patients also experienced erythematous rash in this study .
A similar rash is known to occur both in infant botulism patients who have not received any IGIV products [ 18 ] and in patients treated with other IGIVs , [ 2 , 3 ] making it difficult to ascertain the causality of the rash .
In the controlled study only , the following adverse events occurred in at least 5 % of the patients receiving BabyBIG or placebo : Adverse Event BabyBIG N = 65 Placebo [ 1 ] N = 64 n ( % ) N ( % ) of Patients with any AE 20 ( 31 ) 29 ( 45 ) Rash erythematous 9 ( 14 ) 5 ( 8 ) Otitis media 7 ( 11 ) 5 ( 8 ) Pneumonia 7 ( 11 ) 9 ( 14 ) Anemia 3 ( 5 ) 9 ( 14 ) Hyponatremia 3 ( 5 ) 9 ( 14 ) Hypertension 1 ( 2 ) 3 ( 5 ) Respiratory arrest 1 ( 2 ) 6 ( 9 ) Urinary tract infection 1 ( 2 ) 8 ( 13 ) Convulsions 0 3 ( 5 ) [ 1 ] Both Gammagard 5 % and Gammagard S / D 5 % were used as placebo in this study .

For example , " increased blood pressure " or " decreased blood pressure " was assigned when transient changes in blood pressure were observed , whereas " hypertension " or " hypotension " was assigned when more prolonged or significant changes were observed .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Because postmarketing reporting of adverse reactions is voluntary and from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency of these reactions or establish a causal relationship to product exposure .
Experience with BabyBIG .
No adverse reactions have been identified or reported that are ascribed to the use of BabyBIGduring postapproval use .
Retrospective publications have shown safety - related information consistent with the safety - related information in the approved product labeling , and no new safety - related information has been presented for BabyBIG .
[ 19 , 20 ] Experience with Other IGIV Products .
Some classes of adverse reactions that have not been reported in BabyBIG clinical studies or postmarketing experience have been observed with the overall post - approval use of other IGIV products , as shown in the following table .
Respiratory Apnea , Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) , Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury ( TRALI ) , cyanosis , hypoxemia , pulmonary edema , dyspnea , bronchospasm Cardiovascular Cardiac arrest , thromboembolism , vascular collapse , hypotension Neurological Coma , loss of consciousness , seizures , tremor Integumentary Steven - Johnson syndrome , epidermolysis , erythema multiforme , bullous dermatitis Hematologic Pancytopenia , leukopenia , hemolysis , positive direct antiglobulin ( Coombs ' ) test General / Body as a Whole Pyrexia , rigors Musculoskeletal Back pain Gastrointestinal Hepatic dysfunction , abdominal pain 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Admixtures of BabyBIG with other drugs have not been evaluated .
It is recommended that BabyBIG be administered separately from other drugs or medications that the patient may be receiving [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 ) ] .
• Antibodies present in immune globulin preparations may interfere with the immune response to live virus vaccines such as polio , measles , mumps , and rubella ; therefore , vaccination with live virus vaccines such as MMR ( measles , mumps , and rubella ) , MMRV ( measles , mumps , rubella , and varicella ) , and monovalent varicella vaccines should be deferred until six months after administration of BabyBIG .
This interval may be shortened if exposure to measles is likely .
If such vaccinations were given shortly before or after BabyBIG administration , revaccination may be necessary .
[ 21 ] • The passive transfer of antibodies may interfere with the response to live viral vaccines ( 7 ) .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • For use only in patients below one year of age ( 8 . 4 ) • Renal impairment : Administer at minimum concentration and rate of infusion ( 2 . 3 ) 8 . 4 Pediatric Use BabyBIG has been studied for safety and efficacy only in patients below one year of age [ see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 ) and CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14 ) ] .
It has not been tested in other populations .
10 OVERDOSAGE Although limited data are available , clinical experience with other immunoglobulin preparations suggests that the major manifestations would be those related to volume overload .
[ 1 ] 11 DESCRIPTION BabyBIG , Botulism Immune Globulin Intravenous ( Human ) ( BIG - IV ) , is a solvent - detergent - treated , sterile , lyophilized powder of immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) , stabilized with 5 % sucrose and 1 % albumin ( human ) .
It contains no preservative .
The purified immunoglobulin is derived from pooled adult plasma from persons who were immunized with recombinant botulinum vaccine for serotypes A and B ( rBV A / B ) and selected for their high titers of neutralizing antibody against botulinum neurotoxins type A and B . All donors were tested and their sera found to be negative for antibodies against the human immunodeficiency virus and the hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses .
The pooled plasma was fractionated by cold ethanol precipitation of the proteins according to the Cohn / Oncley method , modified to yield a product suitable for intravenous administration .
[ 22 , 23 ] Several steps in the manufacturing process have been validated for their ability to inactivate or remove viruses that may not have been detected in the Source Plasma .
[ 1 , 24 - 27 ] These include Cohn / Oncley fractionation ( Fraction I through Supernatant III Filtrate ) ; nanofiltration through one 75 - nm and two 35 - nm filters ; and solvent / detergent viral inactivation .
These viral reduction steps have been validated in a series of in vitro experiments for their capacity to inactivate and / or remove Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) and the following model viruses : bovine viral diarrhea virus ( BVDV ) as a model for hepatitis C virus ; mouse encephalomyelitis virus ( MEMV ) as a model for hepatitis A virus ; and pseudorabies virus ( PRV ) , feline calicivirus ( FCV ) , and Sindbis virus to cover a wide range of physicochemical properties in the model viruses studied .
Total mean log10 reductions range from 4 . 63 to greater than 16 log10 as shown in the following table .
Process Step Mean Reduction Factor ( log10 ) Enveloped Viruses ( size in nm ) Non - Enveloped Viruses ( size in nm ) Sindbis ( 60 - 70 ) HIV - 1 ( 80 - 100 ) PRV ( 120 - 200 ) BVDV ( 40 - 60 ) MEMV ( 22 - 30 ) FCV ( 35 - 39 ) Cohn / Oncley fractionation 6 . 6 > 9 . 44 > 10 . 37 6 . 25 4 . 06 Not done Nanofiltration ≥ 6 . 84 Not done Not done ≥ 5 . 4 Not done ≥ 6 . 92 Solvent / detergent treatment Not done > 4 . 51 > 5 . 53 > 4 . 85 0 . 57 [ 1 ] Not done Cumulative Reduction Factor ( log10 ) ≥ 13 . 44 > 13 . 95 > 15 . 9 ≥ 16 . 5 4 . 63 ≥ 6 . 92 [ 1 ] Included hydrophobic chromatography after solvent / detergent treatment .
Additional testing performed with bovine parvovirus ( as a model for parvovirus B19 ) showed a mean cumulative reduction factor of greater than 7 . 34 log10 for Cohn / Oncley fractionation and solvent / detergent treatment followed by hydrophobic chromatography .
A mean cumulative reduction factor of 2 . 55 log10 was observed for removal of porcine parvovirus by nanofiltration .
When reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection USP , each cubic centimeter ( milliliter ) contains approximately 50 ± 10 mg immunoglobulin , primarily IgG , and trace amounts of IgA and IgM ; 50 mg sucrose ; 10 mg albumin ( human ) ; and approximately 20 × 10 - 3 mEq sodium .
The reconstituted solution should appear colorless and translucent [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 1 ) , WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 ) ] .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY BabyBIG contains IgG antibodies from the immunized donors who contributed to the plasma pool from which the product was derived .
The titer of antibodies in the reconstituted product against type A botulinum toxin is at least 15 IU / mL and against type B toxin is at least 4 . 0 IU / mL .
For toxin types A and B , by definition , 1 IU of botulinum antitoxin neutralizes 10 , 000 intraperitoneal mouse LD50 of botulinum toxin .
The titers of antibody against botulinum neurotoxins C , D , and E have not been determined .
In the case of infants who may be exposed to botulinum neurotoxin type A or B , this product is expected to provide the relevant antibodies at levels sufficient to neutralize the expected levels of circulating neurotoxin .
[ 16 , 28 ] 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action BabyBIG contains antibodies specific for botulinum neurotoxin types A and B that bind to and neutralize circulating toxin types A and B in the patient .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Formal studies on pharmacodynamics have not been conducted with BabyBIG .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Traditional pharmacokinetic studies of BabyBIG have not been performed .
However , the following table summarizes the mean serum titer of the anti - A component of BabyBIG following administration .

[ 2 , 16 ] 14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two clinical studies in infant botulism were performed : [ 16 ] ( 1 ) an adequate and well - controlled study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BabyBIG ( N = 129 ) , and ( 2 ) an open label study to collect additional safety data and confirm efficacy ( N = 293 ) .
In the adequate and well - controlled clinical study , BabyBIG , given within the first 3 days of hospital admission to 59 patients with laboratory - confirmed infant botulism , has been shown to reduce the following : Average Length in Weeks p - value Placebo [ 1 ] N = 63 BabyBIG N = 59 Hospital stay 5 . 7 2 . 6 p < 0 . 0001 Intensive Care Unit stay 3 . 6 1 . 3 p < 0 . 01 Mechanical ventilation 2 . 4 0 . 7 p < 0 . 05 Tube - feeding 10 . 0 3 . 6 p < 0 . 01 [ 1 ] Both Gammagard 5 % and Gammagard S / D 5 % were used as placebo in this study .
Length of hospital stay was also analyzed by patient age in both the adequate and well - controlled study and in an open label study .
