8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : Based on animal data may cause fetal harm .
( 8 . 1 ) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no data on Triferic use in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage .
In pregnant rats and rabbits , ferric pyrophosphate citrate caused adverse developmental outcomes at maternally toxic dose levels that were higher than the maximum theoretical amount of iron transferred to patients from Triferic .
Use Triferic during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the US .
general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % respectively .
Data Animal Data In a fertility and early embryonic development study in female rats , the maternally toxic ferric pyrophosphate citrate dose of 40 mg / kg administered three times per week by intravenous ( IV ) infusion was not toxic to the developing embryo .
In embryo - fetal developmental toxicity studies , ferric pyrophosphate citrate was administered during the period of organogenesis as a one - hour IV infusion to pregnant rats and rabbits .
No maternal or developmental toxicity was observed at doses up to 30 mg / kg / day in rats and 20 mg / kg / day in rabbits .
Maternally toxic doses affected embryo - fetal development , resulting in post - implantation loss due to early resorptions , abnormal placentae , decreased fetal body weight and fetal head and vertebral malformations at 90 mg / kg / day in rats and vertebral malformations at 40 mg / kg / day in rabbits .
A pre - and post - natal development study was conducted in pregnant rats with intravenous doses of ferric pyrophosphate citrate up to 90 mg / kg / day .

11 DESCRIPTION Triferic ( ferric pyrophosphate citrate ) is a mixed - ligand iron complex in which iron ( III ) is bound to pyrophosphate and citrate .
It has a molecular formula of Fe 4 ( C 6 H 4 O 7 ) 3 ( H 2 P 2 O 7 ) 2 ( P 2 O 7 ) and a relative molecular weight of approximately 1313 daltons .
Triferic contains iron ( 7 . 5 - 9 . 0 % w / w ) , citrate ( 15 - 22 % w / w ) , pyrophosphate ( 15 - 22 % w / w ) , phosphate ( < 2 % w / w ) , sodium ( 18 - 25 % w / w ) and sulfate ( 20 - 35 % ) .
Ferric pyrophosphate citrate has the following molecular structure : Triferic solution : Triferic ( ferric pyrophosphate citrate ) solution – is a clear , slightly yellow - green color sterile solution containing 27 . 2 mg of elemental iron ( III ) per 5 mL ( 5 . 44 mg iron ( III ) per mL ) filled in a 5 mL low density polyethylene ( LDPE ) ampule .
Each Triferic ampule contains iron ( 7 . 5 - 9 . 0 % w / w ) , citrate ( 15 - 22 % w / w ) , pyrophosphate ( 15 - 22 % w / w ) , phosphate ( < 2 % w / w ) , sodium ( 18 ‑ 25 % w / w ) and sulfate ( 20 - 35 % ) .
One Triferic 5 mL ampule is added to 2 . 5 gallons ( 9 . 46 L ) of bicarbonate concentrate .
Triferic powder Packets : Triferic ( ferric pyrophosphate citrate ) powder is a slightly yellow - green powder , packaged in single use paper , polyethylene and aluminum foil packets , each containing 272 . 0 mg of elemental iron ( III ) .
Each Triferic packet contains iron ( 7 . 5 - 9 . 0 % w / w ) , citrate ( 15 - 22 % w / w ) , pyrophosphate ( 15 - 22 % w / w ) , phosphate ( < 2 % w / w ) , sodium ( 18 ‑ 25 % w / w ) and sulfate ( 20 - 35 % ) .
One Triferic powder packet is added to 25 ( 94 . 6 L ) gallons of master bicarbonate mix .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Triferic contains iron in the form of ferric pyrophosphate citrate and is added to hemodialysate solution to be administered to patients by transfer across the dialyzer membrane .
Iron delivered into the circulation binds to transferrin for transport to erythroid precursor cells to be incorporated into hemoglobin .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of serum iron was investigated in healthy volunteers administered 2 . 5 , 5 , 7 . 5 and 10 mg Triferic intravenously over 4 hours , or 15 mg and 20 mg Triferic intravenously over 12 hours .
After correcting for the basal iron levels , the AUC and C max of baseline - corrected serum iron increased in a dose - proportional manner .
The half - life of serum iron was approximately 1 . 48 hours , the mean clearance ( CL ) ranged from 0 . 406 to 0 . 556 L / hour , the mean apparent volume of distribution ( Vz ) ranged from 0 . 765 to 0 . 859 L after a 4 - hour intravenous administration of Triferic .
Compared to the 4 - hour infusion of Triferic , higher mean CL and Vz were observed following the administration of Triferic 15 mg ( CL = 0 . 672 L / hour and Vz = 1 . 66 L ) and Triferic 20 mg ( CL = 0 . 661 L / hour , Vz = 2 . 08 L ) infused over 12 hours .
In a study that assessed the impact of different dialysis conditions on iron delivery in patients administered Triferic via hemodialysis , a reduction of the blood and dialysate flow rates ( Qb / Qd of 200 / 400 mL / min vs . ≥ 350 / ≥ 600 mL / min ) resulted in a 33 % decrease in the median cumulative iron delivered .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Studies examining the carcinogenic potential of ferric pyrophosphate citrate have not been conducted .
Ferric pyrophosphate citrate was clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in CHO cells in the presence of metabolic activation .
Ferric pyrophosphate citrate was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) test or clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in CHO cells in the absence of metabolic activation or in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
In a combined male and female fertility study in rats , ferric pyrophosphate citrate was administered intravenously over one hour three times per week at doses of up to 40 mg / kg .
No adverse effects on fertility or reproduction were noted .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of Triferic in patients with HDD - CKD was assessed in two randomized , single blind , placebo - controlled clinical trials .
Patients with hemoglobin of 9 g / dL to 12 g / dL with TSAT > 20 % and serum ferritin concentrations > 200 mcg / L were enrolled .
Patients were to remain in randomized treatment until pre - specified hemoglobin or ferritin criteria were met , indicating the need for a change in anemia management , or if they completed 48 weeks .
Triferic was added to the bicarbonate concentrate with a final concentration of 110 mcg iron / L in the dialysate and was administered 3 or 4 times per week during hemodialysis .
Most patients were receiving a stable dose of erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) at baseline .
After randomization , patients ' ESA doses were not to be changed .
In Study 1 , the mean age of patients was 58 years ( range 23 to 89 ) ; 32 % were female , 55 % were Caucasian , 32 % were African American , and 13 % were other races .
In Study 2 , the mean age of patients was 58 years ( range 20 to 89 ) ; 41 % were female , 54 % were Caucasian , 40 % were African American , and 6 % were other races .
The primary endpoint of the studies was the mean change in hemoglobin from baseline to the end - of - treatment period ( average hemoglobin of the last one - sixth ( 1 / 6 th ) of the time in the randomized treatment period ) .
About 18 % of patients completed the planned 48 - week treatment duration .
Table 2 shows the mean changes in hemoglobin ( Hgb ) and iron parameters in each treatment group from baseline to the end - of - treatment period for the ITT population .
