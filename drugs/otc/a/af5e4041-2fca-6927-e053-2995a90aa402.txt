6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety of ferric pyrophosphate citrate injection , for intravenous use , has been established based on adequate and well - controlled studies of ferric pyrophosphate citrate solution for hemodialysis [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Below is a display of the adverse reactions of ferric pyrophosphate citrate solution for hemodialysis in these adequate and well - controlled studies .
The safety of ferric pyrophosphate citrate solution for hemodialysis was evaluated in 292 patients in two randomized , placebo - controlled clinical trials ( CRUISE 1 ( NCT01320202 ) and CRUISE 2 ( NCT01322347 ) ) who were administered ferric pyrophosphate citrate solution for hemodialysis usefor periods of up to 1 year [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The mean total exposure in the randomized treatment period was 5 months .
A total of 296 patients received placebo treatment for a similar time period .
In the two studies , 64 % were male and 54 % were Caucasian .
The median age of patients was 60 years ( range , 20 to 89 years ) .
Adverse reactions occurring in 3 % or greater of patients treated with ferric pyrophosphate citrate solution for hemodialysis use in the randomized clinical trials are listed in Table 1 .

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Triferic AVNU usein pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , intravenous administration of ferric pyrophosphate citrate to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes at maternally toxic dose levels that were higher than the maximum theoretical amount of iron transferred to patients from Triferic AVNU ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In a fertility and early embryonic development study in female rats , the maternally toxic ferric pyrophosphate citrate dose of 40 mg / kg administered three times per week by intravenous infusion was not toxic to the developing embryo .
In embryo - fetal developmental toxicity studies , ferric pyrophosphate citrate was administered during the period of organogenesis as a one - hour intravenous infusion to pregnant rats and rabbits .
No maternal or developmental toxicity was observed at doses up to 30 mg / kg / day in rats and 20 mg / kg / day in rabbits .
Maternally toxic doses affected embryo - fetal development , resulting in post - implantation loss due to early resorptions , abnormal placentae , decreased fetal body weight and fetal head and vertebral malformations at 90 mg / kg / day in rats and vertebral malformations at 40 mg / kg / day in rabbits .
A pre - and post - natal development study was conducted in pregnant rats with intravenous doses of ferric pyrophosphate citrate up to 90 mg / kg / day .
The maternally toxic dose of 90 mg / kg / day resulted in reductions in the number of live offspring and lower offspring body weights .
There were no adverse effects on survival of offspring at doses up to 30 mg / kg / day , or on behavior , sexual maturation or reproductive parameters of offspring at any dose level .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ferric pyrophosphate citrate in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effect on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for Triferic AVNU and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Triferic AVNU or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients 8 . 5 Geriatric Use In controlled clinical trials , 99 ( 29 % ) patients ≥ 65 years of age were treated with ferric pyrophosphate citrate .
No overall differences in safety and efficacy were observed between older and younger patients in these trials [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .

CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of Triferic AVNU has been established based on adequate and well - controlled adult studies of ferric pyrophosphate citrate in iron replacement in patients with hemodialysis - dependent chronic kidney disease ( HDD - CKD ) .
Below is a display of the results of the adequate and well - controlled studies of ferric pyrophosphate citrate in this condition .
The efficacy of ferric pyrophosphate citrate in patients with HDD - CKD was assessed in two randomized , single blind , placebo - controlled clinical trials .
Patients with hemoglobin of 9 g / dL to 12 g / dL with TSAT > 20 % and serum ferritin concentrations > 200 mcg / L were enrolled .
Patients were to remain in randomized treatment until pre - specified hemoglobin or ferritin criteria were met , indicating the need for a change in anemia management or if they completed 48 weeks .
Ferric pyrophosphate citrate was added to bicarbonate concentrate with a final concentration of 110 mcg iron / L in the dialysate and was administered 3 or 4 times per week during hemodialysis .
Most patients were receiving stable dose of erythropoiesis stimulating agents ( ESAs ) at baseline .
After randomization , patients ESA doses were not to be changed .
In CRUISE 1 ( NCT01320202 ) , the mean age of patients was 58 years ( range 23 to 89 ) ; 68 % were male , 55 % were Caucasian , 32 % were African American , and 13 % were other races .
In CRUISE 2 ( NCT01322347 ) , the mean age of patients was 58 years ( range 20 to 89 ) ; 59 % were male , 54 % were Caucasian , 40 % were African American , and 6 % were other races .
Efficacy was assessed by the mean change in hemoglobin from baseline to the end - of - treatment period ( average hemoglobin of the last one - sixth ( 1 / 6 th ) of the time in the randomized treatment period ) .
About 18 % of patientscompleted the planned 48 week treatment duration .
Table 3 shows the mean changes in hemoglobin ( Hgb ) and iron parameters in each treatment group from baseline to the end - of - treatment period for the ITT population .
