easy interproximal therapy INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE Purpose and Indications • Phocal disks are topical delivery vehicles designed to fluoridate interproximal tooth surfaces .
This action aids in the prevention of dental caries on intact surfaces , arrests progress on surfaces with incipient carious lesions and enhances remineralization .
Phocal disks are also effective at tooth restoration margins and furcations .
• Phocal disks are to be applied only by dental professionals at selected sites to achieve the desired benefits .
Description • The patented Phocal topical fluoride disks are provided in two forms : • - pink acidulated phosphate fluoride Apf disks • - yellow non - acidic sodium fluoride pHn disks • These thin , round disks contain 1 . 23 % fluoride ions .
Once positioned interproximally they rapidly expand , soften into a gel and release fluoride for approximately 10 minutes before biodegrading .
This release period can be increased as explained in the Directions for Use .
• Each Phocal Apf disk contains 0 . 103 mg of sodium fluoride and 0 . 009 mg of hydrogen fluoride in a matrix of FD & C red 3 , gum arabic , gelatin ( of marine origin ) , propolis wax , phosphoric acid , sodium benzoate and water .
These disks induce an optimized low pH environment that cleans and etches tooth surfaces and facilitates fluoride penetration and stimulates remineralization .
• Each Phocal pHn disk contains 0 . 122 mg of sodium fluoride in a matrix of gum arabic , gelatin ( of marine origin ) , propolis wax , sodium benzoate and water .
These disks are less acidic than the Phocal Apf disks and will not etch ceramic crowns or tooth - colored restorations while inducing fluoridation and remineralization .
Directions for Use • There are different methods for the placement of Phocal fluoride disks .
• The choice of placement method and Phocal type is subject to the discretion of the dental professional and is usually dependent upon the nature of the site being treated , interproximal tightness and the strength and type of adjacent restorations and teeth .
• Prior to treatment using either of the placement methods below , all debris and calculus should be removed from the selected site ( s ) and the site ( s ) should remain dry during placement .
Premature wetting softens the disks and can compromise correct interproximal placement .
Method 1 – Insertion of flat Phocal disks Recommended for anterior teeth and where spacing allows .
• - When spacing allows , insert the flat Phocal disk interproximally with forceps and / or by hand directly between the contact points of the two adjacent teeth .
• - In some cases , separation with wedges may be necessary prior to insertion .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Method 2 – Insertion of folded Phocal disks Recommended for posterior teeth and where spacing is restrictive .
• - Where spacing is restricted , or where the apical regions such as tooth restoration margins must be reached , the disk can be folded into a V shape and easily inserted below the contact point .
• - To fold the Phocal disk , lightly dampen the tips of a pair of thin forceps and shake off excess water , while keeping your hands completely dry .
Use the tip of the thin forceps to moisten only the midline of the disk by moving the forceps tip back and forth along the midline .
Be sure that midline is damp enough so the disk can fold without snapping .
• - Then hold the disk at the midline with the thin forceps and gently fold the disk into a V shape with dry fingers .
If you feel that the disk could snap , stop folding and repeat the midline moistening step .
• - Insert the folded Phocal disk by hand and / or with forceps interproximally , with the apex at or below the contact area but over the gingival papillae and with each folded flap in contact with the wall of the adjacent teeth .
• - The folded Phocal disk apex can be pushed further into the contact area .
To accomplish this , insert a thin probe under the fold of the disk to apply coronal pressure alone , or simultaneously with an apical wedge force from the interproximal occlusal surface .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] • In rare cases nickel titanium springs , elastic O - rings or Maxian strips can be used to separate teeth but this is usually a slower process which requires two visits : one for separation and then one for disk placement .
• To accelerate the initial reactions of Phocal disks a curing light can be applied for 3 - 10 seconds .
• To extend the fluoride release time period , a varnish can be applied to partially cover the interproximal site or disk occlusally , buccally or / and lingually .
However the disk should not be completely coated with varnish .
• To shorten the release time the disks can be removed using an appropriate instrument , dental floss and / or aspiration .
• If Phocal Apf is used , in order to guard against possible etching of porcelain crowns or tooth - colored restorations , a protective matrix should be used .
With Phocal pHn there is no risk of etching .
• Advise the patient not to eat , drink or rinse for at least 30 minutes after treatment .
• If multiple applications are necessary , treat no more than 8 sites at a time and delay subsequent Phocal applications for at least a day .
• If deemed necessary , patients may be recalled at intervals of 2 to 12 months for repeated treatments .
• Phocal disks are versatile , and with specific gentle moisturization they can be trimmed , rolled , or folded to fit other inaccessible areas such as furcations .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Warnings • In rare cases , sensitivity or adverse reactions may be experienced .
In such cases immediately remove the disks while preventing swallowing and refer the patient to a physician .
• Patients less than 12 years old and patients with special needs should remain under professional supervision until the Phocal disks have biodegraded or have been removed .
• The disks are not intended for systemic ingestion and should be kept out of children ' s reach .
If more than 20 disks are accidently swallowed , seek immediate medical assistance .
• Phocal should not be applied in sites with : gingival inflammation , immediately prior to or after oral soft tissue surgery and in cases of known allergies to any of the Phocal ingredients .
• Phocal is to be sold as unbroken boxes with all disks sealed within the blister packs and is to be used for application in the dental office by professionals only .
• When Phocal treatment is utilized , routine systemic and topical administrations of fluoride should be suspended during the day of application .
• Since the propolis wax and gelatin used in Phocal disks are natural products , they may occasionally interact to produce brownish spots or discoloration .
This does not indicate that there is any hazard or danger in using the product .
• Recommended storage temperatures are 40 ° F - 75 ° F ( 5 ° C - 25 ° C ) .
