This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • The use of SOLODYN during tooth development ( last half of pregnancy , infancy , and childhood up to the age of 8 years ) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth ( yellow - gray - brown ) .
( 5 . 1 ) • • If pseudomembranous colitis occurs , discontinue SOLODYN .
( 5 . 2 ) • • If liver injury is suspected , discontinue SOLODYN .
( 5 . 3 ) • • If renal impairment exists , SOLODYN doses may need to be adjusted to avoid excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity .
( 5 . 4 ) • • Minocycline may cause central nervous system side effects including light - headedness , dizziness , or vertigo .
Advise patients .
( 5 . 5 ) • • Minocycline may cause pseudotumor cerebri ( benign intracranial hypertension ) in adults and adolescents .
Discontinue SOLODYN if symptoms occur .
( 5 . 6 ) • • Minocycline has been associated with autoimmune syndromes ; discontinue SOLODYN immediately if symptoms occur .
( 5 . 7 ) • • Minocycline has been associated with anaphylaxis , serious skin reactions , erythema multiforme , and DRESS syndrome .
Discontinue SOLODYN immediately if symptoms occur .
( 5 . 9 ) 5 . 1 Teratogenic Effects • 1 .
MINOCYCLINE , LIKE OTHER TETRACYCLINE - CLASS DRUGS , CAN CAUSE FETAL HARM WHEN ADMINISTERED TO A PREGNANT WOMAN .
IF ANY TETRACYCLINE IS USED DURING PREGNANCY OR IF THE PATIENT BECOMES PREGNANT WHILE TAKING THESE DRUGS , THE PATIENT SHOULD BE APPRISED OF THE POTENTIAL HAZARD TO THE FETUS .
SOLODYN should not be used during pregnancy or by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
• 2 .
THE USE OF DRUGS OF THE TETRACYCLINE CLASS DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT i . e . , ( LAST HALF OF PREGNANCY , INFANCY , AND CHILDHOOD UP TO THE AGE OF 8 YEARS ) MAY CAUSE PERMANENT DISCOLORATION OF THE TEETH i . e . , ( YELLOW - GRAY - BROWN ) .
This adverse reaction is more common during long - term use of the drug but has been observed following repeated short - term courses .
Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported .
TETRACYCLINE DRUGS , THEREFORE , SHOULD NOT BE USED DURING TOOTH DEVELOPMENT .
• 3 .
All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone - forming tissue .
A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature human infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg / kg every 6 hours .
This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued .
Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta , are found in fetal tissues , and can cause retardation of skeletal development on the developing fetus .
Evidence of embryotoxicity has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 2 Pseudomembranous Colitis Clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents , including minocycline , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin - producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over 2 months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibiotic treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
5 . 3 Hepatotoxicity Postmarketing cases of serious liver injury , including irreversible drug - induced hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure ( sometimes fatal ) , have been reported with minocycline use in the treatment of acne .
5 . 4 Metabolic Effects The anti - anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) .
While this is not a problem in those with normal renal function , in patients with significantly impaired function , higher serum levels of tetracycline - class drugs may lead to azotemia , hyperphosphatemia , and acidosis .
If renal impairment exists , even usual oral or parenteral doses may lead to excessive systemic accumulations of the drug and possible liver toxicity .
Under such conditions , lower than usual total doses are indicated , and if therapy is prolonged , serum level determinations of the drug may be advisable .
5 . 5 Central Nervous System Effects Central nervous system side effects including light - headedness , dizziness , or vertigo have been reported with minocycline therapy .
Patients who experience these symptoms should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while on minocycline therapy .
These symptoms may disappear during therapy and usually rapidly disappear when the drug is discontinued .
5 . 6 Benign Intracranial Hypertension Pseudotumor cerebri ( benign intracranial hypertension ) in adults and adolescents has been associated with the use of tetracyclines .
Minocycline has been reported to cause or precipitate pseudotumor cerebri , the hallmark of which is papilledema .
Clinical manifestations include headache and blurred vision .
Bulging fontanels have been associated with the use of tetracyclines in infants .
Although signs and symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri resolve after discontinuation of treatment , the possibility for permanent sequelae , such as visual loss that may be permanent or severe , exists .
Patients should be questioned for visual disturbances prior to initiation of treatment with tetracyclines .
If visual disturbance occurs during treatment , patients should be checked for papilledema .
Concomitant use of isotretinoin and minocycline should be avoided because isotretinoin , a systemic retinoid , is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri .
5 . 7 Autoimmune Syndromes Tetracyclines have been associated with the development of autoimmune syndromes .
The long - term use of minocycline in the treatment of acne has been associated with drug - induced lupus - like syndrome , autoimmune hepatitis , and vasculitis .
Sporadic cases of serum sickness have presented shortly after minocycline use .
Symptoms may be manifested by fever , rash , arthralgia , and malaise .
In symptomatic patients , liver function tests , ANA , CBC , and other appropriate tests should be performed to evaluate the patients .
Use of all tetracycline - class drugs should be discontinued immediately .
5 . 8 Photosensitivity Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines .
This has been reported rarely with minocycline .
Patients should minimize or avoid exposure to natural or artificial sunlight ( e . g . , tanning beds or UVA / B treatment ) while using minocycline .
If patients need to be outdoors while using minocycline , they should wear loose - fitting clothes that protect skin from sun exposure and discuss other sun protection measures with their physician .
5 . 9 Serious Skin / Hypersensitivity Reaction Cases of anaphylaxis , serious skin reactions ( e . g . , Stevens - Johnson syndrome ) , erythema multiforme , and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) syndrome have been reported postmarketing with minocycline use in patients with acne .
DRESS syndrome consists of cutaneous reaction ( such as rash or exfoliative dermatitis ) , eosinophilia , and one or more of the following visceral complications : hepatitis , pneumonitis , nephritis , myocarditis , and pericarditis .
Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present .
In some cases , death has been reported .
If this syndrome is recognized , the drug should be discontinued immediately .
5 . 10 Tissue Hyperpigmentation Tetracycline - class antibiotics are known to cause hyperpigmentation .
Tetracycline therapy may induce hyperpigmentation in many organs , including nails , bone , skin , eyes , thyroid , visceral tissue , oral cavity ( e . g . , teeth , mucosa , alveolar bone ) , sclerae , and heart valves .
Skin and oral pigmentation has been reported to occur independently of time or amount of drug administration , whereas other tissue pigmentation has been reported to occur upon prolonged administration .
Skin pigmentation includes diffuse pigmentation as well as over sites of scars or injury .
5 . 11 Development of Drug - Resistant Bacteria Bacterial resistance to tetracyclines may develop in patients using SOLODYN , therefore , the susceptibility of bacteria associated with infection should be considered in selecting antimicrobial therapy .
Because of the potential for drug - resistant bacteria to develop during the use of SOLODYN , it should be used only as indicated .
5 . 12 Superinfection As with other antibiotic preparations , use of SOLODYN may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms , including fungi .
If superinfection occurs , SOLODYN should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted .
5 . 13 Laboratory Monitoring Periodic laboratory evaluations of organ systems , including hematopoietic , renal , and hepatic studies should be performed .
Appropriate tests for autoimmune syndromes should be performed as indicated .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly observed adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 5 % ) are headache , fatigue , dizziness , and pruritus .

• Autoimmune conditions : polyarthralgia , pericarditis , exacerbation of systemic lupus , pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia , transient lupus - like syndrome .
• Central nervous system : pseudotumor cerebri , bulging fontanels in infants , decreased hearing .
• Endocrine : brown - black microscopic thyroid discoloration , abnormal thyroid function .
• Oncology : thyroid cancer .
• Oral : glossitis , dysphagia , tooth discoloration .
• Gastrointestinal : enterocolitis , pancreatitis , hepatitis , liver failure .
• Renal : reversible acute renal failure .
• Hematology : hemolytic anemia , thrombocytopenia , eosinophilia .
Preliminary studies suggest that use of minocycline may have deleterious effects on human spermatogenesis [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • • Patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage .
( 7 . 1 ) • • The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity .
( 7 . 3 ) • • To avoid contraceptive failure , female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline .
( 7 . 5 ) 7 . 1 Anticoagulants Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity , patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage .
7 . 2 Penicillin Since bacteriostatic drugs may interfere with the bactericidal action of penicillin , it is advisable to avoid giving tetracycline - class drugs in conjunction with penicillin .
7 . 3 Methoxyflurane The concurrent use of tetracycline and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity .
7 . 4 Antacids and Iron Preparations Absorption of tetracyclines is impaired by antacids containing aluminum , calcium , or magnesium and iron - containing preparations .
7 . 5 Low - Dose Oral Contraceptives In a multicenter study to evaluate the effect of SOLODYN on low - dose oral contraceptives , hormone levels over one menstrual cycle with and without SOLODYN 1 mg / kg once daily were measured .
Based on the results of this trial , minocycline - related changes in estradiol , progestinic hormone , FSH and LH plasma levels , of breakthrough bleeding , or of contraceptive failure , cannot be ruled out .
To avoid contraceptive failure , female patients are advised to use a second form of contraceptive during treatment with minocycline .
7 . 6 Drug / Laboratory Test Interactions False elevations of urinary catecholamine levels may occur due to interference with the fluorescence test .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Minocycline like other tetracycline - class drugs can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
( 5 . 1 , 8 . 1 ) • • The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development may cause permanent discoloration of teeth .
( 5 . 1 , 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category D [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] SOLODYN should not be used during pregnancy .
If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and stop treatment immediately .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies on the use of minocycline in pregnant women .
Minocycline , like other tetracycline - class drugs , crosses the placenta and may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Rare spontaneous reports of congenital anomalies including limb reduction have been reported with minocycline use in pregnancy in postmarketing experience .
Only limited information is available regarding these reports ; therefore , no conclusion on causal association can be established .
Minocycline - induced skeletal malformations ( i . e . , bent limb bones ) in fetuses when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits in doses of 30 mg / kg / day and 100 mg / kg / day , respectively , resulting in approximately 3 times and 2 times , respectively , the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of SOLODYN .
Reduced mean fetal body weight was observed in studies in which minocycline was administered to pregnant rats at a dose of 10 mg / kg / day , which resulted in approximately the same level of systemic exposure to minocycline as that observed in patients who use SOLODYN .
Minocycline was assessed for effects on peri - and postnatal development of rats in a study that involved oral administration to pregnant rats from Day 6 of gestation through the period of lactation ( postpartum Day 20 ) at dosages of 5 , 10 , or 50 mg / kg / day .
In this study , body weight gain was significantly reduced in pregnant females that received 50 mg / kg / day , resulting in approximately 2 . 5 times the systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of SOLODYN .
No effects of treatment on the duration of the gestation period or the number of live pups born per litter were observed .
Gross external anomalies observed in F1 pups ( offspring of animals that received minocycline ) included reduced body size , improperly rotated forelimbs , and reduced size of extremities .
No effects were observed on the physical development , behavior , learning ability , or reproduction of F1 pups , and there was no effect on gross appearance of F2 pups ( offspring of F1 animals ) .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Tetracycline - class antibiotics are excreted in human milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse effects on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from tetracycline - class antibiotics , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use SOLODYN is indicated to treat only inflammatory lesions of non - nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 12 years and older .
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 has not been established .
Use of tetracycline - class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of SOLODYN did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
10 OVERDOSAGE In case of overdosage , discontinue medication , treat symptomatically , and institute supportive measures .
Minocycline is not removed in significant quantities by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of SOLODYN for the treatment of acne is unknown .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamics of SOLODYN for the treatment of acne are unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics SOLODYN Tablets are not bioequivalent to non - modified release minocycline products .
Based on pharmacokinetic studies in healthy adults , SOLODYN Tablets produce a delayed Tmax at 3 . 5 – 4 . 0 hours as compared to a non - modified release reference minocycline product ( Tmax at 2 . 25 – 3 hours ) .
At steady - state ( Day 6 ) , the mean AUC ( 0 – 24 ) and Cmax were 33 . 32 mcg × hr / mL and 2 . 63 mcg / mL for SOLODYN Tablets and 46 . 35 mcg × hr / mL and 2 . 92 mcg / mL for Minocin ® capsules , respectively .
These parameters are based on dose adjusted to 135 mg / day for both products .
A single - dose , four - way crossover study demonstrated that SOLODYN Tablets used in the study ( 45 mg , 90 mg , 135 mg ) exhibited dose - proportional pharmacokinetics .
In another single - dose , five - way crossover pharmacokinetic study , SOLODYN Tablets 55 mg , 80 mg , and 105 mg were shown to be dose - proportional to SOLODYN Tablets 90 mg and 135 mg .
When SOLODYN Tablets were administered concomitantly with a meal that included dairy products , the extent and timing of absorption of minocycline did not differ from that of administration under fasting conditions .
Minocycline is lipid soluble and distributes into the skin and sebum .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis — In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female rats once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 200 mg / kg / day , minocycline HCl was associated in both genders with follicular cell tumors of the thyroid gland , including increased incidences of adenomas , carcinomas and the combined incidence of adenomas and carcinomas in males , and adenomas and the combined incidence of adenomas and carcinomas in females .
In a carcinogenicity study in which minocycline HCl was orally administered to male and female mice once daily for up to 104 weeks at dosages up to 150 mg / kg / day , exposure to minocycline HCl did not result in a significantly increased incidence of neoplasms in either males or females .
Mutagenesis — Minocycline was not mutagenic in vitro in a bacterial reverse mutation assay ( Ames test ) or CHO / HGPRT mammalian cell assay in the presence or absence of metabolic activation .
Minocycline was not clastogenic in vitro using human peripheral blood lymphocytes or in vivo in a mouse micronucleus test .
Impairment of Fertility — Male and female reproductive performance in rats was unaffected by oral doses of minocycline of up to 300 mg / kg / day , which resulted in up to approximately 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of SOLODYN .
However , oral administration of 100 or 300 mg / kg / day of minocycline to male rats , resulting in approximately 15 to 40 times the level of systemic exposure to minocycline observed in patients as a result of use of SOLODYN , adversely affected spermatogenesis .
Effects observed at 300 mg / kg / day included a reduced number of sperm cells per gram of epididymis , an apparent reduction in the percentage of sperm that were motile , and ( at 100 and 300 mg / kg / day ) increased numbers of morphologically abnormal sperm cells .
Morphological abnormalities observed in sperm samples included absent heads , misshapen heads , and abnormal flagella .
Limited human studies suggest that minocycline may have a deleterious effect on spermatogenesis .
SOLODYN should not be used by individuals of either gender who are attempting to conceive a child .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of SOLODYN in the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non - nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris was assessed in two 12 - week , multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials in subjects ≥ 12 years .
The mean age of subjects was 20 years and subjects were from the following racial groups : White ( 73 % ) , Hispanic ( 13 % ) , Black ( 11 % ) , Asian / Pacific Islander ( 2 % ) , and Other ( 2 % ) .
In two efficacy and safety trials , a total of 924 subjects with non - nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris received SOLODYN or placebo for a total of 12 weeks , according to the following dose assignments .
