2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For single - use intravenous infusion only .
For patient selection : • Perform Factor IX inhibitor titer testing .
In case of a positive test result for human Factor IX inhibitors , perform a re - test within approximately 2 weeks .
If both the initial test and re - test results are positive , do not administer HEMGENIX to this patient .
• Perform liver health assessments , including : • Enzyme testing [ alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and total bilirubin ) ] , • Hepatic ultrasound and elastography .
In case of radiological liver abnormalities and / or sustained liver enzyme elevations , consider a consultation with hepatologist to assess eligibility for HEMGENIX [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
For single - use intravenous infusion only .
( 2 ) • Perform baseline testing to select patients , including testing for Factor IX inhibitor presence and liver health tests .
( 2 . 1 ) • The recommended dose of HEMGENIX is 2 × 1013 genome copies ( gc ) per kg of body weight .
( 2 . 1 ) • Administer HEMGENIX as an intravenous infusion after dilution with 0 . 9 % normal saline at a constant infusion rate of 500 ml / hour ( 8 mL / min ) .
( 2 . 1 ) 2 . 1 Dose The recommended dose of HEMGENIX is 2 × 1013 genome copies ( gc ) per kilogram ( kg ) of body weight ( or 2 mL / kg body weight ) administered as an intravenous infusion after dilution with 0 . 9 % sodium chloride solution ( normal saline ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Calculate the dose as follows : HEMGENIX dose ( in mL ) = patient body weight ( in kilogram ) × 2 The multiplication factor 2 represents the per kilogram dose ( 2 × 1013 gc / kg ) divided by the amount of genome copies per mL of the HEMGENIX solution ( 1 × 1013 gc / mL ) .
Number of HEMGENIX vials needed = HEMGENIX dose ( in mL ) divided by 10 ( round up to next whole number of vials ) .
The division factor 10 represents the extractable volume of HEMGENIX from each vial ( 10 mL ) .
The total volume of the patient ' s HEMGENIX dose to be diluted may be less than the total volume of vials needed .
Example calculation for 72 kg patient Patient Weight HEMGENIX dose ( mL ) ( body weight multiplied by 2 ) Number of Vials needed [ HEMGENIX dose ( mL ) divided by 10 , then rounded up ] 72 kg 144 mL 15 HEMGENIX can be administered only once .

If the infusion is stopped , restart at a slower rate when the infusion reaction is resolved .
• If the infusion rate needs to be reduced , or stopped and restarted , HEMGENIX should be infused within 24 hours after the dose preparation [ see How supplied / Storage and handling ( 16 . 2 ) ] .
• After the entire content of the bag ( s ) is infused , flush the IV infusion line / drip chamber at the same infusion rate with 0 . 9 % normal saline solution to ensure all HEMGENIX is delivered .
• Treat spills of HEMGENIX with a virucidal agent with proven activity against non - enveloped viruses .
• Dispose of unused product and disposable materials that may have come in contact with HEMGENIX in accordance with local biosafety guidelines applicable for handling and disposal of the pharmaceutical waste .
Monitoring Post - Administration Conduct the following tests after HEMGENIX administration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 3 , 5 . 4 ) ] : • Perform regular liver enzyme testing to monitor for liver enzyme elevations which may indicate immune - mediated hepatotoxicity : • Monitor ALT and AST ( transaminase ) levels by testing weekly for 3 months following administration of HEMGENIX .
Continue to monitor transaminases in all patients who developed liver enzyme elevations until liver enzymes return to baseline .
• In the event of ALT increase to above normal limits or to twice the patient ` s baseline in the first 3 months post - dose , consider implementing a course of corticosteroids .
For patients with clinically relevant ALT increases who need corticosteroid treatment , administer the recommended starting dose of 60 mg / day of oral prednisolone or prednisone , with a subsequent taper in response to normalization of the ALT levels ( see Table 1 ) : Table 1 .
Prednisolone Treatment Applied in Clinical Studies With HEMGENIX : Timeline [ 1 ] Prednisolone Oral Dose ( mg / day ) Week 1 60 Week 2 40 Week 3 30 Week 4 30 Maintenance dose until ALT level returns to baseline level 20 Taper dose after ALT baseline level has been reached Reduce daily dose by 5 mg / week [ 1 ] Medications equivalent to prednisolone may also be used .
A combined immunosuppressant regimen or the use of other products can be considered in case of prednisolone treatment failure or contraindication .
In the clinical studies , the mean duration of corticosteroid use for elevated transaminases was 81 . 4 days [ Standard Deviation ( SD ) 28 . 6 ] and ranged from 51 to 130 days [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
• Monitor Factor IX activity ( e . g . , weekly for 3 months ) .
• Monitor patients regularly for their Factor IX activity , in particular when exogenous Factor IX is administered .
It may take several weeks before improved hemostatic control becomes apparent after HEMGENIX infusion ; therefore , continued hemostatic support with exogenous human Factor IX may be needed during the first weeks after HEMGENIX infusion [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
• The use of different assays may impact the test results ; therefore , use the same assay and reagents to monitor patients over time , if feasible [ see Monitoring Laboratory Tests ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
• Use of exogenous Factor IX concentrates before and after HEMGENIX administration may impede assessment of endogenous , HEMGENIX - derived Factor IX activity .
• Perform regular alpha - fetoprotein ( AFP ) level testing and abdominal ultrasound ( e . g . , annually ) in patients with preexisting risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma ( e . g . , in patients with cirrhosis , advanced hepatic fibrosis , hepatitis B or C , non - alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) , chronic alcohol consumption , non - alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , and advanced age ) .
• Monitor patients for human Factor IX inhibitors .
Post - dose inhibitor testing should be performed if bleeding is not controlled , or plasma Factor IX activity levels decrease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .

( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Infusion reactions : Monitor during administration and for at least 3 hours after end of infusion .
If symptoms occur , slow or interrupt administration .
Re - start administration at a slower infusion once resolved .
( 2 . 3 , 5 . 1 ) • Hepatotoxicity : Closely monitor transaminase levels once per week for 3 months after HEMGENIX administration to mitigate the risk of potential hepatotoxicity .
Continue to monitor transaminases in all patients who developed liver enzyme elevations until liver enzymes return to baseline .
Consider corticosteroid treatment should elevations occur .
( 5 . 2 ) • Hepatocellular carcinogenicity : For patients with preexisting risk factors ( e . g . , cirrhosis , advanced hepatic fibrosis , hepatitis B or C , non - alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) , chronic alcohol consumption , non - alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , and advanced age ) , perform regular ( e . g . , annual ) liver ultrasound and alpha - fetoprotein testing following administration .
( 5 . 4 ) • Monitoring Laboratory tests : Monitor for Factor IX activity and Factor IX inhibitors .
( 5 . 5 ) 5 . 1 Infusion Reactions Infusion reactions , including hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis , may occur .
Symptoms may include chest tightness , headaches , abdominal pain , lightheadedness , flu - like symptoms , shivering , flushing , rash , and hypertension .
Closely monitor patients for signs or symptoms of an infusion reaction throughout the infusion period and for at least 3 hours after end of infusion .
Do not infuse the product faster than 500 mL / hour [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
In the event of an infusion reaction during administration , the infusion may be slowed or stopped .
If the infusion is stopped , restart at a slower rate when the infusion reaction has resolved .
Consider treatment with a corticosteroid or antihistamine for management of an infusion reaction [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 2 Hepatotoxicity Intravenous administration of a liver - directed AAV vector could potentially lead to liver transaminase elevations ( transaminitis ) .
Transaminitis , particularly when observed in the first 3 months after HEMGENIX administration , is presumed to occur due to immune - mediated injury of transduced hepatocytes and may reduce the therapeutic efficacy of the AAV - vector based gene therapy .
In clinical studies with HEMGENIX , most subjects had asymptomatic , and predominantly mild elevations in transaminases .
Elevated ALT levels occurred most often in the first 4 months after HEMGENIX administration .
There were some subjects who had a late onset of elevated ALT levels between Months 6 - 24 ( range = 42 IU / L - 193 IU / L ) ; however , all of these ALT values were < 2 × ULN with the exception of one subject .
Three additional subjects had AST elevations with onset and resolution between Months 6 and 12 ( range = 41 IU / L – 96 IU / L ) .
In one subject , an ALT elevation > 5 × ULN occurred 24 days after HEMGENIX administration and resolved by 51 days post - HEMGENIX administration .
There was one subject who had an AST elevation > 5 × ULN that occurred 11 months post - HEMGENIX administration and resolved to < 2 × ULN eight days later .
The majority of the elevated ALT values returned to baseline , however 9 subjects ' ALT values never resolved to normal ( range at 2 - year follow up = 48 IU / L – 193 IU / L ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Closely monitor transaminase levels once per week for 3 months after HEMGENIX administration to mitigate the risk of potential hepatotoxicity .
Continue to monitor transaminases in all patients who developed liver enzyme elevations until liver enzymes return to baseline [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
In case of increased ALT levels above the upper limit of normal or double baseline levels , consider implementing a course of corticosteroid , along with human Factor IX activity monitoring [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 3 Immune - mediated neutralization of the AAV5 vector capsid In AAV - vector based gene therapies , preexisting neutralizing anti - AAV antibodies may impede transgene expression at desired therapeutic levels .
Following treatment with HEMGENIX all subjects developed neutralizing anti - AAV antibodies .
Currently , there is no validated neutralizing anti - AAV5 antibody assay .
In the clinical studies with HEMGENIX , an unvalidated clinical trial assay was utilized to assess preexisting neutralizing anti - AAV5 antibodies .
The subject sub - group with detectable preexisting neutralizing anti - AAV5 antibodies up to titers of 1 : 678 showed mean Factor IX activity that was numerically lower compared to that subject sub - group without detectable preexisting neutralizing anti - AAV5 antibodies .
Subjects , with and without preexisting neutralizing anti - AAV5 antibodies , demonstrated hemostatic protection .
In one subject with a preexisting neutralizing anti - AAV5 antibody titer of 1 : 3212 , no human Factor IX expression was observed , and restart of the exogenous Factor IX prophylaxis was needed for bleeding events .
[ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Anti - AAV5 Antibody Study Patients who intend to receive treatment with HEMGENIX are encouraged to enroll in a study to measure pre - existing anti - AAV5 neutralizing antibodies by calling CSL Behring at 1 - 800 - 504 - 5434 .
The study evaluates the effect of pre - existing anti - AAV5 neutralizing antibodies on the risk of bleeding .
5 . 4 Hepatocellular carcinogenicity The integration of liver - targeting AAV vector DNA into the genome may carry the theoretical risk of hepatocellular carcinoma development .
HEMGENIX is composed of a non - replicating AAV5 vector whose DNA persists largely in episomal form .
Random integration of HEMGENIX vector DNA to the human DNA at low frequency is possible .
No HEMGENIX - associated clonal expansion or carcinogenicity was observed in clinical studies [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
One subject with preexisting risk factors for developing hepatic cancer developed a hepatocellular carcinoma , which was assessed as not likely related to HEMGENIX treatment based on vector integration site analyses and whole genome sequencing .
Patients with preexisting risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma ( e . g . , patients with cirrhosis , advanced hepatic fibrosis , hepatitis C or B , non - alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) , chronic alcohol consumption , non - alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , and advanced age ) should receive abdominal ultrasound screenings and be monitored regularly ( e . g . , annually ) for alpha - fetoprotein ( AFP ) elevations in the 5 years following administration [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 5 Monitoring Laboratory Tests After HEMGENIX administration , regularly monitor patient ' s Factor IX activity levels .
When using an in vitro activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) - based one - stage clotting assay ( OSA ) for determining Factor IX activity , plasma Factor IX activity results can be affected by both the type of aPTT reagent and the reference standard used in the assay .
This is important to consider particularly when changing the laboratory and / or reagents used in the assay .
Therefore , the same assay and reagents are recommended to be used to monitor Factor IX activity over time .
The results of Factor IX activity tests are lower if measured with chromogenic substrate assay ( CSA ) compared to OSA .
In the clinical efficacy study with HEMGENIX , the post - dose Factor IX activity measured with CSA returned lower values with the mean CSA to OSA Factor IX activity ratio ranging from 0 . 41 to 0 . 55 .
Monitor patients through appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests for the development of inhibitors to Factor IX after HEMGENIX administration .
Perform an assay that detects Factor IX inhibitors if bleeding is not controlled , or plasma Factor IX activity levels decrease .

Single intravenous infusion of HEMGENIX results in cell transduction and increase in circulating Factor IX activity in patients with Hemophilia B . 12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Factor IX activity The mean Factor IX activity levels over time , as measured by one - stage [ activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) - based ] assay are summarized in Table 3 .
Subjects achieved a mean ( ± SD ) uncontaminated ( i . e . , excluding measurements within five half - lives of Factor IX replacement therapy ) Factor IX activity levels of 39 % ( ± 18 . 7 ) , 41 . 5 % ( ± 21 . 7 ) , 36 . 9 % ( ± 21 . 4 ) and 36 . 7 ( ± 19 . 0 ) of normal , respectively , at 6 , 12 , 18 and 24 months .
The time to onset of Factor IX protein expression post - dose was detectable by first uncontaminated measurement at Week 3 in the clinical efficacy study ( N = 54 ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .

Specifically , the number of subjects excluded for contamination with Factor IX replacement therapy at Week 3 , Month 3 , Month 6 , Month 12 , Month 18 , and Month 24 , were 10 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 3 , 2 , respectively Pharmacodynamics in specific populations Age Limited data ( N = 7 ) from 60 - 75 years subgroup showed that the mean Factor IX activity levels were approximately up to 2 - fold higher in this subgroup compared to 18 to < 40 years age subgroup ( N = 31 ) , but comparable to 40 to < 60 years age subgroup ( N = 15 ) .
Hepatic Impairment In the clinical efficacy study , subjects with varying degree of baseline liver pathology , specifically the degree of hepatic steatosis with the Controlled Attenuation Parameter ( CAP ) score of ≥ S2 ( ≥ 260 decibels / m ; range : 262 to 400 ; n = 12 ) versus < S2 ( < 260 decibels / m ; range : 100 to 259 ; n = 28 ; ) and missing score ( n = 14 ) were compared [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The mean ( ± SD ) uncontaminated Factor IX activity for < S2 versus ≥ S2 subgroups at Months 6 , 12 , 18 , and 24 post dose were 40 . 8 ( ± 20 . 1 ) versus 34 . 5 ( ± 13 . 7 ) , 46 . 4 ( ± 24 . 1 ) versus 32 . 6 ( ± 18 . 6 ) , 41 . 6 ( ± 25 . 7 ) versus 29 . 2 ( ± 13 . 7 ) , and 40 . 2 ( ± 19 . 8 ) versus 28 . 4 ( ± 13 . 1 ) , respectively .
Subjects with advanced liver impairment and advanced fibrosis ( elastography of e . g . , ≥ 9 kPA , or suggestive of or equal to METAVIR Stage 3 disease ) , were not studied .
Renal Impairment In the clinical efficacy study , subjects with mild renal impairment ( creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) = 60 to 89 mL / min defined by Cockcroft - Gault equation , n = 7 ) had about 37 % higher Factor IX activity relative to those with normal renal function ( CLcr ≥ 90 mL / min ; n = 45 ) following HEMGENIX administration .
One subject with moderate renal impairment ( CLcr = 30 to 59 mL / min ) had similar Factor IX activity as subjects with normal renal function .
HEMGENIX was not studied in subjects with severe renal impairment ( CLcr = 15 to 29 mL / min ) or end - stage renal disease ( CLcr < 15 mL / min ) .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Vector Biodistribution ( within the body ) and Vector Shedding ( excretion / secretion ) Nonclinical data Biodistribution of HEMGENIX was evaluated after intravenous administration in healthy male mice and non - human primates ( NHPs ) .
The highest levels of vector DNA were detected in the liver and adrenal glands in both species .
Vector DNA was also detected in all reproductive tissues examined ( epididymis , seminal vesicles , and testes ) .
In a mating study evaluating a predecessor of HEMGENIX , transmission of vector DNA to naïve female mice following mating with dosed males was not observed [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 2 ) ] .
Clinical data Following administration of the predecessor of HEMGENIX at doses of 5 × 1012 ( N = 5 ) and 2 × 1013 gc / kg ( N = 5 ) in a clinical study , the pharmacokinetics of vector DNA in blood and viral shedding in saliva , nasal secretions , semen , urine , and feces were characterized .
Clearance of vector DNA as confirmed by 3 subsequent measurements below limit of detection ( LOD ) , was achieved in all subjects at both dose levels from all the matrices except for semen , where clearance was achieved in 9 / 10 subjects .
One subject was unable to produce semen due to a historical medical condition and , therefore , shedding from semen could not be assessed .
The maximum time to clearance of vector DNA was 22 weeks for urine , 26 weeks for saliva and nasal secretions , 40 weeks for feces , 52 weeks for semen , and 159 weeks for blood .
Subsequently , the pharmacokinetics of vector DNA in blood , and viral shedding in semen following HEMGENIX administration was characterized in 2 clinical studies .
In an initial clinical study ( N = 3 ) , clearance of vector DNA from semen and blood ( i . e . , confirmed with 3 subsequent measurements below LOD of vector DNA ) was achieved in 2 / 3 subjects , and in all subjects , respectively , after 3 years post - administration .
One subject did not return the required number of semen samples to assess the shedding status as per the definition of 3 subsequent measurements below LOD of vector DNA .
In the clinical efficacy study ( N = 54 ) , a total of 56 % ( 30 / 54 ) of subjects achieved absence of vector DNA from blood and 69 % ( 37 / 54 ) from semen by Month 24 .
Several subjects did not return the required number of blood and semen samples to assess the shedding status as per the definition of 3 subsequent measurements below LOD of vector DNA .
Considering results obtained from 2 available consecutive samples below LOD , a total of 40 / 54 ( 74 % ) and 47 / 54 ( 87 % ) subjects were identified to have reached absence of vector DNA from blood and semen , respectively , at 24 months post - administration .
12 . 6 Immunogenicity In clinical studies sustained humoral immune response to infused AAV5 capsid was observed in all subjects following treatment with HEMGENIX .
The neutralizing anti - AAV5 antibody levels raised above the upper limit of quantification by week 3 post - administration and remained elevated , as measured at month 24 post - dose .
Re - administration of HEMGENIX in the presence of high anti - AAV5 antibody titer has not been evaluated .
Currently , there is no validated neutralizing anti - AAV5 antibody assay .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY Nonclinical studies were initiated with a predecessor of HEMGENIX product , rAAV5 expressing the wild type human coagulation factor IX ( rAAV5 - hFIX ) .
HEMGENIX was developed by introducing a 2 - nucleotide change in the transgene for hFIX , generating the naturally occurring Padua variant of Factor IX ( rAAV5 - hFIX - Padua ) .
13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No traditional nonclinical carcinogenicity or mutagenicity studies were conducted with HEMGENIX ; such studies were not indicated .
No adverse effects were observed in mating rates and fertility indices in healthy naïve female mice following mating with males that were administered the predecessor of HEMGENIX [ see Use in specific populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
To evaluate vector integration , host genomic DNA was isolated from liver tissue obtained from healthy mice and NHPs following intravenous administration of the predecessor of HEMGENIX .
For both species , the identified rAAV5 - hFIX vector DNA sequences represented episomal forms that were not integrated into the host DNA .
A low level of integrated rAAV5 - hFIX DNA was distributed throughout the host genome with no predilection to specific integration sites , including in genes associated with malignant transformation in humans .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology A pharmacology study was conducted in a murine model of Hemophilia B ( B6 . 129P2 - F9tm1Dws .
Intravenous administration of the predecessor of HEMGENIX at dose levels ranging from 5 × 1011 to 2 . 3 × 1014 gc / kg , resulted in dose - dependent increases in plasma hFIX protein levels , plasma hFIX clotting activity , and vector transduction in the liver at 4 weeks post - dose .
Intravenous administration of HEMGENIX resulted in a no - observed - adverse - effect - level of 5 × 1013 gc / kg ( the maximum dose level administered ) in healthy mice and 9 × 1013 gc / kg in NHPs .
Vector biodistribution to the liver and hFIX protein levels in the plasma occurred in a dose - dependent manner in both species .
Anti - hFIX antibodies developed in 5 out of 12 NHPs administered HEMGENIX , which correlated with a decline in circulating hFIX protein levels beginning at 13 weeks post - dose .
One out of 10 healthy mice administered 5 × 1013 gc / kg of HEMGENIX or the predecessor of HEMGENIX developed pulmonary thrombi at 13 weeks post - dose .
This dose level is 2 . 5 - fold higher than the recommended dose level for HEMGENIX .
Compared to concurrent controls , prolonged prothrombin time , decreased activated partial thromboplastin time and decreased heart rates were observed in NHPs administered 9 × 1013 gc / kg of HEMGENIX during the 26 - week study .
This dose level is 4 . 5 - fold higher than the recommended dose level for HEMGENIX .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of HEMGENIX was evaluated in a prospective , open - label , single - dose , single - arm , multi - national study ( N = 54 ) .
The study enrolled adult male subjects aged 19 to 75 years , with severe or moderately severe Hemophilia B , who received a single intravenous dose of 2 × 1013 gc / kg body weight of HEMGENIX and entered a follow - up period of 5 years .
The study is on - going .
The 54 subjects prospectively completed a lead - in period of at least six months with the intent to receive standard of care routine Factor IX prophylaxis .
These 54 subjects then received the indicated single intravenous dose of HEMGENIX .
Subjects were then followed up monthly until Month 12 , and then at 6 - month intervals until Year 5 .
For the efficacy evaluation , data up to 18 months post - treatment were used .
Of the 54 subjects , 53 subjects completed at least 18 months of follow - up in the ongoing study .
One subject with numerous cardiovascular and urologic risk factors , aged 75 years at screening , died of urosepsis and cardiogenic shock at Month 15 post - dose ( at age 77 years ) unrelated to treatment .
Another subject received around 10 % of the intended dose of HEMGENIX due to an infusion - related hypersensitivity reaction .
The main efficacy outcome was a non - inferiority test of annualized bleeding rate ( ABR ) during Months 7 to 18 after HEMGENIX treatment compared with ABR during the lead - in period .
All bleeding episodes , regardless of investigator assessment , were counted .
Subjects were allowed to continue prophylaxis during Months 0 to 6 .
The estimated mean ABR during Months 7 to 18 after HEMGENIX treatment was 1 . 9 bleeds / year with a 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) of ( 1 . 0 , 3 . 4 ) , compared with an estimated mean ABR of 4 . 1 [ 95 % CI : 3 . 2 , 5 . 4 ] during the lead - in period .
The ABR ratio ( Months 7 to 18 post - treatment / lead - in ) was 0 . 46 [ 95 % CI : 0 . 26 , 0 . 81 ] , demonstrating non - inferiority of ABR during Months 7 to 18 compared to the lead - in period .
Two subjects were not able to stop routine prophylaxis after HEMGENIX treatment .
During Months 7 to 18 , an additional subject received prophylaxis from Days 396 - 534 [ approximately 20 weeks ] .

Not all subjects complied with their prescribed prophylaxis regimen during the lead - in period .
[ 2 ] Efficacy evaluation started from Month 7 after HEMGENIX treatment , to allow Factor IX expression to reach a steady state .
[ 3 ] An ABR of 20 was imputed for the period when three subjects were on continuous prophylaxis .
[ 4 ] Non - inferiority comparison and mean ABR estimates were based on a repeated measures generalized estimating equations negative binomial regression model .
[ 5 ] For spontaneous and joint bleed counts , no imputation was done for the three subjects receiving continuous prophylaxis during Months 7 to 18 .
After a single - dose of HEMGENIX , increases in Factor IX activity were observed [ see Pharmacokinetics ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
