• None ( 4 ) .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • QT / QTc Interval Prolongation : Androgen deprivation therapy may prolong the QT interval ( 5 . 1 ) .
• Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : ORGOVYX can cause fetal harm .
Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception ( 5 . 2 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) .
5 . 1 QT / QTc Interval Prolongation Androgen deprivation therapy , such as ORGOVYX may prolong the QT / QTc interval .
Providers should consider whether the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy outweigh the potential risks in patients with congenital long QT syndrome , congestive heart failure , or frequent electrolyte abnormalities and in patients taking drugs known to prolong the QT interval .
Electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected .
Consider periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and electrolytes [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 2 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity The safety and efficacy of ORGOVYX have not been established in females .
Based on findings in animals and mechanism of action , ORGOVYX can cause fetal harm and loss of pregnancy when administered to a pregnant female .
In an animal reproduction study , oral administration of relugolix to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused embryo - fetal lethality at maternal exposures that were 0 . 3 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 120 mg daily based on area under the curve ( AUC ) .
Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose of ORGOVYX [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 3 Laboratory Testing Therapy with ORGOVYX results in suppression of the pituitary gonadal system .
Results of diagnostic tests of the pituitary gonadotropic and gonadal functions conducted during and after ORGOVYX may be affected .
The therapeutic effect of ORGOVYX should be monitored by measuring serum concentrations of prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) periodically .
If PSA increases , serum concentrations of testosterone should be measured .

Each tablet contains 120 mg of relugolix .
The inactive ingredients are mannitol , sodium starch glycolate , hydroxypropyl cellulose , magnesium stearate , hypromellose , titanium dioxide , ferric oxide red , and carnauba wax .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Relugolix is a nonpeptide GnRH receptor antagonist that competitively binds to pituitary GnRH receptors , thereby , reducing the release of luteinizing hormone ( LH ) and follicle - stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , and consequently testosterone .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Pituitary and Gonadal Hormones Relugolix reduced LH , FSH ( Figure 1 ) , and testosterone concentrations after oral administration of the recommended loading dose of 360 mg and a 120 mg dose once daily .
Out of 622 patients , 56 % had testosterone concentrations at castrate levels ( < 50 ng / dL ) by the first sampling timepoint at Day 4 , and 97 % maintained castrate levels of testosterone through 48 weeks .
In a substudy of 137 patients who did not receive subsequent androgen deprivation therapy for at least 90 days after discontinuation of relugolix , the cumulative incidence rate of achieving testosterone concentrations above the lower limit of the normal range ( > 280 ng / dL ) or baseline at 90 days was 55 % [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Figure 1 : Mean ( ± 95 % CI ) Follicle - Stimulating Hormone and Luteinizing Hormone Concentrations over Time in HERO [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized , double - blind , placebo - and positive - controlled ( open - label moxifloxacin ) , parallel - group thorough QT / QTc study , no increase in mean QTc interval > 10 ms was identified after administration of single 60 or 360 mg doses of relugolix ( 0 . 2 or 1 times the recommended loading dose , respectively ) .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics After administration of single doses ranging from 60 mg to 360 mg ( 0 . 17 to 1 times the recommended loading dose ) , the AUC from time zero extrapolated to infinity ( AUC0 - inf ) and the maximum observed plasma concentration ( Cmax ) of relugolix increase approximately proportionally with dose .
After administration of multiple 20 mg to 180 mg doses of relugolix once daily ( 0 . 17 to 1 . 5 times the recommended once daily dose ) , the AUCtau of relugolix increases approximately proportionally with dose and the Cmax increases greater than proportionally to dose .
After administration of a single 360 mg loading dose in patients , the mean ( ± standard deviation [ ± SD ] ) of AUC0 - 24 and Cmax of relugolix were 985 ( ± 742 ) ng . hr / mL and 215 ( ± 184 ) ng / mL , respectively .
After administration of a 120 mg dose once daily in patients , the mean ( ± SD ) of AUC0 - 24 and Cmax of relugolix at steady - state were 407 ( ± 168 ) ng . hr / mL and 70 ( ± 65 ) ng / mL , respectively .
The accumulation of relugolix upon once daily administration is approximately 2 - fold .
Absorption Relugolix is a substrate for intestinal P - gp .

Distribution Plasma protein binding of relugolix is 68 to 71 % , primarily to albumin and to a lesser extent to α1 - acid glycoprotein .
The mean blood - to - plasma ratio is 0 . 78 .
Elimination The mean effective half - life of relugolix is 25 hours and the mean ( CV % ) terminal elimination half - life is 60 . 8 ( 11 % ) hours .
The mean ( CV % ) total clearance of relugolix is 29 . 4 ( 15 % ) L / h and the renal clearance is 8 L / h .
Metabolism Relugolix is metabolized primarily by CYP3A and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8 in vitro .
Excretion After oral administration of a single 80 - mg radiolabeled dose of relugolix , approximately 81 % of the radioactivity was recovered in feces ( 4 . 2 % as unchanged ) and 4 . 1 % in urine ( 2 . 2 % as unchanged ) .
Specific Populations No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of relugolix were observed based on age ( 45 to 91 years ) , race / ethnicity ( Asian [ 19 % ] , White [ 71 % ] , Black / African American [ 6 % ] ) , body weight ( 41 to 193 kg ) , mild to severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance [ CLcr ] 15 to 89 mL / min , as estimated by the Cockcroft - Gault equation ) , or mild to moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh A or B ) .
The effect of end - stage renal disease with or without hemodialysis or severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) on the pharmacokinetics of relugolix has not been evaluated .
Drug Interactions Studies Clinical Studies Combined P - gp and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitor : Co - administration with erythromycin ( P - gp and moderate CYP3A inhibitor ) increased the AUC and Cmax of relugolix by 6 . 2 - fold .
Combined P - gp and Strong CYP3A Inducer : Co - administration with rifampin ( P - gp and strong CYP3A inducer ) decreased the AUC and Cmax of relugolix by 55 % and 23 % , respectively .
Other Drugs : No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of relugolix were observed when co - administered with voriconazole ( strong CYP3A inhibitor ) , atorvastatin , enzalutamide , or acid - reducing agents .
No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of midazolam ( sensitive CYP3A substrate ) or rosuvastatin ( BCRP substrate ) were observed upon co - administration with relugolix .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Two - year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice at oral relugolix doses up to 100 mg / kg / day and in rats at doses up to 600 mg / kg / day .
Relugolix was not carcinogenic in mice or rats at exposures up to approximately 75 or 224 times , respectively , the human exposure at the recommended dose of 120 mg daily based on AUC .
Relugolix was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay or clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells or the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay .
In human GnRH - receptor knock - in male mice , oral administration of relugolix decreased prostate and seminal vesicle weights at doses ≥ 3 mg / kg twice daily for 28 days .
The effects of relugolix were reversible , except for testis weight , which did not fully recover within 28 days after drug withdrawal .
In a 39 - week repeat - dose toxicity study in monkeys , there were no significant effects on male reproductive organs at oral relugolix doses up to 50 mg / kg / day ( approximately 53 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 120 mg daily based on AUC ) .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Phospholipidosis ( intracellular phospholipid accumulation ) was observed in multiple organs and tissues ( e . g . , liver , pancreas , spleen , kidney , lymph nodes , lung , bone marrow , gastrointestinal tract or testes ) after repeated oral administration of relugolix in rats and monkeys .
In a rat 26 - week toxicity study , phospholipidosis was observed at doses ≥ 100 mg / kg ( approximately 18 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC ) .
In a monkey 39 - week toxicity study , this effect was observed at doses ≥ 1 . 5 mg / kg ( approximately 0 . 6 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC ) and demonstrated evidence of reversibility after cessation of treatment .
The significance of this finding in humans is unknown .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES HERO Study The safety and efficacy of ORGOVYX was evaluated in HERO ( NCT03085095 ) , a randomized , open label study in men with advanced prostate cancer requiring at least 1 year of androgen deprivation therapy and defined as biochemical ( PSA ) or clinical relapse following local primary intervention , newly diagnosed castration - sensitive metastatic disease , or advanced localized disease .
A total of 934 patients were randomized to receive ORGOVYX or leuprolide in a 2 : 1 ratio for 48 weeks : • ORGOVYX at a loading dose of 360 mg on the first day followed by daily doses of 120 mg orally .
• Leuprolide acetate 22 . 5 mg injection ( or 11 . 25 mg in Japan and Taiwan ) subcutaneously every 3 months .
Leuprolide acetate 11 . 25 mg is a dosage regimen that is not recommended for this indication in the US .
Serum testosterone concentrations were measured at screening ; on Days 1 , 4 , 8 , 15 , and 29 in the first month ; then monthly until the end of the study .
The population ( N = 930 ) across both treatment groups had a median age of 71 years ( range 47 to 97 years ) .
The ethnic / racial distribution was 68 % White , 21 % Asian , 4 . 9 % Black , and 5 % other .
Disease stage was distributed as follows : 32 % metastatic ( M1 ) , 31 % locally advanced ( T3 / 4 NX M0 or any T N1 M0 ) , 28 % localized ( T1 or T2 N0 M0 ) , and 10 % not classifiable .
The median testosterone concentration at baseline across the treatment groups was 408 ng / dL .
The major efficacy outcome measure was medical castration rate defined as achieving and maintaining serum testosterone suppression to castrate levels ( < 50 ng / dL ) by Day 29 through 48 weeks of treatment .
Other endpoints included castration rates on Day 4 and 15 and castration rates with testosterone < 20 ng / dL at Day 15 .
The efficacy results are shown in Table 3 and the timecourse of percent change from baseline in testosterone suppression by ORGOVYX and leuprolide during the 48 week treatment period are shown in Figure 2 .

Figure 3 : Cumulative Incidence of Time to Testosterone < 50 ng / dL and < 20 ng / dL in HERO [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] In the clinical trial , PSA levels were monitored and were lowered on average by 65 % two weeks after administration of ORGOVYX , 83 % after 4 weeks , 92 % after 3 months and remained suppressed throughout the 48 weeks of treatment .
These PSA results should be interpreted with caution because of the heterogeneity of the patient population studied .
No evidence has shown that the rapidity of PSA decline is related to a clinical benefit .
A substudy was conducted in 137 patients who did not receive subsequent androgen deprivation therapy for at least 90 days after discontinuation of ORGOVYX .
Based on Kaplan - Meier analyses , 55 % of patients achieved testosterone levels above the lower limit of the normal range ( > 280 ng / dL ) or baseline at 90 days after discontinuation of ORGOVYX .
