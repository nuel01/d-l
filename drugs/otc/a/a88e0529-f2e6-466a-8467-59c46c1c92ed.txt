• Patients who are not currently vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis , unless the risks of delaying ULTOMIRIS treatment outweigh the risks of developing a meningococcal infection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
ULTOMIRIS is contraindicated in : • Patients with unresolved Neisseria meningitidis infection ( 4 ) .
• Patients who are not currently vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis , unless the risks of delaying ULTOMIRIS treatment outweigh the risks of developing a meningococcal infection ( 4 , 5 . 1 ) .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Other Infections : Use caution when administering ULTOMIRIS to patients with any other systemic infection ( 5 . 2 ) .
• Infusion - Related Reactions : Monitor patients during infusion , interrupt for reactions , and institute appropriate supportive measures ( 5 . 5 ) .
5 . 1 Serious Meningococcal Infections Risk and Prevention Life - threatening meningococcal infections have occurred in patients treated with ULTOMIRIS .
The use of ULTOMIRIS increases a patient ' s susceptibility to serious meningococcal infections ( septicemia and / or meningitis ) .
Meningococcal disease due to any serogroup may occur .
Vaccinate for meningococcal disease according to the most current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) recommendations for patients with complement deficiencies .
Revaccinate patients in accordance with ACIP recommendations considering the duration of ULTOMIRIS therapy .
Immunize patients without a history of meningococcal vaccination at least 2 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of ULTOMIRIS .
If urgent ULTOMIRIS therapy is indicated in an unvaccinated patient , administer meningococcal vaccine ( s ) as soon as possible and provide patients with 2 weeks of antibacterial drug prophylaxis .
In clinical studies , 59 adult patients with PNH and 2 adult patients with gMG were treated with ULTOMIRIS less than 2 weeks after meningococcal vaccination .
All of these patients received antibiotics for prophylaxis of meningococcal infection until at least 2 weeks after meningococcal vaccination .
The benefits and risks of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of meningococcal infections in patients receiving ULTOMIRIS have not been established .
Vaccination reduces , but does not eliminate , the risk of meningococcal infections .
In PNH clinical studies in adult patients , 3 out of 261 PNH patients developed serious meningococcal infections / sepsis while receiving treatment with ULTOMIRIS ; all 3 had been vaccinated .
These 3 patients recovered while continuing treatment with ULTOMIRIS .
In the PNH study in pediatric patients , no meningococcal infections occurred among the 13 patients receiving treatment with ULTOMIRIS .
Closely monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection and evaluate patients immediately if infection is suspected .
Inform patients of these signs and symptoms and steps to be taken to seek immediate medical care .
Meningococcal infection may become rapidly life - threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early .
Consider discontinuation of ULTOMIRIS in patients who are undergoing treatment for serious meningococcal infection .
REMS Due to the risk of meningococcal infections , ULTOMIRIS is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS ) .
Under the ULTOMIRIS REMS , prescribers must enroll in the program .
Prescribers must counsel patients about the risk of meningococcal infection / sepsis , provide the patients with the REMS educational materials , and ensure patients are vaccinated with meningococcal vaccines .
Enrollment in the ULTOMIRIS REMS and additional information are available by telephone : 1 - 888 - 765 - 4747 or at www . ultomirisrems . com .
5 . 2 Other Infections ULTOMIRIS blocks terminal complement activation ; therefore , patients may have increased susceptibility to infections , especially with encapsulated bacteria , such as infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis but also Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , and to a lesser extent , Neisseria gonorrhoeae .
Children treated with ULTOMIRIS may be at increased risk of developing serious infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) .
Administer vaccinations for the prevention of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) infections according to ACIP guidelines .
If ULTOMIRIS therapy is administered to patients with active systemic infections , monitor closely for signs and symptoms of worsening infection .
5 . 3 Monitoring Disease Manifestations after ULTOMIRIS Discontinuation Treatment Discontinuation for PNH After discontinuing treatment with ULTOMIRIS , closely monitor for signs and symptoms of hemolysis , identified by elevated LDH along with sudden decrease in PNH clone size or hemoglobin , or reappearance of symptoms such as fatigue , hemoglobinuria , abdominal pain , shortness of breath ( dyspnea ) , major adverse vascular event ( including thrombosis ) , dysphagia , or erectile dysfunction .
Monitor any patient who discontinues ULTOMIRIS for at least 16 weeks to detect hemolysis and other reactions .
If signs and symptoms of hemolysis occur after discontinuation , including elevated LDH , consider restarting treatment with ULTOMIRIS .
Treatment Discontinuation for aHUS ULTOMIRIS treatment of aHUS should be a minimum duration of 6 months .
Due to heterogeneous nature of aHUS events and patient - specific risk factors , treatment duration beyond the initial 6 months should be individualized .
There are no specific data on ULTOMIRIS discontinuation .
After discontinuing treatment with ULTOMIRIS , patients should be monitored for clinical symptoms and laboratory signs of TMA complications for at least 12 months .
TMA complications post - discontinuation can be identified if any of the following is observed : • Clinical symptoms of TMA include changes in mental status , seizures , angina , dyspnea , thrombosis or increasing blood pressure .
• In addition , at least two of the following laboratory signs observed concurrently and results should be confirmed by a second measurement 28 days apart with no interruption • a decrease in platelet count of 25 % or more as compared to either baseline or to peak platelet count during ULTOMIRIS treatment ; • an increase in serum creatinine of 25 % or more as compared to baseline or to nadir during ULTOMIRIS treatment ; • an increase in serum LDH of 25 % or more as compared to baseline or to nadir during ULTOMIRIS treatment .
If TMA complications occur after ULTOMIRIS discontinuation , consider reinitiation of ULTOMIRIS treatment or appropriate organ - specific supportive measures .
5 . 4 Thromboembolic Event Management The effect of withdrawal of anticoagulant therapy during ULTOMIRIS treatment has not been established .
Therefore , treatment with ULTOMIRIS should not alter anticoagulant management .
5 . 5 Infusion - Related Reactions Administration of ULTOMIRIS may result in infusion - related reactions , including anaphylaxis [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 3 ) ] and hypersensitivity reactions .
In clinical trials , infusion - related reactions occurred in approximately 1 % of patients treated with ULTOMIRIS .
These events included lower back pain , drop in blood pressure , elevation in blood pressure , limb discomfort , drug hypersensitivity ( allergic reaction ) , dysgeusia ( bad taste ) , and drowsiness .
These reactions did not require discontinuation of ULTOMIRIS .
If signs of cardiovascular instability or respiratory compromise occur , interrupt ULTOMIRIS infusion and institute appropriate supportive measures .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling : • Serious Meningococcal Infections [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Other Infections [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Infusion - Related Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] Most common adverse reactions in patients with PNH ( incidence ≥ 10 % ) were upper respiratory tract infection and headache ( 6 . 1 ) .

Generalized Myasthenia Gravis ( gMG ) Adult Population with gMG The safety of ULTOMIRIS has been evaluated in 175 adult patients with gMG , including 169 patients who received at least one dose of ULTOMIRIS , 142 patients who were exposed for at least 6 months , and 95 who were exposed for at least 12 months [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
In a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial ( ALXN1210 - MG - 306 ) , the most frequent adverse reactions ( ≥ 10 % ) with ULTOMIRIS were diarrhea and upper respiratory tract infection .
Table 14 describes adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of 5 % or more and at greater frequency than placebo .
Serious adverse reactions were reported in 20 ( 23 % ) patients with gMG receiving ULTOMIRIS and in 14 ( 16 % ) patients receiving placebo .
The most frequent serious adverse reactions were infections reported in at least 8 ( 9 % ) patients treated with ULTOMIRIS and in 4 ( 4 % ) patients treated with placebo [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Of these infections , one fatal case of COVID - 19 pneumonia was identified in a patient treated with ULTOMIRIS and one case of infection led to discontinuation of ULTOMIRIS .

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibodies ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other ravulizumab - cwvz products may be misleading .
The immunogenicity of ravulizumab - cwvz has been evaluated using an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) for the detection of binding anti - ravulizumab - cwvz antibodies .
For patients whose sera tested positive in the screening immunoassay , an in vitro biological assay was performed to detect neutralizing antibodies .
In clinical studies , treatment - emergent antibodies to ravulizumab - cwvz were detected in 1 of 219 ( 0 . 5 % ) patients with PNH and 1 of 71 ( 1 . 4 % ) patients with aHUS .
In these 2 patient populations , no apparent correlation of antibody development to altered pharmacokinetic profile , clinical response , or adverse events was observed .
No treatment - emergent antibodies to ravulizumab - cwvz were detected in patients with gMG treated with ULTOMIRIS .
However , the assay used to measure anti - drug antibodies ( ADA ) is subject to interference by serum ravulizumab - cwvz , possibly resulting in an underestimation of the incidence of antibody formation .
Due to the limitation of the assay conditions , the potential clinical impact of antibodies to ravulizumab - cwvz is not known .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of ULTOMIRIS .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to ULTOMIRIS exposure .
Serious Adverse Reaction : Anaphylaxis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Plasma Exchange , Plasmapheresis , or Intravenous Immunoglobulins : concomitant use requires supplemental dose of ULTOMIRIS ( 7 . 1 ) .
• Neonatal Fc Receptor Blockers : Closely monitor for reduced effectiveness of ULTOMIRIS ( 7 . 2 ) .
7 . 1 Plasma Exchange , Plasmapheresis , and Intravenous Immunoglobulins Concomitant use of ULTOMIRIS with plasma exchange ( PE ) , plasmapheresis ( PP ) , or intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) treatment can reduce serum ravulizumab concentrations and requires a supplemental dose of ULTOMIRIS [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Neonatal Fc Receptor Blockers Concomitant use of ULTOMIRIS with neonatal Fc receptor ( FcRn ) blockers ( e . g . , efgartigimod ) may lower systemic exposures and reduce effectiveness of ULTOMIRIS .
Closely monitor for reduced effectiveness of ULTOMIRIS .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ULTOMIRIS use in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated PNH and aHUS in pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
Animal studies using a mouse analogue of the ravulizumab - cwvz molecule ( murine anti - C5 antibody ) showed increased rates of developmental abnormalities and an increased rate of dead and moribund offspring at doses 0 . 8 - 2 . 2 times the human dose ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or fetal / neonatal risk PNH in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes , including worsening cytopenias , thrombotic events , infections , bleeding , miscarriages , and increased maternal mortality , and adverse fetal outcomes , including fetal death and premature delivery .
In pregnancy , aHUS is associated with adverse maternal outcomes , including preeclampsia and preterm delivery , and adverse fetal / neonatal outcomes , including intrauterine growth restriction ( IUGR ) , fetal death and low birth weight .
Data Animal Data Animal reproduction studies were conducted in mice using doses of a murine anti - C5 antibody that approximated 1 - 2 . 2 times ( loading dose ) and 0 . 8 - 1 . 8 times ( maintenance dose ) the recommended human ULTOMIRIS dose , based on a body weight comparison .
When animal exposure to the antibody occurred in the time period from before mating until early gestation , no decrease in fertility or reproductive performance was observed .
When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred during organogenesis , two cases of retinal dysplasia and one case of umbilical hernia were observed among 230 offspring born to mothers exposed to the higher antibody dose ; however , the exposure did not increase fetal loss or neonatal death .
When maternal exposure to the antibody occurred in the time period from implantation through weaning , a higher number of male offspring became moribund or died ( 1 / 25 controls , 2 / 25 low dose group , 5 / 25 high dose group ) .
Surviving offspring had normal development and reproductive function .
Human IgG are known to cross the human placental barrier , and thus ULTOMIRIS may potentially cause terminal complement inhibition in fetal circulation .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk summary There are no data on the presence of ravulizumab - cwvz in human milk , the effect on the breastfed child , or the effect on milk production .
Since many medicinal products and immunoglobulins are secreted into human milk , and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a nursing child , breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment and for 8 months after the final dose .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ULTOMIRIS for the treatment of PNH have been established in pediatric patients aged one month and older .
Use of ULTOMIRIS for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled trials in adults with additional pharmacokinetic , efficacy and safety data in pediatric patients aged 9 to 17 years [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
The safety and efficacy for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with PNH appear similar .
Use of ULTOMIRIS in pediatric patients with PNH aged less than 9 years and body weight < 30 kg is based on extrapolation of pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic ( PK / PD ) , and efficacy and safety data from aHUS and PNH clinical studies [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of ULTOMIRIS for the treatment of aHUS have been established in pediatric patients aged one month and older .
Use of ULTOMIRIS for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies in adults with additional pharmacokinetic , safety , and efficacy data in pediatric patients aged 10 months to < 17 years .
The safety and efficacy of ULTOMIRIS for the treatment of aHUS appear similar in pediatric and adult patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Safety and effectiveness of ULTOMIRIS for the treatment of gMG in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ULTOMIRIS did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over ( 58 patients with PNH , 9 with aHUS , and 54 with gMG ) to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients .
11 DESCRIPTION Ravulizumab - cwvz , a complement inhibitor , is a humanized monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) produced in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells .
Ravulizumab - cwvz consists of 2 identical 448 amino acid heavy chains and 2 identical 214 amino acid light chains and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kDa .
The constant regions of ravulizumab - cwvz include the human kappa light chain constant region , and the protein engineered " IgG2 / 4 " heavy chain constant region .
The heavy chain CH1 domain , hinge region , and the first 5 amino acids of the CH2 domain match the human IgG2 amino acid sequence , residues 6 to 36 in the CH2 region ( common to both human IgG2 and IgG4 amino acid sequences ) , while the remainder of the CH2 domain and the CH3 domain match the human IgG4 amino acid sequence .
The heavy and light chain variable regions that form the human C5 binding site consist of human framework regions grafted to murine complementarity - determining regions .
ULTOMIRIS 100 mg / mL ( 3 mL and 11 mL vials ) ULTOMIRIS ( ravulizumab - cwvz ) injection 100 mg / mL is a sterile , translucent , clear to yellowish color , preservative - free solution for intravenous use .
Each single - dose vial contains 300 mg or 1 , 100 mg ravulizumab - cwvz at a concentration of 100 mg / mL with a pH of 7 . 4 .
Each mL also contains L - arginine ( 4 . 33 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 0 . 5 mg ) ( vegetable origin ) , sodium phosphate dibasic ( 4 . 42 mg ) , sodium phosphate monobasic ( 4 . 57 mg ) , sucrose ( 50 mg ) and Water for Injection , USP .
ULTOMIRIS 10 mg / mL ( 30 mL vial ) ULTOMIRIS ( ravulizumab - cwvz ) injection 10 mg / mL is a sterile , clear to translucent , slight whitish color , preservative - free solution for intravenous use .
Each single - dose vial contains 300 mg ravulizumab - cwvz at a concentration of 10 mg / mL with a pH of 7 . 0 .
Each mL also contains polysorbate 80 ( 0 . 2 mg ) ( vegetable origin ) , sodium chloride ( 8 . 77 mg ) , sodium phosphate dibasic ( 1 . 78 mg ) , sodium phosphate monobasic ( 0 . 46 mg ) , and Water for Injection , USP .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Ravulizumab - cwvz is a terminal complement inhibitor that specifically binds to the complement protein C5 with high affinity , thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a ( the proinflammatory anaphylatoxin ) and C5b ( the initiating subunit of the membrane attack complex [ MAC or C5b - 9 ] ) thus preventing MAC formation .
ULTOMIRIS inhibits terminal complement - mediated intravascular hemolysis in patients with PNH and complement - mediated thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) in patients with aHUS .
The precise mechanism by which ravulizumab - cwvz exerts its therapeutic effect in gMG patients is unknown , but is presumed to involve reduction of terminal complement complex C5b - 9 deposition at the neuromuscular junction .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Complete inhibition of serum free C5 ( concentration of less than 0 . 5 mcg / mL ) was observed by the end of the first ULTOMIRIS infusion and sustained throughout the entire 26 - week treatment period in both adult and pediatric patients with PNH , in the majority ( 93 % ) of adult and pediatric patients with aHUS , and all adult patients with gMG .
The extent and duration of the pharmacodynamic response in patients with PNH , aHUS , and gMG were exposure - dependent for ULTOMIRIS .
Free C5 levels of < 0 . 5 mcg / mL were correlated with maximal intravascular hemolysis control and complete terminal complement inhibition in patients with PNH .
Complete terminal complement inhibition following initiation of ULTOMIRIS treatment led to normalization of serum LDH by week 4 in complement - inhibitor naïve patients with PNH , and maintained LDH normalization in patients previously treated with eculizumab with PNH [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Ravulizumab - cwvz pharmacokinetics increase proportionally over a dose range of 200 to 5400 mg .

Body weight was a clinically significant covariate on the pharmacokinetics of ravulizumab - cwvz .
Drug Interactions No drug - drug interaction studies have been performed .
Intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) and FcRn blocker treatment may interfere with the endosomal neonatal FcRn recycling mechanism of monoclonal antibodies such as ravulizumab and thereby decrease serum ravulizumab concentrations [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 , 7 . 2 ) ] .
Concomitant PE , PP , or IVIg treatment requires a supplemental dose of ULTOMIRIS [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term animal carcinogenicity studies of ravulizumab - cwvz have not been conducted .
Genotoxicity studies have not been conducted with ravulizumab - cwvz .
Effects of ravulizumab - cwvz upon fertility have not been studied in animals .
Intravenous injections of male and female mice with a murine anti - C5 antibody at up to 0 . 8 - 2 . 2 times the equivalent of the clinical dose of ULTOMIRIS had no adverse effects on mating or fertility .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) The safety and efficacy of ULTOMIRIS in adult patients with PNH was assessed in two open - label , randomized , active - controlled , non - inferiority Phase 3 studies : PNH Study 301 and PNH Study 302 .
Study 301 enrolled patients with PNH who were complement inhibitor naïve and had active hemolysis .
Study 302 enrolled patients with PNH who were clinically stable after having been treated with eculizumab for at least the past 6 months .
The safety and efficacy of ULTOMIRIS in pediatric patients with PNH was assessed in PNH Study 304 , open - label , Phase 3 study conducted in eculizumab - experienced and complement inhibitor treatment naïve pediatric patients with PNH .
In both adult studies , ULTOMIRIS was dosed intravenously in accordance with the weight - based dosing described in Section 2 . 2 ( 4 infusions of ULTOMIRIS over 26 weeks ) above .
Eculizumab was administered on Days 1 , 8 , 15 , and 22 , followed by maintenance treatment with 900 mg of eculizumab on Day 29 and every 2 weeks ( q2w ) thereafter for a total of 26 weeks of treatment , according to the approved dosing regimen of eculizumab which was the standard - of - care for PNH at the time of the studies .
Patients were vaccinated against meningococcal infection prior to or at the time of initiating treatment with ULTOMIRIS or eculizumab , or received prophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination .
Prophylactic treatment with appropriate antibiotics beyond 2 weeks after vaccination was at the discretion of the provider .
Study in Complement - Inhibitor Naïve Adult Patients with PNH The Complement - Inhibitor Naïve Study [ ALXN1210 - PNH - 301 ; NCT02946463 ] was a 26 - week , multicenter , open - label , randomized , active - controlled , non - inferiority Phase 3 study conducted in 246 patients naïve to complement inhibitor treatment prior to study entry .

For patients who entered the study on eculizumab therapy , Day 1 of study treatment was planned to occur 2 weeks from the patient ' s last dose of eculizumab .
The weight - based dose regimen of ravulizumab - cwvz provided inhibition of terminal complement in all patients throughout the entire 26 - week treatment period regardless of prior experience with eculizumab .
Following initiation of ravulizumab - cwvz treatment , steady - state therapeutic serum concentrations of ravulizumab - cwvz were achieved after the first dose and maintained throughout the primary evaluation period in both cohorts .
Three of 5 complement inhibitor treatment - naïve patients and 6 out of 8 eculizumab - experienced patients achieved hemoglobin stabilization by Week 26 , respectively .
Transfusion avoidance was reached for 11 out of 13 of patients during the 26 - week Primary Evaluation Period .
One patient experienced breakthrough hemolysis during the extension period .

[ 3 ] No patients experienced breakthrough hemolysis during the primary evaluation period .
One patient experienced breakthrough hemolysis at 1 . 8 years during the extension period ; however , at the time of the BTH event the patient had adequate C5 inhibition ( free C5 < 0 . 5 µg / mL ) .
A clinically relevant improvement from baseline in fatigue as assessed by Pediatric FACIT - Fatigue ( i . e . , mean improvement of > 3 units for Pediatric FACIT Fatigue scores ) was sustained throughout the primary evaluation period in the 5 - complement inhibitor treatment naïve patients .
A slight improvement was also observed in eculizumab - experienced patients .
However , patient - reported fatigue may be an under - or over - estimation , because patients were not blinded to treatment assignment .
The efficacy of ULTOMIRIS in pediatric patients with PNH is similar to that observed in adult patients with PNH enrolled in pivotal studies .
14 . 2 Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome ( aHUS ) The efficacy of ULTOMIRIS in patients with aHUS was assessed in 2 open - label , single - arm studies .
Study ALXN1210 - aHUS - 311 enrolled adult patients who displayed signs of TMA .
In order to qualify for enrollment , patients were required to have a platelet count ≤ 150 × 109 / L , evidence of hemolysis such as an elevation in serum LDH , and serum creatinine above the upper limits of normal or required dialysis .
Study ALXN1210 - aHUS - 312 enrolled pediatric patients who displayed signs of TMA .
In order to qualify for enrollment , patients were required to have a platelet count ≤ 150 × 109 / L , evidence of hemolysis such as an elevation in serum LDH , and serum creatinine level ≥ 97 . 5 % percentile at screening or required dialysis .
In both studies , enrollment criteria excluded patients presenting with TMA due to a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif , member 13 ( ADAMTS13 ) deficiency , Shiga toxin Escherichia coli related hemolytic uremic syndrome ( STEC - HUS ) and genetic defect in cobalamin C metabolism .
Patients with confirmed diagnosis of STEC - HUS after enrollment were excluded from the efficacy evaluation .
Study in Adult Patients with aHUS The adult study [ ALXN1210 - aHUS - 311 ; NCT02949128 ] was conducted in patients who were naïve to complement inhibitor treatment prior to study entry .
The study consisted of a 26 - week Initial Evaluation Period and patients were allowed to enter an extension period for up to 4 . 5 years .
A total of 56 patients with aHUS were evaluated for efficacy .
Ninety - three percent of patients had extra - renal signs ( cardiovascular , pulmonary , central nervous system , gastrointestinal , skin , skeletal muscle ) or symptoms of aHUS at baseline .
At baseline , 71 . 4 % ( n = 40 ) of patients had Stage 5 chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) .
Fourteen percent had a medical history of kidney transplant and 51 . 8 % were on dialysis at study entry .
Eight patients entered the study with evidence of TMA for > 3 days after childbirth ( ie , postpartum ) .

All responses were maintained through all available follow - up .
Other endpoints included platelet count change from baseline , dialysis requirement , and renal function as evaluated by eGFR .
An increase in mean platelet count was observed after commencement of ULTOMIRIS , increasing from 60 . 50 × 109 / L at baseline to 296 . 67 × 109 / L at Day 8 and remained above 296 × 109 / L at all subsequent visits in the Initial Evaluation Period ( 26 weeks ) .
The mean eGFR ( + / - SD ) increased from 28 . 4 ( 23 . 11 ) at baseline to 108 . 0 ( 63 . 21 ) by 26 weeks .
Four of the 5 patients who required dialysis at study entry were able to discontinue dialysis after the first month in study and for the duration of ULTOMIRIS treatment .
No patient started dialysis during the study .
14 . 3 Generalized Myasthenia Gravis ( gMG ) The efficacy of ULTOMIRIS for the treatment of gMG was demonstrated in a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , multicenter study ( ALXN1210 - MG - 306 ; NCT03920293 ) .
Patients were randomized 1 : 1 to either receive ULTOMIRIS ( n = 86 ) or placebo ( n = 89 ) for 26 weeks .
ULTOMIRIS was administered intravenously according to the weight - based recommended dosage [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Patients with gMG with a positive serologic test for anti - AChR antibodies , Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America ( MGFA ) clinical classification class II to IV , and Myasthenia Gravis - Activities of Daily Living ( MG - ADL ) total score ≥ 6 were enrolled .
Baseline and disease characteristics were similar between treatment groups ( including age at first dose [ mean of 58 years for ULTOMIRIS versus 53 years for placebo ] , gender [ 51 % female for ULTOMIRIS versus 51 % female for placebo ] , race as White , Asian , and Black or African American [ 78 % , 17 % , and 2 % for ULTOMIRIS versus 69 % , 18 % , and 5 % for placebo , respectively ] , and duration of MG since diagnosis [ mean of 10 years , ranging from 0 . 5 to 39 . 5 years , for ULTOMIRIS versus mean of 10 . 0 years , ranging from 0 . 5 to 36 . 1 years , for placebo ] .
Over 80 % of patients were receiving acetylcholinesterase inhibitors , 70 % were receiving corticosteroids , and 68 % were receiving non - steroidal immunosuppressants ( ISTs ) at study entry .
Patients on concomitant medications to treat gMG were permitted to continue on therapy throughout the course of the study .
The primary efficacy endpoint was a comparison of the change from baseline between treatment groups in the MG - ADL total score at Week 26 .
The MG - ADL is a categorical scale that assesses the impact on daily function of 8 signs or symptoms that are typically affected in gMG .
Each item is assessed on a 4 - point scale where a score of 0 represents normal function and a score of 3 represents loss of ability to perform that function .
The total score ranges from 0 to 24 , with the higher scores indicating more impairment .
The secondary endpoints , also assessed from baseline to Week 26 , included the change in the Quantitative MG total score ( QMG ) .
The QMG is a 13 - item categorical scale assessing muscle weakness .
Each item is assessed on a 4 - point scale where a score of 0 represents no weakness and a score of 3 represents severe weakness .
A total score ranges from 0 to 39 , where higher scores indicate more severe impairment .
Other secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with improvements of at least 5 and 3 points in the QMG and MG - ADL total scores , respectively .
Treatment with ULTOMIRIS demonstrated a statistically significant change in the MG - ADL and QMG total scores from baseline at Week 26 as compared to placebo ( Table 29 ) .
