WARNING : CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS , BREAST CANCER , ENDOMETRIAL CANCER AND PROBABLE DEMENTIA Estrogen Plus Progestin Therapy Cardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia Estrogen plus progestin therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 , 14 . 6 ) ] .
The Women ’ s Health Initiative ( WHI ) estrogen plus progestin substudy reported increased risks of deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , stroke and myocardial infarction ( MI ) in postmenopausal women ( 50 to 79 years of age ) during 5 . 6 years of treatment with daily oral conjugated estrogen ( CE ) [ 0 . 625 mg ] combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA ) [ 2 . 5 mg ] , relative to placebo [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 ) ] .
The WHI Memory Study ( WHIMS ) estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of the WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 4 years of treatment with daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) combined with MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) , relative to placebo .
It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 6 ) ] .
Breast Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy also demonstrated an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 ) ] .
In the absence of comparable data , these risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of CE and MPA and other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins .
Estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman .
Estrogen - Alone Therapy Endometrial Cancer There is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens .
Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia , which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer .
Adequate diagnostic measures , including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated , should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Cardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia Estrogen - alone therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 , 14 . 6 ) ] .
The WHI estrogen - alone substudy reported increased risks of stroke and DVT in postmenopausal women ( 50 to 79 years of age ) during 7 . 1 years of treatment with daily oral CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone , relative to placebo [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 ) ] .
The WHIMS estrogen - alone ancillary study of the WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 5 . 2 years of treatment with daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone , relative to placebo .
It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 6 ) ] .
In the absence of comparable data , these risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of CE and other dosage forms of estrogens .
Estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment .

An increased risk of stroke and DVT has been reported with estrogen - alone therapy .
Should any of these occur or be suspected , estrogen with or without progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately .
Risk factors for arterial vascular disease ( for example , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , tobacco use , hypercholesterolemia , and obesity ) and / or venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) ( for example , personal history or family history of VTE , obesity , and systemic lupus erythematosus ) should be managed appropriately .
Stroke In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy , a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo ( 33 versus 25 per 10 , 000 women - years ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 ) ] .
The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted . 1 Should a stroke occur or be suspected , estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately .
In the WHI estrogen - alone substudy , a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo ( 45 versus 33 per 10 , 000 women - years ) .
The increase in risk was demonstrated in year 1 and persisted [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 ) ] .
Should a stroke occur or be suspected , estrogen - alone therapy should be discontinued immediately .
Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone versus those receiving placebo ( 18 versus 21 per 10 , 000 women - years ) . 1 Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy , there was a statistically non - significant increase risk of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) events ( defined as nonfatal MI , silent MI , or CHD death ) reported in women receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) compared to women receiving placebo ( 41 versus 34 per 10 , 000 women - years ) .
1 An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1 , and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 ) ] .
In the WHI estrogen - alone substudy , no overall effect on CHD events was reported in women receiving estrogen - alone compared to placebo 2 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 ) ] .
Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest a statistically non - significant reduction in CHD events ( CE [ 0 . 625 mg ] - alone compared to placebo ) in women with less than 10 years since menopause ( 8 versus 16 per 10 , 000 women - years ) . 1 In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease ( n = 2 , 763 ) , average 66 . 7 years of age , in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease ( Heart and Estrogen / Progestin Replacement Study [ HERS ] ) , treatment with daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit .
During an average follow - up of 4 . 1 years , treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established CHD .
There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA - treated group than in the placebo group in year 1 , but not during the subsequent years .
Two thousand , three hundred and twenty ‑ one ( 2 , 321 ) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open label extension of HERS , HERS II .
Average follow - up in HERS II was an additional 2 . 7 years , for a total of 6 . 8 years overall .
Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS , HERS II , and overall .
Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy , a statistically significant 2 - fold greater rate of VTE ( DVT and PE ) , was reported in women receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) compared to women receiving placebo ( 35 versus 17 per 10 , 000 women - years ) .
Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT ( 26 versus 13 per 10 , 000 women - years ) and PE ( 18 versus 8 per 10 , 000 women - years ) were also demonstrated .
The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted 3 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 ) ] .
Should a VTE occur or be suspected , estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately .
In the WHI estrogen - alone substudy , the risk of VTE was increased for women receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone compared to placebo ( 30 versus 22 per 10 , 000 women - years ) , although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance ( 23 versus 15 per 10 , 000 women - years ) .
The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first 2 years 4 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 ) ] .
Should a VTE occur or be suspected , estrogen - alone therapy should be discontinued immediately .
If feasible , estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism , or during periods of prolonged immobilization .
5 . 2 Malignant Neoplasms Breast Cancer The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the WHI substudy of daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) .
After a mean follow - up of 5 . 6 years , the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA .
In this substudy , prior use of estrogen - alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women .
The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1 . 24 , and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10 , 000 women - years , for CE plus MPA compared with placebo [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 ) ] .
Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy , the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1 . 86 , and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10 , 000 women - years , for CE plus MPA compared with placebo .
Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy , the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1 . 09 , and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10 , 000 women - years , for CE plus MPA compared with placebo .
In the same substudy , invasive breast cancers were larger , were more likely to be node positive , and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) group compared with the placebo group .
Metastatic disease was rare , with no apparent difference between the two groups .
Other prognostic factors , such as histologic subtype , grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups 5 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 ) ] .
The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen - alone users is the WHI substudy of daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone .
In the WHI estrogen - alone substudy , after an average follow ‑ up of 7 . 1 years , daily CE - alone was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [ relative risk ( RR ) 0 . 80 6 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 ) ] .
Consistent with the WHI clinical trials , observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy , and a smaller increased risk for estrogen - alone therapy , after several years of use .
The risk increased with duration of use , and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment ( only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping ) .
Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater , and became apparent earlier , with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen - alone therapy .
However , these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations , doses , or routes of administration .
The use of estrogen - alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation .
In a one - year trial among 1 , 176 women who received either unopposed 1 mg estradiol or a combination of 1 mg estradiol plus one of three different doses of NETA ( 0 . 1 , 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 mg ) , seven new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed , two of which occurred among the group of 295 women treated with Lopreeza 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg and two of which occurred among the group of 294 women treated with 1 mg estradiol / 0 . 1 mg NETA .
All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self - examinations .
In addition , mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age , risk factors , and prior mammogram results .
Endometrial Cancer Endometrial hyperplasia ( a possible precursor of endometrial cancer ) has been reported to occur at a rate of approximately 1 percent or less with Lopreeza .
An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus .
The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in nonusers , and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose .
Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than 1 year .
The greatest risk appears to be associated with prolonged use , with increased risks of 15 - to 24 ‑ fold for 5 to 10 years or more .
This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued .
Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen - alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy is important .
Adequate diagnostic measures , including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated , should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding .
There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose .
Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia , which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer .
Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non - significant increased risk of ovarian cancer .
After an average follow - up of 5 . 6 years , the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1 . 58 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 77 - 3 . 24 ] .
The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10 , 000 women - years . 7 A meta - analysis of 17 prospective and 35 retrospective epidemiology studies found that women who used hormonal therapy for menopausal symptoms had an increased risk for ovarian cancer .
The primary analysis , using case - control comparisons , included 12 , 110 cancer cases from the 17 prospective studies .
The relative risks associated with current use of hormonal therapy was 1 . 41 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 1 . 32 to 1 . 50 ) ; there was no difference in the risk estimates by duration of the exposure ( less than 5 years [ median of 3 years ] vs . greater than 5 years [ median of 10 years ] of use before the cancer diagnosis ) .
The relative risk associated with combined current and recent use ( discontinued use within 5 years before cancer diagnosis ) was 1 . 37 ( 95 % CI 1 . 27 - 1 . 48 ) , and the elevated risk was significant for both estrogen - alone and estrogen plus progestin products .
The exact duration of hormone therapy use associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer , however , is unknown .
5 . 3 Probable Dementia In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI , a population of 4 , 532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) or placebo .
After an average follow - up of 4 years , 40 women in the CE plus MPA and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia .
The relative risk of probable dementia for the CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2 . 05 ( 95 percent CI , 1 . 21 - 3 . 48 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10 , 000 women - years 8 [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 6 ) ] .
In the WHIMS estrogen - alone ancillary study of WHI , a population of 2 , 947 hysterectomized women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone or placebo .
After an average follow - up of 5 . 2 years , 28 women in the estrogen - alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia .
The relative risk of probable dementia for CE - alone versus placebo was 1 . 49 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 83 - 2 . 66 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE - alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10 , 000 women - years 8 [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 6 ) ] .
When data from the two populations in the WHIMS estrogen - alone and estrogen plus progestin ancillary studies were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol , the reported overall relative risk of probable dementia was 1 . 76 ( 95 percent CI , 1 . 19 - 2 . 60 ) .
Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age , it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women 8 [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 6 ) ] .
5 . 4 Gallbladder Disease A 2 - to 4 - fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported .
5 . 5 Hypercalcemia Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases .
If hypercalcemia occurs , use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level .
5 . 6 Vision Abnormalities Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogens .
Discontinue medication pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision , or a sudden onset of proptosis , diplopia , or migraine .
If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions , estrogens should be permanently discontinued .
5 . 7 Addition of a Progestin When a Woman Has Not Had a Hysterectomy Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration , or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen , have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone .
Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer .
There are , however , possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen - alone regimens .
These include an increased risk of breast cancer .
5 . 8 Elevated Blood Pressure In a small number of case reports , substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens .
In a large , randomized , placebo - controlled clinical trial , a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen .
5 . 9 Hypertriglyceridemia In women with pre - existing hypertriglyceridemia , estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis .
Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs .
5 . 10 Hepatic Impairment and / or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with impaired liver function .
For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy , caution should be exercised , and in the case of recurrence , medication should be discontinued .
5 . 11 Hypothyroidism Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid - binding globulin ( TBG ) levels .
Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone , thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range .
Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogen may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy .
These women should have their thyroid function monitored to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range .
5 . 12 Fluid Retention Estrogens plus progestins may cause some degree of fluid retention .
Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor , such as a cardiac or renal impairment , warrant careful observation when estrogens plus progestins are prescribed .
5 . 13 Hypocalcemia Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen - induced hypocalcemia may occur .
5 . 14 Exacerbation of Endometriosis A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post - hysterectomy with estrogen - alone therapy .
For women known to have residual endometriosis post - hysterectomy , the addition of progestin should be considered .
5 . 15 Hereditary Angioedema Exogenous estrogens may exacerbate symptoms of angioedema in women with hereditary angioedema .
5 . 16 Exacerbation of Other Conditions Estrogen therapy may cause an exacerbation of asthma , diabetes mellitus , epilepsy , migraine , porphyria , systemic lupus erythematosus , and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions .
5 . 17 Laboratory Tests Serum follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and estradiol levels have not been shown to be useful in the management of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy .
5 . 18 Drug - Laboratory Test Interactions Accelerated prothrombin time , partial thromboplastin time , and platelet aggregation time ; increased platelet count ; increased factors II , VII antigen , VIII coagulant activity , IX , X , XII , VII - X complex , and beta - thromboglobulin ; decreased levels of anti - factor Xa and antithrombin III , decreased antithrombin III activity , increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity ; increased plasminogen antigen and activity .
Increased TBG levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein - bound iodine ( PBI ) , T4 levels ( by column or by radioimmunoassay ) , or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay .
T3 resin uptake is decreased , reflecting the elevated TBG .
Free T4 and freeT3 concentrations are unaltered .
Women on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone .
Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum , for example , corticosteroid binding globulin ( CBG ) , sex hormone - binding globulin ( SHBG ) , leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids , respectively .
Free hormone concentrations , such as testosterone and estradiol , may be decreased .
Other plasma proteins may be increased ( angiotensinogen / rennin substrate , alpha - 1 antitrypsin , ceruloplasmin ) .
Increased plasma high - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentration , reduced low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol concentration , increased triglyceride levels .
Impaired glucose tolerance .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Coadministration of estradiol with norethindrone acetate did not elicit any apparent influence on the pharmacokinetics of norethindrone acetate .
Similarly , no relevant interaction of norethindrone acetate on the pharmacokinetics of estradiol was found within the NETA dose range investigated in a single dose study .
• Inducers and / or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism ( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Metabolic Interactions Estradiol In - vitro and in - vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) .
Therefore , inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism .
Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St . John ’ s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) preparations , phenobarbital , carbamazepine , and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens , possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and / or changes in the uterine bleeding profile .
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin , clarithromycin , ketoconazole , itraconazole , ritonavir and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and result in side effects .
Norethindrone Acetate Drugs or herbal products that induce or inhibit cytochrome P - 450 enzymes , including CYP3A4 , may decrease or increase the serum concentrations of norethindrone .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Nursing Mothers : Estrogen administration to nursing women has been shown to decrease the quantity and quality of breast milk ( 8 . 3 ) • Geriatric Use : An increase risk of probable dementia in women over 65 years of age was reported in the Women ’ s Health Initiative Memory ancillary studies of the Women ’ s Health Initiative ( 5 . 3 , 8 . 5 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Lopreeza should not be used during pregnancy [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
There appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in children born to women who have used estrogens and progestins as an oral contraceptive inadvertently during early pregnancy .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Lopreeza should not be used during lactation .
Estrogen administration to nursing women has been shown to decrease the quantity and quality of the breast milk .
Detectable amounts of estrogen and progestin have been identified in the breast milk of women receiving estrogen plus progestin therapy .
Caution should be exercised when Lopreeza is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Lopreeza is not indicated in children .
Clinical studies have not been conducted in the pediatric population .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use There have not been sufficient numbers of geriatric women involved in clinical studies utilizing Lopreeza to determine whether those over 65 years of age differ from younger subjects in their response to Lopreeza .
The Women ’ s Health Initiative Studies In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy ( daily CE [ 0 . 625 mg ] plus MPA [ 2 . 5 mg ] versus placebo ) , there was a higher relative risk of nonfatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women greater than 65 years of age [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 ) ] .
In the WHI estrogen - alone substudy ( daily CE [ 0 . 625 mg ] - alone versus placebo ) , there was a higher relative risk of stroke in women greater than 65 years of age [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 ) ] .
The Women ’ s Health Initiative Memory Study In the WHIMS ancillary studies of postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age , there was an increased risk of developing probable dementia in women receiving estrogen plus progestin or estrogen - alone when compared to placebo .
It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 6 ) ] .
Since both ancillary studies were conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age , it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women 8 [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 6 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Lopreeza has not been studied .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Lopreeza has not been studied .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage of estrogen plus progestin may cause nausea , vomiting , breast tenderness , abdominal pain , drowsiness and fatigue , and withdrawal bleeding may occur in women .
Treatment of overdose consists of discontinuation of Lopreeza therapy with institution of appropriate symptomatic care .

The structural formula of NETA is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Norethindrone Acetate [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics .
Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions , estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites , estrone and estriol , at the receptor level .
The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle , which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily , depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle .
After menopause , most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione , secreted by the adrenal cortex , to estrone in the peripheral tissues .
Thus , estrone and the sulfate - conjugated form , estrone sulfate , are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women .
Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen - responsive tissues .
To date , two estrogen receptors have been identified .
These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue .
Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , and FSH through a negative feedback mechanism .
Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women .
Progestin compounds enhance cellular differentiation and generally oppose the actions of estrogens by decreasing estrogen receptor levels , increasing local metabolism of estrogens to less active metabolites , or inducing gene products that blunt cellular responses to estrogen .
Progestins exert their effects in target cells by binding to specific progesterone receptors that interact with progesterone response elements in target genes .
Progesterone receptors have been identified in the female reproductive tract , breast , pituitary , hypothalamus , and central nervous system .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics There are no pharmacodynamic data known for Lopreeza tablets .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Estradiol Estradiol is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract .
Following oral administration of Lopreeza tablets , peak plasma estradiol concentrations are reached within 5 to 8 hours .
The oral bioavailability of estradiol following administration of Lopreeza 1 mg / 0 . 5 mg when compared to a combination oral solution is 53 % .
Administration of Lopreeza 1 mg / 0 . 5 mg with food did not modify the bioavailability of estradiol .
Norethindrone Acetate After oral administration , norethindrone acetate is absorbed and transformed to norethindrone .
Norethindrone reaches a peak plasma concentration within 0 . 5 to 1 . 5 hours after the administration of Lopreeza tablets .
The oral bioavailability of norethindrone following administration of Lopreeza 1 mg / 0 . 5 mg when compared to a combination oral solution is 100 % .
Administration of Lopreeza 1 mg / 0 . 5 mg with food increases norethindrone AUC0 - 72 by 19 % and decreases Cmax by 36 % .
The pharmacokinetic parameters of estradiol ( E2 ) , estrone ( E1 ) , and norethindrone ( NET ) following oral administration of 1 Lopreeza 1 mg / 0 . 5 mg or 2 Lopreeza 0 . 5 mg / 0 . 1 mg tablet ( s ) to healthy postmenopausal women are summarized in Table 3 .

Unadjusted circulating concentrations of E2 , E1 , and NET during Lopreeza 1 mg / 0 . 5 mg treatment at steady state ( dosing at time 0 ) are provided in Figures 1 a and 1 b .
Figure 1 a : Mean Baseline - Uncorrected Estradiol and Estrone Serum Concentration - Time Profiles Following Multiple Doses of Lopreeza 1 mg / 0 . 5 mg ( N = 24 ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 1 b : Mean Baseline - Uncorrected Norethindrone Serum Concentration - Time Profile Following Multiple Doses of Lopreeza 1 mg / 0 . 5 mg ( N = 24 ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] Distribution Estradiol The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens .
Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs .
Estradiol circulates in the blood bound to SHBG ( 37 % ) and to albumin ( 61 % ) , while only approximately 1 to 2 % is unbound .
Norethindrone Acetate Norethindrone also binds to a similar extent to SHBG ( 36 % ) and to albumin ( 61 % ) .
Metabolism Estradiol Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens .
Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions .
These transformations take place mainly in the liver .
Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone , and both can be converted to estriol , which is a major urinary metabolite .
Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver , biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine , and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption .
In postmenopausal women , a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates , especially estrone sulfate , which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens .
Norethindrone Acetate The most important metabolites of norethindrone are isomers of 5α - dihydro - norethindrone and tetrahydro - norethindrone , which are excreted mainly in the urine as sulfate or glucuronide conjugates .
Excretion Estradiol Estradiol , estrone , and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates .
The half - life of estradiol following single dose administration of Lopreeza 1 mg / 0 . 5 mg is 12 to 14 hours .
Norethindrone Acetate The terminal half - life of norethindrone is about 8 to 11 hours .
Use in Specific Populations No pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in specific populations , including women with renal or hepatic impairment .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast , uterus , cervix , vagina , testis , and liver .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Effects on Vasomotor Symptoms In a 12 - week randomized clinical trial involving 92 subjects , Lopreeza 1 mg / 0 . 5 mg was compared to 1 mg of estradiol and to placebo .
The mean number and intensity of hot flushes were significantly reduced from baseline to week 4 and 12 in both the Lopreeza 1 mg / 0 . 5 mg and the 1 mg estradiol group compared to placebo ( see Figure 2 ) .
Figure 2 Mean Weekly Number of Moderate and Severe Hot Flushes in a 12 - Week Study [ MULTIMEDIA ] In a study conducted in Europe a total of 577 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to either Lopreeza 0 . 5 mg / 0 . 1 mg , 0 . 5 mg E2 / 0 . 25 mg NETA , or placebo for 24 weeks of treatment .
The mean number and severity of hot flushes were significantly reduced at week 4 and week 12 in the Lopreeza 0 . 5 mg / 0 . 1 mg ( see Figure 3 ) and 0 . 5 mg E2 / 0 . 25 mg NETA groups compared to placebo .
Figure 3 Mean Number of Moderate to Severe Hot Flushes for Weeks 0 Through 12 [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Effects on the Endometrium Lopreeza 1 mg / 0 . 5 mg reduced the incidence of estrogen - induced endometrial hyperplasia at 1 year in a randomized , controlled clinical trial .
This trial enrolled 1 , 176 subjects who were randomized to one of 4 arms : 1 mg estradiol unopposed ( n = 296 ) , 1 mg E2 + 0 . 1 mg NETA ( n = 294 ) , 1 mg E2 + 0 . 25 mg NETA ( n = 291 ) , and Lopreeza 1 mg / 0 . 5 mg ( n = 295 ) .
At the end of the study , endometrial biopsy results were available for 988 subjects .
The results of the 1 mg estradiol unopposed arm compared to Lopreeza 1 mg / 0 . 5 mg are shown in Table 4 .

A total of 462 postmenopausal women with intact uteri and baseline BMD values for lumbar spine within 2 standard deviations of the mean in healthy young women ( T - score > - 2 . 0 ) were enrolled .
In a US trial , 327 postmenopausal women ( mean time from menopause 2 . 5 to 3 . 1 years ) with a mean age of 53 years were randomized to 7 groups ( 0 . 25 mg , 0 . 5 mg , and 1 mg of estradiol alone , 1 mg estradiol with 0 . 25 mg norethindrone acetate , 1 mg estradiol with 0 . 5 mg norethindrone acetate , and 2 mg estradiol with 1 mg norethindrone acetate , and placebo . )
In a European trial ( EU trial ) , 135 postmenopausal women ( mean time from menopause 8 . 4 to 9 . 3 years ) with a mean age of 58 years were randomized to 1 mg estradiolwith 0 . 25 mg norethindrone acetate , 1 mg estradiol with 0 . 5 mg norethindrone acetate , andplacebo .
Approximately 58 percent and 67 percent of the randomized subjects in the two clinical trials , respectively , completed the two clinical trials .
BMD was measured using dual - energy x - ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) .
A summary of the results comparing Lopreeza 1 mg / 0 . 5 mg and estradiol 0 . 5 mg to placebo from the two prevention trials is shown in Table 5 .

* Significantly ( p < 0 . 001 ) different from placebo ** Significantly ( p < 0 . 007 ) different from placebo *** Significantly ( p < 0 . 002 ) different from placebo The overall difference in mean percentage change in BMD at the lumbar spine in the US trial ( 1000 mg per day calcium ) between Lopreeza 1 mg / 0 . 5 mg and placebo was 5 . 9 percent and between estradiol 0 . 5 mg and placebo was 4 . 4 percent .
In the European trial ( 500 mg per day calcium ) , the overall difference in mean percentage change in BMD at the lumbar spine was 6 . 3 percent .
Lopreeza 1 mg / 0 . 5 mg and estradiol 0 . 5 mg also increased BMD at the femoral neck and femoral trochanter compared to placebo .
The increase in lumbar spine BMD in the US and European clinical trials for Lopreeza 1 mg / 0 . 5 mg and estradiol 0 . 5 mg is displayed in Figure 6 .

The primary endpoint was the incidence of CHD ( defined as nonfatal MI , silent MI and CHD death ) , with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome .
A “ global index ” included the earliest occurrence of CHD , invasive breast cancer , stroke , PE , endometrial cancer ( only in the CE plus MPA substudy ) , colorectal cancer , hip fracture , or death due to other cause .
These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE plus MPA or CE - alone on menopausal symptoms .
WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early .
According to the predefined stopping rule , after an average follow - up of 5 . 6 years of treatment , the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the “ global index . ”
The absolute excess risk of events included in the “ global index ” was 19 per 10 , 000 women - years .
For those outcomes included in the WHI “ global index , ” that reached statistical significance after 5 . 6 years of follow - up , the absolute excess risks per 10 , 000 women - years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events , 8 more strokes , 10 more PEs , and 8 more invasive breast cancers , while the absolute risk reductions per 10 , 000 women - years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures .

For those outcomes included in the WHI “ global index ” that reached statistical significance , the absolute excess risk per 10 , 000 women - years in the group treated with CE - alone was 12 more strokes , while the absolute risk reduction per 10 , 000 women - years was 7 fewer hip fractures . 9 The absolute excess risk of events included in the “ global index ” was a non - significant 5 events per 10 , 000 women - years .
There was no difference between the groups in terms of all - cause mortality .
No overall difference for primary CHD events ( nonfatal MI , silent MI and CHD death ) and invasive breast cancer incidence in women receiving CE - alone compared with placebo was reported in final centrally adjudicated results from the estrogen - alone substudy , after an average follow up of 7 . 1 years .
Centrally adjudicated results for stroke events from the estrogen - alone substudy , after an average follow - up of 7 . 1 years , reported no significant difference in distribution of stroke subtype or severity , including fatal strokes , in women receiving CE - alone compared to placebo .
Estrogen - alone increased the risk for ischemic stroke , and this excess risk was present in all subgroups of women examined . 10 Timing of the initiation of estrogen - alone therapy relative to the start of menopause may affect the overall risk benefit profile .
The WHI estrogen - alone substudy , stratified by age , showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a non - significant trend toward reduced risk for CHD [ HR 0 . 63 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 36 - 1 . 09 ) ] and overall mortality [ HR 0 . 71 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 46 - 1 . 11 ) ] .
14 . 6 Women ’ s Health Initiative Memory Study The WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of WHI enrolled 4 , 532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older ( 47 percent were 65 to 69 years of age , 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age , 18 percent were 75 years of age and older ) to evaluate the effects of daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) on the incidence of probable dementia ( primary outcome ) compared to placebo .
After an average follow - up of 4 years , the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2 . 05 ( 95 percent CI , 1 . 21 - 3 . 48 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10 , 000 women - years .
Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer ’ s disease ( AD ) , vascular dementia ( VaD ) and mixed types ( having features of both AD and VaD ) .
The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD .
Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age , it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
The WHIMS estrogen - alone ancillary study of WHI study enrolled 2 , 947 predominantly healthy hysterectomized postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age ( 45 percent were 65 to 69 years of age , 36 percent were 70 to 74 years of age , 19 percent were 75 years of age and older ) to evaluate the effects of daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) - alone on the incidence of probable dementia ( primary outcome ) compared to placebo .
After an average follow - up of 5 . 2 years , the relative risk of probable dementia for CE - alone versus placebo was 1 . 49 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 83 - 2 . 66 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE - alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10 , 000 women - years .
Probable dementia as defined in this study included AD , VaD and mixed types ( having features of both AD and VaD ) .
The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD .
Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age , it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
When data from the two populations were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol , the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1 . 76 ( 95 percent CI , 1 . 19 - 2 . 60 ) .
Differences between groups became apparent in the first year of treatment .
It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .

There may be new information .
This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your menopausal symptoms or your treatment .
What is the most important information I should know about Lopreeza ( a combination of estrogen and progestin ) ?
• Do not use estrogens with progestins to prevent heart disease , heart attacks , strokes , or dementia ( decline of brain function ) .
• Taking estrogens with progestins may increase your chances of getting heart attacks , strokes , breast cancer , or blood clots .
• Taking estrogens with progestins may increase your chance of getting dementia , based on a study of women 65 years of age or older .
• Do not use estrogen - alone to prevent heart disease , heart attacks , strokes or dementia .
• Taking estrogen - alone may increase your chance of getting cancer of the uterus ( womb ) .
• Taking estrogen - alone may increase your chances of getting strokes or blood clots .
• Taking estrogen - alone may increase your chance of getting dementia , based on a study of women 65 years of age or older .
• You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with Lopreeza .
What is Lopreeza ?
Lopreeza is a prescription medicine that contains two kinds of hormones , an estrogen and a progestin .
What is Lopreeza used for ?
Lopreeza is used after menopause to : • reduce moderate to severe hot flushesEstrogens are hormones made by a woman ’ s ovaries .
The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 and 55 yrs old .
This drop in body estrogen levels causes the “ change of life ” or menopause , the end of monthly menstrual periods .
Sometimes both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place .
The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes “ surgical menopause . ”
When the estrogen levels begin dropping , some women get very uncomfortable symptoms , such as feelings of warmth in the face , neck , and chest , or sudden , intense episodes of heat and sweating ( “ hot flashes ” or “ hot flushes ” ) .
In some women , the symptoms are mild , and they will not need to take estrogens .
In other women , symptoms can be more severe .
You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether or not you still need treatment with Lopreeza .
• treat moderate to severe menopausal changes in and around the vagina You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with Lopreeza 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg to treat these problems .
If you use Lopreeza 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg only to treat your menopausal changes in and around your vagina , talk with your healthcare provider about whether a topical vaginal product would be better for you .
• help reduce your chances of getting osteoporosis ( thin weak bones ) If you use Lopreeza only to prevent osteoporosis from menopause , talk to your healthcare provider about whether a different treatment or medicine without estrogens might be better for you .
You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with Lopreeza .
Who should not take Lopreeza ?
Do not take Lopreeza if you have had your uterus ( womb ) removed ( hysterectomy ) .
Lopreeza contains a progestin to decrease the chance of getting cancer of the uterus .
If you do not have a uterus , you do not need a progestin and you should not take Lopreeza .
Do not take Lopreeza if you : • have unusual vaginal bleedingVaginal bleeding after menopause may be a warning sign of cancer of the uterus ( womb ) .
Your healthcare provider should check any unusual vaginal bleeding to find out the cause .
• currently have or have had certain cancers Estrogens may increase the chance of getting certain types of cancers , including cancer of the breast or uterus .
If you have or have had cancer , talk with your healthcare provider about whether you should take Lopreeza .
• had a stroke or heart attack • currently have or have had blood clots • currently have or have had liver problems • have been diagnosed with a bleeding disorder • are allergic to Lopreeza or any of its ingredients See the list of ingredients in Lopreeza at the end of this leaflet .
• think you may be pregnantLopreeza is not for pregnant women .
If you think you may be pregnant , you should have a pregnancy test and know the results .
Do not take Lopreeza if the test is positive and talk to your healthcare provider .
What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking Lopreeza ?
Before you take Lopreeza , tell your healthcare provider if you : • have any unusual vaginal bleedingVaginal bleeding after menopause may bea warning sign of cancer of the uterus ( womb ) .
Your healthcare provider should check any unusual vaginal bleeding to find out the cause .
• have any other medical conditionsYour healthcare provider may need to check you morecarefully if you have certain conditions , such as asthma ( wheezing ) , epilepsy ( seizures ) , diabetes , migraine , endometriosis , lupus , angioedema ( swelling of face and tongue ) , or problems with your heart , liver , thyroid , kidneys , or have high calcium levels in your blood .
