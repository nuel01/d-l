Injection , USP Rx only ADD - Vantage ™ Diluent Flexible Plastic Container DESCRIPTION Sodium Chloride Injection , USP solutions are sterile and nonpyrogenic .
They are parenteral solutions containing various concentrations of sodium chloride in water for injection intended for intravenous administration after admixing with an ADD - Vantage vial , or single - dose powdered drug vials with 20 mm closure using the ADD - Vantage ADDAPTOR ™ ( WARNING : DO NOT USE WITH CHEMOTHERAPY AGENTS ) .
Each 100 mL of 0 . 45 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP contains 450 mg sodium chloride in water for injection .
Electrolytes per 1000 mL : sodium 77 mEq ; chloride 77 mEq .
The osmolarity is 154 mOsmol / L ( calc . )
, which is hypotonic .
Each 100 mL of 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP contains 900 mg sodium chloride in water for injection .
Electrolytes per 1000 mL : sodium 154 mEq ; chloride 154 mEq .
The osmolarity is 308 mOsmol / L ( calc . )
, which is isotonic .
The pH for both concentrations is 5 . 6 ( 4 . 5 to 7 . 0 ) .
The solutions contain no bacteriostat , antimicrobial agent or added buffer and each is intended only as a single - dose injection .
When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded .
The solutions are parenteral fluid and electrolyte replenishers .
Sodium Chloride , USP is chemically designated NaCl , a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water .
Water for Injection , USP is chemically designated H2O .
The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinylchloride .
Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts ; however , biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials .
Exposure to temperatures above 25 ° C / 77 ° F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content .
Higher temperatures lead to greater losses .
It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When administered intravenously , these solutions provide a source of water and electrolytes .
Solutions which provide an isotonic concentration of sodium chloride are suitable for parenteral maintenance or replacement of water and electrolyte requirements .
Isotonic concentrations of sodium chloride are suitable for parenteral replacement of chloride losses that exceed or equal the sodium loss .
Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium ( Na + ) and chloride ( Cl ‾ ) ions .
Sodium ( Na + ) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances .
Chloride ( Cl ‾ ) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells .
The distribution and excretion of sodium ( Na + ) and chloride ( Cl ‾ ) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output .
Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70 % of total body weight .
Average normal adult daily requirements range from two to three liters ( 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production ) .
Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms .
Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium ( Na + ) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Intravenous solutions containing sodium chloride are indicated for parenteral replenishment of fluid and sodium chloride as required by the clinical condition of the patient .
In this dosage form , Sodium Chloride Injection , USP is intended to be used as a diluent for the contents of an ADD - Vantage vial , or single - dose vials with 20 mm closure using the ADD - Vantage ADDAPTOR ™ .
CONTRAINDICATIONS None known .
WARNINGS Solutions containing sodium ions should be used with great care , if at all , in patients with congestive heart failure , severe renal insufficiency and in clinical states in which there exists edema with sodium retention .
Excessive administration of potassium - free solutions may result in significant hypokalemia .
In patients with diminished renal function , administration of solutions containing sodium ions may result in sodium retention .
The intravenous administration of these solutions can cause fluid and / or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of administered parenteral solutions .
The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of such solutions .
PRECAUTIONS General Do not use plastic containers in series connections .
Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is completed .
Use of a vented intravenous administration set with the vent in the open position could result in air embolism .
Vented intravenous administration sets with the vent in the open position should not be used with flexible plastic containers .
Laboratory Tests Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance , electrolyte concentrations and acid - base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation .
DRUG INTERACTIONS Caution must be exercised in the administration of parenteral fluids , especially those containing sodium ions to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Studies with Sodium Chloride Injection , USP have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , mutagenic potential or effects on fertility .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic effects Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Sodium Chloride Injection , USP .
It is not known whether sodium chloride injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Sodium Chloride Injection , USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Labor and Delivery : Studies have not been conducted to evaluate the effects of Sodium Chloride Injection , USP on labor and delivery .
Caution should be exercised when administering this drug during labor and delivery .
Nursing Mothers : It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when Sodium Chloride Injection , USP is administered to a nursing mother .
Pediatric Use : Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established .
Geriatric Use : Clinical studies of Sodium Chloride Injection , USP did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or drug therapy .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged .
Discard unused portion .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response , infection at the site of injection , venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection , extravasation and hypervolemia .
If an adverse reaction does occur , discontinue the infusion , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of overhydration or solute overload , re - evaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective measures .
See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and ADVERSE REACTIONS .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dose is dependent upon the age , weight and clinical condition of the patient .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
See PRECAUTIONS .
