WARNING : LACTIC ACIDOSIS Postmarketing cases of metformin - associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death , hypothermia , hypotension , and resistant bradyarrhythmias .
The onset of metformin - associated lactic acidosis is often subtle , accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise , myalgias , respiratory distress , somnolence , and abdominal pain .
Metformin - associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels ( > 5 mmol / Liter ) , anion gap acidosis ( without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia ) , an increased lactate / pyruvate ratio ; and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg / mL .
Risk factors for metformin - associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment , concomitant use of certain drugs ( e . g . carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate ) , age 65 years old or greater , having a radiological study with contrast , surgery and other procedures , hypoxic states ( e . g . , acute congestive heart failure ) , excessive alcohol intake , and hepatic impairment .
Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin - associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided .
If metformin - associated lactic acidosis is suspected , immediately discontinue metformin hydrochloride and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting .
Prompt hemodialysis is recommended .
Lactic Acidosis There have been postmarketing cases of metformin - associated lactic acidosis , including fatal cases .
These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise , myalgias , abdominal pain , respiratory distress , or increased somnolence ; however , hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis .
Metformin - associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations ( > 5 mmol / L ) , anion gap acidosis ( without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia ) , and an increased lactate : pyruvate ratio ; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg / mL .
Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis , especially in patients at risk .
If metformin - associated lactic acidosis is suspected , general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting , along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride .
In metformin hydrochloride treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis , prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin ( metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL / min under good hemodynamic conditions ) .
Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery .
Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and , if these symptoms occur , instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider .
For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin - associated lactic acidosis , recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin - associated lactic acidosis are provided below : Renal impairment — The postmarketing metformin - associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment .
The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin - associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney .
Clinical recommendations based upon the patient ’ s renal function include : • Before initiating metformin hydrochloride , obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) .
• Metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ] .
• Initiation of metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 .
• Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride .
In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment ( e . g . , the elderly ) , renal function should be assessed more frequently .
• In patients taking metformin hydrochloride whose eGFR falls below 45 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 , assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy .
Drug interactions — The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin - associated lactic acidosis : those that impair renal function , result in significant hemodynamic change , interfere with acid - base balance , or increase metformin accumulation .
Consider more frequent monitoring of patients .
Age 65 or greater — The risk of metformin - associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient ’ s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic , renal , or cardiac impairment than younger patients .
Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients .
Radiologic studies with contrast — Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin - treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis .
Stop metformin hydrochloride at the time of , or prior to , an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment , alcoholism or heart failure ; or in patients who will be administered intra - arterial iodinated contrast .
Re - evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure , and restart metformin hydrochloride if renal function is stable .
Surgery and other procedures — Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion , hypotension , and renal impairment .
metformin hydrochloride should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake .
Hypoxic states — Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin - associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure ( particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia ) .
Cardiovascular collapse ( shock ) , acute myocardial infarction , sepsis , and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia .
When such an event occurs , discontinue metformin hydrochloride .
Excessive alcohol intake — Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism .
Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride .
Hepatic impairment — Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin - associated lactic acidosis .
This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels .
Therefore , avoid use of metformin hydrochloride in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease .
Vitamin B12 Deficiency In Metformin hydrochloride clinical trials of 29 - week duration , a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7 % of patients .
Such decrease , possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12 - intrinsic factor complex , may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride or vitamin B12 supplementation .
Certain individuals ( those with inadequate vitamin B12 or calcium intake or absorption ) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B12 levels .
Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride and manage any abnormalities [ see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues ( e . g . , sulfonylurea ) are known to cause hypoglycemia .
Metformin hydrochloride may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and / or an insulin secretagogue .
Therefore , a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride [ see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7 ) ] .
Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride .
Metformin hydrochloride tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients 10 years of age and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
Adult Dosage The recommended starting dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets is 500 mg orally twice a day or 850 mg once a day , given with meals .
Increase the dose in increments of 500 mg weekly or 850 mg every 2 weeks on the basis of glycemic control and tolerability , up to a maximum dose of 2550 mg per day , given in divided doses .
Doses above 2000 mg may be better tolerated given 3 times a day with meals .
Pediatric Dosage for Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets The recommended starting dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets for pediatric patients 10 years of age and older is 500 mg orally twice a day , given with meals .
Increase dosage in increments of 500 mg weekly on the basis of glycemic control and tolerability , up to a maximum of 2000 mg per day , given in divided doses twice daily .
Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets and periodically thereafter .
Metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) below 30 mL / minute / 1 . 73 m2 .
Initiation of metformin hydrochloride tablets in patients with an eGFR between 30 to 45 mL / minute / 1 . 73 m2 is not recommended .
In patients taking metformin hydrochloride tablets whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 , assess the benefit risk of continuing therapy .
Discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets if the patient ’ s eGFR later falls below 30 mL / minute / 1 . 73 m2 .
Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures Discontinue metformin hydrochloride tablets at the time of , or prior to , an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ; in patients with a history of liver disease , alcoholism , or heart failure ; or in patients who will be administered intra - arterial iodinated contrast .
Re - evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure ; restart metformin hydrochloride tablets if renal function is stable .
Metformin Hydrochloride Tablets USP , 500 mg : White , biconvex , circular shaped film coated tablets with ‘ A ’ debossed on one side and ‘ 12 ’ debossed on the other side .
Metformin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients with : • Severe renal impairment ( eGFR below 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) .
• Hypersensitivity to metformin .
• Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis , including diabetic ketoacidosis , with or without coma .
The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling : • Lactic Acidosis [ see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ] • Vitamin B12 Deficiency [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ] • Hypoglycemia [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ] Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In a U . S . clinical trial of metformin hydrochloride in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus , a total of 141 patients received metformin hydrochloride up to 2550 mg per day .
Adverse reactions reported in greater than 5 % of metformin hydrochloride treated patients and that were more common than in placebo - treated patients , are listed in Table 1 .
Table 1 : Adverse Reactions from a Clinical Trial of Metformin Hydrochloride Occurring > 5 % and More Common than Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Metformin Hydrochloride ( n = 141 ) Placebo ( n = 145 ) Diarrhea 53 % 12 % Nausea / Vomiting 26 % 8 % Flatulence 12 % 6 % Asthenia 9 % 6 % Indigestion 7 % 4 % Abnormal Discomfort 6 % 5 % Headache 6 % 5 % Diarrhea led to discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride in 6 % of patients .
Additionally , the following adverse reactions were reported in 1 % to 5 % of metformin hydrochloride treated patients and were more commonly reported with metformin hydrochloride than placebo : abnormal stools , hypoglycemia , myalgia , lightheaded , dyspnea , nail disorder , rash , sweating increased , taste disorder , chest discomfort , chills , flu syndrome , flushing , palpitation .
In metformin hydrochloride clinical trials of 29 - week duration , a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B12 levels was observed in approximately 7 % of patients .
Pediatric Patients In clinical trials with metformin hydrochloride in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus , the profile of adverse reactions was similar to that observed in adults .
Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of metformin .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Cholestatic , hepatocellular , and mixed hepatocellular liver injury have been reported with postmarketing use of metformin .
Table 3 presents clinically significant drug interactions with metformin hydrochloride .
Table 3 : Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Metformin Hydrochloride Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Clinical Impact : Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors frequently cause a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non - anion gap , hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis .
Concomitant use of these drugs with metformin hydrochloride may increase the risk for lactic acidosis .
Intervention : Consider more frequent monitoring of these patients .
Examples : Topiramate , zonisamide , acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide .
Drugs that Reduce Metformin Hydrochloride Clearance Clinical Impact : Concomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of metformin ( e . g . , organic cationic transporter - 2 [ OCT2 ] / multidrug and toxin extrusion [ MATE ] inhibitors ) could increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis .
Intervention : Consider the benefits and the risks of concomitant use with metformin hydrochloride .
Examples : Ranolazine , vandetanib , dolutegravir , and cimetidine .
Alcohol Clinical Impact : Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism .
Intervention : Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride .
Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin Clinical Impact : Coadministration of metformin hydrocholoride with an insulin secretagogue ( e . g . , sulfonylurea ) or insulin may increase the risk of hypoglycemia .
Intervention : Patients receiving an insulin secretagogue or insulin may require lower doses of the insulin secretagogue or insulin .
Drugs Affecting Glycemic Control Clinical Impact : Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control .
Intervention : When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving metformin hydrochloride , observe the patient closely for loss of blood glucose control .
When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving metformin hydrochloride , observe the patient closely for hypoglycemia .
Examples : Thiazides and other diuretics , corticosteroids , phenothiazines , thyroid products , estrogens , oral contraceptives , phenytoin , nicotinic acid , sympathomimetics , calcium channel blockers , and isoniazid .
Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with metformin hydrochloride in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug - associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage .
Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk [ see Data ] .
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
No adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 2 - and 5 - times , respectively , a 2550 mg clinical dose , based on body surface area [ see Data ] .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10 % in women with pre - gestational diabetes mellitus with an HbA1C > 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25 % in women with a HbA1C > 10 .
The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk Poorly - controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis , pre - eclampsia , spontaneous abortions , preterm delivery , stillbirth and delivery complications .
Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus increases the fetal risk for major birth defects , stillbirth , and macrosomia related morbidity .
Data Human Data Published data from post - marketing studies have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin was used during pregnancy .
However , these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any metformin - associated risk because of methodological limitations , including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups .
Animal Data Metformin hydrochloride did not adversely affect development outcomes when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg / kg / day .
This represents an exposure of about 2 and 5 times a 2550 mg clinical dose based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits , respectively .
Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin .
Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk [ see Data ] .
However , there is insufficient information to determine the effects of metformin on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of metformin on milk production .
Therefore , the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for metformin hydrochloride and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from metformin hydrochloride or from the underlying maternal condition .
Data Published clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk which resulted in infant doses approximately 0 . 11 % to 1 % of the maternal weight - adjusted dosage and a milk / plasma ratio ranging between 0 . 13 and 1 .
However , the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants .
Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as therapy with metformin hydrochloride may result in ovulation in some anovulatory women .
Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus have been established in pediatric patients 10 to 16 years old .
Safety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride have not been established in pediatric patients less than 10 years old .
Use of metformin hydrochloride in pediatric patients 10 to 16 years old for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies of metformin hydrochloride in adults with additional data from a controlled clinical study in pediatric patients 10 to 16 years old with type 2 diabetes mellitus , which demonstrated a similar response in glycemic control to that seen in adults .
In this study , adverse reactions were similar to those described in adults .
A maximum daily dose of 2000 mg of metformin hydrochloride is recommended .
Geriatric Use Controlled clinical studies of metformin hydrochloride did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis .
Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients .
Renal Impairment Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment .
Metformin hydrochloride is contraindicated in severe renal impairment , patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) below 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 .
Hepatic Impairment Use of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis .
Metformin hydrochloride is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment .
Overdose of metformin hydrochloride has occurred , including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams .
Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10 % of cases , but no causal association with metformin has been established .
Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32 % of metformin overdose cases .
Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL / min under good hemodynamic conditions .
Therefore , hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected .
Metformin hydrochloride tablets , USP contain the antihyperglycemic agent metformin , which is a biguanide , in the form of monohydrochloride .
The chemical name of metformin hydrochloride is N , N - dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide hydrochloride .
The structural formula is as shown below : H 3 C \ N - C - NH - C - NH 2 • HCI / | | | | H 3 C NH NH Metformin hydrochloride , USP is a white to off - white crystalline compound with a molecular formula of C4H11N5 • HCl and a molecular weight of 165 . 63 .
Metformin hydrochloride , USP is freely soluble in water and is practically insoluble in acetone , ether , and chloroform .
The pKa of metformin is 12 . 4 .
The pH of a 1 % aqueous solution of metformin hydrochloride is 6 . 68 .
Metformin hydrochloride tablets , USP contain 500 mg , 850 mg , or 1000 mg of metformin hydrochloride USP .
Each tablet contains the inactive ingredients povidone and magnesium stearate .
In addition , the coating for the 500 mg , 850 mg , and 1000 mg contains hypromellose and polyethylene glycol .
Mechanism of Action Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus , lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose .
Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production , decreases intestinal absorption of glucose , and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization .
With metformin therapy , insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day - long plasma insulin response may decrease .
Pharmacokinetics Absorption The absolute bioavailability of a metformin hydrochloride 500 mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50 % to 60 % .
Studies using single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride 500 to 1500 mg and 850 to 2550 mg , indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses , which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination .
At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin hydrochloride , steady state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 to 48 hours and are generally < 1 mcg / mL .
Effect of food : Food decreases the extent of absorption and slightly delays the absorption of metformin , as shown by approximately a 40 % lower mean peak plasma concentration ( Cmax ) , a 25 % lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve ( AUC ) , and a 35 - minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration ( Tmax ) following administration of a single 850 mg tablet of metformin hydrochloride with food , compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting .
Distribution The apparent volume of distribution ( V / F ) of metformin following single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride 850 mg averaged 654 ± 358 L . Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins .
Metformin partitions into erythrocytes , most likely as a function of time .
Metabolism Intravenous single - dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism ( no metabolites have been identified in humans ) nor biliary excretion .
Elimination Renal clearance ( see Table 4 ) is approximately 3 . 5 times greater than creatinine clearance , which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination .
Following oral administration , approximately 90 % of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours , with a plasma elimination half - life of approximately 6 . 2 hours .
In blood , the elimination half - life is approximately 17 . 6 hours , suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution .
Specific Populations Renal Impairment In patients with decreased renal function the plasma and blood half - life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased ( see Table 3 ) .
Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment .
Geriatrics Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin hydrochloride in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased , the half - life is prolonged , and Cmax is increased , compared to healthy young subjects .
It appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function ( see Table 4 ) .

Gender Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender ( males = 19 , females = 16 ) .
Race No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed .

These doses are both approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2550 mg based on body surface area comparisons .
No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice .
Similarly , there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats .
There was , however , an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg / kg / day .
There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests : Ames test ( S . typhimurium ) , gene mutation test ( mouse lymphoma cells ) , or chromosomal aberrations test ( human lymphocytes ) .
Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative .
Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg / kg / day , which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2550 mg based on body surface area comparisons .
Metformin Hydrochloride Adult Clinical Studies A double - blind , placebo - controlled , multicenter US clinical trial involving obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose hyperglycemia was not adequately controlled with dietary management alone ( baseline fasting plasma glucose [ FPG ] of approximately 240 mg / dL ) was conducted .
Patients were treated with metformin hydrochloride ( up to 2550 mg / day ) or placebo for 29 weeks .
The results are presented in Table 7 .

Mean change in body weight from baseline to week 29 was - 1 . 4 lbs and - 2 . 4 lbs in the metformin hydrochloride and placebo arms , respectively .
A 29 - week , double - blind , placebo - controlled study of metformin hydrochloride and glyburide , alone and in combination , was conducted in obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had failed to achieve adequate glycemic control while on maximum doses of glyburide ( baseline FPG of approximately 250 mg / dL ) .
Patients randomized to the combination arm started therapy with metformin hydrochloride 500 mg and glyburide 20 mg .
At the end of each week of the first 4 weeks of the trial , these patients had their dosages of metformin hydrochloride increased by 500 mg if they had failed to reach target fasting plasma glucose .
After week 4 , such dosage adjustments were made monthly , although no patient was allowed to exceed metformin hydrochloride 2500 mg .
Patients in the metformin hydrochloride only arm ( metformin plus placebo ) discontinued glyburide and followed the same titration schedule .
Patients in the glyburide arm continued the same dose of glyburide .
