5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Severe , potentially life - threatening and fatal skin reactions have been reported .
This includes cases of Stevens - Johnson syndrome , hypersensitivity reaction and toxic epidermal necrolysis .
Immediately discontinue treatment with ISENTRESS and other suspect agents if severe hypersensitivity , severe rash , or rash with systemic symptoms or liver aminotransferase elevations develops and monitor clinical status , including liver aminotransferases closely ( 5 . 1 ) .
• Monitor for Immune Reconstitution Syndrome ( 5 . 2 ) .
• Inform patients with phenylketonuria that the 100 mg and 25 mg chewable tablets contain phenylalanine ( 5 . 3 ) .
5 . 1 Severe Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe , potentially life - threatening , and fatal skin reactions have been reported .
These include cases of Stevens - Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis .
Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported and were characterized by rash , constitutional findings , and sometimes , organ dysfunction , including hepatic failure .
Discontinue ISENTRESS and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop ( including , but not limited to , severe rash or rash accompanied by fever , general malaise , fatigue , muscle or joint aches , blisters , oral lesions , conjunctivitis , facial edema , hepatitis , eosinophilia , angioedema ) .
Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated .
Delay in stopping ISENTRESS treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of severe rash may result in a life - threatening reaction .
5 . 2 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome During the initial phase of treatment , patients responding to antiretroviral therapy may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as Mycobacterium avium complex , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia , Mycobacterium tuberculosis , or reactivation of varicella zoster virus ) , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
5 . 3 Phenylketonurics ISENTRESS Chewable Tablets contain phenylalanine , a component of aspartame .
Each 25 mg ISENTRESS Chewable Tablet contains approximately 0 . 05 mg phenylalanine .
Each 100 mg ISENTRESS Chewable Tablet contains approximately 0 . 10 mg phenylalanine .
Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
• The most common adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity ( ≥ 2 % ) which occurred at a higher rate than the comparator are insomnia and headache ( 6 . 1 and 6 . 2 ) .
• Creatine kinase elevations were observed in subjects who received ISENTRESS .
Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported .
Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis , such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions ( 6 . 3 ) .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience : Treatment - Naïve Adults The following safety assessment of ISENTRESS in treatment - naïve subjects is based on the randomized double - blind active controlled study of treatment - naïve subjects , STARTMRK ( Protocol 021 ) with ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in combination with a fixed dose of emtricitabine 200 mg ( + ) tenofovir 300 mg , ( N = 281 ) versus efavirenz ( EFV ) 600 mg at bedtime in combination with emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir , ( N = 282 ) .
During double - blind treatment , the total follow - up for subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily + emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir was 480 patient - years and 463 patient - years for subjects receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime + emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir .
In Protocol 021 , the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions was 4 % in subjects receiving ISENTRESS + emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir and 7 % in subjects receiving efavirenz + emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir .
The clinical adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) listed below were considered by investigators to be causally related to ISENTRESS + emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir or efavirenz + emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir .
Clinical ADRs of moderate to severe intensity occurring in ≥ 2 % of treatment - naïve subjects treated with ISENTRESS and occurring at a higher rate than efavirenz are presented in Table 2 .

6 . 2 Clinical Trials Experience : Treatment - Experienced Adults The safety assessment of ISENTRESS in treatment - experienced subjects is based on the pooled safety data from the randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials , BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 ( Protocols 018 and 019 ) in antiretroviral treatment - experienced HIV - 1 infected adult subjects .
A total of 462 subjects received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in combination with optimized background therapy ( OBT ) compared to 237 subjects taking placebo in combination with OBT .
The median duration of therapy in these trials was 96 weeks for subjects receiving ISENTRESS and 38 weeks for subjects receiving placebo .
The total exposure to ISENTRESS was 708 patient - years versus 244 patient - years on placebo .
The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 4 % in subjects receiving ISENTRESS and 5 % in subjects receiving placebo .
Clinical ADRs were considered by investigators to be causally related to ISENTRESS + OBT or placebo + OBT .
Clinical ADRs of moderate to severe intensity occurring in ≥ 2 % of subjects treated with ISENTRESS and occurring at a higher rate compared to placebo are presented in Table 5 .

These events have been included because of their seriousness , increased frequency on ISENTRESS compared with efavirenz or placebo , or investigator ' s assessment of potential causal relationship .
Gastrointestinal Disorders : abdominal pain , gastritis , dyspepsia , vomiting , nausea General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : fatigue , asthenia Hepatobiliary Disorders : hepatitis Immune System Disorders : hypersensitivity Infections and Infestations : genital herpes , herpes zoster Nervous System Disorders : dizziness Psychiatric Disorders : depression ( particularly in subjects with a pre - existing history of psychiatric illness ) , including suicidal ideation and behaviors Renal and Urinary Disorders : nephrolithiasis , renal failure 6 . 3 Selected Adverse Events Cancers were reported in treatment - experienced subjects who initiated ISENTRESS or placebo , both with OBT , and in treatment - naïve subjects who initiated ISENTRESS or efavirenz , both with emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir ; several were recurrent .
The types and rates of specific cancers were those expected in a highly immunodeficient population ( many had CD4 + counts below 50 cells / mm3 and most had prior AIDS diagnoses ) .
The risk of developing cancer in these studies was similar in the group receiving ISENTRESS and the group receiving the comparator .
Grade 2 - 4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in subjects treated with ISENTRESS ( see Table 6 ) .
Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported .
Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis , such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions .
Rash occurred more commonly in treatment - experienced subjects receiving regimens containing ISENTRESS + darunavir / ritonavir compared to subjects receiving ISENTRESS without darunavir / ritonavir or darunavir / ritonavir without ISENTRESS .
However , rash that was considered drug related occurred at similar rates for all three groups .
These rashes were mild to moderate in severity and did not limit therapy ; there were no discontinuations due to rash .
6 . 4 Patients with Co - existing Conditions Patients Co - infected with Hepatitis B and / or Hepatitis C Virus In the randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials , treatment - experienced subjects ( N = 114 / 699 or 16 % ) and treatment - naïve subjects ( N = 34 / 563 or 6 % ) with chronic ( but not acute ) active hepatitis B and / or hepatitis C virus co - infection were permitted to enroll provided that baseline liver function tests did not exceed 5 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) .
In general the safety profile of ISENTRESS in subjects with hepatitis B and / or hepatitis C virus co - infection was similar to that in subjects without hepatitis B and / or hepatitis C virus co - infection , although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were higher in the subgroup with hepatitis B and / or hepatitis C virus co - infection for all treatment groups .
In treatment - experienced subjects , Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST , ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29 % , 34 % and 13 % , respectively , of co - infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS as compared to 11 % , 10 % and 9 % of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS .
In treatment - naïve subjects , Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST , ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 17 % , 28 % and 17 % , respectively , of co - infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS as compared to 6 % , 6 % and 3 % of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS .
6 . 5 Clinical Trials Experience : Pediatrics ISENTRESS has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment - experienced HIV - 1 infected children and adolescents 2 through 18 years of age , in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Of the 126 patients , 96 received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS .
In these 96 children and adolescents , frequency , type and severity of drug related adverse reactions through Week 24 were comparable to those observed in adults .
One patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity , abnormal behavior and insomnia ; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic rash .
One patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities , Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT , which were considered serious .
6 . 6 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ISENTRESS .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : thrombocytopenia Gastrointestinal Disorders : diarrhea Hepatobiliary Disorders : hepatic failure ( with and without associated hypersensitivity ) in patients with underlying liver disease and / or concomitant medications Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : rhabdomyolysis Nervous System Disorders : cerebellar ataxia Psychiatric Disorders : anxiety , paranoia 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Coadministration of ISENTRESS with drugs that are strong inducers of UGT1A1 may result in reduced plasma concentrations of raltegravir ( 7 . 2 ) .
7 . 1 Effect of Raltegravir on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Agents Raltegravir does not inhibit ( IC50 > 100 µM ) CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 or CYP3A in vitro .
Moreover , in vitro , raltegravir did not induce CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 .
A midazolam drug interaction study confirmed the low propensity of raltegravir to alter the pharmacokinetics of agents metabolized by CYP3A4 in vivo by demonstrating a lack of effect of raltegravir on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam , a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate .
Similarly , raltegravir is not an inhibitor ( IC50 > 50 µM ) of the UDP - glucuronosyltransferases ( UGT ) tested ( UGT1A1 , UGT2B7 ) , and raltegravir does not inhibit P - glycoprotein - mediated transport .
Based on these data , ISENTRESS is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates of these enzymes or P - glycoprotein ( e . g . , protease inhibitors , NNRTIs , opioid analgesics , statins , azole antifungals , proton pump inhibitors and anti - erectile dysfunction agents ) .
In drug interaction studies , raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of the following : hormonal contraceptives , methadone , lamivudine , tenofovir , etravirine , darunavir / ritonavir .
7 . 2 Effect of Other Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir Raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes .
Based on in vivo and in vitro studies , raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a UGT1A1 - mediated glucuronidation pathway .
Rifampin , a strong inducer of UGT1A1 , reduces plasma concentrations of ISENTRESS .
Therefore , in adults the dose of ISENTRESS should be increased during coadministration with rifampin .
There are no data to guide co - administration of ISENTRESS with rifampin in patients below 18 years of age [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
The impact of other inducers of drug metabolizing enzymes , such as phenytoin and phenobarbital , on UGT1A1 is unknown .
Coadministration of ISENTRESS with drugs that inhibit UGT1A1 may increase plasma levels of raltegravir .
All interaction studies were performed in adults .
Selected drug interactions are presented in Table 7 [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Table 7 : Selected Drug Interactions in AdultsConcomitant Drug Class : Drug Name Effect on Concentration of Raltegravir Clinical Comment HIV - 1 - Antiviral Agents atazanavir ↑ Atazanavir , a strong inhibitor of UGT1A1 , increases plasma concentrations of raltegravir .
However , since concomitant use of ISENTRESS with atazanavir / ritonavir did not result in a unique safety signal in Phase 3 studies , no dose adjustment is recommended .
atazanavir / ritonavir ↑ Atazanavir / ritonavir increases plasma concentrations of raltegravir .
However , since concomitant use of ISENTRESS with atazanavir / ritonavir did not result in a unique safety signal in Phase 3 studies , no dose adjustment is recommended .
efavirenz ↓ Efavirenz reduces plasma concentrations of raltegravir .
The clinical significance of this interaction has not been directly assessed .
etravirine ↓ Etravirine reduces plasma concentrations of raltegravir .
The clinical significance of this interaction has not been directly assessed .
tipranavir / ritonavir ↓ Tipranavir / ritonavir reduces plasma concentrations of raltegravir .
However , since comparable efficacy was observed for this combination relative to other ISENTRESS - containing regimens in Phase 3 studies 018 and 019 , no dose adjustment is recommended .
Other Agents omeprazole ↑ Coadministration of medicinal products that increase gastric pH ( e . g . , omeprazole ) may increase raltegravir levels based on increased raltegravir solubility at higher pH . However , since concomitant use of ISENTRESS with proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers did not result in a unique safety signal in Phase 3 studies , no dose adjustment is recommended .
rifampin ↓ Rifampin , a strong inducer of UGT1A1 , reduces plasma concentrations of raltegravir .
The recommended dosage of ISENTRESS is 800 mg twice daily during coadministration with rifampin .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : • ISENTRESS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus ( 8 . 1 ) .
• Pregnancy registry available ( 8 . 1 ) .
Nursing Mothers : • Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking ISENTRESS ( 8 . 3 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C ISENTRESS should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
In addition , there have been no pharmacokinetic studies conducted in pregnant patients .
Developmental toxicity studies were performed in rabbits ( at oral doses up to 1000 mg / kg / day ) and rats ( at oral doses up to 600 mg / kg / day ) .
The reproductive toxicity study in rats was performed with pre - , peri - , and postnatal evaluation .
The highest doses in these studies produced systemic exposures in these species approximately 3 - to 4 - fold the exposure at the recommended human dose .
In both rabbits and rats , no treatment - related effects on embryonic / fetal survival or fetal weights were observed .
In addition , no treatment - related external , visceral , or skeletal changes were observed in rabbits .
However , treatment - related increases over controls in the incidence of supernumerary ribs were seen in rats at 600 mg / kg / day ( exposures 3 - fold the exposure at the recommended human dose ) .
Placenta transfer of drug was demonstrated in both rats and rabbits .
At a maternal dose of 600 mg / kg / day in rats , mean drug concentrations in fetal plasma were approximately 1 . 5 - to 2 . 5 - fold greater than in maternal plasma at 1 hour and 24 hours postdose , respectively .
Mean drug concentrations in fetal plasma were approximately 2 % of the mean maternal concentration at both 1 and 24 hours postdose at a maternal dose of 1000 mg / kg / day in rabbits .
Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry To monitor maternal - fetal outcomes of pregnant patients exposed to ISENTRESS , an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established .
Physicians are encouraged to register patients by calling 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Breastfeeding is not recommended while taking ISENTRESS .
In addition , it is recommended that HIV - 1 - infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV - 1 .
It is not known whether raltegravir is secreted in human milk .
However , raltegravir is secreted in the milk of lactating rats .
Mean drug concentrations in milk were approximately 3 - fold greater than those in maternal plasma at a maternal dose of 600 mg / kg / day in rats .
There were no effects in rat offspring attributable to exposure of ISENTRESS through the milk .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic profile , and efficacy of ISENTRESS were evaluated in HIV - 1 infected children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age in an open - label , multicenter clinical trial , IMPAACT P1066 [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
The safety profile was comparable to that observed in adults [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 5 ) ] .
See Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) for dosing recommendations for children 2 years of age and older .
Safety and effectiveness of ISENTRESS in children under 2 years of age have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ISENTRESS did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and healthy subjects were observed .
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with severe renal impairment and healthy subjects were observed .
No dosage adjustment is necessary [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with ISENTRESS .
Doses as high as 1600 - mg single dose and 800 - mg twice - daily multiple doses were studied in healthy volunteers without evidence of toxicity .
Occasional doses of up to 1800 mg per day were taken in the clinical studies of HIV - 1 infected subjects without evidence of toxicity .
In the event of an overdose , it is reasonable to employ the standard supportive measures , e . g . , remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract , employ clinical monitoring ( including obtaining an electrocardiogram ) , and institute supportive therapy if required .
The extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Raltegravir is an HIV - 1 antiviral drug [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In a monotherapy study raltegravir ( 400 mg twice daily ) demonstrated rapid antiviral activity with mean viral load reduction of 1 . 66 log10 copies / mL by Day 10 .
In the randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , dose - ranging trial , Protocol 005 , and Protocols 018 and 019 , antiviral responses were similar among subjects regardless of dose .
Effects on Electrocardiogram In a randomized , placebo - controlled , crossover study , 31 healthy subjects were administered a single oral supratherapeutic dose of raltegravir 1600 mg and placebo .
Peak raltegravir plasma concentrations were approximately 4 - fold higher than the peak concentrations following a 400 mg dose .
ISENTRESS did not appear to prolong the QTc interval for 12 hours postdose .
After baseline and placebo adjustment , the maximum mean QTc change was - 0 . 4 msec ( 1 - sided 95 % upper Cl : 3 . 1 msec ) .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Adults Absorption Raltegravir ( film - coated tablet ) is absorbed with a Tmax of approximately 3 hours postdose in the fasted state .
Raltegravir AUC and Cmax increase dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1600 mg .
Raltegravir C12hr increases dose proportionally over the dose range of 100 to 800 mg and increases slightly less than dose proportionally over the dose range 100 mg to 1600 mg .
With twice - daily dosing , pharmacokinetic steady state is achieved within approximately the first 2 days of dosing .
There is little to no accumulation in AUC and Cmax .
The average accumulation ratio for C12hr ranged from approximately 1 . 2 to 1 . 6 .
The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established .
Based on a formulation comparison study in healthy adult volunteers , the chewable tablet has higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg film - coated tablet .
In subjects who received 400 mg twice daily alone , raltegravir drug exposures were characterized by a geometric mean AUC0 - 12 hr of 14 . 3 µM ∙ hr and C12hr of 142 nM .
Considerable variability was observed in the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir .
For observed C12hr in Protocols 018 and 019 , the coefficient of variation ( CV ) for inter - subject variability = 212 % and the CV for intra - subject variability = 122 % .
Effect of Food on Oral Absorption ISENTRESS may be administered with or without food .
Raltegravir was administered without regard to food in the pivotal safety and efficacy studies in HIV - 1 - infected patients .
The effect of consumption of low - , moderate - and high - fat meals on steady - state raltegravir pharmacokinetics was assessed in healthy volunteers administered the 400 mg film - coated tablet .
Administration of multiple doses of raltegravir following a moderate - fat meal ( 600 Kcal , 21 g fat ) did not affect raltegravir AUC to a clinically meaningful degree with an increase of 13 % relative to fasting .
Raltegravir C12hr was 66 % higher and Cmax was 5 % higher following a moderate - fat meal compared to fasting .
Administration of raltegravir following a high - fat meal ( 825 Kcal , 52 g fat ) increased AUC and Cmax by approximately 2 - fold and increased C12hr by 4 . 1 - fold .
Administration of raltegravir following a low - fat meal ( 300 Kcal , 2 . 5 g fat ) decreased AUC and Cmax by 46 % and 52 % , respectively ; C12hr was essentially unchanged .
Food appears to increase pharmacokinetic variability relative to fasting .
Administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal led to an average 6 % decrease in AUC , 62 % decrease in Cmax , and 188 % increase in C12hr compared to administration in the fasted state .
Administration of the chewable tablet with a high fat meal does not affect raltegravir pharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful degree and the chewable tablet can be administered without regard to food .
Distribution Raltegravir is approximately 83 % bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to 10 µM .
Metabolism and Excretion The apparent terminal half - life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours , with a shorter α - phase half - life ( ~ 1 hour ) accounting for much of the AUC .
Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled raltegravir , approximately 51 and 32 % of the dose was excreted in feces and urine , respectively .
In feces , only raltegravir was present , most of which is likely derived from hydrolysis of raltegravir - glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species .
Two components , namely raltegravir and raltegravir - glucuronide , were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and 23 % of the dose , respectively .
The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented approximately 70 % of the total radioactivity ; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for by raltegravir - glucuronide .
Studies using isoform - selective chemical inhibitors and cDNA - expressed UDP - glucuronosyltransferases ( UGT ) show that UGT1A1 is the main enzyme responsible for the formation of raltegravir - glucuronide .
Thus , the data indicate that the major mechanism of clearance of raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1 - mediated glucuronidation .
Special Populations Pediatric The doses recommended for HIV - infected children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] resulted in a pharmacokinetic profile of raltegravir similar to that observed in adults receiving 400 mg twice daily .
Table 8 displays steady state pharmacokinetic parameters in the 400 mg film - coated tablet ( 6 to 18 years of age ) and the chewable tablet ( 2 to less than 12 years of age ) .

Age The effect of age ( 18 years and older ) on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir was evaluated in the composite analysis .
No dosage adjustment is necessary .
Race The effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir in adults was evaluated in the composite analysis .
No dosage adjustment is necessary .
Gender A study of the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir was performed in healthy adult males and females .
Additionally , the effect of gender was evaluated in a composite analysis of pharmacokinetic data from 103 healthy subjects and 28 HIV - 1 infected subjects receiving raltegravir monotherapy with fasted administration .
No dosage adjustment is necessary .
Hepatic Impairment Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver .
A study of the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir was performed in adult subjects with moderate hepatic impairment .
Additionally , hepatic impairment was evaluated in the composite pharmacokinetic analysis .
There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with moderate hepatic impairment and healthy subjects .
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment .
The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied .
Renal Impairment Renal clearance of unchanged drug is a minor pathway of elimination .
A study of the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir was performed in adult subjects with severe renal impairment .
Additionally , renal impairment was evaluated in the composite pharmacokinetic analysis .
There were no clinically important pharmacokinetic differences between subjects with severe renal impairment and healthy subjects .
No dosage adjustment is necessary .
Because the extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown , dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided .
UGT1A1 Polymorphism There is no evidence that common UGT1A1 polymorphisms alter raltegravir pharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful extent .
In a comparison of 30 adult subjects with * 28 / * 28 genotype ( associated with reduced activity of UGT1A1 ) to 27 adult subjects with wild - type genotype , the geometric mean ratio ( 90 % CI ) of AUC was 1 . 41 ( 0 . 96 , 2 . 09 ) .

Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion , or integration , of unintegrated linear HIV - 1 DNA into the host cell genome preventing the formation of the HIV - 1 provirus .
The provirus is required to direct the production of progeny virus , so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral infection .
Raltegravir did not significantly inhibit human phosphoryltransferases including DNA polymerases α , β , and γ .
Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 ± 20 nM resulted in 95 % inhibition ( EC95 ) of viral spread ( relative to an untreated virus - infected culture ) in human T - lymphoid cell cultures infected with the cell - line adapted HIV - 1 variant H9IIIB .
In addition , 5 clinical isolates of HIV - 1 subtype B had EC95 values ranging from 9 to 19 nM in cultures of mitogen - activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
In a single - cycle infection assay , raltegravir inhibited infection of 23 HIV - 1 isolates representing 5 non - B subtypes ( A , C , D , F , and G ) and 5 circulating recombinant forms ( AE , AG , BF , BG , and cpx ) with EC50 values ranging from 5 to 12 nM .
Raltegravir also inhibited replication of an HIV - 2 isolate when tested in CEMx174 cells ( EC95 value = 6 nM ) .
Additive to synergistic antiretroviral activity was observed when human T - lymphoid cells infected with the H9IIIB variant of HIV - 1 were incubated with raltegravir in combination with non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( delavirdine , efavirenz , or nevirapine ) ; nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( abacavir , didanosine , lamivudine , stavudine , tenofovir , zalcitabine , or zidovudine ) ; protease inhibitors ( amprenavir , atazanavir , indinavir , lopinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , or saquinavir ) ; or the entry inhibitor enfuvirtide .
Resistance The mutations observed in the HIV - 1 integrase coding sequence that contributed to raltegravir resistance ( evolved either in cell culture or in subjects treated with raltegravir ) generally included an amino acid substitution at either Y143 ( changed to C , H , or R ) or Q148 ( changed to H , K , or R ) or N155 ( changed to H ) plus one or more additional substitutions ( i . e . , L74M , E92Q , Q95K / R , T97A , E138A / K , G140A / S , V151I , G163R , H183P , Y226C / D / F / H , S230R , and D232N ) .
Treatment - Naïve Adult Subjects : By Week 96 in the STARTMRK trial , the primary raltegravir resistance - associated substitutions were observed in 4 ( 2 with Y143H / R and 2 with Q148H / R ) of the 10 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment - failure isolates .
Treatment - Experienced Adult Subjects : By Week 96 in the BENCHMRK trials , at least one of the primary raltegravir resistance - associated substitutions , Y143C / H / R , Q148H / K / R , and N155H , was observed in 76 of the 112 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment - failure isolates .
The emergence of the primary raltegravir resistance - associated substitutions was observed cumulatively in 70 subjects by Week 48 and 78 subjects by Week 96 , 15 . 2 % and 17 % of the raltegravir recipients , respectively .
Some ( n = 58 ) of those HIV - 1 isolates harboring one or more of the primary raltegravir resistance - associated substitutions were evaluated for raltegravir susceptibility yielding a median decrease of 26 . 3 - fold ( mean 48 . 9 ± 44 . 8 - fold decrease , ranging from 0 . 8 - to 159 - fold ) compared to the wild - type reference .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies of raltegravir in mice did not show any carcinogenic potential .
At the highest dose levels , 400 mg / kg / day in females and 250 mg / kg / day in males , systemic exposure was 1 . 8 - fold ( females ) or 1 . 2 - fold ( males ) greater than the AUC ( 54 µM ∙ hr ) at the 400 - mg twice daily human dose .
Treatment - related squamous cell carcinoma of nose / nasopharynx was observed in female rats dosed with 600 mg / kg / day raltegravir for 104 weeks .
These tumors were possibly the result of local irritation and inflammation due to local deposition and / or aspiration of drug in the mucosa of the nose / nasopharynx during dosing .
No tumors of the nose / nasopharynx were observed in rats dosed with 150 mg / kg / day ( males ) and 50 mg / kg / day ( females ) and the systemic exposure in rats was 1 . 7 - fold ( males ) to 1 . 4 - fold ( females ) greater than the AUC ( 54 μM ∙ hr ) at the 400 - mg twice daily human dose .
No evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis ( Ames ) tests , in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage , and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal aberration studies .
No effect on fertility was seen in male and female rats at doses up to 600 mg / kg / day which resulted in a 3 - fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Description of Clinical Studies The evidence of durable efficacy of ISENTRESS is based on the analyses of 96 - week data from an ongoing , randomized , double - blind , active - control trial , STARTMRK ( Protocol 021 ) in antiretroviral treatment - naïve HIV - 1 infected adult subjects and from 2 ongoing , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled studies , BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 ( Protocols 018 and 019 ) , in antiretroviral treatment - experienced HIV - 1 infected adult subjects .

14 . 2 Treatment - Experienced Adult Subjects BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 are Phase 3 studies to evaluate the safety and antiretroviral activity of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in combination with an optimized background therapy ( OBT ) , versus OBT alone , in HIV - 1 - infected subjects , 16 years or older , with documented resistance to at least 1 drug in each of 3 classes ( NNRTIs , NRTIs , PIs ) of antiretroviral therapies .
Randomization was stratified by degree of resistance to PI ( 1 PI vs . > 1 PI ) and the use of enfuvirtide in the OBT .
Prior to randomization , OBT was selected by the investigator based on genotypic / phenotypic resistance testing and prior ART history .

14 . 3 Pediatric Subjects IMPAACT P1066 is a Phase I / II open label multicenter trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile , safety , tolerability , and efficacy of raltegravir in HIV infected children .
This study enrolled 126 treatment experienced children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age .
Subjects were stratified by age , enrolling adolescents first and then successively younger children .
Subjects received either the 400 mg film - coated tablet formulation ( 6 to 18 years of age ) or the chewable tablet formulation ( 2 to less than 12 years of age ) .
Raltegravir was administered with an optimized background regimen .
The initial dose finding stage included intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation .
Dose selection was based upon achieving similar raltegravir plasma exposure and trough concentration as seen in adults , and acceptable short term safety .
After dose selection , additional subjects were enrolled for evaluation of long term safety , tolerability and efficacy .
Of the 126 subjects , 96 received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
These 96 subjects had a median age of 13 ( range 2 to 18 ) years , were 51 % Female , 34 % Caucasian , and 59 % Black .
At baseline , mean plasma HIV - 1 RNA was 4 . 3 log10 copies / mL , median CD4 cell count was 481 cells / mm3 ( range : 0 – 2361 ) and median CD4 % was 23 . 3 % ( range : 0 – 44 ) .
Overall , 8 % had baseline plasma HIV - 1 RNA > 100 , 000 copies / mL and 59 % had a CDC HIV clinical classification of category B or C . Most subjects had previously used at least one NNRTI ( 78 % ) or one PI ( 83 % ) .
Ninety - three ( 97 % ) subjects 2 to 18 years of age completed 24 weeks of treatment ( 3 discontinued due to non - compliance ) .
At Week 24 , 54 % achieved HIV RNA < 50 copies / mL ; 72 % achieved HIV RNA < 400 copies / mL or ≥ 1 log10 HIV RNA drop from baseline .
The mean CD4 count ( percent ) increase from baseline to Week 24 was 119 cells / mm3 ( 3 . 8 % ) .
