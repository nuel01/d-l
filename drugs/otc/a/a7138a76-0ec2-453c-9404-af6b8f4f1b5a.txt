WHAT IS PSORIASIS AND SEBORRHEIC DERMATITIS ?
PSORIASIS is a non - contagious skin disorder that afflicts millions of men and women of all ages .
Normal skin cells multiply , mature and shed on a regular basis .
In those afflicted with psoriasis , skin cells appear to multiply much faster than normal , with excessive skin cells accumulating on the skin surface .
In its most common form , these cells form scaly , reddish patches which are often unsightly , uncomfortable and are frequently irritating , itchy and painful .
While the exact causes of psoriasis are still unknown , it is reported that a susceptibility to psoriasis may be inherited ... passed along from one generation to another genetically within families .
First visible outbreaks of psoriasis may be prompted by a stress such as surgery , a major infection , or a minor skin injury such as a burn or cut .
After the first outbreak , psoriasis flare - ups tend to come and go without any specific regularity or frequency , although symptoms appear to diminish during warm summer months and increase during cold winter months .
Some studies have shown a relationship between psoriasis flare - ups and periods of emotional stress .
The number of flare - ups and their intensity may differ from case to case .
Although there is no known cure for psoriasis , the active ingredient in PSORIASIN Therapeutic Shampoo and Body Wash has been proven to help effectively relieve and control the symptoms of psoriasis , as well as prevent recurrences .
SEBORRHEIC DERMATITIS is a distinctly different condition , though sometimes it is confused with psoriasis .
Seborrheic dermatitis is an inflammation affecting areas of the skin rich in sebaceous ( oil producing ) glands commonly on the hairy areas of the body , such as the scalp .
This troublesome skin disorder tends to be marked by skin cell proliferation and heightened sebaceous gland activity ... skin cells shed and become scaly , itchy , red and irritated .
Affected areas tend to display oily looking , yellowish , scaly patches .
People who tend toward oily skin are more likely to be affected .
While seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis are different disorders , highly visible symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis , such as intense itching and dandruff respond well ( as well as psoriasis symptoms ) to the active ingredient in PSORIASIN .
These symptoms can be relieved and controlled , as well as recurrences prevented , with regular use of PSORIASIN Therapeutic Shampoo and Body Wash .
HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE PSORIASIS OR SEBORRHEIC DERMATITIS OF THE SCALP OR BODY ?
In its most common form , known as plaque psoriasis , the condition is characterized by sharply defined raised reddish areas of skin or patches , typically covered with overlapping , rough , dry silvery scaling .
Often times outbreaks are accompanied by itching and flaking at the affected site .
In many cases skin is cracked , irritated and burning .
Seborrheic dermatitis frequently affects the scalp and other areas rich in sebaceous ( oil producing ) glands .
Seborrheic dermatitis tends to show up as thick , greasy , yellowish scales , accompanied by itching and irritation .
If you experience any type of unusual skin eruption ( s ) including those described here , contact your doctor to make the correct diagnosis and obtain professional advice .
You may wish to show him / her PSORIASIN Therapeutic Shampoo and Body Wash and discuss its use for relief and prevention .
