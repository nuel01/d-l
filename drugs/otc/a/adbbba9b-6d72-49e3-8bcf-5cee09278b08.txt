7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Certain OCT2 , MATE1 , and MATE - 2 K substrates : Avoid concomitant use with certain OCT2 , MATE1 , and MATE - 2 K substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious or life - threatening toxicities .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Effect of COSELA on Other Drugs , Certain OCT2 , MATE1 , and MATE - 2 K Substrates COSELA is an inhibitor of OCT2 , MATE1 , and MATE - 2 K .
Co - administration of COSELA may increase the concentration or net accumulation of OCT2 , MATE1 , and MATE - 2 K substrates in the kidney ( e . g . , dofetilide , dalfampridine , and cisplatin ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Refer to the prescribing information for these concomitant medications for assessing the benefit and risk of concomitant use of COSELA .
Table 4 : Potentially Significant Drug Interactions with COSELA Drugs Recommendations Comments Dofetilide The potential benefits of taking COSELA concurrently with dofetilide should be considered against the risk of QT interval prolongation .
Increased dofetilide blood levels may occur in patients who are also receiving COSELA .
Increased plasma concentrations of dofetilide may cause serious ventricular arrhythmias associated with QT interval prolongation , including torsade de pointes .
Dalfampridine The potential benefits of taking COSELA concurrently with dalfampridine should be considered against the risk of seizures in these patients .
Increased dalfampridine blood levels may occur in patients who are also receiving COSELA .
Elevated levels of dalfampridine increase the risk of seizure .
Cisplatin Closely monitor for nephrotoxicity .
Concurrent treatment with COSELA may increase the exposure and alter the net accumulation of cisplatin in the kidney , which may associate with dose - related nephrotoxicity .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on the mechanism of action , COSELA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ] .
There are no available human or animal data on COSELA use to evaluate for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
However , the background risk of major birth defects is 2 % to 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 % to 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies in the United States general population .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of trilaciclib in either human or animal milk , the effects on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children , advise lactating women to not breastfeed while taking COSELA and for at least 3 weeks after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Based on its mechanism of action , COSELA can cause fetal harm if administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating COSELA .
Contraception COSELA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with COSELA and for at least 3 weeks after the final dose .
Infertility No studies have been performed in humans to evaluate the effects of COSELA on fertility in either sex .
Based on animal toxicology studies , COSELA may impair fertility in females of reproductive potential [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In the pooled efficacy dataset from Studies 1 , 2 , and 3 , 46 % of 123 patients randomized to COSELA were ≥ 65 years of age , and 49 % of 119 patients randomized to placebo were ≥ 65 years of age .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of COSELA were observed between these patients and younger patients .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Use of COSELA is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment .
No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal [ ULN ] and aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ] > ULN , or total bilirubin > 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 × ULN , irrespective of AST ) .
The pharmacokinetics of COSELA have not been studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 × ULN , irrespective of AST ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION COSELA for injection contains trilaciclib dihydrochloride , a kinase inhibitor .
The chemical name for trilaciclib is 2 ' - { [ 5 - ( 4 - methylpiperazin - 1 - yl ) pyridin - 2 - yl ] amino } - 7 ' , 8 ' - dihydro - 6 ' H - spiro [ cyclohexane - 1 , 9 ' - pyrazino [ 1 ' , 2 ' : 1 , 5 ] pyrrolo [ 2 , 3 - d ] pyrimidin ] - 6 ' - one .
Trilaciclib dihydrochloride is a water - soluble yellow solid , with molecular formula of C24H30N8O • 2 HCl , a molecular weight of 519 . 48 g / mol ( Free base : 446 . 56 g / mol ) , and the following chemical structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] COSELA ( trilaciclib ) for injection is a sterile , preservative - free , yellow lyophilized cake in a single - dose vial for intravenous infusion after reconstitution and dilution .
Each single - dose vial contains the equivalent of 300 mg of trilaciclib ( provided as 349 mg of trilaciclib dihydrochloride ) and the following inactive ingredients : citric acid monohydrate ( 75 . 6 mg ) and mannitol ( 300 mg ) ; hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide to adjust pH . [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Trilaciclib is a transient inhibitor of CDK 4 and 6 .
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( HSPCs ) in the bone marrow give rise to circulating neutrophils , RBCs , and platelets .
HSPC proliferation is dependent on CDK4 / 6 activity .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Bone Marrow Trilaciclib exhibited dose - dependent inhibition of CD45 + / CD3 + lymphocyte proliferation following administration of single - dose COSELA 96 or 192 mg / m2 ( 0 . 4 or 0 . 8 times the approved recommended dose ) in healthy subjects .
Trilaciclib increased the percentage of cells arrested in G1 up to 32 hours post - infusion for all bone marrow progenitor subsets evaluated ( hematopoietic stem cell / multipotent progenitor , oligopotent progenitor , monocyte lineage , granulocyte lineage , erythroid lineage , and megakaryocyte lineage ) following a single dose of COSELA 192 mg / m2 ( 0 . 8 times the approved recommended dose ) in healthy subjects .
Partial recovery of the total bone marrow with resumption of proliferation of the bone marrow progenitor subsets was observed by 32 hours post - dose .
This transient G1 arrest of hematopoietic stem cells contributed to the myeloprotective effect of trilaciclib .
Cardiac Electrophysiology COSELA is associated with dose - dependent and delayed increase in the QTc interval .
The underlying mechanism of the delayed QT effect is unknown .
At the clinical dose of 240 mg / m2 , COSELA did not have a clinically relevant effect on QTc ( i . e . , > 10 msec ) .
QTc prolongation was observed at higher doses .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The maximum concentration ( Cmax ) increased proportionally whereas the total plasma exposure ( AUC0 - last ) increased slightly greater than proportional over a dosage range of trilaciclib 200 mg / m2 to 700 mg / m2 ( 0 . 83 to 2 . 9 times the approved recommended dose ) .
There was no accumulation of trilaciclib following repeated dosing .
Distribution Protein binding of trilaciclib has not been fully characterized in vitro .
The blood / plasma ratio ranged from 1 . 21 to 1 . 53 for trilaciclib across concentrations of 0 . 5 μg / mL to 50 μg / mL in vitro .
The volume of distribution at steady state was 1130 L . Elimination The mean terminal half - life of trilaciclib is approximately 14 hours .
Clearance was estimated to be 158 L / hr .
Metabolism Trilaciclib undergoes extensive metabolism .
Trilaciclib is the predominant circulating compound in plasma following intravenous administration , representing ~ 50 % of plasma total radioactivity .
Excretion After a single dose of radiolabeled trilaciclib 192 mg / m2 ( 0 . 8 times the approved recommended dosage ) , approximately 79 . 1 % of the dose was recovered in feces ( 7 % unchanged ) and 14 % was recovered in urine ( 2 % unchanged ) .
Trilaciclib is eliminated mainly via the fecal route , with a small contribution of the renal route .
Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of trilaciclib were observed based on age ( range : 19 to 80 years ) , sex , race , mild to moderate renal impairment ( 30 to 89 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate [ eGFR ] ) , or mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN , or total bilirubin > 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 × ULN , irrespective of AST ) .
The effect of severe renal impairment ( < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) , end stage renal disease or dialysis , or moderate or severe hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 × ULN and any AST ) on trilaciclib pharmacokinetics has not been studied .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) Enzymes : There were no clinically significant differences in trilaciclib pharmacokinetics when used concomitantly with itraconazole ( strong CYP3A inhibitor ) or rifampin ( strong CYP3A inducer ) .
There were no clinically significant differences in midazolam ( CYP3A substrate ) pharmacokinetics when used concomitantly with trilaciclib .
Transporter Systems : Concomitant use of trilaciclib increased metformin ( OCT2 , MATE1 , and MATE - 2 K substrate ) AUCinf and Cmax by approximately 65 % and 81 % , respectively .
Renal clearance of metformin was decreased by 37 % .
There were no clinically significant differences in topotecan ( MATE1 and MATE - 2 K substrate ) pharmacokinetics when used concomitantly with trilaciclib .
In Vitro Studies CYP Enzymes : Trilaciclib did not inhibit CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , or CYP2D6 .
Trilaciclib is an inducer for CYP1A2 , and is not an inducer for CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 .
Transporter Systems : Trilaciclib did not inhibit P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) , breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) , organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 ( OATP1B1 ) , OATP1B3 , OAT1 , or OAT3 .
Trilaciclib was a substrate of BCRP and P - gp , but not bile salt export pump ( BSEP ) , MATE1 , MATE - 2 K , or OCT .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis studies have not been conducted with trilaciclib .
Trilaciclib was negative for mutagenic potential in a bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay and negative for clastogenic potential in an in vitro histone H2AX phosphorylation assay in primary human fibroblasts .
Trilaciclib increased the frequency of micronucleus formation in human lymphocytes in vitro .
Clastogenic potential of trilaciclib was not assessed in vivo .
Fertility studies have not been performed to evaluate the effects of trilaciclib .
Treatment with trilaciclib in female rats and dogs resulted in reductions in mean ovary and uterus weights at clinically relevant exposures , which were reversible after a two - week drug - free recovery period .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of COSELA was established in three randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials in patients with extensive stage - small cell lung cancer ( ES - SCLC ) .
Study 1 ( G1T28 - 05 ; NCT03041311 ) enrolled adult patients receiving carboplatin , etoposide , and atezolizumab for newly diagnosed ES - SCLC .
Study 2 ( G1T28 - 02 ; NCT02499770 ) enrolled adult patients receiving etoposide / carboplatin for newly diagnosed ES - SCLC .
Study 3 ( G1T28 - 03 ; NCT02514447 ) enrolled adult patients receiving topotecan for previously treated ES - SCLC .
During Cycle 1 , all three studies prohibited primary prophylactic granulocyte - colony stimulating factor ( G - CSF ) and erythropoiesis - stimulating agent ( ESA ) use .
Both ESAs and prophylactic G - CSF were allowed from Cycle 2 onwards as clinically indicated .
Therapeutic G - CSF , RBC , and platelet transfusions were allowed at any time during the studies as clinically indicated .
Study 1 : COSELA Prior to Etoposide , Carboplatin , and Atezolizumab ( E / P / A ) Patients with newly diagnosed ES - SCLC not previously treated with chemotherapy Study 1 ( G1T28 - 05 ) was a randomized ( 1 : 1 ) , double - blind , placebo - controlled study of COSELA or placebo administered prior to treatment with etoposide , carboplatin , and atezolizumab ( E / P / A ) for patients with newly diagnosed ES - SCLC not previously treated with chemotherapy .
A total of 107 patients were randomized to receive COSELA ( n = 54 ) or placebo ( n = 53 ) prior to administration of E / P / A ; patients were stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( 0 to 1 vs 2 ) and the presence of brain metastases .
Carboplatin ( AUC 5 ) and atezolizumab ( 1200 mg ) were administered on Day 1 and etoposide ( 100 mg / m2 ) and COSELA ( 240 mg / m2 ) or placebo were administered on Days 1 , 2 , and 3 of a 21 - day cycle for a maximum of 4 cycles ( induction ) .
After induction , maintenance atezolizumab ( 1200 mg ) monotherapy on Day 1 of a 21 - day cycle continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
COSELA was not administered during maintenance .
The study population characteristics were : median age 64 years ( range : 45 to 83 ) ; 70 % male ; 97 % white ; 14 % ECOG performance status 2 ; 28 % with a history of brain metastases ; 38 % current smokers ; 46 % lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) > ULN .
The mean relative dose intensities ( RDIs ) for E / P / A in patients receiving COSELA were 93 % , 95 % , and 93 % , respectively .
The mean RDIs for E / P / A in patients receiving placebo were 88 % , 89 % , and 91 % , respectively .
Dose reductions of carboplatin occurred in 2 % of patients receiving COSELA and in 25 % of patients receiving placebo ; dose reductions of etoposide occurred in 6 % of patients receiving COSELA and in 26 % of patients receiving placebo .
No dose reduction was allowed for COSELA or atezolizumab .
The study demonstrated a statistically significantly shorter duration of severe neutropenia ( DSN ) in Cycle 1 ( 0 vs 4 days ) and a lower proportion of patients with severe neutropenia ( SN ) ( 2 % vs 49 % ) in patients receiving COSELA compared with placebo ( Table 5 ) .
Nineteen percent of patients receiving COSELA had Grade 3 or 4 decreased hemoglobin compared with 28 % of patients receiving placebo ( adjusted relative risk 0 . 663 [ 95 % CI : 0 . 336 , 1 . 310 ] ) .
The rate of RBC transfusions over time was 1 . 7 / 100 weeks for patients receiving COSELA and 2 . 6 / 100 weeks for patients receiving placebo ( adjusted relative risk was not estimable ) .
Six percent of patients receiving COSELA received erythropoiesis - stimulating agents ( ESAs ) compared with 11 % of patients receiving placebo ( adjusted relative risk 0 . 529 [ 95 % CI : 0 . 145 , 1 . 927 ] ) .
