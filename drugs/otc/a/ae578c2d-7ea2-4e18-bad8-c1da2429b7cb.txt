This concentration is approximately 100 times less than concentrations afforded by a single 250 mg oral tablet .
The serum metronidazole concentrations were below the detectable limits of the assay at the majority of time points in all patients .
Three of the patients had no detectable serum concentrations of metronidazole at any time point .
The mean dose of gel applied during clinical studies was 600 mg which represents 4 . 5 mg of metronidazole per application .
Therefore , under normal usage levels , the formulation affords minimal serum concentrations of metronidazole .
The mechanisms by which metronidazole topical gel USP , 0 . 75 % , acts in the treatment of rosacea are unknown , but appear to include an anti - inflammatory effect .
INDICATIONS & USAGE Metronidazole topical gel USP , 0 . 75 % , is indicated for topical application in the treatment of inflammatory papules and pustules of rosacea .

DRUG INTERACTIONS Oral metronidazole has been reported to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of coumarin and warfarin resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time .
The effect of topical metronidazole on prothrombin time is not known .
CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Metronidazole has shown evidence of carcinogenic activity in a number of studies involving chronic , oral administration in mice and rats but not in studies involving hamsters .
Metronidazole has shown evidence of mutagenic activity in several in vitro bacterial assay systems .
In addition , a dose - response increase in the frequency of micronuclei was observed in mice after intraperitoneal injections and an increase in chromosome aberrations have been reported in patients with Crohn ' s disease who were treated with 200 - 1200 mg / day of metronidazole for 1 to 24 months .
However , no excess chromosomal aberrations in circulating human lymphocytes have been observed in patients treated for 8 months .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic effects : Pregnancy category B : There has been no experience to date with the use of metronidazole topical gel USP , 0 . 75 % , in pregnant patients .
Metronidazole crosses the placental barrier and enters the fetal circulation rapidly .
No fetotoxicity was observed after oral metronidazole in rats or mice .
However , because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response and since oral metronidazole has been shown to be a carcinogen in some rodents , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
NURSING MOTHERS After oral administration , metronidazole is secreted in breast milk in concentrations similar to those found in the plasma .
Even though metronidazole topical gel USP , 0 . 75 % , blood levels are significantly lower than those achieved after oral metronidazole , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
