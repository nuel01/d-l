WARNINGS NEUTREXIN ( TRIMETREXATE GLUCURONATE FOR INJECTION ) MUST BE USED WITH CONCURRENT LEUCOVORIN ( LEUCOVORIN PROTECTION ) TO AVOID POTENTIALLY SERIOUS OR LIFE - THREATENING TOXICITIES ( SEE PRECAUTIONS AND DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
DESCRIPTION Neutrexin is the brand name for trimetrexate glucuronate .
Trimetrexate , a 2 , 4 - diaminoquinazoline , non - classical folate antagonist , is a synthetic inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) .
Neutrexin is available as a sterile lyophilized powder , containing trimetrexate glucuronate equivalent to either 200 mg or 25 mg of trimetrexate without any preservatives or excipients .
The powder is reconstituted prior to intravenous infusion ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , RECONSTITUTION AND DILUTION ) .
Trimetrexate glucuronate is chemically known as 2 , 4 - diamino - 5 - methyl - 6 - [ ( 3 , 4 , 5 - trimethoxyanilino ) methyl ] quinazoline mono - D - glucuronate , and has the following structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The empirical formula for trimetrexate glucuronate is C19H23N5O3 • C6H10O7 with a molecular weight of 563 . 56 .
The active ingredient , trimetrexate free base , has an empirical formula of C19H23N5O3 with a molecular weight of 369 . 42 .
Trimetrexate glucuronate for injection is a pale greenish - yellow powder or cake .
Trimetrexate glucuronate is soluble in water ( > 50 mg / mL ) , whereas trimetrexate free base is practically insoluble in water ( < 0 . 1 mg / mL ) .
The pKa of trimetrexate free base in 50 % methanol / water is 8 . 0 .
The logarithm10 of the partition coefficient of trimetrexate free base between octanol and water is 1 . 63 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action In vitro studies have shown that trimetrexate is a competitive inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase ( DHFR ) from bacterial , protozoan , and mammalian sources .
DHFR catalyzes the reduction of intracellular dihydrofolate to the active coenzyme tetrahydrofolate .
Inhibition of DHFR results in the depletion of this coenzyme , leading directly to interference with thymidylate biosynthesis , as well as inhibition of folate - dependent formyltransferases , and indirectly to inhibition of purine biosynthesis .
The end result is disruption of DNA , RNA , and protein synthesis , with consequent cell death .
Leucovorin ( folinic acid ) is readily transported into mammalian cells by an active , carrier ‑ mediated process and can be assimilated into cellular folate pools following its metabolism .
In vitro studies have shown that leucovorin provides a source of reduced folates necessary for normal cellular biosynthetic processes .
Because the Pneumocystis carinii organism lacks the reduced folate carrier - mediated transport system , leucovorin is prevented from entering the organism .
Therefore , at concentrations achieved with therapeutic doses of trimetrexate plus leucovorin , the selective transport of trimetrexate , but not leucovorin , into the Pneumocystis carinii organism allows the concurrent administration of leucovorin to protect normal host cells from the cytotoxicity of trimetrexate without inhibiting the antifolate ' s inhibition of Pneumocystis carinii .
It is not known if considerably higher doses of leucovorin would affect trimetrexate ' s effect on Pneumocystis carinii .
Microbiology Trimetrexate inhibits , in a dose - related manner , in vitro growth of the trophozoite stage of rat Pneumocystis carinii cultured on human embryonic lung fibroblast cells .
Trimetrexate concentrations between 3 and 54 . 1 μM were shown to inhibit the growth of trophozoites .
Leucovorin alone at a concentration of 10 μM did not alter either the growth of the trophozoites or the anti - pneumocystis activity of trimetrexate .
Resistance to trimetrexate ' s antimicrobial activity against Pneumocystis carinii has not been studied .
Pharmacokinetics Trimetrexate pharmacokinetics were assessed in six patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) who had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( 4 patients ) or toxoplasmosis ( 2 patients ) .
Trimetrexate was administered intravenously as a bolus injection at a dose of 30 mg / m2 / day along with leucovorin 20 mg / m2 every 6 hours for 21 days .
Trimetrexate clearance ( mean ± SD ) was 38 ± 15 mL / min / m2 and volume of distribution at steady state ( Vdss ) was 20 ± 8 L / m2 .
The plasma concentration time profile declined in a biphasic manner over 24 hours with a terminal half - life of 11 ± 4 hours .
The pharmacokinetics of trimetrexate without the concomitant administration of leucovorin have been evaluated in cancer patients with advanced solid tumors using various dosage regimens .
The decline in plasma concentrations over time has been described by either biexponential or triexponential equations .
Following the single - dose administration of 10 to 130 mg / m2 to 37 patients , plasma concentrations were obtained for 72 hours .
Nine plasma concentration time profiles were described as biexponential .
The alpha phase half - life was 57 ± 28 minutes , followed by a terminal phase with a half - life of 16 ± 3 hours .
The plasma concentrations in the remaining patients exhibited a triphasic decline with half - lives of 8 . 6 ± 6 . 5 minutes , 2 . 4 ± 1 . 3 hours , and 17 . 8 ± 8 . 2 hours .
Trimetrexate clearance in cancer patients has been reported as 53 ± 41 mL / min ( 14 patients ) and 32 ± 18 mL / min / m2 ( 23 patients ) following single - dose administration .
After a five - day infusion of trimetrexate to 16 patients , plasma clearance was 30 ± 8 mL / min / m2 .
Renal clearance of trimetrexate in cancer patients has varied from about 4 ± 2 mL / min / m2 to 10 ± 6 mL / min / m2 .
Ten to 30 % of the administered dose is excreted unchanged in the urine .
Considering the free fraction of trimetrexate , active tubular secretion may possibly contribute to the renal clearance of trimetrexate .
Renal clearance has been associated with urine flow , suggesting the possibility of tubular reabsorption as well .
The Vdss of trimetrexate in cancer patients after single - dose administration and for whom plasma concentrations were obtained for 72 hours was 36 . 9 ± 17 . 6 L / m2 ( n = 23 ) and 0 . 62 ± 0 . 24 L / kg ( n = 14 ) .
Following a constant infusion of trimetrexate for five days , Vdss was 32 . 8 ± 16 . 6 L / m2 .
The volume of the central compartment has been estimated as 0 . 17 ± 0 . 08 L / kg and 4 . 0 ± 2 . 9 L / m2 .
There have been inconsistencies in the reporting of trimetrexate protein binding .
The in vitro plasma protein binding of trimetrexate using ultrafiltration is approximately 95 % over the concentration range of 18 . 75 to 1000 ng / mL .
There is a suggestion of capacity limited binding ( saturable binding ) at concentrations greater than about 1000 ng / mL , with free fraction progressively increasing to about 9 . 3 % as concentration is increased to 15 μg / mL .
Other reports have declared trimetrexate to be greater than 98 % bound at concentrations of 0 . 1 to 10 μg / mL ; however , specific free fractions were not stated .
The free fraction of trimetrexate also has been reported to be about 15 to 16 % at a concentration of 60 ng / mL , increasing to about 20 % at a trimetrexate concentration of 6 μg / mL .
Trimetrexate metabolism in man has not been characterized .
Preclinical data strongly suggest that the major metabolic pathway is oxidative O - demethylation , followed by conjugation to either glucuronide or the sulfate .
N - demethylation and oxidation is a related minor pathway .
Preliminary findings in humans indicate the presence of a glucuronide conjugate with DHFR inhibition and a demethylated metabolite in urine .
The presence of metabolite ( s ) in human plasma following the administration of trimetrexate is suggested by the differences seen in trimetrexate plasma concentrations when measured by HPLC and a nonspecific DHFR inhibition assay .
The profiles are similar initially , but diverge with time ; concentrations determined by DHFR being higher than those determined by HPLC .
This suggests the presence of one or more metabolites with DHFR inhibition activity .
After intravenous administration of trimetrexate to humans , urinary recovery averaged about 40 % , using a DHFR assay , in comparison to 10 % urinary recovery as determined by HPLC , suggesting the presence of one or more metabolites that retain inhibitory activity against DHFR .
Fecal recovery of trimetrexate over 48 hours after intravenous administration ranged from 0 . 09 to 7 . 6 % of the dose as determined by DHFR inhibition and 0 . 02 to 5 . 2 % of the dose as determined by HPLC .
The pharmacokinetics of trimetrexate have not been determined in patients with renal insufficiency or hepatic dysfunction .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Neutrexin ( trimetrexate glucuronate for injection ) with concurrent leucovorin administration ( leucovorin protection ) is indicated as an alternative therapy for the treatment of moderate - to - severe Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) in immunocompromised patients , including patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , who are intolerant of , or are refractory to , trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole therapy or for whom trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole is contraindicated .
This indication is based on the results of a randomized , controlled double - blind trial comparing Neutrexin with concurrent leucovorin protection ( TMTX / LV ) to trimethoprim ‑ sulfamethoxazole ( TMP / SMX ) in patients with moderate - to - severe Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia , as well as results of a Treatment IND .
These studies are summarized below : Neutrexin Comparative Study with TMP / SMX This double - blind , randomized trial initiated by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group ( ACTG ) in 1988 was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of TMTX / LV to that of TMP / SMX for the treatment of histologically confirmed , moderate - to - severe PCP , defined as ( A - a ) baseline gradient > 30 mmHg , in patients with AIDS .
Of the 220 patients with histologically confirmed PCP , 109 were randomized to receive TMTX / LV and 111 to TMP / SMX .
Study patients randomized to TMTX / LV treatment were to receive 45 mg / m2 of TMTX daily for 21 days plus 20 mg / m2 of LV every 6 hours for 24 days .
Those randomized to TMP / SMX were to receive 5 mg / kg TMP plus 25 mg / kg SMX four times daily for 21 days .
Response to therapy , defined as alive and off ventilatory support at completion of therapy , with no change in anti - pneumocystis therapy , or addition of supraphysiologic doses of steroids , occurred in fifty percent of patients in each treatment group .
The observed mortality in the TMTX / LV treatment group was approximately twice that in the TMP / SMX treatment group ( 95 % CI : 0 . 99 - 4 . 11 ) .
Thirty of 109 ( 27 % ) patients treated with TMTX / LV and 18 of 111 ( 16 % ) patients receiving TMP / SMX died during the 21 - day treatment course or 4 - week follow - up period .
Twenty - seven of 30 deaths in the TMTX / LV arm were attributed to PCP ; all 18 deaths in the TMP / SMX arm were attributed to PCP .
A significantly smaller proportion of patients who received TMTX / LV compared to TMP / SMX failed therapy due to toxicity ( 10 % vs . 25 % ) , and a significantly greater proportion of patients failed due to lack of efficacy ( 40 % vs . 24 % ) .
Six patients ( 12 % ) who responded to TMTX / LV relapsed during the one - month follow - up period ; no patient responding to TMP / SMX relapsed during this period .
Information is not available as to whether these patients received prophylaxis therapy for PCP .
Treatment IND The FDA granted a Treatment IND for Neutrexin with leucovorin protection in February 1988 to make Neutrexin therapy available to HIV - infected patients with histologically confirmed PCP who had disease refractory to or who were intolerant of TMP / SMX and / or intravenous pentamidine .
Over 500 physicians in the United States participated in the Treatment IND .
Of the first 753 patients enrolled , 577 were evaluable for efficacy .
Of these , 227 patients were intolerant of both TMP / SMX and pentamidine ( IST - patients intolerant of both standard therapies ) , 146 were intolerant of one therapy and refractory to the other ( RIST - patients refractory to one therapy and intolerant of the other ) and 204 were refractory to both therapies ( RST - refractory to both standard therapies ) .
This was a very ill patient population ; 38 % required ventilatory support at entry ( Table 1 ) .
These studies did not have concurrent control groups .
TABLE 1 TREATMENT IND Baseline Characteristics IST ( n = 227 ) RIST ( n = 146 ) RST ( n = 204 ) TOTAL ( n = 577 ) Ventilatory Support Required n ( % ) 39 ( 17 ) 50 ( 34 ) 129 ( 63 ) 218 ( 38 ) Median Days on Standard Therapy 10 12 16 14 First Episode of PCP n ( % ) 104 ( 46 ) 103 ( 71 ) 190 ( 93 ) 397 ( 69 ) The overall survival rate one month after completion of TMTX / LV as salvage therapy was 48 % .
Patients who had not responded to treatment with both TMP / SMX and pentamidine , of whom 63 % required mechanical ventilation at entry , achieved a survival rate of 25 % following treatment with TMTX / LV .
Survival was 67 % in patients who were intolerant to both TMP / SMX and pentamidine ( Table 2 ) .
TABLE 2 TREATMENT IND Survival Rate One Month After Completion of Neutrexin Therapy IST RIST RST All Patients 153 / 227 ( 67 % ) 73 / 146 ( 50 % ) 50 / 204 ( 25 % ) Baseline Ventilatory Support 9 / 39 ( 23 % ) 15 / 50 ( 30 % ) 18 / 129 ( 14 % ) No Baseline Ventilatory Support 144 / 188 ( 77 % ) 58 / 96 ( 60 % ) 32 / 75 ( 43 % ) In the Treatment IND , 12 % of the patients discontinued Neutrexin therapy ( with leucovorin protection ) for toxicity .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Neutrexin ( trimetrexate glucuronate for injection ) is contraindicated in patients with clinically significant sensitivity to trimetrexate , leucovorin , or methotrexate .
WARNINGS Neutrexin ( trimetrexate glucuronate for injection ) must be used with concurrent leucovorin to avoid potentially serious or life - threatening complications including bone marrow suppression , oral and gastrointestinal mucosal ulceration , and renal and hepatic dysfunction .
Leucovorin therapy must extend for 72 hours past the last dose of Neutrexin .
Patients should be informed that failure to take the recommended dose and duration of leucovorin can lead to fatal toxicity .
Patients should be closely monitored for the development of serious hematologic adverse reactions ( see PRECAUTIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Neutrexin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Trimetrexate has been shown to be fetotoxic and teratogenic in rats and rabbits .
Rats administered 1 . 5 and 2 . 5 mg / kg / day intravenously on gestational days 6 - 15 showed substantial postimplantation loss and severe inhibition of maternal weight gain .
Trimetrexate administered intravenously to rats at 0 . 5 and 1 . 0 mg / kg / day on gestational days 6 - 15 retarded normal fetal development and was teratogenic .
Rabbits administered trimetrexate intravenously at daily doses of 2 . 5 and 5 . 0 mg / kg / day on gestational days 6 - 18 resulted in significant maternal and fetal toxicity .
In rabbits , trimetrexate at 0 . 1 mg / kg / day was teratogenic in the absence of significant maternal toxicity .
These effects were observed using doses 1 / 20 to 1 / 2 the equivalent human therapeutic dose based on a mg / m2 basis .
Teratogenic effects included skeletal , visceral , ocular , and cardiovascular abnormalities .
If Neutrexin is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus .
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant .
PRECAUTIONS General Patients receiving Neutrexin ( trimetrexate glucuronate for injection ) may experience severe hematologic , hepatic , renal , and gastrointestinal toxicities .
Caution should be used in treating patients with impaired hematologic , renal , or hepatic function .
Patients who require concomitant therapy with nephrotoxic , myelosuppressive , or hepatotoxic drugs should be treated with Neutrexin at the discretion of the physician and monitored carefully .
To allow for full therapeutic doses of Neutrexin , treatment with zidovudine should be discontinued during Neutrexin therapy .
Neutrexin - associated myelosuppression , stomatitis , and gastrointestinal toxicities generally can be ameliorated by adjusting the dose of leucovorin .
Mild elevations in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase have been observed with Neutrexin administration and are usually not cause for modification of Neutrexin therapy ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Seizures have been reported rarely ( < 1 % ) in AIDS patients receiving Neutrexin ; however , a causal relationship has not been established .
Trimetrexate is a known inhibitor of histamine metabolism .
Hypersensitivity / allergic type reactions including but not limited to rash , chills / rigors , fever , diaphoresis and dypsnea have occurred with trimetrexate primarily when it is administered as a bolus infusion or at doses higher than those recommended for PCP , and most frequently in combination with 5 FU and leucovorin .
In rare cases , anaphylactoid reactions , including acute hypotension and loss of consciousness have occurred .
Neutrexin infusion should be permanently discontinued in all patients with severe hypersensitivity reactions .
Epinephrine should be available for treatment of acute allergic symptoms .
Neutrexin has not been evaluated clinically for the treatment of concurrent pulmonary conditions such as bacterial , viral , or fungal pneumonia or mycobacterial diseases .
In vitro activity has been observed against Toxoplasma gondii , Mycobacterium avium complex , gram positive cocci , and gram negative rods .
If clinical deterioration is observed in patients , they should be carefully evaluated for other possible causes of pulmonary disease and treated with additional agents as appropriate .
Laboratory Tests Patients receiving Neutrexin with leucovorin protection should be seen frequently by a physician .
Blood tests to assess the following parameters should be performed at least twice a week during therapy : hematology ( absolute neutrophil counts [ ANC ] , platelets ) , renal function ( serum creatinine , BUN ) , and hepatic function ( AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase ) .
Drug Interactions Since trimetrexate is metabolized by a P450 enzyme system , drugs that induce or inhibit this drug metabolizing enzyme system may elicit important drug - drug interactions that may alter trimetrexate plasma concentrations .
Agents that might be coadministered with trimetrexate in AIDS patients for other indications that could elicit this activity include erythromycin , rifampin , rifabutin , ketoconazole , and fluconazole .
In vitro perfusion of isolated rat liver has shown that cimetidine caused a significant reduction in trimetrexate metabolism and that acetaminophen altered the relative concentration of trimetrexate metabolites possibly by competing for sulfate metabolites .
Based on an in vitro rat liver model , nitrogen substituted imidazole drugs ( clotrimazole , ketoconazole , miconazole ) were potent , non - competitive inhibitors of trimetrexate metabolism .
Patients medicated with these drugs and trimetrexate should be carefully monitored .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of trimetrexate have not been performed .
Mutagenesis Trimetrexate was not mutagenic when tested using the standard Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay with and without metabolic activation .
Trimetrexate did not induce mutations in Chinese hamster lung cells or sister - chromatid exchange in Chinese hamster ovary cells .
Trimetrexate did induce an increase in the chromosomal aberration frequency of cultured Chinese hamster lung cells ; however , trimetrexate showed no clastogenic activity in a mouse micronucleus assay .
Impairment of fertility No studies have been conducted to evaluate the potential of trimetrexate to impair fertility .
However , during standard toxicity studies conducted in mice and rats , degeneration of the testes and spermatocytes including the arrest of spermatogenesis was observed .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects See WARNINGS .
Pregnancy Category D Nursing Mothers It is not known if trimetrexate is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from trimetrexate , it is recommended that breast feeding be discontinued if the mother is treated with Neutrexin .
Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Neutrexin for the treatment of histologically confirmed PCP has not been established for patients under 18 years of age .
Two children , ages 15 months and 9 months , were treated with trimetrexate and leucovorin using a dose of 45 mg / m2 of trimetrexate per day for 21 days and 20 mg / m2 of leucovorin every 6 hours for 24 days .
There were no serious or unexpected adverse effects .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Because many patients who participated in clinical trials of Neutrexin ( trimetrexate glucuronate for injection ) had complications of advanced HIV disease , it is difficult to distinguish adverse events caused by Neutrexin from those resulting from underlying medical conditions .
Table 3 lists the adverse events that occurred in ≥ 1 % of the patients who participated in the Comparative Study of Neutrexin plus leucovorin versus TMP / SMX .

OVERDOSAGE Neutrexin ( trimetrexate glucuronate for injection ) administered without concurrent leucovorin can cause lethal complications .
There has been no extensive experience in humans receiving single intravenous doses of trimetrexate greater than 90 mg / m2 / day with concurrent leucovorin .
The toxicities seen at this dose were primarily hematologic .
In the event of overdose , Neutrexin should be stopped and leucovorin should be administered at a dose of 40 mg / m2 every 6 hours for 3 days .
The LD50 of intravenous trimetrexate in mice is 62 mg / kg ( 186 mg / m2 ) .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Caution : Neutrexin ( trimetrexate glucuronate for injection ) must be administered with concurrent leucovorin ( leucovorin protection ) to avoid potentially serious or life - threatening toxicities .
Leucovorin therapy must extend for 72 hours past the last dose of Neutrexin .
Neutrexin ( trimetrexate glucuronate for injection ) is administered at a dose of 45 mg / m2 once daily by intravenous infusion over 60 minutes .
Leucovorin must be administered daily during treatment with Neutrexin and for 72 hours past the last dose of Neutrexin .
Leucovorin may be administered intravenously at a dose of 20 mg / m2 over 5 to 10 minutes every 6 hours for a total daily dose of 80 mg / m2 , or orally as 4 doses of 20 mg / m2 spaced equally throughout the day .
The oral dose should be rounded up to the next higher 25 mg increment .
The recommended course of therapy is 21 days of Neutrexin and 24 days of leucovorin .
Neutrexin and leucovorin may alternatively be dosed on a mg / kg basis , depending on the patient ’ s body weight , using the conversion factors shown in the table below : Body Weight ( kg ) Neutrexin Dose ( mg / kg / day ) Leucovorin Dose ( mg / kg / qid ) < 50 1 . 5 0 . 6 50 - 80 1 . 2 0 . 5 > 80 1 . 0 0 . 5 Dosage Modifications Hematologic toxicity : Neutrexin ( trimetrexate glucuronate for injection ) and leucovorin doses should be modified based on the worst hematologic toxicity according to the following table .
If leucovorin is given orally , doses should be rounded up to the next higher 25 mg increment .

Leucovorin ( 40 mg / m2 , q6h ) should be administered for an additional 72 hours .
If Grade 4 hematologic toxicity occurs at Day 10 or later , Neutrexin may be held up to 96 hours to allow counts to recover .
If counts recover to Grade 3 within 96 hours , Neutrexin should be administered at a dose of 22 mg / m2 and leucovorin maintained at 40 mg / m2 , q6h .
When counts recover to Grade 2 toxicity , Neutrexin dose may be increased to 45 mg / m2 , but the leucovorin dose should be maintained at 40 mg / m2 for the duration of treatment .
If counts do not improve to ≤ Grade 3 toxicity within 96 hours , Neutrexin should be discontinued .
Leucovorin at a dose of 40 mg / m2 , q6h should be administered for 72 hours following the last dose of Neutrexin .
Hepatic toxicity : Transient elevations of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase have been observed in patients treated with Neutrexin .
Interruption of treatment is advisable if transaminase levels or alkaline phosphatase levels increase to > 5 times the upper limit of normal range .
Renal toxicity : Interruption of Neutrexin is advisable if serum creatinine levels increase to > 2 . 5 mg / dL and the elevation is considered to be secondary to Neutrexin .
Other toxicities : Interruption of treatment is advisable in patients who experience severe mucosal toxicity that interferes with oral intake .
Treatment should be discontinued for fever ( oral temperature ≥ 105 ° F / 40 . 5 ° C ) that cannot be controlled with antipyretics .
Leucovorin therapy must extend for 72 hours past the last dose of Neutrexin .
RECONSTITUTION AND DILUTION Each vial of Neutrexin ( trimetrexate glucuronate for injection ) should be reconstituted in accordance with labeled instructions with either 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP , or Sterile Water for Injection , USP , to yield a concentration of 12 . 5 mg of trimetrexate per mL ( complete dissolution should occur within 30 seconds ) .
The reconstituted product will appear as a pale greenish - yellow solution and must be inspected visually prior to dilution .
Do not use if cloudiness or precipitate is observed .
Neutrexin should not be reconstituted with solutions containing either chloride ion or leucovorin , since precipitation occurs instantly .
After reconstitution , the solution should be used immediately ; however , the solution is stable for 6 hours at room temperature ( 20 to 25ºC ) , or 24 hours under refrigeration ( 2 - 8 ° C ) .
Prior to administration , the reconstituted solution should be further diluted with 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP , to yield a final concentration of 0 . 25 to 2 mg of trimetrexate per mL .
