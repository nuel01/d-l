( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg is contraindicated in women with the following : • Hypersensitivity to gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) , GnRH agonist analogs , including leuprolide acetate , or any of the excipients in LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] • Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding • Pregnancy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] When norethindrone acetate is administered with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg , the contraindications to the use of norethindrone acetate also apply to this combination regimen .
Refer to the norethindrone acetate prescribing information for a list of contraindications for norethindrone acetate .
• Hypersensitivity to GnRH , GnRH agonist analogs , including leuprolide acetate , or any of the excipients in LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg .
( 4 , 5 . 3 ) • Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding .
( 4 ) • Pregnancy .
( 4 , 8 . 1 ) If LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg is administered with norethindrone acetate , the contraindications for norethindrone acetate also apply .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Loss of bone mineral density ( BMD ) : Duration of treatment is limited by risk of bone mineral density .
When using for management of endometriosis : combination use with norethindrone acetate is effective in reducing loss of BMD ; do not retreat without combination norethindrone acetate .
Assess BMD before retreatment .
( 1 . 1 , 1 . 2 , 5 . 1 ) • Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : May cause fetal harm .
Exclude pregnancy before initiating treatment if clinically indicated and discontinue use if pregnancy occurs .
Use non - hormonal methods of contraception only .
( 5 . 2 ) • Hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis , have been reported with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg .
( 5 . 3 ) • If LUPRON is administered with norethindrone acetate , the warnings and precautions for norethindrone acetate apply to the combination regimen .
( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Loss of Bone Mineral Density LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg induces a hypoestrogenic state that results in loss of bone mineral density ( BMD ) , some of which may not be reversible after stopping treatment .
In women with major risk factors for decreased BMD such as chronic alcohol use ( > 3 units per day ) , tobacco use , strong family history of osteoporosis , or chronic use of drugs that can decrease BMD , such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids , use of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg may pose an additional risk .
Carefully weigh the risks and benefits of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg use in these populations .
The duration of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg treatment is limited by the risk of loss of bone mineral density [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
When using LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg for the management of endometriosis , combination use of norethindrone acetate ( add - back therapy ) is effective in reducing the loss of BMD that occurs with leuprolide acetate [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Do not retreat with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg without combination norethindrone acetate .
Assess BMD before retreatment .
5 . 2 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on animal reproduction studies and the drug ’ s mechanism of action , LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg may cause fetal harm if administered to a pregnant woman and is contraindicated in pregnant women .
Exclude pregnancy prior to initiating treatment with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg if clinically indicated .
Discontinue LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg if the woman becomes pregnant during treatment and inform the woman of potential risk to the fetus [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise women to notify their healthcare provider if they believe they may be pregnant .
When used at the recommended dose and dosing interval , LUPRON DEPOT 11 . 25 mg usually inhibits ovulation and stops menstruation .
Contraception , however , is not ensured by taking LUPRON DEPOT 11 . 25 mg .
If contraception is indicated , advise women to use non - hormonal methods of contraception while on treatment with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg .
5 . 3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis , have been reported with LUPRON DEPOT use .
LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg is contraindicated in women with a history of hypersensitivity to gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) or GnRH agonist analogs [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) andAdverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
In clinical trials of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg , adverse events of asthma were reported in women with pre - existing histories of asthma , sinusitis , and environmental or drug allergies .
Symptoms consistent with an anaphylactoid or asthmatic process have been reported postmarketing .
5 . 4 Initial Flare of Symptoms Following the first dose of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg , sex steroids temporarily rise above baseline because of the physiologic effect of the drug .
Therefore , an increase in symptoms may be observed during the initial days of therapy , but these should dissipate with continued therapy .
5 . 5 Convulsions There have been postmarketing reports of convulsions in women on GnRH agonists , including leuprolide acetate .
These included women with and without concurrent medications and comorbid conditions .
5 . 6 Clinical Depression Depression may occur or worsen during treatment with GnRH agonists including LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Carefully observe women for depression , especially those with a history of depression and consider whether the risks of continuing LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg outweigh the benefits .
Women with new or worsening depression should be referred to a mental health professional , as appropriate .
5 . 7 Risks Associated with Norethindrone Combination Treatment If LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg is administered with norethindrone acetate , the warnings and precautions for norethindrone acetate apply to this regimen .
Refer to the norethindrone acetate prescribing information for a full list of the warnings and precautions for norethindrone acetate .

In one controlled clinical trial utilizing the monthly formulation of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg and LUPRON DEPOT 7 . 5 mg in women diagnosed with uterine fibroids received one injection every 4 weeks for a duration of 12 weeks .
Adverse reactions of galactorrhea , pyelonephritis , and urinary incontinence were reported in the 7 . 5 mg dose group but not in the 3 . 75 mg dose group .
Generally , a higher incidence of hypoestrogenic effects was observed at the higher dose .
LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg in combination with Norethindrone Acetate 5 mg The safety of co - administering LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg and norethindrone acetate was evaluated in two clinical studies in which a total of 242 women with endometriosis were treated for up to one year .
Women were treated with monthly IM injections of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg ( 13 injections ) alone or monthly IM injections of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg ( 13 injections ) plus norethindrone acetate 5 mg daily .
The population age range was 17 to 43 years old .
The majority of women were Caucasian ( 87 % ) .
In one study , 106 women were randomized to one year of treatment with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg alone or with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg and norethindrone acetate .
The other study was an open - label , single arm clinical study in 136 women on one year of treatment with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg plus norethindrone acetate , with follow - up for up to 12 months after completing treatment .
Adverse Reactions ( > 1 % ) Leading to Study Discontinuation In the controlled study , 18 % of women treated monthly with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg and 18 % of women treated monthly with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg plus norethindrone acetate discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions , most commonly hot flashes ( 6 % ) and insomnia ( 4 % ) in the LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg alone group and hot flashes and emotional lability ( 4 % each ) in the LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg plus norethindrone group .
In the open - label study , 13 % of women treated monthly with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg plus norethindrone acetate discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions , most commonly depression ( 4 % ) and acne ( 2 % ) .
Common Adverse Reactions Table 4 lists the adverse reactions observed in at least 5 % of women in any treatment group , during the first 6 months of treatment in the two add - back clinical studies , in which women were treated with monthly LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg with or without norethindrone acetate 5 mg daily co - treatment .
The most frequently - occurring adverse reactions observed in these studies were hot flashes and headaches .

Serious Adverse Reactions Urinary tract infection ( 1 . 9 % ) , renal calculus ( 0 . 7 % ) , depression ( 0 . 7 % ) Changes in Laboratory Values during Treatment Liver Enzymes Three percent of women with uterine fibroids treated with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg , manifested post - treatment transaminase values that were at least twice the baseline value and above the upper limit of the normal range .
In the two clinical trials of women with endometriosis , 2 % ( 4 of 191 ) women receiving leuprolide acetate plus norethindrone acetate for up to 12 months developed an elevated ( at least twice the upper limit of normal ) SGPT and 1 % ( 2 of 136 ) developed an elevated GGT .
Among these six women with increased liver tests , the increases in five were observed beyond 6 months of treatment .
None were associated with an elevated bilirubin concentration .
Lipids Triglycerides were increased above the upper limit of normal in 12 % of the women with endometriosis who received LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg .
Of those women with endometriosis and women with uterine fibroid whose pretreatment cholesterol values were in the normal range , mean change following therapy was + 16 mg / dL to + 17 mg / dL in women with endometriosis and + 11 mg / dL to + 29 mg / dL in women with uterine fibroids .
In the women with endometriosis , increases from the pretreatment values were statistically significant ( p < 0 . 03 ) .
There was essentially no increase in the LDL / HDL ratio in women from either population receiving LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg .
Percent changes from baseline for serum lipids and percentages of women with serum lipid values outside of the normal range in the two studies of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg and norethindrone acetate are summarized in Table 6 and Table 7 below .
The major impact of adding norethindrone acetate to treatment with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg was a decrease in serum HDL cholesterol and an increase in the LDL / HDL ratio .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of LUPRON DEPOT monotherapy or LUPRON DEPOT with norethindrone acetate add - back therapy .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
During postmarketing surveillance which includes other dosage forms and other populations , the following adverse reactions were reported : • Body as a whole : Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis , localized reactions including induration and abscess at the site of injection • Nervous / Psychiatric System : Mood swings , including depression ; suicidal ideation and attempt ; convulsion , peripheral neuropathy , paralysis • Hepato - biliary system : Serious liver injury • Injury , poisoning and procedural complications : Spinal fracture • Investigations : Decreased white blood count • Musculoskeletal and connective tissue system : Tenosynovitis - like symptoms • Vascular system : Hypotension , hypertension , deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , myocardial infarction , stroke , transient ischemic attack • Respiratory system : Symptoms consistent with an asthmatic process • Multi - system disorders : Symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia ( e . g . , joint and muscle pain , headaches , sleep disorders , gastrointestinal distress , and shortness of breath ) , individually and collectively .
Pituitary apoplexy During postmarketing surveillance , cases of pituitary apoplexy ( a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland ) have been reported after the administration of leuprolide acetate and other GnRH agonists .
In a majority of these cases , a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed , with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose , and some within the first hour .
In these cases , pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache , vomiting , visual changes , ophthalmoplegia , altered mental status , and sometimes cardiovascular collapse .
Immediate medical attention has been required .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug - drug interaction studies have been conducted with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg is contraindicated in pregnancy [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg may cause fetal harm based on findings from animal studies and the drug ’ s mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are limited human data on the use of LUPRON DEPOT in pregnant women .
Based on animal reproduction studies , LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg may be associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications , including early pregnancy loss and fetal harm .
In animal reproduction studies , subcutaneous administration of leuprolide acetate to rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused embryo - fetal toxicity , decreased fetal weights and a dose - dependent increase in major fetal abnormalities in animals at doses less than the recommended human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose .
A similar rat study also showed increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights but no major fetal abnormalities at doses less than the recommended human dose based on body surface area using an estimated daily dose [ see Data ] .
Data Animal Data When administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 0 . 00024 mg / kg , 0 . 0024 mg / kg , and 0 . 024 mg / kg ( 1 / 300 to 1 / 3 of the human dose ) to rabbits , leuprolide acetate produced a dose - related increase in major fetal abnormalities .
Similar studies in rats failed to demonstrate an increase in fetal malformations .
There was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of LUPRON DEPOT in rabbits and with the highest dose ( 0 . 024 mg / kg ) in rats .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of leuprolide acetate in either animal or human milk , the effects on the breastfed infants , or the effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Exclude pregnancy in women of reproductive potential prior to initiating LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg if clinically indicated [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Contraception Females LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg may cause embryo - fetal harm when administered during pregnancy .
LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg is not a contraceptive .
If contraception is indicated , advise females of reproductive potential to use a non - hormonal method of contraception during treatment with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Infertility Based on its pharmacodynamic effects of decreasing secretion of gonadal steroids , fertility is expected to be decreased while on treatment with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg .
Clinical and pharmacologic studies in adults ( > 18 years ) with leuprolide acetate and similar analogs have shown reversibility of fertility suppression when the drug is discontinued after continuous administration for periods of up to 24 weeks [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There is no evidence that pregnancy rates are affected following discontinuation of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg .
Animal studies ( prepubertal and adult rats and monkeys ) with leuprolide acetate and other GnRH analogs have shown functional recovery of fertility suppression .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg for management of endometriosis and the preoperative hematologic improvement of women with anemia caused by fibroids have been established in females of reproductive age .
Efficacy is expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 18 as for users 18 years and older .
The safety and effectiveness of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg for these indications have not been established in premenarcheal pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg is not indicated in postmenopausal women and has not been studied in this population .
11 DESCRIPTION Leuprolide acetate is a synthetic nonapeptide analog of gonadotropin - releasing hormone [ GnRH or luteinizing hormone releasing hormone ( LH - RH ) ] , a GnRH agonist .
The chemical name is 5 - oxo - L - prolyl - L - histidyl - L - tryptophyl - L - seryl - L - tyrosyl - D - leucyl - L - leucyl - L - arginyl - N - ethyl - L - prolinamide acetate ( salt ) with the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg ( leuprolide acetate for depot suspension for injection ) is available in a prefilled dual - chamber syringe containing sterile lyophilized microspheres powder which , when mixed with diluent , become a suspension intended as an IM injection .
The front chamber of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg prefilled dual - chamber syringe contains leuprolide acetate for depot suspension ( 3 . 75 mg ) , purified gelatin ( 0 . 65 mg ) , DL - lactic and glycolic acids copolymer ( 33 . 1 mg ) and D - mannitol ( 6 . 6 mg ) .
The second chamber of diluent contains carboxymethylcellulose sodium ( 5 mg ) , D - mannitol ( 50 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 1 mg ) , water for injection , USP , and glacial acetic acid , USP to control pH . During the manufacture of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg , acetic acid is lost , leaving the peptide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Leuprolide acetate is a long - acting GnRH analog .
A single monthly injection of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg results in an initial stimulation followed by a prolonged suppression of pituitary gonadotropins .
Repeated dosing of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg at monthly intervals results in decreased secretion of gonadal steroid .
Consequently , tissues and functions that depend on gonadal steroids for their maintenance become quiescent .
This effect is reversible on discontinuation of drug therapy .
Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Administration of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary - gonadal system .
Normal function is usually restored within three months after treatment is discontinued .
Therefore , diagnostic tests of pituitary gonadotropic and gonadal functions conducted during treatment and for up to three months after discontinuation of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg may be affected .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following a single IM injection of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg in healthy female volunteers , absorption of leuprolide was characterized by an initial increase in plasma concentration , with peak concentration ranging from 4 . 6 to 10 . 2 ng / mL at four hours postdosing .
However , intact leuprolide and an inactive metabolite could not be distinguished by the assay used in the study .
Following the initial rise , leuprolide concentrations started to plateau within two days after dosing and remained relatively stable for about four to five weeks with plasma concentrations of about 0 . 30 ng / mL .
Distribution The mean steady - state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L .
In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43 % to 49 % .
Metabolism Leuprolide acetate is a peptide that is primarily degraded by peptidase .
In healthy male volunteers , a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 7 . 6 L / h , with a terminal elimination half - life of approximately 3 hours based on a two - compartment model .
The major metabolite ( M - I , a pentapeptide ) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6 % of the peak parent drug concentration .
One week after dosing , mean plasma M - I concentrations were approximately 20 % of mean leuprolide concentrations .
Excretion Following administration of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg to 3 patients , less than 5 % of the dose was recovered as parent and M - I metabolite in the urine .
Use in Specific Populations The pharmacokinetics of LUPRON DEPOT have not been evaluated in patients with hepatic and renal impairment .
Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic drug - drug interaction studies have been conducted with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg .
However , leuprolide acetate is a peptide that is not degraded by cytochrome P - 450 enzymes ; hence , drug interactions associated with cytochrome P - 450 enzymes would not be expected to occur .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility A two - year carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats and mice .
In rats , a dose - related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses ( 0 . 6 to 4 mg / kg ) .
There was a significant but not dose - related increase of pancreatic islet - cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males ( highest incidence in the low dose group ) .
In mice , no leuprolide acetate - induced tumors or pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg / kg for two years .
Patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg / day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg / day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities .
Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems .
These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg for the indicated populations has been established based on adequate and well - controlled studies in adults ( See Table 8 ) of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 1 Endometriosis LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg Monotherapy In controlled clinical studies , LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg monthly for six months was shown to be comparable to danazol 800 mg / day in relieving the clinical sign / symptoms of endometriosis ( pelvic pain , dysmenorrhea , dyspareunia , pelvic tenderness , and induration ) and in reducing the size of endometrial implants as evidenced by laparoscopy .
The clinical significance of a decrease in endometriotic lesions is not known , and laparoscopic staging of endometriosis does not necessarily correlate with the severity of symptoms .
LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg monthly induced amenorrhea in 74 % and 98 % of the women after the first and second month of treatment , respectively .
Most of the remaining women reported episodes of only light bleeding or spotting .
In the first , second and third post - treatment months , normal menstrual cycles resumed in 7 % , 71 % and 95 % of women , respectively , excluding those who became pregnant .
Figure 1 illustrates the percent of women with symptoms at baseline , final treatment visit and sustained relief at 6 and 12 months following discontinuation of treatment for the various symptoms evaluated during the two controlled clinical studies .
A total of 166 women received LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg .
Seventy - five percent ( N = 125 ) of these elected to participate in the follow - up period .
Of these women , 36 % and 24 % are included in the 6 - month and 12 - month follow - up analysis , respectively .
All the women who had a pain evaluation at baseline and at least of one treatment visit are included in the Baseline ( B ) and final treatment visit ( F ) analysis .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] LUPRON DEPOT with Norethindrone Acetate Add - Back Therapy Two clinical studies with treatment duration of 12 months were conducted to evaluate the effect of co - administration of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg and norethindrone acetate on the loss of bone mineral density ( BMD ) associated with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg and on the efficacy of LUPRON DEPOT in relieving symptoms of endometriosis .
All women in these studies received calcium supplementation with 1000 mg elemental calcium .
A total of 242 women were treated with monthly administration of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg ( 13 injections ) and 191 of them were co - administered 5 mg norethindrone acetate taken daily .
The population age range was 17 - 43 years old .
The majority of women were Caucasian ( 87 % ) .
One co - administration study was a controlled , randomized and double - blind study included 51 women treated monthly with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg alone and 55 women treated monthly with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg plus norethindrone acetate daily .
Women in this trial were followed for up to 24 months after completing one year of treatment .
The other study was an open - label single arm clinical study in 136 women of one year of treatment with LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg monthly and daily norethindrone acetate 5 mg , with follow - up for up to 12 months after completing treatment .
See Table 8 .
The assessment of efficacy was based on the investigator ’ s or the woman ’ s monthly assessment of five signs or symptoms of endometriosis ( dysmenorrhea , pelvic pain , deep dyspareunia , pelvic tenderness and pelvic induration ) .
Table 8 below provides detailed efficacy data regarding relief of symptoms of endometriosis based on the two studies of co - administration of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg monthly and norethindrone acetate 5 mg daily .

The median time for menses resumption after treatment with leuprolide acetate and norethindrone acetate was 8 weeks .
Changes in Bone Density The effect of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg and norethindrone acetate on bone mineral density was evaluated by dual energy x - ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan in the two clinical trials .
For the open - label study , success in mitigating BMD loss was defined as the lower bound of the 95 % confidence interval around the change from baseline at one year of treatment not to exceed - 2 . 2 % .
The bone mineral density data of the lumbar spine from these two studies are presented in Table 9 .

14 . 2 Fibroids LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg monthly for a period of three to six months was studied in four controlled clinical trials .
In one of these clinical studies , enrollment was based on hematocrit ≤ 30 % and / or hemoglobin ≤ 10 . 2 g / dL .
Administration of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg monthly , concomitantly with iron , produced an increase of ≥ 6 % hematocrit and ≥ 2 g / dL hemoglobin in 77 % of women at three months of therapy .
The mean change in hematocrit was 10 . 1 % and the mean change in hemoglobin was 4 . 2 g / dL .
Clinical response was judged to be a hematocrit of ≥ 36 % and hemoglobin of ≥ 12 g / dL , thus allowing for autologous blood donation prior to surgery .
At two and three months , respectively , 71 % and 75 % of women met this criterion ( Table 11 ) .
These data suggest however , that some women may benefit from iron alone or 1 to 2 months of LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg .

Episodes of spotting and menstrual - like bleeding were noted in 16 % of women at final visit .
In this same study , a decrease in uterine volume and myoma volume of ≥ 25 % was seen in 60 % and 54 % of women , respectively .
The mean fibroid diameter was 6 . 3 cm at pretreatment and decreased to 5 . 6 cm at the end of treatment .
LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg was found to relieve symptoms of bloating , pelvic pain , and pressure .
In three other controlled clinical trials , enrollment was not based on hematologic status .
Mean uterine volume decreased by 41 % and myoma volume decreased by 37 % at final visit as evidenced by ultrasound or MRI .
The mean fibroid diameter was 5 . 6 cm at pretreatment and decreased to 4 . 7 cm at the end of treatment .
These women also experienced a decrease in symptoms including excessive vaginal bleeding and pelvic discomfort .
Ninety - five percent of these women became amenorrheic with 61 % , 25 % , and 4 % experiencing amenorrhea during the first , second , and third treatment months respectively .
In addition , post - treatment follow - up was carried out in one clinical trial for a small percentage of women on LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg ( N = 46 ) among the 77 % who demonstrated a ≥ 25 % decrease in uterine volume while on therapy .
Menses usually returned within two months of cessation of therapy .
Mean time to return to pretreatment uterine size was 8 . 3 months .
Regrowth did not appear to be related to pretreatment uterine volume .
Changes in Bone Density In one of the studies for fibroids described above , when LUPRON DEPOT 3 . 75 mg was administered for three months in women with uterine fibroids , vertebral trabecular bone mineral density , as assessed by quantitative digital radiography ( QDR ) , revealed a mean decrease of 2 . 7 % compared with baseline .
Six months after discontinuation of therapy , a trend toward recovery was observed .
