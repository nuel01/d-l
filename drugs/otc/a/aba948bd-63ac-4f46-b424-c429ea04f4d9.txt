The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinylchloride .
Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts ; however , biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials .
Exposure to temperatures above 25 ° C / 77 ° F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content .
Higher temperatures lead to greater losses .
It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When administered intravenously , Normosol - R and 5 % Dextrose Injection provides water and electrolytes with carbohydrate calories for replacement of acute extracellular fluid losses without disturbing normal electrolyte relationships .
The electrolyte composition approaches that of the principal ions of normal plasma ( extracellular fluid ) .
The electrolyte concentration is approximately isotonic in relation to the extracellular fluid ( approx .
280 mOsmol / liter ) and provides a physiologic sodium to chloride ratio , normal plasma concentrations of potassium and magnesium and two bicarbonate alternates , acetate and gluconate .
Dextrose provides minimal calories and renders the solution hypertonic .
Solutions containing carbohydrate in the form of dextrose restore blood glucose levels and supply calories .
Carbohydrate in the form of dextrose may aid in minimizing liver glycogen depletion and exerts a protein - sparing action .
Dextrose injected parenterally undergoes oxidation to carbon dioxide and water .
Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium ( Na + ) and chloride ( Cl ‾ ) ions .
Sodium ( Na + ) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances .
Chloride ( Cl ‾ ) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells .
The distribution and excretion of sodium ( Na + ) and chloride ( Cl ‾ ) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output .
Potassium chloride in water dissociates to provide potassium ( K + ) and chloride ( Cl ‾ ) ions .
Potassium is the chief cation of body cells ( 160 mEq / liter of intracellular water ) .
It is found in low concentration in plasma and extracellular fluids ( 3 . 5 to 5 . 0 mEq / liter in a healthy adult and child over 10 days old ; 3 . 5 to 6 . 0 mEq / liter in a child less than 10 days old ) .
Potassium plays an important role in electrolyte balance .
Normally about 80 to 90 % of the potassium intake is excreted in the urine ; the remainder in the stools and to a small extent , in the perspiration .
The kidney does not conserve potassium well so that during fasting or in patients on a potassium - free diet , potassium loss from the body continues resulting in potassium depletion .
Magnesium chloride in water dissociates to provide magnesium ( Mg + + ) and chloride ( Cl ‾ ) ions .
Magnesium is the second most plentiful cation of the intracellular fluids .
It is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability .
Normal plasma concentration ranges from 1 . 5 to 2 . 5 or 3 . 0 mEq per liter .
Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration .
Sodium acetate provides sodium ( Na + ) and acetate ( CH3COO ‾ ) ions , the latter anion ( a source of hydrogen ion acceptors ) serving as an alternate source of bicarbonate ( HCO3 ‾ ) by metabolic conversion in the liver .
This has been shown to proceed readily even in the presence of severe liver disease .
Thus , acetate anion exerts a mild systemic antiacidotic action that may be advantageous during fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy .
Sodium gluconate provides sodium ( Na + ) and gluconate ( C6H1107 ‾ ) ions .
Although gluconate is a theoretical alternate metabolic source of bicarbonate ( HC03 ‾ ) anion , a significant antiacidotic action has not been established .
Thus , the gluconate anion serves primarily to complete the cation - anion balance of the solution .
Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70 % of total body weight .
Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters ( 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production ) .
Average normal pediatric daily requirements are based on the child ’ s weight as described in the table below : Weight Fluid Requirements Up to 10 kg 100 mL / kg 11 to 20 kg 1 , 000 mL + 50 mL / kg for each kg above 10 kg Above 20 kg 1 , 500 mL + 20 mL / kg for each kg above 20 kg Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms .
Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium ( Na + ) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Normosol - R and 5 % Dextrose Injection is indicated for replacement of acute extracellular fluid volume losses in surgery , trauma , burns or shock .
Normosol - R and 5 % Dextrose also can be used as an adjunct to restore a decrease in circulatory volume in patients with moderate blood loss .
The solution is not intended to supplant transfusion of whole blood or packed red cells in the presence of uncontrolled hemorrhage or severe reductions of red cell volume .
CONTRAINDICATIONS None known .
WARNINGS Solutions containing sodium ions should be used with great care , if at all , in patients with congestive heart failure , severe renal insufficiency and in clinical states in which there exists edema with sodium retention .
Solutions which contain potassium should be used with great care , if at all , in patients with hyperkalemia , severe renal failure and in conditions in which potassium retention is present .
In patients with diminished renal function , administration of solutions containing sodium or potassium ions may result in sodium or potassium retention .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function during fluid replacement with Normosol - R and 5 % Dextrose .
Solutions containing acetate or gluconate ions should be used with great care in patients with metabolic or respiratory alkalosis .
Acetate or gluconate should be administered with great care in those conditions in which there is an increased level or an impaired utilization of these ions , such as severe hepatic insufficiency .
The intravenous administration of this solution can cause fluid and / or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
Elderly patients may be at increased risk for the development of fluid overloading and dilutional hyponatremia following Normosol - R and 5 % Dextrose administration .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of administered parenteral solutions .
The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of such solutions .
PRECAUTIONS Normosol - R and 5 % Dextrose Injection should be used with caution in severe renal impairment because of the danger of hyperkalemia .
As with all intravenous solutions , care should be taken to avoid circulatory overload , especially in patients with cardiac or pulmonary disorders .
Normosol - R and 5 % Dextrose is not intended to correct acidosis or large deficits of individual electrolytes , nor to replace blood or plasma expanders when these are indicated .
Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance , electrolyte concentrations and acid - base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation .
Caution must be exercised in the administration of parenteral fluids , especially those containing sodium ions , to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin .
Solutions containing acetate or gluconate ions should be used with caution , as excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis .
Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus .
Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged .
Discard unused portion .
Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Normosol - R and 5 % Dextrose Injection .
It is also not known whether this solution can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
This solution should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population are based on the similarity of the clinical conditions of the pediatric and adult populations .
In neonates or very small infants the volume of fluid may affect fluid and electrolyte balance .
Frequent monitoring of serum glucose concentrations is required when dextrose is prescribed to pediatric patients , particularly neonates and low birth weight infants .
In very low birth weight infants , excessive or rapid administration of dextrose injection may result in increased serum osmolality and possible intracerebral hemorrhage .
Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Normosol - R and 5 % Dextrose did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
Elderly patients have been shown to secrete higher levels of antidiuretic hormone than younger patients , which may increase the risk of fluid overloading , and dilutional hyponatremia in these patients .
( See WARNINGS . )
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
( See WARNINGS . )
ADVERSE REACTIONS Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response , infection at the site of injection , venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection , extravasation and hypervolemia .
If an adverse reaction does occur , discontinue the infusion , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of overhydration or solute overload , re - evaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective measures .
( See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS . )
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Normosol - R and 5 % Dextrose Injection is administered by intravenous infusion .
The amount to be infused is based on replacement of losses of extracellular fluid volume in the individual patient .
Up to 3 times the volume of estimated blood loss during and after surgery can be given to correct circulatory volume when there is only a moderate loss of blood .
As reported in the literature , the dosage and constant infusion rate of intravenous dextrose must be selected with caution in pediatric patients , particularly neonates and low birth weight infants , because of the increased risk of hyperglycemia / hypoglycemia .
