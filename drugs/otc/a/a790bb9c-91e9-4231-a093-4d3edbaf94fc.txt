Hypersensitivity to levalbuterol , racemic albuterol or any other component of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Life - threatening paradoxical bronchospasm may occur .
Discontinue Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol immediately and treat with alternative therapy .
( 5 . 1 ) • • Need for more doses of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol than usual may be a sign of deterioration of asthma and requires reevaluation of treatment .
( 5 . 2 ) • • Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol is not a substitute for corticosteroids .
( 5 . 3 ) • • Cardiovascular effects may occur .
Consider discontinuation of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol if these effects occur .
Use with caution in patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders .
( 5 . 4 ) • • Excessive use may be fatal .
Do not exceed recommended dose .
( 5 . 5 ) • • Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur .
Discontinue Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol immediately .
( 5 . 6 ) • • Hypokalemia and changes in blood glucose may occur .
( 5 . 7 , 5 . 8 ) 5 . 1 Paradoxical Bronchospasm Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol can produce paradoxical bronchospasm , which may be life - threatening .
If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs , Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted .
It should be recognized that paradoxical bronchospasm , when associated with inhaled formulations , frequently occurs with the first use of a new canister .
5 . 2 Deterioration of Asthma Asthma may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer .
If the patient needs more doses of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol than usual , this may be a marker of destabilization of asthma and requires reevaluation of the patient and treatment regimen , giving special consideration to the possible need for anti - inflammatory treatment , e . g . , corticosteroids .
5 . 3 Use of Anti - Inflammatory Agents The use of a beta - adrenergic agonist alone may not be adequate to control asthma in many patients .
Early consideration should be given to adding anti - inflammatory agents , e . g . , corticosteroids , to the therapeutic regimen .
5 . 4 Cardiovascular Effects Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol , like other beta - adrenergic agonists , can produce clinically significant cardiovascular effects in some patients , as measured by heart rate , blood pressure , and symptoms .
Although such effects are uncommon after administration of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol at recommended doses , if they occur , the drug may need to be discontinued .
In addition , beta - agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram ( ECG ) changes , such as flattening of the T - wave , prolongation of the QTc interval , and ST segment depression .
The clinical significance of these findings is unknown .
Therefore , Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol , like all sympathomimetic amines , should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders , especially coronary insufficiency , cardiac arrhythmias , and hypertension .
5 . 5 Do Not Exceed Recommended Dose Fatalities have been reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs in patients with asthma .
The exact cause of death is unknown , but cardiac arrest following an unexpected development of a severe acute asthmatic crisis and subsequent hypoxia is suspected .
5 . 6 Immediate Hypersensitivity Reactions Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur after administration of racemic albuterol , as demonstrated by rare cases of urticaria , angioedema , rash , bronchospasm , anaphylaxis , and oropharyngeal edema .
The potential for hypersensitivity must be considered in the clinical evaluation of patients who experience immediate hypersensitivity reactions while receiving Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol .
5 . 7 Coexisting Conditions Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol , like all sympathomimetic amines , should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders , especially coronary insufficiency , hypertension , and cardiac arrhythmias ; in patients with convulsive disorders , hyperthyroidism , or diabetes mellitus ; and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines .
Clinically significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been seen in individual patients and could be expected to occur in some patients after the use of any beta - adrenergic bronchodilator .
Large doses of intravenous racemic albuterol have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis .
5 . 8 Hypokalemia As with other beta - adrenergic agonist medications , Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients , possibly through intracellular shunting , which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects .
The decrease is usually transient , not requiring supplementation .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Use of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol may be associated with the following : • • Paradoxical bronchospasm [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Cardiovascular effects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • • Immediate hypersensitivity reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • • Hypokalemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 2 % and > placebo ) are accidental injury , bronchitis , dizziness , pain , pharyngitis , rhinitis , and vomiting .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Adults and Adolescents 12 Years of Age and Older Adverse reaction information concerning Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol in adults and adolescents is derived from two 8 - week , multicenter , randomized , double - blind , active - and placebo - controlled trials in 748 adult and adolescent patients with asthma that compared Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol , a marketed albuterol HFA inhaler , and an HFA - 134 a placebo inhaler .
Table 1 lists the incidence of all adverse reactions ( whether considered by the investigator to be related or unrelated to drug ) from these trials that occurred at a rate of 2 % or greater in the group treated with Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol and more frequently than in the HFA - 134 a placebo inhaler group .
Table 1 : Adverse Reaction Incidence ( % of Patients ) in Two 8 - Week Clinical Trials in Adults and Adolescents ≥ 12 Years of Age * Body System Preferred Term Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol 90 mcg ( n = 403 ) Racemic Albuterol HFA 180 mcg ( n = 179 ) Placebo ( n = 166 ) Body as a Whole Pain 4 % 3 % 4 % Central Nervous System Dizziness 3 % 1 % 2 % Respiratory System Asthma 9 % 7 % 6 % Pharyngitis 8 % 2 % 2 % Rhinitis 7 % 2 % 3 % * This table includes all adverse reactions ( whether considered by the investigator to be related or unrelated to drug ) from these trials that occurred at a rate of 2 % or greater in the group treated with Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol and more frequently than in the HFA - 134 a placebo inhaler group .
Adverse reactions reported by less than 2 % and at least 2 or more of the adolescent and adult patients receiving Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol and by a greater proportion than receiving HFA - 134 a placebo inhaler include cyst , flu syndrome , viral infection , constipation , gastroenteritis , myalgia , hypertension , epistaxis , lung disorder , acne , herpes simplex , conjunctivitis , ear pain , dysmenorrhea , hematuria , and vaginal moniliasis .
There were no significant laboratory abnormalities observed in these studies .
Pediatric Patients 4 to 11 Years of Age Adverse reaction information concerning Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol in children is derived from a 4 - week , randomized , double - blind trial of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol , a marketed albuterol HFA inhaler , and an HFA - 134 a placebo inhaler in 150 children aged 4 to 11 years with asthma .
Table 2 lists the adverse reactions reported for Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol in children at a rate of 2 % or greater and more frequently than for placebo .
Table 2 : Adverse Reaction Incidence ( % of Patients ) in a 4 - Week Clinical Trial in Children 4 - 11 Years of Age * Body System Preferred Term Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol 90 mcg ( n = 76 ) Racemic Albuterol HFA 180 mcg ( n = 39 ) Placebo ( n = 35 ) Body as a Whole Accidental injury 9 % 10 % 6 % Digestive System Vomiting 11 % 8 % 6 % Respiratory System Bronchitis 3 % 0 % 0 % Pharyngitis 7 % 13 % 6 % * This table includes all adverse reactions ( whether considered by the investigator to be related or unrelated to drug ) from the trial that occurred at a rate of 2 % or greater in the group treated with Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol and more frequently than in the HFA - 134 a placebo inhaler group .
The incidence of systemic beta - adrenergic adverse reactions ( e . g . , tremor , nervousness ) was low and comparable across all treatment groups , including placebo .
6 . 2 Post - marketing Experience In addition to the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials , the following adverse reactions have been observed in post - approval use of levalbuterol inhalation solution .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
These events have been chosen for inclusion due to their seriousness , their frequency of reporting , or their likely beta - mediated mechanism : angioedema , anaphylaxis , arrhythmias ( including atrial fibrillation , supraventricular tachycardia , extrasystoles ) , asthma , chest pain , cough increased , dysphonia , dyspnea , gastrooesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , metabolic acidosis , nausea , nervousness , rash , tachycardia , tremor , urticaria .
In addition , Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol , like other sympathomimetic agents , can cause adverse reactions such as hypertension , angina , vertigo , central nervous system stimulation , sleeplessness , headache , and drying or irritation of the oropharynx .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Other short - acting sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators or epinephrine should not be used concomitantly with Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol .
If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route , they should be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular effects .
• • Other short - acting sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators and adrenergic drugs : May potentiate effect .
( 7 ) • • Beta - blockers : May block bronchodilatory effects of beta - agonists and produce severe bronchospasm .
Patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta - blockers .
( 7 . 1 ) • • Diuretics : May worsen electrocardiographic changes or hypokalemia associated with diuretics may worsen .
Consider monitoring potassium levels .
( 7 . 2 ) • • Digoxin : May decrease serum digoxin levels .
Consider monitoring digoxin levels .
( 7 . 3 ) • • Monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOs ) or tricyclic antidepressants : May potentiate effect of albuterol on the cardiovascular system .
( 7 . 4 ) 7 . 1 Beta - blockers Beta - blockers : Beta - adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta - adrenergic agonists , such as Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol , but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients .
Therefore , patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta - blockers .
However , under certain circumstances , e . g . , as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction , there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta - adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma .
In this setting , cardioselective beta - blockers should be considered , although they should be administered with caution .
7 . 2 Diuretics The ECG changes or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non - potassium - sparing diuretics ( such as loop and thiazide diuretics ) can be acutely worsened by beta - agonists , especially when the recommended dose of the beta - agonist is exceeded .
Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known , caution is advised in the coadministration of beta - agonists with non - potassium - sparing diuretics .
Consider monitoring potassium levels .
7 . 3 Digoxin Mean decreases of 16 % to 22 % in serum digoxin levels were demonstrated after single - dose intravenous and oral administration of racemic albuterol , respectively , to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days .
The clinical significance of these findings for patients with obstructive airway disease who are receiving Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol and digoxin on a chronic basis is unclear .
Nevertheless , it would be prudent to carefully evaluate the serum digoxin levels in patients who are currently receiving digoxin and Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol .
7 . 4 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants , or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents , because the action of albuterol on the vascular system may be potentiated .
Consider alternative therapy in patients taking MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Rare instances of congenital anomalies , including cleft palate and limb defects , were reported in newborns of women treated with racemic albuterol in which the levalbuterol isomer ( active drug substance of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol ) is present .
However , since multiple medications were taken during their pregnancies and there was no consistent pattern of anomalies , it was not possible to establish a relationship between racemic albuterol use and the occurrence of these congenital anomalies .
In animal studies , oral administration of levalbuterol HCl to pregnant New Zealand White rabbits found no evidence of teratogenicity at doses up to 25 mg / kg / day ( approximately 750 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose of levalbuterol tartrate for adults on a mg / m2 basis ) .
However , other studies demonstrated that racemic albuterol sulfate was teratogenic in mice and rabbits at doses slightly higher than the human therapeutic range .
Pregnant mice administered racemic albuterol sulfate subcutaneously resulted in a dose - related increased incidence of cleft palate in their fetuses ( 4 . 5 % of fetuses at 0 . 25 mg / kg / day or greater , corresponding to approximately 2 times MRDI dose , 9 . 3 % of fetuses at 2 . 5 mg / kg / day , approximately 20 times MRDI dose of levalbuterol tartrate for adults on a mg / m2 basis ) .
The drug did not induce cleft palate formation when administered subcutaneously at a dose of 0 . 025 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 2 times MRDI dose of levalbuterol tartrate for adults on a mg / m2 basis ) .
In addition , oral administration of racemic albuterol sulfate to pregnant rabbits resulted in an increased incidence of cranioschisis in fetuses ( approximately 1500 times the MRDI dose of levalbuterol tartrate for adults on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Non - Teratogenic Effects : A study in which pregnant rats were dosed with radiolabeled racemic albuterol sulfate demonstrated that drug - related material is transferred from the maternal circulation to the fetus .
8 . 2 Labor and Delivery Because of the potential for beta - adrenergic agonists to interfere with uterine contractility , the use of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol for the treatment of bronchospasm during labor should be restricted to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risk .
Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol has not been approved for the management of preterm labor .
The benefit : risk ratio when levalbuterol tartrate is administered for tocolysis has not been established .
Serious adverse reactions , including maternal pulmonary edema , have been reported during or following treatment of premature labor with beta2 - agonists , including racemic albuterol .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Plasma concentrations of levalbuterol after inhalation of therapeutic doses are very low in humans .
It is not known whether levalbuterol is excreted in human milk .
Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for racemic albuterol in animal studies and the lack of experience with the use of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol by nursing mothers , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
Caution should be exercised when Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Pediatric Patients 4 Years of Age and Older The safety and efficacy of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol have been established in pediatric patients 4 years of age and older in an adequate and well - controlled clinical trial [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Pediatric Patients less than 4 Years of Age Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol is not indicated for pediatric patients less than 4 years of age .
A clinical trial in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years showed no statistical significant difference between treatment groups in the primary efficacy endpoint .
There was an increased incidence of asthma - related adverse reactions reported in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years treated with Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol compared to placebo .
Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol was evaluated in one 4 - week , multicenter , randomized , modified - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel group trial of 196 pediatric patients ages birth to < 4 years of age with asthma or reactive airway disease ( 68 patients birth to < 2 years of age and 128 patients 2 to < 4 years of age ) .
Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol 45 mcg ( N = 23 ) , Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol 90 mcg ( N = 42 ) , levalbuterol inhalation solution 0 . 31 mg ( N = 63 ) , and placebo HFA ( N = 68 ) were administered three times daily .
Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol or placebo HFA was delivered with the Monaghan AeroChamber MAX ™ Valved Holding Chamber with mask .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in Pediatric Asthma Caregiver Assessment ( PACA ) total score from baseline over the 4 week treatment period .
There was no statistical difference in the change in PACA total score between Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol and placebo .
Regarding safety , an increased number of treatment - emergent asthma - related adverse reactions were reported in Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol - treated patients .
Eight subjects reported asthma - related adverse reactions for Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol compared to 3 subjects for placebo .
There was one subject that discontinued treatment due to asthma in the Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol group compared to zero subjects in the placebo group ( Table 3 ) .
Other adverse reactions were consistent with those observed in the clinical trial population of patients 4 years of age and older [ seeAdverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Table 3 : Asthma - related Adverse Reactions in a 4 - Week Clinical Trial in Children Birth to < 4 Years of Age * Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol 45 - 90 mcg ( n = 65 ) Levalbuterol inhalation solution 0 . 31 mg ( n = 63 ) Placebo ( n = 68 ) Asthma - related adverse reactions * , n ( % ) 8 ( 12 % ) 6 ( 10 % ) 3 ( 4 % ) Treatment discontinuations due to asthma , n ( % ) 1 ( 2 % ) 2 ( 3 % ) 0 * This table includes the following Preferred Terms ( whether considered by the investigator to be related or unrelated to drug ) : asthma , cough , hypoxia , status asthmaticus , tachypnea 8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant diseases or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Albuterol is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
10 OVERDOSAGE The expected symptoms with overdosage are those of excessive beta - adrenergic receptor stimulation and / or occurrence or exaggeration of any of the symptoms listed under Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) , e . g . , seizures , angina , hypertension or hypotension , tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats / minute , arrhythmias , nervousness , headache , tremor , dry mouth , palpitation , nausea , dizziness , fatigue , malaise , and sleeplessness .
Hypokalemia also may occur .
As with all sympathomimetic medications , cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with the abuse of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol .
Treatment consists of discontinuation of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol together with appropriate symptomatic therapy .
The judicious use of a cardioselective beta - receptor blocker may be considered , bearing in mind that such medication can produce bronchospasm .
There is insufficient evidence to determine if dialysis is beneficial for overdosage of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol .
11 DESCRIPTION The active component of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol is levalbuterol tartrate , the ( R ) - enantiomer of albuterol .
Levalbuterol tartrate is a relatively selective beta2 - adrenergic receptor agonist [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) ] .
Levalbuterol tartrate has the chemical name ( R ) - α1 - [ [ ( 1 , 1 - dimethylethyl ) amino ] methyl ] - 4 - hydroxy - 1 , 3 - benzenedimethanol L - tartrate ( 2 : 1 salt ) , and it has the following chemical structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The molecular weight of levalbuterol tartrate is 628 . 71 , and its empirical formula is ( C13H21NO3 ) 2 · C4H6O6 .
It is a white to light - yellow solid , freely soluble in water and very slightly soluble in ethanol .
Levalbuterol tartrate is the generic name for ( R ) - albuterol tartrate in the United States .
Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol is a pressurized metered - dose aerosol inhaler ( MDI ) , which produces an aerosol for oral inhalation .
It contains a suspension of micronized levalbuterol tartrate , propellant HFA - 134 a ( 1 , 1 , 1 , 2 - tetrafluoroethane ) , Dehydrated Alcohol USP , and Oleic Acid NF .
After priming with 4 actuations , each actuation of the inhaler delivers 67 . 8 mcg of levalbuterol tartrate ( equivalent to 51 . 6 mcg of levalbuterol free base ) from the valve and 59 mcg of levalbuterol tartrate ( equivalent to 45 mcg of levalbuterol free base ) from the actuator mouthpiece .
Each 15 g canister provides 200 actuations ( or inhalations ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Activation of beta2 - adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic - 3 ' , 5 ' - adenosine monophosphate ( cyclic AMP ) .
The increase in cyclic AMP is associated with the activation of protein kinase A , which in turn , inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations , resulting in muscle relaxation .
Levalbuterol relaxes the smooth muscles of all airways , from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles .
Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of the release of mediators from mast cells in the airways .
Levalbuterol acts as a functional antagonist to relax the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved , thus protecting against all bronchoconstrictor challenges .
While it is recognized that beta2 - adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors on bronchial smooth muscle , data indicate that there are beta - receptors in the human heart , 10 % to 50 % of which are beta2 - adrenergic receptors .
The precise function of these receptors has not been established [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ] .
However , all beta - adrenergic agonist drugs can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients , as measured by pulse rate , blood pressure , symptoms , and / or electrocardiographic changes .
12 . 2 Pharmacokinetics A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using plasma concentrations of ( R ) - albuterol obtained from 632 asthmatic patients aged 4 to 81 years in three large trials .
For adolescent and adult patients 12 years and older , following 90 mcg dose of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol , yielded mean peak plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) and systemic exposure ( AUC0 - 6 ) of approximately 199 pg / mL and 695 pg • h / mL , respectively , compared to approximately 238 pg / mL and 798 pg • h / mL , respectively , following 180 mcg dose of Racemic Albuterol HFA metered - dose inhaler .
For pediatric patients from 4 to 11 years of age , following 90 mcg dose of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol , yielded Cmax and AUC0 - 6 of approximately 163 pg / mL and 579 pg • h / mL , respectively , compared to approximately 238 pg / mL and 828 pg • h / mL , respectively , following 180 mcg dose of Racemic Albuterol HFA metered - dose inhaler .
These pharmacokinetic data indicate that mean exposure to ( R ) - albuterol was 13 % to 16 % less in adult and 30 % to 32 % less in pediatric patients given Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol as compared to those given a comparable dose of racemic albuterol .
When compared to adult patients , pediatric patients given 90 mcg of levalbuterol have a 17 % lower mean exposure to ( R ) - albuterol .
Metabolism and Elimination Information available in the published literature suggests that the primary enzyme responsible for the metabolism of albuterol enantiomers in humans is SULT1A3 ( sulfotransferase ) .
When racemic albuterol was administered either intravenously or via inhalation after oral charcoal administration , there was a 3 - to 4 - fold difference in the area under the concentration - time curves between the ( R ) - and ( S ) - albuterol enantiomers , with ( S ) - albuterol concentrations being consistently higher .
However , without charcoal pretreatment , after either oral or inhalation administration the differences were 8 - to 24 - fold , suggesting that ( R ) - albuterol is preferentially metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract , presumably by SULT1A3 .
The primary route of elimination of albuterol enantiomers is through renal excretion ( 80 % to 100 % ) of either the parent compound or the primary metabolite .
Less than 20 % of the drug is detected in the feces .
Following intravenous administration of racemic albuterol , between 25 % and 46 % of the ( R ) - albuterol fraction of the dose was excreted as unchanged ( R ) - albuterol in the urine .
Special Populations Hepatic Impairment The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol has not been evaluated .
Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of racemic albuterol was evaluated in 5 subjects with creatinine clearance of 7 to 53 mL / min , and the results were compared with those from healthy volunteers .
Renal disease had no effect on the half - life , but there was a 67 % decline in racemic albuterol clearance .
Caution should be used when administering high doses of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol to patients with renal impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Although there have been no carcinogenesis studies with levalbuterol tartrate , racemic albuterol sulfate has been evaluated for its carcinogenic potential .
In a 2 - year study in Sprague - Dawley rats , dietary administration of racemic albuterol sulfate resulted in a significant dose - related increase in the incidence of benign leiomyomas of the mesovarium at doses of 2 mg / kg / day and greater ( approximately 30 times the MRDI ) dose of levalbuterol tartrate for adults and approximately 15 times the MRDI dose of levalbuterol tartrate for children on a mg / m2 basis ) .
In an 18 - month study in CD - 1 mice and a 22 - month study in the golden hamster , dietary administration of racemic albuterol sulfate showed no evidence of tumorigenicity .
Dietary doses in CD - 1 mice were up to 500 mg / kg / day ( approximately 3800 times the MRDI dose of levalbuterol tartrate for adults and approximately 1800 times the MRDI dose of levalbuterol tartrate for children on a mg / m2 basis ) and doses in the golden hamster study were up to 50 mg / kg / day ( approximately 500 times the MRDI dose of levalbuterol tartrate for adults on a mg / m2 basis and approximately 240 times the MRDI dose of levalbuterol tartrate for children on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Levalbuterol HCl was not mutagenic in the Ames test or the CHO / HPRT Mammalian Forward Gene Mutation Assay .
Levalbuterol HCl was not clastogenic in the in vivo micronucleus test in mouse bone marrow .
Racemic albuterol sulfate was not clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in CHO cell cultures .
No fertility studies have been conducted with levalbuterol tartrate .
Reproduction studies in rats using racemic albuterol sulfate demonstrated no evidence of impaired fertility at oral doses up to 50 mg / kg / day ( approximately 750 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose of levalbuterol tartrate for adults on a mg / m2 basis ) .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Propellant HFA - 134 a In animals and humans , propellant HFA - 134 a was found to be rapidly absorbed and rapidly eliminated , with an elimination half - life of 3 to 27 minutes in animals and 5 to 7 minutes in humans .
Time to maximum plasma concentration ( tmax ) and mean residence time are both extremely short , leading to a transient appearance of HFA - 134 a in the blood with no evidence of accumulation .
Based on studies in animals , the propellant HFA - 134 a had no detectable toxicological activity at amounts less than 380 times the maximum human exposure based on comparisons of AUC values .
The toxicological effects observed at these very high doses included ataxia , tremors , dyspnea , or salivation , similar to effects produced by the structurally - related chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) used in metered - dose inhalers , that were extensively used in the past .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Bronchospasm Associated with Asthma Adults and Adolescent Patients 12 Years of Age and Older The efficacy and safety of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol were established in two 8 - week , multicenter , randomized , double - blind , active - and placebo - controlled trials in 748 adults and adolescents with asthma between the ages of 12 and 81 years .
In these two trials , Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol ( 403 patients ) was compared to an HFA - 134 a placebo MDI ( 166 patients ) , and the trials included a marketed albuterol HFA - 134 a MDI ( 179 patients ) as an active control .
Serial forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV1 ) measurements demonstrated that 90 mcg ( 2 inhalations ) of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol produced significantly greater improvement in FEV1 over the pretreatment value than placebo .
The results from one of the trials are shown in Figure 1 as the mean percent change in FEV1 from test - day baseline at Day 1 ( n = 445 ) and Day 56 ( n = 387 ) .
The results from the second trial were similar .
Figure 1 : Percent Change in FEV1 from Test - Day Baseline in Adults and Adolescents Aged 12 to 81 Years at Day 1 and Day 56 [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] For Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol on Day 1 , the median time to onset of a 15 % increase in FEV1 ranged from 5 . 5 to 10 . 2 minutes and the median time to peak effect ranged from 76 to 78 minutes .
In the responder population , on Day 1 the median duration of effect as measured by a 15 % increase in FEV1 was 3 to 4 hours , with duration of effect in some patients of up to 6 hours .
Pediatric Patients 4 to 11 Years of Age The efficacy and safety of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol in children were established in a 4 - week , multicenter , randomized , double - blind , active - and placebo - controlled trial in 150 pediatric patients with asthma between the ages of 4 and 11 years .
In this trial , Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol ( 76 patients ) was compared to a placebo HFA - 134 a MDI ( 35 patients ) , and the trial included a marketed albuterol HFA - 134 a MDI ( 39 patients ) as an active control .
Serial FEV1 measurements demonstrated that 90 mcg ( 2 inhalations ) of Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol produced significantly greater improvement in FEV1 over the pretreatment value than placebo and were consistent with the efficacy findings in the adult studies .
For Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol , on Day 1 the median time to onset of a 15 % increase in FEV1 was 4 . 5 minutes and the median time to peak effect was 77 minutes .
In the responder population , the median duration of effect as measured by a 15 % increase in FEV1 was 3 hours , with a duration of effect in some pediatric patients of up to 6 hours .
