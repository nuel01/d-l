8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 . 2 % / 2 . 5 % use in pregnant women to evaluate a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
The limited published data on use of clindamycin in pregnant women with exposure during the first trimester are insufficient to inform a drug - associated risk of pregnancy - related adverse outcomes ( see Data ) .
In limited published clinical trials with pregnant women , the systemic administration of clindamycin during the second and third trimesters has not been associated with an increased frequency of major birth defects .
In animal reproduction studies , clindamycin did not cause malformations or embryo - fetal development toxicity in pregnant rats and mice when administered during the period of organogenesis at systemic doses up to 240 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 2 . 5 g Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 . 2 % / 2 . 5 % , based on body surface area ( BSA ) comparisons ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of major birth defects , loss , and other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data In limited published trials in pregnant women administered clindamycin during the first trimester of pregnancy , there was no difference in the rate of major birth defects reported among in utero exposed infants compared to unexposed infants .
These data cannot definitely establish or exclude any clindamycin - associated risk during pregnancy .
Animal Data Animal reproductive / developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 . 2 % / 2 . 5 % or benzoyl peroxide .
Developmental toxicity studies of clindamycin performed in pregnant rats and mice administered during the period of organogenesis at oral doses of up to 600 mg / kg / day ( 240 and 120 times the MRHD for clindamycin , respectively , based on BSA comparisons ) or subcutaneous doses of up to 200 mg / kg / day ( 80 and 40 times the MRHD for clindamycin , respectively , based on BSA comparisons ) revealed no malformations or embryo - fetal development toxicity .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of clindamycin or benzoyl peroxide in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production following topical administration .

11 DESCRIPTION Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 . 2 % / 2 . 5 % is a combination product with two active ingredients in a white to off - white , opaque , smooth , aqueous gel formulation intended for topical use .
Clindamycin phosphate is a water - soluble ester of the semisynthetic antibiotic produced by a 7 ( S ) - chloro - substitution of the 7 ( R ) - hydroxyl group of the parent antibiotic lincomycin .
The chemical name for clindamycin phosphate is Methyl 7 - chloro - 6 , 7 , 8 - trideoxy - 6 - ( 1 - methyl - trans - 4 - propyl - L - 2 - pyrrolidinecarboxamido ) - 1 - thio - L - threo - α - Dgalacto - octopyranoside 2 - ( dihydrogen phosphate ) .
The structural formula or clindamycin phosphate is represented below : Clindamycin phosphate : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Molecular Formula : C18H34ClN2O8PS Molecular Weight : 504 . 97 Benzoyl peroxide is an antibacterial and keratolytic agent .
The structural formula for benzoyl peroxide is represented below : Benzoyl peroxide : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Molecular Formula : C14H10O4 Molecular Weight : 242 . 23 Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 . 2 % / 2 . 5 % contains the following inactive ingredients : purified water , carbomer 980 , propylene glycol , and potassium hydroxide .
Each gram of Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 . 2 % / 2 . 5 % contains 1 . 2 % of clindamycin phosphate which is equivalent to 1 % clindamycin .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Clindamycin : Clindamycin is a lincosamide antibacterial [ See Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
Benzoyl Peroxide : Benzoyl peroxide is an oxidizing agent with bactericidal and keratolytic effects but the precise mechanism of action is unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The systemic absorption of clindamycin was investigated in an open - label , multiple - dose trial in 16 adult subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris treated with 1 gram of clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel , 1 . 2 % / 2 . 5 % applied to the face once daily for 30 days .
Twelve subjects ( 75 % ) had at least one quantifiable clindamycin plasma concentration above the lower limit of quantification ( LOQ = 0 . 5 ng / mL ) on Day 1 or Day 30 .
On Day 1 , the mean ( ± standard deviation ) peak plasma concentration ( Cmax ) was 0 . 78 ± 0 . 22 ng / mL ( n = 9 with measurable concentrations ) , and the mean AUC0 - t was 5 . 29 ± 0 . 81 h . ng / mL ( n = 4 ) .
On Day 30 , the mean Cmax was 1 . 22 ± 0 . 88 ng / mL ( n = 10 ) , and the mean AUC0 - t was 8 . 42 ± 6 . 01 h . ng / mL ( n = 6 ) .
Clindamycin plasma concentrations were below LOQ in all subjects at 24 hours post - dose on the three tested days ( Day 1 , 15 , and 30 ) .
Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be absorbed by the skin where it is converted to benzoic acid .
12 . 4 Microbiology Clindamycin binds to the 50 S ribosomal subunits of susceptible bacteria and prevents elongation of peptide chains by interfering with peptidyl transfer , thereby suppressing bacterial protein synthesis .
Clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide individually have been shown to have in vitro activity against Propionibacterium acnes , an organism which has been associated with acne vulgaris ; however , the clinical significance of this activity against P . acnes is not known .
P . acnes resistance to clindamycin has been documented .
Resistance to clindamycin is often associated with resistance to erythromycin .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity , mutagenicity , and impairment of fertility testing of Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 . 2 % / 2 . 5 % have not been performed .
Benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be a tumor promoter and progression agent in a number of animal studies .
Benzoyl peroxide in acetone at doses of 5 and 10 mg administered topically twice per week for 20 weeks induced skin tumors in transgenic Tg . AC mice .
The clinical significance of this is unknown .
Carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with a gel formulation containing 1 % clindamycin and 5 % benzoyl peroxide .
In a 2 - year dermal carcinogenicity study in mice , treatment with the gel formulation at doses of 900 , 2700 , and 15000 mg / kg / day ( 1 . 8 , 5 . 4 , and 30 times the MRHD for clindamycin and 3 . 6 , 10 . 8 , and 60 times the MRHD for benzoyl peroxide , respectively , based on BSA comparisons ) did not cause any increase in tumors .
However , topical treatment with a different gel formulation containing 1 % clindamycin and 5 % benzoyl peroxide at doses of 100 , 500 , and 2000 mg / kg / day caused a dose - dependent increase in the incidence of keratoacanthoma at the treated skin site of male rats in a 2 - year dermal carcinogenicity study in rats .
In an oral ( gavage ) carcinogenicity study in rats , treatment with the gel formulation at doses of 300 , 900 , and 3000 mg / kg / day ( 1 . 2 , 3 . 6 , and 12 times the MRHD for clindamycin and 2 . 4 , 7 . 2 , and 24 times the MRHD for benzoyl peroxide , respectively , based on BSA comparisons ) for up to 97 weeks did not cause any increase in tumors .
Clindamycin phosphate was not genotoxic in the human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay .
Benzoyl peroxide has been found to cause DNA strand breaks in a variety of mammalian cell types , to be mutagenic in S . typhimurium tests by some but not all investigators , and to cause sister chromatid exchanges in Chinese hamster ovary cells .
Fertility studies have not been performed with Clindamycin Phosphate and Benzoyl Peroxide Gel , 1 . 2 % / 2 . 5 % or benzoyl peroxide , but fertility and mating ability have been studied with clindamycin .
Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg / kg / day of clindamycin ( approximately 120 times the MRHD for clindamycin , based on BSA comparisons ) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of once daily use of clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel , 1 . 2 % / 2 . 5 % were assessed in two 12 - week multi - center , randomized , blinded trials in subjects 12 years and older with moderate to severe acne vulgaris .
