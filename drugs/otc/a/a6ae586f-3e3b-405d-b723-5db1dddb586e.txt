( 5 . 5 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Differentiation Syndrome Of 319 patients treated with XOSPATA in the clinical trials , 3 % experienced differentiation syndrome .
Differentiation syndrome is associated with rapid proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells and may be life - threatening or fatal if not treated .
Symptoms and other clinical findings of differentiation syndrome in patients treated with XOSPATA included fever , dyspnea , pleural effusion , pericardial effusion , pulmonary edema , hypotension , rapid weight gain , peripheral edema , rash , and renal dysfunction .
Some cases had concomitant acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis .
Differentiation syndrome occurred as early as 1 day and up to 82 days after XOSPATA initiation and has been observed with or without concomitant leukocytosis .
Of the 11 patients who experienced differentiation syndrome , 9 ( 82 % ) recovered after treatment or after dose interruption of XOSPATA .
If differentiation syndrome is suspected , initiate dexamethasone 10 mg IV every 12 hours ( or an equivalent dose of an alternative oral or IV corticosteroid ) and hemodynamic monitoring until improvement .
Taper corticosteroids after resolution of symptoms and administer corticosteroids for a minimum of 3 days .
Symptoms of differentiation syndrome may recur with premature discontinuation of corticosteroid treatment .
If severe signs and / or symptoms persist for more than 48 hours after initiation of corticosteroids , interrupt XOSPATA until signs and symptoms are no longer severe [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 2 Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome Of 319 patients treated with XOSPATA in the clinical trials , 1 % experienced posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome ( PRES ) with symptoms including seizure and altered mental status .
Symptoms have resolved after discontinuation of XOSPATA .
A diagnosis of PRES requires confirmation by brain imaging , preferably magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) .
Discontinue XOSPATA in patients who develop PRES [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 3 Prolonged QT Interval XOSPATA has been associated with prolonged cardiac ventricular repolarization ( QT interval ) .
Of the 317 patients with a post - baseline QTc measurement on treatment with XOSPATA in the clinical trial , 1 % were found to have a QTc interval greater than 500 msec and 7 % of patients had an increase from baseline QTc greater than 60 msec .
Perform electrocardiogram ( ECG ) prior to initiation of treatment with gilteritinib , on days 8 and 15 of cycle 1 , and prior to the start of the next two subsequent cycles .
Interrupt and reduce XOSPATA dosage in patients who have a QTcF > 500 msec [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may increase the QT prolongation risk .
Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to and during XOSPATA administration .
5 . 4 Pancreatitis Of 319 patients treated with XOSPATA in the clinical trials , 4 % experienced pancreatitis .
Evaluate patients who develop signs and symptoms of pancreatitis .
Interrupt and reduce the dose of XOSPATA in patients who develop pancreatitis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 5 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action , XOSPATA can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of gilteritinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused embryo - fetal lethality , suppressed fetal growth and teratogenicity at maternal exposures ( AUC24 ) approximately 0 . 4 times the AUC24 in patients receiving the recommended dose .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XOSPATA and for 6 months after the last dose of XOSPATA .
Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with XOSPATA and for 4 months after the last dose of XOSPATA .
Pregnant women , patients becoming pregnant while receiving XOSPATA or male patients with pregnant female partners should be apprised of the potential risk to the fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .

( 7 . 1 ) • • Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Consider alternative therapies .
If the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided , monitor patients more frequently for XOSPATA adverse reactions .
( 2 . 3 , 7 . 1 ) • • P - gp , BCRP , OCT1 Substrates : Decrease the dose of the substrates when coadministered with gilteritinib and as clinically indicated .
( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Effect of Other Drugs on XOSPATA Combined P - gp and Strong CYP3A Inducers Concomitant use of XOSPATA with a combined P - gp and strong CYP3A inducer decreases gilteritinib exposure which may decrease XOSPATA efficacy [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Avoid concomitant use of XOSPATA with combined P - gp and strong CYP3A inducers .
Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Concomitant use of XOSPATA with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increases gilteritinib exposure [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Consider alternative therapies that are not strong CYP3A inhibitors .
If the concomitant use of these inhibitors is considered essential for the care of the patient , monitor patient more frequently for XOSPATA adverse reactions .
Interrupt and reduce XOSPATA dosage in patients with serious or life - threatening toxicity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Effect of XOSPATA on Other Drugs Drugs that Target 5HT2B Receptor or Sigma Nonspecific Receptor Concomitant use of gilteritinib may reduce the effects of drugs that target the 5HT2B receptor or the sigma nonspecific receptor ( e . g . , escitalopram , fluoxetine , sertraline ) .
Avoid concomitant use of these drugs with XOSPATA unless their use is considered essential for the care of the patient [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
P - gp , BCRP , and OCT1 Substrates Based on in vitro data , gilteritinib is a P - gp , breast cancer resistant protein ( BCRP ) , and organic cation transporter 1 ( OCT1 ) inhibitor .
Coadministration of gilteritinib may increase the exposure of P - gp , BCRP , and OCT1 substrates , which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of these substrates [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
For P - gp , BCRP , or OCT1 substrates where small concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions , decrease the dose or modify the dosing frequency of such substrate and monitor for adverse reactions as recommended in the respective prescribing information .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise women not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies ( see Data ) and its mechanism of action , XOSPATA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data on XOSPATA use in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of gilteritinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including embryo - fetal lethality , suppressed fetal growth , and teratogenicity at maternal exposures ( AUC24 ) approximately 0 . 4 times the AUC24 in patients receiving the recommended dose ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % - 4 % and 15 % - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In an embryo - fetal development study in rats , pregnant animals received oral doses of gilteritinib of 0 , 0 . 3 , 3 , 10 , and 30 mg / kg / day during the period of organogenesis .
Maternal findings at 30 mg / kg / day ( resulting in exposures approximately 0 . 4 times the AUC24 in patients receiving the recommended dose ) included decreased body weight and food consumption .
Administration of gilteritinib at the dose of 30 mg / kg / day also resulted in embryo - fetal death ( postimplantation loss ) , decreased fetal body and placental weight , and decreased numbers of ossified sternebrae and sacral and caudal vertebrae , and increased incidence of fetal gross external ( anasarca , local edema , exencephaly , cleft lip , cleft palate , short tail , and umbilical hernia ) , visceral ( microphthalmia ; atrial and / or ventricular defects ; and malformed / absent kidney , and malpositioned adrenal , and ovary ) , and skeletal ( sternoschisis , absent rib , fused rib , fused cervical arch , misaligned cervical vertebra , and absent thoracic vertebra ) abnormalities .
Single oral administration of [ 14 C ] gilteritinib to pregnant rats resulted in transfer of radioactivity to the fetus similar to that observed in maternal plasma on day 14 of gestation .
In addition , distribution profiles of radioactivity in most maternal tissues and the fetus on day 18 of gestation were similar to that on day 14 of gestation .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of gilteritinib and / or its metabolites in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Following administration of radiolabeled gilteritinib to lactating rats , milk concentrations of radioactivity were higher than radioactivity in maternal plasma at 4 and 24 hours post - dose .
In animal studies , gilteritinib and / or its metabolite ( s ) were distributed to the tissues in infant rats via the milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child , advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with XOSPATA and for 2 months after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential XOSPATA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential within seven days prior to initiating XOSPATA treatment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after the last dose of XOSPATA .
Males Advise males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of XOSPATA .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 319 patients in clinical studies of XOSPATA , 43 % were age 65 years or older , and 13 % were 75 years or older .
No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between patients age 65 years or older and younger patients .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Gilteritinib is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases , including FMS - like tyrosine kinase 3 ( FLT3 ) .
Gilteritinib demonstrated the ability to inhibit FLT3 receptor signaling and proliferation in cells exogenously expressing FLT3 including FLT3 - ITD , tyrosine kinase domain mutations ( TKD ) FLT3 - D835Y and FLT3 - ITD - D835Y , and it induced apoptosis in leukemic cells expressing FLT3 - ITD .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with relapsed or refractory AML administered gilteritinib 120 mg , substantial ( > 90 % ) inhibition of FLT3 phosphorylation was rapid ( within 24 hours after first dose ) and sustained , as characterized by an ex vivo plasma inhibitory activity ( PIA ) assay .
Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of XOSPATA 120 mg once a day on the QTc interval has been evaluated in patients , which showed an absence of large mean increases ( i . e . , 20 msec ) in the QTc interval .
Of 317 patients with a post - baseline QTc measurement on treatment with gilteritinib at 120 mg in clinical trials , 4 patients ( 1 . 3 % ) experienced a QTcF > 500 msec .
Additionally , across all doses 2 . 3 % of patients with relapse / refractory AML had a maximum post - baseline QTcF interval > 500 msec [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The following pharmacokinetic parameters were observed following administration of gilteritinib 120 mg once daily , unless otherwise specified .
Gilteritinib exposure ( Cmax and AUC24 ) increases proportionally with once daily doses ranging from 20 mg to 450 mg ( 0 . 17 to 3 . 75 times the recommended dosage ) in patients with relapsed or refractory AML .
Gilteritinib mean ( ± SD ) steady - state Cmax is 374 ng / mL ( ± 190 ) and AUC24 is 6943 ng • hr / mL ( ± 3221 ) .
Steady - state plasma levels are reached within 15 days of dosing with an approximate 10 - fold accumulation .
Absorption The time to maximum gilteritinib concentration ( tmax ) observed is approximately between 4 and 6 hours post dose in the fasted state .
Effect of Food In healthy adults administered a single gilteritinib 40 mg dose ( 0 . 3 times the recommended dosage ) , gilteritinib Cmax decreased by 26 % and AUC decreased by less than 10 % when co - administered with a high - fat meal ( approximately 800 to 1 , 000 total calories with 500 to 600 fat calories , 250 carbohydrate calories , 150 protein calories ) compared to a fasted state .
Median tmax was delayed 2 hours when gilteritinib was administered with a high - fat meal .
Distribution The population mean ( % CV ) estimates of apparent central and peripheral volume of distribution were 1092 L ( 9 . 22 % ) and 1100 L ( 4 . 99 % ) , respectively , which may indicate extensive tissue distribution .
In vivo , gilteritinib is approximately 94 % bound to human plasma proteins .
In vitro , gilteritinib is primarily bound to human serum albumin .
Elimination The estimated half - life of gilteritinib is 113 hours , and the estimated apparent clearance is 14 . 85 L / h .
Metabolism Gilteritinib is primarily metabolized via CYP3A4 in vitro .
At steady state , the primary metabolites in humans include M17 ( formed via N - dealkylation and oxidation ) , M16 and M10 ( both formed via N ‑ dealkylation ) .
None of these 3 metabolites exceeded 10 % of overall parent exposure .
Excretion After a single radiolabeled dose , gilteritinib is excreted in feces with 64 . 5 % of the total administered dose recovered in feces .
Of the total radiolabeled dose of gilteritinib , 16 . 4 % was recovered in urine as unchanged drug and metabolites .
Specific Populations Age ( 20 - 87 years ) , sex , race , mild ( Child - Pugh Class A ) or moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B ) hepatic impairment and mild ( creatinine clearance ( CLCr ) 50 - 80 mL / min ) or moderate ( CLCr 30 - 50 mL / min ) renal impairment do not have clinically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of gilteritinib .
The effect of severe hepatic ( Child - Pugh Class C ) or severe renal impairment ( CLCr ≤ 29 mL / min ) on gilteritinib pharmacokinetics is unknown .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Combined P - gp and Strong CYP3A Inducers : Gilteritinib Cmax decreased approximately 30 % and AUC decreased approximately 70 % when co - administered with rifampin ( a combined P - gp and strong CYP3A inducer ) .
Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Gilteritinib Cmax increased approximately 20 % and AUC increased approximately 120 % when co - administered with itraconazole ( a strong CYP3A inhibitor ) .
Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors : Gilteritinib Cmax increased approximately 16 % and AUC increased approximately 40 % when co - administered with fluconazole ( a moderate CYP3A inhibitor ) .
CYP3A Substrates : Midazolam ( a CYP3A substrate ) Cmax and AUC increased approximately 10 % when co - administered with gilteritinib .
MATE1 Substrates : Cephalexin ( a MATE1 substrate ) Cmax and AUC decreased by less than 10 % when co - administered with gilteritinib .
In Vitro Studies Gilteritinib inhibits human 5HT2B receptor or sigma nonspecific receptors , which may reduce the effects of drugs that target these receptors such as escitalopram , fluoxetine and sertraline .
Gilteritinib is a substrate of P - gp and BCRP .
Gilteritinib inhibits BCRP , P - gp and OCT1 at clinically relevant concentrations .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with gilteritinib .
Gilteritinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenesis ( Ames ) assay and was not clastogenic in a chromosome aberration test assay in Chinese hamster lung cells .
Gilteritinib was positive for the induction of micronuclei in mouse bone marrow cells from 65 mg / kg ( 195 mg / m2 ) the mid dose tested ( approximately 2 . 6 times the recommended human dose of 120 mg ) .
The effect of XOSPATA on human fertility is unknown .
Administration of 10 mg / kg / day gilteritinib in the 4 - week study in dogs ( 12 days of dosing ) resulted in degeneration and necrosis of germ cells and spermatid giant cell formation in the testis as well as single cell necrosis of the epididymal duct epithelia of the epididymal head .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology In the 13 - week oral repeated dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs , target organs of toxicity included the eye and kidney .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia The efficacy of XOSPATA was assessed in the ADMIRAL Trial ( NCT02421939 ) , which included adult patients with relapsed or refractory AML having a FLT3 ITD , D835 , or I836 mutation by the LeukoStrat ® CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay .
XOSPATA was given orally at a starting dose of 120 mg daily until unacceptable toxicity or lack of clinical benefit .
First Interim Analysis The efficacy of XOSPATA was established on the basis of the rate of complete remission ( CR ) / CR with partial hematological recovery ( CRh ) , the duration of CR / CRh ( DOR ) , and the rate of conversion from transfusion dependence to transfusion independence at the first interim analysis in the ADMIRAL trial ( n = 138 ) .
The median follow - up was 4 . 6 months ( 95 % CI : 2 . 8 , 15 . 8 ) .
Fourteen patients were still in remission at the time of the first interim DOR analysis .
The efficacy results are shown in Table 5 .
For patients who achieved a CR / CRh , the median time to first response was 3 . 6 months ( range , 0 . 9 to 9 . 6 months ) .
The CR / CRh rate was 29 of 126 in patients with FLT3 - ITD or FLT3 - ITD / TKD and 0 of 12 in patients with FLT3 - TKD only .
Among the 106 patients who were dependent on red blood cell ( RBC ) and / or platelet transfusions at baseline , 33 ( 31 . 1 % ) became independent of RBC and platelet transfusions during any 56 - day post - baseline period .
For the 32 patients who were independent of both RBC and platelet transfusions at baseline , 17 ( 53 . 1 % ) remained transfusion - independent during any 56 - day post - baseline period .
