Dipyridamole is a coronary vasodilator described as 2 , 6 bis - ( diethanolamino ) - 4 , 8 dipiperidino - pyrimido - ( 5 , 4 - d ) pyrimidine .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] C24H40N8O4 MW 504 . 63 Dipyridamole Injection , USP is a sterile , odorless , pale yellow liquid which can be diluted in sodium chloride injection or dextrose injection for intravenous administration .
Each mL contains 5 mg dipyridamole , USP , 50 mg polyethylene glycol 600 and 2 mg tartaric acid in Water for Injection , USP .
pH 2 . 2 - 3 . 2 ; hydrochloric acid added for pH adjustment .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Clinical Pharmacology In a study of 10 patients with angiographically normal or minimally stenosed ( less than 25 % luminal diameter narrowing ) coronary vessels , Dipyridamole Injection in a dose of 0 . 56 mg / kg infused over 4 minutes resulted in an average fivefold increase in coronary blood flow velocity compared to resting coronary flow velocity ( range 3 . 8 to 7 times resting velocity ) .
The mean time to peak flow velocity was 6 . 5 minutes from the start of the 4 - minute infusion ( range 2 . 5 to 8 . 7 minutes ) .
Cardiovascular responses to the intravenous administration of Dipyridamole Injection when given to patients in the supine position include a mild but significant increase in heart rate of approximately 20 % and mild but significant decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure of approximately 2 - 8 % , with vital signs returning to baseline values in approximately 30 minutes .
Mechanism of Action Dipyridamole is a coronary vasodilator in man .
The mechanism of vasodilation has not been fully elucidated , but may result from inhibition of uptake of adenosine , an important mediator of coronary vasodilation .
The vasodilatory effects of dipyridamole are abolished by administration of the adenosine receptor antagonist theophylline .
How dipyridamole - induced vasodilation leads to abnormalities in thallium distribution and ventricular function is also uncertain but presumably represents a “ steal ” phenomenon in which relatively intact vessels dilate and sustain enhanced flow , leaving reduced pressure and flow across areas of hemodynamically important coronary vascular constriction .
Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Plasma dipyridamole concentrations decline in a triexponential fashion following intravenous infusion of dipyridamole , with halflives averaging 3 - 12 minutes , 33 - 62 minutes and 11 . 6 - 15 hours .
Two minutes following a 0 . 568 mg / kg dose of Dipyridamole Injection administered as a 4 - minute infusion , the mean dipyridamole serum concentration is 4 . 6 ± 1 . 3 mcg / mL .
The average plasma protein binding of dipyridamole is approximately 99 % , primarily toa1 - glycoprotein .
Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver to the glucuronic acid conjugate and excreted with the bile .
The average total body clearance is 2 . 3 - 3 . 5 mL / min / kg , with an apparent volume of distribution at steady state of 1 - 2 . 5 L / kg and a central apparent volume of 3 - 5 liters .
Indications and Usage Dipyridamole Injection is indicated as an alternative to exercise in thallium myocardial perfusion imaging for the evaluation of coronary artery disease in patients who cannot exercise adequately .
In a study of about 1100 patients who underwent coronary arteriography and Dipyridamole Injection assisted thallium imaging , the results of both tests were interpreted blindly and the sensitivity and specificity of the dipyridamole thallium study in predicting the angiographic outcome were calculated .
The sensitivity of the dipyridamole test ( true positive dipyridamole divided by the total number of patients with positive angiography ) was about 85 % .
The specificity ( true negative divided by the number of patients with negative angiograms ) was about 50 % .
In a subset of patients who had exercise thallium imaging as well as dipyridamole thallium imaging , sensitivity and specificity of the two tests were almost identical .
Contraindications Hypersensitivity to dipyridamole .
Warnings Serious adverse reactions associated with the administration of intravenous Dipyridamole Injection have included cardiac death , fatal and non - fatal myocardial infarction , ventricular fibrillation , symptomatic ventricular tachycardia , stroke , transient cerebral ischemia , seizures , anaphylactoid reaction and bronchospasm .
There have been reported cases of asystole , sinus node arrest , sinus node depression and conduction block .
Patients with abnormalities of cardiac impulse formation / conduction or severe coronary artery disease may be at increased risk for these events .
In a study of 3911 patients given intravenous dipyridamole as an adjunct to thallium myocardial perfusion imaging , two types of serious adverse events were reported : 1 .
four cases of myocardial infarction ( 0 . 1 % ) , two fatal ( 0 . 05 % ) and two non - fatal ( 0 . 05 % ) and 2 .
six cases of severe bronchospasm ( 0 . 2 % ) .
Although the incidence of these serious adverse events was small ( 0 . 3 % , 10 of 3911 ) , the potential clinical information to be gained through use of intravenous dipyridamole thallium imaging ( see INDICATIONS AND USAGE noting the rate of false positive and false negative results ) must be weighed against the risk to the patient .
Patients with a history of unstable angina may be at a greater risk for severe myocardial ischemia .
Patients with a history of asthma may be at a greater risk for bronchospasm during Dipyridamole Injection use .
When thallium myocardial perfusion imaging is performed with intravenous dipyridamole , parenteral aminophylline should be readily available for relieving adverse events such as bronchospasm or chest pain .
Vital signs should be monitored during , and for 10 - 15 minutes following , the intravenous infusion of dipyridamole and an electrocardiographic tracing should be obtained using at least one chest lead .
Should severe chest pain or bronchospasm occur , parenteral aminophylline may be administered by slow intravenous injection ( 50 - 100 mg over 30 - 60 seconds ) in doses ranging from 50 to 250 mg .
In the case of severe hypotension , the patient should be placed in a supine position with the head tilted down if necessary , before administration of parenteral aminophylline .
If 250 mg of aminophylline does not relieve chest pain symptoms within a few minutes , sublingual nitroglycerin may be administered .
If chest pain continues despite use of aminophylline and nitroglycerin , the possibility of myocardial infarction should be considered .
If the clinical condition of a patient with an adverse event permits a one - minute delay in the administration of parenteral aminophylline , thallium - 201 may be injected and allowed to circulate for one minute before the injection of aminophylline .
This will allow initial thallium perfusion imaging to be performed before reversal of the pharmacologic effects of dipyridamole on the coronary circulation .
Precautions See WARNINGS .
Drug Interactions Oral maintenance theophylline and other xanthine derivatives such as caffeine may abolish the coronary vasodilatation induced by intravenous Dipyridamole Injection administration .
This could lead to a false negative thallium imaging result ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Mechanism of Action ) .
Myasthenia gravis patients receiving therapy with cholinesterase inhibitors may experience worsening of their disease in the presence of dipyridamole .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In studies in which dipyridamole was administered in the feed at doses of up to 75 mg / kg / day ( 9 . 4 times1 the maximum recommended daily human oral dose ) in mice ( up to 128 weeks in males and up to 142 weeks in females ) and rats ( up to 111 weeks in males and females ) , there was no evidence of drug - related carcinogenesis .
Mutagenicity tests of dipyridamole with bacterial and mammalian cell systems were negative .
There was no evidence of impaired fertility when dipyridamole was administered to male and female rats at oral doses up to 500 mg / kg / day ( 63 times 1 .
the maximum recommended daily human oral dose ) .
A significant reduction in number of corpora lutea with consequent reduction in implantations and live fetuses was , however , observed at 1250 mg / kg / day .
1 Calculation based on assumed body weight of 50 kg Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects – Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies performed in mice and rats at daily oral doses of up to 125 mg / kg ( 15 . 6 times1 the maximum recommended daily human oral dose ) and in rabbits at daily oral doses of up to 20 mg / kg ( 2 . 5 times1 the maximum recommended daily human oral dose ) have revealed no evidence of impaired embryonic development due to dipyridamole .
There are , however , no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human responses , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
