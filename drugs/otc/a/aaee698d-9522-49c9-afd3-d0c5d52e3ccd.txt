5 mg 10 mg 200 mg156 mg 39 mg Clinical Studies : Because Ferrous Fumarate is an organic complex , it contains no free ions , either ferric or ferrous .
Polysaccharide Iron Complex is clinically non - toxic .
Prior studies in rats demonstrated that Polysaccharide Iron Complex ( PIC ) , administered as a single oral dose to Sprague Dawley rats did not produce evidence of toxicity at a dosage level of 5000 mg Iron / kg : ( An Acute Oral Toxicity Study in Rats with Polysaccharide - Iron Complex .
T . N . Merriman , M . Aikman and R . E . Rush , Springborn Laboratories , Inc .
Spencerville , Ohio Study No . 3340 . 1 March - April 1994 ) .
Other clinical studies had demonstrated that Polysaccharide Iron gives a good hematopoietic response with an almost complete absence of the side effects usually associated with oral iron therapy .
Picinni and Ricciotti suggested in 1982 , that " the therapeutic effectiveness of Polysaccharide Iron Complex when compared with iron fumarate in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia , appears to be as active as the iron fumarate and as well tolerated , however , it exerted a greater influence on the level of hemoglobin and on the number of red cells ... " and that , " it has been exceptionally well tolerated by all patients " ( Picinni , L . - Ricciotti , M . 1982 .

As mentioned above , the patented source of iron used in Concept DHATM ( Ferrous Fumarate and Polysaccharide Iron Complex ) provides a high level of elemental iron with a low incidence of gastric distress .
CONCLUSION : Based on the results of this study , the oral combination of Ferrous Fumarate and Polysaccharide Iron Complex was better tolerated and safer than the oral administration of Ferrous Fumarate alone .
The conclusion of this research stated , that the addition of PIC to Ferrous Fumarate surprisingly allows the same concentration of Ferrous Fumarate to be better tolerated than the Ferrous Fumarate alone .
INDICATIONS : Concept DHATM is a prescription prenatal vitamin - mineral preparation containing omega - 3 fatty acid supplements designed to supply nutritional supplementation for women throughout pregnancy and during the postnatal period to lactating and non - lactating mothers .
Concept DHATM may also be used to improve the nutritional status of women before conception .

Keep this product out of reach of children .
In case of accidental overdose , call a doctor or poison control center immediately .
WARNING : Ingestion of more than 3 grams of omega - 3 fatty acids from fish oils per day may have potential antithrombotic effects , including an increased bleeding time and INR ( international normalized ratio ) .
DHA should be avoided in patients with inherited or acquired bleeding diatheses , including those taking anticoagulants .
WARNING : Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment for pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where Vitamin B12 is deficient .
PRECAUTIONS : General : Folic acid in doses above 0 . 1 mg - 0 . 4 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia , in that hematological remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : Adults ( persons over 12 years of age ) , one ( 1 ) capsule daily , between meals , or as prescribed by a physician .
