( 5 . 2 ) • • Should not be used in patients with Netherton ’ s Syndrome or skin diseases with a potential for increased systemic absorption .
( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Risk of Immunosuppression Prolonged systemic use of calcineurin inhibitors for sustained immunosuppression in animal studies and transplant patients following systemic administration has been associated with an increased risk of infections , lymphomas , and skin malignancies .
These risks are associated with the intensity and duration of immunosuppression .
Based on this information and the mechanism of action , there is a concern about a potential risk with the use of topical calcineurin inhibitors , including pimecrolimus cream , 1 % .
While a causal relationship has not been established , rare cases of skin malignancy and lymphoma have been reported in patients treated with topical calcineurin inhibitors , including pimecrolimus cream , 1 % .
Therefore : • • Continuous long - term use of topical calcineurin inhibitors , including pimecrolimus cream , 1 % in any age group should be avoided , and application limited to areas of involvement with atopic dermatitis • • Pimecrolimus cream , 1 % is not indicated for use in children less than 2 years of age • • Pimecrolimus cream , 1 % should not be used in immunocompromised adults and children , including patients on systemic immunosuppressive medications .
• • If signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis do not improve within 6 weeks , patients should be re - examined by their healthcare provider and their diagnosis be confirmed .
• • The safety of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % has not been established beyond one year of non - continuous use .
5 . 2 Application to Malignant or Pre - malignant Skin Conditions The use of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % should be avoided on malignant or pre - malignant skin conditions .
Malignant or premalignant skin conditions , such as cutaneous T - cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) , can present as dermatitis .
Pimecrolimus cream , 1 % should not be used in patients with Netherton ’ s Syndrome or other skin diseases where there is the potential for increased systemic absorption of pimecrolimus .
The safety of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % has not been established in patients with generalized erythroderma .
The use of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % may cause local symptoms such as skin burning ( burning sensation , stinging , soreness ) or pruritus .
Localized symptoms are most common during the first few days of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % application and typically improve as the lesions of atopic dermatitis resolve [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 3 Bacterial and Viral Skin Infections Before commencing treatment with pimecrolimus cream , 1 % bacterial or viral infections at treatment sites should be resolved .
Trials have not evaluated the safety and efficacy of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % in the treatment of clinically infected atopic dermatitis .
While patients with atopic dermatitis are predisposed to superficial skin infections including eczema herpeticum ( Kaposi ’ s varicelliform eruption ) , treatment with pimecrolimus cream , 1 % may be independently associated with an increased risk of varicella zoster virus infection ( chicken pox or shingles ) , herpes simplex virus infection , or eczema herpeticum .
In clinical trials , 15 / 1 , 544 ( 1 % ) cases of skin papilloma ( warts ) were observed in subjects using pimecrolimus cream , 1 % .
The youngest subject was age 2 and the oldest was age 12 .
In cases where there is worsening of skin papillomas or they do not respond to conventional therapy , discontinuation of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % should be considered until complete resolution of the warts is achieved .
5 . 4 Patients with Lymphadenopathy In clinical trials , 14 / 1 , 544 ( 0 . 9 % ) cases of lymphadenopathy were reported while using pimecrolimus cream , 1 % .
These cases of lymphadenopathy were usually related to infections and noted to resolve upon appropriate antibiotic therapy .
Of these 14 cases , the majority had either a clear etiology or were known to resolve .
Patients who receive pimecrolimus cream , 1 % and who develop lymphadenopathy should have the etiology of their lymphadenopathy investigated .
In the absence of a clear etiology for the lymphadenopathy , or in the presence of acute infectious mononucleosis , pimecrolimus cream , 1 % should be discontinued .
Patients who develop lymphadenopathy should be monitored to ensure that the lymphadenopathy resolves .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
No phototoxicity and no photoallergenicity were detected in clinical trials with 24 and 33 normal volunteers , respectively .
In human dermal safety trials , pimecrolimus cream , 1 % did not induce contact sensitization or cumulative irritation .
In a one - year safety trial in pediatric subjects age 2 to 17 years old involving sequential use of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % and a topical corticosteroid , 43 % of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % treated subjects and 68 % of vehicle - treated subjects used corticosteroids during the trial .
Corticosteroids were used for more than 7 days by 34 % of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % treated subjects and 54 % of vehicle - treated subjects .
An increased incidence of impetigo , skin infection , superinfection ( infected atopic dermatitis ) , rhinitis , and urticaria were found in the subjects that had used pimecrolimus cream , 1 % and topical corticosteroid sequentially as compared to pimecrolimus cream , 1 % alone .
In 3 randomized , double - blind vehicle - controlled pediatric trials and one active - controlled adult trial , 843 and 328 subjects respectively , were treated with pimecrolimus cream , 1 % .
In these clinical trials , 48 ( 4 % ) of the 1 , 171 pimecrolimus cream , 1 % treated subjects and 13 ( 3 % ) of 408 vehicle - treated subjects discontinued therapy due to adverse events .
Discontinuations for AEs were primarily due to application site reactions , and cutaneous infections .
The most common application site reaction was application site burning , which occurred in 8 % to 26 % of subjects treated with pimecrolimus cream , 1 % .

Causality has not been established .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
General : Anaphylactic reactions , ocular irritation after application of the cream to the eye lids or near the eyes , angioneurotic edema , facial edema , skin flushing associated with alcohol use , skin discoloration .
Hematology / Oncology : Lymphomas , basal cell carcinoma , malignant melanoma , squamous cell carcinoma .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Potential interactions between pimecrolimus cream , 1 % and other drugs , including immunizations , have not been systematically evaluated .
Due to low blood levels of pimecrolimus detected in some patients after topical application , systemic drug interactions are not expected , but cannot be ruled out .
The concomitant administration of known CYP3A family of inhibitors in patients with widespread and / or erythrodermic disease should be done with caution .
Some examples of such drugs are erythromycin , itraconazole , ketoconazole , fluconazole , calcium channel blockers and cimetidine .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well - controlled studies with pimecrolimus cream , 1 % in pregnant women .
Therefore , pimecrolimus cream , 1 % should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
In dermal embryofetal developmental studies , no maternal or fetal toxicity was observed up to the highest practicable doses tested , 10 mg / kg / day ( 1 % pimecrolimus cream ) in rats ( 0 . 14 X MRHD based on body surface area ) and 10 mg / kg / day ( 1 % pimecrolimus cream ) in rabbits ( 0 . 65 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
The 1 % pimecrolimus cream was administered topically for 6 hours / day during the period of organogenesis in rats and rabbits ( gestational days 6 to 21 in rats and gestational days 6 to 20 in rabbits ) .
A second dermal embryofetal development study was conducted in rats using pimecrolimus cream applied dermally to pregnant rats ( 1 g cream / kg body weight of 0 . 2 % , 0 . 6 % and 1 % pimecrolimus cream ) from gestation day 6 to 17 at doses of 2 , 6 , and 10 mg / kg / day with daily exposure of approximately 22 hours .
No maternal , reproductive , or embryo - fetal toxicity attributable to pimecrolimus was noted at 10 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 66 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) , the highest dose evaluated in this study .
No teratogenicity was noted in this study at any dose .
A combined oral fertility and embryofetal developmental study was conducted in rats and an oral embryofetal developmental study was conducted in rabbits .
Pimecrolimus was administered during the period of organogenesis ( 2 weeks prior to mating until gestational day 16 in rats , gestational days 6 to 18 in rabbits ) up to dose levels of 45 mg / kg / day in rats and 20 mg / kg / day in rabbits .
In the absence of maternal toxicity , indicators of embryofetal toxicity ( post - implantation loss and reduction in litter size ) were noted at 45 mg / kg / day ( 38 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) in the oral fertility and embryofetal developmental study conducted in rats .
No malformations in the fetuses were noted at 45 mg / kg / day ( 38 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) in this study .
No maternal toxicity , embryotoxicity or teratogenicity were noted in the oral rabbit embryofetal developmental toxicity study at 20 mg / kg / day ( 3 . 9 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) , which was the highest dose tested in this study .
A second oral embryofetal development study was conducted in rats .
Pimecrolimus was administered during the period of organogenesis ( gestational days 6 to 17 ) at doses of 2 , 10 and 45 mg / kg / day .
Maternal toxicity , embryolethality and fetotoxicity were noted at 45 mg / kg / day ( 271 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
A slight increase in skeletal variations that were indicative of delayed skeletal ossification was also noted at this dose .
No maternal toxicity , embryolethality or fetotoxicity were noted at 10 mg / kg / day ( 16 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
No teratogenicity was noted in this study at any dose .
A second oral embryofetal development study was conducted in rabbits .
Pimecrolimus was administered during the period of organogenesis ( gestational days 7 to 20 ) at doses of 2 , 6 and 20 mg / kg / day .
Maternal toxicity , embryotoxicity and fetotoxicity were noted at 20 mg / kg / day ( 12 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
A slight increase in skeletal variations that were indicative of delayed skeletal ossification was also noted at this dose .
No maternal toxicity , embryotoxicity or fetotoxicity were noted at 6 mg / kg / day ( 5 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
No teratogenicity was noted in this study at any dose .
An oral peri - and post - natal developmental study was conducted in rats .
Pimecrolimus was administered from gestational day 6 through lactational day 21 up to a dose level of 40 mg / kg / day .
Only 2 of 22 females delivered live pups at the highest dose of 40 mg / kg / day .
Postnatal survival , development of the F1 generation , their subsequent maturation and fertility were not affected at 10 mg / kg / day ( 12 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) , the highest dose evaluated in this study .
Pimecrolimus was transferred across the placenta in oral rat and rabbit embryofetal developmental studies .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from pimecrolimus , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Pimecrolimus cream , 1 % is not indicated for use in children less than 2 years of age .
The long - term safety and effects of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % on the developing immune system are unknown Three Phase 3 pediatric trials were conducted involving 1 , 114 subjects 2 to 17 years of age .
Two trials were 6 - week randomized vehicle - controlled trials with a 20 - week open - label phase and one was a vehicle - controlled ( up to 1 year ) safety trial with the option for sequential topical corticosteroid use .
Of these subjects 542 ( 49 % ) were 2 to 6 years of age .
In the short - term trials , 11 % of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % subjects did not complete these trials and 1 . 5 % of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % , subjects discontinued due to adverse events .
In the one - year trial , 32 % of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % , subjects did not complete this trial and 3 % of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % , subjects discontinued due to adverse events .
Most discontinuations were due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect .
The most common local adverse event in the short - term trials of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % in pediatric subjects ages 2 to 17 was application site burning ( 10 % vs . 13 % vehicle ) ; the incidence in the long - term trial was 9 % pimecrolimus cream , 1 % vs . 7 % vehicle [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Adverse events that were more frequent ( > 5 % ) in subjects treated with pimecrolimus cream , 1 % compared to vehicle were headache ( 14 % vs . 9 % ) in the short - term trial .
Nasopharyngitis ( 26 % vs . 21 % ) , influenza ( 13 % vs . 4 % ) , pharyngitis ( 8 % vs . 3 % ) , viral infection ( 7 % vs . 1 % ) , pyrexia ( 13 % vs . 5 % ) , cough ( 16 % vs . 11 % ) , and headache ( 25 % vs . 16 % ) were increased over vehicle in the 1 - year safety trial [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In 843 subjects ages 2 to 17 years treated with pimecrolimus cream , 1 % 9 ( 0 . 8 % ) developed eczema herpeticum ( 5 on pimecrolimus cream alone and 4 on pimecrolimus cream , 1 % used in sequence with corticosteroids ) .
In 211 subjects on vehicle alone , there were no cases of eczema herpeticum .
The majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in severity .
Two Phase 3 trials were conducted involving 436 infants age 3 months to 23 months .
One 6 - week randomized vehicle - controlled trial with a 20 - week open - label phase and one safety trial , up to one year , were conducted .
In the 6 - week trial , 11 % of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % and 48 % of vehicle subjects did not complete this trial ; no subject in either group discontinued due to adverse events .
Infants on pimecrolimus cream , 1 % had an increased incidence of some adverse events compared to vehicle .
In the 6 - week vehicle - controlled trial these adverse events included pyrexia ( 32 % vs . 13 % vehicle ) , URI ( 24 % vs . 14 % ) , nasopharyngitis ( 15 % vs . 8 % ) , gastroenteritis ( 7 % vs . 3 % ) , otitis media ( 4 % vs . 0 % ) , and diarrhea ( 8 % vs . 0 % ) .
In the open - label phase of the trial , for infants who switched to pimecrolimus cream , 1 % from vehicle , the incidence of the above - cited adverse events approached or equaled the incidence of those subjects who remained on pimecrolimus cream , 1 % .
In the 6 month safety data , 16 % of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % and 35 % of vehicle subjects discontinued early and 1 . 5 % of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % and 0 % of vehicle subjects discontinued due to adverse events .
Infants on pimecrolimus cream , 1 % had a greater incidence of some adverse events as compared to vehicle .
These included pyrexia ( 30 % vs . 20 % ) , URI ( 21 % vs . 17 % ) , cough ( 15 % vs . 9 % ) , hypersensitivity ( 8 % vs . 2 % ) , teething ( 27 % vs . 22 % ) , vomiting ( 9 % vs . 4 % ) , rhinitis ( 13 % vs . 9 % ) , viral rash ( 4 % vs . 0 % ) , rhinorrhea ( 4 % vs . 0 % ) , and wheezing ( 4 % vs . 0 % ) .
The systemic exposure to pimecrolimus from pimecrolimus cream , 1 % was investigated in 28 pediatric subjects with atopic dermatitis ( 20 % to 80 % BSA involvement ) between the ages of 8 months to 14 yrs .
Following twice daily application for three weeks , blood concentrations of pimecrolimus were < 2 ng / mL with 60 % ( 96 / 161 ) of the blood samples having blood concentration below the limit of quantification ( 0 . 5 ng / mL ) .
However , more children ( 23 children out of the total 28 children investigated ) had at least one detectable blood level as compared to the adults ( 12 adults out of the total 52 adults investigated ) over a 3 - week treatment period .
Due to the erratic nature of the blood levels observed , no correlation could be made between amount of cream , degree of BSA involvement , and blood concentrations .
In general , the blood concentrations measured in adult atopic dermatitis subjects were comparable to those seen in the pediatric population .
In a second group of 30 pediatric subjects aged 3 to 23 months with 10 % to 92 % BSA involvement , following twice daily application for three weeks , blood concentrations of pimecrolimus were < 2 . 6 ng / mL with 65 % ( 75 / 116 ) of the blood samples having blood concentration below 0 . 5 ng / mL , and 27 % ( 31 / 116 ) below the limit of quantification ( 0 . 1 ng / mL ) for these trials .
Overall , a higher proportion of detectable blood levels was seen in the pediatric subject population as compared to adult population .
This increase in the absolute number of positive blood levels may be due to the larger surface area to body mass ratio seen in these younger subjects .
In addition , a higher incidence of upper respiratory symptoms / infections was also seen relative to the older age group in the PK trials .
At this time , a causal relationship between these findings and pimecrolimus cream , 1 % use cannot be ruled out .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Nine ( 9 ) subjects ≥ 65 years old received pimecrolimus cream , 1 % in Phase 3 trials .
Clinical trials of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to assess efficacy and safety .
11 DESCRIPTION Pimecrolimus Cream , 1 % , for topical use , contains the compound pimecrolimus , the immunosuppressant 33 - epi - chloro - derivative of the macrolactam ascomycin .
Chemically , pimecrolimus is ( 1 R , 9 S , 12 S , 13 S , 14 S , 17 R , 21 S , 23 S , 24 R , 25 S , 27 R ) - 12 - [ ( 1 E ) - 1 - [ ( 1 R , 3 R , 4 S ) - 4 - chloro - 3 - methoxycyclohexyl ] prop - 1 - en - 2 - yl ] - 17 - ethyl - 1 , 14 - dihydroxy - 23 , 25 - dimethoxy - 13 , 19 , 21 , 27 - tetramethyl - 11 , 28 - dioxa - 4 - azatricyclo [ 22 . 3 . 1 . 04 , 9 ] octacos - 18 - ene - 2 , 3 , 10 , 16 - tetrone .
The compound has the empirical formula C43H68CINO11 and the molecular weight of 810 . 45 .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Pimecrolimus is a white to off - white fine crystalline powder .
It is soluble in methanol and dichloromethane and insoluble in water .
Each gram of Pimecrolimus Cream , 1 % contains 10 mg of pimecrolimus in a white to off - white cream base of benzyl alcohol , cetyl alcohol , citric acid anhydrous , mono - and di - glycerides , oleyl alcohol , propylene glycol , sodium cetostearyl sulphate , sodium hydroxide , stearyl alcohol , triglycerides , and water .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of pimecrolimus in atopic dermatitis is not known .
While the following have been observed , the clinical significance of these observations in atopic dermatitis is not known .
It has been demonstrated that pimecrolimus binds with high affinity to macrophilin - 12 ( FKBP - 12 ) and inhibits the calcium - dependent phosphatase , calcineurin .
As a consequence , it inhibits T cell activation by blocking the transcription of early cytokines .
In particular , pimecrolimus inhibits at nanomolar concentrations Interleukin - 2 and interferon gamma ( Th1 - type ) and Interleukin - 4 and Interleukin - 10 ( Th2 - type ) cytokine synthesis in human T - cells .
In addition , pimecrolimus prevents the release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators from mast cells in vitro after stimulation by antigen / IgE .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In adult subjects ( n = 52 ) being treated for atopic dermatitis [ 13 % to 62 % Body Surface Area ( BSA ) involvement ] for periods up to a year , a maximum pimecrolimus concentration of 1 . 4 ng / mL was observed among those subjects with detectable blood levels .
In the majority of samples in adult ( 91 % ; 1 , 244 / 1 , 362 ) subjects , blood concentrations of pimecrolimus were below 0 . 5 ng / mL .
Data on blood levels of pimecrolimus measured in pediatric subjects are described in Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) .
Distribution Laboratory in vitro plasma protein binding studies using equilibrium gel filtration have shown that 99 . 5 % of pimecrolimus in plasma is bound to proteins over the pimecrolimus concentration range of 2 to 100 ng / mL tested .
The major fraction of pimecrolimus in plasma appears to be bound to various lipoproteins .
As with other topical calcineurin inhibitors , it is not known whether pimecrolimus is absorbed into cutaneous lymphatic vessels or in regional lymph nodes .
Metabolism Following the administration of a single oral radiolabeled dose of pimecrolimus numerous circulating O - demethylation metabolites were seen .
Studies with human liver microsomes indicate that pimecrolimus is metabolized in vitro by the CYP3A sub - family of metabolizing enzymes .
No evidence of skin mediated drug metabolism was identified in vivo using the minipig or in vitro using stripped human skin .
Elimination Based on the results of the aforementioned radiolabeled study , following a single oral dose of pimecrolimus ~ 81 % of the administered radioactivity was recovered , primarily in the feces ( 78 . 4 % ) as metabolites .
Less than 1 % of the radioactivity found in the feces was due to unchanged pimecrolimus .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a 2 - year rat dermal carcinogenicity study using pimecrolimus cream , 1 % a statistically significant increase in the incidence of follicular cell adenoma of the thyroid was noted in low , mid and high dose male animals compared to vehicle and saline control male animals .
Follicular cell adenoma of the thyroid was noted in the dermal rat carcinogenicity study at the lowest dose of 2 mg / kg / day [ 0 . 2 % pimecrolimus cream ; 1 . 5 X the Maximum Recommended Human Dose ( MRHD ) based on AUC comparisons ] .
No increase in the incidence of follicular cell adenoma of the thyroid was noted in the oral carcinogenicity study in male rats up to 10 mg / kg / day ( 66 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
However , oral studies may not reflect continuous exposure or the same metabolic profile as by the dermal route .
In a mouse dermal carcinogenicity study using pimecrolimus in an ethanolic solution , no increase in incidence of neoplasms was observed in the skin or other organs up to the highest dose of 4 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 32 % pimecrolimus in ethanol ) 27 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons .
However , lymphoproliferative changes ( including lymphoma ) were noted in a 13 week repeat dose dermal toxicity study conducted in mice using pimecrolimus in an ethanolic solution at a dose of 25 mg / kg / day ( 47 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
No lymphoproliferative changes were noted in this study at a dose of 10 mg / kg / day ( 17 X MRHD based on AUC comparison ) .
However , the latency time to lymphoma formation was shortened to 8 weeks after dermal administration of pimecrolimus dissolved in ethanol at a dose of 100 mg / kg / day ( 179 to 217 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
In a mouse oral ( gavage ) carcinogenicity study , a statistically significant increase in the incidence of lymphoma was noted in high dose male and female animals compared to vehicle control male and female animals .
Lymphomas were noted in the oral mouse carcinogenicity study at a dose of 45 mg / kg / day ( 258 to 340 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
No drug - related tumors were noted in the mouse oral carcinogenicity study at a dose of 15 mg / kg / day ( 60 to 133 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
In an oral ( gavage ) rat carcinogenicity study , a statistically significant increase in the incidence of benign thymoma was noted in 10 mg / kg / day pimecrolimus treated male and female animals compared to vehicle control treated male and female animals .
In addition , a significant increase in the incidence of benign thymoma was noted in another oral ( gavage ) rat carcinogenicity study in 5 mg / kg / day pimecrolimus treated male animals compared to vehicle control treated male animals .
No drug - related tumors were noted in the rat oral carcinogenicity study at a dose of 1 mg / kg / day male animals ( 1 . 1 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) and at a dose of 5 mg / kg / day for female animals ( 21 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
In a 52 - week dermal photo - carcinogenicity study , the median time to onset of skin tumor formation was decreased in hairless mice following chronic topical dosing with concurrent exposure to UV radiation ( 40 weeks of treatment followed by 12 weeks of observation ) with the pimecrolimus cream , 1 % vehicle alone .
No additional effect on tumor development beyond the vehicle effect was noted with the addition of the active ingredient , pimecrolimus , to the vehicle cream .
A 39 - week oral monkey toxicology study was conducted with pimecrolimus doses of 15 , 45 and 120 mg / kg / day .
A dose dependent increase in expression of immunosuppressive - related lymphoproliferative disorder ( IRLD ) associated with lymphocryptovirus ( a monkey strain of virus related to human Epstein Barr virus ) was observed .
IRLD in monkeys mirrors what has been noted in human transplant patients after chronic systemic immunosuppressive therapy , post transplantation lymphoproliferative disease ( PTLD ) , after treatment with chronic systemic immunosuppressive therapy .
Both IRLD and PTLD can progress to lymphoma , which is dependent on the dose and duration of systemic immunosuppressive therapy .
A dose dependent increase in opportunistic infections ( a signal of systemic immunosuppression ) was also noted in this monkey study .
A no observed adverse effect level ( NOAEL ) for IRLD and opportunistic infections was not established in this study .
IRLD occurred at the lowest dose of 15 mg / kg / day for 39 weeks [ 31 X the Maximum Recommended Human Dose ( MRHD ) of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % based on AUC comparisons ] in this study .
A partial recovery from IRLD was noted upon cessation of dosing in this study .
A battery of in vitro genotoxicity tests , including Ames assay , mouse lymphoma L5178Y assay , and chromosome aberration test in V79 Chinese hamster cells and an in vivo mouse micronucleus test revealed no evidence for a mutagenic or clastogenic potential for the drug .
An oral fertility and embryofetal developmental study in rats revealed estrus cycle disturbances , post - implantation loss and reduction in litter size at the 45 mg / kg / day dose ( 38 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
No effect on fertility in female rats was noted at 10 mg / kg / day ( 12 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
No effect on fertility in male rats was noted at 45 mg / kg / day ( 23 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) , which was the highest dose tested in this study .
A second oral fertility and embryofetal developmental study in rats revealed reduced testicular and epididymal weights , reduced testicular sperm counts and motile sperm for males and estrus cycle disturbances , decreased corpora lutea , decreased implantations and viable fetuses for females at 45 mg / kg / day dose ( 123 X MRHD for males and 192 X MRHD for females based on AUC comparisons ) .
No effect on fertility in female rats was noted at 10 mg / kg / day ( 5 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
No effect on fertility in male rats was noted at 2 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 7 X MRHD based on AUC comparisons ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Three randomized , double - blind , vehicle - controlled , multi - center , Phase 3 trials were conducted in 589 pediatric subjects ages 3 months to 17 years old to evaluate pimecrolimus cream , 1 % for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis .
Two of the three trials support the use of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % in subjects 2 years and older with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Three other trials in 1 , 619 pediatric and adult subjects provided additional data regarding the safety of pimecrolimus cream , 1 % in the treatment of atopic dermatitis .
Two of these other trials were vehicle - controlled with optional sequential use of a medium potency topical corticosteroid in pediatric subjects and one trial was an active comparator trial in adult subjects with atopic dermatitis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Two identical 6 - week , randomized , vehicle - controlled , multi - center , Phase 3 trials were conducted to evaluate pimecrolimus cream , 1 % for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis .
A total of 403 pediatric subjects 2 to 17 years old were included in the trials .
The male / female ratio was approximately 50 % and 29 % of the subjects were African American .
At trial entry , 59 % of subjects had moderate disease and the mean body surface area ( BSA ) affected was 26 % .
About 75 % of subjects had atopic dermatitis affecting the face and / or neck region .
In these trials , subjects applied either pimecrolimus cream , 1 % or vehicle cream twice daily to 5 % to 96 % of their BSA for up to 6 weeks .
At endpoint , based on the physician ’ s global evaluation of clinical response , 35 % of subjects treated with pimecrolimus cream , 1 % were clear or almost clear of signs of atopic dermatitis compared to only 18 % of vehicle - treated subjects .
More pimecrolimus cream , 1 % subjects ( 57 % ) had mild or no pruritus at 6 weeks compared to vehicle subjects ( 34 % ) .
The improvement in pruritus occurred in conjunction with the improvement of the subjects ’ atopic dermatitis .
In these two 6 - week trials of pimecrolimus cream , the combined efficacy results at endpoint are presented in Table 2 as follows : Table 2 .
