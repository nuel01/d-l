[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 5 % Dextrose Injection USP provides calories and is a source of water for hydration .
It is capable of inducing diuresis depending on the volume administered and the clinical condition of the patient .
Dextrose is readily metabolized , may decrease losses of body protein and nitrogen , promotes glycogen deposition and decreases or prevents ketosis if sufficient doses are provided .
Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70 % of total body weight .
Average normal adult daily requirements range from two to three liters ( 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production ) .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE 5 % Dextrose Injection USP is indicated for use in adults and pediatric patients as sources of calories and water for hydration .
This product is designed for use as a diluent and delivery system for intermittent intravenous administration of compatible drug additives .
Consult prescribing information for INDICATIONS AND USAGE of drug additives to be administered in this manner .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Solutions containing dextrose may be contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to corn products .
Do not administer 5 % Dextrose Injection USP simultaneously with blood through the same infusion set because hemolysis or pseudoagglutination may occur .
WARNINGS The administration of intravenous solutions can cause fluid and / or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of administered parenteral solutions .
Prolonged infusion of isotonic or hypotonic dextrose in water may increase the volume of extracellular fluid and cause water intoxication .
Solutions containing dextrose without electrolytes should not be administered simultaneously with blood through the same infusion set because of the possibility of agglomeration .
Excessive administration of potassium - free dextrose solutions may result in significant hypokalemia .
Serum potassium levels should be maintained and potassium supplemented as required .
In very low birth weight infants , excessive or rapid administration of dextrose injection may result in increased serum osmolality and possible intracerebral hemorrhage .
PRECAUTIONS General This solution should be used with care in patients with hypervolemia , renal insufficiency , urinary tract obstruction , or impending or frank cardiac decompensation .
Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with overt or known subclinical diabetes mellitus or carbohydrate intolerance for any reason .
To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing this solution with other additives that may be prescribed , the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing , prior to administration , and periodically during administration .
Laboratory Tests Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance , electrolyte concentrations , and acid - base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation .
Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require tailoring of the electrolyte pattern , in this or an alternative solution ( s ) .
Drug Interactions Some additives may be incompatible .
Consult with pharmacist .
When introducing additives , use aseptic techniques .
Mix thoroughly .
Do not store .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Studies with 5 % Dextrose Injection USP have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , mutagenic potential or effects on fertility .
Pregnancy - Teratogenic Effects - Pregnancy Category C . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with 5 % Dextrose Injection USP .
It is also not known whether 5 % Dextrose Injection USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
5 % Dextrose Injection USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Labor and Delivery As reported in the literature , dextrose solutions have been administered during labor and delivery .
Caution should be exercised , and the fluid balance , glucose and electrolyte concentrations and acid - base balance , of both mother and fetus should be evaluated periodically or whenever warranted by the condition of the patient or fetus .
Nursing Mothers Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when 5 % Dextrose Injection USP is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population are based on the similarity of the clinical conditions of the pediatric and adult populations .
In neonates or in very small infants even small volumes of fluid may affect fluid and electrolyte balance .
Care must be exercised in treatment of neonates , especially pre - term neonates , whose renal function may be immature and whose ability to excrete fluid and solute loads may be limited .
Fluid intake , urine output , and serum electrolytes should be monitored closely .
In very low birth weight infants , excessive or rapid administration of dextrose injection may result in increased serum osmolality and possible intracerebral hemorrhage .
Serum glucose concentrations should be frequently monitored when dextrose is prescribed to pediatric patients , particularly infants , neonates , and low birth weight infants .
See WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .
Geriatric Use An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response , infection at the site of injection , venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection , extravasation , and hypervolemia .
The physician should also be alert to the possibility of adverse reactions to drug additives diluted and administered from the plastic partial fill container .
Prescribing information for drug additives to be administered in this manner should be consulted .
If an adverse reaction does occur , discontinue the infusion , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures , and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of a fluid or solute overload , reevaluate the patient ' s condition , and institute appropriate corrective treatment .
The administration of intravenous solutions can cause fluid and / or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of administered parenteral solutions .
Prolonged infusion of isotonic or hypotonic dextrose in water may increase the volume of extracellular fluid and cause water intoxication .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION This solution is for intravenous use only .
As directed by a physician .
Dosage is dependent upon the age , weight , and clinical condition of the patient as well as laboratory determinations .
