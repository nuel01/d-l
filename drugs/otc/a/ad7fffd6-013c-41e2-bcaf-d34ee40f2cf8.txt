( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • LIVTENCITY may antagonize the antiviral activity of ganciclovir and valganciclovir .
Coadministration is not recommended .
( 5 . 1 , 7 . 1 ) • Virologic failure can occur during and after treatment with LIVTENCITY .
Monitor CMV DNA levels and check for resistance if patient does not respond to treatment .
Some maribavir pUL97 resistance - associated substitutions confer cross - resistance to ganciclovir and valganciclovir .
( 5 . 2 , 12 . 4 , 14 . 1 ) • The concomitant use of LIVTENCITY and certain drugs may result in potentially significant drug interactions , some of which may lead to reduced therapeutic effect of LIVTENCITY or adverse reactions of concomitant drugs .
( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 , 7 . 1 , 7 . 2 , 7 . 3 ) • LIVTENCITY has the potential to increase the drug concentrations of immunosuppressant drugs that are CYP3A4 and / or P - gp substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse events ( including tacrolimus , cyclosporine , sirolimus and everolimus ) .
Frequently monitor immunosuppressant drug levels throughout treatment with LIVTENCITY , especially following initiation and after discontinuation of LIVTENCITY and adjust the dose , as needed .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Risk of Reduced Antiviral Activity When Coadministered with Ganciclovir and Valganciclovir LIVTENCITY may antagonize the antiviral activity of ganciclovir and valganciclovir by inhibiting human CMV pUL97 kinase , which is required for activation / phosphorylation of ganciclovir and valganciclovir .
Coadministration of LIVTENCITY with ganciclovir or valganciclovir is not recommended [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) and Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 2 Virologic Failure During Treatment and Relapse Post - Treatment Virologic failure due to resistance can occur during and after treatment with LIVTENCITY .
Virologic relapse during the posttreatment period usually occurred within 4 - 8 weeks after treatment discontinuation .
Some maribavir pUL97 resistance - associated substitutions confer cross - resistance to ganciclovir and valganciclovir .
Monitor CMV DNA levels and check for maribavir resistance if the patient is not responding to treatment or relapses [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 3 Risk of Adverse Reactions or Loss of Virologic Response Due to Drug Interactions The concomitant use of LIVTENCITY and certain drugs may result in potentially significant drug interactions , some of which may lead to reduced therapeutic effect of LIVTENCITY or adverse reactions of concomitant drugs [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
See Table 4 for steps to prevent or manage these possible or known significant drug interactions , including dosing recommendations .
Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during LIVTENCITY therapy ; review concomitant medications during LIVTENCITY therapy and monitor for adverse reactions .
Maribavir is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 .
Drugs that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 are expected to decrease maribavir plasma concentrations and may result in reduced virologic response ; therefore , coadministration of LIVTENCITY with these drugs is not recommended , except for selected anticonvulsants [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
Use with Immunosuppressant Drugs LIVTENCITY has the potential to increase the drug concentrations of immunosuppressant drugs that are CYP3A4 and / or P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse events ( including tacrolimus , cyclosporine , sirolimus and everolimus ) .
Frequently monitor immunosuppressant drug levels throughout treatment with LIVTENCITY , especially following initiation and after discontinuation of LIVTENCITY and adjust the immunosuppressant dose , as needed [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse events ( all grades , > 10 % ) in subjects treated with LIVTENCITY were taste disturbance , nausea , diarrhea , vomiting , and fatigue .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety of LIVTENCITY was evaluated in one Phase 3 multi - center , randomized , open - label , active - control trial in which 352 adult transplant recipients were randomized , and treated with LIVTENCITY ( N = 234 ) or Investigator - Assigned Treatment ( IAT ) consisting of monotherapy or dual therapy with ganciclovir , valganciclovir , foscarnet , or cidofovir as dosed by the investigator ( N = 116 ) for up to 8 - weeks following a diagnosis of CMV infection / disease refractory to treatment ( with or without genotypic resistance ) with ganciclovir , valganciclovir , foscarnet or cidofovir .
The mean treatment durations ( SD ) for LIVTENCITY and IAT were 48 . 6 ( ± 13 . 82 ) and 31 . 2 ( ± 16 . 91 ) days , respectively .
The most common adverse events occurring in more than 10 % of subjects receiving LIVTENCITY are outlined in Table 2 .
Table 2 : Adverse Events ( All Grades ) Reported in > 10 % of Subjects in the LIVTENCITY Group in Trial 303 ADVERSE EVENT LIVTENCITY N = 234 ( % ) IAT [ 1 ] N = 116 ( % ) Taste disturbance [ 2 ] 46 4 Nausea 21 22 Diarrhea 19 21 Vomiting 14 16 Fatigue 12 9 [ 1 ] IAT ( Investigator - Assigned Treatment ) included monotherapy or dual therapy with ganciclovir , valganciclovir , foscarnet , or cidofovir as dosed by the investigator [ 2 ] taste disturbance includes the following reported preferred terms : ageusia , dysgeusia , hypogeusia and taste disorder Similar proportions of subjects experienced serious adverse events ( 38 % in the LIVTENCITY group and 37 % in the IAT group ) .
The most common serious adverse event in both treatment groups occurred in the Infections and Infestations System Organ Class ( SOC ) ( 23 % in the LIVTENCITY group and 15 % in the IAT group ) with CMV infection and disease being the most common in both groups .
A higher proportion of subjects in the IAT group discontinued study medication due to an adverse event compared to the LIVTENCITY group ( 32 % in the IAT group versus 13 % in the LIVTENCITY group ) .
The most commonly reported causes that led to study drug discontinuation were neutropenia ( 9 % ) and acute kidney injury ( 5 % ) in the IAT group and dysgeusia , diarrhea , nausea , and recurrence of underlying disease ( each reported at 1 % ) in the LIVTENCITY group .
Taste disturbance occurred in 46 % of subjects treated with LIVTENCITY .
These events rarely led to discontinuation of LIVTENCITY ( 1 % ) and , for 37 % of the subjects , these events resolved while on therapy ( median duration 43 days ; range 7 to 59 days ) .
For the subjects with ongoing taste disturbance after drug discontinuation , resolution occurred in 89 % .
In subjects with resolution of symptoms after drug discontinuation , the median duration of symptoms off treatment was 6 days ( range 2 to 85 days ) .

[ 1 ] This table is not all inclusive .
[ 2 ] The interaction between LIVTENCITY and the concomitant drug was evaluated in a clinical study [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
[ 3 ] Refer to the respective prescribing information .
7 . 4 Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with LIVTENCITY No clinically significant interactions were observed in clinical drug - drug interaction studies of LIVTENCITY and ketoconazole , antacid , caffeine , S - warfarin , voriconazole , dextromethorphan , or midazolam [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary No adequate human data are available to establish whether LIVTENCITY poses a risk to pregnancy outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , embryo - fetal survival was decreased in rats , but not in rabbits , at maribavir exposures less than those observed in humans at the recommended human dose ( RHD ) ( see Data ) .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In a combined fertility and embryofetal development study , maribavir was administered to male and female rats at oral doses of 100 , 200 , or 400 mg / kg / day .
Females were dosed for 15 consecutive days prior to pairing , throughout pairing , and up to gestation day ( GD ) 17 , while males were dosed 29 days prior to mating and throughout mating .
A decrease in the number of viable fetuses and increase in early resorptions and post - implantation losses were observed at ≥ 100 mg / kg / day ( at exposures approximately half the human exposure at the RHD ) .
Intermittent reduced body weight gain was observed in pregnant animals at ≥ 200 mg / kg / day .
Maribavir had no effect on embryo - fetal growth or development at dose levels up to 400 mg / kg / day , at exposures similar to those observed in humans at the RHD .
No significant toxicological effects on embryo - fetal growth or development were observed in rabbits when maribavir was administered at oral doses up to 100 mg / kg / day from GD 8 to 20 , at exposures approximately half the human exposure at the RHD .
In the pre - and postnatal developmental toxicity study maribavir was administered to pregnant rats at oral doses of 50 , 150 , or 400 mg / kg / day from GD 7 to postnatal day ( PND ) 21 .
A delay in developmental milestones was observed , including pinna detachment at doses ≥ 150 mg / kg / day and eye opening and preputial separation associated with reduced bodyweight gain of the offspring at 400 mg / kg / day .
In addition , decreased fetal survival and litter loss was observed due to maternal toxicity and poor maternal care , respectively , at doses ≥ 150 mg / kg / day .
No effects were observed at 50 mg / kg / day ( which is estimated to be less than the human exposure at the RHD ) .
No effects on number of offspring , proportion of males , number of live pups , or survival to PND 4 were observed at any dose in the offspring born to the second generation .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether maribavir or its metabolites are present in human or animal milk , affect milk production , or have effects on the breastfed infant .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for LIVTENCITY and any potential adverse effects to the breast - fed child .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The recommended dosing regimen in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 35 kg is the same as that in adults .
Use of LIVTENCITY in this age group is based on the following : • Evidence from controlled studies of LIVTENCITY in adults • Population pharmacokinetic ( PK ) modeling and simulation demonstrating that age and body weight had no clinically meaningful effect on plasma exposures of LIVTENCITY • LIVTENCITY exposure is expected to be similar between adults and children 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 35 kg • The course of the disease is similar between adults and pediatric patients to allow extrapolation of data in adults to pediatric patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] The safety and effectiveness of LIVTENCITY have not been established in children younger than 12 years of age .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No dosage adjustment is required for patients over 65 years of age based on the results from population pharmacokinetics analysis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] and efficacy and safety data from the clinical studies .
In the clinical Study 303 , 54 patients aged 65 years and over were treated with LIVTENCITY .
Safety , effectiveness , and pharmacokinetics were consistent between elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) and younger patients ( < 65 years ) .
8 . 6 Impaired Renal Function No dose adjustment of LIVTENCITY is needed for patients with mild , moderate , or severe renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Administration of LIVTENCITY in patients with end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , including patients on dialysis , has not been studied .
8 . 7 Impaired Hepatic Function No dose adjustment of LIVTENCITY is needed for patients with mild ( Child - Pugh Class A ) or moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B ) hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Administration of LIVTENCITY in patients with severe hepatic impairment has not been studied .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known specific antidote for LIVTENCITY .
In case of overdose , it is recommended that the patient be monitored for adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted .
Due to the high plasma protein binding of LIVTENCITY , dialysis is unlikely to reduce plasma concentrations of LIVTENCITY significantly .
11 DESCRIPTION LIVTENCITY tablets contain maribavir , a benzimidazole riboside CMV pUL97 protein kinase inhibitor .
The chemical name of maribavir is 5 , 6 - Dichloro - N - ( 1 - methylethyl ) - 1 - β - L - ribofuranosyl - 1 H - benzimidazol - 2 - amine and the structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The molecular formula for maribavir is C15H19Cl2N3O4 and its molecular weight is 376 . 23 .
Each 200 mg tablet for oral administration contains 200 mg maribavir and the following inactive ingredients : FD & C Blue # 1 , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose , polyethylene glycol , polyvinyl alcohol , sodium starch glycolate , titanium dioxide , and talc .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action LIVTENCITY is an antiviral drug against human CMV [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure - response In dose - ranging studies that evaluated doses of 400 mg twice daily and twice daily doses of two and three times the recommended dose , no exposure - response relationship was observed for viral load or probability of unquantifiable plasma CMV DNA .
In Phase 3 Trial 303 that evaluated a maribavir dose of 400 mg twice daily , increasing maribavir exposure was not associated with increased probability of confirmed plasma CMV DNA < LLOQ ( lower limit of quantification ) at Week 8 .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At three times the recommended dose ( approximately twice the peak concentration observed following the recommended dose ) , LIVTENCITY does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics LIVTENCITY pharmacological activity is due to the parent drug .
Following oral administration , plasma maribavir exposure ( Cmax and AUC ) increased approximately dose - proportionally following a single dose of 50 to 1600 mg ( 0 . 125 to four times the recommended dose ) and multiple doses up to 2400 mg per day ( three times the recommended daily dose ) .
Maribavir PK is time - independent .
With twice - daily dosing , steady state is reached within 2 days , with mean accumulation ratios of Cmax and AUC ranging from 1 . 37 to 1 . 47 .
The pharmacokinetic properties of maribavir following administration of LIVTENCITY are displayed in Table 5 .
The multiple - dose pharmacokinetic parameters are provided in Table 6 .

[ 2 ] tau is maribavir dosing interval : 12 hours Specific Populations There were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of maribavir based on age ( 18 - 79 years ) , gender , race ( Caucasian , Black , Asian , or others ) , ethnicity ( Hispanic / Latino or non - Hispanic / Latino ) , body weight ( 36 to 141 kg ) , mild to severe renal impairment ( measured creatinine clearance ranging from 12 to 70 mL / min ) , or mild to moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A or B ) .
Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of maribavir in patients less than 18 years of age have not been evaluated .
Using modeling and simulation , the recommended dosing regimen is expected to result in comparable steady - state plasma exposures of maribavir in patients 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 35 kg as observed in adults [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Drug Interactions Based on in vitro studies , the metabolism of maribavir is not mediated by CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP3A5 , UGT1A4 , UGT1A6 , UGT1A10 , or UGT2B15 .
The transport of maribavir is not mediated by organic anion transporting polypeptide ( OATP ) 1B1 , OATP1B3 , or bile salt export pump ( BSEP ) .
At clinically relevant concentrations , clinically significant interactions are not expected when LIVTENCITY is co - administered with substrates of CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2E1 , CYP2D6 , CYP3A4 ; uridine diphosphate - glucuronosyltransferase ( UGT ) 1A1 , UGT1A4 , UGT1A6 , UGT1A9 , UGT2B7 ; P - gp ; BSEP ; multidrug and toxin extrusion protein ( MATE ) 1 / 2 K ; organic anion transporters ( OAT ) 1 and OAT3 ; organic cation transporters ( OCT ) 1 and OCT2 ; OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 .
In a clinical drug - drug interaction cocktail study , coadministration with maribavir had no effect on substrates of CYP1A2 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , and CYP3A4 .
Drug interaction studies were performed with LIVTENCITY and other drugs likely to be co - administered for pharmacokinetic interactions .

Maribavir inhibited wild - type pUL97 protein kinase in a biochemical assay with an IC50 value of 0 . 003 µM .
Maribavir and its 5 ' - mono - and 5 ' - triphosphate derivatives at 100 µM had no significant effect on the incorporation of deoxynucleoside triphosphates by human CMV DNA polymerase .
At a concentration of 100 µM , neither maribavir nor its 5 ′ - triphosphate derivative inhibited CMV DNA polymerase delta , however the 5 ′ - monophosphate derivative inhibited incorporation by polymerase delta of all 4 natural dNTPs by approximately 55 % .
Antiviral Activity Maribavir inhibited human CMV replication in virus yield reduction , DNA hybridization , and plaque reduction assays in human lung fibroblast cell line ( MRC - 5 ) , human embryonic kidney ( HEK ) , and human foreskin fibroblast ( MRHF ) cells .
The EC50 values ranged from 0 . 03 to 2 . 2 µM depending on the cell line and assay endpoint .
The cell culture antiviral activity of maribavir has also been evaluated against CMV clinical isolates .
The median EC50 values were 0 . 1 µM ( n = 10 , range 0 . 03 - 0 . 13 µM ) and 0 . 28 µM ( n = 10 , range 0 . 12 - 0 . 56 µM ) using DNA hybridization and plaque reduction assays , respectively .
No significant difference in EC50 values across the four human CMV glycoprotein B genotypes ( N = 2 , 1 , 4 , and 1 for gB1 , gB2 , gB3 , and gB4 , respectively ) was seen .
Combination Antiviral Activity When maribavir was tested in combination with other antiviral compounds , antagonism of the antiviral activity was seen in combination with ganciclovir .
No antagonism was observed with cidofovir , foscarnet , letermovir and rapamycin at the drugs EC50 values .
The pUL97 kinase activity inhibited by maribavir is necessary to activate valganciclovir / ganciclovir .
Viral Resistance In Cell Culture Selection of maribavir resistant virus in cell culture and genotypic plus phenotypic characterization of these has identified amino acid substitutions that confer reduced susceptibility to maribavir .
Substitutions identified in pUL97 include L337M , V353A , L397R , T409M , and H411L / N / Y .
These substitutions confer reductions in susceptibility that range from 3 . 5 - fold to > 200 - fold .
Substitutions were also identified in pUL27 : R233S , W362R , W153R , L193F , A269T , V353E , L426F , E22stop , W362stop , 218 delC , and 301 - 311 del .
These substitutions confer reductions in susceptibility that range from 1 . 7 - to 4 . 8 - fold .
In Clinical Studies In Phase 2 Study 202 evaluating maribavir in 120 hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) or solid organ transplant ( SOT ) recipients with phenotypic resistance to valganciclovir / ganciclovir , DNA sequence analysis of a select region of pUL97 ( amino acids 270 to 482 ) and pUL27 ( amino acids 108 to 424 ) was performed on 34 paired virologic failure samples .
There were 25 patients with treatment - emergent maribavir resistance - associated substitution ( s ) in pUL97 F342Y ( 4 . 5 - fold reduction in susceptibility ) , T409M ( 78 - fold reduction ) , H411L / Y ( 69 - and 12 - fold reduction ) and / or C480F ( 224 - fold reduction ) .
In Phase 3 Study 303 evaluating maribavir in patients with phenotypic resistance to valganciclovir / ganciclovir , DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding regions of pUL97 and pUL27 was performed on 134 paired sequences from maribavir - treated patients .
The treatment - emergent pUL97 substitutions F342Y ( 4 . 5 - fold ) , T409M ( 78 - fold ) , H411L / N / Y ( 69 - , 9 - , and 12 - fold , respectively ) , and / or C480F ( 224 - fold ) were detected in 58 subjects ( 47 subjects were on - treatment failures and 11 subjects were relapsers ) .
One subject with the pUL27 L193F substitution ( 2 . 6 - fold reduced susceptibility to maribavir ) at baseline did not meet the primary endpoint .
Cross Resistance Cross - resistance has been observed between maribavir and ganciclovir / valganciclovir in cell culture and in clinical studies .
pUL97 valganciclovir / ganciclovir resistance - associated substitutions F342S / Y , K355del , V356G , D456N , V466G , C480R , P521L , and Y617del reduce susceptibility to maribavir > 4 . 5 - fold .
Other vGCV / GCV resistance pathways have not been evaluated for cross - resistance to maribavir .
pUL54 DNA polymerase substitutions conferring resistance to vGCV / GCV , cidofovir , or foscarnet remained susceptible to maribavir .
Substitutions pUL97 F342Y and C480F are maribavir treatment - emergent resistance - associated substitutions that confer > 1 . 5 - fold reduced susceptibility to vGCV / GCV , a fold reduction that is associated with phenotypic resistance to vGCV / GCV .
The clinical significance of this cross - resistance to vGCV / GCV for these substitutions has not been determined .
Maribavir resistant virus remained susceptible to cidofovir and foscarnet .
Additionally , there are no reports of any pUL27 maribavir resistance - associated substitutions being evaluated for vGCV / GCV , cidofovir , or foscarnet cross - resistance .
Given the lack of resistance - associated substitutions for these drugs mapping to pUL27 , cross - resistance is not expected for pUL27 maribavir substitutions .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Two - year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and rats administered oral doses up to 150 and 100 mg / kg / day , respectively .
Maribavir was not carcinogenic in rats at any dose tested , corresponding to maribavir exposures less than human exposure at the RHD .
At 150 mg / kg / day in male mice only , an increased incidence of hemangioma , hemangiosarcoma , and combined hemangioma / hemangiosarcoma was observed across multiple tissues , at exposures less than the human exposure at the RHD .
There were no carcinogenic findings in male mice at ≤ 75 mg / kg / day and female mice at any dose .
Mutagenicity Maribavir was negative in a bacterial mutation assay and the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus assay .
Maribavir was positive in the absence of metabolic activation in the mouse lymphoma assay , and the results were equivocal in the presence of metabolic activation .
Impairment of Fertility Although decreased sperm straight line velocity was observed in males ( at maribavir exposures less than those observed in humans at the RHD ) , there were no effects on fertility in males or females in a combined oral fertility and embryo - fetal study in rats administered maribavir at up to 400 mg / kg / day [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Treatment of Adults with Post - transplant CMV Infection / Disease That Is Refractory ( with or without Genotypic Resistance ) to Ganciclovir , Valganciclovir , Cidofovir , or Foscarnet LIVTENCITY was evaluated in a Phase 3 , multicenter , randomized , open - label , active - controlled superiority trial ( NCT02931539 , Trial 303 ) to assess the efficacy and safety of LIVTENCITY compared to Investigator - Assigned Treatment ( IAT ) ( ganciclovir , valganciclovir , foscarnet , or cidofovir ) in 352 HSCT or SOT recipients with CMV infections that were refractory to treatment with ganciclovir , valganciclovir , foscarnet , or cidofovir , including CMV infections with or without confirmed resistance to 1 or more of the IATs .
Subjects with CMV disease involving the central nervous system , including the retina , were excluded from the study .
Subjects were stratified by transplant type ( HSCT or SOT ) and screening CMV DNA levels and then randomized in a 2 : 1 allocation ratio to receive either LIVTENCITY 400 mg twice daily or IAT as dosed by the investigator for up to 8 weeks .
After completion of the treatment period , subjects entered a 12 - week follow - up phase .
The mean age of trial subjects was 53 years and most subjects were male ( 61 % ) , white ( 76 % ) and not Hispanic or Latino ( 83 % ) , with similar distributions across the two treatment arms .
The most common treatment used in the IAT arm was foscarnet which was administered in 47 ( 41 % ) subjects followed by ganciclovir or valganciclovir , each administered in 28 ( 24 % ) subjects .
Cidofovir was administered in 6 subjects , the combination of foscarnet and valganciclovir in 4 subjects and the combination of foscarnet and ganciclovir in 3 subjects .
Baseline disease characteristics are summarized in Table 9 below .
