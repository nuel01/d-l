Administer SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION with the patient in an upright position .
5 . 5 Binding to Other Orally Administered Medications SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION may bind orally administered medications , which could decrease their gastrointestinal absorption and lead to reduced efficacy .
Administer other oral medications at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION .
Patients with gastroparesis may require a 6 hour separation .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Take other orally administered drugs at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION ( 7 . 1 ) .
• Cation - Donating Antacids : may reduce the resin ' s potassium exchange capability and increase risk of systemic alkalosis ( 7 . 2 ) .
• Sorbitol : Concomitant use may contribute to the risk of intestinal necrosis and is not recommended ( 7 . 3 ) .
7 . 1 General Interactions No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted in humans .
SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION has the potential to bind other drugs .
In in vitro binding studies , SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION was shown to significantly bind the oral medications ( n = 6 ) that were tested .
Decreased absorption of lithium and thyroxine have also been reported with co - administration of SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION .
Binding of SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION to other oral medications could cause decreased gastrointestinal absorption and loss of efficacy when taken close to the time SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION is administered .
Administer SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION at least 3 hours before or 3 hours after other oral medications .
Patients with gastroparesis may require a 6 hour separation .
Monitor for clinical response and / or blood levels where possible .
7 . 2 Cation - Donating Antacids The simultaneous oral administration of SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION with nonabsorbable cation - donating antacids and laxatives may reduce the resin ' s potassium exchange capability and increase the risk of systemic alkalosis .
7 . 3 Sorbitol Sorbitol may contribute to the risk of intestinal necrosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] and concomitant use is not recommended .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION is not absorbed systemically following oral or rectal administration and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal risk .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION is not absorbed systemically by the mother , so breastfeeding is not expected to result in risk to the infant .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Studies of safety and efficacy have not been conducted in pediatric patients .
In pediatric patients , as in adults , SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION is expected to bind potassium at the practical exchange ratio of 1 mEq potassium per 1 gram of resin .
In neonates , SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION should not be given by the oral route .
In both children and neonates , excessive dosage or inadequate dilution could result in impaction of the resin .
Premature infants or low birth weight infants may have an increased risk for gastrointestinal adverse effects with SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION use [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage may result in electrolyte disturbances including hypokalemia , hypocalcemia , and hypomagnesemia .
Appropriate measures should be taken to correct serum electrolytes ( potassium , calcium , magnesium ) , and the resin should be removed from the alimentary tract by appropriate use of laxatives or enemas .
11 DESCRIPTION SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION is a benzene , diethenyl - polymer , with ethenylbenzene , sulfonated , sodium salt and has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The drug is a light brown to brown , finely ground , powdered form of sodium polystyrene sulfonate , a cation - exchange resin prepared in the sodium phase with an in vitro exchange capacity of approximately 3 . 1 mEq ( in vivo approximately 1 mEq ) of potassium per gram .
The sodium content is approximately 100 mg ( 4 . 1 mEq ) per gram of the drug .
It can be administered orally or rectally as an enema .
One gram of SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION contains 4 . 1 mEq of sodium .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION is a non - absorbed , cation exchange polymer that contains a sodium counterion .
SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION increases fecal potassium excretion through binding of potassium in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract .
Binding of potassium reduces the concentration of free potassium in the gastrointestinal lumen , resulting in a reduction of serum potassium levels .
The practical exchange ratio is 1 mEq K per 1 gram of resin .
As the resin passes along the intestine or is retained in the colon after administration by enema , the sodium ions are partially released and are replaced by potassium ions .
This action occurs primarily in the large intestine , which excretes potassium ions to a greater degree than does the small intestine .
The efficiency of this process is limited and unpredictably variable .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The effective lowering of serum potassium with SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION may take hours to days .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The in vivo efficiency of sodium - potassium exchange resins is approximately 33 percent ; hence , about one third of the resin ' s actual sodium content is delivered to the body .
SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION is not absorbed systemically .
Drug Interactions In vitro binding studies showed that SODIUM POLYSTYRENE SULFONATE FOR SUSPENSION bound significantly to the following tested drugs – warfarin , metoprolol , phenytoin , furosemide , amlodipine and amoxicillin .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Studies have not been performed .
