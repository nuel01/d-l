DESCRIPTION Fludeoxyglucose F18 Injection , USP is a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical containing no - carrier added radioactive 2 - deoxy - 2 - [ 18 F ] fluoro - D - glucose that is used for diagnostic purposes in conjunction with Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) .
It is administered by intravenous injection .
The active ingredient 2 - deoxy - 2 - [ 18 F ] fluoro - D - glucose , abbreviated [ 18 F ] FDG , has a molecular formula of C8H1118F08 with a molecular weight of 181 . 26 daltons , and has the following chemical structure .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Fludeoxyglucose F18 Injection , USP is provided as a ready to use sterile , pyrogen free , clear , colorless solution .
Each milliliter contain between 150 to 1850 MBq ( 4 — 500 mCi ) of 2 - deoxy - 2 - [ 18 F ] fluoro - D - glucose at the end of synthesis ( EOS ) , and 9 mg of sodium chloride in citrate buffer .
The pH of the solution is between 4 . 5 to 7 . 5 .
The solution is packaged in a multiple - dose glass vial and does not contain any preservative .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS Fluorine F 18 decays by positron ( + ) emission and has a half life of 110 minutes .
The principal photons useful for diagnostic imaging are the 511 keV gamma photons , resulting from the interaction of the emitted positron with an electron ( Table 1 ) Table 1 .

EXTERNAL RADIATION The specific gamma ray constant for Fluorine F 18 is 6 . 0 R / hr / mCi ( 0 . 3 Gy / hr / kBq ) at 1 cm .
The half - value layer ( HVL ) for the 511 keV photons is 4 . 1 mm lead ( Pb ) .
A range of values for the attenuation of radiation results from the interposition of various thicknesses of Pb .
The range of attenuation coefficients for this radionuclide is shown in Table 2 .
For example the interposition of an 8 . 3 mm thickness of Pb , with a coefficient of attenuation of 0 . 25 , will decrease the external radiation by 75 % .

The half - lives for the different distribution and elimination phases are 0 . 2 - 0 . 3 min , 10 - 13 min ( mean ± s . d . ; 11 . 6 ± 1 . 1 min ) , and 80 - 95 min ( 88 ± 4 min ) .
Within 33 minutes , a mean of 3 . 9 % of the injected dose can be measured in the urine .
Bladder activity two hours after injection indicates that a mean of 20 . 6 % of the injected dose is present .
See the Metabolism Section for additional clearance times .
Metabolism [ 18 F ] FDG is taken up by cells and phosphorylated to [ 18 F ] FDG - 6 - phosphate at a rate proportional to the rate of glucose utilization within a given tissue .
[ 18 F ] FDG - 6 - phosphate presumably is metabolized to 2 - deoxy - 2 - [ 18 F ] fluoro - 6 - phospho - D - mannose ( [ 18 F ] FDM - 6 - phosphate ) .
[ 18 F ] FDG may contain 2 - deoxy - 2 - chloro - D - glucose ( C1DG ) as an impurity .
Distribution and metabolism of C1DG are presumably similar to that of [ 18 F ] FDG , and would be expected to result in intracellular formation of 2 - deoxy - 2 - chloro - 6 - phospho - D - g14icose ( C1DG - 6 - phosphate ) and 2 - deoxy - 2 - chloro - 6 - phospho - D - mannose ( CIDM - 6 - phosphate ) .
The phosphorylated deoxyglucose compounds are dephosphorylated , and the resulting compounds , ( FDG , FDM , C1DG and C1DM ) presumably leave cells by passive diffusion .
FDG and related compounds are cleared from non - cardiac tissues within 3 to 24 hours after administration ; clearance from the heart may require more than 96 hours .
[ 18 F ] FDG that is not involved in glucose metabolism is excreted unchanged in the urine .
Pharmacodynamics [ 18 F ] FDG is a glucose analogue which concentrates in cells that rely upon glucose as a primary energy source .
Once in the cell it is phosphorylated and can not exit until dephosphorylation has occurred .
Regions of “ increased [ 18 F ] FDG uptake " correlate with increased glucose metabolism .
Regions of decreased / absent uptake reflect the absence of glucose metabolism .
Background activity reflects uptake by normal cells .
[ 18 F ] FDG uptake in inflammatory cells is inconsistent and may be increased , normal or decreased .
Whether or not [ 18 F ] FDG , CIDG , or their metabolites can inhibit glucose metabolism is not known .
CLINICAL TRIALS In a prospective , open label trial , [ 18 F ] FDG was evaluated in 86 patients with epilepsy .
Each patient received a dose of [ 18 F ] FDG in the range of 185 - 370 MBq ( 5 - 10 ) mCi .
Demographic characteristics of race and gender are not available .
The mean age was 16 . 4 years ( range : 4 months - 58 years ; of these , 42 patients were < 12 years and 16 patients were < 2 years old ) .
Patients had a known diagnosis of complex partial epilepsy and were under evaluation as surgical candidates for treatment of their seizure disorder .
Seizure foci had been previously identified on ictal EEGs and sphenoidal EEGs .
In 16 % ( 14 / 87 ) of patients , the pre - [ 18 F ] FDG findings were confirmed by [ 18 F ] FDG ; 34 % ( 30 / 87 ) of patients , [ 18 F ] FDG scans provided new findings .
In 32 % ( 27 / 87 ) , [ 18 F ] FDG scans were not definitive .
The influence of these findings on surgical outcome ; medical management or behavior is not known .
In several other studies comparing [ 18 F ] FDG scan results to subsphenoidal EEG , MRI and / or surgical findings , the degree of hypometabolism corresponded to areas of confirmed epileptogenic foci .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection , USP is indicated in PET ( positron emission tomography ) for : 1 .
Identification of regions of abnormal glucose metabolism associated with foci of epileptic seizures .
2 .
Assessment of abnormal glucose metabolism to assist in the evaluation of malignancy in patients with known or suspected abnormalities found by other testing modalities , or in patients with an existing diagnosis of cancer .
3 .
Assessment of patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction , when used together with myocardial perfusion imaging , for the identification of left ventricular myocardium with residual glucose metabolism and reversible loss of systolic function .
Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection , USP is not indicated for distinguishing epileptogenic foci from brain tumors or other brain lesions which may cause seizures .
WARNINGS None known CONTRAINDICATIONS None known PRECAUTIONS General [ 18 F ] FDG uptake may be changed by fasting or by blood sugar changes associated with diabetic mellitus .
Blood glucose levels should be stabilized in non - diabetic patients by fasting before [ 18 F ] FDG injection .
Diabetic patients may need stabilization of blood glucose on the day preceding , and on the day of the [ 18 F ] FDG scan .
Patients should be monitored for arrhythmias and other manifestations of ischemia .
[ 18 F ] FDG , CIDG and their metabolites theoretically could inhibit glucose metabolism .
Their ability to potentiate the arrhythmogenic effects of ischemia has not been studied .
The contents of each vial are sterile and non - pyrogenic .
To maintain sterility , aseptic technique must be used during all operations involved in the manipulation and administration of [ 18 F ] FDG .
[ 18 F ] FDG should be used within 12 hours of the end of synthesis ( EOS ) .
As with any other radioactive material , appropriate shielding should be used to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure to the patient , occupational workers , and other persons .
Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by physicians who are qualified by specific training in the safe use and handling of radionuclides .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Studies with [ 18 F ] FDG have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , mutagenic potential or effects on fertility .
Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with [ 18 F ] FDG .
It is not known whether [ 18 F ] FDG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Therefore , [ 18 F ] FDG should not be administered to a pregnant woman unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when [ 18 F ] FDG is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use See Clinical Trials Section .
