1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Kerendia is indicated to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline , end - stage kidney disease , cardiovascular death , non - fatal myocardial infarction , and hospitalization for heart failure in adult patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) associated with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) .
• Kerendia is a non - steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist ( MRA ) indicated to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline , end stage kidney disease , cardiovascular death , non - fatal myocardial infarction , and hospitalization for heart failure in adult patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) associated with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • • The recommended starting dosage is 10 mg or 20 mg orally once daily based on estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) and serum potassium thresholds .
( 2 . 1 ) • • Increase dosage after 4 weeks to the target dose of 20 mg once daily , based on eGFR and serum potassium thresholds .
( 2 . 3 ) • • Tablets may be taken with or without food ( 2 . 2 ) 2 . 1 Prior to Initiation of Kerendia Measure serum potassium levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) before initiation .
Do not initiate treatment if serum potassium is > 5 . 0 mEq / L [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 2 Recommended Starting Dosage The recommended starting dose of Kerendia is based on eGFR and is presented in Table 1 .
Table 1 : Recommended Starting Dosage eGFR ( mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) Starting Dose ≥ 60 20 mg once daily ≥ 25 to < 60 10 mg once daily < 25 Initiation is not Recommended For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets , Kerendia may be crushed and mixed with water or soft foods such as applesauce immediately prior to use and administered orally [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 3 Monitoring and Dose Adjustment The target daily dose of Kerendia is 20 mg .
Measure serum potassium 4 weeks after initiating treatment and adjust dose ( see Table 2 ) ; if serum potassium levels are > 4 . 8 to 5 . 0 mEq / L , initiation of Kerendia treatment may be considered with additional serum potassium monitoring within the first 4 weeks based on clinical judgment and serum potassium levels [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor serum potassium 4 weeks after a dose adjustment and throughout treatment , and adjust the dose as needed ( see Table 2 ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .

10 mg tablet : pink , with “ FI ” on one side , “ 10 ” on the other side .
20 mg tablet : yellow , with “ FI ” on one side , “ 20 ” on the other side .
• Tablets : 10 mg and 20 mg ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Kerendia is contraindicated in patients : • • Who are receiving concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
• • With adrenal insufficiency .
• • Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors .
( 4 , 7 . 1 ) • • Patients with adrenal insufficiency .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Hyperkalemia .
Patients with decreased kidney function and higher baseline potassium levels are at increased risk .
Monitor serum potassium levels and adjust dose as needed .
( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 , 5 . 1 ) 5 . 1 Hyperkalemia Kerendia can cause hyperkalemia [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The risk for developing hyperkalemia increases with decreasing kidney function and is greater in patients with higher baseline potassium levels or other risk factors for hyperkalemia .
Measure serum potassium and eGFR in all patients before initiation of treatment with Kerendia and dose accordingly [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Do not initiate Kerendia if serum potassium is > 5 . 0 mEq / L .
Measure serum potassium periodically during treatment with Kerendia and adjust dose accordingly [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
More frequent monitoring may be necessary for patients at risk for hyperkalemia , including those on concomitant medications that impair potassium excretion or increase serum potassium [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 , 7 . 2 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling : • • Hyperkalemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 1 % of patients on Kerendia and more frequently than placebo are hyperkalemia , hypotension , and hyponatremia .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety of Kerendia was evaluated in 2 randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , multicenter pivotal phase 3 studies , FIDELIO - DKD and FIGARO - DKD , in which a total of 6510 patients were treated with 10 or 20 mg once daily over a mean duration of 2 . 2 years and 2 . 9 years , respectively .
Overall , serious adverse events occurred in 32 % of patients receiving Kerendia and in 34 % of patients receiving placebo in the FIDELIO - DKD study ; the findings were similar in the FIGARO - DKD study .
Permanent discontinuation due to adverse events also occurred in a similar proportion of patients in the two studies ( 6 - 7 % of patients receiving Kerendia and 5 - 6 % of patients receiving placebo ) .
The most frequently reported ( ≥ 10 % ) adverse reaction in both studies was hyperkalemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Hospitalization due to hyperkalemia for the Kerendia group was 0 . 9 % vs 0 . 2 % in the placebo group across both studies .
Hyperkalemia led to permanent discontinuation of treatment in 1 . 7 % of patients receiving Kerendia versus 0 . 6 % of patients receiving placebo across both studies .
Table 3 shows adverse reactions that occurred more commonly on Kerendia than on placebo , and in at least 1 % of patients treated with Kerendia .
Table 3 : Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 1 % of patients on Kerendia and more frequently than placebo ( pooled data from FIDELIO - DKD and FIGARO - DKD ) Adverse reactions Kerendia N = 6510 n ( % ) Placebo N = 6489 n ( % ) Hyperkalemia 912 ( 14 . 0 ) 448 ( 6 . 9 ) Hypotension 302 ( 4 . 6 ) 194 ( 3 . 9 ) Hyponatremia 82 ( 1 . 3 ) 47 ( 0 . 7 ) Laboratory Test Initiation of Kerendia may cause an initial small decrease in estimated GFR that occurs within the first 4 weeks of starting therapy , and then stabilizes .
In a study that included patients with chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes , this decrease was reversible after treatment discontinuation .
Initiation of Kerendia may also cause a small increase in serum uric acid .
This increase appears to attenuate over time .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • • Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors : Use is contraindicated .
( 7 . 1 ) • • Grapefruit or grapefruit juice : Avoid concomitant use .
( 7 . 1 ) • • Moderate or weak CYP3A4 Inhibitors : Monitor serum potassium during drug initiation or dosage adjustment of either Kerendia or the moderate or weak CYP3A4 inhibitor , and adjust Kerendia dosage as appropriate ( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Effects of other drugs on Kerendia Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors Kerendia is a CYP3A4 substrate .
Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases finerenone exposure [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which may increase the risk of Kerendia adverse reactions .
Concomitant use of Kerendia with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Avoid concomitant intake of grapefruit or grapefruit juice .
Moderate and Weak CYP3A4 Inhibitors Kerendia is a CYP3A4 substrate .
Concomitant use with a moderate or weak CYP3A4 inhibitor increases finerenone exposure [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which may increase the risk of Kerendia adverse reactions .
Monitor serum potassium during drug initiation or dosage adjustment of either Kerendia or the moderate or weak CYP3A4 inhibitor , and adjust Kerendia dosage as appropriate [ see Dosing and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Drug Interaction ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers Kerendia is a CYP3A4 substrate .
Concomitant use of Kerendia with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducer decreases finerenone exposure [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which may reduce the efficacy of Kerendia .
Avoid concomitant use of Kerendia with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers .
7 . 2 Drugs That Affect Serum Potassium More frequent serum potassium monitoring is warranted in patients receiving concomitant therapy with drugs or supplements that increase serum potassium .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Kerendia use in pregnancy to evaluate for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Animal studies have shown developmental toxicity at exposures about 4 times those expected in humans .
( see Data ) .
The clinical significance of these findings is unclear .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In the embryo - fetal toxicity study in rats , finerenone resulted in reduced placental weights and signs of fetal toxicity , including reduced fetal weights and retarded ossification at the maternal toxic dose of 10 mg / kg / day corresponding to an AUCunbound of 19 times that in humans .
At 30 mg / kg / day , the incidence of visceral and skeletal variations was increased ( slight edema , shortened umbilical cord , slightly enlarged fontanelle ) and one fetus showed complex malformations including a rare malformation ( double aortic arch ) at an AUCunbound of about 25 times that in humans .
The doses free of any findings ( low dose in rats , high dose in rabbits ) provide safety margins of 10 to 13 times for the AUCunbound expected in humans .
When rats were exposed during pregnancy and lactation in the pre - and postnatal developmental toxicity study , increased pup mortality and other adverse effects ( lower pup weight , delayed pinna unfolding ) were observed at about 4 times the AUCunbound expected in humans .
In addition , the offspring showed slightly increased locomotor activity , but no other neurobehavioral changes starting at about 4 times the AUCunbound expected in humans .
The dose free of findings provides a safety margin of about 2 times for the AUCunbound expected in humans .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of finerenone or its metabolite in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production .
In a pre - and postnatal developmental toxicity study in rats , increased pup mortality and lower pup weight were observed at about 4 times the AUCunbound expected in humans .
These findings suggest that finerenone is present in rat milk [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) and Data ] .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
Because of the potential risk to breastfed infants from exposure to Kerendia , avoid breastfeeding during treatment and for 1 day after treatment .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Kerendia have not been established in patients below 18 years of age .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 6510 patients who received Kerendia in the FIDELIO - DKD and FIGARO - DKD studies , 55 % of patients were 65 years and older , and 14 % were 75 years and older .
No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these patients and younger patients .
No dose adjustment is required .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Avoid use of Kerendia in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh C ) .
No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh A or B ) .
Consider additional serum potassium monitoring in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh B ) [ see Dosing and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of suspected overdose , immediately interrupt or reduce Kerendia treatment .
The most likely manifestation of overdose is hyperkalemia .
If hyperkalemia develops , standard treatment should be initiated .
Finerenone is unlikely to be efficiently removed by hemodialysis given its fraction bound to plasma proteins of about 90 % .
11 DESCRIPTION Kerendia contains finerenone , a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist .
Finerenone ’ s chemical name is ( 4 S ) - 4 - ( 4 - cyano - 2 - methoxyphenyl ) - 5 - ethoxy - 2 , 8 - dimethyl - 1 , 4 - dihydro - 1 , 6 - naphthyridine - 3 - carboxamide .
The molecular formula is C21H22N4O3 and the molecular weight is 378 . 43 g / mol .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Finerenone is a white to yellow crystalline powder .
It is practically insoluble in water ; and sparingly soluble in 0 . 1 M HCl , ethanol , and acetone .
Each Kerendia tablet contains 10 mg or 20 mg of finerenone .
The inactive ingredients of Kerendia are lactose monohydrate , cellulose microcrystalline , croscarmellose sodium , hypromellose , magnesium stearate , and sodium lauryl sulfate .
The film coating contains hypromellose , titanium dioxide and talc , in addition to ferric oxide red ( 10 mg strength tablets ) or ferric oxide yellow ( 20 mg strength tablets ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Finerenone is a nonsteroidal , selective antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) , which is activated by aldosterone and cortisol and regulates gene transcription .
Finerenone blocks MR mediated sodium reabsorption and MR overactivation in both epithelial ( e . g . , kidney ) and nonepithelial ( e . g . , heart , and blood vessels ) tissues .
MR overactivation is thought to contribute to fibrosis and inflammation .
Finerenone has a high potency and selectivity for the MR and has no relevant affinity for androgen , progesterone , estrogen , and glucocorticoid receptors .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In FIDELIO - DKD and FIGARO - DKD , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , multicenter studies in adult patients with chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes , the placebo - corrected relative reduction in urinary albumin - to - creatinine ratio ( UACR ) in patients randomized to finerenone was 31 % ( 95 % CI 29 - 34 % ) and 32 % ( 95 % CI 30 - 35 % ) respectively at month 4 and remained stable for the duration of the trial .
In ARTS DN , a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , multicenter phase IIb dose finding study in adults with CKD and T2D , the placebo - corrected relative reduction in UACR at Day 90 was 25 % and 38 % in patients treated with finerenone 10 mg and 20 mg once daily , respectively .
In patients treated with Kerendia , the mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 3 mmHg and the mean diastolic blood pressure decreased by 1 - 2 mmHg at month 1 , remaining stable thereafter .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 4 times the maximum approved recommended dose , finerenone does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Finerenone exposure increased proportionally over a dose range of 1 . 25 to 80 mg ( 0 . 06 to 4 times the maximum approved recommended dosage ) .
Steady state of finerenone was achieved after 2 days of dosing .
The estimated steady - state geometric mean Cmax , md was 160 µg / L and steady - state geometric mean AUCτ , md was 686 µg . h / L following administration of finerenone 20 mg to patients .
Absorption Finerenone is completely absorbed after oral administration but undergoes metabolism resulting in absolute bioavailability of 44 % .
Finerenone Cmax was achieved between 0 . 5 and 1 . 25 hours after dosing .
Effect of Food There was no clinically significant effect on finerenone AUC following administration with high fat , high calorie food .
Distribution The volume of distribution at steady - state ( Vss ) of finerenone is 52 . 6 L . Plasma protein binding of finerenone is 92 % , primarily to serum albumin , in vitro .
Elimination The terminal half - life of finerenone is about 2 to 3 hours , and the systemic blood clearance is about 25 L / h .
Metabolism Finerenone is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 ( 90 % ) and to a lesser extent by CYP2C8 ( 10 % ) to inactive metabolites .
Excretion About 80 % of the administered dose is excreted in urine ( < 1 % as unchanged ) and approximately 20 % in feces ( < 0 . 2 % as unchanged ) .
Specific Populations There are no clinically significant effects of age ( 18 to 79 years ) , sex , race / ethnicity ( White , Asian , Black , and Hispanic ) , or weight ( 58 to 121 kg ) on the pharmacokinetics of finerenone .
Renal Impairment There were no clinically relevant differences in finerenone AUC or Cmax values in patients with eGFR 15 to < 90 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 compared to eGFR ≥ 90 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 .
For dosing recommendations based on eGFR and serum potassium levels see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) .
Hepatic Impairment There was no clinically significant effect on finerenone exposure in cirrhotic patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh A ) .
Finerenone mean AUC was increased by 38 % and Cmax was unchanged in cirrhotic patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh B ) compared to healthy control subjects .
The effect of severe hepatic impairment ( Child Pugh C ) on finerenone exposure was not studied .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Model - Informed Approaches Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Concomitant use of itraconazole ( strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ) increased finerenone AUC by > 400 % .
Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors : Concomitant use of erythromycin ( moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor ) increased finerenone mean AUC and Cmax by 248 % and 88 % , respectively .
Weak CYP3A Inhibitors : Concomitant use of amiodarone ( weak CYP3A4 inhibitor ) increased finerenone AUC by 21 % .
Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers : Concomitant use of efavirenz ( moderate CYP3A4 inducer ) and rifampicin ( strong CYP3A4 inducer ) decreased finerenone AUC by 80 % and 90 % , respectively .
Other Drugs : There was no clinically significant difference in finerenone pharmacokinetics when used concomitantly with gemfibrozil ( strong CYP2C8 inhibitor ) , omeprazole ( proton pump inhibitor ) , or an aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide antacid .
There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic differences for either finerenone or concomitant digoxin ( P - gp substrate ) or warfarin ( CYP2C9 substrate ) .
There were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of either midazolam ( CYP3A4 substrate ) or repaglinide ( CYP2C8 substrate ) when used concomitantly with finerenone .
Multiple doses of 40 mg finerenone once - daily had no clinically relevant effect on AUC or Cmax of the BCRP and OATP substrate rosuvastatin .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY Click here to enter Nonclinical Toxicology 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Finerenone was non - genotoxic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay , the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in cultured Chinese hamster V79 cells , or the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice .
In 2 - year carcinogenicity studies , finerenone did not show a statistically significant increase in tumor response in Wistar rats or in CD1 mice .
In male mice , Leydig cell adenoma was numerically increased at a dose representing 26 times the AUCunbound in humans and is not considered clinically relevant .
Finerenone did not impair fertility in male rats but impaired fertility in female rats at 20 times AUC to the maximum human exposure .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES FIDELIO - DKD ( NCT : 02540993 ) and FIGARO - DKD ( NCT : 02545049 ) studies were randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , multicenter studies in adult patients with chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) associated with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) .
In FIDELIO - DKD , patients needed to either have an UACR of 30 to < 300 mg / g , eGFR 25 to < 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 and diabetic retinopathy , or an UACR of ≥ 300 mg / g and an eGFR of 25 to < 75 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 to qualify for enrollment .
In FIGARO - DKD , patients needed to have an UACR of 30 mg / g to < 300 mg / g and an eGFR of 25 to 90 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 , or an UACR ≥ 300 mg / g and an eGFR ≥ 60 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 .
Both trials excluded patients with known significant non - diabetic kidney disease .
All patients were to have a serum potassium ≤ 4 . 8 mEq / L at screening and be receiving standard of care background therapy , including a maximum tolerated labeled dose of an angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitor ( ACEi ) or angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) .
Patients with a clinical diagnosis of chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and persistent symptoms ( New York Heart Association class II to IV ) were excluded .
The starting dose of Kerendia was based on screening eGFR ( 10 mg once daily in patients with an eGFR of 25 to < 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 and 20 mg once daily in patients with an eGFR ≥ 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) .
The dose of Kerendia could be titrated during the study , with a target dose of 20 mg daily .
The primary objective of the FIDELIO - DKD study was to determine whether Kerendia reduced the incidence of a sustained decline in eGFR of ≥ 40 % , kidney failure ( defined as chronic dialysis , kidney transplantation , or a sustained decrease in eGFR to < 15 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 ) , or renal death .
The secondary outcome was a composite of time to first occurrence of CV death , non - fatal MI , non - fatal stroke or hospitalization for heart failure .
The primary objective of the FIGARO - DKD study was to determine whether Kerendia reduced the time to first occurrence of CV death , non - fatal MI , non - fatal stroke or hospitalization for heart failure .
The secondary outcome was a composite of time to kidney failure , a sustained decline in eGFR of 40 % or more compared to baseline over at least 4 weeks , or renal death .
In FIDELIO - DKD , a total of 5674 patients were randomized to receive Kerendia ( N = 2833 ) or placebo ( N = 2841 ) and were followed for a median of 2 . 6 years .
The mean age of the study population was 66 years , and 70 % of patients were male .
This global trial population was 63 % White , 25 % Asian , and 5 % Black ( 24 % Black in the US ) .
At baseline , the mean eGFR was 44 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 , with 55 % of patients having an eGFR < 45 mL / min / 1 . 73m2 .
Median urine albumin - to - creatinine ratio ( UACR ) was 852 mg / g , mean glycated hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) was 7 . 7 % .
and the mean blood pressure was 138 / 76 mmHg .
Approximately 46 % of patients had a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 8 % had a history of heart failure .
At baseline , 99 . 8 % of patients were treated with an ACEi or ARB .
Approximately 97 % were on an antidiabetic agent ( insulin [ 64 . 1 % ] , biguanides [ 44 % ] , glucagon - like peptide - 1 [ GLP - 1 ] receptor agonists [ 7 % ] , sodium - glucose cotransporter 2 [ SGLT2 ] inhibitors [ 5 % ] ) , 74 % were on a statin , and 57 % were on an antiplatelet agent .
In FIGARO - DKD , a total of 7352 patients were randomized to receive Kerendia ( N = 3683 ) or placebo ( N = 3666 ) and were followed for 3 . 4 years .
As compared to FIDELIO - DKD , baseline eGFR was higher in FIGARO - DKD ( mean eGFR 68 , with 62 % of patients having an eGFR ≥ 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) and median UACR was lower ( 308 mg / g ) .
Otherwise , baseline patient characteristics and background therapies were similar in the two trials .
In FIDELIO - DKD , Kerendia reduced the incidence of the primary composite endpoint of a sustained decline in eGFR of ≥ 40 % , kidney failure , or renal death ( HR 0 . 82 , 95 % CI 0 . 73 - 0 . 93 , p = 0 . 001 ) as shown in Table 4 and Figure 1 .
The treatment effect reflected a reduction in a sustained decline in eGFR of ≥ 40 % and progression to kidney failure .
There were few renal deaths during the trial .
Kerendia also reduced the incidence of the secondary composite endpoint of cardiovascular ( CV ) death , non - fatal myocardial infarction ( MI ) , non - fatal stroke or hospitalization for heart failure ( HR 0 . 86 , 95 % CI 0 . 75 - 0 . 99 , p = 0 . 034 ) as shown in Table 4 and Figure 3 .
The treatment effect reflected a reduction in CV death , non - fatal MI , and hospitalization for heart failure .
The treatment effect on the primary and secondary composite endpoints was generally consistent across subgroups .
In FIGARO - DKD , Kerendia reduced the incidence of the primary composite endpoint of CV death , non - fatal MI , non - fatal stroke or hospitalization for heart failure ( HR 0 . 87 , 95 % CI 0 . 76 - 0 . 98 , p = 0 . 026 ) as shown in Table 4 and Figure 4 .
The treatment effect was mainly driven by an effect on hospitalization for heart failure , though CV death also contributed to the treatment effect .
The treatment effect on the primary composite endpoint was generally consistent across subgroups , including patients with and without pre - existing cardiovascular disease .
The findings for the renal composite endpoint are shown in Table 4 and Figure 2 .
