( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Liver Enzyme Elevations : Monitor monthly and discontinue for persistent elevations .
( 5 . 2 ) • Zinc Deficiency : Monitor during therapy and supplement for deficiency .
( 5 . 3 ) • Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm .
( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Agranulocytosis and Neutropenia Fatal agranulocytosis can occur with FERRIPROX use .
FERRIPROX can also cause neutropenia , which may foreshadow agranulocytosis .
Measure the absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) before starting FERRIPROX therapy and monitor it weekly while on therapy .
Interrupt FERRIPROX therapy if neutropenia develops ( ANC < 1 . 5 x 109 / L ) .
Interrupt FERRIPROX if infection develops and monitor the ANC frequently .
Advise patients taking FERRIPROX to immediately interrupt therapy and report to their physician if they experience any symptoms indicative of infection .
The incidence of agranulocytosis was 1 . 7 % of patients in pooled clinical trials of 642 patients with thalassemia syndromes and 1 . 5 % of patients in pooled clinical trials of 196 patients with sickle cell disease or other anemias .
The mechanism of FERRIPROX - associated agranulocytosis is unknown .
Agranulocytosis and neutropenia usually resolve upon discontinuation of FERRIPROX , but there have been reports of agranulocytosis leading to death .
Implement a plan to monitor for and to manage agranulocytosis and neutropenia prior to initiating FERRIPROX treatment .
For agranulocytosis ( ANC < 0 . 5 x 109 / L ) : Consider hospitalization and other management as clinically appropriate .
Do not resume FERRIPROX in patients who have developed agranulocytosis unless potential benefits outweigh potential risks .
Do not rechallenge patients who have developed neutropenia with FERRIPROX unless potential benefits outweigh potential risks .
For neutropenia ( ANC < 1 . 5 x 109 / L and > 0 . 5 x 109 / L ) : Instruct the patient to immediately discontinue FERRIPROX and all other medications with a potential to cause neutropenia .
Obtain a complete blood cell ( CBC ) count , including a white blood cell ( WBC ) count corrected for the presence of nucleated red blood cells , an absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) , and a platelet count daily until recovery ( ANC ≥ 1 . 5 x 109 / L ) .
5 . 2 Liver Enzyme Elevations In pooled clinical trials , 7 . 5 % of 642 patients with thalassemia syndromes treated with FERRIPROX developed increased ALT values .
Four ( 0 . 62 % ) FERRIPROX - treated subjects discontinued the drug due to increased serum ALT levels and 1 ( 0 . 16 % ) due to an increase in both ALT and AST .
In pooled clinical trials , 7 . 7 % of 196 patients with sickle cell disease or other anemias treated with FERRIPROX developed increased ALT values .
Monitor serum ALT values monthly during therapy with FERRIPROX and consider interruption of therapy if there is a persistent increase in the serum transaminase levels .
5 . 3 Zinc Deficiency Decreased plasma zinc concentrations have been observed on FERRIPROX therapy .
Monitor plasma zinc , and supplement in the event of a deficiency .
5 . 4 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal reproduction studies and evidence of genotoxicity , FERRIPROX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
The available data on the use of FERRIPROX in pregnant women are insufficient to inform risk .
In animal studies , administration of deferiprone during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo - fetal death and malformations at doses lower than equivalent human clinical doses .
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with FERRIPROX and for at least six months after the last dose .
Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with FERRIPROX and for at least three months after the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .

( 7 . 1 ) • UGT1A6 Inhibitors : Avoid co - administration .
( 7 . 2 ) • Polyvalent Cations : Allow at least a 4 - hour interval between administration of FERRIPROX and drugs or supplements containing polyvalent cations ( e . g . , iron , aluminum , or zinc ) .
( 2 . 2 , 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Drugs Associated with Neutropenia or Agranulocytosis Avoid co - administration of FERRIPROX with other drugs known to be associated with neutropenia or agranulocytosis .
If co - administration is unavoidable , closely monitor the absolute neutrophil count [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
7 . 2 Effect of Other Drugs on FERRIPROX UDP - Glucuronosyltransferases ( UGT ) Avoid use of UGT1A6 inhibitors ( e . g . , diclofenac , probenecid , or silymarin ( milk thistle ) ) with FERRIPROX [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Polyvalent Cations Deferiprone has the potential to bind polyvalent cations ( e . g . , iron , aluminum , and zinc ) ; allow at least a 4 - hour interval between FERRIPROX and other medications ( e . g . , antacids ) , or supplements containing these polyvalent cations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONs Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of deferiprone to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses 33 % and 49 % , respectively , of the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) resulted in structural abnormalities , embryo - fetal mortality and alterations to growth ( see Data ) .
The limited available data from deferiprone use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug - associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage .
Based on evidence and developmental toxicity in animal studies , FERRIPROX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data Post - marketing data available from 39 pregnancies of deferiprone - treated patients and 10 pregnancies of partners of deferiprone - treated patients are as follows : Of the 39 pregnancies in deferiprone - treated patients , 23 resulted in healthy newborns , 6 ended in spontaneous abortion , 9 had unknown outcomes , and 1 infant was born with anal atresia , nephroptosis , ventricular septal defect , hemivertebra and urethral fistula .
Of the 10 pregnancies in partners of deferiprone - treated patients , 5 resulted in healthy newborns , 1 resulted in a healthy newborn with slight hypospadias , 1 was electively terminated , 1 resulted in the intrauterine death of twins , and 2 had unknown outcomes .
Animal Data During organogenesis , pregnant rats and rabbits received deferiprone at oral doses of 0 , 30 , 80 or 200 mg / kg / day , and 0 , 10 , 50 , or 150 mg / kg / day , respectively .
The daily dose was administered as two equal divided doses approximately 7 hours apart .
Doses of 200 mg / kg / day in rats and 150 mg / kg / day in rabbits , approximately 33 % and 49 % of the MRHD , respectively , resulted in increased post - implantation loss and reduced fetal weights in the presence of maternal toxicity ( reduced maternal body weight and body weight gain in both rats and rabbits ; abnormal large placenta at low incidence in rats ) .
The 200 mg / kg / day dose in rats resulted in external , visceral and skeletal fetal malformations such as cranial malformations , cleft palate , limb malrotation , anal atresia , internal hydrocephaly , anophthalmia and fused bones .
The dose of 150 mg / kg / day in rabbits resulted in external fetal malformations ( partially opened eyes ) and minor blood vessel and skeletal variations .
In rats , malformations including micrognathia and persistent ductus arteriosus could be observed in the absence of maternal toxicity at doses equal to or greater than 30 and 80 mg / kg / day , approximately 5 % and 13 % of the MHRD , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of deferiprone in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child , including the potential for tumorigenicity shown for deferiprone in animal studies , advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with FERRIPROX , and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating FERRIPROX .
Contraception Females FERRIPROX can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with FERRIPROX and for at least 6 months after the last dose .
Males Based on genotoxicity findings , advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with FERRIPROX and for at least 3 months after the last dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of FERRIPROX for the treatment of transfusional iron overload due to thalassemia syndromes have been established in pediatric patients 8 years of age and older .
Use of FERRIPROX for this indication is supported by evidence of efficacy from clinical trials in adult patients with thalassemia and evidence of safety in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease .
The safety and effectiveness of FERRIPROX for the treatment of transfusional iron overload due to sickle cell disease or other anemias have been established in 86 pediatric patients 3 to 16 years of age , among the 152 patients treated with FERRIPROX Tablets or Oral Solution in an adequate and well - controlled study [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The study included 56 patients 3 to < 12 years of age and 30 patients 12 to 16 years of age .
Seventy - six percent of these patients had sickle cell disease .
The recommended starting dose and dose - modifications are the same for children and adults [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) , Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Fourteen patients with spherocytosis ( including hereditary ) ( ages 3 - 15 ) , two patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency ( ages 4 and 6 ) , two patients with dyserythropoietic anemia ( ages 10 - 12 ) and two patients with hemolytic anemia ( ages 8 and 10 years old ) were treated with FERRIPROX in the clinical trial , LA38 - 0411 .
A US registry established from December 2011 through December 2019 , contains 125 patients from 4 to < 17 years old who have received FERRIPROX and have sickle cell disease .
The adverse reactions , including agranulocytosis , seen in the 8 year period of the registry are similar to those seen in the most recent clinical studies .
Safety and effectiveness of FERRIPROX Tablets have not been established in pediatric patients with chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions who are less than 8 years of age .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of deferiprone did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
10 OVERDOSAGE No cases of acute overdose have been reported .
There is no specific antidote to FERRIPROX overdose .
Neurological disorders such as cerebellar symptoms , diplopia , lateral nystagmus , psychomotor slowdown , hand movements and axial hypotonia have been observed in children treated with 2 . 5 to 3 times the recommended dose for more than one year .
The neurological disorders progressively regressed after deferiprone discontinuation .
11 DESCRIPTION FERRIPROX Tablets ( deferiprone ) contain 500 mg deferiprone ( 3 - hydroxy - 1 , 2 - dimethylpyridin - 4 - one ) , a synthetic , orally active , iron - chelating agent .
The molecular formula for deferiprone is C7H9NO2 and its molecular weight is 139 . 15 g / mol .
Deferiprone has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Deferiprone is a white to pinkish - white powder .
It is sparingly soluble in deionized water ( 14 . 3 mg / mL ) and has a melting point range of 272 ° C - 278 ° C . FERRIPROX Tablets are white to off - white , capsule - shaped tablets , and imprinted with “ APO ” score “ 500 ” on one side and plain on the other .
The tablets can be broken in half along the score line .
Each tablet contains 500 mg deferiprone and the following inactive ingredients : Tablet core - microcrystalline cellulose , magnesium stearate , colloidal silicon dioxide ; Coating - hypromellose , polyethylene glycol , titanium dioxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Deferiprone is a chelating agent with an affinity for ferric ions ( iron III ) .
Deferiprone binds with ferric ions to form neutral 3 : 1 ( deferiprone : iron ) complexes that are stable at physiological pH . 12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics No clinical studies were performed to assess the relationship between the dose of deferiprone and the amount of iron eliminated from the body .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At the maximum approved recommended dose , deferiprone does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The mean Cmax and AUC of deferiprone was 20 mcg / mL and 50 mcg ∙ h / mL , respectively , in healthy subjects .
The dose proportionality of deferiprone over the approved recommended dosage range is unknown .
Absorption Deferiprone appeared in the blood within 5 to 10 minutes after oral administration .
Peak serum concentration of deferiprone was reached approximately 1 to 2 hours after a single dose .
Effect of Food No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of deferiprone were observed following administration with food .
Elimination The elimination half - life of deferiprone is approximately 2 hours .
Metabolism Deferiprone is metabolized primarily by UGT1A6 .
The major metabolite of deferiprone is the 3 - O - glucuronide , which lacks iron binding capability .
Excretion Following oral administration , 75 % to 90 % of the administered dose was recovered in urine ( primarily as metabolite ) in the first 24 hours .
Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of deferiprone were observed based on sex , race / ethnicity , body weight , mild to severe ( eGFR 15 to 89 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) renal impairment , or mild ( Child Pugh Class A ) to moderate ( Child Pugh Class B ) hepatic impairment .
The effect of age , including geriatric or pediatric populations , end stage renal disease or severe ( Child Pugh Class C ) hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of deferiprone is unknown .
Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Studies UGTIA6 Inhibitors : Phenylbutazone ( UGT1A6 inhibitor ) decreased glucuronidation of deferiprone by up to 78 % .
Polyvalent Cations : Deferiprone has the potential to bind polyvalent cations ( e . g . , iron , aluminum , and zinc ) .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with deferiprone .
However , in view of the genotoxicity results , and the findings of mammary gland hyperplasia and mammary gland tumors in rats treated with deferiprone in the 52 - week toxicology study , tumor formation in carcinogenicity studies must be regarded as likely .
Deferiprone was positive in a mouse lymphoma cell assay in vitro .
Deferiprone was clastogenic in an in vitro chromosomal aberration test in mice and in a chromosomal aberration test in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells .
Deferiprone given orally or intraperitoneally was clastogenic in a bone marrow micronucleus assay in non - iron - loaded mice .
A micronucleus test was also positive when mice predosed with iron dextran were treated with deferiprone .
Deferiprone was not mutagenic in the Ames bacterial reverse mutation test .
A fertility and early embryonic development study of deferiprone was conducted in rats .
Sperm counts , motility and morphology were unaffected by treatment with deferiprone .
There were no effects observed on male or female fertility or reproductive function at the highest dose which was 25 % of the MRHD .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Transfusional Iron Overload in Patients with Thalassemia Syndromes In a prospective , planned , pooled analysis of patients with thalassemia syndromes from several studies , the efficacy of deferiprone was assessed in transfusion - dependent iron overload patients in whom previous iron chelation therapy had failed or was considered inadequate due to poor tolerance .
The main criterion for chelation failure was serum ferritin > 2 , 500 mcg / L before treatment with deferiprone .
Deferiprone therapy ( 35 - 99 mg / kg / day ) was considered successful in individual patients who experienced a ≥ 20 % decline in serum ferritin within one year of starting therapy .
Data from a total of 236 patients were analyzed .
Of the 224 patients with thalassemia who received deferiprone monotherapy and were eligible for serum ferritin analysis , 105 ( 47 % ) were male and 119 ( 53 % ) were female .
The mean age of these patients was 18 . 2 years ( range 2 to 62 ; 91 patients were < 17 ) .
For the patients in the analysis , the endpoint of at least a 20 % reduction in serum ferritin was met in 50 % ( of 236 subjects ) , with a 95 % confidence interval of 43 % to 57 % .
A small number of patients with thalassemia and iron overload were assessed by measuring the change in the number of milliseconds ( ms ) in the cardiac MRI T2 * value before and after treatment with deferiprone for one year .
There was an increase in cardiac MRI T2 * from a mean at baseline of 11 . 8 ± 4 . 9 ms to a mean of 15 . 1 ± 7 . 0 ms after approximately one year of treatment .
The clinical significance of this observation is not known .
14 . 2 Transfusional Iron Overload in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease and other Anemias Study LA38 - 0411 , an actively - controlled non - inferiority study compared the efficacy of FERRIPROX to that of deferoxamine in patients with sickle cell disease and other transfusion - dependent anemias by evaluating liver iron concentration ( LIC ) .
The efficacy of FERRIPROX was established based upon the change in LIC from baseline after 12 months of FERRIPROX ( 75 or 99 mg / kg / day ) compared to deferoxamine ( 20 or 40 mg / kg ( pediatric patients ) ; 40 or 50 mg / kg ( adult patients ) ) .
Patient enrollment was stopped following an interim analysis .
After adjusting for the type I ( alpha ) error , the non - inferiority criterion was established as the upper limit of the 96 . 01 % confidence interval for the difference between treatments being ≤ 2 mg / g dry weight ( dw ) .
Data from 185 patients ( 122 on FERRIPROX and 63 on deferoxamine ) were available .
Among the 122 FERRIPROX treated patients , the mean age was 15 . 9 years ( range 3 - 46 ) ; 57 . 4 % were male ; 75 . 4 % were White , 17 . 2 % were Black and 7 . 4 % were Multi - racial ; 85 % were diagnosed with Sickle Cell Disease and 15 % with other anemias .
Over 12 months , the Least Squares estimate of mean decrease from baseline in LIC was 4 . 13 ± 0 . 50 mg / g dw for FERRIPROX and 4 . 38 ± 0 . 59 mg / g dw for deferoxamine , and the non - inferiority criterion was met .
Upon completion of the first year of therapy in the non inferiority study , 89 patients from the ferriprox group opted to continue with treatment and 45 from the deferoxamine group opted to switch to ferriprox treatment .
This group continued for up to an additional 2 years .
LIC continued to decrease over time , with the mean value dropping from 14 . 93 mg / g dw at baseline to 12 . 30 mg / g dw after one year of treatment , to 11 . 19 mg / g dw after two years of treatment , and to 10 . 45 mg / g dw after three years of treatment .
