Bacillaceae ) .
It has a potency of not less than 6 , 000 polymyxin B units per mg , calculated on an anhydrous basis .
The structural formula is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Each mL contains : Actives : Trimethoprim Sulfate equivalent to Trimethoprim 1 mg ( 0 . 1 % ) and Polymyxin B Sulfate 10 , 000 units .
Preservative : Benzalkonium Chloride 0 . 04 mg ( 0 . 004 % ) .
Inactives : Sodium Chloride , Sulfuric Acid and Sodium Hydroxide may be added to adjust pH ( 3 . 0 to 5 . 5 ) , and Purified Water USP .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Trimethoprim is a synthetic antibacterial drug active against a wide variety of aerobic gram - positive and gram - negative ophthalmic pathogens .
Trimethoprim blocks the production of tetrahydrofolic acid from dihydrofolic acid by binding to and reversibly inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase .
This binding is very much stronger for the bacterial enzyme than for the corresponding mammalian enzyme .
For that reason , trimethoprim selectively interferes with bacterial biosynthesis of nucleic acids and proteins .
Polymyxin B , a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic , is rapidly bactericidal for a variety of gram - negative organisms , especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
It increases the permeability of the bacterial cell membrane by interacting with the phospholipid components of the membrane .
When used topically , trimethoprim and polymyxin B absorption through intact skin and mucous membranes is insignificant .
Blood samples were obtained from 11 human volunteers at 20 minutes , 1 hour and 3 hours following instillation in the eye of 2 drops of ophthalmic solution containing 1 mg trimethoprim and 10 , 000 units polymyxin B per mL .
Peak serum concentrations were approximately 0 . 03 mcg / mL trimethoprim and 1 unit / mL polymyxin B . Microbiology : In vitro studies have demonstrated that the anti - infective components of Trimethoprim and Polymyxin B Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution are active against the following bacterial pathogens that are capable of causing external infections of the eye : Trimethoprim : Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis , Streptococcus pyogenes , Streptococcus faecalis , Streptococcus pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , Haemophilus aegyptius , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Proteus mirabilis ( indole - negative ) , Proteus vulgaris ( indole - positive ) , Enterobacter aerogenes , and Serratia marcescens .
Polymyxin B : Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Enterobacter aerogenes and Haemophilus influenzae .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Trimethoprim Sulfate and Polymyxin B Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution is indicated in the treatment of surface ocular bacterial infections , including acute bacterial conjunctivitis , and blepharoconjunctivitis , caused by susceptible strains of the following microorganisms : Staphylococcus aureus , Staphylococcus epidermidis , Streptococcus pneumoniae , Streptococcus viridans , Haemophilus influenza and Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
* * Efficacy for this organism in this organ system was studied in fewer than 10 infections .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Trimethoprim Sulfate and Polymyxin B Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its components .
WARNINGS NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE .
If a sensitivity reaction to Trimethoprim and Polymyxin B Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution occurs , discontinue use .
Trimethoprim Sulfate and Polymyxin B Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution is not indicated for the prophylaxis or treatment of ophthalmic neonatorum .
PRECAUTIONS General : As with other antimicrobial preparations , prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms , including fungi .
If superinfection occurs , appropriate therapy should be initiated .
Information for Patients : Avoid contaminating the applicator tip with material from the eye , fingers , or other source .
This precaution is necessary if the sterility of the drops is to be maintained .
If redness , irritation , swelling or pain persists or increases , discontinue use immediately and contact your physician .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis : Long - term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted with polymyxin B sulfate or trimethoprim .
Mutagenesis : Trimethoprim was demonstrated to be non - mutagenic in the Ames assay .
In studies at two laboratories no chromosomal damage was detected in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells at concentrations approximately 500 times human plasma levels after oral administration ; at concentrations approximately 1000 times human plasma levels after oral administration in these same cells a low level of chromosomal damage was induced at one of the laboratories .
Studies to evaluate mutagenic potential have not been conducted with polymyxin B sulfate .
Impairment of Fertility : Polymyxin B sulfate has been reported to impair the motility of equine sperm , but its effects on male or female fertility are unknown .
No adverse effects on fertility or general reproductive performance were observed in rats given trimethoprim in oral dosages as high as 70 mg / kg / day for males and 14 mg / kg / day for females .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with polymyxin B sulfate .
It is not known whether polymyxin B sulfate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Trimethoprim has been shown to be teratogenic in the rat when given in oral doses 40 times the human dose .
In some rabbit studies , the overall increase in fetal loss ( dead and resorbed and malformed conceptuses ) was associated with oral doses 6 times the human therapeutic dose .
While there are no large well - controlled studies on the use of trimethoprim in pregnant women , Brumfitt and Pursell , in a retrospective study , reported the outcome of 186 pregnancies during which the mother received either placebo or oral trimethoprim in combination with sulfamethoxazole .
The incidence of congenital abnormalities was 4 . 5 % ( 3 of 66 ) in those who received placebo and 3 . 3 % ( 4 of 120 ) in those receiving trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole .
There were no abnormalities in the 10 children whose mothers received the drug during the first trimester .
In a separate survey , Brumfitt and Pursell also found no congenital abnormalities in 35 children whose mothers had received oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole at the time of conception or shortly thereafter .
Because trimethoprim may interfere with folic acid metabolism , trimethoprim should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Nonteratogenic Effects : The oral administration of trimethoprim to rats at a dose of 70 mg / kg / day commencing with the last third of gestation and continuing through parturition and lactation caused no deleterious effects on gestation or pup growth and survival .
Nursing mothers : It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when Trimethoprim Sulfate and Polymyxin B Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use : Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 2 months have not been established ( see WARNINGS ) .
ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequent adverse reaction to Trimethoprim Sulfate and Polymxin B Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution is local irritation consisting of increased redness , burning , stinging , and / or itching .
This may occur on instillation , within 48 hours , or at any time with extended use .
There are also multiple reports of hypersensitivity reactions consisting of lid edema , itching , increased redness , tearing , and / or circumocular rash .
Photosensitivity has been reported in patients taking oral trimethoprim .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adults : In mild to moderate infections , instill one drop in the affected eye ( s ) every three hours ( maximum of 6 doses per day ) for a period of 7 to 10 days .
Pediatric Use : Clinical studies have shown Trimethoprim and Polymyxin B Sulfate Ophthalmic Solution to be safe and effective for use in pediatric patients over two months of age .
The dosage regimen is the same as for adults .
