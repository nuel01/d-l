For Dermatologic Use Only - Not for Ophthalmic , Oral , or Intravaginal Use Rx only DESCRIPTION FINACEA ® ( azelaic acid ) Gel , 15 % , contains azelaic acid , a naturally occurring saturated dicarboxylic acid .
Chemically , azelaic acid is 1 , 7 - heptanedicarboxylic acid , with the molecular formula C9 H16 O4 , a molecular weight of 188 . 22 , and the structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Azelaic acid is a white , odorless crystalline solid that is poorly soluble in water at 20 ° C ( 0 . 24 % ) , but freely soluble in boiling water and in ethanol .
Each gram of FINACEA Gel , 15 % , contains 0 . 15 gm azelaic acid ( 15 % w / w ) as the active ingredient in an aqueous gel base containing benzoic acid ( as a preservative ) , disodium EDTA , lecithin , medium - chain triglycerides , polyacrylic acid , polysorbate 80 , propylene glycol , purified water , and sodium hydroxide to adjust pH . [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The mechanism ( s ) by which azelaic acid interferes with the pathogenic events in rosacea are unknown .
Pharmacokinetics : The percutaneous absorption of azelaic acid after topical application of FINACEA Gel , 15 % , could not be reliably determined .
Mean plasma azelaic acid concentrations in rosacea patients treated with FINACEA Gel , 15 % , twice daily for at least 8 weeks are in the range of 42 to 63 . 1 ng / mL .
These values are within the maximum concentration range of 24 . 0 to 90 . 5 ng / mL observed in rosacea patients treated with vehicle only .
This indicates that FINACEA Gel , 15 % , does not increase plasma azelaic acid concentration beyond the range derived from nutrition and endogenous metabolism .
In vitro and human data suggest negligible cutaneous metabolism of 3 H - azelaic acid 20 % cream after topical application .
Azelaic acid is mainly excreted unchanged in the urine , but undergoes some ß - oxidation to shorter chain dicarboxylic acids .
CLINICAL STUDIES FINACEA Gel , 15 % , was evaluated for the treatment of mild to moderate papulopustular rosacea in 2 clinical trials comprising a total of 664 ( 333 active to 331 vehicle ) patients .
Both trials were multicenter , randomized , double - blind , vehicle - controlled 12 - week studies with identical protocols .
Overall , 92 . 5 % of patients were Caucasian and 73 % of patients were women , and the mean age was 49 ( range 21 to 86 ) years .
Enrolled patients had mild to moderate rosacea with a mean lesion count of 18 ( range 8 to 60 ) inflammatory papules and pustules .
Subjects without papules and pustules , with nodules , rhinophyma , or ocular involvement , and a history of hypersensitivity to propylene glycol or to any other ingredients of the study drug were excluded .
FINACEA Gel , 15 % , or its vehicle were to be applied twice daily for 12 weeks ; no other topical or systemic medication affecting the course of rosacea and / or evaluability was to be used during the studies .
Patients were instructed to avoid spicy foods , thermally hot foods and drinks , and alcoholic beverages during the study , and to use only very mild soaps or soapless cleansing lotion for facial cleansing .
The primary efficacy endpoints were both • 1 .
change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts and • 2 .
success defined as a score of clear or minimal with at least a 2 step reduction from baseline on the Investigator ' s Global Assessment ( IGA ) : CLEAR : No papules and / or pustules ; no or residual erythema ; no or mild to moderate telangiectasia MINIMAL : Rare papules and / or pustules ; residual to mild erythema ; mild to moderate telangiectasia MILD : Few papules and / or pustules ; mild erythema ; mild to moderate telangiectasia MILD TO MODERATE : Distinct number of papules and / or pustules ; mild to moderate erythema ; mild to moderate telangiectasia MODERATE : Pronounced number of papules and / or pustules ; moderate erythema ; mild to moderate telangiectasia MODERATE TO SEVERE : Many papules and / or pustules , occasionally with large inflamed lesions ; moderate erythema ; moderate degree of telangiectasia SEVERE : Numerous papules and / or pustules , occasionally with confluent areas of inflamed lesions ; moderate or severe erythema ; moderate or severe telangiectasia Primary efficacy assessment was based on the intent - to - treat ( ITT ) population with last observation carried forward ( LOCF ) .
Both studies demonstrated a statistically significant difference in favor of FINACEA Gel , 15 % , over its vehicle in reducing the number of inflammatory papules and pustules associated with rosacea ( Table 1 ) and with success on the IGA in the ITT - LOCF population at the end of treatment .

Although some reduction of erythema which was present in patients with papules and pustules of rosacea occurred in clinical studies , efficacy for treatment of erythema in rosacea in the absence of papules and pustules has not been evaluated .
Patients should be instructed to avoid spicy foods , thermally hot foods and drinks , alcoholic beverages and to use only very mild soaps or soapless cleansing lotion for facial cleansing .
CONTRAINDICATIONS FINACEA Gel , 15 % , is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to propylene glycol or any other component of the formulation .
WARNINGS FINACEA Gel , 15 % , is for dermatologic use only , and not for ophthalmic , oral or intravaginal use .
There have been isolated reports of hypopigmentation after use of azelaic acid .
Since azelaic acid has not been well studied in patients with dark complexion , these patients should be monitored for early signs of hypopigmentation .
PRECAUTIONS General : Contact with the eyes should be avoided .
If sensitivity or severe irritation develops with the use of FINACEA Gel , 15 % , treatment should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted .
In a transgenic mouse study , chronic use of FINACEA Gel led to an increased number of animals with papillomas at the treatment site ( see PRECAUTIONS : Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , and Impairment of Fertility ) .
The clinical relevance of the findings in animal studies to humans is not clear .
Information for Patients Patients using FINACEA Gel , 15 % , should receive the following information and instructions : • • FINACEA Gel , 15 % , is to be used only as directed by the physician .
• • FINACEA Gel , 15 % , is for external use only .
It is not to be used orally , intravaginally , or for the eyes .
• • Cleanse affected area ( s ) with a very mild soap or a soapless cleansing lotion and pat dry with a soft towel before applying FINACEA Gel , 15 % .
Avoid alcoholic cleansers , tinctures and astringents , abrasives and peeling agents .
• • Avoid contact of FINACEA Gel , 15 % , with the mouth , eyes and other mucous membranes .
If it does come in contact with the eyes , wash the eyes with large amounts of water and consult a physician if eye irritation persists .
• • The hands should be washed following application of FINACEA Gel , 15 % .
• • Cosmetics may be applied after FINACEA Gel , 15 % , has dried .
• • Skin irritation ( e . g . , pruritus , burning , or stinging ) may occur during use of FINACEA Gel , 15 % , usually during the first few weeks of treatment .
If irritation is excessive or persists , use of FINACEA Gel , 15 % , should be discontinued , and patients should consult their physician ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
• • Avoid any foods and beverages that might provoke erythema , flushing , and blushing ( including spicy food , alcoholic beverages , and thermally hot drinks , including hot coffee and tea ) .
• • Patients should report abnormal changes in skin color to their physician .
• • Avoid the use of occlusive dressings or wrappings .
Drug Interactions : There have been no formal studies of the interaction of FINACEA Gel , 15 % , with other drugs .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Systemic long - term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of azelaic acid .
In a 26 - week dermal carcinogenicity study using transgenic ( Tg . AC ) mice , FINACEA Gel , 15 % , and the gel vehicle , when applied once or twice daily , did not increase the number of female Tg . AC animals with papillomas at the treatment site .
No statistically significant increase in the number of animals with papillomas at the treatment site was observed in male Tg . AC animals after once daily application .
After twice daily application , FINACEA Gel , 15 % , and the gel vehicle induced a statistically significant increase in the number of male animals with papillomas at the treatment site when compared to untreated males .
This suggests that the positive effect may be associated with the vehicle application .
The clinical relevance of the findings in animals to humans is not clear .
Azelaic acid was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in vitro ( Ames assay , HGPRT in V79 cells { Chinese hamster lung cells } , and chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes ) and in vivo ( dominant lethal assay in mice and mouse micronucleus assay ) genotoxicity tests .
Oral administration of azelaic acid at dose levels up to 2500 mg / kg / day ( 162 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area ) did not affect fertility or reproductive performance in male or female rats .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of topically administered azelaic acid in pregnant women .
The experience with FINACEA Gel , 15 % , when used by pregnant women is too limited to permit assessment of the safety of its use during pregnancy .
Dermal embryofetal developmental toxicology studies have not been performed with azelaic acid , 15 % , gel .
Oral embryofetal developmental studies were conducted with azelaic acid in rats , rabbits , and cynomolgus monkeys .
Azelaic acid was administered during the period of organogenesis in all three animal species .
Embryotoxicity was observed in rats , rabbits , and monkeys at oral doses of azelaic acid that generated some maternal toxicity .
Embryotoxicity was observed in rats given 2500 mg / kg / day ( 162 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area ) , rabbits given 150 or 500 mg / kg / day ( 19 or 65 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area ) and cynomolgus monkeys given 500 mg / kg / day ( 65 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area ) azelaic acid .
No teratogenic effects were observed in the oral embryofetal developmental studies conducted in rats , rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys .
An oral peri - and post - natal developmental study was conducted in rats .
Azelaic acid was administered from gestational day 15 through day 21 postpartum up to a dose level of 2500 mg / kg / day .
Embryotoxicity was observed in rats at an oral dose that generated some maternal toxicity ( 2500 mg / kg / day ; 162 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area ) .
In addition , slight disturbances in the postnatal development of fetuses was noted in rats at oral doses that generated some maternal toxicity ( 500 and 2500 mg / kg / day ; 32 and 162 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area ) .
No effects on sexual maturation of the fetuses were noted in this study .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used only if clearly needed during pregnancy .
Nursing Mothers : Equilibrium dialysis was used to assess human milk partitioning in vitro .
At an azelaic acid concentration of 25 μg / mL , the milk / plasma distribution coefficient was 0 . 7 and the milk / buffer distribution was 1 . 0 , indicating that passage of drug into maternal milk may occur .
Since less than 4 % of a topically applied dose of azelaic acid cream , 20 % , is systemically absorbed , the uptake of azelaic acid into maternal milk is not expected to cause a significant change from baseline azelaic acid levels in the milk .
However , caution should be exercised when FINACEA Gel , 15 % , is administered to a nursing mother .
Pediatric Use : Safety and effectiveness of FINACEA Gel , 15 % , in pediatric patients have not been established .
Geriatric Use : Clinical studies of FINACEA Gel , 15 % , did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Overall , treatment related adverse events , including burning , stinging / tingling , dryness / tightness / scaling , itching , and erythema / irritation / redness , were 19 . 4 % ( 24 / 124 ) for FINACEA Gel , 15 % , and 7 . 1 % ( 9 / 127 ) for the active comparator gel at 15 weeks .
In two vehicle controlled , and one active controlled U . S . clinical studies , treatment safety was monitored in 788 patients who used twice daily FINACEA Gel , 15 % , for 12 weeks ( N = 333 ) or for 15 weeks ( N = 124 ) , or the gel vehicle ( N = 331 ) for 12 weeks .

FINACEA Gel , 15 % , and its vehicle caused irritant reactions at the application site in human dermal safety studies .
FINACEA Gel , 15 % , caused significantly more irritation than its vehicle in a cumulative irritation study .
Some improvement in irritation was demonstrated over the course of the clinical studies , but this improvement might be attributed to subject dropouts .
No phototoxicity or photoallergenicity were reported in human dermal safety studies .
In patients using azelaic acid formulations , the following additional adverse experiences have been reported rarely : worsening of asthma , vitiligo depigmentation , small depigmented spots , hypertrichosis , reddening ( signs of keratosis pilaris ) , and exacerbation of recurrent herpes labialis .
Post - marketing safety - Skin : facial burning and irritation ; Eyes : iridocyclitis on accidental exposure with FINACEA Gel , 15 % , to the eye ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
OVERDOSAGE FINACEA Gel , 15 % , is intended for cutaneous use only .
If pronounced local irritation occurs , patients should be directed to discontinue use and appropriate therapy should be instituted ( See PRECAUTIONS ) .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION A thin layer of FINACEA Gel , 15 % , should be gently massaged into the affected areas on the face twice daily , in the morning and evening .
Patients should be reassessed if no improvement is observed upon completing 12 weeks of therapy .
