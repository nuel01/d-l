( 8 . 7 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies , CRESEMBA may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no available human data on the use of CRESEMBA in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , perinatal mortality was increased in the offspring of pregnant rats dosed orally with isavuconazonium sulfate at approximately 0 . 5 times the clinical exposure during pregnancy through the weaning period .
In animal studies when isavuconazonium chloride was administered by oral gavage to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at exposures corresponding to less than the human maintenance dose , increases in the incidences of multiple skeletal abnormalities , including rudimentary cervical ribs and fused zygomatic arches , were observed ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Isavuconazonium chloride administration during organogenesis ( gestational days 6 - 17 in rats and gestational days 6 - 18 in rabbits ) was associated with dose - related increases in the incidences of rudimentary cervical ribs in rats and rabbits at 30 and 45 mg / kg , respectively , equivalent to about 0 . 2 and 0 . 1 times of the clinical exposure based on AUC comparisons .
In rats , dose - related increases in the incidences of zygomatic arch fusion and supernumerary ribs / rudimentary supernumerary ribs were also noted at 30 mg / kg and above , equivalent to 0 . 2 times the human AUC .
Skeletal abnormalities have also been observed in embryo - fetal development studies of other azole antifungal agents .
Isavuconazonium sulfate increased perinatal mortality in the pups when orally administered to pregnant rats during pregnancy and lactation ( gestational day 6 through postpartum day 20 ) at doses up to 90 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 5 times the clinical exposure based on AUC comparison ) .
No effect on the duration of pregnancy or delivery was seen in the pups at this same dose .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of isavuconazole in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production .
Isavuconazole was present in the milk of lactating rats following intravenous administration .
When a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
Therefore , breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment with CRESEMBA .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception CRESEMBA may cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with CRESEMBA and for 28 days after the final dose .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of CRESEMBA in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 547 patients who received CRESEMBA in the Phase 2 and 3 trials , 86 ( 16 % ) of patients were greater than 65 years of age and 20 ( 4 % ) were greater than 75 years of age .
The pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole are comparable in young and elderly subjects ( 65 years of age and older ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No dose adjustment of CRESEMBA is needed in elderly patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Of the 403 patients who received CRESEMBA in the Phase 3 trials , 79 ( 20 % ) of patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) less than 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 .
No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild , moderate , or severe renal impairment , including those patients with End - Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A and B ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
CRESEMBA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) and should be used in these patients only when the benefits outweigh the risks .
Clinical monitoring for CRESEMBA - related adverse reactions is recommended when treating patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE During clinical studies , total daily CRESEMBA doses higher than the recommended dose regimen were associated with an increased rate of adverse reactions .
At supratherapeutic doses ( three times the recommended maintenance dose ) evaluated in a thorough QT study , there were proportionally more treatment - emergent adverse reactions than in the therapeutic dose group ( maintenance dose ) for the following : headache , dizziness , paresthesia , somnolence , disturbance in attention , dysgeusia , dry mouth , diarrhea , oral hypoesthesia , vomiting , hot flush , anxiety , restlessness , palpitations , tachycardia , photophobia and arthralgia .
Treatment - emergent adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of study drug occurred in 7 of 39 ( 17 . 9 % ) subjects in the supratherapeutic dose group .
Isavuconazole is not removed by hemodialysis .
There is no specific antidote for isavuconazole .
Treatment should be supportive with appropriate monitoring .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Isavuconazonium sulfate is the prodrug of isavuconazole , an azole antifungal [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetic / Pharmacodynamic Relationship In patients treated with CRESEMBA for invasive aspergillosis in a controlled trial , there was no significant association between plasma AUC or plasma isavuconazole concentration and efficacy .
Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect on QTc interval of multiple doses of CRESEMBA capsules was evaluated .
CRESEMBA was administered as 2 capsules ( equivalent to 200 mg isavuconazole ) three times daily on days 1 and 2 followed by either 2 capsules or 6 capsules ( equivalent to 600 mg isavuconazole ) once daily for 13 days in a randomized , placebo - and active - controlled ( moxifloxacin 400 mg single - dose ) , four - treatment - arm , parallel study in 160 healthy subjects .
Isavuconazole resulted in dose - related shortening of the QTc interval .
For the 2 - capsule dosing regimen , the least squares mean ( LSM ) difference from placebo was - 13 . 1 msec at 2 hours postdose [ 90 % CI : - 17 . 1 , - 9 . 1 msec ] .
Increasing the dose to 6 capsules resulted in an LSM difference from placebo of - 24 . 6 msec at 2 hours postdose [ 90 % CI : - 28 . 7 , - 20 . 4 ] .
CRESEMBA was not evaluated in combination with other drugs that reduce the QTc interval , so the additive effects are not known .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics General Pharmacokinetics In healthy subjects , the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole following oral administration of CRESEMBA capsules at isavuconazole equivalent doses up to 600 mg per day ( 6 capsules ) are dose proportional ( Table 5 ) .
Based on a population pharmacokinetics analysis of healthy subjects and patients , the mean plasma half - life of isavuconazole was 130 hours and the mean volume of distribution ( Vss ) was approximately 450 L following intravenous administration .
Table 5 .

Following oral administration of CRESEMBA capsules at an isavuconazole equivalent dose of 200 mg in 66 fasted healthy male subjects , a single dose administration of two 186 mg CRESEMBA capsules and five 74 . 5 mg CRESEMBA capsules exhibited a mean ( SD ) Cmax and AUC of 3296 ( 614 ) ng / mL and 112229 ( 30289 ) ng · hr / mL , respectively , and 3277 ( 576 ) ng / mL and 117913 ( 33142 ) ng · hr / mL , respectively .
Absorption After oral administration of CRESEMBA in healthy volunteers , the active moiety , isavuconazole , generally reaches maximum plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) 2 hours to 3 hours after single and multiple dosing .
The absolute bioavailability of isavuconazole following oral administration of CRESEMBA is 98 % .
No significant concentrations of the prodrug or inactive cleavage product were seen in plasma after oral administration .
Following intravenous administration of CRESEMBA , maximal plasma concentrations of the prodrug and inactive cleavage product were detectable during infusion and declined rapidly following the end of administration .
The prodrug was below the level of detection by 1 . 25 hours after the start of a one - hour infusion .
The total exposure of the prodrug based on AUC was less than 1 % that of isavuconazole .
The inactive cleavage product was quantifiable in some subjects up to 8 hours after the start of infusion .
The total exposure of inactive cleavage product based on AUC was approximately 1 . 3 % that of isavuconazole .
CRESEMBA given orally as an intravenous solution administered via nasogastric ( NG ) tube provides systemic isavuconazole exposure that is similar to the oral capsule ( Table 6 ) .

CRESEMBA can be taken with or without food .
Distribution Isavuconazole is extensively distributed with a mean steady state volume of distribution ( Vss ) of approximately 450 L . Isavuconazole is highly protein bound ( greater than 99 % ) , predominantly to albumin .
Metabolism In in vitro studies isavuconazonium sulfate is rapidly hydrolyzed in blood to isavuconazole by esterases , predominantly by butylcholinesterase .
Isavuconazole is a substrate of cytochrome P450 enzymes 3A4 and 3A5 .
Following single doses of [ cyano 14 C ] isavuconazonium and [ pyridinylmethyl 14 C ] isavuconazonium in humans , in addition to the active moiety ( isavuconazole ) and the inactive cleavage product , a number of minor metabolites were identified .
Except for the active moiety isavuconazole , no individual metabolite was observed with an AUC greater than 10 % of drug - related material .
In vivo studies indicate that CYP3A4 , CYP3A5 and subsequently uridine diphosphate - glucuronosyltransferases ( UGT ) are involved in the metabolism of isavuconazole .
Excretion Following oral administration of radio - labeled isavuconazonium sulfate to healthy volunteers , a mean of 46 . 1 % of the total radioactive dose was recovered in the feces and 45 . 5 % was recovered in the urine .
Renal excretion of isavuconazole itself was less than 1 % of the dose administered .
The inactive cleavage product is primarily eliminated by metabolism and subsequent renal excretion of the metabolites .
Renal elimination of intact cleavage product was less than 1 % of the total dose administered .
Following intravenous administration of radio - labeled cleavage product , 95 % of the total radioactive dose was excreted in the urine .
Special populations Geriatric Patients The AUC of isavuconazole following a single oral dose of CRESEMBA equivalent to 200 mg isavuconazole in elderly subjects ( 65 years and older ) was similar to that in younger volunteers ( 18 years to 45 years ) .
The AUC was similar between younger female and male subjects and between elderly and younger males .
Elderly female AUC estimates were 38 % and 47 % greater than AUC estimates obtained in elderly males and younger females , respectively .
The pharmacokinetic difference in elderly females receiving CRESEMBA are not considered to be clinically significant .
Therefore , no dose adjustment is required based on age and gender .
Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of CRESEMBA in pediatric patients have not been evaluated .
Race A 2 - compartment population pharmacokinetic model was developed to assess the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole between healthy Western and Chinese subjects .
Chinese subjects were found to have on average a 40 % lower clearance compared to Western subjects ( 1 . 6 L / hr for Chinese subjects as compared to 2 . 6 L / hr for Western subjects ) and therefore approximately 50 % higher AUC than Western subjects .
Body mass index ( BMI ) did not play a role in the observed differences .
No dose adjustment is recommended for Chinese patients .
Gender AUC estimates were similar between young female and male subjects ( 18 years to 45 years ) .
There was a difference in AUC for elderly females , see Geriatric section above .
No dose adjustment is required based on gender .
Renal Impairment Total isavuconazole AUC and Cmax were not affected to a clinically meaningful extent in subjects with mild , moderate and severe renal impairment relative to healthy controls .
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment .
Isavuconazole is not readily dialyzable .
A dose adjustment is not warranted in patients with ESRD .
Hepatic Impairment After a single - dose of CRESEMBA equivalent to 100 mg of isavuconazole was administered to 32 patients with mild ( Child - Pugh Class A ) hepatic impairment and 32 patients with moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B ) hepatic impairment ( 16 intravenous and 16 oral patients per Child - Pugh Class ) , the least squares mean systemic exposure ( AUC ) increased 64 % and 84 % in the Child - Pugh Class A group and the Child - Pugh Class B group , respectively , relative to 32 age and weight - matched healthy subjects with normal hepatic function .
Mean Cmax was 2 % lower in the Child - Pugh Class A group and 30 % lower in the Child - Pugh Class B group .
The population pharmacokinetic evaluation of isavuconazole in healthy subjects and patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment demonstrated that the mild and moderate hepatic impairment population had 40 % and 48 % lower isavuconazole clearance ( CL ) values , respectively , compared to the healthy population .
It is recommended that the standard CRESEMBA loading dose and maintenance dose regimen be utilized in patients with mild to moderate hepatic disease .
CRESEMBA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) .
Drug Interaction Studies Isavuconazole is a substrate of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 .
In vitro , isavuconazole is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , and CYP2D6 .
Isavuconazole is also an inhibitor of P - gp - , BCRP - and OCT2 - mediated drug transporters .
In vitro , isavuconazole is also an inducer of CYP3A4 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , and CYP2C9 .
The effect of coadministration of drugs on the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole and the effect of isavuconazole on the pharmacokinetics of coadministered drugs were studied after single and multiple doses of isavuconazole in healthy subjects .
The effects of ketoconazole , rifampin , lopinavir / ritonavir , and esomeprazole on isavuconazole are shown in Figure 1 .
Ketoconazole : As a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor , ketoconazole increased the isavuconazole Cmax by 9 % and isavuconazole AUC by 422 % after multiple - dose administration of ketoconazole ( 200 mg twice daily ) for 24 days and a single - dose of CRESEMBA equivalent to 200 mg of isavuconazole .
Isavuconazole is a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate and use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are contraindicated per Section 4 and Figure 1 .
Lopinavir / Ritonavir : Lopinavir / ritonavir ( 400 mg / 100 mg twice daily ) increased the Cmax and AUC of isavuconazole by 74 % and 96 % , respectively , with concurrent decreases in the mean AUCs of lopinavir and ritonavir by 27 % and 31 % , respectively .
Rifampin : Rifampin ( 600 mg ) decreased the mean Cmax and AUC of isavuconazole by 75 % and 97 % , respectively , when coadministered with multiple doses of CRESEMBA and thus , coadministration of CRESEMBA with strong CYP3A4 inducers is contraindicated .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] The effects of isavuconazole on ritonavir , lopinavir , prednisone , combined oral contraceptives ( ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone ) , cyclosporine , atorvastatin , sirolimus , midazolam , and tacrolimus are shown in Figure 2 .
CYP3A4 Substrates : CRESEMBA increased the systemic exposure of sensitive CYP3A4 substrates midazolam , sirolimus and tacrolimus approximately 2 - fold , and therefore CRESEMBA is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] The effects of isavuconazole on other CYP substrates : caffeine , bupropion , methadone , repaglinide , warfarin , omeprazole , and dextromethorphan , are shown in Figure 3 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] The effects of isavuconazole on the substrates of UGT and transporters : mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , methotrexate , metformin , and digoxin are shown in Figure 4 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Isavuconazonium sulfate is the prodrug of isavuconazole , an azole antifungal drug .
Isavuconazole inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol , a key component of the fungal cell membrane , through the inhibition of cytochrome P - 450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14 - alpha - demethylase .
This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol .
An accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the fungal cell membrane weakens the membrane structure and function .
Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to isavuconazole inhibition .
Resistance There is a potential for development of resistance to isavuconazole .
The mechanism of resistance to isavuconazole , like other azole antifungals , is likely due to multiple mechanisms that include substitutions in the target gene CYP51 .
Changes in sterol profile and elevated efflux pump activity were observed ; however , the clinical relevance of these findings is unclear .
In vitro and animal studies suggest cross - resistance between isavuconazole and other azoles .
The relevance of cross - resistance to clinical outcome has not been fully characterized ; however , patients failing prior azole therapy may require alternative antifungal therapy .
Antimicrobial Activity Isavuconazole has activity against most strains of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections : Aspergillus flavus , Aspergillus fumigatus , Aspergillus niger , and Mucorales such as Rhizopus oryzae and Mucormycetes species [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In a 2 - year rat carcinogenicity study and a 2 - year mouse carcinogenicity study , dose - related increases in hepatocellular adenomas and / or carcinomas were observed in male and female B6C3F1 / Crl mice , and male , but not female Han Wistar rats at doses as low as 0 . 1 times the exposure seen in humans administered the maintenance dose .
Hepatic hemangiomas were increased in female mice at 300 mg / kg , at an exposure similar to the maintenance dose .
Hepatoblastoma were increased in male mice at 100 mg / kg , about 0 . 4 times the systemic exposures based on AUC comparisons .
Thyroid follicular cell adenomas were observed in male and female rats at doses as low as 60 mg / kg in male rats ( about 0 . 2 times the human clinical maintenance dose ) .
The relevance of the rat thyroid tumors to human carcinogenic risk remains unclear .
A significant increase in the incidence of skin fibromas was seen in male rats at 300 mg / kg , exposures 0 . 8 times the human exposure at the human clinical maintenance dose .
Uterine adenocarcinomas were observed in female rats at 200 mg / kg , at systemic exposures similar to the human exposure at the human clinical maintenance dose .
No mutagenic or clastogenic effects were detected in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay and the in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats .
Oral administration of isavuconazonium sulfate did not affect the fertility in male or female rats treated at doses up to 90 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 3 times the systemic exposure at the human clinical maintenance dose ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Treatment of Invasive Aspergillosis Trial 1 was a randomized , double - blind , non - inferiority active controlled trial which evaluated the safety and efficacy of CRESEMBA versus voriconazole for primary treatment of invasive fungal disease caused by Aspergillus species or other filamentous fungi .
Eligible patients had proven , probable , or possible invasive fungal infections per European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer / Mycoses Study Group ( EORTC / MSG ) criteria1 .
Patients were stratified by history of allogeneic bone marrow transplant , uncontrolled malignancy at baseline , and by geographic region .
The mean age of patients was 51 years ( range 17 - 87 ) and the majority were Caucasians ( 78 % ) , male ( 60 % ) , with fungal disease involving the lungs ( 95 % ) .
At least one Aspergillus species was identified in 30 % of the subjects ; A . fumigatus and A . flavus were the most common pathogens identified .
There were few patients with other Aspergillus species : A . niger , A . sydowii , A . terreus , and A . westerdijkiae .
Baseline risk factors are presented in Table 7 .

[ 2 ] Neutropenia defined as less than 500 cells / mm3 .
Patients randomized to receive CRESEMBA treatment were administered a loading dose intravenously of 372 mg of isavuconazonium sulfate ( equivalent to 200 mg of isavuconazole ) every 8 hours for the first 48 hours .
Beginning on Day 3 , patients received intravenous or oral therapy of 372 mg of isavuconazonium sulfate ( equivalent to 200 mg of isavuconazole ) once daily .
Patients randomized to receive voriconazole treatment were administered voriconazole intravenously with a loading dose of 6 mg / kg every 12 hours for the first 24 hours followed by 4 mg / kg intravenously every 12 hours for the following 24 hours .
Therapy could then be switched to an oral formulation of voriconazole at a dose of 200 mg every 12 hours .
In this trial , the protocol - defined maximum treatment duration was 84 days .
Mean treatment duration was 47 days for both treatment groups , of which 8 to 9 days was by an intravenous route of administration .
All - cause mortality through Day 42 in the overall population ( ITT ) was 18 . 6 % in the CRESEMBA treatment group and 20 . 2 % in the voriconazole treatment group for an adjusted treatment difference of - 1 . 0 % with 95 % confidence interval of - 8 . 0 % to 5 . 9 % .
Similar results were seen in patients with proven or probable invasive aspergillosis confirmed by serology , culture or histology ( see Table 8 ) .

14 . 2 Treatment of Invasive Mucormycosis Trial 2 , an open - label , non - comparative trial , evaluated the safety and efficacy of a subset of patients with invasive mucormycosis .
Thirty - seven ( 37 ) patients had proven or probable mucormycosis according to criteria based on those established by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer / Mycoses Study Group1 .
Rhizopus oryzae and Mucormycetes were the most common pathogens identified .
There were few patients with other Mucorales : Lichtheimia corymbifera , Mucor amphibiorum , Mucor circinelloides , Rhizomucor pusillus , Rhizopus azygosporus , and Rhizopus microsporus .
The patients were white ( 68 % ) , male ( 81 % ) , and had a mean age of 49 years ( range 22 - 79 ) .
Fifty - nine percent ( 59 % ) of patients had pulmonary disease involvement , half of whom also had other organ involvement .
The most common non - pulmonary disease locations were sinus ( 43 % ) , eye ( 19 % ) , CNS ( 16 % ) and bone ( 14 % ) .
Baseline risk factors are presented in Table 10 .
The Independent Data Review Committee classified patients receiving CRESEMBA as primary therapy , or for invasive mold disease refractory to , or patients intolerant of other antifungal therapy .

Patients were treated with CRESEMBA intravenously or via oral administration at the recommended doses .
Median treatment duration was 102 days for patients classified as primary , 33 days for refractory , and 85 days for intolerant [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
For patients with invasive mucormycosis , all - cause mortality through Day 42 and success in overall response at the End - of - Treatment as assessed by the Independent Data Review Committee is shown in Table 11 .
These results provide evidence that CRESEMBA is effective for the treatment of mucormycosis , in light of the natural history of untreated mucormycosis .
However , the efficacy of CRESEMBA for the treatment of invasive mucormycosis has not been evaluated in concurrent , controlled clinical trials .
