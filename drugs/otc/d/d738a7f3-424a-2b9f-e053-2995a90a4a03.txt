( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Lactic Acidosis : See boxed warning .
( 5 . 1 ) • Vitamin B12 Deficiency : Metformin may lower vitamin B12 levels .
Measure hematological parameters annually and vitamin B12 at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities .
( 5 . 2 ) • Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues : Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and / or an insulin secretagogue .
Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required ( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Lactic Acidosis There have been postmarketing cases of metformin - associated lactic acidosis , including fatal cases .
These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise , myalgias , abdominal pain , respiratory distress , or increased somnolence ; however , hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis .
Metformin - associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations ( > 5 mmol / L ) , anion gap acidosis ( without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia ) , and an increased lactate : pyruvate ratio ; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg / mL .
Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis , especially in patients at risk .
If metformin - associated lactic acidosis is suspected , general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting , along with immediate discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
In metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis , prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin ( metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL / min under good hemodynamic conditions ) .
Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery .
Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and , if these symptoms occur , instruct them to discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets and report these symptoms to their healthcare provider .
For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin - associated lactic acidosis , recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin - associated lactic acidosis are provided below : • Renal impairment - The postmarketing metformin - associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment .
The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin - associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney .
Clinical recommendations based upon the patient ' s renal function include [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] : • Before initiating metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets , obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) .
• Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets are contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
• Initiation of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets are not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 to 45 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 .
• Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
In patients at risk for the development of renal impairment ( e . g . , the elderly ) , renal function should be assessed more frequently .
• In patients taking metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets whose eGFR falls below 45 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 , assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy .
• Drug interactions - The concomitant use of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin - associated lactic acidosis : those that impair renal function , result in significant hemodynamic change , interfere with acid - base balance , or increase metformin accumulation .
Consider more frequent monitoring of patients .
• Age 65 or greater - The risk of metformin - associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient ' s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic , renal , or cardiac impairment than younger patients .
Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients .
• Radiologic studies with contrast - Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin - treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis .
Stop metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets at the time of , or prior to , an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment , alcoholism or heart failure ; or in patients who will be administered intra - arterial iodinated contrast .
Re - evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure , and restart metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets if renal function is stable .
• Surgery and other procedures - Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion , hypotension , and renal impairment .
Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake .
• Hypoxic states - Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin - associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure ( particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia ) .
Cardiovascular collapse ( shock ) , acute myocardial infarction , sepsis , and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may cause prerenal azotemia .
When such an event occurs , discontinue metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
• Excessive alcohol intake - Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism .
Patients should be warned against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
• Hepatic impairment - Patients with hepatic impairment have developed cases of metformin - associated lactic acidosis .
This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels .
Therefore , avoid use of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease .
5 . 2 Vitamin B12 Deficiency In metformin hydrochloride tablets clinical trials of 29 - week duration , a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7 % of patients .
Such decrease , possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 - intrinsic factor complex , may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride tablets or vitamin B 12 supplementation .
Certain individuals ( those with inadequate vitamin B 12 or calcium intake or absorption ) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B 12 levels .
Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B 12 at 2 to 3 year intervals in patients on metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets and manage any abnormalities [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 3 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin and Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues ( e . g . , sulfonylurea ) are known to cause hypoglycemia .
Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and / or an insulin secretagogue .
Therefore , a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
5 . 4 Macrovascular Outcomes There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS id = " ID45 " > The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling : • Lactic Acidosis [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Vitamin B 12 Deficiency [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
• Hypoglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
For metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets , the most common adverse reactions ( > 5 . 0 % ) are diarrhea , nausea / vomiting , flatulence , asthenia , indigestion , abdominal discomfort , and headache .

6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - Release Tablets : In placebo - controlled trials , 781 patients were administered metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
Adverse reactions reported in greater than 5 % of the metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets patients , and that were more common in metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets - than placebo - treated patients , are listed in Table 2 .
Table 2 : Adverse Reactions from Clinical Trials of Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - Release Tablets Occurring > 5 % and More Common than Placebo in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - Release Tablets ( n = 781 ) Placebo ( n = 195 ) Diarrhea 10 % 3 % Nausea / Vomiting 7 % 2 % Diarrhea led to discontinuation of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets in 0 . 6 % of patients .
Additionally , the following adverse reactions were reported in ≥ 1 . 0 % to ≤ 5 . 0 % of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets patients and were more commonly reported with metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets than placebo : abdominal pain , constipation , distention abdomen , dyspepsia / heartburn , flatulence , dizziness , headache , upper respiratory infection , taste disturbance .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of metformin .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Cholestatic , hepatocellular , and mixed hepatocellular liver injury have been reported with postmarketing use of metformin .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 3 presents clinically significant drug interactions with metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
Table 3 : Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Clinical Impact : Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors frequently cause a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non - anion gap , hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis .
Concomitant use of these drugs with metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets may increase the risk for lactic acidosis .
Intervention : Consider more frequent monitoring of these patients .
Examples : Topiramate , zonisamide , acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide .
Drugs that Reduce Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - Release Tablets Clearance Clinical Impact : Concomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of metformin ( e . g . , organic cationic transporter - 2 [ OCT2 ] / multidrug and toxin extrusion [ MATE ] inhibitors ) could increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention : Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use with metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
Examples : Ranolazine , vandetanib , dolutegravir , and cimetidine .
Alcohol Clinical Impact : Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism .
Intervention : Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin Clinical Impact : Coadministration of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets with an insulin secretagogue ( e . g . , sulfonylurea ) or insulin may increase the risk of hypoglycemia .
Intervention : Patients receiving an insulin secretagogue or insulin may require lower doses of the insulin secretagogue or insulin .
Drugs Affecting Glycemic Control Clinical Impact : Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control .
Intervention : When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets , observe the patient closely for loss of blood glucose control .
When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets , observe the patient closely for hypoglycemia .
Examples : Thiazides and other diuretics , corticosteroids , phenothiazines , thyroid products , estrogens , oral contraceptives , phenytoin , nicotinic acid , sympathomimetics , calcium channel blockers , and isoniazid .
• Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may increase risk of lactic acidosis .
Consider more frequent monitoring ( 7 ) • Drugs that reduce metformin clearance ( such as ranolazine , vandetanib , dolutegravir , and cimetidine ) may increase the accumulation of metformin .
Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use ( 7 ) • Alcohol can potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism .
Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake ( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : Advise premenopausal females of the potential for an unintended pregnancy .
( 8 . 3 ) • Geriatric Use : Assess renal function more frequently .
( 8 . 5 ) • Hepatic Impairment : Avoid use in patients with hepatic impairment .
( 8 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug - associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage .
Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk [ see Data ] .
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
No adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 2 - and 5 times , respectively , a 2550 mg clinical dose , based on body surface area [ see Data ] .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 to 10 % in women with pre - gestational diabetes mellitus with an HbA1C > 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 to 25 % in women with a HbA1C > 10 .
The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk Poorly - controlled diabetes mellitus in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis , pre - eclampsia , spontaneous abortions , preterm delivery , stillbirth and delivery complications .
Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus increases the fetal risk for major birth defects , stillbirth , and macrosomia related morbidity .
Data Human Data Published data from post - marketing studies have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin was used during pregnancy .
However , these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any metformin - associated risk because of methodological limitations , including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups .
Animal Data Metformin hydrochloride did not adversely affect development outcomes when administered to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg / kg / day .
This represents an exposure of about 2 and 5 times a 2550 mg clinical dose based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits , respectively .
Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk [ see Data ] .
However , there is insufficient information to determine the effects of metformin on the breastfed infant and no available information on the effects of metformin on milk production .
Therefore , the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition .
Data Published clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk which resulted in infant doses approximately 0 . 11 % to 1 % of the maternal weight - adjusted dosage and a milk / plasma ratio ranging between 0 . 13 and 1 .
However , the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as therapy with metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets may result in ovulation in some anovulatory women .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - Release Tablets : Safety and effectiveness of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Controlled clinical studies of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis .
Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment .
Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets are contraindicated in severe renal impairment , patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) below 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Use of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis .
Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets are not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment .
[ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdose of metformin hydrochloride has occurred , including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams .
Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10 % of cases , but no causal association with metformin has been established .
Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32 % of metformin overdose cases [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL / min under good hemodynamic conditions .
Therefore , hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected .
11 DESCRIPTION Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets , USP contain the antihyperglycemic agent metformin , which is a biguanide , in the form of monohydrochloride .
The chemical name of metformin hydrochloride is N , N - dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide hydrochloride .
The structural formula is as shown below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Metformin hydrochloride is a white to off - white crystalline compound with a molecular formula of C 4 H 11 N 5 • HCl and a molecular weight of 165 . 63 .
It is freely soluble in water and is practically insoluble in acetone , ether , and chloroform .
The pK a of metformin is 12 . 4 .
The pH of a 1 % aqueous solution of metformin hydrochloride is 6 . 68 .
Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets , USP contains 500 mg of metformin hydrochloride , which is equivalent to 389 . 93 mg metformin base .
Metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets USP , 500 mg contain the inactive ingredients carboxymethylcellulose sodium , hypromellose and magnesium stearate .
Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - Release Tablets , USP meets USP Dissolution Test 3 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus , lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose .
Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production , decreases intestinal absorption of glucose , and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization .
With metformin therapy , insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day - long plasma insulin response may decrease .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics id = " ID87 " > Absorption Following a single oral dose of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets , C max is achieved with a median value of 7 hours and a range of 4 to 8 hours .
Peak plasma levels are approximately 20 % lower compared to the same dose of metformin hydrochloride tablets , however , the extent of absorption ( as measured by AUC ) is comparable to metformin hydrochloride tablets .
At steady state , the AUC and C max are less than dose proportional for metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets within the range of 500 to 2000 mg administered once daily .
Peak plasma levels are approximately 0 . 6 , 1 . 1 , 1 . 4 and 1 . 8 mcg / mL for 500 , 1000 , 1500 , and 2000 mg once - daily doses , respectively .
The extent of metformin absorption ( as measured by AUC ) from metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets at a 2000 mg once - daily dose is similar to the same total daily dose administered as metformin hydrochloride tablets 1000 mg twice daily .
After repeated administration of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets , metformin did not accumulate in plasma .
Effect of food : Although the extent of metformin absorption ( as measured by AUC ) from the metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets increased by approximately 50 % when given with food , there was no effect of food on C max and T max of metformin .
Both high and low fat meals had the same effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets ..
Distribution The apparent volume of distribution ( V / F ) of metformin following single oral doses of metformin hydrochloride tablets 850 mg averaged 654 ± 358 L . Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins .
Metformin partitions into erythrocytes , most likely as a function of time .
Metabolism Intravenous single - dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism ( no metabolites have been identified in humans ) nor biliary excretion .
Elimination Renal clearance ( see Table 4 ) is approximately 3 . 5 times greater than creatinine clearance , which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination .
Following oral administration , approximately 90 % of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours , with a plasma elimination half - life of approximately 6 . 2 hours .
In blood , the elimination half - life is approximately 17 . 6 hours , suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution .
Specific Populations Renal Impairment In patients with decreased renal function the plasma and blood half - life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased ( see Table 3 ) [ See Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Hepatic Impairment No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Geriatrics Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin hydrochloride tablets in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased , the half - life is prolonged , and C max is increased , compared to healthy young subjects .
It appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function ( see Table 4 ) .
[ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats ( dosing duration of 104 weeks ) and mice ( dosing duration of 91 weeks ) at doses up to and including 900 mg / kg / day and 1500 mg / kg / day , respectively .
These doses are both approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2550 mg based on body surface area comparisons .
No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice .
Similarly , there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats .
There was , however , an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg / kg / day .
There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests : Ames test ( S . typhimurium ) , gene mutation test ( mouse lymphoma cells ) , or chromosomal aberrations test ( human lymphocytes ) .
Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative .
Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg / kg / day , which is approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2550 mg based on body surface area comparisons .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 2 Metformin Hydrochloride Extended - Release Tablets id = " ID97 " > A 24 - week , double - blind , placebo - controlled study of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets , taken once daily with the evening meal , was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had failed to achieve glycemic control with diet and exercise .
Patients entering the study had a mean baseline HbA 1 c of 8 . 0 % and a mean baseline FPG of 176 mg / dL .
The treatment dose was increased to 1500 mg once daily if at Week 12 HbA 1 c was ≥ 7 . 0 % but < 8 . 0 % ( patients with HbA 1 c ≥ 8 . 0 % were discontinued from the study ) .
At the final visit ( 24 - week ) , mean HbA 1 c had increased 0 . 2 % from baseline in placebo patients and decreased 0 . 6 % with metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets .
A 16 - week , double - blind , placebo - controlled , dose - response study of metformin hydrochloride extended - release tablets , taken once daily with the evening meal or twice daily with meals , was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had failed to achieve glycemic control with diet and exercise ..
