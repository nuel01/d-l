( 5 . 5 ) • Hypercalcemia Following Treatment Discontinuation in Patients with Giant Cell Tumor of Bone and in Patients with Growing Skeletons : Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia , and manage as clinically appropriate .
( 5 . 6 , 8 . 4 ) • Multiple Vertebral Fractures ( MVF ) Following Treatment Discontinuation : When Xgeva treatment is discontinued , evaluate the individual patient ’ s risk for vertebral fractures .
( 5 . 7 ) • Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm .
Advise females of reproductive potential of potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception .
( 5 . 8 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Drug Products with Same Active Ingredient Xgeva includes the same active ingredient ( denosumab ) found in Prolia .
Patients receiving Xgeva should not take Prolia .
5 . 2 Hypersensitivity Clinically significant hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis has been reported with use of Xgeva .
Reactions may include hypotension , dyspnea , upper airway edema , lip swelling , rash , pruritus , and urticaria .
If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs , initiate appropriate therapy and discontinue Xgeva therapy permanently [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 3 Hypocalcemia Xgeva can cause severe symptomatic hypocalcemia , and fatal cases have been reported .
Correct pre - existing hypocalcemia prior to Xgeva treatment .
Monitor calcium levels , throughout Xgeva therapy , especially in the first weeks of initiating therapy , and administer calcium , magnesium , and vitamin D as necessary .
Concomitant use of calcimimetics and other drugs that can lower calcium levels may worsen hypocalcemia risk and serum calcium should be closely monitored .
Advise patients to contact a healthcare provider for symptoms of hypocalcemia [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 1 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 , 6 . 2 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
An increased risk of hypocalcemia has been observed in clinical trials of patients with increasing renal dysfunction , most commonly with severe dysfunction ( creatinine clearance less than 30 mL / min and / or on dialysis ) , and with inadequate / no calcium supplementation .
Monitor calcium levels and calcium and vitamin D intake [ seeAdverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 4 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw ( ONJ ) Osteonecrosis of the jaw ( ONJ ) has been reported in patients receiving Xgeva , manifesting as jaw pain , osteomyelitis , osteitis , bone erosion , tooth or periodontal infection , toothache , gingival ulceration , or gingival erosion .
Persistent pain or slow healing of the mouth or jaw after dental surgery may also be manifestations of ONJ .
In clinical trials in patients with cancer , the incidence of ONJ was higher with longer duration of exposure [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Seventy - nine percent of patients with ONJ had a history of tooth extraction , poor oral hygiene , or use of a dental appliance as a predisposing factor .
Other risk factors for the development of ONJ include immunosuppressive therapy , treatment with angiogenesis inhibitors , systemic corticosteroids , diabetes , and gingival infections .
Similarly , for Xgeva patients with multiple myeloma that developed ONJ , 58 % had a history of invasive dental procedures as a predisposing factor .
Perform an oral examination and appropriate preventive dentistry prior to the initiation of Xgeva and periodically during Xgeva therapy .
Advise patients regarding oral hygiene practices .
Avoid invasive dental procedures during treatment with Xgeva .
Consider temporary discontinuation of Xgeva therapy if an invasive dental procedure must be performed .
There are no data available to suggest the optimal duration of treatment interruption .
Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ while on Xgeva should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon .
In these patients , extensive dental surgery to treat ONJ may exacerbate the condition .
Clinical judgment of the treating healthcare provider should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual risk / benefit assessment .
5 . 5 Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Femoral Fracture Atypical femoral fracture has been reported with Xgeva [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
These fractures can occur anywhere in the femoral shaft from just below the lesser trochanter to above the supracondylar flare and are transverse or short oblique in orientation without evidence of comminution .
Atypical femoral fractures most commonly occur with minimal or no trauma to the affected area .
They may be bilateral and many patients report prodromal pain in the affected area , usually presenting as dull , aching thigh pain , weeks to months before a complete fracture occurs .
A number of reports note that patients were also receiving treatment with glucocorticoids ( e . g . prednisone ) at the time of fracture .
During Xgeva treatment , patients should be advised to report new or unusual thigh , hip , or groin pain .
Any patient who presents with thigh or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture .
Patient presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb .
Interruption of Xgeva therapy should be considered , pending a risk / benefit assessment , on an individual basis .
5 . 6 Hypercalcemia Following Treatment Discontinuation in Patients with Giant Cell Tumor of Bone and in Patients with Growing Skeletons Clinically significant hypercalcemia requiring hospitalization and complicated by acute renal injury has been reported in Xgeva - treated patients with giant cell tumor of bone and patients with growing skeletons .
Hypercalcemia has been reported within the first year after treatment discontinuation .
After treatment is discontinued , monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia , assess serum calcium periodically , reevaluate the patient ’ s calcium and vitamin D supplementation requirements and manage patients as clinically appropriate [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 7 Multiple Vertebral Fractures ( MVF ) Following Treatment Discontinuation Multiple vertebral fractures ( MVF ) have been reported following discontinuation of treatment with denosumab .
Patients at higher risk for MVF include those with risk factors for or a history of osteoporosis or prior fractures .
When Xgeva treatment is discontinued , evaluate the individual patient ’ s risk for vertebral fractures [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 8 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action , Xgeva can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of denosumab to cynomolgus monkeys throughout pregnancy at a dose 25 - fold higher than the recommended human dose of Xgeva based on body weight resulted in increased fetal loss , stillbirths , and postnatal mortality , along with evidence of absent peripheral lymph nodes , abnormal bone growth and decreased neonatal growth .
Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of Xgeva .
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential that exposure to Xgeva during pregnancy or within 5 months prior to conception can result in fetal harm .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy , and for at least 5 months after the last dose of Xgeva [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .

The adverse reaction profile appeared similar in skeletally mature adolescents and adults .
Hypocalcemia and Hypophosphatemia • Moderate to severe hypocalcemia ( corrected serum calcium less than 8 mg / dL or less than 2 mmol / L ) occurred in 5 % of patients treated with Xgeva .
• Severe hypophosphatemia ( serum phosphorus less than 2 to 1 mg / dL or less than 0 . 6 to 0 . 3 mmol / L ) occurred in 20 % of patients treated with Xgeva .
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw ( ONJ ) In Study 20062004 and Study 20040215 , ONJ was confirmed in 6 . 6 % of patients who received Xgeva .
[ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Atypical Subtrochanteric and Diaphyseal Fracture Atypical femoral fracture has been reported with Xgeva and was observed in 0 . 9 % of patients in the pooled safety population [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
Hypercalcemia Following Treatment Discontinuation In the pooled safety population , 0 . 7 % of patients experienced serious adverse events of hypercalcemia > 30 days following treatment discontinuation that was recurrent in some patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
Hypercalcemia of Malignancy Xgeva was evaluated in an open - label , single - arm trial ( Study 20070315 ) in which 33 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy ( with or without bone metastases ) refractory to treatment with intravenous bisphosphonate therapy were enrolled [ see Clinical Trials ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
The adverse reaction profile of Xgeva in patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy was similar to that reported in Studies 20050136 , 20050244 , 20050103 , 20062004 , and 20040215 .
Adverse reactions occurring in greater than 20 % of patients were nausea ( 30 % ) , dyspnea ( 27 % ) , decreased appetite ( 24 % ) , headache ( 24 % ) , peripheral edema ( 24 % ) , vomiting ( 24 % ) , anemia ( 21 % ) , constipation ( 21 % ) , and diarrhea ( 21 % ) .
The following adverse reactions of Grade 3 or greater severity related to study therapy were reported on - study : fatigue ( 3 % ) and infection ( 6 % ) .
Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities included hypomagnesemia ( 3 % ) , hypokalemia ( 3 % ) , and hypophosphatemia ( 76 % ) of patients .
No deaths on - study were related to Xgeva therapy .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Xgeva .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Hypocalcemia : Severe symptomatic hypocalcemia , including fatal cases [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 1 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
• Hypercalcemia : Severe symptomatic hypercalcemia following treatment discontinuation can occur [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
• Hypersensitivity , including anaphylactic reactions [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 2 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
• Musculoskeletal pain , including severe musculoskeletal pain .
Positive re - challenge has been reported .
• Lichenoid drug eruptions ( e . g . , lichen planus - like reactions ) .
• Alopecia .
6 . 3 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is potential for immunogenicity .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies to denosumab in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies to other studies or to other products may be misleading .
Using an electrochemiluminescent bridging immunoassay , less than 1 % ( 7 / 2758 ) of patients with osseous metastases treated with denosumab doses ranging from 30 - 180 mg every 4 weeks or every 12 weeks for up to 3 years tested positive for binding antibodies against denosumab .
None of the 37 patients with giant cell tumor of bone in Study 20040215 tested positive for binding antibodies against denosumab .
Three of the 506 patients with giant cell tumor of bone in Study 20062004 tested positive for transient binding antibodies following treatment with denosumab .
In multiple myeloma patients in Study 20090482 , 1 out of 199 patients with a post - baseline result , tested positive for binding antibodies against denosumab .
No patient with positive binding antibodies tested positive for neutralizing antibodies as assessed using a chemiluminescent cell - based in vitro biological assay .
There was no evidence of altered pharmacokinetic profile , toxicity profile , or clinical response to denosumab associated with binding antibody development .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pediatric patients : Recommended only for treatment of skeletally mature adolescents with giant cell tumor of bone .
( 8 . 4 ) • Renal impairment : Patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL / min or receiving dialysis are at risk for hypocalcemia .
Adequately supplement with calcium and vitamin D . ( 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action , Xgeva can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are insufficient data with denosumab use in pregnant women to inform any drug associated risks for adverse developmental outcomes .
In utero denosumab exposure from cynomolgus monkeys dosed monthly with denosumab throughout pregnancy at a dose 25 - fold higher than the recommended human dose of Xgeva based on body weight resulted in increased fetal loss , stillbirths , and postnatal mortality ; and absent lymph nodes , abnormal bone growth , and decreased neonatal growth [ see Data ] .
Apprise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus .
The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data The effects of denosumab on prenatal development have been studied in both cynomolgus monkeys and genetically engineered mice in which RANK ligand ( RANKL ) expression was turned off by gene removal ( a “ knockout mouse ” ) .
In cynomolgus monkeys dosed subcutaneously with denosumab throughout pregnancy starting at gestational day 20 and at a pharmacologically active dose 25 - fold higher than the recommended human dose of Xgeva based on body weight , there was increased fetal loss during gestation , stillbirths , and postnatal mortality .
Other findings in offspring included absence of axillary , inguinal , mandibular , and mesenteric lymph nodes ; abnormal bone growth , reduced bone strength , reduced hematopoiesis , dental dysplasia , and tooth malalignment ; and decreased neonatal growth .
At birth out to one month of age , infants had measurable blood levels of denosumab ( 22 - 621 % of maternal levels ) .
Following a recovery period from birth out to 6 months of age , the effects on bone quality and strength returned to normal ; there were no adverse effects on tooth eruption , though dental dysplasia was still apparent ; axillary and inguinal lymph nodes remained absent , while mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes were present , though small ; and minimal to moderate mineralization in multiple tissues was seen in one recovery animal .
There was no evidence of maternal harm prior to labor ; adverse maternal effects occurred infrequently during labor .
Maternal mammary gland development was normal .
There was no fetal NOAEL ( no observable adverse effect level ) established for this study because only one dose of 50 mg / kg was evaluated .
Mammary gland histopathology at 6 months of age was normal in female offspring exposed to denosumab in utero ; however , development and lactation have not been fully evaluated .
In RANKL knockout mice , absence of RANKL ( the target of denosumab ) also caused fetal lymph node agenesis and led to postnatal impairment of dentition and bone growth .
Pregnant RANKL knockout mice showed altered maturation of the maternal mammary gland , leading to impaired lactation [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of Xgeva ( denosumab ) in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Denosumab was detected in the maternal milk of cynomolgus monkeysup to 1 month after the last dose of denosumab ( ≤ 0 . 5 % milk : serum ratio ) and maternal mammary gland development was normal , with no impaired lactation .
However , pregnant RANKL knockout mice showed altered maturation of the maternal mammary gland , leading to impaired lactation [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 2 ) ] .
Consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother ’ s clinical need for Xgeva treatment and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Xgeva or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action , Xgeva can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Xgeva treatment .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy , and for at least 5 months after the last dose of Xgeva .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of Xgeva have not been established in pediatric patients except in skeletally mature adolescents ( aged 12 – 16 years ) with giant cell tumor of bone .
Xgeva is recommended only for treatment of skeletally mature adolescents ( aged 12 – 16 years ) with giant cell tumor of bone [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 . 2 ) ] .
Clinically significant hypercalcemia after treatment discontinuation has been reported in pediatric patients with growing skeletons who received denosumab for giant cell tumor of bone or for unapproved indications [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
Xgeva was studied in an open - label trial that enrolled a subset of 19 adolescent patients ( aged 12 - 16 years ) with giant cell tumor of bone who had reached skeletal maturity , defined by at least 1 mature long bone ( e . g . , closed epiphyseal growth plate of the humerus ) , and had a body weight ≥ 45 kg [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 . 2 ) and Clinical Trials ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
A total of one of five ( 20 % ) evaluable adolescent patients had an objective response by retrospective independent assessment of radiographic response according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST 1 . 1 ) .
The adverse reaction profile and efficacy results appeared to be similar in skeletally mature adolescents and adults [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Clinical Trials ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Animal Data Treatment with Xgeva may impair bone growth in children with open growth plates and may inhibit eruption of dentition .
In neonatal rats , inhibition of RANKL ( the target of Xgeva therapy ) with a construct of osteoprotegerin bound to Fc ( OPG - Fc ) at doses ≤ 10 mg / kg was associated with inhibition of bone growth and tooth eruption .
Adolescent primates treated with denosumab at doses 5 and 25 times ( 10 and 50 mg / kg dose ) higher than the recommended human dose of 120 mg administered once every 4 weeks , based on body weight ( mg / kg ) , had abnormal growth plates , considered to be consistent with the pharmacological activity of denosumab .
Cynomolgus monkeys exposed in utero to denosumab exhibited bone abnormalities , reduced hematopoiesis , tooth malalignment , decreased neonatal growth , and an absence of axillary , inguinal , mandibular , and mesenteric lymph nodes .
Some bone abnormalities recovered once exposure was ceased following birth ; however , axillary and inguinal lymph nodes remained absent 6 months post - birth [ seeUse in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients in clinical studies that received Xgeva ( n = 2841 ) in Studies 20050136 , 20050244 , and 20050103 , 1271 ( 44 % ) were ≥ 65 years old , while 473 patients ( 17 % ) were ≥ 75 years old .
Of the 859 patients in Study 20090482 that received Xgeva , 387 patients ( 45 % ) were ≥ 65 years old , while 141 patients ( 16 % ) were ≥ 75 years old .
No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between older and younger patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Two clinical trials were conducted in patients without cancer and with varying degrees of renal function .
In one study , patients ( N = 55 ) with varying degrees of renal function ( ranging from normal through end - stage renal disease requiring dialysis ) received a single 60 mg subcutaneous dose of denosumab .
In a second study , patients ( N = 32 ) with severe renal dysfunction ( creatinine clearance less than 30 mL / min and / or on dialysis ) were given two 120 mg subcutaneous doses of denosumab .
In both studies , greater risk of developing hypocalcemia was observed with increasing renal impairment , and with inadequate / no calcium supplementation .
Hypocalcemia was mild to moderate in severity in 96 % of patients .
Monitor calcium levels and calcium and vitamin D intake [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no experience with overdosage of Xgeva .
11 DESCRIPTION Xgeva ( denosumab ) is a human IgG2 monoclonal antibody that binds to human RANKL .
Denosumab has an approximate molecular weight of 147 kDa and is produced in genetically engineered mammalian ( Chinese hamster ovary ) cells .
Xgeva is a sterile , preservative - free , clear , colorless to pale yellow solution .
Each single - dose vial of Xgeva contains 120 mg denosumab , acetate ( 18 mM ) , polysorbate 20 ( 0 . 01 % ) , sorbitol ( 4 . 6 % ) , Water for Injection ( USP ) , and sodium hydroxide to a pH of 5 . 2 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Xgeva binds to RANKL , a transmembrane or soluble protein essential for the formation , function , and survival of osteoclasts , the cells responsible for bone resorption , thereby modulating calcium release from bone .
Increased osteoclast activity , stimulated by RANKL , is a mediator of bone pathology in solid tumors with osseous metastases .
Similarly , giant cell tumors of bone consist of stromal cells expressing RANKL and osteoclast - like giant cells expressing RANK receptor , and signaling through the RANK receptor contributes to osteolysis and tumor growth .
Xgeva prevents RANKL from activating its receptor , RANK , on the surface of osteoclasts , their precursors , and osteoclast - like giant cells .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with breast cancer and bone metastases , the median reduction in uNTx / Cr was 82 % within 1 week following initiation of Xgeva 120 mg administered subcutaneously .
In Studies 20050136 , 20050244 , and 20050103 , the median reduction in uNTx / Cr from baseline to Month 3 was approximately 80 % in 2075 Xgeva - treated patients .
In a phase 3 study of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who received subcutaneous doses of Xgeva 120 mg every 4 weeks ( Q4W ) , median reductions in uNTx / Cr of approximately 75 % were observed by week 5 .
Reductions in bone turnover markers were maintained , with median reductions of 74 % to 79 % for uNTx / Cr from weeks 9 to 49 of continued 120 mg Q4W dosing .
In adult and skeletally mature adolescent patients with giant cell tumor of bone who received subcutaneous doses of Xgeva 120 mg Q4W with a 120 mg loading dose on Days 8 and 15 , median reductions in uNTx / Cr from baseline were 84 % at Week 13 and 82 % at Week 25 .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following subcutaneous administration , bioavailability was 62 % .
Denosumab displayed nonlinear pharmacokinetics at doses below 60 mg , but approximately dose - proportional increases in exposure at higher doses .
With multiple subcutaneous doses of 120 mg once every 4 weeks , up to 2 . 8 - fold accumulation in serum denosumab concentrations was observed and steady - state was achieved by 6 months .
A mean ( ± standard deviation ) serum steady - state trough concentration of 20 . 5 ( ± 13 . 5 ) mcg / mL was achieved by 6 months .
The mean elimination half - life was 28 days .
In patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who received 120 mg every 4 weeks , denosumab concentrations appear to reach steady - state by month 6 .
In patients with giant cell tumor of bone , after administration of subcutaneous doses of 120 mg once every 4 weeks with additional 120 mg doses on Days 8 and 15 of the first month of therapy , mean ( ± standard deviation ) serum trough concentrations on Day 8 , 15 , and one month after the first dose were 19 . 0 ( ± 24 . 1 ) , 31 . 6 ( ± 27 . 3 ) , 36 . 4 ( ± 20 . 6 ) mcg / mL , respectively .
Steady - state was achieved in 3 months after initiation of treatment with a mean serum trough concentration of 23 . 4 ( ± 12 . 1 ) mcg / mL .
Special Populations Body Weight : A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of demographic characteristics .
Denosumab clearance and volume of distribution were proportional to body weight .
The steady - state exposure following repeat subcutaneous administration of 120 mg every 4 weeks to 45 kg and 120 kg subjects were , respectively , 48 % higher and 46 % lower than exposure of the typical 66 kg subject .
Age , Gender and Race : The pharmacokinetics of denosumab was not affected by age , gender , and race .
Pediatrics : In skeletally - mature adolescent patients ( 12 to 16 years of age ) with giant cell tumor of bone ( GCTB ) who received 120 mg every 4 weeks with a 120 mg loading dose on Days 8 and 15 , the pharmacokinetics of denosumab were comparable to those observed in adult patients with GCTB .
Hepatic Impairment : No clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of denosumab .
Renal Impairment : In clinical trials of 87 patients with varying degrees of renal dysfunction , including patients on dialysis , the degree of renal impairment had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of denosumab [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Drug Interactions No formal drug - drug interaction trials have been conducted with Xgeva .
There was no evidence that various anticancer treatments affected denosumab systemic exposure and pharmacodynamic effect .
Serum denosumab concentrations at 1 and 3 months and reductions in the bone turnover marker uNTx / Cr ( urinary N - terminal telopeptide corrected for creatinine ) at 3 months were similar in patients with and without prior intravenous bisphosphonate therapy and were not altered by concomitant chemotherapy and / or hormone therapy .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of denosumab has not been evaluated in long - term animal studies .
The genotoxic potential of denosumab has not been evaluated .
Denosumab had no effect on female fertility or male reproductive organs in monkeys at doses that were 6 . 5 - to 25 - fold higher than the recommended human dose of 120 mg subcutaneously administered once every 4 weeks , based on body weight ( mg / kg ) .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Denosumab is an inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption via inhibition of RANKL .
Because the biological activity of denosumab in animals is specific to nonhuman primates , evaluation of genetically engineered ( knockout ) mice or use of other biological inhibitors of the RANK / RANKL pathway , OPG - Fc and RANK - Fc , provided additional information on the pharmacodynamic properties of denosumab .
RANK / RANKL knockout mice exhibited absence of lymph node formation , as well as an absence of lactation due to inhibition of mammary gland maturation ( lobulo - alveolar gland development during pregnancy ) .
Neonatal RANK / RANKL knockout mice exhibited reduced bone growth and lack of tooth eruption .
A corroborative study in 2 - week - old rats given the RANKL inhibitor OPG - Fc also showed reduced bone growth , altered growth plates , and impaired tooth eruption .
These changes were partially reversible in this model when dosing with the RANKL inhibitors was discontinued .
14 CLINICAL TRIALS [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 1 Bone Metastasis from Solid Tumors The safety and efficacy of Xgeva for the prevention of skeletal - related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors was demonstrated in three international , randomized ( 1 : 1 ) , double - blind , active - controlled , noninferiority trials comparing Xgeva with zoledronic acid .
In all three trials , patients were randomized to receive 120 mg Xgeva subcutaneously every 4 weeks or 4 mg zoledronic acid intravenously ( IV ) every 4 weeks ( dose adjusted for reduced renal function ) .
Patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL / min were excluded .
In each trial , the main outcome measure was demonstration of noninferiority of time to first skeletal - related event ( SRE ) as compared to zoledronic acid .
Supportive outcome measures were superiority of time to first SRE and superiority of time to first and subsequent SRE ; testing for these outcome measures occurred if the main outcome measure was statistically significant .
An SRE was defined as any of the following : pathologic fracture , radiation therapy to bone , surgery to bone , or spinal cord compression .
Study 20050136 ( NCT00321464 ) enrolled 2046 patients with advanced breast cancer and bone metastasis .
Randomization was stratified by a history of prior SRE ( yes or no ) , receipt of chemotherapy within 6 weeks prior to randomization ( yes or no ) , prior oral bisphosphonate use ( yes or no ) , and region ( Japan or other countries ) .
Forty percent of patients had a previous SRE , 40 % received chemotherapy within 6 weeks prior to randomization , 5 % received prior oral bisphosphonates , and 7 % were enrolled from Japan .
Median age was 57 years , 80 % of patients were White , and 99 % of patients were women .
The median number of doses administered was 18 for denosumab and 17 for zoledronic acid .
Study 20050244 ( NCT00330759 ) enrolled 1776 adults with solid tumors other than breast and castrate - resistant prostate cancer with bone metastasis and multiple myeloma .
Randomization was stratified by previous SRE ( yes or no ) , systemic anticancer therapy at time of randomization ( yes or no ) , and tumor type ( non - small cell lung cancer , myeloma , or other ) .
Eighty - seven percent were receiving systemic anticancer therapy at the time of randomization , 52 % had a previous SRE , 64 % of patients were men , 87 % were White , and the median age was 60 years .
A total of 40 % of patients had non - small cell lung cancer , 10 % had multiple myeloma , 9 % had renal cell carcinoma , and 6 % had small cell lung cancer .
Other tumor types each comprised less than 5 % of the enrolled population .
The median number of doses administered was 7 for both denosumab and zoledronic acid .
Study 20050103 ( NCT00321620 ) enrolled 1901 men with castrate - resistant prostate cancer and bone metastasis .
Randomization was stratified by previous SRE , PSA level ( less than 10 ng / mL or 10 ng / mL or greater ) and receipt of chemotherapy within 6 weeks prior to randomization ( yes or no ) .
Twenty - six percent of patients had a previous SRE , 15 % of patients had PSA less than 10 ng / mL , and 14 % received chemotherapy within 6 weeks prior to randomization .
Median age was 71 years and 86 % of patients were White .
The median number of doses administered was 13 for denosumab and 11 for zoledronic acid .
Xgeva delayed the time to first SRE following randomization as compared to zoledronic acid in patients with breast or castrate - resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) with osseous metastases ( Table 2 ) .
In patients with bone metastasis due to other solid tumors or lytic lesions due to multiple myeloma , Xgeva was noninferior to zoledronic acid in delaying the time to first SRE following randomization .
Overall survival and progression - free survival were similar between arms in all three trials .

14 . 2 Multiple Myeloma The efficacy of Xgeva for the prevention of skeletal - related events in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients with treatment through disease progression , was evaluated in Study 20090482 ( NCT01345019 ) , an international , randomized ( 1 : 1 ) , double - blind , active - controlled , noninferiority trial comparing Xgeva with zoledronic acid .
In this trial , patients were randomized to receive 120 mg Xgeva subcutaneously every 4 weeks or 4 mg zoledronic acid intravenously ( IV ) every 4 weeks ( dose adjusted for reduced renal function ) .
Patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL / min were excluded .
In this trial , the main efficacy outcome measure was noninferiority of time to first skeletal - related event ( SRE ) .
Additional efficacy outcome measures were superiority of time to first SRE , time to first and subsequent SRE , and overall survival .
An SRE was defined as any of the following : pathologic fracture , radiation therapy to bone , surgery to bone , or spinal cord compression .
Study 20090482 enrolled 1718 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients with bone lesions .
Randomization was stratified by a history of prior SRE ( yes or no ) , the anti - myeloma agent being utilized / planned to be utilized in first - line therapy ( novel therapy - based or non - novel therapy - based [ novel therapies include bortezomib , lenalidomide , or thalidomide ] ) , intent to undergo autologous PBSC transplantation ( yes or no ) , stage at diagnosis ( International Staging System I or II or III ) and region Japan ( yes or no ) .
At study enrollment , 96 % of the patients were receiving or planning to receive novel therapy - based first - line anti - myeloma therapy , 55 % of the patients intended to undergo autologous PBSC transplantation , 61 % of patients had a previous SRE , 32 % were at ISS stage I , 38 % were at ISS stage II and 29 % were at ISS Stage III , and 2 % were enrolled from Japan .
Median age was 63 years , 82 % of patients were White , and 46 % of patients were women .
The median number of doses administered was 16 for Xgeva and 15 for zoledronic acid .
Xgeva was noninferior to zoledronic acid in delaying the time to first SRE following randomization ( HR = 0 . 98 , 95 % CI , 0 . 85 - 1 . 14 ) .
The results for overall survival ( OS ) were comparable between Xgeva and zoledronic acid treatment groups with a hazard ratio of 0 . 90 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 70 , 1 . 16 ) .

Patients received 120 mg Xgeva subcutaneously every 4 weeks with a loading dose on Days 8 and 15 of the first cycle of therapy .
Patients who discontinued Xgeva then entered the safety follow - up phase for a minimum of 60 months .
Retreatment with Xgeva while in safety follow - up was allowed for patients who initially demonstrated a response to Xgeva ( e . g . , in the case of recurrent disease ) .
Study 20040215 was a single - arm , pharmacodynamic , and proof of concept trial conducted in 37 adult patients with unresectable or recurrent giant cell tumor of bone .
Patients were required to have histologically confirmed giant cell tumor of bone and radiologic evidence of measurable disease from a computed tomography ( CT ) or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) obtained within 28 days prior to study enrollment .
Patients enrolled in Study 20040215 underwent CT or MRI assessment of giant cell tumor of bone at baseline and quarterly during Xgeva treatment .
Study 20062004 was a parallel - cohort , proof of concept , and safety trial conducted in 535 adult or skeletally mature adolescent patients with histologically confirmed giant cell tumor of bone and evidence of measurable active disease .
Study 20062004 enrolled 19 patients who were 12 - 16 years of age [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Patients enrolled into one of three cohorts : Cohort 1 enrolled 268 patients with surgically unsalvageable disease ( e . g . , sacral or spinal sites of disease , or pulmonary metastases ) ; Cohort 2 enrolled 252 patients with surgically salvageable disease where the investigator determined that the planned surgery was likely to result in severe morbidity ( e . g . , joint resection , limb amputation , or hemipelvectomy ) ; Cohort 3 enrolled 15 patients who previously participated in Study 20040215 .
Patients underwent imaging assessment of disease status at intervals determined by their treating physician .
A retrospective interim analysis concluded by an independent review committee evaluated objective response in 187 patients enrolled and treated in Study 20040215 and Study 20062004 for whom baseline and at least one post - baseline radiographic assessment were available ( 27 of 37 patients enrolled in Study 20040215 and 160 of 270 patients enrolled in Cohorts 1 and 2 of Study 20062004 ) .
The primary efficacy outcome measure was objective response rate using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v 1 . 1 .
The overall objective response rate ( RECIST 1 . 1 ) was 25 % ( 95 % CI : 19 , 32 ) .
All responses were partial responses .
The estimated median time to response was 3 months .
In the 47 patients with an objective response , the median duration of follow - up was 20 months ( range : 2 - 44 months ) , and 51 % ( 24 / 47 ) had a duration of response lasting at least 8 months .
Three patients experienced disease progression following an objective response .
14 . 4 Hypercalcemia of Malignancy The safety and efficacy of Xgeva was demonstrated in an open - label , single - arm trial [ Study 20070315 ( NCT00896454 ) ] that enrolled 33 patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy ( with or without bone metastases ) refractory to treatment with intravenous bisphosphonate therapy .
Patients received Xgeva subcutaneously every 4 weeks with additional 120 mg doses on Days 8 and 15 of the first month of therapy .
In this trial , refractory hypercalcemia of malignancy was defined as an albumin - corrected calcium of > 12 . 5 mg / dL ( 3 . 1 mmol / L ) despite treatment with intravenous bisphosphonate therapy in 7 - 30 days prior to initiation of Xgeva therapy .
The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients achieving a response , defined as corrected serum calcium ( CSC ) ≤ 11 . 5 mg / dL ( 2 . 9 mmol / L ) , within 10 days after Xgeva administration .
Efficacy data are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 4 .
Concurrent chemotherapy did not appear to affect response to Xgeva .
