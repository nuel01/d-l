( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS VEKLURY is contraindicated in patients with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions to VEKLURY or any components of the product [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
VEKLURY is contraindicated in patients with a history of clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions to VEKLURY or any components of the product .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypersensitivity including infusion - related and anaphylactic reactions : Hypersensitivity reactions have been observed during and following administration of VEKLURY .
Slower infusion rates , with a maximum infusion time of up to 120 minutes , can be considered to potentially prevent signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity .
Monitor patients during infusion and observe patients for at least one hour after infusion is complete for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity as clinically appropriate .
If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occur , immediately discontinue administration of VEKLURY and initiate appropriate treatment .
( 5 . 1 ) • Increased risk of transaminase elevations : Transaminase elevations have been observed in healthy volunteers and have also been reported in patients with COVID - 19 who received VEKLURY .
Perform hepatic laboratory testing in all patients before starting VEKLURY and while receiving VEKLURY as clinically appropriate .
Consider discontinuing VEKLURY if ALT levels increase to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal .
Discontinue VEKLURY if ALT elevation is accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver inflammation .
( 5 . 2 ) • Risk of reduced antiviral activity when coadministered with chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate : Coadministration of VEKLURY and chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended based on data from cell culture experiments demonstrating a potential antagonistic effect of chloroquine on the intracellular metabolic activation and antiviral activity of VEKLURY .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Including Infusion - related and Anaphylactic Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions , including infusion - related and anaphylactic reactions , have been observed during and following administration of VEKLURY ; most occurred within one hour .
Signs and symptoms may include hypotension , hypertension , tachycardia , bradycardia , hypoxia , fever , dyspnea , wheezing , angioedema , rash , nausea , diaphoresis , and shivering .
Slower infusion rates , with a maximum infusion time of up to 120 minutes , can be considered to potentially prevent these signs and symptoms .
Monitor patients during infusion and observe patients for at least one hour after infusion is complete for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity as clinically appropriate .
If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occur , immediately discontinue administration of VEKLURY and initiate appropriate treatment .
The use of VEKLURY is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to VEKLURY or any components of the product [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
5 . 2 Increased Risk of Transaminase Elevations Transaminase elevations have been observed in healthy volunteers who received 200 mg of VEKLURY followed by 100 mg doses for up to 10 days ; the transaminase elevations were mild ( Grade 1 ) to moderate ( Grade 2 ) in severity and resolved upon discontinuation of VEKLURY .
Transaminase elevations have also been reported in patients with COVID - 19 who received VEKLURY [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Because transaminase elevations have been reported as a clinical feature of COVID - 19 , and the incidence was similar in patients receiving placebo versus VEKLURY in clinical trials of VEKLURY , discerning the contribution of VEKLURY to transaminase elevations in patients with COVID - 19 can be challenging .
Perform hepatic laboratory testing in all patients before starting VEKLURY and while receiving VEKLURY as clinically appropriate [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
• Consider discontinuing VEKLURY if ALT levels increase to greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal .
• Discontinue VEKLURY if ALT elevation is accompanied by signs or symptoms of liver inflammation .
5 . 3 Risk of Reduced Antiviral Activity When Coadministered with Chloroquine Phosphate or Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate Coadministration of VEKLURY and chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended based on data from cell culture experiments demonstrating a potential antagonistic effect of chloroquine on the intracellular metabolic activation and antiviral activity of VEKLURY [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) and Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling : • Hypersensitivity Including Infusion - related and Anaphylactic Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Increased Risk of Transaminase Elevations [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] The most common adverse reactions ( incidence greater than or equal to 5 % , all grades ) observed with treatment with VEKLURY are nausea , ALT increased , and AST increased .

Study GS - US - 540 - 9012 was a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical trial in subjects who were non - hospitalized , were symptomatic for COVID - 19 for ≤ 7 days , had confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection , and had at least one risk factor for progression to hospitalization treated with VEKLURY ( n = 279 ; 276 adults and 3 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg ) or placebo ( n = 283 ; 278 adults and 5 pediatric subjects 12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kg ) for 3 days .
Of the 279 subjects treated with VEKLURY , 227 subjects received at least one dose of VEKLURY at an outpatient facility , 44 subjects received at least one dose of VEKLURY in a home healthcare setting , and 8 subjects received at least one dose of VEKLURY at a skilled nursing facility .
Subjects treated with VEKLURY received 200 mg on Day 1 and 100 mg once daily on subsequent days [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
Adverse reactions ( all grades ) were reported in 34 ( 12 % ) subjects in the VEKLURY group and 25 ( 9 % ) subjects in the placebo group .
The most common adverse reaction occurring in at least 5 % of subjects in the VEKLURY group was nausea ( 6 % ) .
There were no serious adverse reactions or adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation in either treatment group .
Safety in subjects who received VEKLURY in a home healthcare setting was comparable to that observed in the overall GS - US - 540 - 9012 study population , but these findings are based on limited data .
Less Common Adverse Reactions in Adults from Clinical Trials Clinically significant adverse reactions that were reported in < 2 % of subjects exposed to VEKLURY in clinical trials are listed below : • Hypersensitivity reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
• Generalized seizure • Rash Laboratory Abnormalities Study GS - US - 399 - 5505 was a Phase 1 , randomized , blinded , placebo - controlled clinical trial in healthy volunteers administered VEKLURY 200 mg on Day 1 and 100 mg for either 4 days or 9 days .
Mild ( Grade 1 , n = 8 ) to moderate ( Grade 2 , n = 1 ) elevations in ALT were observed in 9 of 20 subjects receiving 10 days of VEKLURY ; the elevations in ALT resolved upon discontinuation of VEKLURY .
No subjects ( 0 of 9 ) who received 5 days of VEKLURY had graded increases in ALT .
The frequencies of laboratory abnormalities ( Grades 3 – 4 ) occurring in at least 3 % of subjects with COVID - 19 receiving VEKLURY in Trials NIAID ACTT - 1 , 5773 , and 5774 are presented in Table 8 , Table 9 , and Table 10 , respectively .

Clinical Trials in Pediatric Subjects Study GS - US - 540 - 5823 was a Phase 2 / 3 , single - arm , open - label clinical trial in hospitalized subjects 28 days of age and older and weighing at least 3 kg with mild , moderate , and severe COVID - 19 treated with weight - based VEKLURY ( n = 53 ) for up to 10 days [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 6 ) ] : • Subjects ≥ 12 years and weighing ≥ 40 kg ( n = 12 ) and subjects < 12 years and weighing ≥ 40 kg ( n = 5 ) : Received 200 mg on Day 1 and 100 mg once daily on subsequent days .
• Subjects ≥ 28 days and weighing ≥ 20 to < 40 kg ( n = 12 ) ; subjects ≥ 28 days and weighing ≥ 12 to < 20 kg ( n = 12 ) ; and subjects ≥ 28 days and weighing ≥ 3 to < 12 kg ( n = 12 ) : Received 5 mg / kg on Day 1 and 2 . 5 mg / kg once daily on subsequent days .
The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those observed in clinical trials of VEKLURY in adults .
Adverse reactions ( all grades ) were reported in 8 ( 15 % ) subjects .
The most common adverse reaction occurring in at least 5 % of subjects was ALT increased ( 6 % ) .
No subjects experienced serious adverse reactions .
Two ( 4 % ) subjects permanently discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions ( ALT increased [ n = 1 ] , ALT increased and AST increased and hyperbilirubinemia [ n = 1 ] ) .
Laboratory abnormalities ( Grades 3 – 4 ) occurring in at least 3 % of subjects with COVID - 19 receiving VEKLURY in Trial 5823 and who had at least one post - baseline value for the specified test were hemoglobin decreased ( 18 % , 9 / 51 ) , eGFR decreased ( 18 % , 7 / 40 ) , creatinine increased ( 10 % , 5 / 52 ) , direct bilirubin increased ( 9 % , 2 / 23 ) , prothrombin time increased ( 7 % , 3 / 46 ) , APTT increased ( 7 % , 3 / 45 ) , lymphocytes decreased ( 6 % 2 / 33 ) , proteinuria ( 6 % , 2 / 36 ) , WBC decreased ( 4 % , 2 / 51 ) , ALT increased ( 4 % , 2 / 51 ) , glucose increased ( 4 % , 2 / 52 ) , glycosuria ( 4 % , 2 / 46 ) , potassium decreased ( 4 % , 2 / 52 ) .
Emergency Use Authorization Experience in Subjects with COVID - 19 The following adverse reactions have been identified during use of VEKLURY under Emergency Use Authorization : • General disorders and administration site conditions : Administration site extravasation • Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Rash • Immune system disorders : Anaphylaxis , angioedema , infusion - related reactions , hypersensitivity • Investigations : Transaminase elevations 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Due to potential antagonism based on data from cell culture experiments , concomitant use of VEKLURY with chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
Remdesivir and its metabolites are in vitro substrates and / or inhibitors of certain drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters .
Based on a drug interaction study conducted with VEKLURY , no clinically significant drug interactions are expected with inducers of cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 or inhibitors of Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptides ( OATP ) 1B1 / 1B3 , and P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in individuals exposed to VEKLURY during pregnancy .
Pregnant and recently pregnant individuals can go to https : / / covid - pr . pregistry . com to enroll or call 1 - 800 - 616 - 3791 to obtain information about the registry .
Risk Summary Available data from published case reports and compassionate use of remdesivir in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies , remdesivir demonstrated no adverse effect on embryo - fetal development when administered to pregnant animals at systemic exposures ( AUC ) of the predominant circulating metabolite of remdesivir ( GS - 441524 ) that were 4 times ( rats and rabbits ) the exposure in humans at the recommended human dose ( RHD ) ( see Data ) .
There are maternal and fetal risks associated with untreated COVID - 19 in pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo - fetal risk COVID - 19 in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes , including preeclampsia , eclampsia , preterm birth , premature rupture of membranes , venous thromboembolic disease , and fetal death .
Data Animal Data Remdesivir was administered via intravenous injection to pregnant rats and rabbits ( up to 20 mg / kg / day ) on Gestation Days 6 through 17 , and 7 through 20 , respectively , and also to rats from Gestation Day 6 to Lactation / Post - partum Day 20 .
No adverse effects on embryo - fetal ( rats and rabbits ) or pre / postnatal ( rats ) development were observed in rats and rabbits at nontoxic doses in pregnant animals .
During organogenesis , exposures to the predominant circulating metabolite ( GS - 441524 ) were 4 times higher ( rats and rabbits ) than the exposure in humans at the RHD .
In a pre / postnatal development study , exposures to the predominant circulating metabolite of remdesivir ( GS - 441524 ) were similar to the human exposures at the RHD .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no available data on the presence of remdesivir in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
In animal studies , remdesivir and metabolites have been detected in the nursing pups of mothers given remdesivir , likely due to the presence of remdesivir in milk ( see Data ) .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for VEKLURY and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from VEKLURY or from the underlying maternal condition .
Breastfeeding individuals with COVID - 19 should follow practices according to clinical guidelines to avoid exposing the infant to COVID - 19 .
Data Animal Data Remdesivir and its metabolites were detected in the plasma of nursing rat pups , likely due to the presence of remdesivir and / or its metabolites in milk , following daily intravenous administration of remdesivir to pregnant rats from Gestation Day 6 to Lactation Day 20 .
Exposures in nursing pups were approximately 1 % that of maternal exposure on Lactation Day 10 .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of VEKLURY for the treatment of COVID - 19 have been established in pediatric patients 28 days of age and older and weighing at least 3 kg , who are : • Hospitalized , or • Not hospitalized and have mild - to - moderate COVID - 19 , and are at high risk for progression to severe COVID - 19 , including hospitalization or death .
Use in this age group is supported by the following : • trials in adults [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 , 14 . 2 , 14 . 3 , 14 . 4 , 14 . 5 ) ] • an open - label trial ( Study 5823 ) in 53 hospitalized pediatric subjects [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 6 ) ] .
Use of VEKLURY in pediatric patients 28 days of age and older and weighing at least 3 kg is supported by Study 5823 where 53 hospitalized pediatric subjects were treated with weight - based VEKLURY for up to 10 days in the following cohorts : subjects ≥ 12 years and weighing ≥ 40 kg ( n = 12 ) ; subjects < 12 years and weighing ≥ 40 kg ( n = 5 ) ; subjects ≥ 28 days and weighing ≥ 20 to < 40 kg ( n = 12 ) ; subjects ≥ 28 days and weighing ≥ 12 to < 20 kg ( n = 12 ) ; and subjects ≥ 28 days and weighing ≥ 3 to < 12 kg ( n = 12 ) .
The safety and pharmacokinetic results in pediatric subjects in this group were similar to those in adults [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 6 ) ] .
Use of VEKLURY in pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg is further supported by a clinical trial of VEKLURY in non - hospitalized subjects that included 3 pediatric subjects 12 years and older , and by clinical trials in hospitalized subjects that included 30 adult subjects weighing 40 to 50 kg .
The safety in this weight group was comparable to adult subjects weighing greater than 50 kg .
Thirty - nine pediatric patients 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg received VEKLURY in a compassionate use program in hospitalized subjects ; the available clinical data from these patients are limited [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
All pediatric patients 28 days of age and older and weighing at least 3 kg must have eGFR determined before starting VEKLURY and while receiving VEKLURY as clinically appropriate [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 4 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of VEKLURY have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 28 days of age or weighing less than 3 kg .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 1 , 062 hospitalized subjects with SARS - CoV - 2 infection randomized in ACTT - 1 , 36 % were 65 years or older .
Of the 397 hospitalized subjects with SARS - CoV - 2 infection randomized in Study GS - US - 540 - 5773 , 42 % were 65 years or older .
Of the 584 hospitalized subjects with SARS - CoV - 2 infection randomized in Study GS - US - 540 - 5774 , 27 % were 65 years or older .
Of the 562 non - hospitalized subjects with SARS - CoV - 2 infection randomized in Study GS - US - 540 - 9012 , 17 % were 65 years or older .
Reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
No dosage adjustment is required in patients over the age of 65 years .
In general , appropriate caution should be exercised in the administration of VEKLURY and monitoring of elderly patients , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of VEKLURY have not been evaluated in patients with renal impairment .
Patients with eGFR greater than or equal to 30 mL per minute have received VEKLURY for treatment of COVID - 19 with no dose adjustment of VEKLURY [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
All patients must have an eGFR determined before starting VEKLURY and while receiving VEKLURY as clinically appropriate .
Because the excipient betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium is renally cleared and accumulates in patients with decreased renal function , administration of drugs formulated with betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium ( such as VEKLURY ) is not recommended in patients with eGFR less than 30 mL per minute [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 4 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of VEKLURY have not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment .
Perform hepatic laboratory testing in all patients before starting VEKLURY and while receiving VEKLURY as clinically appropriate [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no human experience of acute overdosage with VEKLURY .
Treatment of overdose with VEKLURY should consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient .
There is no specific antidote for overdose with VEKLURY .

Specific Populations Pharmacokinetic differences based on sex , race , age , renal function , and hepatic function on the exposures of remdesivir were evaluated using population pharmacokinetic analysis .
Sex and race did not affect the pharmacokinetics of remdesivir and its metabolites ( GS - 704277 and GS - 441524 ) .
Pediatric Patients Population pharmacokinetic models for remdesivir and its circulating metabolites ( GS - 704277 and GS - 441524 ) , developed using pooled data from studies in healthy subjects and in adult and pediatric patients with COVID - 19 , were used to estimate pharmacokinetic exposures in pediatric patients aged ≥ 28 days to < 18 years and weighing ≥ 3 kg ( Study 5823 ) .
Geometric mean estimated exposures ( AUCtau , Cmax , and Ctau ) for these patients at the doses administered were higher for remdesivir ( 33 % to 129 % ) , GS - 441524 ( 0 % to 60 % ) , and GS - 704277 ( 37 % to 124 % ) as compared to those in adult patients with COVID - 19 ; however , the increases were not considered clinically significant [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .

12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Remdesivir is an inhibitor of the SARS - CoV - 2 RNA - dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRp ) , which is essential for viral replication .
Remdesivir is an adenosine nucleotide prodrug that distributes into cells where it is metabolized to a nucleoside monophosphate intermediate by carboxyesterase 1 and / or cathepsin A , depending upon the cell type .
The nucleoside monophosphate is subsequently phosphorylated by cellular kinases to form the pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate metabolite ( GS - 443902 ) .
Remdesivir triphosphate ( RDV - TP ) acts as an analog of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) and competes with high selectivity ( 3 . 65 - fold ) over the natural ATP substrate for incorporation into nascent RNA chains by the SARS - CoV - 2 RNA - dependent RNA polymerase , which results in delayed chain termination ( position i + 3 ) during replication of the viral RNA .
In a biochemical assay assessing RDV - TP incorporation by the MERS - CoV RdRp complex , RDV - TP inhibited RNA synthesis with an IC50 value of 0 . 032 µM .
RDV - TP can also inhibit viral RNA synthesis following its incorporation into the template viral RNA as a result of read - through by the viral polymerase that may occur at higher nucleotide concentrations .
When remdesivir nucleotide is present in the viral RNA template , the efficiency of incorporation of the complementary natural nucleotide is compromised , thereby inhibiting viral RNA synthesis .
Remdesivir triphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA and RNA polymerases , including human mitochondrial RNA polymerase .
Antiviral Activity Cell Culture Antiviral Activity Remdesivir exhibited cell culture antiviral activity against a clinical isolate of SARS ‑ CoV ‑ 2 in primary human airway epithelial ( HAE ) cells with a 50 % effective concentration ( EC50 ) of 9 . 9 nM after 48 hours of treatment .
Remdesivir inhibited the replication of SARS - CoV - 2 in the continuous human lung epithelial cell lines Calu - 3 and A549 - hACE2 with EC50 values of 280 nM after 72 hours of treatment and 115 nM after 48 hours of treatment , respectively .
Remdesivir EC50 values for SARS - CoV - 2 in A549 - hACE2 cells were not different when combined with chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate at concentrations up to 2 . 5 μM .
In a separate study , the antiviral activity of remdesivir was antagonized by chloroquine phosphate in a dose - dependent manner when the two drugs were co - incubated at clinically relevant concentrations in HEp - 2 cells infected with respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) .
Higher remdesivir EC50 values were observed with increasing concentrations of chloroquine phosphate .
Increasing concentrations of chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate reduced formation of remdesivir triphosphate in A549 - hACE2 , HEp - 2 , and normal human bronchial epithelial cells .
Based on cell culture susceptibility testing by virus yield reduction assay and / or N protein ELISA assay , remdesivir retained similar antiviral activity ( < 2 . 5 - fold change ) against clinical isolates of SARS - CoV - 2 variants containing the P323L substitution in the viral polymerase including the Alpha ( B . 1 . 1 . 7 ) , Beta ( B . 1 . 351 ) , Gamma ( P . 1 ) , Epsilon ( B . 1 . 429 ) , Kappa ( B . 1 . 617 . 1 ) , Lambda ( C . 37 ) , Iota ( B . 1 . 526 ) , and Zeta ( P . 2 ) variants compared to earlier lineage SARS - CoV - 2 ( lineage A ) isolates .
For the clinical isolates of the Delta ( B . 1 . 617 . 2 ) and Omicron ( B . 1 . 1 . 529 / BA . 1 , BA . 2 , BA . 2 . 12 . 1 , BA . 4 , and BA . 5 ) variants , remdesivir maintained antiviral activity ( < 0 . 7 - fold change ) .
Clinical Antiviral Activity SARS - CoV - 2 RNA shedding results from GS - US - 540 - 5776 ( ACTT - 1 ) indicate that remdesivir does not significantly reduce the amount of detectable SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs or plasma samples in hospitalized patients compared to placebo , and SARS - CoV - 2 RNA shedding results from GS - US - 540 - 9012 indicate that remdesivir does not significantly reduce the amount of detectable SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs in non - hospitalized patients compared to placebo .
Resistance Cell Culture Resistance SARS - CoV - 2 isolates with reduced susceptibility to remdesivir have been selected in cell culture .
In a selection with GS - 441524 , the parent nucleoside of remdesivir , virus pools emerged expressing amino acid substitutions at V166A , N198S , S759A , V792I , C799F , and C799R in the viral RNA - dependent RNA polymerase ( nsp12 ) .
When these substitutions were individually introduced into a wild - type recombinant virus by site - directed mutagenesis , 1 . 7 - to 3 . 5 - fold reductions in susceptibility to remdesivir were observed .
In a cell culture resistance selection experiment with remdesivir , nsp12 amino acid substitution E802D emerged , resulting in a 2 . 5 - fold reduction in susceptibility to remdesivir .
In another selection with remdesivir using a SARS - CoV - 2 isolate containing the P323L substitution in the viral polymerase , a single amino acid substitution at V166L emerged .
Recombinant SARS - CoV - 2 with substitutions at P323L alone or P323L + V166L in combination exhibited 1 . 3 - and 1 . 5 - fold reductions in remdesivir susceptibility , respectively .
Cell culture resistance profiling of remdesivir using the rodent CoV murine hepatitis virus identified two substitutions ( F476L and V553L ) in the viral RNA - dependent RNA polymerase at residues conserved across CoVs .
Introduction of the corresponding substitutions ( F480L and V557L ) into SARS - CoV resulted in 6 - fold reduction in susceptibility to remdesivir in cell culture and attenuated SARS - CoV pathogenesis in a mouse model .
When individually introduced into a SARS - CoV - 2 recombinant virus , the corresponding substitutions at F480L and V557L each conferred 2 - fold reduced susceptibility to remdesivir .
Treatment - Emergent Resistance SARS - CoV - 2 nsp12 E802D substitution has emerged in one individual treated with remdesivir .
The E802D substitution resulted in a 2 . 5 - fold increase in the remdesivir EC50 value .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis Given the short - term administration of VEKLURY for the treatment of COVID - 19 , long - term animal studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of remdesivir were not conducted .
Remdesivir was not genotoxic in a battery of assays , including bacterial mutagenicity , chromosome aberration using human peripheral blood lymphocytes , and in vivo rat micronucleus assays .
Impairment of Fertility Nonclinical toxicity studies in rats demonstrated no adverse effect on male fertility at exposures of the predominant circulating metabolite ( GS - 441524 ) approximately 2 times the exposure in humans at the RHD .
Reproductive toxicity , including decreases in corpora lutea , numbers of implantation sites , and viable embryos , was seen when remdesivir was administered by daily intravenous administration at a systemically toxic dose ( 10 mg / kg ) in female rats 14 days prior to mating and during conception ; exposures of the predominant circulating metabolite ( GS - 441524 ) were 1 . 3 times the exposure in humans at the RHD .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Intravenous administration ( slow bolus ) of remdesivir to male rhesus monkeys at dosage levels of 5 , 10 , and 20 mg / kg / day for 7 days resulted , at all dose levels , in increased mean urea nitrogen and increased mean creatinine , renal tubular atrophy , and basophilia and casts .
Intravenous administration ( slow bolus ) of remdesivir to rats at dosage levels of ≥ 3 mg / kg / day for up to 4 weeks resulted in findings indicative of kidney injury and / or dysfunction .
Kidney - related effects in rats and monkeys were observed at exposures of the predominant circulating metabolite ( GS - 441524 ) that are lower than the exposure in humans at the RHD .

The most common comorbidities were hypertension ( 51 % ) , obesity ( 45 % ) , and type 2 diabetes mellitus ( 31 % ) ; the distribution of comorbidities was similar between the two treatment groups .
The primary clinical endpoint was time to recovery within 29 days after randomization .
Recovery was defined as discharged from the hospital without limitations on activities , discharged from the hospital with limitations on activities and / or requiring home oxygen , or hospitalized but not requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring ongoing medical care .
The median time to recovery was 10 days in the VEKLURY group compared to 15 days in the placebo group ( recovery rate ratio 1 . 29 [ 95 % CI 1 . 12 to 1 . 49 ] , p < 0 . 001 ) .
Among subjects with mild / moderate disease at enrollment ( n = 105 ) , the median time to recovery was 5 days in both the VEKLURY and placebo groups ( recovery rate ratio 1 . 22 [ 95 % CI 0 . 82 to 1 . 81 ] ) .
Among subjects with severe disease at enrollment ( n = 957 ) , the median time to recovery was 11 days in the VEKLURY group compared to 18 days in the placebo group ( recovery rate ratio 1 . 31 [ 95 % CI 1 . 12 to 1 . 52 ] ) .
A key secondary endpoint was clinical status on Day 15 assessed on an 8 - point ordinal scale consisting of the following categories : • not hospitalized , no limitations on activities ; • not hospitalized , limitation on activities and / or requiring home oxygen ; • hospitalized , not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care ; • hospitalized , not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care ( COVID - 19 related or otherwise ) ; • hospitalized , requiring supplemental oxygen ; • hospitalized , on noninvasive ventilation or high - flow oxygen devices ; • hospitalized , on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO ; and • death .
