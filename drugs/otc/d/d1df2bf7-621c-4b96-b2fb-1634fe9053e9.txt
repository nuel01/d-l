DESCRIPTION Humalog ® Mix75 / 25 ™ [ 75 % insulin lispro protamine suspension and 25 % insulin lispro injection , ( rDNA origin ) ] is a mixture of insulin lispro solution , a rapid – acting blood glucose – lowering agent and insulin lispro protamine suspension , an intermediate – acting blood glucose – lowering agent .
Chemically , insulin lispro is Lys ( B28 ) , Pro ( B29 ) human insulin analog , created when the amino acids at positions 28 and 29 on the insulin B – chain are reversed .
Insulin lispro is synthesized in a special non – pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli bacteria that has been genetically altered to produce insulin lispro .
Insulin lispro protamine suspension ( NPL component ) is a suspension of crystals produced from combining insulin lispro and protamine sulfate under appropriate conditions for crystal formation .
Insulin lispro has the following primary structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Insulin lispro has the empirical formula C257H383N65O77S6 and a molecular weight of 5808 , both identical to that of human insulin .
Humalog Mix75 / 25 vials and Pens contain a sterile suspension of insulin lispro protamine suspension mixed with soluble insulin lispro for use as an injection .
Each milliliter of Humalog Mix75 / 25 injection contains insulin lispro 100 units , 0 . 28 mg protamine sulfate , 16 mg glycerin , 3 . 78 mg dibasic sodium phosphate , 1 . 76 mg Metacresol , zinc oxide content adjusted to provide 0 . 025 mg zinc ion , 0 . 715 mg phenol , and Water for Injection .
Humalog Mix75 / 25 has a pH of 7 . 0 to 7 . 8 .
Hydrochloric acid 10 % and / or sodium hydroxide 10 % may have been added to adjust pH . [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Antidiabetic Activity The primary activity of insulin , including Humalog Mix75 / 25 , is the regulation of glucose metabolism .
In addition , all insulins have several anabolic and anti – catabolic actions on many tissues in the body .
In muscle and other tissues ( except the brain ) , insulin causes rapid transport of glucose and amino acids intracellularly , promotes anabolism , and inhibits protein catabolism .
In the liver , insulin promotes the uptake and storage of glucose in the form of glycogen , inhibits gluconeogenesis , and promotes the conversion of excess glucose into fat .
Insulin lispro , the rapid – acting component of Humalog Mix75 / 25 , has been shown to be equipotent to Regular human insulin on a molar basis .
One unit of Humalog ® has the same glucose – lowering effect as one unit of Regular human insulin , but its effect is more rapid and of shorter duration .
Humalog Mix75 / 25 has a similar glucose – lowering effect as compared with Humulin ® 70 / 30 on a unit for unit basis .
Pharmacokinetics Absorption Studies in nondiabetic subjects and patients with type 1 ( insulin – dependent ) diabetes demonstrated that Humalog , the rapid – acting component of Humalog Mix75 / 25 , is absorbed faster than Regular human insulin ( U – 100 ) .
In nondiabetic subjects given subcutaneous doses of Humalog ranging from 0 . 1 to 0 . 4 U / kg , peak serum concentrations were observed 30 to 90 minutes after dosing .
When nondiabetic subjects received equivalent doses of Regular human insulin , peak insulin concentrations occurred between 50 to 120 minutes after dosing .
Similar results were seen in patients with type 1 diabetes .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Humalog Mix75 / 25 has two phases of absorption .
The early phase represents insulin lispro and its distinct characteristics of rapid onset .
The late phase represents the prolonged action of insulin lispro protamine suspension .
In 30 healthy nondiabetic subjects given subcutaneous doses ( 0 . 3 U / kg ) of Humalog Mix75 / 25 , peak serum concentrations were observed 30 to 240 minutes ( median , 60 minutes ) after dosing ( see Figure 1 ) .
Identical results were found in patients with type 1 diabetes .
The rapid absorption characteristics of Humalog are maintained with Humalog Mix75 / 25 ( see Figure 1 ) .
Figure 1 represents serum insulin concentration versus time curves of Humalog Mix75 / 25 and Humulin 70 / 30 .
Humalog Mix75 / 25 has a more rapid absorption than Humulin 70 / 30 , which has been confirmed in patients with type 1 diabetes .
Distribution Radiolabeled distribution studies of Humalog Mix75 / 25 have not been conducted .
However , the volume of distribution following injection of Humalog is identical to that of Regular human insulin , with a range of 0 . 26 to 0 . 36 L / kg .
Metabolism Human metabolism studies of Humalog Mix75 / 25 have not been conducted .
Studies in animals indicate that the metabolism of Humalog , the rapid – acting component of Humalog Mix75 / 25 , is identical to that of Regular human insulin .
Elimination Humalog Mix75 / 25 has two absorption phases , a rapid and a prolonged phase , representative of the insulin lispro and insulin lispro protamine suspension components of the mixture .
As with other intermediate - acting insulins , a meaningful terminal phase half – life cannot be calculated after administration of Humalog Mix75 / 25 because of the prolonged insulin lispro protamine suspension absorption .
Pharmacodynamics Studies in nondiabetic subjects and patients with diabetes demonstrated that Humalog has a more rapid onset of glucose – lowering activity , an earlier peak for glucose – lowering , and a shorter duration of glucose – lowering activity than Regular human insulin .
The early onset of activity of Humalog Mix75 / 25 is directly related to the rapid absorption of Humalog .
The time course of action of insulin and insulin analogs , such as Humalog ( and hence Humalog Mix75 / 25 ) , may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same individual .
The parameters of Humalog Mix75 / 25 activity ( time of onset , peak time , and duration ) as presented in Figures 2 and 3 should be considered only as general guidelines .
The rate of insulin absorption and consequently the onset of activity is known to be affected by the site of injection , exercise , and other variables ( see General under PRECAUTIONS ) .
In a glucose clamp study performed in 30 nondiabetic subjects , the onset of action and glucose – lowering activity of Humalog , Humalog ® Mix50 / 50 ™ , Humalog Mix75 / 25 , and insulin lispro protamine suspension ( NPL component ) were compared ( see Figure 2 ) .
Graphs of mean glucose infusion rate versus time showed a distinct insulin activity profile for each formulation .
The rapid onset of glucose – lowering activity characteristic of Humalog was maintained in Humalog Mix75 / 25 .
In separate glucose clamp studies performed in nondiabetic subjects , pharmacodynamics of Humalog Mix75 / 25 and Humulin 70 / 30 were assessed and are presented in Figure 3 .
Humalog Mix75 / 25 has a duration of activity similar to that of Humulin 70 / 30 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Figures 2 and 3 represent insulin activity profiles as measured by glucose clamp studies in healthy nondiabetic subjects .
Figure 2 shows the time activity profiles of Humalog , Humalog Mix50 / 50 , Humalog Mix75 / 25 , and insulin lispro protamine suspension ( NPL component ) .
Figure 3 is a comparison of the time activity profiles of Humalog Mix75 / 25 ( see Figure 3 a ) and of Humulin 70 / 30 ( see Figure 3 b ) from two different studies .
Special Populations Age and Gender Information on the effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of Humalog Mix75 / 25 is unavailable .
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic comparisons between men and women administered Humalog Mix75 / 25 showed no gender differences .
In large Humalog clinical trials , sub - group analysis based on age and gender demonstrated that differences between Humalog and Regular human insulin in postprandial glucose parameters are maintained across sub - groups .
Smoking The effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Humalog Mix75 / 25 has not been studied .
Pregnancy The effect of pregnancy on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Humalog Mix75 / 25 has not been studied .
Obesity The effect of obesity and / or subcutaneous fat thickness on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Humalog Mix75 / 25 has not been studied .
In large clinical trials , which included patients with Body Mass Index up to and including 35 kg / m2 , no consistent differences were observed between Humalog and Humulin ® R with respect to postprandial glucose parameters .
Renal Impairment The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Humalog Mix75 / 25 has not been studied .
In a study of 25 patients with type 2 diabetes and a wide range of renal function , the pharmacokinetic differences between Humalog and Regular human insulin were generally maintained .
However , the sensitivity of the patients to insulin did change , with an increased response to insulin as the renal function declined .
Careful glucose monitoring and dose reductions of insulin , including Humalog Mix75 / 25 , may be necessary in patients with renal dysfunction .
Hepatic Impairment Some studies with human insulin have shown increased circulating levels of insulin in patients with hepatic failure .
The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Humalog Mix75 / 25 has not been studied .
However , in a study of 22 patients with type 2 diabetes , impaired hepatic function did not affect the subcutaneous absorption or general disposition of Humalog when compared with patients with no history of hepatic dysfunction .
In that study , Humalog maintained its more rapid absorption and elimination when compared with Regular human insulin .
Careful glucose monitoring and dose adjustments of insulin , including Humalog Mix75 / 25 , may be necessary in patients with hepatic dysfunction .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] INDICATIONS AND USAGE Humalog Mix75 / 25 , a mixture of 75 % insulin lispro protamine suspension and 25 % insulin lispro injection , ( rDNA origin ) , is indicated in the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus for the control of hyperglycemia .
Humalog Mix75 / 25 has a more rapid onset of glucose – lowering activity compared with Humulin 70 / 30 while having a similar duration of action .
This profile is achieved by combining the rapid onset of Humalog with the intermediate action of insulin lispro protamine suspension .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Humalog Mix75 / 25 is contraindicated during episodes of hypoglycemia and in patients sensitive to insulin lispro or any of the excipients contained in the formulation .
WARNINGS Humalog differs from Regular human insulin by its rapid onset of action as well as a shorter duration of activity .
Therefore , the dose of Humalog Mix75 / 25 should be given within 15 minutes before a meal .
Hypoglycemia is the most common adverse effect associated with the use of insulins , including Humalog Mix75 / 25 .
As with all insulins , the timing of hypoglycemia may differ among various insulin formulations .
Glucose monitoring is recommended for all patients with diabetes .
Any change of insulin should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision .
Changes in insulin strength , manufacturer , type ( e . g . , Regular , NPH , analog ) , species , or method of manufacture may result in the need for a change in dosage .
PRECAUTIONS General Hypoglycemia and hypokalemia are among the potential clinical adverse effects associated with the use of all insulins .
Because of differences in the action of Humalog Mix75 / 25 and other insulins , care should be taken in patients in whom such potential side effects might be clinically relevant ( e . g . , patients who are fasting , have autonomic neuropathy , or are using potassium – lowering drugs or patients taking drugs sensitive to serum potassium level ) .
Lipodystrophy and hypersensitivity are among other potential clinical adverse effects associated with the use of all insulins .
As with all insulin preparations , the time course of Humalog Mix75 / 25 action may vary in different individuals or at different times in the same individual and is dependent on site of injection , blood supply , temperature , and physical activity .
Adjustment of dosage of any insulin may be necessary if patients change their physical activity or their usual meal plan .
Insulin requirements may be altered during illness , emotional disturbances , or other stress .
Hypoglycemia — As with all insulin preparations , hypoglycemic reactions may be associated with the administration of Humalog Mix75 / 25 .
Rapid changes in serum glucose concentrations may induce symptoms of hypoglycemia in persons with diabetes , regardless of the glucose value .
Early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be different or less pronounced under certain conditions , such as long duration of diabetes , diabetic nerve disease , use of medications such as beta – blockers , or intensified diabetes control .
Renal Impairment — As with other insulins , the requirements for Humalog Mix75 / 25 may be reduced in patients with renal impairment .
Hepatic Impairment — Although impaired hepatic function does not affect the absorption or disposition of Humalog , careful glucose monitoring and dose adjustments of insulin , including Humalog Mix75 / 25 , may be necessary .
Allergy — Local Allergy — As with any insulin therapy , patients may experience redness , swelling , or itching at the site of injection .
These minor reactions usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks .
In some instances , these reactions may be related to factors other than insulin , such as irritants in the skin cleansing agent or poor injection technique .
Systemic Allergy — Less common , but potentially more serious , is generalized allergy to insulin , which may cause rash ( including pruritus ) over the whole body , shortness of breath , wheezing , reduction in blood pressure , rapid pulse , or sweating .
Severe cases of generalized allergy , including anaphylactic reaction , may be life threatening .
Localized reactions and generalized myalgias have been reported with the use of cresol as an injectable excipient .
Antibody Production — In clinical trials , antibodies that cross - react with human insulin and insulin lispro were observed in both human insulin mixtures and insulin lispro mixtures treatment groups .
Information for Patients Patients should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of Humalog Mix75 / 25 and alternative therapies .
Patients should not mix Humalog Mix75 / 25 with any other insulin .
They should also be informed about the importance of proper insulin storage , injection technique , timing of dosage , adherence to meal planning , regular physical activity , regular blood glucose monitoring , periodic hemoglobin A1c testing , recognition and management of hypo - and hyperglycemia , and periodic assessment for diabetes complications .
Patients should be advised to inform their physician if they are pregnant or intend to become pregnant .
Refer patients to the Patient Information leaflet for information on normal appearance , timing of dosing ( within 15 minutes before a meal ) , storing , and common adverse effects .
For Patients Using Insulin Pen Delivery Devices : Before starting therapy , patients should read the Patient Information leaflet that accompanies the drug product and the User Manual that accompanies the delivery device and re - read them each time the prescription is renewed .
Patients should be instructed on how to properly use the delivery device , prime the Pen to a stream of insulin , and properly dispose of needles .
Patients should be advised not to share their Pens with others .
Laboratory Tests As with all insulins , the therapeutic response to Humalog Mix75 / 25 should be monitored by periodic blood glucose tests .
Periodic measurement of hemoglobin A1c is recommended for the monitoring of long – term glycemic control .
Drug Interactions Insulin requirements may be increased by medications with hyperglycemic activity such as corticosteroids , isoniazid , certain lipid - lowering drugs ( e . g . , niacin ) , estrogens , oral contraceptives , phenothiazines , and thyroid replacement therapy .
Insulin requirements may be decreased in the presence of drugs that increase insulin sensitivity or have hypoglycemic activity , such as oral antidiabetic agents , salicylates , sulfa antibiotics , certain antidepressants ( monoamine oxidase inhibitors ) , angiotensin - converting - enzyme inhibitors , angiotensin II receptor blocking agents , beta - adrenergic blockers , inhibitors of pancreatic function ( e . g . , octreotide ) , and alcohol .
Beta – adrenergic blockers may mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia in some patients .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Humalog , Humalog Mix75 / 25 , or Humalog Mix50 / 50 .
Insulin lispro was not mutagenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity assays ( bacterial mutation tests , unscheduled DNA synthesis , mouse lymphoma assay , chromosomal aberration tests , and a micronucleus test ) .
There is no evidence from animal studies of impairment of fertility induced by insulin lispro .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects — Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies with insulin lispro have been performed in pregnant rats and rabbits at parenteral doses up to 4 and 0 . 3 times , respectively , the average human dose ( 40 units / day ) based on body surface area .
The results have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to insulin lispro .
There are , however , no adequate and well – controlled studies with Humalog , Humalog Mix75 / 25 , or Humalog Mix50 / 50 in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers It is unknown whether insulin lispro is excreted in significant amounts in human milk .
Many drugs , including human insulin , are excreted in human milk .
For this reason , caution should be exercised when Humalog Mix75 / 25 is administered to a nursing woman .
Patients with diabetes who are lactating may require adjustments in Humalog Mix75 / 25 dose , meal plan , or both .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Humalog Mix75 / 25 in patients less than 18 years of age have not been established .
Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Humalog Mix75 / 25 did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should take into consideration the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in this population .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical studies comparing Humalog Mix75 / 25 with human insulin mixtures did not demonstrate a difference in frequency of adverse events between the two treatments .
Adverse events commonly associated with human insulin therapy include the following : Body as a Whole — allergic reactions ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
Skin and Appendages — injection site reaction , lipodystrophy , pruritus , rash .
Other — hypoglycemia ( see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) .
OVERDOSAGE Hypoglycemia may occur as a result of an excess of insulin relative to food intake , energy expenditure , or both .
Mild episodes of hypoglycemia usually can be treated with oral glucose .
Adjustments in drug dosage , meal patterns , or exercise , may be needed .
More severe episodes with coma , seizure , or neurologic impairment may be treated with intramuscular / subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose .
Sustained carbohydrate intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery .
