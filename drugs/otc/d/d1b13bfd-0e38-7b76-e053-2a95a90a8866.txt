No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
10 OVERDOSAGE Colesevelam hydrochloride is not absorbed and the risk of systemic toxicity is low .
Excessive doses of colesevelam hydrochloride may cause more severe local gastrointestinal effects ( e . g . , constipation ) .
11 DESCRIPTION Colesevelam hydrochloride is a non - absorbed , polymeric , lipid - lowering agent for oral administration .
Colesevelam hydrochloride is a high - capacity bile acid - binding molecule .
Colesevelam hydrochloride is poly ( allylamine hydrochloride ) cross - linked with epichlorohydrin and alkylated with 1 - bromodecane and ( 6 - bromohexyl ) - trimethylammonium bromide .
The chemical name ( IUPAC ) of colesevelam hydrochloride is allylamine polymer with 1 - chloro - 2 , 3 - epoxypropane , [ 6 - ( allylamino ) - hexyl ] trimethylammonium chloride and N - allyldecylamine , hydrochloride .
The chemical structure of colesevelam hydrochloride is represented by the following formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] wherein ( a ) represents allyl amine monomer units that have not been alkylated by either of the 1 - bromodecane or ( 6 - bromohexyl ) - trimethylammonium bromide alkylating agents or cross - linked by epichlorohydrin ; ( b ) represents allyl amine units that have undergone cross - linking with epichlorohydrin ; ( c ) represents allyl amine units that have been alkylated with a decyl group ; ( d ) represents allyl amine units that have been alkylated with a ( 6 - trimethylammonium ) hexyl group , and m represents a number ≥ 100 to indicate an extended polymer network .
A small amount of the amines are dialkylated and are not depicted in the formula above .
No regular order of the groups is implied by the structure ; cross - linking and alkylation are expected to occur randomly along the polymer chains .
A large amount of the amines are protonated .
The polymer is depicted in the hydrochloride form ; a small amount of the halides are bromide .
Colesevelam hydrochloride is hydrophilic and insoluble in water .
Colesevelam hydrochloride tablets are off - white to light yellow , capsule shaped coated tablets each containing 625 mg colesevelam hydrochloride .
In addition , each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients : colloidal silicon dioxide , hypromellose 2910 , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose , polyethylene glycol 6000 .
The tablets are imprinted using a black ink of opacode black S - 1 - 17823 containing ferrosoferric oxide , propylene glycol and shellac .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Primary Hyperlipidemia : Colesevelam hydrochloride , the active pharmaceutical ingredient in colesevelam hydrochloride tablets , is a non - absorbed , lipid - lowering polymer that binds bile acids in the intestine , impeding their reabsorption .
As the bile acid pool becomes depleted , the hepatic enzyme , cholesterol 7 - α - hydroxylase , is upregulated , which increases the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids .
This causes an increased demand for cholesterol in the liver cells , resulting in the dual effect of increasing transcription and activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme , HMG - CoA reductase , and increasing the number of hepatic LDL receptors .
These compensatory effects result in increased clearance of LDL - C from the blood , resulting in decreased serum LDL - C levels .
Serum TG levels may increase or remain unchanged .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics A maximum therapeutic response to the lipid - lowering effects of colesevelam hydrochloride was achieved within 2 weeks and was maintained during long - term therapy .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Colesevelam hydrochloride is a hydrophilic , water - insoluble polymer that is not hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes and is not absorbed .
Distribution Colesevelam hydrochloride is not absorbed , and therefore , its distribution is limited to the gastrointestinal tract .
Elimination Metabolism Colesevelam hydrochloride is not metabolized systemically and does not interfere with systemic drug - metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 .
Excretion In 16 healthy volunteers , an average of 0 . 05 % of administered radioactivity from a single 14 C - labeled colesevelam hydrochloride dose was excreted in the urine .
Drug Interaction Studies Drug interactions between colesevelam and concomitantly administered drugs were screened through i n vitro studies and confirmed in in vivo studies .
In vitro studies demonstrated that cephalexin , metformin , and ciprofloxacin had negligible binding to colesevelam hydrochloride .
Therefore , an in vivo pharmacokinetic interaction of colesevelam hydrochloride with these drugs is unlikely .
Colesevelam hydrochloride was found to have no significant effect on the bioavailability of aspirin , atenolol , digoxin , enalapril , fenofibrate , lovastatin , metoprolol , phenytoin , pioglitazone , quinidine , rosiglitazone , sitagliptin , valproic acid , and warfarin .
The results of additional in vivo drug interactions of colesevelam hydrochloride are presented in Table 6 .

NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis A 104 - week carcinogenicity study with colesevelam hydrochloride was conducted in CD - 1 mice , at oral dietary doses up to 3 g / kg / day .
This dose was approximately 50 times the maximum recommended human dose of 4 . 5 g / day , based on body weight , mg / kg .
There were no significant drug - induced tumor findings in male or female mice .
In a 104 - week carcinogenicity study with colesevelam hydrochloride in Harlan Sprague - Dawley rats , a statistically significant increase in the incidence of pancreatic acinar cell adenoma was seen in male rats at doses > 1 . 2 g / kg / day ( approximately 20 times the maximum human dose , based on body weight , mg / kg ) ( trend test only ) .
A statistically significant increase in thyroid C - cell adenoma was seen in female rats at 2 . 4 g / kg / day ( approximately 40 times the maximum human dose , based on body weight , mg / kg ) .
Mutagenesis Colesevelam hydrochloride and 4 degradants present in the drug substance have been evaluated for mutagenicity in the Ames test and a mammalian chromosomal aberration test .
The 4 degradants and an extract of the parent compound did not exhibit genetic toxicity in an in vitro bacterial mutagenesis assay in S . typhimurium and E . coli ( Ames assay ) with or without rat liver metabolic activation .
An extract of the parent compound was positive in the Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cell chromosomal aberration assay in the presence of metabolic activation and negative in the absence of metabolic activation .
The results of the CHO cell chromosomal aberration assay with 2 of the 4 degradants , decylamine HCl and aminohexyltrimethyl ammonium chloride HCl , were equivocal in the absence of metabolic activation and negative in the presence of metabolic activation .
The other 2 degradants , didecylamine HCl and 6 - decylamino - hexyltrimethyl ammonium chloride HCl , were negative in the presence and absence of metabolic activation .
Impairment of Fertility Colesevelam hydrochloride did not impair fertility in rats at doses up to 3 g / kg / day ( approximately 50 times the maximum human dose , based on body weight , mg / kg ) .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Reproductive Toxicology Studies Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 3 g / kg / day and 1 g / kg / day , respectively ( approximately 50 and 17 times the maximum human dose , based on body weight , mg / kg ) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to colesevelam hydrochloride .

CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Primary Hyperlipidemia Colesevelam hydrochloride reduces total cholesterol ( TC ) , LDL - C , apolipoprotein B ( Apo B ) , and non - high - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( non - HDL - C ) when administered alone or in combination with a statin in patients with primary hyperlipidemia .
Approximately 1600 patients were studied in 9 clinical trials with treatment durations ranging from 4 to 50 weeks .
With the exception of one open - label , uncontrolled , long - term extension study , all studies were multicenter , randomized , double - blind , and placebo - controlled .
A maximum therapeutic response to colesevelam hydrochloride was achieved within 2 weeks and was maintained during long - term therapy .
Monotherapy In a study in patients with LDL - C between 130 mg / dL and 220 mg / dL ( mean 158 mg / dL ) , colesevelam hydrochloride was given for 24 weeks in divided doses with the morning and evening meals .
As shown in Table 7 , the mean LDL - C reductions were 15 % and 18 % at the 3 . 8 g and 4 . 5 g doses .
The respective mean TC reductions were 7 % and 10 % .
The mean Apo B reductions were 12 % in both treatment groups .
Colesevelam hydrochloride at both doses increased HDL - C by 3 % .
Increases in TG of 9 - 10 % were observed at both colesevelam hydrochloride doses , but the changes were not statistically different from placebo .

The mean LDL - C reductions were 18 % , 15 % , and 18 % for the 3 dosing regimens , respectively .
The reductions with these 3 regimens were not statistically different from one another .
Combination Therapy Co - administration of colesevelam hydrochloride and a statin ( atorvastatin , lovastatin , or simvastatin ) in 3 clinical studies demonstrated an additive reduction of LDL - C .
The mean baseline LDL - C was 184 mg / dL in the atorvastatin study ( range 156 - 236 mg / dL ) , 171 mg / dL in the lovastatin study ( range 115 - 247 mg / dL ) , and 188 mg / dL in the simvastatin study ( range 148 - 352 mg / dL ) .
As demonstrated in Table 8 , colesevelam hydrochloride doses of 2 . 3 g to 3 . 8 g resulted in an additional 8 % to 16 % reduction in LDL - C above that seen with the statin alone .

The LDL - C reduction with atorvastatin 80 mg was not statistically significantly different from the combination of colesevelam hydrochloride 3 . 8 g and atorvastatin 10 mg .
Pediatric Therapy The safety and efficacy of colesevelam hydrochloride in pediatric patients were evaluated in an 8 - week , multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel - group study followed by an open - label phase , in 194 boys and postmenarchal girls 10 - 17 years of age ( mean age 14 . 1 years ) with HeFH , taking a stable dose of an FDA - approved statin ( with LDL - C > 130 mg / dL ) or naïve to lipid - lowering therapy ( with LDL - C > 160 mg / dL ) .
This study had 3 periods : a single - blind , placebo stabilization period ; an 8 - week , randomized , double - blind , parallel - group , placebo - controlled treatment period ; and an 18 - week , open - label treatment period .
Forty - seven ( 24 % ) patients were taking statins and 147 ( 76 % ) patients were statin - naïve at screening .
The mean baseline LDL - C at Day 1 was approximately 199 mg / dL .
During the double - blind treatment period , patients were assigned randomly to treatment : colesevelam hydrochloride 3 . 8 g / day ( n = 64 ) , colesevelam hydrochloride 1 . 9 g / day ( n = 65 ) , or placebo ( n = 65 ) .
In total , 186 patients completed the double - blind treatment period .
After 8 weeks of treatment , colesevelam hydrochloride 3 . 8 g / day significantly decreased plasma levels of LDL - C , non - HDL - C , TC , and Apo B and significantly increased HDL - C .
A moderate , non - statistically significant increase in TG was observed versus placebo ( Table 9 ) .
