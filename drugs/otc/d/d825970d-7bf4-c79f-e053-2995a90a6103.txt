INDICATIONS : Multitam ™ is indicated to provide vitamin supplement to men and women .
Folic acid is effective in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to a deficiency of folic acid ( as may be seen in tropical or nontropical sprue ) and in anemias of nutritional origin , pregnancy , infancy , or childhood .
CONTRAINDICATIONS : This product is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients .
WARNING : Administration of folic acid alone is improper therapy for pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias in which vitamin B 12 is deficient .
PRECAUTIONS : Folic acid in doses above 0 . 1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia , in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive .
There is a potential danger in administering folic acid to patients with undiagnosed anemia , since folic acid may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the neurologic complications to progress .
This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made .
Adequate doses of vitamin B 12 may prevent , halt , or improve the neurologic changes caused by pernicious anemia .
The patient ’ s medical conditions and consumption of other drugs , herbs , and / or supplements should be considered .
For use on the order of a healthcare practitioner .
