Use caution in patients with congestive heart failure when replacing fluids .
If a patient develops significant vomiting or signs of dehydration including signs of orthostatic hypotension after taking PEG - 3350 , sodium chloride , sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution , consider performing post - colonoscopy lab tests ( electrolytes , creatinine , and BUN ) and treat accordingly .
Fluid and electrolyte disturbances can lead to serious adverse events including cardiac arrhythmias , seizures and renal impairment .
Fluid and electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected before treatment with PEG - 3350 , sodium chloride , sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution .
In addition , use caution when prescribing PEG - 3350 , sodium chloride , sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution for patients who have conditions , or who are using medications , that increase the risk for fluid and electrolyte disturbances or may increase the risk of adverse events of seizure , arrhythmias , and renal impairment [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 2 Cardiac Arrhythmias There have been rare reports of serious arrhythmias associated with the use of ionic osmotic laxative products for bowel preparation .
Use caution when prescribing PEG - 3350 , sodium chloride , sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution for patients at increased risk of arrhythmias ( e . g . , patients with a history of prolonged QT , uncontrolled arrhythmias , recent myocardial infarction , unstable angina , congestive heart failure , or cardiomyopathy ) .
Pre - dose and post - colonoscopy ECGs should be considered in patients at increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias .
5 . 3 Seizures There have been reports of generalized tonic - clonic seizures and / or loss of consciousness associated with use of bowel preparation products in patients with no prior history of seizures .
The seizure cases were associated with electrolyte abnormalities ( e . g . , hyponatremia , hypokalemia , hypocalcemia , and hypomagnesemia ) and low serum osmolality .
The neurologic abnormalities resolved with correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities .
Use caution when prescribing PEG - 3350 , sodium chloride , sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution for patients with a history of seizures and in patients at increased risk of seizure , such as patients taking medications that lower the seizure threshold ( e . g . , tricyclic antidepressants ) , patients withdrawing from alcohol or benzodiazepines , or patients with known or suspected hyponatremia .
5 . 4 Renal Impairment Use caution when prescribing PEG - 3350 , sodium chloride , sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution for patients with impaired renal function or patients taking concomitant medications that may affect renal function ( such as diuretics , angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors , angiotensin receptor blockers , or non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ) .
Advise these patients of the importance of adequate hydration , and consider performing baseline and post - colonoscopy laboratory tests ( electrolytes , creatinine , and BUN ) in these patients .
5 . 5 Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations and Ischemic Colitis Administration of osmotic laxative products may produce colonic mucosal aphthous ulcerations , and there have been reports of more serious cases of ischemic colitis requiring hospitalization .
Concurrent use of stimulant laxatives and PEG - 3350 , sodium chloride , sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution may increase this risk .
The potential for mucosal ulcerations resulting from the bowel preparation should be considered when interpreting colonoscopy findings in patients with known or suspect inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) .
5 . 6 Use in Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected , perform appropriate diagnostic studies to rule out these conditions before administering PEG - 3350 , sodium chloride , sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution .
If a patient experiences severe bloating , distention or abdominal pain , administration should be slowed or temporarily discontinued until the symptoms abate .
If gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation is suspected , appropriate studies should be performed to rule out these conditions before administration of PEG - 3350 , sodium chloride , sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution .
Use with caution in patients with severe active ulcerative colitis .
5 . 7 Aspiration Use with caution in patients with impaired gag reflex , unconscious , or semiconscious patients , and patients prone to regurgitation or aspiration .
Such patients should be observed during administration of PEG - 3350 , sodium chloride , sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution , especially if it is administered via nasogastric tube .
Do not combine PEG - 3350 , sodium chloride , sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution with starch - based thickeners [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) , a component of PEG - 3350 , sodium chloride , sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution , when mixed with starch - thickened liquids reduces the viscosity of the starch - thickened liquid .
When a PEG - based product used for another indication was mixed in starch - based pre - thickened liquids used in patients with dysphagia , thinning of the liquid occurred and cases of choking and potential aspiration were reported .
5 . 8 Not for Direct Ingestion The contents of each jug must be diluted with water to a final volume of 4 liters ( 4 L ) and ingestion of additional water is important to patient tolerance .
Direct ingestion of the undissolved powder may increase the risk of nausea , vomiting , dehydration , and electrolyte disturbances .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious or otherwise important adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • Serious Fluid and Serum Chemistry Abnormalities [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
• Cardiac Arrhythmias [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
• Seizures [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
• Renal Impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Colonic Mucosal Ulcerations , Ischemic Colitis and Ulcerative Colitis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Patients with Significant Gastrointestinal Disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Aspiration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] • Direct Ingestion [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] .
The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of PEG - 3350 , sodium chloride , sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Nausea , abdominal fullness and bloating are the most common adverse reactions ( occurred in up to 50 % of patients ) to administration of PEG - 3350 , sodium chloride , sodium bicarbonate and potassium chloride for oral solution .
Abdominal cramps , vomiting and anal irritation occur less frequently .
These adverse reactions are transient and usually subside rapidly .
Isolated cases of urticaria , rhinorrhea , dermatitis and ( rarely ) anaphylactic reaction have been reported which may represent allergic reactions .
Published literature contains isolated reports of serious adverse reactions following the administration of PEG - electrolyte solution products in patients over 60 years of age .
These adverse events include upper GI bleeding from Mallory - Weiss Tear , esophageal perforation , asystole , sudden dyspnea with pulmonary edema , and “ butterfly - like ” infiltrates on chest X - ray after vomiting and aspirating PEG .
Most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 3 % ) are : nausea , abdominal fullness and bloating .
Abdominal cramps , vomiting and anal irritation occur less frequently ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Affordable Pharmaceuticals , LLC at 1 - 800 - 514 - 5617 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
