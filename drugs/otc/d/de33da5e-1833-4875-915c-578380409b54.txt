RX Only DESCRIPTION Granisetron HCL tablets contain granisetron hydrochloride , an antinauseant and antiemetic agent .
Chemically it is endo - N - ( 9 - methyl - 9 - azabicyclo [ 3 . 3 . 1 ] non - 3 - yl ) - 1 - methyl - 1 H - indazole - 3 - carboxamide hydrochloride with a molecular weight of 348 . 9 ( 312 . 4 free base ) .
Its empirical formula is C18H24N4O • HCl , while its chemical structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Granisetron hydrochloride is a white to off - white solid that is readily soluble in water and normal saline at 20 ° C . Tablets for Oral Administration Each white , triangular , biconvex , film - coated Granisetron HCl Tablet contains 1 . 12 mg granisetron hydrochloride equivalent to granisetron , 1 mg .
Inactive ingredients are : hyprmellose , lactose monohydrate , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose , polyethylene glycol , polysorbate 80 , sodium starch glycolate and titanium dioxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Granisetron is a selective 5 - hydroxytryptamine3 ( 5 - HT3 ) receptor antagonist with little or no affinity for other serotonin receptors , including 5 - HT1 ; 5 - HT1A ; 5 - HT1B / C ; 5 - HT2 ; for alpha1 - , alpha2 - , or beta - adrenoreceptors ; for dopamine - D2 ; or for histamine - H1 ; benzodiazepine ; picrotoxin or opioid receptors .
Serotonin receptors of the 5 - HT3 type are located peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema .
During chemotherapy that induces vomiting , mucosal enterochromaffin cells release serotonin , which stimulates 5 - HT3 receptors .
This evokes vagal afferent discharge , inducing vomiting .
Animal studies demonstrate that , in binding to 5 - HT3 receptors , granisetron blocks serotonin stimulation and subsequent vomiting after emetogenic stimuli such as cisplatin .
In the ferret animal model , a single granisetron injection prevented vomiting due to high - dose cisplatin or arrested vomiting within 5 to 30 seconds .
In most human studies , granisetron has had little effect on blood pressure , heart rate or ECG .
No evidence of an effect on plasma prolactin or aldosterone concentrations has been found in other studies .
Following single and multiple oral doses , Granisetron HCl Tablets slowed colonic transit in normal volunteers .
However , Granisetron HCl had no effect on oro - cecal transit time in normal volunteers when given as a single intravenous ( IV ) infusion of 50 mcg / kg or 200 mcg / kg .
Pharmacokinetics In healthy volunteers and adult cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy , administration of Granisetron HCl Tablets produced mean pharmacokinetic data shown in Table 1 .
Table 1 Pharmacokinetic Parameters ( Median [ range ] ) .

Distribution Plasma protein binding is approximately 65 % and granisetron distributes freely between plasma and red blood cells .
Metabolism Granisetron metabolism involves N - demethylation and aromatic ring oxidation followed by conjugation .
In vitro liver microsomal studies show that granisetron ' s major route of metabolism is inhibited by ketoconazole , suggestive of metabolism mediated by the cytochrome P - 450 3 A subfamily .
Animal studies suggest that some of the metabolites may also have 5 - HT3 receptor antagonist activity .
Elimination Clearance is predominantly by hepatic metabolism .
In normal volunteers , approximately 11 % of the orally administered dose is eliminated unchanged in the urine in 48 hours .
The remainder of the dose is excreted as metabolites , 48 % in the urine and 38 % in the feces .
Subpopulation Gender The effects of gender on the pharmacokinetics of Granisetron HCl Tablets have not been studied .
However , after intravenous infusion of Granisetron HCl , no difference in mean AUC was found between males and females , although males had a higher Cmax generally .
In elderly and pediatric patients and in patients with renal failure or hepatic impairment , the pharmacokinetics of granisetron was determined following administration of intravenous granisetron hydrochloride .
ElderlyThe ranges of the pharmacokinetic parameters in elderly volunteers ( mean age 71 years ) , given a single 40 mcg / kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride injection , were generally similar to those in younger healthy volunteers ; mean values were lower for clearance and longer for half - life in the elderly .
Renal Failure PatientsTotal clearance of granisetron was not affected in patients with severe renal failure who received a single 40 mcg / kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride Injection .
Hepatically Impaired Patients : A pharmacokinetic study with intravenous granisetron hydrochloride in patients with hepatic impairment due to neoplastic liver involvement showed that total clearance was approximately halved compared to patients without hepatic impairment .
Given the wide variability in pharmacokinetic parameters noted in patients and the good tolerance of doses well above the recommended dose , dosage adjustment in patients with possible hepatic functional impairment is not necessary .
Pediatric Patients : A pharmacokinetic study in pediatric cancer patients ( 2 to 16 years of age ) , given a single 40 mcg / kg intravenous dose of granisetron hydrochloride Injection , showed that volume of distribution and total clearance increased with age .
No relationship with age was observed for peak plasma concentration or terminal phase plasma half - life .
When volume of distribution and total clearance are adjusted for body weight , the pharmacokinetics of granisetron are similar in pediatric and adult cancer patients .
Clinical Trials Chemotherapy - Induced Nausea and vomiting Granisetron HCl Tablets prevent nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer therapy , as shown by 24 - hour efficacy data from studies using both moderately - and highly - emetogenic chemotherapy .
Moderately Emetogenic Chemotherapy The first trial compared Granisetron HCl tablets doses of 0 . 25 mg to 2 mg bid , in 930 cancer patients receiving , principally , cyclophosphamide , carboplatin , and cisplatin ( 20 mg / m2 to 50 mg / m2 ) .
Efficacy was based on complete response ( ie , no vomiting , no moderate or severe nausea , no rescue medication ) , no vomiting , and no nausea .
Table 2 summarizes the results of this study .

Results from a Granisetron HCl Tablets 2 mg qd alone treatment arm in a third double - blind , randomized trial , were compared to prochlorperazine ( PCPZ ) , 10 mg bid , derived from a historical control .
The 24 - hour results for Granisetron HCl Tablets 2 mg qd were statistically superior to PCPZ for all efficacy parameters : complete response ( 58 % ) , no vomiting ( 79 % ) , no nausea ( 51 % ) , total control ( 49 % ) .
The PCPZ rates are shown in Table 3 .
Cisplatin - Based Chemotherapy The first double - blind trial compared Granisetron HCl Tablets 1 mg bid , relative to placebo ( historical control ) , in 119 cancer patients receiving high - dose cisplatin ( mean dose 80 mg / m2 ) .
At 24 hours , Granisetron HCl Tablets 1 mg bid was significantly ( P < 0 . 001 ) superior to placebo ( historical control ) in all efficacy parameters : complete response ( 52 % ) , no vomiting ( 56 % ) and no nausea ( 45 % ) .
The placebo rates were 7 % , 14 % , and 7 % , respectively , for the three efficacy parameters .
Results from a Granisetron HCl Tablets 2 mg qd alone treatment arm in a second double - blind , randomized trial , were compared to both Granisetron HCl Tablets 1 mg bid and placebo historical controls .
The 24 - hour results for Granisetron HCl Tablets 2 mg qd were : complete response ( 44 % ) , no vomiting ( 58 % ) , no nausea ( 46 % ) , total control ( 40 % ) .
The efficacy of Granisetron HCl Tablets 2 mg qd was comparable to Granisetron HCl Tablets 1 mg bid and statistically superior to placebo .
The placebo rates were 7 % , 14 % , 7 % , and 7 % , respectively , for the four parameters .
No controlled study comparing granisetron injection with the oral formulation to prevent chemotherapy - induced nausea and vomiting has been performed .
Radiation - Induced Nausea and Vomiting Total Body Irradiation In a double - blind randomized study , 18 patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride tablets , 2 mg daily , experienced significantly greater antiemetic protection compared to patients in a historical negative control group who received conventional ( non - 5 - HT3 antagonist ) antiemetics .
Total body irradiation consisted of 11 fractions of 120 cGy administered over 4 days , with three fractions on each of the first 3 days , and two fractions on the fourth day .
Granisetron HCl Tablets were given one hour before the first radiation fraction of each day .
Twenty - two percent ( 22 % ) of patients treated with Granisetron HCl Tablets did not experience vomiting or receive rescue antiemetics over the entire 4 - day dosing period , compared to 0 % of patients in the historical negative control group ( P < 0 . 01 ) .
In addition , patients who received Granisetron HCl Tablets also experienced significantly fewer emetic episodes during the first day of radiation and over the 4 - day treatment period , compared to patients in the historical negative control group .
The median time to the first emetic episode was 36 hours for patients who received granisetron hydrochloride tablets .
Fractionated Abdominal Radiation The efficacy of Granisetron HCl Tablets , 2 mg daily , was evaluated in a double - blind , placebo - controlled randomized trial of 260 patients .
Granisetron HCl Tablets were given 1 hour before radiation , composed of up to 20 daily fractions of 180 to 300 cGy each .
The exceptions were patients with seminoma or those receiving whole abdomen irradiation who initially received 150 cGy per fraction .
Radiation was administered to the upper abdomen with a field size of at least 100 cm2 .
The proportion of patients without emesis and those without nausea for Granisetron HCl Tablets , compared to placebo , was statistically significant ( P < 0 . 0001 ) at 24 hours after radiation , irrespective of the radiation dose .
Granisetron HCl was superior to placebo in patients receiving up to 10 daily fractions of radiation , but was not superior to placebo in patients receiving 20 fractions .
Patients treated with Granisetron HCl Tablets ( n = 134 ) had a significantly longer time to the first episode of vomiting ( 35 days vs . 9 days , P < 0 . 001 ) relative to those patients who received placebo ( n = 126 ) , and a significantly longer time to the first episode of nausea ( 11 days vs . 1 day , P < 0 . 001 ) .
Granisetron HCl provided significantly greater protection from nausea and vomiting than placebo .
INDICATIONS & USAGE Granisetron HCl is indicated for the prevention of : • Nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer therapy , including high - dose cisplatin .
• Nausea and vomiting associated with radiation , including total body irradiation and fractionated abdominal radiation .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Granisetron HCl is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components .
PRECAUTIONS Granisetron HCl is not a drug that stimulates gastric or intestinal peristalsis .
It should not be used instead of nasogastric suction .
The use of Granisetron HCl in patients following abdominal surgery or in patients with chemotherapy - induced nausea and vomiting may mask a progressive ileus and / or gastric distention .
Drug Interactions Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P - 450 drug - metabolizing enzyme system in vitro .
There have been no definitive drug - drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs ; however , in humans , Granisetron hydrochloride Injection has been safely administered with drugs representing benzodiazepines , neuroleptics , and anti - ulcer medications commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments .
Granisetron hydrochloride Injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies .
Because granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P - 450 drug - metabolizing enzymes , inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and , hence , the half - life of granisetron .
No specific interaction studies have been conducted in anesthetized patients .
In addition , the activity of the cytochrome P - 450 subfamily 3A4 ( involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents ) is not modified by granisetron hydrochloride in vitro .
In in vitro human microsomal studies , ketoconazole inhibited ring oxidation of Granisetron HCl .
However , the clinical significance of in vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known .
In a human pharmacokinetic study , hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25 % increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous Granisetron HCl .
The clinical significance of this change is not known .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment Of Fertility In a 24 - month carcinogenicity study , rats were treated orally with granisetron 1 , 5 or 50 mg / kg / day ( 6 , 30 or 300 mg / m2 / day ) .
The 50 mg / kg / day dose was reduced to 25 mg / kg / day ( 150 mg / m2 / day ) during week 59 due to toxicity .
For a 50 kg person of average height ( 1 . 46 m2 body surface area ) , these doses represent 4 , 20 , and 101 times the recommended clinical dose ( 1 . 48 mg / m2 , oral ) on a body surface area basis .
There was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas and adenomas in males treated with 5 mg / kg / day ( 30 mg / m2 / day , 20 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) and above , and in females treated with 25 mg / kg / day ( 150 mg / m2 / day , 101 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) .
No increase in liver tumors was observed at a dose of 1 mg / kg / day ( 6 mg / m2 / day , 4 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) in males and 5 mg / kg / day ( 30 mg / m2 / day , 20 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) in females .
In a 12 - month oral toxicity study , treatment with granisetron 100 mg / kg / day ( 600 mg / m2 / day , 405 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) produced hepatocellular adenomas in male and female rats while no such tumors were found in the control rats .
A 24 - month mouse carcinogenicity study of granisetron did not show a statistically significant increase in tumor incidence , but the study was not conclusive .
Because of the tumor findings in rat studies , granisetron hydrochloride should be prescribed only at the dose and for the indication recommended ( see INDICATIONS AND USAGE , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Granisetron was not mutagenic in in vitro Ames test and mouse lymphoma cell forward mutation assay , and in vivo mouse micronucleus test and in vitro and ex vivo rat hepatocyte UDS assays .
It , however , produced a significant increase in UDS in HeLa cells in vitro and a significant increased incidence of cells with polyploidy in an in vitro human lymphocyte chromosomal aberration test .
Granisetron at oral doses up to 100 mg / kg / day ( 600 mg / m2 / day , 405 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B . Reproduction studies have been performed in pregnant rats at oral doses up to 125 mg / kg / day ( 750 mg / m2 / day , 507 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) and pregnant rabbits at oral doses up to 32 mg / kg / day ( 378 mg / m2 / day , 255 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to granisetron .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether granisetron is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when Granisetron HCl is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Geriatric Use During clinical trials , 325 patients 65 years of age or older received Granisetron HCl Tablets ; 298 were 65 to 74 years of age , and 27 were 75 years of age or older .
Efficacy and safety were maintained with increasing age .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Chemotherapy - Induced Nausea and Vomiting Over 3700 patients have received Granisetron HCl Tablets in clinical trials with emetogenic cancer therapies consisting primarily of cyclophosphamide or cisplatin regimens .
In patients receiving GranisetronHCl Tablets 1 mg bid for 1 , 7 or 14 days , or 2 mg qd for 1 day , adverse experiences reported in more than 5 % of the patients with comparator and placebo incidences are listed in Table 4 .
Other adverse events reported in clinical trials were : Table 4 Principal Adverse Events in Clinical Trials Percent of Patients With Event Granisetron HCl [ 1 ] tablets 1 mg bid ( n = 978 ) Granisetron HCl null tablets 2 mg qd ( n = 1450 ) Comparator [ 2 ] ( n = 599 ) Placebo ( n = 185 ) Headache [ 3 ] 21 % 20 % 13 % 12 % Constipation 18 % 14 % 16 % 8 % Asthenia 14 % 18 % 10 % 4 % Diarrhea 8 % 9 % 10 % 4 % Abdominal pain 6 % 4 % 6 % 3 % Dyspepsia 4 % 6 % 5 % 4 % [ 1 ] Adverse events were recorded for 7 days when granisetron hydrochloride tablets were given on a single day and for up to 28 days when granisetron hydrochloride tablets were administered for 7 or 14 days .
[ 2 ] Metoclopramide / dexamethasone ; phenothiazines / dexamethasone ; dexamethasone alone ; prochlorperazine .
[ 3 ] Usually mild to moderate in severity .
Gastrointestinal : In single - day dosing studies in which adverse events were collected for 7 days , nausea ( 20 % ) and vomiting ( 12 % ) were recorded as adverse events after the 24 - hour efficacy assessment period .
Hepatic : In comparative trials , elevation of AST and ALT ( > 2 times the upper limit of normal ) following the administration of granisetron hydrochloride tablets occurred in 5 % and 6 % of patients , respectively .
These frequencies were not significantly different from those seen with comparators ( AST : 2 % ; ALT : 9 % ) .
Cardiovascular : Hypertension ( 1 % ) ; hypotension , angina pectoris , atrial fibrillation , and syncope have been observed rarely .
Central Nervous System : Dizziness ( 5 % ) , insomnia ( 5 % ) , anxiety ( 2 % ) , somnolence ( 1 % ) .
One case compatible with , but not diagnostic of , extrapyramidal symptoms have been reported in a patient treated with Granisetron HCl Tablets .
Hypersensitivity : Rare cases of hypersensitivity reactions , sometimes severe ( eg , anaphylaxis , shortness of breath , hypotension , urticaria ) have been reported .
Other : Fever ( 5 % ) .
Events often associated with chemotherapy also have been reported : leukopenia ( 9 % ) , decreased appetite ( 6 % ) , anemia ( 4 % ) , alopecia ( 3 % ) , thrombocytopenia ( 2 % ) .
Over 5000 patients have received injectable granisetron hydrochloride in clinical trials .
Table 5 gives the comparative frequencies of the five commonly reported adverse events ( ≥ 3 % ) in patients receiving granisetron hydrochloride Injection , 40 mcg / kg , in single - day chemotherapy trials .
These patients received chemotherapy , primarily cisplatin , and intravenous fluids during the 24 - hour period following granisetron hydrochloride Injection administration .
Percent of Patients with Event Granisetron hydrochloride [ 1 ] Injection 40 mcg / kg ( n = 1268 ) Comparator [ 2 ] ( n = 422 ) Headache 14 % 6 % Asthenia 5 % 6 % Somnolence 4 % 15 % Diarrhea 4 % 6 % Constipation 3 % 3 % [ 1 ] Adverse events were generally recorded over 7 days post - granisetron hydrochloride Injection administration [ 2 ] Metoclopramide / dexamethasone and phenothiazines / dexamethasone .
In the absence of a placebo group , there is uncertainty as to how many of these events should be attributed to granisetron hydrochloride , except for headache , which was clearly more frequent than in comparison groups .
Radiation - Induced Nausea and Vomiting In controlled clinical trials , the adverse events reported by patients receiving Granisetron HCl Tablets and concurrent radiation were similar to those reported by patients receiving Granisetron HCl Tablets prior to chemotherapy .
The most frequently reported adverse events were diarrhea , asthenia , and constipation .
Headache , however , was less prevalent in this patient population .
OVERDOSAGE There is no specific treatment for granisetron hydrochloride overdosage .
In case of overdosage , symptomatic treatment should be given .
Overdosage of up to 38 . 5 mg of granisetron hydrochloride injection has been reported without symptoms or only the occurrence of a slight headache .
DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Emetogenic Chemotherapy The recommended adult dosage of oral Granisetron HCl ( granisetron hydrochloride ) is 2 mg once daily or 1 mg twice daily .
