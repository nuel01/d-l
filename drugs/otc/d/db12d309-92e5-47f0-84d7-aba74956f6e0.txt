DESCRIPTION Leuprolide acetate is a synthetic nonapeptide analog of naturally occurring gonadotropin releasing hormone ( GnRH or LH - RH ) .
The analog possesses greater potency than the natural hormone .
The chemical name is 5 - oxo - L - prolyl - L - histidyl - L - tryptophyl - L - seryl - L - tyrosyl - D - leucyl - L - leucyl - L - arginyl - N - ethyl - L - prolinamide acetate ( salt ) with the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION is a sterile , aqueous solution intended for subcutaneous injection .
It is available in a 2 . 8 mL multiple - dose vial containing leuprolide acetate ( 5 mg / mL ) , sodium chloride , USP ( 6 . 3 mg / mL ) for tonicity adjustment , benzyl alcohol , NF as a preservative ( 9 mg / mL ) , and water for injection , USP .
The pH may have been adjusted with sodium hydroxide , NF and / or acetic acid , NF .
The pH range is 4 . 0 to 6 . 0 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Leuprolide acetate , an LH - RH agonist , acts as a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion when given continuously and in therapeutic doses .
Animal and human studies indicate that following an initial stimulation of gonadotropins , chronic administration of leuprolide acetate results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis .
This effect is reversible upon discontinuation of drug therapy .
Administration of leuprolide acetate has resulted in inhibition of the growth of certain hormone dependent tumors ( prostatic tumors in Noble and Dunning male rats and DMBA - induced mammary tumors in female rats ) as well as atrophy of the reproductive organs .
In humans , subcutaneous administration of single daily doses of leuprolide acetate results in an initial increase in circulating levels of luteinizing hormone ( LH ) and follicle stimulating hormone ( FSH ) leading to a transient increase in levels of the gonadal steroids ( testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in males , and estrone and estradiol in pre - menopausal females ) .
However , continuous daily administration of leuprolide acetate results in decreased levels of LH and FSH .
In males , testosterone is reduced to castrate levels .
In pre - menopausal females , estrogens are reduced to post - menopausal levels .
These decreases occur within two to four weeks after initiation of treatment , and castrate levels of testosterone in prostatic cancer patients have been demonstrated for periods of up to five years .
Leuprolide acetate is not active when given orally .
Pharmacokinetics Absorption Bioavailability by subcutaneous administration is comparable to that by intravenous administration .
Distribution The mean steady - state volume of distribution of leuprolide following intravenous bolus administration to healthy male volunteers was 27 L .
In vitro binding to human plasma proteins ranged from 43 % to 49 % .
Metabolism In healthy male volunteers , a 1 mg bolus of leuprolide administered intravenously revealed that the mean systemic clearance was 7 . 6 L / h , with a terminal elimination half - life of approximately 3 hours based on a two compartment model .
In rats and dogs , administration of 14 C - labeled leuprolide was shown to be metabolized to smaller inactive peptides , a pentapeptide ( Metabolite I ) , tripeptides ( Metabolites II and III ) and a dipeptide ( Metabolite IV ) .
These fragments may be further catabolized .
The major metabolite ( M - I ) plasma concentrations measured in 5 prostate cancer patients reached maximum concentration 2 to 6 hours after dosing and were approximately 6 % of the peak parent drug concentration .
One week after dosing , mean plasma M - I concentrations were approximately 20 % of mean leuprolide concentrations .
Excretion Following administration of LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION 3 . 75 mg to 3 patients , less than 5 % of the dose was recovered as parent and M - I metabolite in the urine .
Special Populations The pharmacokinetics of the drug in hepatically and renally impaired patients have not been determined .
Drug Interactions No pharmacokinetic - based drug - drug interaction studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate .
However , because leuprolide acetate is a peptide that is primarily degraded by peptidase and not by cytochrome P - 450 enzymes as noted in specific studies , and the drug is only about 46 % bound to plasma proteins , drug interactions would not be expected to occur .
CLINICAL STUDIES In a controlled study comparing LEUPROLIDE ACETATE 1 mg / day given subcutaneously to DES ( diethylstilbestrol ) , 3 mg / day , the survival rate for the two groups was comparable after two years of treatment .
The objective response to treatment was also similar for the two groups .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION is indicated in the palliative treatment of advanced prostatic cancer .
CONTRAINDICATIONS • LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to GnRH , GnRH agonist analogs , or any of the excipients in LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION : Reports of anaphylactic reactions to synthetic GnRH or GnRH agonist analogs have been reported in the medical literature . 1 • LEUPROLIDE ACETATE is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant while receiving the drug .
LEUPROLIDE ACETATE may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Therefore , the possibility exists that spontaneous abortion may occur if the drug is administered during pregnancy .
If this drug is administered during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking any formulation of LEUPROLIDE ACETATE , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus .
WARNINGS Initially , LEUPROLIDE ACETATE , like other LH - RH agonists , causes increases in serum levels of testosterone .
Transient worsening of symptoms , or the occurrence of additional signs and symptoms of prostate cancer , may occasionally develop during the first few weeks of LEUPROLIDE ACETATE treatment .
A small number of patients may experience a temporary increase in bone pain , which can be managed symptomatically .
As with other LH - RH agonists , isolated cases of ureteral obstruction and spinal cord compression have been observed , which may contribute to paralysis with or without fatal complications .
Safe use of leuprolide acetate in pregnancy has not been established clinically .
Before starting treatment with LEUPROLIDE ACETATE , pregnancy must be excluded ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS section ) .
Periodic monitoring of serum testosterone and prostate - specific antigen ( PSA ) levels is recommended , especially if the anticipated clinical or biochemical response to treatment has not been achieved .
It should be noted that results of testosterone determinations are dependent on assay methodology .
It is advisable to be aware of the type and precision of the assay methodology to make appropriate clinical and therapeutic decisions .
PRECAUTIONS Patients with metastatic vertebral lesions and / or with urinary tract obstruction should be closely observed during the first few weeks of therapy ( see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS sections ) .
Patients with known allergies to benzyl alcohol , an ingredient of the drug ’ s vehicle , may present symptoms of hypersensitivity , usually local , in the form of erythema and induration at the injection site .
Information for Patients See INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS which appears after the REFERENCE section .
Laboratory Tests Response to leuprolide acetate should be monitored by measuring serum levels of testosterone and prostate - specific antigen ( PSA ) .
In the majority of patients , testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week , declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment .
Castrate levels were reached within two to four weeks and once attained were maintained for as long as drug administration continued .
Drug Interactions See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Pharmacokinetics section .
Drug / Laboratory Test Interactions Administration of leuprolide acetate in therapeutic doses results in suppression of the pituitary - gonadal system .
Normal function is usually restored within 4 to 12 weeks after treatment is discontinued .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Two - year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in rats and mice .
In rats , a dose - related increase of benign pituitary hyperplasia and benign pituitary adenomas was noted at 24 months when the drug was administered subcutaneously at high daily doses ( 0 . 6 to 4 mg / kg ) .
There was a significant but not dose - related increase of pancreatic islet cell adenomas in females and of testicular interstitial cell adenomas in males ( highest incidence in the low dose group ) .
In mice no pituitary abnormalities were observed at a dose as high as 60 mg / kg for two years .
Patients have been treated with leuprolide acetate for up to three years with doses as high as 10 mg / day and for two years with doses as high as 20 mg / day without demonstrable pituitary abnormalities .
Mutagenicity studies have been performed with leuprolide acetate using bacterial and mammalian systems .
These studies provided no evidence of a mutagenic potential .
Clinical and pharmacologic studies in adults ( ≥ 18 years ) with leuprolide acetate and similar analogs have shown full reversibility of fertility suppression when the drug is discontinued after continuous administration for periods of up to 24 weeks .
However , no clinical studies have been conducted with leuprolide acetate to assess the reversibility of fertility suppression .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category X ( See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS sections . )
When administered on day 6 of pregnancy at test dosages of 0 . 00024 , 0 . 0024 , and 0 . 024 mg / kg ( 1 / 600 to 1 / 6 the human dose ) to rabbits , LEUPROLIDE ACETATE produced a dose - related increase in major fetal abnormalities .
Similar studies in rats failed to demonstrate an increase in major fetal malformations throughout gestation .
There was increased fetal mortality and decreased fetal weights with the two higher doses of LEUPROLIDE ACETATE in rabbits and with the highest dose in rats .
The effects on fetal mortality are expected consequences of the alterations in hormonal levels brought about by this drug .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether leuprolide acetate is excreted in human milk .
LEUPROLIDE ACETATE should not be used by nursing mothers .
Geriatric Use In the clinical trials for LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION , the majority ( 69 % ) of subjects studied were at least 65 years of age .
Therefore , the labeling reflects the pharmacokinetics , efficacy , and safety of LEUPROLIDE ACETATE in this population .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials In the majority of patients testosterone levels increased above baseline during the first week , declining thereafter to baseline levels or below by the end of the second week of treatment .
This transient increase was occasionally associated with a temporary worsening of signs and symptoms , usually manifested by an increase in bone pain ( see WARNINGS section ) .
In a few cases a temporary worsening of existing hematuria and urinary tract obstruction occurred during the first week .
Temporary weakness and paresthesia of the lower limbs have been reported in a few cases .
Potential exacerbations of signs and symptoms during the first few weeks of treatment is a concern in patients with vertebral metastases and / or urinary obstruction which , if aggravated , may lead to neurological problems or increase the obstruction .
In a comparative trial of LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION versus DES , in 5 % or more of the patients receiving either drug , the following adverse reactions were reported to have a possible or probable relationship to drug as ascribed by the treating physician .
Often , causality is difficult to assess in patients with metastatic prostate cancer .
Reactions considered not drug related are excluded .

Postmarketing During postmarketing surveillance , which includes other dosage forms and other patient populations , the following adverse events were reported .
Symptoms consistent with an anaphylactoid or asthmatic process have been rarely ( incidence rate of about 0 . 002 % ) reported .
Rash , urticaria , and photosensitivity reactions have also been reported .
Localized reactions , including induration and abscess , have been reported at the site of injection .
Symptoms consistent with fibromyalgia ( e . g . , joint and muscle pain , headaches , sleep disorders , gastrointestinal distress , and shortness of breath ) have been reported individually and collectively .

Changes in Bone Density Decreased bone density has been reported in the medical literature in men who have had orchiectomy or who have been treated with an LH - RH agonist analog .
In a clinical trial , 25 men with prostate cancer , 12 of whom had been treated previously with leuprolide acetate for at least six months , underwent bone density studies as a result of pain .
The leuprolide - treated group had lower bone density scores than the nontreated control group .
It can be anticipated that long periods of medical castration in men will have effects on bone density .
Pituitary Apoplexy During post - marketing surveillance , rare cases of pituitary apoplexy ( a clinical syndrome secondary to infarction of the pituitary gland ) have been reported after the administration of gonadotropin - releasing hormone agonists .
In a majority of these cases , a pituitary adenoma was diagnosed , with a majority of pituitary apoplexy cases occurring within 2 weeks of the first dose , and some within the first hour .
In these cases , pituitary apoplexy has presented as sudden headache , vomiting , visual changes , ophthalmoplegia , altered mental status , and sometimes cardiovascular collapse .
Immediate medical attention has been required .
See other LEUPROLIDE ACETATE FOR DEPOT SUSPENSION and LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION package inserts for other events reported in the same and different patient populations .
OVERDOSAGE In rats subcutaneous administration of 250 to 500 times the recommended human dose , expressed on a per body weight basis , resulted in dyspnea , decreased activity , and local irritation at the injection site .
There is no evidence at present that there is a clinical counterpart of this phenomenon .
In early clinical trials with leuprolide acetate doses as high as 20 mg / day for up to two years caused no adverse effects differing from those observed with the 1 mg / day dose .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dose is 1 mg ( 0 . 2 mL or 20 unit mark ) administered as a single daily subcutaneous injection .
As with other drugs administered chronically by subcutaneous injection , the injection site should be varied periodically .
Each 0 . 2 mL contains 1 mg of leuprolide acetate , sodium chloride for tonicity adjustment , 1 . 8 mg of benzyl alcohol as preservative and water for injection .
The pH may have been adjusted with sodium hydroxide and / or acetic acid .

INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Be sure to consult your physician with any questions you may have or for information about LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION and its use .
WHAT IS LEUPROLIDE ACETATE ?
LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION is chemically similar to gonadotropin releasing hormone ( GnRH or LH - RH ) a hormone which occurs naturally in your body .
Normally , your body releases small amounts of LH - RH and this leads to events which stimulate the production of sex hormones .
However , when you inject LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION , the normal events that lead to sex hormone production are interrupted and testosterone is no longer produced by the testes .
LEUPROLIDE ACETATE must be injected because , like insulin which is injected by diabetics , LEUPROLIDE ACETATE is inactive when taken by mouth .
If you were to discontinue the drug for any reason , your body would begin making testosterone again .
DIRECTIONS FOR USING LEUPROLIDE ACETATE • Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water .
• If using a new bottle for the first time , flip off the plastic cover to expose the grey rubber stopper .
Wipe metal ring and rubber stopper with an alcohol wipe each time you use LEUPROLIDE ACETATE .
Check the liquid in the container .
If it is not clear or has particles in it , DO NOT USE IT .
Exchange it at your pharmacy for another container .
• Remove outer wrapping from one syringe .
Pull plunger back until the tip of the plunger is at the 0 . 2 mL or 20 - unit mark .
• Take cover off needle .
Push the needle through the center of the rubber stopper on the LEUPROLIDE ACETATE bottle .
• Push the plunger all the way in to inject air into the bottle .
• Keep the needle in the bottle and turn the bottle upside down .
Check to make sure the tip of the needle is in the liquid .
Slowly pull back on the plunger , until the syringe fills to the 0 . 2 mL or 20 - unit mark .
• Toward the end of a two - week period , the amount of LEUPROLIDE ACETATE left in the bottle will be small .
Take special care to hold the bottle straight and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger .
• Keeping the needle in the bottle and the bottle upside down , check for air bubbles in the syringe .
If you see any , push the plunger slowly in to push the air bubble back into the bottle .
Keep the tip of the needle in the liquid and pull the plunger back again to fill to the 0 . 2 mL or 20 - unit mark .
• Do this again if necessary to eliminate air bubbles .
• To protect your skin , inject each daily dose at a different body spot .
• Choose an injection spot .
Cleanse the injection spot with another alcohol wipe .
• Hold the syringe in one hand .
Hold the skin taut , or pull up a little flesh with the other hand , as you were instructed .
• Holding the syringe as you would a pencil , thrust the needle all the way into the skin at a 90 ° angle .
Push the plunger to administer the injection .
• Hold an alcohol wipe down on your skin where the needle is inserted and withdraw the needle at the same angle it was inserted .
• Use the disposable syringe only once and dispose of it properly as you were instructed .
Needles thrown into a garbage bag could accidentally stick someone .
NEVER LEAVE SYRINGES , NEEDLES OR DRUGS WHERE CHILDREN CAN REACH THEM .
SOME SPECIAL ADVICE • You may experience hot flashes when using LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION .
During the first few weeks of treatment you may experience increased bone pain , increased difficulty in urinating , and less commonly but most importantly , you may experience the onset or aggravation of nerve symptoms .
In any of these events , discuss the symptoms with your doctor .
Like other treatment options , LEUPROLIDE ACETATE may cause impotence .
Notify your doctor if you develop new or worsened symptoms after beginning LEUPROLIDE ACETATE treatment .
• You may experience some irritation at the injection site , such as burning , itching or swelling .
These reactions are usually mild and go away .
If they do not , tell your doctor .
• If you have experienced an allergic reaction to other drugs like LEUPROLIDE ACETATE , you should not use this drug .
• Do not stop taking your injections because you feel better .
You need an injection every day to make sure LEUPROLIDE ACETATE keeps working for you .
• If you need to use an alternate to the syringe supplied with LEUPROLIDE ACETATE INJECTION , low - dose insulin syringes should be utilized .
• When the drug level gets low , take special care to hold the bottle straight up and down and to keep the needle tip in liquid while pulling back on the plunger .
• Do not try to get every last drop out of the bottle .
This will increase the possibility of drawing air into the syringe and getting an incomplete dose .
Some extra drug has been provided so that you can withdraw the recommended number of doses .
• Tell your pharmacist when you will need LEUPROLIDE ACETATE so it will be at the pharmacy when you need it .
• Store below 77 ° F ( 25 ° C ) .
Do not store near a radiator or other very warm place .
Do not freeze .
Protect from light ; store vial in carton until use .
• Do not leave your drug or hypodermic syringes where anyone can pick them up .
• Keep this and all other medications out of reach of children .
