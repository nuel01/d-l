Keep tightly closed .
After mixing , store suspension at 5 ° to 30 ° C ( 41 ° to 86 ° F ) and use within 10 days .
Discard after full dosing is completed .
Azithromycin for oral suspension USP after constitution contains a banana - cherry flavored suspension .
Azithromycin for oral suspension USP is supplied to provide 100 mg / 5 mL or 200 mg / 5 mL suspension in bottles .
4 . 1 Hypersensitivity Azithromycin for oral suspension is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to azithromycin , erythromycin , any macrolide or ketolide drug .
4 . 2 Hepatic Dysfunction Azithromycin for oral suspension is contraindicated in patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice / hepatic dysfunction associated with prior use of azithromycin .
5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Serious allergic reactions , including angioedema , anaphylaxis , and dermatologic reactions including Stevens - Johnson syndrome , and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients on azithromycin therapy .
[ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 . 1 ) ] Fatalities have been reported .
Cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms ( DRESS ) have also been reported .
Despite initially successful symptomatic treatment of the allergic symptoms , when symptomatic therapy was discontinued , the allergic symptoms recurred soon thereafter in some patients without further azithromycin exposure .
These patients required prolonged periods of observation and symptomatic treatment .
The relationship of these episodes to the long tissue half - life of azithromycin and subsequent prolonged exposure to antigen is presently unknown .
If an allergic reaction occurs , the drug should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be instituted .
Physicians should be aware that allergic symptoms may reappear when symptomatic therapy has been discontinued .
5 . 2 Hepatotoxicity Abnormal liver function , hepatitis , cholestatic jaundice , hepatic necrosis , and hepatic failure have been reported , some of which have resulted in death .
Discontinue azithromycin immediately if signs and symptoms of hepatitis occur .
5 . 3 Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis ( IHPS ) Following the use of azithromycin in neonates ( treatment up to 42 days of life ) , IHPS has been reported .
Direct parents and caregivers to contact their physician if vomiting or irritability with feeding occurs .
5 . 4 QT Prolongation Prolonged cardiac repolarization and QT interval , imparting a risk of developing cardiac arrhythmia and torsades de pointes , have been seen with treatment with macrolides , including azithromycin .
Cases of torsades de pointes have been spontaneously reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients receiving azithromycin .
Providers should consider the risk of QT prolongation which can be fatal when weighing the risks and benefits of azithromycin for at - risk groups including : • patients with known prolongation of the QT interval , a history of torsades de pointes , congenital long QT syndrome , bradyarrhythmias or uncompensated heart failure • patients on drugs known to prolong the QT interval • patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions such as uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia , clinically significant bradycardia , and in patients receiving Class IA ( quinidine , procainamide ) or Class III ( dofetilide , amiodarone , sotalol ) antiarrhythmic agents .
Elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug - associated effects on the QT interval .
5 . 5 Clostridium difficile - Associated Diarrhea ( CDAD ) Clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including azithromycin , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon , leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficileproduces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficilecause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibiotic treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
5 . 6 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of myasthenic syndrome have been reported in patients receiving azithromycin therapy .
5 . 7 Use in Sexually Transmitted Infections Azithromycin , at the recommended dose , should not be relied upon to treat syphilis .
Antibacterial agents used to treat non - gonococcal urethritis may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating syphilis .
All patients with sexually transmitted urethritis or cervicitis should have a serologic test for syphilis and appropriate testing for gonorrhea performed at the time of diagnosis .
Appropriate antibacterial therapy and follow - up tests for these diseases should be initiated if infection is confirmed .
5 . 8 Development of Drug - Resistant Bacteria Prescribing azithromycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In clinical trials , most of the reported side effects were mild to moderate in severity and were reversible upon discontinuation of the drug .
Potentially serious adverse reactions of angioedema and cholestatic jaundice were reported .
Approximately 0 . 7 % of the patients ( adults and pediatric patients ) from the 5 - day multiple - dose clinical trials discontinued azithromycin therapy because of treatment - related adverse reactions .
In adults given 500 mg / day for 3 days , the discontinuation rate due to treatment - related adverse reactions was 0 . 6 % .
In clinical trials in pediatric patients given 30 mg / kg , either as a single dose or over 3 days , discontinuation from the trials due to treatment - related adverse reactions was approximately 1 % .
Most of the adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were related to the gastrointestinal tract , e . g . , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , or abdominal pain .
[ see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14 . 2 ) ] 6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of azithromycin .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Adverse reactions reported with azithromycin during the postmarketing period in adult and / or pediatric patients for which a causal relationship may not be established include : Allergic : Arthralgia , edema , urticaria , and angioedema .
Cardiovascular : Arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia and hypotension .
There have been reports of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes .
Gastrointestinal : Anorexia , constipation , dyspepsia , flatulence , vomiting / diarrhea , pseudomembranous colitis , pancreatitis , oral candidiasis , pyloric stenosis , and reports of tongue discoloration .
General : Asthenia , paresthesia , fatigue , malaise , and anaphylaxis Genitourinary : Interstitial nephritis and acute renal failure and vaginitis .
Hematopoietic : Thrombocytopenia .
Liver / Biliary : Abnormal liver function , hepatitis , cholestatic jaundice , hepatic necrosis , and hepatic failure .
[ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 2 ) ] Nervous System : Convulsions , dizziness / vertigo , headache , somnolence , hyperactivity , nervousness , agitation , and syncope .
Psychiatric : Aggressive reaction and anxiety .
Skin / Appendages : Pruritus serious skin reactions including erythema multiforme , Stevens - Johnson Syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis , and DRESS .
Special Senses : Hearing disturbances including hearing loss , deafness and / or tinnitus , and reports of taste / smell perversion and / or loss .
6 . 3 Laboratory Abnormalities Adults : Clinically significant abnormalities ( irrespective of drug relationship ) occurring during the clinical trials were reported as follows : with an incidence of greater than 1 % : decreased hemoglobin , hematocrit , lymphocytes , neutrophils , and blood glucose ; elevated serum creatine phosphokinase , potassium , ALT , GGT , AST , BUN , creatinine , blood glucose , platelet count , lymphocytes , neutrophils , and eosinophils ; with an incidence of less than 1 % : leukopenia , neutropenia , decreased sodium , potassium , platelet count , elevated monocytes , basophils , bicarbonate , serum alkaline phosphatase , bilirubin , LDH , and phosphate .
The majority of subjects with elevated serum creatinine also had abnormal values at baseline .
When follow - up was provided , changes in laboratory tests appeared to be reversible .
In multiple - dose clinical trials involving more than 5000 patients , four patients discontinued therapy because of treatment - related liver enzyme abnormalities and one because of a renal function abnormality .
Pediatric Patients : One , Three , and Five - Day Regimens Laboratory data collected from comparative clinical trials employing two 3 - day regimens ( 30 mg / kg or 60 mg / kg in divided doses over 3 days ) , or two 5 - day regimens ( 30 mg / kg or 60 mg / kg in divided doses over 5 days ) were similar for regimens of azithromycin and all comparators combined , with most clinically significant laboratory abnormalities occurring at incidences of 1 - 5 % .
Laboratory data for patients receiving 30 mg / kg as a single dose were collected in one single center trial .
In that trial , an absolute neutrophil count between 500 - 1500 cells / mm3 was observed in 10 / 64 patients receiving 30 mg / kg as a single dose , 9 / 62 patients receiving 30 mg / kg given over 3 days , and 8 / 63 comparator patients .
No patient had an absolute neutrophil count < 500 cells / mm3 .
In multiple - dose clinical trials involving approximately 4700 pediatric patients , no patients discontinued therapy because of treatment - related laboratory abnormalities .
7 . 1 Nelfinavir Co - administration of nelfinavir at steady - state with a single oral dose of azithromycin resulted in increased azithromycin serum concentrations .
Although a dose adjustment of azithromycin is not recommended when administered in combination with nelfinavir , close monitoring for known adverse reactions of azithromycin , such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment , is warranted .
[ see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 ) ] 7 . 2 Warfarin Spontaneous postmarketing reports suggest that concomitant administration of azithromycin may potentiate the effects of oral anticoagulants such as warfarin , although the prothrombin time was not affected in the dedicated drug interaction study with azithromycin and warfarin .
Prothrombin times should be carefully monitored while patients are receiving azithromycin and oral anticoagulants concomitantly .
7 . 3 Potential Drug - Drug Interaction with Macrolides Interactions with digoxin , colchicine or phenytoin have not been reported in clinical trials with azithromycin .
No specific drug interaction studies have been performed to evaluate potential drug - drug interaction .
However , drug interactions have been observed with other macrolide products .
Until further data are developed regarding drug interactions when digoxin or phenytoin are used with azithromycin careful monitoring of patients is advised .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature and postmarketing experience over several decades with azithromycin use in pregnant women have not identified any drug - associated risks for major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ) .
Developmental toxicity studies with azithromycin in rats , mice , and rabbits showed no drug - induced fetal malformations at doses up to 4 , 2 , and 2 times , respectively , an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area .
Decreased viability and delayed development were observed in the offspring of pregnant rats administered azithromycin from day 6 of pregnancy through weaning at a dose equivalent to 4 times an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data Available data from published observational studies , case series , and case reports over several decades do not suggest an increased risk for major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes with azithromycin use in pregnant women .
Limitations of these data include the lack of randomization and inability to control for confounders such as underlying maternal disease and maternal use of concomitant medications .
Animal Data Azithromycin administered during the period of organogenesis did not cause fetal malformations in rats and mice at oral doses up to 200 mg / kg / day ( moderately maternally toxic ) .
Based on body surface area , this dose is approximately 4 ( rats ) and 2 ( mice ) times an adult human daily dose of 500 mg .
In rabbits administered azithromycin at oral doses of 10 , 20 , and 40 mg / kg / day during organogenesis , reduced maternal body weight and food consumption were observed in all groups ; no evidence of fetotoxicity or teratogenicity was observed at these doses , the highest of which is estimated to be 2 times an adult human daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area .
In a pre - and postnatal development study , azithromycin was administered orally to pregnant rats from day 6 of pregnancy until weaning at doses of 50 or 200 mg / kg / day .
Maternal toxicity ( reduced food consumption and body weight gain ; increased stress at parturition ) was observed at the higher dose .
Effects in the offspring were noted at 200 mg / kg / day during the postnatal development period ( decreased viability , delayed developmental landmarks ) .
These effects were not observed in a pre - and postnatal rat study when up to 200 mg / kg / day of azithromycin was given orally beginning on day 15 of pregnancy until weaning .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Azithromycin is present in human milk ( see Data ) .
Non - serious adverse reactions have been reported in breastfed infants after maternal administration of azithromycin ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
There are no available data on the effects of azithromycin on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for azithromycin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azithromycin or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations Advise women to monitor the breastfed infant for diarrhea , vomiting , or rash .
Data Azithromycin breastmilk concentrations were measured in 20 women after receiving a single 2 g oral dose of azithromycin during labor .
Breastmilk samples collected on days 3 and 6 postpartum as well as 2 and 4 weeks postpartum revealed the presence of azithromycin in breastmilk up to 4 weeks after dosing .
In another study , a single dose of azithromycin 500 mg was administered intravenously to 8 women prior to incision for cesarean section .
Breastmilk ( colostrum ) samples obtained between 12 and 48 hours after dosing revealed that azithromycin persisted in breastmilk up to 48 hours .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) , INDICATIONS AND USAGE ( 1 . 2 ) , and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 2 ) ] Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with acute otitis media , acute bacterial sinusitis and community - acquired pneumonia under 6 months of age have not been established .
Use of azithromycin for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and community - acquired pneumonia in pediatric patients ( 6 months of age or greater ) is supported by adequate and well - controlled trials in adults .
Pharyngitis / Tonsillitis : Safety and effectiveness in the treatment of pediatric patients with pharyngitis / tonsillitis under 2 years of age have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In multiple - dose clinical trials of oral azithromycin , 9 % of patients were at least 65 years of age ( 458 / 4949 ) and 3 % of patients ( 144 / 4949 ) were at least 75 years of age .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
Elderly patients may be more susceptible to development of torsades de pointes arrhythmias than younger patients .
[ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 4 ) ] Adverse reactions experienced at higher than recommended doses were similar to those seen at normal doses particularly nausea , diarrhea , and vomiting .
In the event of overdosage , general symptomatic and supportive measures are indicated as required .
Azithromycin for oral suspension USP contains the active ingredient azithromycin monohydrate , USP , a macrolide antibacterial drug , for oral administration .
Azithromycin has the chemical name ( 2 R , 3 S , 4 R , 5 R , 8 R , 10 R , 11 R , 12 S , 13 S , 14 R ) - 13 - [ ( 2 , 6 - dideoxy - 3 - C - methyl - 3 - O - methyl - α - L - ribo - hexopyranosyl ) oxy ] - 2 - ethyl - 3 , 4 , 10 - trihydroxy - 3 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 - heptamethyl - 11 - [ [ 3 , 4 , 6 - trideoxy - 3 - ( dimethylamino ) - β - D - xylo - hexopyranosyl ] oxy ] - 1 - oxa - 6 - azacyclopentadecan - 15 - one monohydrate .
Azithromycin is derived from erythromycin ; however , it differs chemically from erythromycin in that a methyl - substituted nitrogen atom is incorporated into the lactone ring .
Its molecular formula is C38H72N2O12 ∙ H2O , and its molecular weight is 767 . 00 .
Azithromycin has the following structural formula : [ structural - formula ] Azithromycin , USP , as the monohydrate , is a white to off - white crystalline powder with a molecular formula of C38H72N2O12 • H2O and a molecular weight of 767 . 00 .
Azithromycin for Oral Suspension USP is supplied in bottles containing azithromycin monohydrate powder equivalent to 300 mg , 600 mg , 900 mg , or 1200 mg azithromycin , USP per bottle and the following inactive ingredients : colloidal silicon dioxide , FD & C Red No . 40 Aluminum Lake , hydroxypropyl cellulose , sodium phosphate tribasic anhydrous , sucrose , natural and artificial banana flavor , natural and artificial cherry flavor and xanthan gum .
After constitution , each 5 mL of suspension contains 100 mg or 200 mg of azithromycin , USP .
The dry powder before constitution is off - white to pinkish in color .
The suspension after constitution is pink to red in color .
12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug .
[ see MICROBIOLOGY ( 12 . 4 ) ] 12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Based on animal models of infection , the antibacterial activity of azithromycin appears to correlate with the ratio of area under the concentration - time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration ( AUC / MIC ) for certain pathogens ( S . pneumoniae and S . aureus ) .
The principal pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic parameter best associated with clinical and microbiological cure has not been elucidated in clinical trials with azithromycin .
Cardiac Electrophysiology QTc interval prolongation was studied in a randomized , placebo - controlled parallel trial in 116 healthy subjects who received either chloroquine ( 1000 mg ) alone or in combination with oral azithromycin ( 500 mg , 1000 mg , and 1500 mg once daily ) .
Co - administration of azithromycin increased the QTc interval in a dose - and concentration - dependent manner .
In comparison to chloroquine alone , the maximum mean ( 95 % upper confidence bound ) increases in QTcF were 5 ( 10 ) ms , 7 ( 12 ) ms and 9 ( 14 ) ms with the co - administration of 500 mg , 1000 mg and 1500 mg azithromycin , respectively .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following oral administration of a single 500 mg dose ( two 250 mg tablets ) to 36 fasted healthy male volunteers , the mean ( SD ) pharmacokinetic parameters were AUC0 - 72 = 4 . 3 ( 1 . 2 ) mcg ∙ hr / mL ; Cmax = 0 . 5 ( 0 . 2 ) mcg / mL ; Tmax = 2 . 2 ( 0 . 9 ) hours .
Two azithromycin 250 mg tablets are bioequivalent to a single 500 mg tablet .
In a two - way crossover study , 12 adult healthy volunteers ( 6 males , 6 females ) received 1500 mg of azithromycin administered in single daily doses over either 5 days ( two 250 mg tablets on day 1 , followed by one 250 mg tablet on days 2 to 5 ) or 3 days ( 500 mg per day for days 1 to 3 ) .
Due to limited serum samples on day 2 ( 3 day regimen ) and days 2 to 4 ( 5 day regimen ) , the serum concentration - time profile of each subject was fit to a 3 - compartment model and the AUC0 - ∞ for the fitted concentration profile was comparable between the 5 day and 3 day regimens .
3 - Day Regimen 5 - Day Regimen Pharmacokinetic Parameter [ mean ( SD ) ] Day 1 Day 3 Day 1 Day 5 Cmax ( serum , mcg / mL ) 0 . 44 ( 0 . 22 ) 0 . 54 ( 0 . 25 ) 0 . 43 ( 0 . 20 ) 0 . 24 ( 0 . 06 ) Serum AUC0 - ∞ ( mcg ∙ hr / mL ) 17 . 4 ( 6 . 2 ) * 14 . 9 ( 3 . 1 ) * Serum T ½ 71 . 8 hr 68 . 9 hr * Total AUC for the entire 3 - day and 5 day regimens .
Absorption The absolute bioavailability of azithromycin 250 mg capsules is 38 % .
In a two - way crossover study in which 12 healthy subjects received a single 500 mg dose of azithromycin ( two 250 mg tablets ) with or without a high fat meal , food was shown to increase Cmax by 23 % but had no effect on AUC .
When azithromycin oral suspension was administered with food to 28 adult healthy male subjects , Cmax increased by 56 % and AUC was unchanged .
Distribution The serum protein binding of azithromycin is variable in the concentration range approximating human exposure , decreasing from 51 % at 0 . 02 mcg / mL to 7 % at 2 mcg / mL .
The antibacterial activity of azithromycin is pH related and appears to be reduced with decreasing pH , However , the extensive distribution of drug to tissues may be relevant to clinical activity .
Azithromycin has been shown to penetrate into human tissues , including skin , lung , tonsil , and cervix .
Extensive tissue distribution was confirmed by examination of additional tissues and fluids ( bone , ejaculum , prostate , ovary , uterus , salpinx , stomach , liver , and gallbladder ) .
As there are no data from adequate and well - controlled studies of azithromycin treatment of infections in these additional body sites , the clinical significance of these tissue concentration data is unknown .
Following a regimen of 500 mg on the first day and 250 mg daily for 4 days , very low concentrations were noted in cerebrospinal fluid ( less than 0 . 01 mcg / mL ) in the presence of noninflamed meninges .
Metabolism In vitro and in vivo studies to assess the metabolism of azithromycin have not been performed .
Elimination Plasma concentrations of azithromycin following single 500 mg oral and IV doses declined in a polyphasic pattern resulting in a mean apparent plasma clearance of 630 mL / min and terminal elimination half - life of 68 hours .
The prolonged terminal half - life is thought to be due to extensive uptake and subsequent release of drug from tissues .
Biliary excretion of azithromycin , predominantly as unchanged drug , is a major route of elimination .
Over the course of a week , approximately 6 % of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Azithromycin acts by binding to the 23 S rRNA of the 50 S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis and impeding the assembly of the 50 S ribosomal subunit .
Resistance Azithromycin demonstrates cross resistance with erythromycin .
The most frequently encountered mechanism of resistance to azithromycin is modification of the 23 S rRNA target , most often by methylation .
Ribosomal modifications can determine cross resistance to other macrolides , lincosamides , and streptogramin B ( MLSβ phenotype ) .
Antimicrobial Activity Azithromycin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections .
[ see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ( 1 ) ] Gram - Positive Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Gram - Negative Bacteria Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Neisseria gonorrhoeae Other Bacteria Chlamydophila pneumoniae Chlamydia trachomatis Mycoplasma pneumoniae The following in vitro data are available , but their clinical significance is unknown .
At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimal inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for azithromycin against isolates of similar genus or organism group .
However , the efficacy of azithromycin in treating clinical infections caused by these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well - controlled clinical trials .

Azithromycin has shown no mutagenic potential in standard laboratory tests : mouse lymphoma assay , human lymphocyte clastogenic assay , and mouse bone marrow clastogenic assay .
In fertility studies conducted in male and female rats , oral administration of azithromycin for 64 to 66 days ( males ) or 15 days ( females ) prior to and during cohabitation resulted in decreased pregnancy rate at 20 and 30 mg / kg / day when both males and females were treated with azithromycin .
This minimal effect on pregnancy rate ( approximately 12 % reduction compared to concurrent controls ) did not become more pronounced when the dose was increased from 20 to 30 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 4 to 0 . 6 times the adult daily dose of 500 mg based on body surface area ) and it was not observed when only one animal in the mated pair was treated .
There were no effects on any other reproductive parameters , and there were no effects on fertility at 10 mg / kg / day .
The relevance of these findings to patients being treated with azithromycin at the doses and durations recommended in the prescribing information is uncertain .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Phospholipidosis ( intracellular phospholipid accumulation ) has been observed in some tissues of mice , rats , and dogs given multiple doses of azithromycin .
It has been demonstrated in numerous organ systems ( e . g . , eye , dorsal root ganglia , liver , gallbladder , kidney , spleen , and / or pancreas ) in dogs and rats treated with azithromycin at doses which , expressed on the basis of body surface area , are similar to or less than the highest recommended adult human dose .
This effect has been shown to be reversible after cessation of azithromycin treatment .
Based on the pharmacokinetic data , phospholipidosis has been seen in the rat ( 50 mg / kg / day dose ) at the observed maximal plasma concentration of 1 . 3 mcg / mL ( 1 . 6 times the observed Cmax of 0 . 821 mcg / mL at the adult dose of 2 g ) .
Similarly , it has been shown in the dog ( 10 mg / kg / day dose ) at the observed maximal serum concentration of 1 mcg / mL ( 1 . 2 times the observed Cmax of 0 . 821 mcg / mL at the adult dose of 2 g ) .
Phospholipidosis was also observed in neonatal rats dosed for 18 days at 30 mg / kg / day , which is less than the pediatric dose of 60 mg / kg based on the surface area .
It was not observed in neonatal rats treated for 10 days at 40 mg / kg / day with mean maximal serum concentrations of 1 . 86 mcg / mL , approximately 1 . 5 times the Cmax of 1 . 27 mcg / mL at the pediatric dose .
Phospholipidosis has been observed in neonatal dogs ( 10 mg / kg / day ) at maximum mean whole blood concentrations of 3 . 54 mcg / mL , approximately 3 times the pediatric dose Cmax .
The significance of these findings for animals and for humans is unknown .
14 . 1 Adult Patients Acute Bacterial Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis In a randomized , double - blind controlled clinical trial of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis ( AECB ) , azithromycin ( 500 mg once daily for 3 days ) was compared with clarithromycin ( 500 mg twice daily for 10 days ) .
The primary endpoint of this trial was the clinical cure rate at Days 21 to 24 .
For the 304 patients analyzed in the modified intent - to - treat analysis at the Days 21 to 24 visit , the clinical cure rate for 3 days of azithromycin was 85 % ( 125 / 147 ) compared to 82 % ( 129 / 157 ) for 10 days of clarithromycin .
The following outcomes were the clinical cure rates at the Days 21 to 24 visit for the bacteriologically evaluable patients by pathogen : Pathogen Azithromycin ( 3 Days ) Clarithromycin ( 10 Days ) S . pneumoniae 29 / 32 ( 91 % ) 21 / 27 ( 78 % ) H . influenzae 12 / 14 ( 86 % ) 14 / 16 ( 88 % ) M . catarrhalis 11 / 12 ( 92 % ) 12 / 15 ( 80 % ) Acute Bacterial Sinusitis In a randomized , double - blind , double - dummy controlled clinical trial of acute bacterial sinusitis , azithromycin ( 500 mg once daily for 3 days ) was compared with amoxicillin / clavulanate ( 500 / 125 mg three times a day for 10 days ) .
Clinical response assessments were made at Day 10 and Day 28 .
The primary endpoint of this trial was prospectively defined as the clinical cure rate at Day 28 .
For the 594 patients analyzed in the modified intent to treat analysis at the Day 10 visit , the clinical cure rate for 3 days of azithromycin was 88 % ( 268 / 303 ) compared to 85 % ( 248 / 291 ) for 10 days of amoxicillin / clavulanate .
For the 586 patients analyzed in the modified intent to treat analysis at the Day 28 visit , the clinical cure rate for 3 days of azithromycin was 71 . 5 % ( 213 / 298 ) compared to 71 . 5 % ( 206 / 288 ) , with a 97 . 5 % confidence interval of – 8 . 4 to 8 . 3 , for 10 days of amoxicillin / clavulanate .
In an open label , non - comparative study requiring baseline transantral sinus punctures , the following outcomes were the clinical success rates at the Day 7 and Day 28 visits for the modified intent to treat patients administered 500 mg of azithromycin once daily for 3 days with the following pathogens : Clinical Success Rates of Azithromycin ( 500 mg per day for 3 Days ) Pathogen Day 7 Day 28 S . pneumoniae 23 / 26 ( 88 % ) 21 / 25 ( 84 % ) H . influenzae 28 / 32 ( 87 % ) 24 / 32 ( 75 % ) M . catarrhalis 14 / 15 ( 93 % ) 13 / 15 ( 87 % ) 14 . 2 Pediatric Patients From the perspective of evaluating pediatric clinical trials , Days 11 to 14 were considered on - therapy evaluations because of the extended half - life of azithromycin .
Days 11 to 14 data are provided for clinical guidance .
Days 24 to 32 evaluations were considered the primary test of cure endpoint .
Pharyngitis / Tonsillitis In three double - blind controlled studies , conducted in the United States , azithromycin ( 12 mg / kg once a day for 5 days ) was compared to penicillin V ( 250 mg three times a day for 10 days ) in the treatment of pharyngitis due to documented Group A β - hemolytic streptococci ( GABHS or S . pyogenes ) .
Azithromycin was clinically and microbiologically statistically superior to penicillin at Day 14 and Day 30 with the following clinical success ( i . e . , cure and improvement ) and bacteriologic efficacy rates ( for the combined evaluable patient with documented GABHS ) : Three U . S . Streptococcal Pharyngitis Studies Azithromycin vs . Penicillin V EFFICACY RESULTS Day 14 Day 30 Bacteriologic Eradication : Azithromycin 323 / 340 ( 95 % ) 255 / 330 ( 77 % ) Penicillin V 242 / 332 ( 73 % ) 206 / 325 ( 63 % ) Clinical Success ( cure plus improvement ) : Azithromycin 336 / 343 ( 98 % ) 310 / 330 ( 94 % ) Penicillin V 284 / 338 ( 84 % ) 241 / 325 ( 74 % ) Approximately 1 % of azithromycin - susceptible S . pyogenes isolates were resistant to azithromycin following therapy .
Acute Otitis Media Efficacy using azithromycin given over 5 days ( 10 mg / kg on Day 1 followed by 5 mg / kg on Days 2 to 5 ) .
Trial 1 In a double - blind , controlled clinical study of acute otitis media performed in the United States , azithromycin ( 10 mg / kg on Day 1 followed by 5 mg / kg on Days 2 to 5 ) was compared to amoxicillin / clavulanate potassium ( 4 : 1 ) .
For the 553 patients who were evaluated for clinical efficacy , the clinical success rate ( i . e . , cure plus improvement ) at the Day 11 visit was 88 % for azithromycin and 88 % for the control agent .
For the 521 patients who were evaluated at the Day 30 visit , the clinical success rate was 73 % for azithromycin and 71 % for the control agent .
Trial 2 In a non - comparative clinical and microbiologic trial performed in the United States , where significant rates of beta - lactamase producing organisms ( 35 % ) were found , 131 patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy .
The combined clinical success rate ( i . e . , cure and improvement ) at the Day 11 visit was 84 % for azithromycin .
For the 122 patients who were evaluated at the Day 30 visit , the clinical success rate was 70 % for azithromycin .
Microbiologic determinations were made at the pre - treatment visit .
Microbiology was not reassessed at later visits .
The following clinical success rates were obtained from the evaluable group : Pathogen Day 11 Day 30 Azithromycin Azithromycin S . pneumoniae 61 / 74 ( 82 % ) 40 / 56 ( 71 % ) H . influenzae 43 / 54 ( 80 % ) 30 / 47 ( 64 % ) M . catarrhalis 28 / 35 ( 80 % ) 19 / 26 ( 73 % ) S . pyogenes 11 / 11 ( 100 % ) 7 / 7 ( 100 % ) Overall 177 / 217 ( 82 % ) 97 / 137 ( 73 % ) Trial 3 In another controlled comparative clinical and microbiologic study of otitis media performed in the United States , azithromycin ( 10 mg / kg on Day 1 followed by 5 mg / kg on Days 2 to 5 ) was compared to amoxicillin / clavulanate potassium ( 4 : 1 ) .
This study utilized two of the same investigators as Protocol 2 ( above ) , and these two investigators enrolled 90 % of the patients in Protocol 3 .
For this reason , Protocol 3 was not considered to be an independent study .
Significant rates of beta - lactamase producing organisms ( 20 % ) were found .
Ninety - two ( 92 ) patients were evaluable for clinical and microbiologic efficacy .
The combined clinical success rate ( i . e . , cure and improvement ) of those patients with a baseline pathogen at the Day 11 visit was 88 % for azithromycin vs . 100 % for control ; at the Day 30 visit , the clinical success rate was 82 % for azithromycin vs . 80 % for control .
Microbiologic determinations were made at the pre - treatment visit .
Microbiology was not reassessed at later visits .
At the Day 11 and Day 30 visits , the following clinical success rates were obtained from the evaluable group : Day 11 Day 30 Pathogen Azithromycin Control Azithromycin Control S . pneumoniae 25 / 29 ( 86 % ) 26 / 26 ( 100 % ) 22 / 28 ( 79 % ) 18 / 22 ( 82 % ) H . influenzae 9 / 11 ( 82 % ) 9 / 9 ( 100 % ) 8 / 10 ( 80 % ) 6 / 8 ( 75 % ) M . catarrhalis 7 / 7 ( 100 % ) 5 / 5 ( 100 % ) 5 / 5 ( 100 % ) 2 / 3 ( 66 % ) S . pyogenes 2 / 2 ( 100 % ) 5 / 5 ( 100 % ) 2 / 2 ( 100 % ) 4 / 4 ( 100 % ) Overall 43 / 49 ( 88 % ) 45 / 45 ( 100 % ) 37 / 45 ( 82 % ) 30 / 37 ( 81 % ) Efficacy using azithromycin given over 3 days ( 10 mg / kg / day ) .
Trial 4 In a double - blind , controlled , randomized clinical study of acute otitis media in pediatric patients from 6 months to 12 years of age , azithromycin ( 10 mg / kg per day for 3 days ) was compared to amoxicillin / clavulanate potassium ( 7 : 1 ) in divided doses q12h for 10 days .
Each patient received active drug and placebo matched for the comparator .
For the 366 patients who were evaluated for clinical efficacy at the Day 12 visit , the clinical success rate ( i . e . , cure plus improvement ) was 83 % for azithromycin and 88 % for the control agent .
