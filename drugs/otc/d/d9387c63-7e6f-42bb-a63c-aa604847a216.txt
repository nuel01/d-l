6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety of ORLADEYO is primarily based on 24 - week ( Part 1 ) data from a 3 - part , double - blind , parallel - group , placebo - controlled study ( Trial 1 ) in 120 patients with Type I or II HAE randomized and dosed with either ORLADEYO 110 mg , 150 mg or placebo , once daily with food .
After Week 24 , patients who continued in the study received active treatment through 48 weeks .
In Trial 1 , a total of 81 patients aged 12 years and older with HAE received at least one dose of ORLADEYO in Part 1 .
Overall , 66 % of patients were female and 93 % of patients were Caucasian with a mean age of 41 . 6 years .
The proportion of patients who discontinued study drug prematurely due to adverse reactions was 7 % and 3 % for patients treated with 110 mg and 150 mg ORLADEYO , respectively , and 3 % for placebo - treated patients .
No deaths occurred in the trial .
The safety profile of ORLADEYO was generally similar across all subgroups of patients , including analysis by age , sex , and geographic region .
Table 1 shows adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 10 % of patients in any ORLADEYO treatment group that also occurred at a higher rate than in the placebo treatment group in Trial 1 .
Table 1 : Adverse Reactions Observed in ≥ 10 % of Patients in any ORLADEYO Treatment Group ( Trial 1 ) Adverse Reaction Placebo ( N = 39 ) ORLADEYO 110 mg ( N = 41 ) 150 mg ( N = 40 ) Total ( N = 81 ) n ( % ) n ( % ) n ( % ) n ( % ) Abdominal Pain [ 1 ] 4 ( 10 ) 4 ( 10 ) 9 ( 23 ) 13 ( 16 ) Vomiting 1 ( 3 ) 4 ( 10 ) 6 ( 15 ) 10 ( 12 ) Diarrhea [ 2 ] 0 4 ( 10 ) 6 ( 15 ) 10 ( 12 ) Back Pain 1 ( 3 ) 1 ( 2 ) 4 ( 10 ) 5 ( 6 ) Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease 0 4 ( 10 ) 2 ( 5 ) 6 ( 7 ) [ 1 ] includes Abdominal pain , Abdominal discomfort , Abdominal pain upper , and Abdominal tenderness [ 2 ] includes Diarrhea and Frequent bowel movements Gastrointestinal reactions , including abdominal pain , vomiting , and diarrhea occurred more frequently in patients receiving ORLADEYO 150 mg versus ORLADEYO 110 mg or placebo .
These reactions generally occurred early after initiation of treatment with ORLADEYO , became less frequent with time , and typically self - resolved .
No patients in the ORLADEYO 150 mg dose group and 1 patient in the ORLADEYO 110 mg dose group discontinued treatment due to a gastrointestinal adverse reaction .
Less Common Adverse Reactions Other adverse reactions that occurred in Part 1 of Trial 1 with an incidence between 5 % and < 10 % at a higher incidence in ORLADEYO - treated patients compared to placebo included headache ( 9 % versus 5 % ) , fatigue ( 6 % versus 3 % ) , and flatulence ( 6 % versus 3 % ) .
A maculopapular drug rash was reported in less than 1 % of patients treated with ORLADEYO .
The rash resolved , including in subjects who continued dosing .
Safety data are also available from 227 patients enrolled in an ongoing , open - label , long - term safety study ( Trial 2 ) who received ORLADEYO 110 mg ( N = 100 ) or 150 mg ( N = 127 ) once daily with food and are consistent with the 24 - week controlled safety data from Trial 1 ( Part 1 ) .
Laboratory Abnormalities Transaminase elevations In Part 1 of Trial 1 , a single 150 mg ORLADEYO - treated patient discontinued treatment due to asymptomatic elevated transaminases ( ALT > 8 × the upper limit of normal [ ULN ] and AST > 3 × ULN ) .
Total bilirubin was normal .
No subject receiving 110 mg or placebo developed transaminase levels > 3 × ULN .
In addition to this patient , 2 ORLADEYO - treated patients developed laboratory - related hepatic adverse events compared to 1 placebo - treated patient .
No patient reported serious adverse reactions of elevated transaminases .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS This section describes clinically relevant drug interactions with ORLADEYO .
Drug interaction studies are described elsewhere in the labeling [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
P - gp or BCRP inhibitors : Reduce ORLADEYO dosage when co - administered .
( 7 . 1 , 12 . 3 ) P - gp inducers : Avoid use with ORLADEYO .
( 7 . 1 ) CYP2D6 , CYP3A4 or P - gp Substrates : Appropriately monitor or dose titrate narrow therapeutic index drugs that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 , CYP3A4 or are P - gp substrates when co - administered with ORLADEYO .
( 7 . 2 , 12 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect ORLADEYO P - gp or BCRP inhibitors ORLADEYO is a P - gp and BCRP substrate .
A dose of 110 mg ORLADEYO is recommended for patients with chronic administration of P - gp or BCRP inhibitors ( e . g . , cyclosporine ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
P - gp Inducers Berotralstat is a substrate of P - gp and BCRP .
P - gp inducers ( e . g . , rifampin , St . John ' s wort ) may decrease berotralstat plasma concentration , leading to reduced efficacy of ORLADEYO .
The use of P - gp inducers is not recommended with ORLADEYO .
7 . 2 Potential for ORLADEYO to Affect Other Drugs CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Substrates ORLADEYO at a dose of 150 mg is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 .
For concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 ( e . g . , thioridazine , pimozide ) or CYP3A4 ( e . g . , cyclosporine , fentanyl ) , appropriate monitoring and dose titration is recommended [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
P - gp Substrates ORLADEYO at a dose of 300 mg is a P - gp inhibitor .
Appropriate monitoring and dose titration is recommended for P - gp substrates ( e . g . , digoxin ) when co - administering with ORLADEYO [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are insufficient data in pregnant women available to inform drug - related risks with ORLADEYO use in pregnancy .
Based on animal reproduction studies , no evidence of structural alterations was observed when berotralstat was administered orally to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to approximately 10 and 2 times , respectively , the maximum recommended human daily dose ( MRHDD ) in adults on an AUC basis ( see Data ) .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of berotralstat to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis did not cause fetal structural alterations .
The berotralstat dose in rats and rabbits was up to approximately 10 and 2 times , respectively , the MRHDD in adults ( on an AUC basis at maternal doses of 75 and 100 mg / kg / day , respectively ) .
In a pre - and postnatal development study in rats , oral administration of berotralstat to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis and until delivery at doses up to 45 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 times of the MRHDD on a mg / m2 basis ) did not cause fetal structural alterations either .
Berotralstat concentrations in the fetal blood were approximately 5 - 11 % of the maternal blood .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of berotralstat in human milk , its effects on the breastfed infant , or its effects on milk production .
However , when a drug is present in animal milk , it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk .
Low levels of berotralstat were detected in the plasma of rat pups when dams were dosed with the drug orally during the lactation period .
The berotralstat concentration in the pup plasma was approximately 2 % of the maternal plasma ( see Data ) .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for ORLADEYO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ORLADEYO or from the underlying maternal condition .
Data Animal Data In the pre - and post - natal development study in rats , berotralstat was administered to dams during the pregnancy and lactation periods at doses up to 45 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 times of the MRHDD on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Berotralstat was detected in the plasma of pups during the lactation period .
The berotralstat concentration in the pup plasma was approximately 2 % of the maternal plasma .
Both dams and pups at 45 mg / kg / day showed statistically significant decreases in body weight gain ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
No treatment - related effects were observed at 25 mg / kg / day ( approximately equal to the MRHDD on a mg / m2 basis ) .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ORLADEYO for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema have been established in pediatric patients aged 12 and older .
Use of ORLADEYO in this population is supported by evidence from an adequate and well - controlled study ( Trial 1 ) that included adults and a total of 6 adolescent patients aged 12 to < 18 years of age .
The safety profile and attack rate on study were similar to those observed in adults [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
An additional 10 adolescent patients aged 12 to < 18 years were enrolled in the open - label study ( Trial 2 ) .
The safety and effectiveness of ORLADEYO in pediatric patients < 12 years of age have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ORLADEYO were evaluated in a subgroup of patients ( N = 9 ) aged ≥ 65 years in Trial 1 .
Results of the subgroup analysis by age were consistent with overall study results .
The safety profile from an additional 5 elderly patients aged ≥ 65 years enrolled in the open - label , long - term safety study ( Trial 2 ) was consistent with data from Trial 1 [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment of ORLADEYO is recommended for patients with mild , moderate or severe renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
ORLADEYO has not been studied in patients with End - Stage Renal Disease ( CLCR < 15 mL / min or eGFR < 15 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 or patients requiring hemodialysis ) , and therefore is not recommended for use in these patient populations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment of ORLADEYO is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh B or C ) , the recommended dose of ORLADEYO is 110 mg once daily with food [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION ORLADEYO ( berotralstat ) capsules is a plasma kallikrein inhibitor .
Berotralstat is presented as the dihydrochloride salt with the chemical name 1 - [ 3 - ( aminomethyl ) phenyl ] - N - ( 5 - { ( R ) - ( 3 - cyanophenyl ) [ ( cyclopropylmethyl ) amino ] methyl } - 2 - fluorophenyl ) - 3 - ( trifluoromethyl ) - 1 H - pyrazole - 5 - carboxamide dihydrochloride .
The chemical structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Berotralstat dihydrochloride is a white to off - white powder that is soluble in water at pH ≤ 4 .
The molecular formula is C30H26F4N6O ∙ 2 HCl and the molecular weight is 635 . 49 ( dihydrochloride ) .
ORLADEYO is supplied as 150 mg ( equivalent to 169 . 4 mg berotralstat dihydrochloride ) and 110 mg ( equivalent to 124 . 3 mg berotralstat dihydrochloride ) hard gelatin capsules for oral administration .
Each capsule contains the active ingredient berotralstat dihydrochloride and the inactive ingredients colloidal silicon dioxide , crospovidone , magnesium stearate , and pregelatinized starch .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Berotralstat is a plasma kallikrein inhibitor that binds to plasma kallikrein and inhibits its proteolytic activity .
Plasma kallikrein is a protease that cleaves high - molecular - weight - kininogen ( HMWK ) to generate cleaved HMWK ( cHMWK ) and bradykinin , a potent vasodilator that increases vascular permeability resulting in swelling and pain associated with HAE .
In patients with HAE due to C1 - inhibitor ( C1 - INH ) deficiency or dysfunction , normal regulation of plasma kallikrein activity is not present , which leads to uncontrolled increases in plasma kallikrein activity and results in angioedema attacks .
Berotralstat decreases plasma kallikrein activity to control excess bradykinin generation in patients with HAE .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Concentration - dependent inhibition of plasma kallikrein , measured as a reduction from baseline of specific enzyme activity , was demonstrated after oral administration of ORLADEYO once daily in patients with HAE .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At the recommended dose of 150 mg once daily , ORLADEYO does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent .
At 3 - times the recommended dose , the mean ( upper 90 % confidence interval ) increase in QTcF was 15 . 9 msec ( 23 . 5 msec ) .
The observed increase in QTcF was concentration - dependent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following oral administration of berotralstat 150 mg once daily , the steady state Cmax and area under the curve over the dosing interval ( AUCtau ) are 158 ng / mL ( range : 110 to 234 ng / mL ) and 2770 ng * hr / mL ( range : 1880 to 3790 ng * hr / mL ) , respectively .
Following oral administration of berotralstat 110 mg once daily , the steady - state Cmax and AUCtau are 97 . 8 ng / mL ( range : 63 to 235 ng / mL ) and 1600 ng * hr / mL ( range : 950 to 4170 ng * hr / mL ) , respectively .
Berotralstat exposure ( Cmax and AUC ) increases greater than proportionally with dose and steady state is reached by days 6 to 12 .
After once - daily administration , exposure of berotralstat at steady state is approximately 5 times that after a single dose .
The pharmacokinetics of berotralstat are similar between healthy adult subjects and in patients with HAE .
Absorption The median time to maximum plasma concentration ( Tmax ) of berotralstat when administered with food is 5 hours ( range : 1 to 8 hours ) .
Effect of Food No differences in the Cmax and AUC of berotralstat were observed following administration with a high - fat meal , however the median Tmax was delayed by 3 hours , from 2 hours ( fasted ) to 5 hours ( fed ) .
Distribution Plasma protein binding is approximately 99 % .
After a single dose of radiolabeled berotralstat 300 mg , the blood to plasma ratio was approximately 0 . 92 .
Elimination The median elimination half - life of berotralstat was approximately 93 hours ( range : 39 to 152 hours ) .
Metabolism Berotralstat is metabolized by CYP2D6 and by CYP3A4 with low turnover in vitro .
After a single oral radiolabeled berotralstat 300 mg dose , berotralstat represented 34 % of the total plasma radioactivity , with 8 metabolites , each accounting for between 1 . 8 and 7 . 8 % of the total radioactivity .
Excretion After a single oral radiolabeled berotralstat 300 mg dose , approximately 9 % was excreted in urine ( 3 . 4 % unchanged ; range : 1 . 8 to 4 . 7 % ) and 79 % was excreted in feces .
Specific Populations Body weight , age , gender , and race did not have a clinically meaningful influence on the systemic exposure of berotralstat .
Geriatric Patients Based on the population pharmacokinetic analyses that included elderly patients ( ≥ 65 to 74 years , N = 25 ) , age does not have a clinically meaningful impact on the systemic exposure of berotralstat [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Pediatric Patients Based on population pharmacokinetic analyses that included pediatric patients 12 to < 18 years of age , exposure at steady state following oral administration of berotralstat 150 mg once daily was approximately 20 % higher compared to adults .
The higher exposure in adolescents is not considered to be clinically meaningful .
Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of a single 200 mg oral dose of berotralstat were studied in subjects with severe renal impairment ( CLCR less than 30 mL / min ) .
When compared to a concurrent cohort with normal renal function ( CLCR greater than 90 mL / min ) , no clinically relevant differences were observed ; Cmax was increased by 47 % , while AUC0 - last was increased by 14 % [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
The pharmacokinetics of berotralstat has not been studied in patients with End - Stage Renal Disease ( CLCR less than 15 mL / min or eGFR less than 15 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 or patients requiring hemodialysis ) .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of a single 150 mg oral dose of berotralstat were studied in subjects with mild , moderate , and severe hepatic function ( Child - Pugh Class A , B , and C , respectively ) .
The pharmacokinetics of berotralstat were unchanged in subjects with mild hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function .
In subjects with moderate hepatic impairment , Cmax was increased by 77 % , while AUC0 - inf was increased by 78 % .
In subjects with severe hepatic impairment , Cmax was increased by 27 % , while AUC0 - last was decreased by 5 % .
The median half - life of berotralstat was increased by 37 % and 22 % in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment , respectively , in comparison to healthy subjects .
The percent of unbound berotralstat increased 2 - fold from a mean of 1 . 2 % in healthy subjects to a mean of 2 . 4 % in subjects with severe hepatic impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of ORLADEYO Berotralstat is a P - gp and BCRP substrate .
Cyclosporine , a P - gp and BCRP inhibitor , increased berotralstat Cmax by 25 % , AUC0 - last by 55 % , and AUC0 - inf by 69 % [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Effect of ORLADEYO on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs Berotralstat 150 mg once daily is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 , and a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 .
Berotralstat at a 300 mg dose is an inhibitor of P - gp and is not an inhibitor of BCRP ( rosuvastatin exposure was decreased by approximately 20 % ) .
The effect of berotralstat on the pharmacokinetics of other drugs are presented in Figure 1 [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Figure 1 : Effect of ORLADEYO on Concomitant Medications [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity of berotralstat was evaluated in a 2 - year study in Wistar rats and a 26 - week study in Tg . rasH2 transgenic mice .
The berotralstat doses ( oral gavage ) were up to 20 and 50 mg / kg / day in rats and mice ( approximately 5 and 10 times the MRHDD on a plasma AUC basis , respectively ) .
No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in either species .
Mutagenesis Berotralstat tested negative in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay ( Ames test ) , the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes , and the in vivo rat micronucleus assay .
Impairment of Fertility In a fertility study in rats , berotralstat at oral doses up to 45 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 times the MRHDD on a mg / m2 basis ) showed no effect on fertility in males or females .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Trial 1 ( NCT3485911 ) The efficacy of ORLADEYO for the prevention of angioedema attacks in patients 12 years of age and older with Type I or II HAE was demonstrated in Part 1 of a multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel - group study ( Trial 1 ) .
The study included 120 adult and adolescent patients who experienced at least two investigator - confirmed attacks within the first 8 weeks of the run - in period and took at least one dose of study treatment .
Patients were randomized into 1 of 3 parallel treatment arms , stratified by baseline attack rate , in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio ( berotralstat 110 mg , berotralstat 150 mg , or placebo by oral administration once daily , with food ) for the 24 - week treatment period ( Part 1 ) .
Patients discontinued other prophylactic HAE medications prior to entering the study ; however , all patients were allowed to use rescue medications for treatment of breakthrough HAE attacks .
A history of laryngeal angioedema attacks was reported in 74 % of patients and 75 % reported prior use of long - term prophylaxis .
The median attack rate during the prospective run - in period ( baseline attack rate ) was 2 . 9 / month .
Seventy percent of patients enrolled had a baseline attack rate of ≥ 2 attacks / month .
ORLADEYO 150 mg and 110 mg produced statistically significant reductions in the rate of HAE attacks compared to placebo for the primary endpoint in the Intent - to - Treat ( ITT ) population as shown in Table 2 .
The percent reductions in HAE attack rate were greater with ORLADEYO 150 mg and 110 mg relative to placebo , regardless of attack rate during the run - in period .
