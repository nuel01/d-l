Indications and Usage ( 1 ) 7 / 2022 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clofarabine injection is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 to 21 years old with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia after at least two prior regimens .
Clofarabine injection is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 to 21 years old with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia after at least two prior regimens .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Administer the recommended pediatric dose of 52 mg / m2 as an intravenous infusion over 2 hours daily for 5 consecutive days of a 28 - day cycle .
Repeat cycles every 2 to 6 weeks .
( 2 . 1 ) • Provide supportive care , such as intravenous infusion fluids , antihyperuricemic treatment , and alkalinization of urine throughout the 5 days of clofarabine injection administration to reduce the risk of tumor lysis and other adverse reactions .
( 2 . 1 ) • Discontinue clofarabine injection if hypotension develops during the 5 days of administration .
( 2 . 1 ) • Reduce the dose in patients with renal impairment .
( 2 . 2 ) • Use dose modification for toxicity .
( 2 . 4 ) 2 . 1 Recommended Dosage Administer the recommended pediatric dose of 52 mg / m2 as an intravenous infusion over 2 hours daily for 5 consecutive days .
• Repeat treatment cycles following recovery or return to baseline organ function , approximately every 2 to 6 weeks .
Base dosage on the patient ’ s body surface area ( BSA ) , calculated using the actual height and weight before the start of each cycle .
To prevent drug incompatibilities , do not administer other medications through the same intravenous line .
Administer subsequent cycles no sooner than 14 days from the starting day of the previous cycle and provided the patient ’ s ANC is ≥ 0 . 75 × 109 / L .
• Provide supportive care , such as intravenous fluids , antihyperuricemic treatment , and alkalinize urine throughout the 5 days of clofarabine injection administration to reduce the effects of tumor lysis and other adverse reactions .
• Discontinue clofarabine injection if hypotension develops during the 5 days of administration .
• Monitor renal and hepatic function during the 5 days of clofarabine injection administration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 , 5 . 8 ) ] .
• Monitor patients taking medications known to affect blood pressure .
Monitor cardiac function during administration of clofarabine injection .
2 . 2 Recommended Dosage Reduction for Renal Impairment • Reduce the dose by 50 % in patients with creatinine clearance ( CrCL ) between 30 mL / min and 60 mL / min .
There is insufficient information to make a dosage recommendation in patients with CrCL less than 30 mL / min [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
2 . 3 Potential Concomitant Medications and Medications to Avoid • Consider prophylactic antiemetic medications as clofarabine injection is moderately emetogenic .
• Consider the use of prophylactic steroids to mitigate Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ( SIRS ) or capillary leak syndrome ( e . g . , hypotension , tachycardia , tachypnea , and pulmonary edema ) .
• Minimize exposure to drugs with known renal toxicity during the 5 days of clofarabine injection administration since the risk of renal toxicity may be increased .
• Avoid concomitant use of medications known to induce hepatic toxicity .
2 . 4 Dose Modifications and Reinitiation of Therapy after Adverse Reactions Hematologic Toxicity • If a patient experiences a Grade 4 neutropenia ( ANC < 0 . 5 x 109 / L ) lasting ≥ 4 weeks , reduce dose by 25 % for the next cycle .
Non - hematologic Toxicity • Withhold clofarabine injection if a patient develops a clinically significant infection , until the infection is controlled , then restart at the full dose .
• Withhold clofarabine injection for a Grade 3 non - infectious non - hematologic toxicity ( excluding transient elevations in serum transaminases and / or serum bilirubin and / or nausea / vomiting controlled by antiemetic therapy ) .
Re - institute clofarabine injection administration at a 25 % dose reduction when resolution or return to baseline .
• Discontinue clofarabine injection administration for a Grade 4 non - infectious non - hematologic toxicity .
• Discontinue clofarabine injection administration if a patient shows early signs or symptoms of SIRS or capillary leak syndrome ( e . g . , hypotension , tachycardia , tachypnea , and pulmonary edema ) occur and provide appropriate supportive measures .
• Discontinue clofarabine injection administration if Grade 3 or higher increases in creatinine or bilirubin are noted .
Re - institute clofarabine injection with a 25 % dose reduction , when the patient is stable and organ function has returned to baseline .
If hyperuricemia is anticipated ( tumor lysis ) , initiate measures to control uric acid .
2 . 5 Reconstitution / Preparation Filter clofarabine injection through a sterile 0 . 2 micron syringe filter and then dilute with 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP , or 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP , prior to intravenous infusion to a final concentration between 0 . 15 mg / mL and 0 . 4 mg / mL .
Use within 24 hours of preparation .
Parenteral drug products should be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
Store diluted clofarabine injection at room temperature ( 15 ° to 30ºC ) .
Discard unused portion in vial .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Injection : 20 mg / 20 mL ( 1 mg / mL ) clear solution in single - dose vial • Injection : 20 mg / 20 mL ( 1 mg / mL ) single - dose vial .
( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None .

( 5 . 3 ) • Tumor Lysis syndrome : Anticipate , monitor for signs and symptoms and treat promptly .
( 5 . 4 ) • Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ( SIRS ) or Capillary Leak Syndrome : Monitor for and discontinue clofarabine immediately if suspected .
( 5 . 5 ) • Venous Occlusive Disease of the Liver : Monitor for and discontinue clofarabine if suspected .
( 5 . 6 ) • Hepatotoxicity : Severe and fatal hepatotoxicity .
Monitor liver function , for signs and symptoms of hepatitis and hepatic failure .
Discontinue clofarabine immediately for Grade 3 or greater liver enzyme and / or bilirubin elevations .
( 5 . 7 ) • Renal Toxicity : Increased creatinine and acute renal failure ; monitor renal function and interrupt or discontinue clofarabine .
( 5 . 8 ) • Enterocolitis : Serious and fatal enterocolitis , occurring more frequently within 30 days of treatment and with combination chemotherapy .
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis and treat promptly .
( 5 . 9 ) • Skin Reactions : Stevens - Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , including fatal cases .
Discontinue for exfoliative or bullous rash , or if SJS or TEN is suspected .
( 5 . 10 ) • Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm .
Advise females of reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception .
( 5 . 11 ) 5 . 1 Myelosuppression Clofarabine causes myelosuppression which may be severe and prolonged .
Febrile neutropenia occurred in 55 % and non - febrile neutropenia in an additional 10 % of pediatric patients in clinical trials .
At initiation of treatment , most patients in the clinical studies had hematological impairment as a manifestation of leukemia .
Myelosuppression is usually reversible with interruption of clofarabine treatment and appears to be dose - dependent .
Monitor complete blood counts [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 2 Hemorrhage Serious and fatal hemorrhage , including cerebral , gastrointestinal and pulmonary hemorrhage , has occurred .
The majority of the cases were associated with thrombocytopenia .
Monitor platelets and coagulation parameters and treat accordingly [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 3 Infections Clofarabine increases the risk of infection , including severe and fatal sepsis , and opportunistic infections .
At baseline , 48 % of the pediatric patients had one or more concurrent infections .
A total of 83 % of patients experienced at least one infection after clofarabine treatment , including fungal , viral and bacterial infections .
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection , discontinue clofarabine , and treat promptly .
5 . 4 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Administration of clofarabine may result in tumor lysis syndrome associated with the break - down metabolic products from peripheral leukemia cell death .
Monitor patients undergoing treatment for signs and symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome and initiate preventive measures including adequate intravenous fluids and measures to control uric acid .
5 . 5 Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ( SIRS ) and Capillary Leak Syndrome Clofarabine may cause a cytokine release syndrome ( e . g . , tachypnea , tachycardia , hypotension , pulmonary edema ) that may progress to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) with capillary leak syndrome and organ impairment which may be fatal .
Monitor patients frequently for these conditions .
In clinical trials , SIRS was reported in two patients ( 2 % ) ; capillary leak syndrome was reported in four patients ( 4 % ) .
Symptoms included rapid onset of respiratory distress , hypotension , pleural and pericardial effusion , and multiorgan failure .
Close monitoring for this syndrome and early intervention may reduce the risk .
Immediately discontinue clofarabine and provide appropriate supportive measures .
The use of prophylactic steroids ( e . g . , 100 mg / m2 hydrocortisone on Days 1 through 3 ) may be of benefit in preventing signs or symptoms of SIRS or capillary leak syndrome .
Consider use of diuretics and / or albumin .
After the patient is stabilized and organ function has returned to baseline , retreatment with clofarabine can be considered with a 25 % dose reduction .
5 . 6 Venous Occlusive Disease of the Liver Patients who have previously received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) are at higher risk for veno - occlusive disease ( VOD ) of the liver following treatment with clofarabine ( 40 mg / m2 ) when used in combination with etoposide ( 100 mg / m2 ) and cyclophosphamide ( 440 mg / m2 ) .
Severe hepatotoxic events have been reported in a combination study of clofarabine in pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia .
Two cases ( 2 % ) of VOD in the monotherapy studies were considered related to study drug .
Monitor for and discontinue clofarabine if VOD is suspected .
5 . 7 Hepatotoxicity Severe and fatal hepatotoxicity , including hepatitis and hepatic failure , has occurred with the use of clofarabine .
In clinical studies , Grade 3 to 4 liver enzyme elevations were observed in pediatric patients during treatment with clofarabine at the following rates : elevated aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) occurred in 36 % of patients ; elevated alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) occurred in 44 % of patients .
AST and ALT elevations typically occurred within 10 days of clofarabine administration and returned to Grade 2 or less within 15 days .
Grade 3 or 4 elevated bilirubin occurred in 13 % of patients , with 2 events reported as Grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia ( 2 % ) , one of which resulted in treatment discontinuation and one patient had multiorgan failure and died .
Eight patients ( 7 % ) had Grade 3 or 4 elevations in serum bilirubin at the last time point measured ; these patients died due to sepsis and / or multiorgan failure .
Monitor hepatic function , and for signs and symptoms of hepatitis and hepatic failure .
Discontinue clofarabine immediately for Grade 3 or greater liver enzyme and / or bilirubin elevations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 8 Renal Toxicity Clofarabine may cause acute renal failure .
In clofarabine treated patients in clinical studies , Grade 3 or 4 elevated creatinine occurred in 8 % of patients and acute renal failure was reported as Grade 3 in three patients ( 3 % ) and Grade 4 in two patients ( 2 % ) .
Patients with infection , sepsis , or tumor lysis syndrome may be at increased risk of renal toxicity when treated with clofarabine .
Hematuria occurred in 13 % of clofarabine treated patients overall .
Monitor patients for renal toxicity and interrupt or discontinue clofarabine as necessary [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 9 Enterocolitis Fatal and serious cases of enterocolitis , including neutropenic colitis , cecitis , and C . difficile colitis , have occurred during treatment with clofarabine .
This has occurred more frequently within 30 days of treatment , and in the setting of combination chemotherapy .
Enterocolitis may lead to necrosis , perforation , hemorrhage or sepsis complications .
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis and treat promptly .
5 . 10 Skin Reactions Serious and fatal cases of Stevens - Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) and toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) have been reported .
Discontinue clofarabine for exfoliative or bullous rash , or if SJS or TEN is suspected [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 11 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on findings from animal reproductive studies and the drug ’ s mechanism of action , clofarabine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Intravenous doses of clofarabine in rats and rabbits administered during organogenesis at doses that were below the maximum recommended human dose of 52 mg / m2 based on body surface area ( mg / m2 ) caused an increase in resorptions , malformations , and variations .
Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with clofarabine and for 6 months after the last dose .
Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with clofarabine and for 3 months after the last dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Gastrointestinal disorders : gastrointestinal hemorrhage including fatalities .
• Metabolism and nutrition disorders : hyponatremia • Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Stevens - Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) , toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) ( including fatal cases ) .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary In animal reproduction studies , intravenous administration of clofarabine to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 0 . 2 to 1 - times the maximum recommended human dose of 52 mg / m2 based on body surface area ( BSA ) resulted in embryo - fetal mortality , alterations to growth , and structural abnormalities ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
There are no available data on clofarabine use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Clofarabine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits to the mother outweigh the potential risks , including those to the fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal data Intravenous administration of clofarabine to pregnant rats during organogenesis ( gestation days [ GD ] 7 to 17 ) at doses of 1 mg / kg / day , 3 mg / kg / day or 9 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 6 mg / m2 / day , 18 mg / m2 / day , 54 mg / m2 / day ) resulted in maternal toxicities at the 9 mg / kg dose , as indicated by reduced body weights and food consumption .
Developmental toxicity ( i . e . reduced fetal body weights and increased post implantation loss ) and increased incidences of external , soft tissue , and skeletal malformations and variations ( including retarded ossification ) were observed at 9 mg / kg / day ( 54 mg / m2 ; approximately equivalent to the recommended human dose based on BSA ) .
Altered ossification patterns ( extra metacarpal or metatarsal ossification ) were observed in single fetuses at lower doses of clofarabine ( 1 mg / kg / day and 3 mg / kg / day ; 0 . 1 - and 0 . 3 - times the recommended human dose based on BSA ) .
When clofarabine was administered intravenously to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis ( GD 6 to 18 ) at doses of 0 . 1 mg / kg / day , 0 . 3 mg / kg / day or 1 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 1 . 2 mg / m2 / day , 3 . 6 mg / m2 / day , 12 mg / m2 / day ) , developmental toxicity ( i . e . reduced fetal body weights and increased post implantation loss ) and increased incidences of external , soft tissue , and skeletal malformations and variations ( including retarded ossification ) were observed at the 1 mg / kg / day dose ( 12 mg / m2 ; 0 . 2 - times the recommended human dose based on BSA ) .
Alterations in ossification patterns ( increase in the average numbers of ossified thoracic vertebrae and rib pairs , and reduction in the average number of forepaw metacarpals ) and abdominal wall defect were observed at 0 . 3 mg / kg / day ( 3 . 6 mg / m2 ; 0 . 1 - times the recommended human dose based on BSA ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of clofarabine in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child including genotoxicity , advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with clofarabine , and for 2 weeks after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Clofarabine can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential prior to initiating clofarabine .
Contraception Females Advise female patients to use effective contraception during treatment with clofarabine and for 6 months after the last dose .
Males Based on genotoxicity findings , advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with clofarabine and for 3 months after the last dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Females Based on findings from animal studies , Clofarabine may impair female fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown .
Males Based on findings from animal studies , Clofarabine may impair male fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness have been established in pediatric patients 1 to 21 years old with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness of clofarabine has not been established in geriatric patients aged 65 and older .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Reduce the clofarabine starting dose by 50 % in patients with CrCL of 30 mL / min to 60 mL / min .
There is insufficient information to make a dosage recommendation in patients with CrCL less than 30 mL / min or in patients on dialysis .
The pharmacokinetics of clofarabine in patients with renal impairment and normal renal function were obtained from a population pharmacokinetic analysis of three pediatric and two adult studies .
In patients with CrCL 60 to less than 90 mL / min ( N = 47 ) and CrCL 30 to less than 60 mL / min ( N = 30 ) , the average AUC of clofarabine increased by 60 % and 140 % , respectively , compared to patients with normal ( N = 66 ) renal function ( CrCL greater than 90 mL / min ) .
10 OVERDOSAGE There were no known overdoses of clofarabine .
The highest daily dose administered to a human to date ( on a mg / m2 basis ) has been 70 mg / m2 / day × 5 days ( 2 pediatric ALL patients ) .
The toxicities included in these 2 patients included Grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia , Grade 2 and 3 vomiting , and Grade 3 maculopapular rash .
In a Phase 1 study of adults with refractory and / or relapsed hematologic malignancies , the recommended pediatric dose of 52 mg / m2 / day was not tolerated .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Clofarabine is sequentially metabolized intracellularly to the 5 ’ - monophosphate metabolite by deoxycytidine kinase and mono - and di - phospho - kinases to the active 5 ’ - triphosphate metabolite .
Clofarabine has affinity for the activating phosphorylating enzyme , deoxycytidine kinase , equal to or greater than that of the natural substrate , deoxycytidine .
Clofarabine inhibits DNA synthesis by decreasing cellular deoxynucleotide triphosphate pools through an inhibitory action on ribonucleotide reductase , and by terminating DNA chain elongation and inhibiting repair through incorporation into the DNA chain by competitive inhibition of DNA polymerases .
The affinity of clofarabine triphosphate for these enzymes is similar to or greater than that of deoxyadenosine triphosphate .
In preclinical models , clofarabine has demonstrated the ability to inhibit DNA repair by incorporation into the DNA chain during the repair process .
Clofarabine 5 ’ - triphosphate also disrupts the integrity of mitochondrial membrane , leading to the release of the pro - apoptotic mitochondrial proteins , cytochrome C and apoptosis - inducing factor , leading to programmed cell death .
Clofarabine is cytotoxic to rapidly proliferating and quiescent cancer cell types in vitro .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The population pharmacokinetics of clofarabine were studied in 40 pediatric patients aged 2 to 19 years ( 21 males / 19 females ) with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) or acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) .
At the given 52 mg / m2 dose , similar concentrations were obtained over a wide range of body surface areas ( BSAs ) .
Clofarabine was 47 % bound to plasma proteins , predominantly to albumin .
Based on non - compartmental analysis , systemic clearance and volume of distribution at steady - state were 28 . 8 L / h / m2 and 172 L / m2 , respectively .
The terminal half - life was 5 . 2 hours .
No apparent difference in pharmacokinetics was observed between patients with ALL and AML or between males and females .
No relationship between clofarabine or clofarabine triphosphate exposure and toxicity or response was found in this population .
Based on 24 - hour urine collections in the pediatric studies , 49 % to 60 % of the dose is excreted in the urine unchanged .
In vitro studies using isolated human hepatocytes indicate very limited metabolism ( 0 . 2 % ) .
The pathways of non - hepatic elimination remain unknown .
Clofarabine has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment .
Drug - Drug Interactions In vitro studies suggested that clofarabine undergoes limited metabolism and does not inhibit or induce major CYP enzymes .
CYP inhibitors and inducers are unlikely to affect the metabolism of clofarabine .
Clofarabine is unlikely to affect the metabolism of CYP substrates .
However , no in vivo drug interaction studies have been conducted .
An in vitro transporter study suggested that clofarabine is a substrate of human transporters OAT1 , OAT3 , and OCT1 .
A preclinical study using perfused rat kidney demonstrated that the renal excretion of clofarabine was decreased by cimetidine , an inhibitor of the hOCT2 .
Although the clinical implications of this finding have not been determined , signs of clofarabine toxicity should be monitored when administered with other hOAT1 , hOAT3 , hOCT1 and hOCT2 substrates or inhibitors .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Clofarabine has not been tested for carcinogenic potential .
Clofarabine was clastogenic in the in vitro mammalian cell chromosome aberration assay ( CHO cells ) and in the in vivo rat micronucleus assay .
Clofarabine was not mutagenic in the bacterial mutation assay ( Ames test ) .
Studies in mice , rats , and dogs have demonstrated dose - related adverse effects on male reproductive organs .
Seminiferous tubule and testicular degeneration and atrophy were reported in male mice receiving intraperitoneal doses of 3 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 2 - times the recommended human dose based on body surface area [ BSA ] ) .
Rats receiving 25 mg / kg / day ( approximately 3 - times the recommended human dose based on BSA ) in a 6 - month intravenous study had testicular findings of bilateral degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium with retained spermatids and atrophy of interstitial cells .
In a 6 - month intravenous dog study , cell degeneration of the epididymis and degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium in the testes were observed at 0 . 375 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 1 - times the recommended human dose on a BSA basis ) .
Ovarian atrophy or degeneration and uterine mucosal apoptosis were observed in female mice at 75 mg / kg / day ( approximately 4 - times the recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) , the only dose administered to female mice .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Seventy - eight ( 78 ) pediatric patients with ALL were exposed to clofarabine .
Seventy ( 70 ) of the patients received the recommended pediatric dose of clofarabine 52 mg / m2 daily for 5 days as an intravenous infusion .
Dose Escalation Study in Pediatric Patients with Hematologic Malignancies The safety and efficacy of clofarabine were evaluated in pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed hematologic malignancies in an open - label , dose - escalation , noncomparative study ( NCT00042341 , A Phase II , Open Label Study of Clofarabine in Pediatric Patients With Refractory or Relapsed Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ) .
The starting dose of clofarabine was 11 . 25 mg / m2 / day intravenous infusion daily × 5 and escalated to 70 mg / m2 / day intravenous infusion daily × 5 .
This dosing schedule was repeated every 2 to 6 weeks depending on toxicity and response .
Nine of 17 ALL patients were treated with clofarabine 52 mg / m2 daily for 5 days .
In the 17 ALL patients there were 2 complete remissions ( 12 % ) and 2 partial remissions ( 12 % ) at varying doses .
Dose - limiting toxicities in this study were reversible hyperbilirubinemia and elevated transaminase levels and skin rash , experienced at 70 mg / m2 .
As a result of this study , the recommended dose for subsequent study in pediatric patients was determined to be 52 mg / m2 / day for 5 days .
Single - Arm Study in Pediatric ALL Clofarabine was evaluated in an open - label , single - arm study ( NCT00042341 ) of 61 pediatric patients with relapsed / refractory ALL .
Patients received a dose of 52 mg / m2 intravenous infusion over 2 hours for 5 consecutive days repeated every 2 to 6 weeks for up to 12 cycles .
There was no dose escalation in this study .
All patients had disease that had relapsed after and / or was refractory to two or more prior therapies .
Most patients , 38 / 61 ( 62 % ) , had received > 2 prior regimens and 18 / 61 ( 30 % ) of the patients had undergone at least 1 prior transplant .
The median age of the treated patients was 12 years , 61 % were male , 39 % were female , 44 % were White , 38 % were Hispanic or Latino , 12 % were Black or African - American , 2 % were Asian and 5 % were Other race .
The overall remission ( OR ) rate ( Complete Remission [ CR ] + CR in the absence of total platelet recovery [ CRp ] ) was evaluated .
CR was defined as no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease , an M1 bone marrow ( ≤ 5 % blasts ) , and recovery of peripheral counts [ platelets ≥ 100 × 109 / L and absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1 × 109 / L ] .
CRp was defined as meeting all criteria for CR except for recovery of platelet counts to ≥ 100 × 109 / L .
Partial Response ( PR ) was also determined , defined as complete disappearance of circulating blasts , an M2 bone marrow ( ≥ 5 % and ≤ 25 % blasts ) , and appearance of normal progenitor cells or an M1 marrow that did not qualify for CR or CRp .
Duration of remission was also evaluated .
Transplantation rate was not a study endpoint .
Response rates for these studies were determined by an unblinded Independent Response Review Panel ( IRRP ) .
Table 3 summarizes results for the pediatric ALL study .
Responses were seen in both pre - B and T - cell immunophenotypes of ALL .
The median cumulative dose was 530 mg ( range 29 mg to 2815 mg ) in 1 ( 41 % ) , 2 ( 44 % ) or 3 or more ( 15 % ) cycles .
The median number of cycles was 2 ( range 1 to 12 ) .
The median time between cycles was 28 days with a range of 12 to 55 days .
Table 3 : Results in Single - Arm Pediatric ALL N = 61 CR % [ 95 % CI ] 11 . 5 ( 4 . 7 , 22 . 2 ) CRp % [ 95 % CI ] 8 . 2 ( 2 . 7 , 18 . 1 ) Median Duration of CR plus CRp ( range in weeks ) 1 10 . 7 ( 4 . 3 to 58 . 6 ) CR = Complete response CRp = Complete response without platelet recovery 1 Does not include 4 patients who were transplanted ( duration of response , including response after transplant , in these 4 patients was 28 . 6 to 107 . 7 weeks ) .
The median duration of CR , including patients who received transplantation , was 47 . 9 weeks ( range 4 . 3 to 107 . 7 + ) , where + indicates the patient was still in CR by the study end .
Of 35 patients who were refractory to their immediately preceding induction regimen , 6 ( 17 % ) achieved a CR or CRp .
Of 18 patients who had at least 1 prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) , 5 ( 28 % ) achieved a CR or CRp .
Among the 12 patients who achieved at least a CRp , 6 patients achieved the best response after 1 cycle of clofarabine , 5 patients required 2 courses and 1 patient achieved a CR after 3 cycles of therapy .
