The base doxycycline has a high degree of lipid solubility and a low affinity for calcium binding .
It is highly stable in normal human serum .
Each 100 mg vial contains : Doxycycline hyclate equivalent to 100 mg doxycycline ; ascorbic acid 480 mg ; mannitol 300 mg .
pH of the reconstituted solution ( 10 mg / mL ) is between 1 . 8 and 3 . 3 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tetracyclines are readily absorbed and are bound to plasma proteins in varying degree .
They are concentrated by the liver in the bile , and excreted in the urine and feces at high concentrations and in a biologically active form .
Following a single 100 mg dose administered in a concentration of 0 . 4 mg / mL in a one - hour infusion , normal adult volunteers averaged a peak of 2 . 5 mcg / mL , while 200 mg of a concentration of 0 . 4 mg / mL administered over two hours averaged a peak of 3 . 6 mcg / mL .
Excretion of doxycycline by the kidney is about 40 percent / 72 hours in individuals with normal function ( creatinine clearance about 75 mL / min ) .
This percentage of excretion may fall as low as 1 to 5 percent / 72 hours in individuals with severe renal insufficiency ( creatinine clearance below 10 mL / min ) .
Studies have shown no significant difference in serum half - life of doxycycline ( range 18 to 22 hours ) in individuals with normal and severely impaired renal function .
Hemodialysis does not alter this serum half - life of doxycycline .
Microbiology Mechanism of Action Doxycycline inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30 S ribosomal subunit .
Doxycycline has bacteriostatic activity against a broad range of Gram - positive and Gram - negative bacteria .
Resistance Cross resistance with other tetracyclines is common .
Antimicrobial Activity Doxycycline has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections ( see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) .
Gram - Negative Bacteria Acinetobacter species Bartonella bacilliformis Brucella species Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Francisella tularensis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella granulomatis Klebsiella species Neisseria gonorrhoeae Shigella species Vibrio cholerae Campylobacter fetus Yersinia pestis Gram - Positive Bacteria Bacillus anthracis Listeria monocytogenes Streptococcus pneumoniae Anaerobic Bacteria Clostridium species Fusobacterium fusiforme Propionibacterium acnes Other Bacteria Nocardiae and other aerobic Actinomyces species Borrelia recurrentis Chlamydophila psittaci Chlamydia trachomatis Mycoplasma pneumoniae Rickettsiae Treponema pallidum Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue Ureaplasma urealyticum Parasites Balantidium coli Entamoeba species Plasmodium falciparum * * Doxycycline has been found to be active against the asexual erythrocytic forms of Plasmodium falciparum but not against the gametocytes of P . falciparum .
The precise mechanism of action of the drug is not known .
Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug , please see : https : / / www . fda . gov / STIC .
INDICATIONS & USAGE To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Doxycycline for Injection , USP and other antibacterial drugs , Doxycycline for Injection , USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria .
When culture and susceptibility information are available , they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy .
In the absence of such data , local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy .
Doxycycline for Injection , USP is indicated in infections caused by the following microorganisms : Rickettsiae ( Rocky Mountain spotted fever , typhus fever , and the typhus group , Q fever , rickettsial pox and tick fevers ) .
Mycoplasma pneumoniae ( PPLO , Eaton Agent ) .
Agents of psittacosis and ornithosis .
Agents of lymphogranuloma venereum and granuloma inguinale .
The spirochetal agent of relapsing fever ( Borrelia recurrentis ) .
The following gram - negative microorganisms : Haemophilus ducreyi ( chancroid ) .
Yersinia pestis ( formerly Pasteurella pestis ) and Francisella tularensis ( formerly Pasteurella tularensis ) .
Bartonella bacilliformis .
Bacteroides species .
Vibrio cholerae ( formerly Vibrio comma ) and Campylobacter fetus ( formerly Vibrio fetus ) .
Brucella species ( in conjunction with streptomycin ) .
Because many strains of the following groups of microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to tetracyclines , culture and susceptibility testing are recommended .
Doxycycline is indicated for treatment of infections caused by the following gram - negative microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug : Escherichia coli .
Enterobacter aerogenes ( formerly Aerobacter aerogenes ) .
Shigella species .
Acinetobacter species ( formerly Mima species and Herellea species ) .
Haemophilus influenzae ( respiratory infections ) .
Klebsiella species ( respiratory and urinary infections ) .
Doxycycline is indicated for treatment of infections caused by the following gram - positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug : Streptococcus species : Up to 44 percent of strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 74 percent of Enterococcus faecalis ( formerly Streptococcus faecalis ) have been found to be resistant to tetracycline drugs .
Therefore , tetracyclines should not be used for streptococcal disease unless the organism has been demonstrated to be sensitive .
For upper respiratory infections due to group A beta - hemolytic streptococci , penicillin is the usual drug of choice , including prophylaxis of rheumatic fever .
Streptococcus pneumoniae ( formerly Diplococcus pneumoniae ) .
Staphylococcus aureus , respiratory , skin and soft tissue infections .
Tetracyclines are not the drugs of choice in the treatment of any type of staphylococcal infections .
Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis , including inhalational anthrax ( post - exposure ) : to reduce the incidence or progression of disease following exposure to aerosolized Bacillus anthracis .
When penicillin is contraindicated , doxycycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of infections due to : Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N . meningitidis .
Treponema pallidum and Treponema pertenue ( syphilis and yaws ) .
Listeria monocytogenes .
Clostridium species .
Fusobacterium fusiforme ( Vincent ' s infection ) .
Actinomyces species .
In acute intestinal amebiasis , doxycycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides .
Doxycycline is indicated in the treatment of trachoma , although the infectious agent is not always eliminated , as judged by immunofluorescence .
CONTRAINDICATIONS This drug is contraindicated in persons who have shown hypersensitivity to any of the tetracyclines .
WARNINGS The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development ( last half of pregnancy , infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years ) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth ( yellow - gray - brown ) .
This adverse reaction is more common during long - term use of the drugs but has been observed following repeated short - term courses .
Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported .
Use doxycycline in pediatric patients 8 years of age or less only when the potential benefits are expected to outweigh the risks in severe or life - threatening conditions ( e . g . , anthrax , Rocky Mountain spotted fever ) , particularly when there are no alternative therapies .
Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including doxycycline for injection , USP , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibiotic treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
Severe skin reactions , such as exfoliative dermatitis , erythema multiforme , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis , and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) have been reported in patients receiving doxycycline ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
If severe skin reactions occur , doxycycline should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy should be instituted .
Intracranial hypertension ( IH , pseudotumor cerebri ) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including doxycycline .
Clinical manifestations of IH include headache , blurred vision , diplopia , and vision loss ; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy .
Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH .
Concomitant use of isotretinoin and doxycycline should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri .
Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment , the possibility for permanent visual loss exists .
If visual disturbance occurs during treatment , prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted .
Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize .
Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines .
Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light , should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs , and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema .
The anti - anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN .
Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function .
PRECAUTIONS The use of drugs of the tetracycline class during tooth development ( last half of pregnancy , infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years ) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth ( yellow - gray - brown ) .
