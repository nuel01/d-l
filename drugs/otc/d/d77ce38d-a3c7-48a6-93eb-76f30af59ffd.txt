Warning and Precautions , Severe Liver Injury ( 5 . 2 ) 06 / 2009 Warnings and Precautions , Effects on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate ( 5 . 4 ) 09 / 2008 Boxed Warning 07 / 2008 Warnings and Precautions , Suicidal Ideation ( 5 . 1 ) , Effects on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate ( 5 . 4 ) , Effects on Urine Outflow from the Bladder ( 5 . 9 ) 07 / 2008 WARNING : SUICIDAL IDEATION IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS STRATTERA ( atomoxetine ) increased the risk of suicidal ideation in short – term studies in children or adolescents with Attention – Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) .
Anyone considering the use of STRATTERA in a child or adolescent must balance this risk with the clinical need .
Co - morbidities occurring with ADHD may be associated with an increase in the risk of suicidal ideation and / or behavior .
Patients who are started on therapy should be monitored closely for suicidality ( suicidal thinking and behavior ) , clinical worsening , or unusual changes in behavior .
Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber .
STRATTERA is approved for ADHD in pediatric and adult patients .
STRATTERA is not approved for major depressive disorder .
Pooled analyses of short – term ( 6 to 18 weeks ) placebo – controlled trials of STRATTERA in children and adolescents ( a total of 12 trials involving over 2200 patients , including 11 trials in ADHD and 1 trial in enuresis ) have revealed a greater risk of suicidal ideation early during treatment in those receiving STRATTERA compared to placebo .
The average risk of suicidal ideation in patients receiving STRATTERA was 0 . 4 % ( 5 / 1357 patients ) , compared to none in placebo – treated patients ( 851 patients ) .
No suicides occurred in these trials [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
WARNING : SUICIDAL IDEATION IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning .
• Increased risk of suicidal ideation in children or adolescents ( 5 . 1 ) • No suicides occurred in clinical trials ( 5 . 1 ) • Patients started on therapy should be monitored closely ( 5 . 1 ) 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE STRATTERA ® is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor indicated for the treatment of Attention – Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) .
( 1 . 1 ) 1 . 1 Attention – Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) STRATTERA is indicated for the treatment of Attention – Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) .
The efficacy of STRATTERA Capsules was established in seven clinical trials in outpatients with ADHD : four 6 to 9 - week trials in pediatric patients ( ages 6 to 18 ) , two 10 - week trial in adults , and one maintenance trial in pediatrics ( ages 6 to 15 ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
1 . 2 Diagnostic Considerations A diagnosis of ADHD ( DSM – IV ) implies the presence of hyperactive – impulsive or inattentive symptoms that cause impairment and that were present before age 7 years .
The symptoms must be persistent , must be more severe than is typically observed in individuals at a comparable level of development , must cause clinically significant impairment , e . g . , in social , academic , or occupational functioning , and must be present in 2 or more settings , e . g . , school ( or work ) and at home .
The symptoms must not be better accounted for by another mental disorder .
The specific etiology of ADHD is unknown , and there is no single diagnostic test .
Adequate diagnosis requires the use not only of medical but also of special psychological , educational , and social resources .
Learning may or may not be impaired .
The diagnosis must be based upon a complete history and evaluation of the patient and not solely on the presence of the required number of DSM – IV characteristics .
For the Inattentive Type , at least 6 of the following symptoms must have persisted for at least 6 months : lack of attention to details / careless mistakes , lack of sustained attention , poor listener , failure to follow through on tasks , poor organization , avoids tasks requiring sustained mental effort , loses things , easily distracted , forgetful .
For the Hyperactive – Impulsive Type , at least 6 of the following symptoms must have persisted for at least 6 months : fidgeting / squirming , leaving seat , inappropriate running / climbing , difficulty with quiet activities , “ on the go , ” excessive talking , blurting answers , can ’ t wait turn , intrusive .
For a Combined Type diagnosis , both inattentive and hyperactive – impulsive criteria must be met .
1 . 3 Need for Comprehensive Treatment Program STRATTERA is indicated as an integral part of a total treatment program for ADHD that may include other measures ( psychological , educational , social ) for patients with this syndrome .
Drug treatment may not be indicated for all patients with this syndrome .
Drug treatment is not intended for use in the patient who exhibits symptoms secondary to environmental factors and / or other primary psychiatric disorders , including psychosis .
Appropriate educational placement is essential in children and adolescents with this diagnosis and psychosocial intervention is often helpful .
When remedial measures alone are insufficient , the decision to prescribe drug treatment medication will depend upon the physician ’ s assessment of the chronicity and severity of the patient ’ s symptoms .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Initial , Target and Maximum Daily Dose ( 2 . 1 ) Body Weight Initial Daily Dose Target Total Daily Dose Maximum Total Daily Dose Children and adolescents up to 70 kg 0 . 5 mg / kg 1 . 2 mg / kg 1 . 4 mg / kg Children and adolescents over 70 kg and adults 40 mg 80 mg 100 mg Dosing adjustment — Hepatic Impairment , Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitor , and in patients known to be CYP2D6 poor metabolizers ( PMs ) .
( 2 . 4 , 12 . 3 ) 2 . 1 Acute Treatment Dosing of children and adolescents up to 70 kg body weight — STRATTERA should be initiated at a total daily dose of approximately 0 . 5 mg / kg and increased after a minimum of 3 days to a target total daily dose of approximately 1 . 2 mg / kg administered either as a single daily dose in the morning or as evenly divided doses in the morning and late afternoon / early evening .
No additional benefit has been demonstrated for doses higher than 1 . 2 mg / kg / day [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The total daily dose in children and adolescents should not exceed 1 . 4 mg / kg or 100 mg , whichever is less .
Dosing of children and adolescents over 70 kg body weight and adults — STRATTERA should be initiated at a total daily dose of 40 mg and increased after a minimum of 3 days to a target total daily dose of approximately 80 mg administered either as a single daily dose in the morning or as evenly divided doses in the morning and late afternoon / early evening .
After 2 to 4 additional weeks , the dose may be increased to a maximum of 100 mg in patients who have not achieved an optimal response .
There are no data that support increased effectiveness at higher doses [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The maximum recommended total daily dose in children and adolescents over 70 kg and adults is 100 mg .
2 . 2 Maintenance / Extended Treatment It is generally agreed that pharmacological treatment of ADHD may be needed for extended periods .
The benefit of maintaining pediatric patients ( ages 6 - 15 years ) with ADHD on STRATTERA after achieving a response in a dose range of 1 . 2 to 1 . 8 mg / kg / day was demonstrated in a controlled trial .
Patients assigned to STRATTERA in the maintenance phase were generally continued on the same dose used to achieve a response in the open label phase .
The physician who elects to use STRATTERA for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long - term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 3 General Dosing Information STRATTERA may be taken with or without food .
STRATTERA can be discontinued without being tapered .
STRATTERA capsules are not intended to be opened , they should be taken whole [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 . 6 ) ] .
The safety of single doses over 120 mg and total daily doses above 150 mg have not been systematically evaluated .
2 . 4 Dosing in Specific Populations Dosing adjustment for hepatically impaired patients — For those ADHD patients who have hepatic insufficiency ( HI ) , dosage adjustment is recommended as follows : For patients with moderate HI ( Child – Pugh Class B ) , initial and target doses should be reduced to 50 % of the normal dose ( for patients without HI ) .
For patients with severe HI ( Child – Pugh Class C ) , initial dose and target doses should be reduced to 25 % of normal [ see Use In Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Dosing adjustment for use with a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor or in patients who are known to be CYP2D6 PMs — In children and adolescents up to 70 kg body weight administered strong CYP2D6 inhibitors , e . g . , paroxetine , fluoxetine , and quinidine , or in patients who are known to be CYP2D6 PMs , STRATTERA should be initiated at 0 . 5 mg / kg / day and only increased to the usual target dose of 1 . 2 mg / kg / day if symptoms fail to improve after 4 weeks and the initial dose is well tolerated .
In children and adolescents over 70 kg body weight and adults administered strong CYP2D6 inhibitors , e . g . , paroxetine , fluoxetine , and quinidine , STRATTERA should be initiated at 40 mg / day and only increased to the usual target dose of 80 mg / day if symptoms fail to improve after 4 weeks and the initial dose is well tolerated .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Each capsule contains atomoxetine HCl equivalent to 10 mg ( Opaque White , Opaque White ) , 18 mg ( Gold , Opaque White ) , 25 mg ( Opaque Blue , Opaque White ) , 40 mg ( Opaque Blue , Opaque Blue ) , 60 mg ( Opaque Blue , Gold ) , 80 mg ( Opaque Brown , Opaque White ) , or 100 mg ( Opaque Brown , Opaque Brown ) of atomoxetine .

( 3 , 11 , 16 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Hypersensitivity to atomoxetine or other constituents of product .
( 4 . 1 ) • STRATTERA use within 2 weeks after discontinuing MAOI or other drugs that affect brain monoamine concentrations .
( 4 . 2 , 7 . 1 ) • Narrow Angle Glaucoma .
( 4 . 3 ) 4 . 1 Hypersensitivity STRATTERA is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to atomoxetine or other constituents of the product [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
4 . 2 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors ( MAOI ) STRATTERA should not be taken with an MAOI , or within 2 weeks after discontinuing an MAOI .
Treatment with an MAOI should not be initiated within 2 weeks after discontinuing STRATTERA .
With other drugs that affect brain monoamine concentrations , there have been reports of serious , sometimes fatal reactions ( including hyperthermia , rigidity , myoclonus , autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs , and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma ) when taken in combination with an MAOI .
Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome .
Such reactions may occur when these drugs are given concurrently or in close proximity [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
4 . 3 Narrow Angle Glaucoma In clinical trials , STRATTERA use was associated with an increased risk of mydriasis and therefore its use is not recommended in patients with narrow angle glaucoma .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Suicidal Ideation - Monitor for suicidality , clinical worsening , and unusual changes in behavior .
( 5 . 1 ) • Severe Liver Injury - Should be discontinued and not restarted in patients with jaundice or laboratory evidence of liver injury .
( 5 . 2 ) • Serious Cardiovascular Events - Sudden death , stroke and myocardial infarction have been reported in association with atomoxetine treatment .
Patients should have a careful history and physical exam to assess for presence of cardiovascular disease .
STRATTERA generally should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities , cardiomyopathy , serious heart rhythm abnormalities , or other serious cardiac problems that may place them at increased vulnerability to its noradrenergic effects .
Consideration should be given to not using STRATTERA in adults with clinically significant cardiac abnormalities .
( 5 . 3 ) • Emergent Cardiovascular Symptoms - Patients should undergo prompt cardiac evaluation .
( 5 . 3 ) • Effects on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate - Can increase blood pressure and heart rate ; orthostasis , syncope and Raynaud ’ s phenomenon may occur .
Use with caution in patients with hypertension , tachycardia , or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease .
( 5 . 4 ) .
• Emergent Psychotic or Manic Symptoms - Consider discontinuing treatment if such new symptoms occur .
( 5 . 5 ) • Bipolar Disorder - Screen patients to avoid possible induction of a mixed / manic episode .
( 5 . 6 ) • Aggressive behavior or hostility should be monitored .
( 5 . 7 ) • Possible allergic reactions , including angioneurotic edema , urticaria , and rash .
( 5 . 8 ) • Effects on Urine Outflow - Urinary hesitancy and retention may occur .

( 5 . 13 ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] 5 . 1 Suicidal Ideation STRATTERA increased the risk of suicidal ideation in short – term studies in children and adolescents with Attention – Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) .
Pooled analyses of short – term ( 6 to 18 weeks ) placebo – controlled trials of STRATTERA in children and adolescents have revealed a greater risk of suicidal ideation early during treatment in those receiving STRATTERA .
There were a total of 12 trials ( 11 in ADHD and 1 in enuresis ) involving over 2200 patients ( including 1357 patients receiving STRATTERA and 851 receiving placebo ) .
The average risk of suicidal ideation in patients receiving STRATTERA was 0 . 4 % ( 5 / 1357 patients ) , compared to none in placebo – treated patients .
There was 1 suicide attempt among these approximately 2200 patients , occurring in a patient treated with STRATTERA .
No suicides occurred in these trials .
All reactions occurred in children 12 years of age or younger .
All reactions occurred during the first month of treatment .
It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal ideation in pediatric patients extends to longer – term use .
A similar analysis in adult patients treated with STRATTERA for either ADHD or major depressive disorder ( MDD ) did not reveal an increased risk of suicidal ideation or behavior in association with the use of STRATTERA .
All pediatric patients being treated with STRATTERA should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening , suicidality , and unusual changes in behavior , especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy , or at times of dose changes , either increases or decreases .
The following symptoms have been reported with STRATTERA : anxiety , agitation , panic attacks , insomnia , irritability , hostility , aggressiveness , impulsivity , akathisia ( psychomotor restlessness ) , hypomania and mania .
Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established , there is a concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality .
Thus , patients being treated with STRATTERA should be observed for the emergence of such symptoms .
Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen , including possibly discontinuing the medication , in patients who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to emerging suicidality , especially if these symptoms are severe or abrupt in onset , or were not part of the patient ’ s presenting symptoms .
Families and caregivers of pediatric patients being treated with STRATTERA should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation , irritability , unusual changes in behavior , and the other symptoms described above , as well as the emergence of suicidality , and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers .
Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers .
5 . 2 Severe Liver Injury Postmarketing reports indicate that STRATTERA can cause severe liver injury .
Although no evidence of liver injury was detected in clinical trials of about 6000 patients , there have been rare cases of clinically significant liver injury that were considered probably or possibly related to STRATTERA use in postmarketing experience .
Because of probable underreporting , it is impossible to provide an accurate estimate of the true incidence of these reactions .
Reported cases of liver injury occurred within 120 days of initiation of atomoxetine in the majority of cases and some patients presented with markedly elevated liver enzymes [ > 20 X upper limit of normal ( ULN ) ] , and jaundice with significantly elevated bilirubin levels ( > 2 X ULN ) , followed by recovery upon atomoxetine discontinuation .
In one patient , liver injury , manifested by elevated hepatic enzymes up to 40 X upper limit of normal ULN and jaundice with bilirubin up to 12 X ULN , recurred upon rechallenge , and was followed by recovery upon drug discontinuation , providing evidence that STRATTERA likely caused the liver injury .
Such reactions may occur several months after therapy is started , but laboratory abnormalities may continue to worsen for several weeks after drug is stopped .
The patient described above recovered from his liver injury , and did not require a liver transplant .
However , severe liver injury due to any drug may potentially progress to acute liver failure resulting in death or the need for a liver transplant .
STRATTERA should be discontinued in patients with jaundice or laboratory evidence of liver injury , and should not be restarted .
Laboratory testing to determine liver enzyme levels should be done upon the first symptom or sign of liver dysfunction ( e . g . , pruritus , dark urine , jaundice , right upper quadrant tenderness , or unexplained “ flu like ” symptoms ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 12 ) ; Patient Counseling Information ( 17 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 3 Serious Cardiovascular Events Sudden Death and Pre - existing Structural Cardiac Abnormalities or Other Serious Heart Problems Children and Adolescents — Sudden death has been reported in association with atomoxetine treatment at usual doses in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems .
Although some serious heart problems alone carry an increased risk of sudden death , atomoxetine generally should not be used in children or adolescents with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities , cardiomyopathy , serious heart rhythm abnormalities , or other serious cardiac problems that may place them at increased vulnerability to the noradrenergic effects of atomoxetine .
Adults — Sudden deaths , stroke , and myocardial infarction have been reported in adults taking atomoxetine at usual doses for ADHD .
Although the role of atomoxetine in these adult cases is also unknown , adults have a greater likelihood than children of having serious structural cardiac abnormalities , cardiomyopathy , serious heart rhythm abnormalities , coronary artery disease , or other serious cardiac problems .
Consideration should be given to not treating adults with clinically significant cardiac abnormalities .
Assessing Cardiovascular Status in Patients being Treated with Atomoxetine Children , adolescents , or adults who are being considered for treatment with atomoxetine should have a careful history ( including assessment for a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia ) and physical exam to assess for the presence of cardiac disease , and should receive further cardiac evaluation if findings suggest such disease ( e . g . , electrocardiogram and echocardiogram ) .
Patients who develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain , unexplained syncope , or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease during atomoxetine treatment should undergo a prompt cardiac evaluation .
5 . 4 Effects on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate STRATTERA should be used with caution in patients with hypertension , tachycardia , or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease because it can increase blood pressure and heart rate .
Pulse and blood pressure should be measured at baseline , following STRATTERA dose increases , and periodically while on therapy .
In pediatric placebo – controlled trials , STRATTERA – treated subjects experienced a mean increase in heart rate of about 6 beats / minute compared with placebo subjects .
At the final study visit before drug discontinuation , 2 . 5 % ( 36 / 1434 ) of STRATTERA – treated subjects had heart rate increases of at least 25 beats / minute and a heart rate of at least 110 beats / minute , compared with 0 . 2 % ( 2 / 850 ) of placebo subjects .
There were 1 . 1 % ( 15 / 1417 ) pediatric STRATTERA - treated subjects with a heart rate increase of at least 25 beats / minute and a heart rate of at least 110 beats / minute on more than one occasion .
Tachycardia was identified as an adverse event for 0 . 3 % ( 5 / 1597 ) of these pediatric subjects compared with 0 % ( 0 / 934 ) of placebo subjects .
The mean heart rate increase in extensive metabolizer ( EM ) patients was 5 . 0 beats / minute , and in poor metabolizer ( PM ) patients 9 . 4 beats / minute .
STRATTERA – treated pediatric subjects experienced mean increases of about 1 . 6 and 2 . 4 mm Hg in systolic and diastolic blood pressures , respectively compared with placebo .
At the final study visit before drug discontinuation , 4 . 8 % ( 59 / 1226 ) of STRATTERA – treated pediatric subjects had high systolic blood pressure measurements compared with 3 . 5 % ( 26 / 748 ) of placebo subjects .
High systolic blood pressures were measured on 2 or more occasions in 4 . 4 % ( 54 / 1226 ) of STRATTERA – treated subjects and 1 . 9 % ( 14 / 748 ) of placebo subjects .
At the final study visit before drug discontinuation , 4 . 0 % ( 50 / 1262 ) of STRATTERA – treated pediatric subjects had high diastolic blood pressure measurements compared with 1 . 1 % ( 8 / 759 ) of placebo subjects .
High diastolic blood pressures were measured on 2 or more occasions in 3 . 5 % ( 44 / 1262 ) of STRATTERA – treated subjects and 0 . 5 % ( 4 / 759 ) of placebo subjects .
( High systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements were defined as those exceeding the 95 th percentile , stratified by age , gender , and height percentile – National High Blood Pressure Education Working Group on Hypertension Control in Children and Adolescents . )
In adult placebo – controlled trials , STRATTERA – treated subjects experienced a mean increase in heart rate of 5 beats / minute compared with placebo subjects .
Tachycardia was identified as an adverse event for 1 . 5 % ( 8 / 540 ) of these adult atomoxetine subjects compared with 0 . 5 % ( 2 / 402 ) of placebo subjects .
STRATTERA – treated adult subjects experienced mean increases in systolic ( about 2 . 0 mm Hg ) and diastolic ( about 1 . 0 mm Hg ) blood pressures compared with placebo .
At the final study visit before drug discontinuation , 2 . 2 % ( 11 / 510 ) of STRATTERA – treated adult subjects had systolic blood pressure measurements ≥ 150 mm Hg compared with 1 . 0 % ( 4 / 393 ) of placebo subjects .
At the final study visit before drug discontinuation , 0 . 4 % ( 2 / 510 ) of STRATTERA – treated adult subjects had diastolic blood pressure measurements ≥ 100 mm Hg compared with 0 . 5 % ( 2 / 393 ) of placebo subjects .
No adult subject had a high systolic or diastolic blood pressure detected on more than one occasion .
Orthostatic hypotension and syncope have been reported in patients taking STRATTERA .
In child and adolescent trials , 0 . 2 % ( 12 / 5596 ) of STRATTERA - treated patients experienced orthostatic hypotension and 0 . 8 % ( 46 / 5596 ) experienced syncope .
In short - term child and adolescent controlled trials , 1 . 8 % ( 6 / 340 ) of STRATTERA – treated patients experienced orthostatic hypotension compared with 0 . 5 % ( 1 / 207 ) of placebo - treated patients .
Syncope was not reported during short - term child and adolescent placebo - controlled ADHD trials .
STRATTERA should be used with caution in any condition that may predispose patients to hypotension , or conditions associated with abrupt heart rate or blood pressure changes .
Peripheral vascular effects — There have been spontaneous postmarketing reports of Raynaud ’ s phenomenon ( new onset and exacerbation of preexisting condition ) .
5 . 5 Emergence of New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms Treatment emergent psychotic or manic symptoms , e . g . , hallucinations , delusional thinking , or mania in children and adolescents without a prior history of psychotic illness or mania can be caused by atomoxetine at usual doses .
If such symptoms occur , consideration should be given to a possible causal role of atomoxetine , and discontinuation of treatment should be considered .
In a pooled analysis of multiple short – term , placebo – controlled studies , such symptoms occurred in about 0 . 2 % ( 4 patients with reactions out of 1939 exposed to atomoxetine for several weeks at usual doses ) of atomoxetine – treated patients compared to 0 out of 1056 placebo – treated patients .
5 . 6 Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder In general , particular care should be taken in treating ADHD in patients with comorbid bipolar disorder because of concern for possible induction of a mixed / manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorder .
Whether any of the symptoms described above represent such a conversion is unknown .
However , prior to initiating treatment with STRATTERA , patients with comorbid depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if they are at risk for bipolar disorder ; such screening should include a detailed psychiatric history , including a family history of suicide , bipolar disorder , and depression .
5 . 7 Aggressive Behavior or Hostility Patients beginning treatment for ADHD should be monitored for the appearance or worsening of aggressive behavior or hostility .
Aggressive behavior or hostility is often observed in children and adolescents with ADHD .
In short – term controlled clinical trials , 21 / 1308 ( 1 . 6 % ) of atomoxetine patients versus 9 / 806 ( 1 . 1 % ) of placebo – treated patients spontaneously reported treatment emergent hostility - related adverse events .
Although this is not conclusive evidence that STRATTERA causes aggressive behavior or hostility , these behaviors were more frequently observed in clinical trials among children and adolescents treated with STRATTERA compared to placebo ( overall risk ratio of 1 . 33 [ 95 % C . I . 0 . 67 – 2 . 64 – not statistically significant ] ) .
5 . 8 Allergic Events Although uncommon , allergic reactions , including angioneurotic edema , urticaria , and rash , have been reported in patients taking STRATTERA .
5 . 9 Effects on Urine Outflow from the Bladder In adult ADHD controlled trials , the rates of urinary retention ( 1 . 7 % , 9 / 540 ) and urinary hesitation ( 5 . 6 % , 30 / 540 ) were increased among atomoxetine subjects compared with placebo subjects ( 0 % , 0 / 402 ; 0 . 5 % , 2 / 402 , respectively ) .
Two adult atomoxetine subjects and no placebo subjects discontinued from controlled clinical trials because of urinary retention .
A complaint of urinary retention or urinary hesitancy should be considered potentially related to atomoxetine .
5 . 10 Priapism Rare postmarketing cases of priapism , defined as painful and nonpainful penile erection lasting more than 4 hours , have been reported for pediatric and adult patients treated with STRATTERA .
The erections resolved in cases in which follow - up information was available , some following discontinuation of STRATTERA .
Prompt medical attention is required in the event of suspected priapism .
5 . 11 Effects on Growth Data on the long – term effects of STRATTERA on growth come from open – label studies , and weight and height changes are compared to normative population data .
In general , the weight and height gain of pediatric patients treated with STRATTERA lags behind that predicted by normative population data for about the first 9 – 12 months of treatment .
Subsequently , weight gain rebounds and at about 3 years of treatment , patients treated with STRATTERA have gained 17 . 9 kg on average , 0 . 5 kg more than predicted by their baseline data .
After about 12 months , gain in height stabilizes , and at 3 years , patients treated with STRATTERA have gained 19 . 4 cm on average , 0 . 4 cm less than predicted by their baseline data ( see Figure 1 below ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] This growth pattern was generally similar regardless of pubertal status at the time of treatment initiation .
Patients who were pre – pubertal at the start of treatment ( girls ≤ 8 years old , boys ≤ 9 years old ) gained an average of 2 . 1 kg and 1 . 2 cm less than predicted after three years .
Patients who were pubertal ( girls > 8 to ≤ 13 years old , boys > 9 to ≤ 14 years old ) or late pubertal ( girls > 13 years old , boys > 14 years old ) had average weight and height gains that were close to or exceeded those predicted after three years of treatment .
Growth followed a similar pattern in both extensive and poor metabolizers ( EMs , PMs ) .
PMs treated for at least two years gained an average of 2 . 4 kg and 1 . 1 cm less than predicted , while EMs gained an average of 0 . 2 kg and 0 . 4 cm less than predicted .
In short – term controlled studies ( up to 9 weeks ) , STRATTERA – treated patients lost an average of 0 . 4 kg and gained an average of 0 . 9 cm , compared to a gain of 1 . 5 kg and 1 . 1 cm in the placebo – treated patients .
In a fixed – dose controlled trial , 1 . 3 % , 7 . 1 % , 19 . 3 % , and 29 . 1 % of patients lost at least 3 . 5 % of their body weight in the placebo , 0 . 5 , 1 . 2 , and 1 . 8 mg / kg / day dose groups .
Growth should be monitored during treatment with STRATTERA .
5 . 12 Laboratory Tests Routine laboratory tests are not required .
CYP2D6 metabolism — Poor metabolizers ( PMs ) of CYP2D6 have a 10 – fold higher AUC and a 5 – fold higher peak concentration to a given dose of STRATTERA compared with extensive metabolizers ( EMs ) .
Approximately 7 % of a Caucasian population are PMs .
Laboratory tests are available to identify CYP2D6 PMs .
The blood levels in PMs are similar to those attained by taking strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 .
The higher blood levels in PMs lead to a higher rate of some adverse effects of STRATTERA [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 13 Concomitant Use of Potent CYP2D6 Inhibitors or Use in patients who are known to be CYP2D6 PMs Atomoxetine is primarily metabolized by the CYP2D6 pathway to 4 – hydroxyatomoxetine .
Dosage adjustment of STRATTERA may be necessary when coadministered with potent CYP2D6 inhibitors ( e . g . , paroxetine , fluoxetine , and quinidine ) or when administered to CYP2D6 PMs .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 5 % and at least twice the incidence of placebo patients ) • Child and Adolescent Clinical Trials - Nausea , vomiting , fatigue , decreased appetite , abdominal pain , and somnolence .
( 6 . 1 ) • Adult Clinical Trials - Constipation , dry mouth , nausea , fatigue , decreased appetite , insomnia , erectile dysfunction , urinary hesitation and / or urinary retention and / or dysuria , dysmenorrhea , and hot flush .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Eli Lilly and Company at 1 - 800 - LillyRx ( 1 - 800 - 545 - 5979 ) or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch 6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience STRATTERA was administered to 5382 children or adolescent patients with ADHD and 1007 adults with ADHD in clinical studies .
During the ADHD clinical trials , 1625 children and adolescent patients were treated for longer than 1 year and 2529 children and adolescent patients were treated for over 6 months .
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Child and Adolescent Clinical Trials Reasons for discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions in child and adolescent clinical trials — In acute child and adolescent placebo – controlled trials , 3 . 0 % ( 48 / 1613 ) of atomoxetine subjects and 1 . 4 % ( 13 / 945 ) placebo subjects discontinued for adverse reactions .
For all studies , ( including open – label and long – term studies ) , 6 . 3 % of extensive metabolizer ( EM ) patients and 11 . 2 % of poor metabolizer ( PM ) patients discontinued because of an adverse reaction .
Among STRATTERA – treated patients , irritability ( 0 . 3 % , N = 5 ) ; somnolence ( 0 . 3 % , N = 5 ) ; aggression ( 0 . 2 % , N = 4 ) ; nausea ( 0 . 2 % , N = 4 ) ; vomiting ( 0 . 2 % , N = 4 ) ; abdominal pain ( 0 . 2 % , N = 4 ) ; constipation ( 0 . 1 % , N = 2 ) ; fatigue ( 0 . 1 % , N = 2 ) ; feeling abnormal ( 0 . 1 % , N = 2 ) ; and headache ( 0 . 1 % , N = 2 ) were the reasons for discontinuation reported by more than 1 patient .
Seizures — STRATTERA has not been systematically evaluated in pediatric patients with seizure disorder as these patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product ’ s premarket testing .
In the clinical development program , seizures were reported in 0 . 2 % ( 12 / 5073 ) of children whose average age was 10 years ( range 6 to 16 years ) .
In these clinical trials , the seizure risk among poor metabolizers was 0 . 3 % ( 1 / 293 ) compared to 0 . 2 % ( 11 / 4741 ) for extensive metabolizers .
Commonly observed adverse reactions in acute child and adolescent , placebo – controlled trials — Commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of STRATTERA ( incidence of 2 % or greater ) and not observed at an equivalent incidence among placebo – treated patients ( STRATTERA incidence greater than placebo ) are listed in Table 1 .
Results were similar in the BID and the QD trial except as shown in Table 2 , which shows both BID and QD results for selected adverse reactions based on statistically significant Breslow - Day tests .
The most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with STRATTERA ( incidence of 5 % or greater and at least twice the incidence in placebo patients , for either BID or QD dosing ) were : nausea , vomiting , fatigue , decreased appetite , abdominal pain , and somnolence ( see Tables 1 and 2 ) .

Adult Clinical Trials Reasons for discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions in acute adult placebo – controlled trials — In the acute adult placebo – controlled trials , 11 . 3 % ( 61 / 541 ) atomoxetine subjects and 3 . 0 % ( 12 / 405 ) placebo subjects discontinued for adverse reactions .
Among STRATTERA – treated patients , insomnia ( 0 . 9 % , N = 5 ) ; nausea ( 0 . 9 % , N = 5 ) ; chest pain ( 0 . 6 % , N = 3 ) ; fatigue ( 0 . 6 % , N = 3 ) ; anxiety ( 0 . 4 % , N = 2 ) ; erectile dysfunction ( 0 . 4 % , N = 2 ) ; mood swings ( 0 . 4 % , N = 2 ) ; nervousness ( 0 . 4 % , N = 2 ) ; palpitations ( 0 . 4 % , N = 2 ) ; and urinary retention ( 0 . 4 % , N = 2 ) were the reasons for discontinuation reported by more than 1 patient .
Seizures — STRATTERA has not been systematically evaluated in adult patients with a seizure disorder as these patients were excluded from clinical studies during the product ’ s premarket testing .
In the clinical development program , seizures were reported on 0 . 1 % ( 1 / 748 ) of adult patients .
In these clinical trials , no poor metabolizers ( 0 / 43 ) reported seizures compared to 0 . 1 % ( 1 / 705 ) for extensive metabolizers .
Commonly observed adverse reactions in acute adult placebo – controlled trials — Commonly observed adverse reactions associated with the use of STRATTERA ( incidence of 2 % or greater ) and not observed at an equivalent incidence among placebo – treated patients ( STRATTERA incidence greater than placebo ) are listed in Table 3 .
The most commonly observed adverse reactions in patients treated with STRATTERA ( incidence of 5 % or greater and at least twice the incidence in placebo patients ) were : constipation , dry mouth , nausea , fatigue , decreased appetite , insomnia , erectile dysfunction , urinary hesitation and / or urinary retention and / or dysuria , dysmenorrhea , and hot flush ( see Table 3 ) .

[ 2 ] Based on total number of females ( STRATTERA , N = 214 ; placebo , N = 142 ) .
Male and female sexual dysfunction — Atomoxetine appears to impair sexual function in some patients .
Changes in sexual desire , sexual performance , and sexual satisfaction are not well assessed in most clinical trials because they need special attention and because patients and physicians may be reluctant to discuss them .
Accordingly , estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in product labeling are likely to underestimate the actual incidence .
Table 3 above displays the incidence of sexual side effects reported by at least 2 % of adult patients taking STRATTERA in placebo - controlled trials .
There are no adequate and well – controlled studies examining sexual dysfunction with STRATTERA treatment .
While it is difficult to know the precise risk of sexual dysfunction associated with the use of STRATTERA , physicians should routinely inquire about such possible side effects .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Spontaneous Reports The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of STRATTERA .
Unless otherwise specified , these adverse reactions have occurred in adults and children and adolescents .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Cardiovascular system — QT prolongation , syncope .
General disorders and administration site conditions — Lethargy .
Nervous system disorders — Hypoaesthesia ; paraesthesia in children and adolescents ; sensory disturbances .
Seizures — Seizures have been reported in the postmarketing period .
The postmarketing seizure cases include patients with pre – existing seizure disorders and those with identified risk factors for seizures , as well as patients with neither a history of nor identified risk factors for seizures .
The exact relationship between STRATTERA and seizures is difficult to evaluate due to uncertainty about the background risk of seizures in ADHD patients .
Urogenital system — Male pelvic pain ; urinary hesitation in children and adolescents ; urinary retention in children and adolescents .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors .
( 4 . 2 , 7 . 1 ) • CYP2D6 Inhibitors – Concomitant use may increase atomoxetine steady – state plasma concentrations in EMs .
( 7 . 2 ) • Pressor Agents – Possible effects on blood pressure .
( 7 . 3 ) • Albuterol ( or other beta2 agonists ) – Action of albuterol on cardiovascular system can be potentiated .
( 7 . 4 ) 7 . 1 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors With other drugs that affect brain monoamine concentrations , there have been reports of serious , sometimes fatal reactions ( including hyperthermia , rigidity , myoclonus , autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs , and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma ) when taken in combination with an MAOI .
Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome .
Such reactions may occur when these drugs are given concurrently or in close proximity [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 2 ) ] .
7 . 2 Effect of CYP2D6 Inhibitors on Atomoxetine In extensive metabolizers ( EMs ) , inhibitors of CYP2D6 ( e . g . , paroxetine , fluoxetine , and quinidine ) increase atomoxetine steady – state plasma concentrations to exposures similar to those observed in poor metabolizers ( PMs ) .
In EM individuals treated with paroxetine or fluoxetine , the AUC of atomoxetine is approximately 6 – to 8 – fold and Css , max is about 3 – to 4 – fold greater than atomoxetine alone .
In vitro studies suggest that coadministration of cytochrome P450 inhibitors to PMs will not increase the plasma concentrations of atomoxetine .
7 . 3 Pressor Agents Because of possible effects on blood pressure , STRATTERA should be used cautiously with pressor agents ( e . g . , dopamine , dobutamine ) .
7 . 4 Albuterol STRATTERA should be administered with caution to patients being treated with systemically – administered ( oral or intravenous ) albuterol ( or other beta2 agonists ) because the action of albuterol on the cardiovascular system can be potentiated resulting in increases in heart rate and blood pressure .
Albuterol ( 600 mcg iv over 2 hours ) induced increases in heart rate and blood pressure .
These effects were potentiated by atomoxetine ( 60 mg BID for 5 days ) and were most marked after the initial coadministration of albuterol and atomoxetine .
However , these effects on heart rate and blood pressure were not seen in another study after the coadministration with inhaled dose of albuterol ( 200 - 800 mcg ) and atomoxetine ( 80 mg QD for 5 days ) in 21 healthy Asian subjects who were excluded for poor metabolizer status .
7 . 5 Effect of Atomoxetine on P450 Enzymes Atomoxetine did not cause clinically important inhibition or induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes , including CYP1A2 , CYP3A , CYP2D6 , and CYP2C9 .
CYP3A Substrate ( e . g . , Midazolam ) — Coadministration of STRATTERA ( 60 mg BID for 12 days ) with midazolam , a model compound for CYP3A4 metabolized drugs ( single dose of 5 mg ) , resulted in 15 % increase in AUC of midazolam .
No dose adjustment is recommended for drugs metabolized by CYP3A .
CYP2D6 Substrate ( e . g . , Desipramine ) — Coadministration of STRATTERA ( 40 or 60 mg BID for 13 days ) with desipramine , a model compound for CYP2D6 metabolized drugs ( single dose of 50 mg ) , did not alter the pharmacokinetics of desipramine .
No dose adjustment is recommended for drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 .
7 . 6 Alcohol Consumption of ethanol with STRATTERA did not change the intoxicating effects of ethanol .
7 . 7 Methylphenidate Coadministration of methylphenidate with STRATTERA did not increase cardiovascular effects beyond those seen with methylphenidate alone .
7 . 8 Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein In vitro drug – displacement studies were conducted with atomoxetine and other highly – bound drugs at therapeutic concentrations .
Atomoxetine did not affect the binding of warfarin , acetylsalicylic acid , phenytoin , or diazepam to human albumin .
Similarly , these compounds did not affect the binding of atomoxetine to human albumin .
7 . 9 Drugs that Affect Gastric pH Drugs that elevate gastric pH ( magnesium hydroxide / aluminum hydroxide , omeprazole ) had no effect on STRATTERA bioavailability .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy / Lactation – Pregnant or nursing women should not use unless potential benefit justifies potential risk to fetus or infant .
( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) • Hepatic Insufficiency – Increased exposure ( AUC ) to atomoxetine than with normal subjects in EM subjects with moderate ( Child – Pugh Class B ) ( 2 – fold increase ) and severe ( Child – Pugh Class C ) ( 4 – fold increase ) .
( 8 . 6 ) • Renal Insufficiency – Higher systemic exposure to atomoxetine than healthy subjects for EM subjects with end stage renal disease - no difference when exposure corrected for mg / kg dose .
( 8 . 7 ) • Patients with Concomitant Illness – Does not worsen tics in patients with ADHD and comorbid Tourette ’ s Disorder .
( 8 . 10 ) • Patients with Concomitant Illness - Does not worsen anxiety in patients with ADHD and comorbid Anxiety Disorders .
( 8 . 10 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C — Pregnant rabbits were treated with up to 100 mg / kg / day of atomoxetine by gavage throughout the period of organogenesis .
At this dose , in 1 of 3 studies , a decrease in live fetuses and an increase in early resorptions was observed .
Slight increases in the incidences of atypical origin of carotid artery and absent subclavian artery were observed .
These findings were observed at doses that caused slight maternal toxicity .
The no - effect dose for these findings was 30 mg / kg / day .
The 100 mg / kg dose is approximately 23 times the maximum human dose on a mg / m2 basis ; plasma levels ( AUC ) of atomoxetine at this dose in rabbits are estimated to be 3 . 3 times ( extensive metabolizers ) or 0 . 4 times ( poor metabolizers ) those in humans receiving the maximum human dose .
Rats were treated with up to approximately 50 mg / kg / day of atomoxetine ( approximately 6 times the maximum human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) in the diet from 2 weeks ( females ) or 10 weeks ( males ) prior to mating through the periods of organogenesis and lactation .
In 1 of 2 studies , decreases in pup weight and pup survival were observed .
The decreased pup survival was also seen at 25 mg / kg ( but not at 13 mg / kg ) .
In a study in which rats were treated with atomoxetine in the diet from 2 weeks ( females ) or 10 weeks ( males ) prior to mating throughout the period of organogenesis , a decrease in fetal weight ( female only ) and an increase in the incidence of incomplete ossification of the vertebral arch in fetuses were observed at 40 mg / kg / day ( approximately 5 times the maximum human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) but not at 20 mg / kg / day .
No adverse fetal effects were seen when pregnant rats were treated with up to 150 mg / kg / day ( approximately 17 times the maximum human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) by gavage throughout the period of organogenesis .
No adequate and well - controlled studies have been conducted in pregnant women .
STRATTERA should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
8 . 2 Labor and Delivery Parturition in rats was not affected by atomoxetine .
The effect of STRATTERA on labor and delivery in humans is unknown .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Atomoxetine and / or its metabolites were excreted in the milk of rats .
It is not known if atomoxetine is excreted in human milk .
Caution should be exercised if STRATTERA is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Anyone considering the use of STRATTERA in a child or adolescent must balance the potential risks with the clinical need [ see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The pharmacokinetics of atomoxetine in children and adolescents are similar to those in adults .
The safety , efficacy , and pharmacokinetics of STRATTERA in pediatric patients less than 6 years of age have not been evaluated .
A study was conducted in young rats to evaluate the effects of atomoxetine on growth and neurobehavioral and sexual development .
Rats were treated with 1 , 10 , or 50 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 2 , 2 , and 8 times , respectively , the maximum human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) of atomoxetine given by gavage from the early postnatal period ( Day 10 of age ) through adulthood .
Slight delays in onset of vaginal patency ( all doses ) and preputial separation ( 10 and 50 mg / kg ) , slight decreases in epididymal weight and sperm number ( 10 and 50 mg / kg ) , and a slight decrease in corpora lutea ( 50 mg / kg ) were seen , but there were no effects on fertility or reproductive performance .
A slight delay in onset of incisor eruption was seen at 50 mg / kg .
A slight increase in motor activity was seen on Day 15 ( males at 10 and 50 mg / kg and females at 50 mg / kg ) and on Day 30 ( females at 50 mg / kg ) but not on Day 60 of age .
There were no effects on learning and memory tests .
The significance of these findings to humans is unknown .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use The safety , efficacy and pharmacokinetics of STRATTERA in geriatric patients have not been evaluated .
8 . 6 Hepatic Insufficiency Atomoxetine exposure ( AUC ) is increased , compared with normal subjects , in EM subjects with moderate ( Child – Pugh Class B ) ( 2 – fold increase ) and severe ( Child – Pugh Class C ) ( 4 – fold increase ) hepatic insufficiency .
Dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic insufficiency [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Renal Insufficiency EM subjects with end stage renal disease had higher systemic exposure to atomoxetine than healthy subjects ( about a 65 % increase ) , but there was no difference when exposure was corrected for mg / kg dose .
STRATTERA can therefore be administered to ADHD patients with end stage renal disease or lesser degrees of renal insufficiency using the normal dosing regimen .
8 . 8 Gender Gender did not influence atomoxetine disposition .
8 . 9 Ethnic Origin Ethnic origin did not influence atomoxetine disposition ( except that PMs are more common in Caucasians ) .
8 . 10 Patients with Concomitant Illness Tics in patients with ADHD and comorbid Tourette ’ s Disorder — Atomoxetine administered in a flexible dose range of 0 . 5 to 1 . 5 mg / kg / day ( mean dose of 1 . 3 mg / kg / day ) and placebo were compared in 148 randomized pediatric ( age 7 - 17 years ) subjects with a DSM - IV diagnosis of ADHD and comorbid tic disorder in an 18 week , double - blind , placebo - controlled study in which the majority ( 80 % ) enrolled in this trial with Tourette ’ s Disorder ( Tourette ’ s Disorder : 116 subjects ; chronic motor tic disorder : 29 subjects ) .
A non - inferiority analysis revealed that STRATTERA did not worsen tics in these patients as determined by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale Total Score ( YGTSS ) .
Out of 148 patients who entered the acute treatment phase , 103 ( 69 . 6 % ) patients discontinued the study .
The primary reason for discontinuation in both the atomoxetine ( 38 of 76 patients , 50 . 0 % ) and placebo ( 45 of 72 patients , 62 . 5 % ) treatment groups was identified as lack of efficacy with most of the patients discontinuing at Week 12 .
This was the first visit where patients with a CGI - S ≥ 4 could also meet the criteria for “ clinical non - responder ” ( CGI - S remained the same or increased from study baseline ) and be eligible to enter an open - label extension study with atomoxetine .
Anxiety in patients with ADHD and comorbid Anxiety Disorders - In two post - marketing , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials , it has been demonstrated that treating patients with ADHD and comorbid anxiety disorders with STRATTERA does not worsen their anxiety .
In a 12 - week double - blind , placebo - controlled trial , 176 patients , aged 8 - 17 , who met DSM - IV criteria for ADHD and at least one of the anxiety disorders of separation anxiety disorder , generalized anxiety disorder or social phobia were randomized .
Following a 2 - week double - blind placebo lead - in , STRATTERA was initiated at 0 . 8 mg / kg / day with increase to a target dose of 1 . 2 mg / kg / day ( median dose 1 . 30 mg / kg / day + / - 0 . 29 mg / kg / day ) .
STRATTERA did not worsen anxiety in these patients as determined by the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale ( PARS ) .
Of the 158 patients who completed the double - blind placebo lead - in , 26 ( 16 % ) patients discontinued the study .
In a separate 16 - week , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial , 442 patients aged 18 - 65 , who met DSM - IV criteria for adult ADHD and social anxiety disorder ( 23 % of whom also had Generalized Anxiety Disorder ) were randomized .
Following a 2 - week double - blind placebo lead - in , STRATTERA was initiated at 40 mg / day to a maximum dose of 100 mg / day ( mean daily dose 83 mg / day + / - 19 . 5 mg / day ) .
STRATTERA did not worsen anxiety in these patients as determined by the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale ( LSAS ) .
Of the 436 patients who completed the double - blind placebo lead - in , 172 ( 39 . 4 % ) patients discontinued the study .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9 . 1 Controlled Substance STRATTERA is not a controlled substance .
9 . 2 Abuse In a randomized , double – blind , placebo – controlled , abuse – potential study in adults comparing effects of STRATTERA and placebo , STRATTERA was not associated with a pattern of response that suggested stimulant or euphoriant properties .
9 . 3 Dependence Clinical study data in over 2000 children , adolescents , and adults with ADHD and over 1200 adults with depression showed only isolated incidents of drug diversion or inappropriate self – administration associated with STRATTERA .
There was no evidence of symptom rebound or adverse reactions suggesting a drug – discontinuation or withdrawal syndrome .
Animal Experience — Drug discrimination studies in rats and monkeys showed inconsistent stimulus generalization between atomoxetine and cocaine .
10 OVERDOSAGE 10 . 1 Human Experience No fatal overdoses occurred in clinical trials .
There is limited clinical trial experience with STRATTERA overdose .
During postmarketing , there have been fatalities reported involving a mixed ingestion overdose of STRATTERA and at least one other drug .
There have been no reports of death involving overdose of STRATTERA alone , including intentional overdoses at amounts up to 1400 mg .
In some cases of overdose involving STRATTERA , seizures have been reported .
The most commonly reported symptoms accompanying acute and chronic overdoses of STRATTERA were somnolence , agitation , hyperactivity , abnormal behavior , and gastrointestinal symptoms .
Signs and symptoms consistent with mild to moderate sympathetic nervous system activation ( e . g . , mydriasis , tachycardia , dry mouth ) have also been observed .
Less commonly , there have been reports of QT prolongation and mental changes , including disorientation and hallucinations .
10 . 2 Management of Overdose An airway should be established .
Monitoring of cardiac and vital signs is recommended , along with appropriate symptomatic and supportive measures .
Gastric lavage may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion .
Activated charcoal may be useful in limiting absorption .
Because atomoxetine is highly protein – bound , dialysis is not likely to be useful in the treatment of overdose .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which atomoxetine produces its therapeutic effects in Attention – Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) is unknown , but is thought to be related to selective inhibition of the pre – synaptic norepinephrine transporter , as determined in ex vivo uptake and neurotransmitter depletion studies .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics An exposure – response analysis encompassing doses of atomoxetine ( 0 . 5 , 1 . 2 or 1 . 8 mg / kg / day ) or placebo demonstrated atomoxetine exposure correlates with efficacy as measured by the Attention – Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale – IV – Parent Version : Investigator administered and scored .
The exposure - efficacy relationship was similar to that observed between dose and efficacy with median exposures at the two highest doses resulting in near maximal changes from baseline [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Atomoxetine is well – absorbed after oral administration and is minimally affected by food .
It is eliminated primarily by oxidative metabolism through the cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ) enzymatic pathway and subsequent glucuronidation .
Atomoxetine has a half – life of about 5 hours .
A fraction of the population ( about 7 % of Caucasians and 2 % of African Americans ) are poor metabolizers ( PMs ) of CYP2D6 metabolized drugs .
These individuals have reduced activity in this pathway resulting in 10 – fold higher AUCs , 5 – fold higher peak plasma concentrations , and slower elimination ( plasma half – life of about 24 hours ) of atomoxetine compared with people with normal activity [ extensive metabolizers ( EMs ) ] .
Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine , paroxetine , and quinidine , cause similar increases in exposure .
The pharmacokinetics of atomoxetine have been evaluated in more than 400 children and adolescents in selected clinical trials , primarily using population pharmacokinetic studies .
Single – dose and steady – state individual pharmacokinetic data were also obtained in children , adolescents , and adults .
When doses were normalized to a mg / kg basis , similar half – life , Cmax , and AUC values were observed in children , adolescents , and adults .
Clearance and volume of distribution after adjustment for body weight were also similar .
Absorption and distribution — Atomoxetine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration , with absolute bioavailability of about 63 % in EMs and 94 % in PMs .
Maximal plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) are reached approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing .
STRATTERA can be administered with or without food .
Administration of STRATTERA with a standard high – fat meal in adults did not affect the extent of oral absorption of atomoxetine ( AUC ) , but did decrease the rate of absorption , resulting in a 37 % lower Cmax , and delayed Tmax by 3 hours .
In clinical trials with children and adolescents , administration of STRATTERA with food resulted in a 9 % lower Cmax .
The steady – state volume of distribution after intravenous administration is 0 . 85 L / kg indicating that atomoxetine distributes primarily into total body water .
Volume of distribution is similar across the patient weight range after normalizing for body weight .
At therapeutic concentrations , 98 % of atomoxetine in plasma is bound to protein , primarily albumin .
Metabolism and elimination — Atomoxetine is metabolized primarily through the CYP2D6 enzymatic pathway .
People with reduced activity in this pathway ( PMs ) have higher plasma concentrations of atomoxetine compared with people with normal activity ( EMs ) .
For PMs , AUC of atomoxetine is approximately 10 – fold and Css , max is about 5 – fold greater than EMs .
Laboratory tests are available to identify CYP2D6 PMs .
Coadministration of STRATTERA with potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 , such as fluoxetine , paroxetine , or quinidine , results in a substantial increase in atomoxetine plasma exposure , and dosing adjustment may be necessary [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 13 ) ] .
Atomoxetine did not inhibit or induce the CYP2D6 pathway .
The major oxidative metabolite formed , regardless of CYP2D6 status , is 4 – hydroxyatomoxetine , which is glucuronidated .
4 – Hydroxyatomoxetine is equipotent to atomoxetine as an inhibitor of the norepinephrine transporter but circulates in plasma at much lower concentrations ( 1 % of atomoxetine concentration in EMs and 0 . 1 % of atomoxetine concentration in PMs ) .
4 – Hydroxyatomoxetine is primarily formed by CYP2D6 , but in PMs , 4 – hydroxyatomoxetine is formed at a slower rate by several other cytochrome P450 enzymes .
N – Desmethylatomoxetine is formed by CYP2C19 and other cytochrome P450 enzymes , but has substantially less pharmacological activity compared with atomoxetine and circulates in plasma at lower concentrations ( 5 % of atomoxetine concentration in EMs and 45 % of atomoxetine concentration in PMs ) .
Mean apparent plasma clearance of atomoxetine after oral administration in adult EMs is 0 . 35 L / hr / kg and the mean half – life is 5 . 2 hours .
Following oral administration of atomoxetine to PMs , mean apparent plasma clearance is 0 . 03 L / hr / kg and mean half – life is 21 . 6 hours .
For PMs , AUC of atomoxetine is approximately 10 – fold and Css , max is about 5 – fold greater than EMs .
The elimination half – life of 4 – hydroxyatomoxetine is similar to that of N – desmethylatomoxetine ( 6 to 8 hours ) in EM subjects , while the half – life of N – desmethylatomoxetine is much longer in PM subjects ( 34 to 40 hours ) .
Atomoxetine is excreted primarily as 4 – hydroxyatomoxetine - O - glucuronide , mainly in the urine ( greater than 80 % of the dose ) and to a lesser extent in the feces ( less than 17 % of the dose ) .
Only a small fraction of the STRATTERA dose is excreted as unchanged atomoxetine ( less than 3 % of the dose ) , indicating extensive biotransformation .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis — Atomoxetine HCl was not carcinogenic in rats and mice when given in the diet for 2 years at time – weighted average doses up to 47 and 458 mg / kg / day , respectively .
The highest dose used in rats is approximately 8 and 5 times the maximum human dose in children and adults , respectively , on a mg / m2 basis .
Plasma levels ( AUC ) of atomoxetine at this dose in rats are estimated to be 1 . 8 times ( extensive metabolizers ) or 0 . 2 times ( poor metabolizers ) those in humans receiving the maximum human dose .
The highest dose used in mice is approximately 39 and 26 times the maximum human dose in children and adults , respectively , on a mg / m2 basis .
Mutagenesis — Atomoxetine HCl was negative in a battery of genotoxicity studies that included a reverse point mutation assay ( Ames Test ) , an in vitro mouse lymphoma assay , a chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster ovary cells , an unscheduled DNA synthesis test in rat hepatocytes , and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice .
However , there was a slight increase in the percentage of Chinese hamster ovary cells with diplochromosomes , suggesting endoreduplication ( numerical aberration ) .
The metabolite N – desmethylatomoxetine HCl was negative in the Ames Test , mouse lymphoma assay , and unscheduled DNA synthesis test .
Impairment of fertility — Atomoxetine HCl did not impair fertility in rats when given in the diet at doses of up to 57 mg / kg / day , which is approximately 6 times the maximum human dose on a mg / m2 basis .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 ADHD studies in Children and Adolescents Acute Studies — The effectiveness of STRATTERA in the treatment of ADHD was established in 4 randomized , double – blind , placebo – controlled studies of pediatric patients ( ages 6 to 18 ) .
Approximately one – third of the patients met DSM – IV criteria for inattentive subtype and two – thirds met criteria for both inattentive and hyperactive / impulsive subtypes .
Signs and symptoms of ADHD were evaluated by a comparison of mean change from baseline to endpoint for STRATTERA - and placebo – treated patients using an intent – to – treat analysis of the primary outcome measure , the investigator administered and scored ADHD Rating Scale – IV – Parent Version ( ADHDRS ) total score including hyperactive / impulsive and inattentive subscales .
Each item on the ADHDRS maps directly to one symptom criterion for ADHD in the DSM – IV .
In Study 1 , an 8 – week randomized , double – blind , placebo – controlled , dose – response , acute treatment study of children and adolescents aged 8 to 18 ( N = 297 ) , patients received either a fixed dose of STRATTERA ( 0 . 5 , 1 . 2 , or 1 . 8 mg / kg / day ) or placebo .
STRATTERA was administered as a divided dose in the early morning and late afternoon / early evening .
At the 2 higher doses , improvements in ADHD symptoms were statistically significantly superior in STRATTERA – treated patients compared with placebo – treated patients as measured on the ADHDRS scale .
The 1 . 8 mg / kg / day STRATTERA dose did not provide any additional benefit over that observed with the 1 . 2 mg / kg / day dose .
The 0 . 5 mg / kg / day STRATTERA dose was not superior to placebo .
In Study 2 , a 6 – week randomized , double – blind , placebo – controlled , acute treatment study of children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 ( N = 171 ) , patients received either STRATTERA or placebo .
STRATTERA was administered as a single dose in the early morning and titrated on a weight – adjusted basis according to clinical response , up to a maximum dose of 1 . 5 mg / kg / day .
The mean final dose of STRATTERA was approximately 1 . 3 mg / kg / day .
ADHD symptoms were statistically significantly improved on STRATTERA compared with placebo , as measured on the ADHDRS scale .
This study shows that STRATTERA is effective when administered once daily in the morning .
In 2 identical , 9 – week , acute , randomized , double – blind , placebo – controlled studies of children aged 7 to 13 ( Study 3 , N = 147 ; Study 4 , N = 144 ) , STRATTERA and methylphenidate were compared with placebo .
STRATTERA was administered as a divided dose in the early morning and late afternoon ( after school ) and titrated on a weight – adjusted basis according to clinical response .
The maximum recommended STRATTERA dose was 2 . 0 mg / kg / day .
The mean final dose of STRATTERA for both studies was approximately 1 . 6 mg / kg / day .
In both studies , ADHD symptoms statistically significantly improved more on STRATTERA than on placebo , as measured on the ADHDRS scale .
Examination of population subsets based on gender and age ( < 12 and 12 to 17 ) did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings .
There was not sufficient exposure of ethnic groups other than Caucasian to allow exploration of differences in these subgroups .
Maintenance Study — The effectiveness of STRATTERA in the maintenance treatment of ADHD was established in an outpatient study of children and adolescents ( ages 6 - 15 years ) .
Patients meeting DSM - IV criteria for ADHD who showed continuous response for about 4 weeks during an initial 10 week open - label treatment phase with STRATTERA ( 1 . 2 to 1 . 8 mg / kg / day ) were randomized to continuation of their current dose of STRATTERA ( N = 292 ) or to placebo ( N = 124 ) under double - blind treatment for observation of relapse .
Response during the open - label phase was defined as CGI - ADHD - S score ≤ 2 and a reduction of at least 25 % from baseline in ADHDRS - IV - Parent : Inv total score .
Patients who were assigned to STRATTERA and showed continuous response for approximately 8 months during the first double - blind treatment phase were again randomized to continuation of their current dose of STRATTERA ( N = 81 ) or to placebo ( N = 82 ) under double - blind treatment for observation of relapse .
Relapse during the double - blind phase was defined as CGI - ADHD - S score increases of at least 2 from the end of open - label phase and ADHDRS - IV - Parent : Inv total score returns to ≥ 90 % of study entry score for 2 consecutive visits .
In both double - blind phases , patients receiving continued STRATTERA treatment experienced significantly longer times to relapse than those receiving placebo .
14 . 2 ADHD studies in Adults The effectiveness of STRATTERA in the treatment of ADHD was established in 2 randomized , double – blind , placebo – controlled clinical studies of adult patients , age 18 and older , who met DSM – IV criteria for ADHD .
Signs and symptoms of ADHD were evaluated using the investigator – administered Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale Screening Version ( CAARS ) , a 30 – item scale .
The primary effectiveness measure was the 18 – item Total ADHD Symptom score ( the sum of the inattentive and hyperactivity / impulsivity subscales from the CAARS ) evaluated by a comparison of mean change from baseline to endpoint using an intent – to – treat analysis .
In 2 identical , 10 – week , randomized , double – blind , placebo – controlled acute treatment studies ( Study 5 , N = 280 ; Study 6 , N = 256 ) , patients received either STRATTERA or placebo .
STRATTERA was administered as a divided dose in the early morning and late afternoon / early evening and titrated according to clinical response in a range of 60 to 120 mg / day .
The mean final dose of STRATTERA for both studies was approximately 95 mg / day .
In both studies , ADHD symptoms were statistically significantly improved on STRATTERA , as measured on the ADHD Symptom score from the CAARS scale .
Examination of population subsets based on gender and age ( < 42 and ≥ 42 ) did not reveal any differential responsiveness on the basis of these subgroupings .
There was not sufficient exposure of ethnic groups other than Caucasian to allow exploration of differences in these subgroups .
