Progesterone capsules contain micronized progesterone for oral administration .
Progesterone has a molecular weight of 314 . 47 and a molecular formula of C21H30O2 .
Progesterone ( pregn - 4 - ene - 3 , 20 - dione ) is a white or creamy white , odorless , crystalline powder practically insoluble in water , soluble in alcohol , acetone and dioxane and sparingly soluble in vegetable oils , stable in air , melting between 126 ° and 131 ° C .
The structural formula is : [ Chemical Structure ] Progesterone is synthesized from a starting material from a plant source and is chemically identical to progesterone of human ovarian origin .
Progesterone capsules are available in multiple strengths to afford dosage flexibility for optimum management .
Progesterone capsules contain 100 mg or 200 mg micronized progesterone and the following inactive ingredients : peanut oil , gelatin , glycerin , soya lecithin , titanium dioxide , and triglyderides medium chain .
Progesterone capsules are an oral dosage form of micronized progesterone which is chemically identical to progesterone of ovarian origin .
The oral bioavailability of progesterone is increased through micronization .
Pharmacokinetics A . Absorption After oral administration of progesterone as a micronized soft - gelatin capsule formulation , maximum serum concentrations were attained within 3 hours .
The absolute bioavailability of micronized progesterone is not known .
Table 1 summarizes the mean pharmacokinetic parameters in postmenopausal women after five oral daily doses of progesterone capsules 100 mg as a micronized soft - gelatin capsule formulation .

Although doses greater than 300 mg per day were not studied in females , serum concentrations from a study in male volunteers appeared linear and dose proportional between 100 mg per day and 400 mg per day .
The pharmacokinetic parameters in male volunteers were generally consistent with those seen in postmenopausal women .
B . Distribution Progesterone is approximately 96 percent to 99 percent bound to serum proteins , primarily to serum albumin ( 50 to 54 percent ) and transcortin ( 43 to 48 percent ) .
C . Metabolism Progesterone is metabolized primarily by the liver largely to pregnanediols and pregnanolones .
Pregnanediols and pregnanolones are conjugated in the liver to glucuronide and sulfate metabolites .
Progesterone metabolites which are excreted in the bile may be deconjugated and may be further metabolized in the intestine via reduction , dehydroxylation , and epimerization .
D . Excretion The glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of pregnanediol and pregnanolone are excreted in the bile and urine .
Progesterone metabolites are eliminated mainly by the kidneys .
Progesterone metabolites which are excreted in the bile may undergo enterohepatic recycling or may be excreted in the feces .
E . Special Populations The pharmacokinetics of progesterone capsules have not been assessed in low body weight or obese patients .
Hepatic Insufficiency : The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of progesterone capsules has not been studied .
Renal Insufficiency : The effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of progesterone capsules has not been studied .
F . Food – Drug Interaction Concomitant food ingestion increased the bioavailability of progesterone capsules relative to a fasting state when administered to postmenopausal women at a dose of 200 mg .
G . Drug Interactions The metabolism of progesterone by human liver microsomes was inhibited by ketoconazole ( IC50 < 0 . 1 μM ) .
Ketoconazole is a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4 , hence these data suggest that ketoconazole or other known inhibitors of this enzyme may increase the bioavailability of progesterone .
The clinical relevance of the in vitro findings is unknown .
Coadministration of conjugated estrogens and progesterone capsules to 29 postmenopausal women over a 12 - day period resulted in an increase in total estrone concentrations ( Cmax 3 . 68 ng / mL to 4 . 93 ng / mL ) and total equilin concentrations ( Cmax 2 . 27 ng / mL to 3 . 22 ng / mL ) and a decrease in circulating 17β estradiol concentrations ( Cmax 0 . 037 ng / mL to 0 . 030 ng / mL ) .
The half - life of the conjugated estrogens was similar with coadministration of progesterone capsules .
Table 2 summarizes the pharmacokinetic parameters .

The treatment groups were : Progesterone capsules at the dose of 200 mg per day for 12 days per 28 - day cycle in combination with conjugated estrogens 0 . 625 mg per day ( n = 120 ) ; conjugated estrogens 0 . 625 mg per day only ( n = 119 ) ; or placebo ( n = 119 ) .
The subjects in all three treatment groups were primarily Caucasian women ( 87 percent or more of each group ) .
The results for the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia in women receiving up to 3 years of treatment are shown in Table 3 .
A comparison of the progesterone capsules plus conjugated estrogens treatment group to the conjugated estrogens only group showed a significantly lower rate of hyperplasia ( 6 percent combination product versus 64 percent estrogen alone ) in the progesterone capsules plus conjugated estrogens treatment group throughout 36 months of treatment .

This figure illustrates graphically that the proportion of patients with hyperplasia was significantly greater for the conjugated estrogens group ( 64 percent ) compared to the conjugated estrogens plus progesterone capsules group ( 6 percent ) .
[ Figure 1 ] Figure 1 .
Time to Hyperplasia in Women Receiving up to 36 Months of Treatment The discontinuation rates due to hyperplasia over the 36 months of treatment are as shown in Table 4 .
For any degree of hyperplasia , the discontinuation rate for patients who received conjugated estrogens plus progesterone capsules was similar to that of the placebo only group , while the discontinuation rate for patients who received conjugated estrogens alone was significantly higher .
Women who permanently discontinued treatment due to hyperplasia were similar in demographics to the overall study population .

In a multicenter , parallel - group , open label , postmarketing dosing study that included premenopausal women with secondary amenorrhea for at least 90 days , administration of 10 days of progesterone capsules during two 28 - day treatment cycles , 300 mg per day ( n = 107 ) or 400 mg per day ( n = 99 ) , resulted in 73 . 8 percent and 76 . 8 percent of women , respectively , experiencing withdrawal bleeding .
The rate of secretory transformation was evaluated in a multicenter , randomized , double - blind clinical study in estrogen - primed postmenopausal women .
Progesterone capsules administered orally for 10 days at 400 mg per day ( n = 22 ) induced complete secretory changes in the endometrium in 45 percent of women compared to 0 percent in the placebo group ( n = 23 ) .
A second multicenter , parallel - group , open label postmarketing dosing study in premenopausal women with secondary amenorrhea for at least 90 days also evaluated the rate of secretory transformation .
All subjects received daily oral conjugated estrogens over 3 consecutive 28 - day treatment cycles and progesterone capsules , 300 mg per day ( n = 107 ) or 400 mg per day ( n = 99 ) for 10 days of each treatment cycle .
The rate of complete secretory transformation was 21 . 5 percent and 28 . 3 percent , respectively .
Women ' s Health Initiative Studies The Women ' s Health Initiative ( WHI ) enrolled approximately 27 , 000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two substudies to assess the risks and benefits of daily oral conjugated estrogens ( CE ) [ 0 . 625 mg ] - alone or in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA ) [ 2 . 5 mg ] compared to placebo in the prevention of certain chronic diseases .
The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease [ ( CHD ) defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction ( MI ) , silent MI and CHD death ] , with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome .
A " global index " included the earliest occurrence of CHD , invasive breast cancer , stroke , pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , endometrial cancer ( only in the CE plus MPA substudy ) , colorectal cancer , hip fracture , or death due to other cause .
These sub studies did not evaluate the effects of CE – alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms .
WHI Estrogen Plus Progestin Substudy The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early .
According to the predefined stopping rule , after an average follow - up of 5 . 6 years of treatment , the increased risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the " global index . "
The absolute excess risk of events in the " global index " was 19 per 10 , 000 women - years .
For those outcomes included in the WHI " global index " that reached statistical significance after 5 . 6 years of follow - up , the absolute excess risks per 10 , 000 women - years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events , 8 more strokes , 10 more PEs , and 8 more invasive breast cancers , while the absolute risk reductions per 10 , 000 women - years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures .
Results of the estrogen plus progestin substudy , which included 16 , 608 women ( average 63 years of age , range 50 to 79 ; 83 . 9 percent White , 6 . 8 percent Black , 5 . 4 percent Hispanic , 3 . 9 percent Other ) are presented in Table 5 .
These results reflect centrally adjudicated data after an average follow - up of 5 . 6 years .

The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy stratified for age showed in women 50 to 59 years of age a non - significant trend toward reducing risk of overall mortality [ hazard ratio ( HR ) 0 . 69 ( 95 percent CI , 0 . 44 - 1 . 07 ) ] .
Women ' s Health Initiative Memory Study The estrogen plus progestin Women ' s Health Initiative Memory Study ( WHIMS ) , an ancillary study of WHI , enrolled 4 , 532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older ( 47 percent were 65 to 69 years of age ; 35 percent were 70 to 74 years of age ; and 18 percent were 75 years of age and older ) to evaluate the effects of daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) on the incidence of probable dementia ( primary outcome ) compared to placebo .
After an average follow - up of 4 years , the relative risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 2 . 05 ( 95 percent CI , 1 . 21 – 3 . 48 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 per 10 , 000 women - years .
Probable dementia as defined in this study included Alzheimer ' s disease ( AD ) , vascular dementia ( VaD ) and mixed type ( having features of both AD and VaD ) .
The most common classification of probable dementia in the treatment group and the placebo group was AD .
Since the ancillary study was conducted in women 65 to 79 years of age , it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women .

Cardiovascular disorders An increased risk of pulmonary embolism , deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , stroke , and myocardial infarction has been reported with estrogen plus progestin therapy .
Should any of these occur or be suspected , estrogen with progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately .
Risk factors for arterial vascular disease ( for example , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , tobacco use , hypercholesterolemia , and obesity ) and / or venous thromboembolism ( for example , personal history or family history of venous thromboembolism [ VTE ] , obesity , and systemic lupus erythematosus ) should be managed appropriately .
a . Stroke In the Women ' s Health Initiative ( WHI ) estrogen plus progestin substudy , a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo ( 33 versus 25 per 10 , 000 women - years ) .
The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted .
( See CLINICAL STUDIES . )
Should a stroke occur or be suspected , estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately .
b . Coronary Heart Disease In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy , there was a statistically non - significant increased risk of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) events ( defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction [ MI ] , silent MI , or CHD death ) reported in women receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) compared to women receiving placebo ( 41 versus 34 per 10 , 000 women - years ) .
An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year 1 and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5 .
( See CLINICAL STUDIES . )
In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease ( n = 2 , 763 , average age 66 . 7 years ) , in a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease ( Heart and Estrogen / Progestin Replacement Study [ HERS ] ) , treatment with daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit .
During an average follow - up of 4 . 1 years , treatment with CE plus MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease .
There were more CHD events in the CE plus MPA - treated group than in the placebo group in year 1 , but not during the subsequent years .
Two thousand , three hundred and twenty - one ( 2 , 321 ) women from the original HERS trial agreed to participate in an open - label extension of HERS , HERS II .
Average follow - up in HERS II was an additional 2 . 7 years , for a total of 6 . 8 years overall .
Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE plus MPA group and the placebo group in HERS , HERS II , and overall .
c . Venous Thromboembolism In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy , a statistically significant 2 - fold greater rate of VTE ( DVT and pulmonary embolism [ PE ] ) was reported in women receiving daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) compared to women receiving placebo ( 35 versus 17 per 10 , 000 women - years ) .
Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT ( 26 versus 13 per 10 , 000 women - years ) and PE ( 18 versus 8 per 10 , 000 women - years ) were also demonstrated .
The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted .
( See CLINICAL STUDIES . )
Should a VTE occur or be suspected , estrogen plus progestin therapy should be discontinued immediately .
If feasible , estrogens with progestins should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism , or during periods of prolonged immobilization .
2 .
Malignant neoplasms a . Breast Cancer The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin users is the Women ' s Health Initiative ( WHI ) substudy of daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) .
After a mean follow - up of 5 . 6 years , the estrogen plus progestin substudy reported an increased risk of invasive breast cancer in women who took daily CE plus MPA .
In this substudy , prior use of estrogen - alone or estrogen plus progestin therapy was reported by 26 percent of the women .
The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1 . 24 ( 95 percent nCI , 1 . 01 - 1 . 54 ) , and the absolute risk was 41 versus 33 cases per 10 , 000 women - years , for CE plus MPA compared with placebo .
Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy , the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1 . 86 , and the absolute risk was 46 versus 25 cases per 10 , 000 women - years , for estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo .
Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy , the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1 . 09 , and the absolute risk was 40 versus 36 cases per 10 , 000 women - years for CE plus MPA compared with placebo .
In the same substudy , invasive breast cancers were larger , were more likely to be node positive , and were diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) group compared with the placebo group .
Metastatic disease was rare , with no apparent difference between the two groups .
Other prognostic factors such as histologic subtype , grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups .
( See CLINICAL STUDIES . )
Consistent with the WHI clinical trials , observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen plus progestin therapy , and a smaller increased risk for estrogen - alone therapy , after several years of use .
The risk increased with duration of use , and appeared to return to baseline over about 5 years after stopping treatment ( only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping ) .
Observational studies also suggest that the risk of breast cancer was greater , and became apparent earlier , with estrogen plus progestin therapy as compared to estrogen - alone therapy .
However , these studies have not generally found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogen plus progestin combinations , doses , or routes of administration .
The use of estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation .
All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a healthcare provider and perform monthly breast self - examinations .
In addition , mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age , risk factors , and prior mammogram results .
b . Endometrial Cancer An increased risk of endometrial cancer has been reported with the use of unopposed estrogen therapy in a woman with a uterus .
The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 to 12 times greater than in non - users , and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose .
Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with the use of estrogens for less than 1 year .
The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use , with increased risks of 15 - to 24 - fold for 5 to 10 years or more and this risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued .
Clinical surveillance of all women using estrogen plus progestin therapy is important .
Adequate diagnostic measures , including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated , should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding .
There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose .
Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia , which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer .
c . Ovarian Cancer The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported a statistically non - significant increased risk of ovarian cancer .
After an average follow - up of 5 . 6 years , the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 1 . 58 ( 95 percent nCI , 0 . 77 – 3 . 24 ) .
The absolute risk for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 4 versus 3 cases per 10 , 000 women - years .
In some epidemiologic studies , the use of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen - only products , in particular for 5 or more years , has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer .
However , the duration of exposure associated with increased risk is not consistent across all epidemiologic studies and some report no association .
3 .
Probable dementia In the estrogen plus progestin Women ' s Health Initiative Memory Study ( WHIMS ) , an ancillary study of WHI , a population of 4 , 532 postmenopausal women 65 to 79 years of age was randomized to daily CE ( 0 . 625 mg ) plus MPA ( 2 . 5 mg ) or placebo .
In the WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study , after an average follow - up of 4 years , 40 women in the CE plus MPA group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia .
The relative risk of probable dementia for estrogen plus progestin versus placebo was 2 . 05 ( 95 percent CI , 1 . 21 - 3 . 48 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE plus MPA versus placebo was 45 versus 22 cases per 10 , 000 women - years .
It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women .
