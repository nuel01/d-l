( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS TREMFYA is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious hypersensitivity reaction to guselkumab or to any of the excipients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Serious hypersensitivity reactions to guselkumab or to any of the excipients .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypersensitivity Reactions : Serious hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis , may occur .
( 5 . 1 ) • Infections : TREMFYA may increase the risk of infection .
Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur .
If a serious infection develops , discontinue TREMFYA until the infection resolves .
( 5 . 2 ) • Tuberculosis ( TB ) : Evaluate for TB prior to initiating treatment with TREMFYA .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylaxis , have been reported with postmarket use of TREMFYA .
Some cases required hospitalization .
If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs , discontinue TREMFYA and initiate appropriate therapy .
5 . 2 Infections TREMFYA may increase the risk of infection .
In clinical trials in subjects with plaque psoriasis , infections occurred in 23 % of subjects in the TREMFYA group versus 21 % of subjects in the placebo group through 16 weeks of treatment .
Upper respiratory tract infections , gastroenteritis , tinea infections , and herpes simplex infections occurred more frequently in the TREMFYA group than in the placebo group [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The rate of serious infections for the TREMFYA group and the placebo group was ≤ 0 . 2 % .
A similar risk of infection was seen in placebo - controlled trials in subjects with psoriatic arthritis .
Treatment with TREMFYA should not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated .
In patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection , consider the risks and benefits prior to prescribing TREMFYA .
Instruct patients to seek medical help if signs or symptoms of clinically important chronic or acute infection occur .
If a patient develops a clinically important or serious infection or is not responding to standard therapy , monitor the patient closely and discontinue TREMFYA until the infection resolves .
5 . 3 Pre - treatment Evaluation for Tuberculosis Evaluate patients for tuberculosis ( TB ) infection prior to initiating treatment with TREMFYA .
Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering TREMFYA .
In clinical trials , 105 subjects with plaque psoriasis and 71 subjects with psoriatic arthritis with latent TB who were concurrently treated with TREMFYA and appropriate TB prophylaxis did not develop active TB .
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after TREMFYA treatment .
Consider anti - TB therapy prior to initiating TREMFYA in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed .
Do not administer TREMFYA to patients with active TB infection .
5 . 4 Immunizations Prior to initiating therapy with TREMFYA , consider completion of all age appropriate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines .
Avoid use of live vaccines in patients treated with TREMFYA .
No data are available on the response to live or inactive vaccines .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of labeling : • Infections [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] Most common ( ≥ 1 % ) adverse reactions associated with TREMFYA include upper respiratory infections , headache , injection site reactions , arthralgia , bronchitis , diarrhea , gastroenteritis , tinea infections , and herpes simplex infections .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Plaque Psoriasis In clinical trials , a total of 1823 subjects with moderate - to - severe plaque psoriasis received TREMFYA .
Of these , 1393 subjects were exposed to TREMFYA for at least 6 months and 728 subjects were exposed for at least 1 year .
Data from two placebo - and active - controlled trials ( PsO1 and PsO2 ) in 1441 subjects ( mean age 44 years ; 70 % males ; 82 % white ) were pooled to evaluate the safety of TREMFYA ( 100 mg administered subcutaneously at Weeks 0 and 4 , followed by every 8 weeks ) .
Weeks 0 to 16 : In the 16 - week placebo - controlled period of the pooled clinical trials ( PsO1 and PsO2 ) , adverse events occurred in 49 % of subjects in the TREMFYA group compared to 47 % of subjects in the placebo group and 49 % of subjects in the U . S . licensed adalimumab group .
Serious adverse events occurred in 1 . 9 % of subjects in the TREMFYA group ( 6 . 3 events per 100 subject - years of follow - up ) compared to 1 . 4 % of subjects in the placebo group ( 4 . 7 events per 100 subject - years of follow - up ) , and in 2 . 6 % of subjects in U . S . licensed adalimumab group ( 9 . 9 events per 100 subject - years of follow - up ) .
Table 1 summarizes the adverse reactions that occurred at a rate of at least 1 % and at a higher rate in the TREMFYA group than in the placebo group during the 16 - week placebo - controlled period .
Table 1 : Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥ 1 % of Subjects through Week 16 in PsO1 and PsO2 TREMFYA [ 1 ] 100 mg N = 823 n ( % ) Adalimumab [ 2 ] N = 196 n ( % ) Placebo N = 422 n ( % ) Upper respiratory infections [ 3 ] 118 ( 14 . 3 ) 21 ( 10 . 7 ) 54 ( 12 . 8 ) Headache [ 4 ] 38 ( 4 . 6 ) 2 ( 1 . 0 ) 14 ( 3 . 3 ) Injection site reactions [ 5 ] 37 ( 4 . 5 ) 15 ( 7 . 7 ) 12 ( 2 . 8 ) Arthralgia 22 ( 2 . 7 ) 4 ( 2 . 0 ) 9 ( 2 . 1 ) Diarrhea 13 ( 1 . 6 ) 3 ( 1 . 5 ) 4 ( 0 . 9 ) Gastroenteritis [ 6 ] 11 ( 1 . 3 ) 4 ( 2 . 0 ) 4 ( 0 . 9 ) Tinea infections [ 7 ] 9 ( 1 . 1 ) 0 0 Herpes simplex infections [ 8 ] 9 ( 1 . 1 ) 0 2 ( 0 . 5 ) [ 1 ] Subjects receiving 100 mg of TREMFYA at Week 0 , Week 4 , and every 8 weeks thereafter [ 2 ] U . S . licensed adalimumab [ 3 ] Upper respiratory infections include nasopharyngitis , upper respiratory tract infection ( URTI ) , pharyngitis , and viral URTI .
[ 4 ] Headache includes headache and tension headache .
[ 5 ] Injection site reactions include injection site erythema , bruising , hematoma , hemorrhage , swelling , edema , pruritus , pain , discoloration , induration , inflammation , and urticaria .
[ 6 ] Gastroenteritis includes gastroenteritis and viral gastroenteritis .
[ 7 ] Tinea infections include tinea pedis , tinea cruris , tinea infection , and tinea manuum infections .
[ 8 ] Herpes simplex infections include oral herpes , herpes simplex , genital herpes , genital herpes simplex , and nasal herpes simplex .
Adverse reactions that occurred in < 1 % but > 0 . 1 % of subjects in the TREMFYA group and at a higher rate than in the placebo group through Week 16 in PsO1 and PsO2 were migraine , candida infections , and urticaria .
Specific Adverse Reactions Infections Infections occurred in 23 % of subjects in the TREMFYA group compared to 21 % of subjects in the placebo group .
The most common ( ≥ 1 % ) infections were upper respiratory infections , gastroenteritis , tinea infections , and herpes simplex infections ; all cases were mild to moderate in severity and did not lead to discontinuation of TREMFYA .
Elevated Liver Enzymes Elevated liver enzymes were reported more frequently in the TREMFYA group ( 2 . 6 % ) than in the placebo group ( 1 . 9 % ) .
Of the 21 subjects who were reported to have elevated liver enzymes in the TREMFYA group , all events except one were mild to moderate in severity and none of the events led to discontinuation of TREMFYA .
Safety through Week 48 Through Week 48 , no new adverse reactions were identified with TREMFYA use and the frequency of the adverse reactions was similar to the safety profile observed during the first 16 weeks of treatment .
Psoriatic Arthritis TREMFYA was studied in two placebo - controlled trials in subjects with psoriatic arthritis ( 748 subjects on TREMFYA and 372 subjects on placebo ) .
Of the 748 subjects who received TREMFYA , 375 subjects received TREMFYA 100 mg at Week 0 , Week 4 , and every 8 weeks thereafter and 373 subjects received TREMFYA 100 mg every 4 weeks .
The overall safety profile observed in subjects with psoriatic arthritis treated with TREMFYA is generally consistent with the safety profile in subjects with plaque psoriasis with the addition of bronchitis and neutrophil count decreased .
In the 24 - week placebo - controlled period , combined across the two studies , bronchitis occurred in 1 . 6 % of subjects in the TREMFYA q8w group and 2 . 9 % of subjects in the TREMFYA q4w group compared to 1 . 1 % of subjects in the placebo group .
Neutrophil count decreased occurred in 0 . 3 % of subjects in the TREMFYA q8w and 1 . 6 % of subjects in the TREMFYA q4w group compared to 0 % of subjects in the placebo group .
The majority of events of neutrophil count decreased were mild , transient , not associated with infection and did not lead to discontinuation .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is the potential for immunogenicity with TREMFYA .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of incidence of antibodies to guselkumab across indications or with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading .
Plaque Psoriasis Up to Week 52 , approximately 6 % of subjects treated with TREMFYA developed antidrug antibodies .
Of the subjects who developed antidrug antibodies , approximately 7 % had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing antibodies .
Among the 46 subjects who developed antibodies to guselkumab and had evaluable data , 21 subjects exhibited lower trough levels of guselkumab , including one subject who experienced loss of efficacy after developing high antibody titers .
Up to Week 156 , approximately 9 % of subjects treated with TREMFYA developed antidrug antibodies and of these subjects approximately 6 % were classified as neutralizing antibodies .
However , antibodies to guselkumab were generally not associated with changes in clinical response or development of injection - site reactions .
Psoriatic Arthritis Up to Week 24 , 2 % ( n = 15 ) of subjects treated with TREMFYA developed antidrug antibodies .
Of these subjects , 1 had antibodies that were classified as neutralizing antibodies .
Overall , the small number of subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab limits definitive conclusion of the effect of immunogenicity on the pharmacokinetics , efficacy and safety of guselkumab .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post - approval of TREMFYA .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to TREMFYA exposure .
Immune system disorders : Hypersensitivity , including anaphylaxis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Rash [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1CYP450 Substrates The formation of CYP450 enzymes can be altered by increased levels of certain cytokines ( e . g . , IL - 1 , IL - 6 , IL - 10 , TNFα , interferon ) during chronic inflammation .
Results from an exploratory drug - drug interaction study in subjects with moderate - to - severe plaque psoriasis suggested a low potential for clinically relevant drug interactions for drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 but the interaction potential cannot be ruled out for drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 .
However , the results were highly variable because of the limited number of subjects in the study .
Upon initiation of TREMFYA in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates , particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index , consider monitoring for therapeutic effect or drug concentration and consider dosage adjustment as needed [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to TREMFYA during pregnancy .
Patients should be encouraged to enroll by calling 1 - 877 - 311 - 8972 .
Risk Summary There are no available data on TREMFYA use in pregnant women to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes .
Human IgG antibodies are known to cross the placental barrier ; therefore , TREMFYA may be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus .
In a combined embryofetal development and pre - and post - natal development study , no adverse developmental effects were observed in infants born to pregnant monkeys after subcutaneous administration of guselkumab during organogenesis through parturition at doses up to 30 times the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) .
Neonatal deaths were observed at 6 - to 30 - times the MRHD ( see Data ) .
The clinical significance of these nonclinical findings is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In a combined embryofetal development and pre - and post - natal development study , pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered weekly subcutaneous doses of guselkumab up to 50 mg / kg ( 30 times the MRHD based on a mg / kg comparison ) from the beginning of organogenesis to parturition .
Neonatal deaths occurred in the offspring of one control monkey , three monkeys administered guselkumab at 10 mg / kg / week ( 6 times the MRHD based on a mg / kg comparison ) and three monkeys administered guselkumab at 50 mg / kg / week ( 30 times the MRHD based on a mg / kg comparison ) .
The clinical significance of these findings is unknown .
No guselkumab - related effects on functional or immunological development were observed in the infants from birth through 6 months of age .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of guselkumab in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Guselkumab was not detected in the milk of lactating cynomolgus monkeys .
Maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for TREMFYA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from TREMFYA or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of TREMFYA in pediatric patients ( less than 18 years of age ) have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 3406 subjects with plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis exposed to TREMFYA , a total of 185 subjects were 65 years or older , and 13 subjects were 75 years or older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between older and younger subjects who received TREMFYA .
However , the number of subjects aged 65 years and older was not sufficient to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of overdosage , monitor the patient for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and administer appropriate symptomatic treatment immediately .
11 DESCRIPTION Guselkumab , an interleukin - 23 blocker , is a human immunoglobulin G1 lambda ( IgG1λ ) monoclonal antibody .
Guselkumab is produced in a mammalian cell line using recombinant DNA technology .
TREMFYA ( guselkumab ) injection is a sterile , preservative free , clear , colorless to light yellow solution that may contain small translucent particles .
TREMFYA is supplied as a single - dose solution in a 1 mL glass syringe with a 27 G , half inch fixed needle assembled in a passive needle guard delivery system or One - Press patient - controlled injector for subcutaneous use .
Each TREMFYA 1 mL prefilled syringe or One - Press patient - controlled injector contains 100 mg guselkumab , L - histidine ( 0 . 6 mg ) , L - histidine monohydrochloride monohydrate ( 1 . 5 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 0 . 5 mg ) , sucrose ( 79 mg ) and water for injection at pH 5 . 8 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Guselkumab is a human monoclonal IgG1λ antibody that selectively binds to the p19 subunit of interleukin 23 ( IL - 23 ) and inhibits its interaction with the IL - 23 receptor .
IL - 23 is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses .
Guselkumab inhibits the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In evaluated subjects with plaque psoriasis , guselkumab reduced serum levels of IL - 17 A , IL - 17 F and IL - 22 relative to pre - treatment levels based on exploratory analyses of the pharmacodynamic markers .
In evaluated subjects with psoriatic arthritis , serum levels of acute phase proteins C - reactive protein , serum amyloid A and IL - 6 , and Th17 effector cytokines IL - 17 A , IL - 17 F and IL - 22 were elevated at baseline .
Serum levels of these proteins measured at Week 4 and Week 24 were decreased compared to baseline following guselkumab treatment at Week 0 , Week 4 and every 8 weeks thereafter .
The relationship between these pharmacodynamic markers and the mechanism ( s ) by which guselkumab exerts its clinical effects is unknown .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Guselkumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics in healthy subjects and subjects with plaque psoriasis following subcutaneous injections .
In subjects with plaque psoriasis , following subcutaneous administration of 100 mg of TREMFYA at Weeks 0 and 4 , and every 8 weeks thereafter , mean steady - state trough serum guselkumab concentration was approximately 1 . 2 mcg / mL .
The pharmacokinetics of guselkumab in subjects with psoriatic arthritis was similar to that in subjects with plaque psoriasis .
Following subcutaneous administration of 100 mg of TREMFYA at Weeks 0 , 4 , and every 8 weeks thereafter , mean steady - state trough serum guselkumab concentration was approximately 1 . 2 mcg / mL .
Absorption Following a single 100 mg subcutaneous injection in healthy subjects , guselkumab reached a mean ( ± SD ) maximum serum concentration of 8 . 09 ± 3 . 68 mcg / mL by approximately 5 . 5 days post dose .
The absolute bioavailability of guselkumab following a single 100 mg subcutaneous injection was estimated to be approximately 49 % in healthy subjects .
Distribution In subjects with plaque psoriasis , apparent volume of distribution was 13 . 5 L . Elimination Apparent clearance in subjects with plaque psoriasis was 0 . 516 L / day .
Mean half - life of guselkumab was approximately 15 to 18 days in subjects with plaque psoriasis across trials .
Metabolism The exact pathway through which guselkumab is metabolized has not been characterized .
As a human IgG monoclonal antibody , guselkumab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG .
Specific Populations No apparent differences in clearance were observed in subjects ≥ 65 years of age compared to subjects < 65 years of age , suggesting no dose adjustment is needed for elderly subjects .
Clearance and volume of distribution of guselkumab increases as body weight increases , however , observed clinical trial data indicate that dose adjustment for body weight is not warranted .
No specific trials have been conducted to determine the effect of renal or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of guselkumab .
Drug Interactions Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that concomitant use of NSAIDs , oral corticosteroids and conventional DMARDs such as methotrexate , did not affect the clearance of guselkumab .
Cytochrome P450 Substrates The effects of guselkumab on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam ( metabolized by CYP3A4 ) , warfarin ( metabolized by CYP2C9 ) , omeprazole ( metabolized by CYP2C19 ) , dextromethorphan ( metabolized by CYP2D6 ) , and caffeine ( metabolized by CYP1A2 ) were evaluated in an exploratory study with 6 to 12 evaluable subjects with moderate - to - severe plaque psoriasis .
Changes in AUCinf of midazolam , S - warfarin , omeprazole , and caffeine after a single dose of guselkumab were not clinically relevant .
For dextromethorphan , changes in AUCinf after guselkumab were not clinically relevant in 9 out of 10 subjects ; however , a 2 . 9 - fold change in AUCinf was observed in one individual [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of TREMFYA .
No effects on fertility parameters were observed after male guinea pigs were subcutaneously administered guselkumab at a dose of 25 mg / kg twice weekly ( 15 times the MRHD based on a mg / kg comparison ) .
No effects on fertility parameters were observed after female guinea pigs were subcutaneously administered guselkumab at doses up to 100 mg / kg twice weekly ( 60 times the MRHD based on a mg / kg comparison ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Plaque Psoriasis Four multicenter , randomized , double - blind trials ( PsO1 [ NCT02207231 ] , PsO2 [ NCT02207244 ] , PsO3 [ NCT02203032 ] , and PsO4 [ NCT02905331 ] ) enrolled subjects 18 years of age and older with moderate - to - severe plaque psoriasis who were eligible for systemic therapy or phototherapy .
Subjects had an Investigator ' s Global Assessment ( IGA ) score of ≥ 3 ( " moderate " ) on a 5 - point scale of overall disease severity , a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index ( PASI ) score ≥ 12 , and a minimum affected body surface area ( BSA ) of 10 % .
Subjects with guttate , erythrodermic , or pustular psoriasis were excluded .
Trials PsO1 and PsO2 In PsO1 and PsO2 , 1443 subjects were randomized to either TREMFYA ( 100 mg at Weeks 0 and 4 and every 8 weeks thereafter ) administered with a prefilled syringe , placebo or U . S . licensed adalimumab ( 80 mg at Week 0 and 40 mg at Week 1 , followed by 40 mg every other week thereafter ) .
Both trials assessed the responses at Week 16 compared to placebo for the two co - primary endpoints : • the proportion of subjects who achieved an IGA score of 0 ( " cleared " ) or 1 ( " minimal " ) ; • the proportion of subjects who achieved at least a 90 % reduction from baseline in the PASI composite score ( PASI 90 ) .
Comparisons between TREMFYA and U . S . licensed adalimumab were secondary endpoints at the following time points : • at Week 16 ( PsO1 and PsO2 ) , the proportions of subjects who achieved an IGA score of 0 or 1 , a PASI 90 , and a PASI 75 response ; • at Week 24 ( PsO1 and PsO2 ) , and at Week 48 ( PsO1 ) , the proportions of subjects achieving an IGA score of 0 , an IGA score of 0 or 1 , and a PASI 90 response .
Other evaluated outcomes included improvement in psoriasis symptoms assessed on the Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary ( PSSD ) and improvements in psoriasis of the scalp at Week 16 .
In both trials , subjects were predominantly men and white , with a mean age of 44 years and a mean weight of 90 kg .
At baseline , subjects had a median affected BSA of approximately 21 % , a median PASI score of 19 , and 18 % had a history of psoriatic arthritis .
Approximately 24 % of subjects had an IGA score of severe .
In both trials , 23 % had received prior biologic systemic therapy .

Examination of age , gender , race , body weight , and previous treatment with systemic or biologic agents did not identify differences in response to TREMFYA among these subgroups .
Maintenance and Durability of Response To evaluate maintenance and durability of response ( PsO2 ) , subjects randomized to TREMFYA at Week 0 and who were PASI 90 responders at Week 28 were re - randomized to either continue treatment with TREMFYA every 8 weeks or be withdrawn from therapy ( i . e . receive placebo ) .
At Week 48 , 89 % of subjects who continued on TREMFYA maintained PASI 90 compared to 37 % of subjects who were re - randomized to placebo and withdrawn from TREMFYA .
For responders at Week 28 who were re - randomized to placebo and withdrawn from TREMFYA , the median time to loss of PASI 90 was approximately 15 weeks .
Patient Reported Outcomes Greater improvements in symptoms of psoriasis ( itch , pain , stinging , burning and skin tightness ) at Week 16 in TREMFYA compared to placebo were observed in both trials based on the Psoriasis Symptoms and Signs Diary ( PSSD ) .
Greater proportions of subjects on TREMFYA compared to U . S . licensed adalimumab achieved a PSSD symptom score of 0 ( symptom - free ) at Week 24 in both trials .
Trial PsO3 PsO3 [ NCT02203032 ] evaluated the efficacy of 24 weeks of treatment with TREMFYA in subjects ( N = 268 ) who had not achieved an adequate response , defined as IGA ≥ 2 at Week 16 after initial treatment with U . S . licensed ustekinumab ( dosed 45 mg or 90 mg according to the subject ' s baseline weight at Week 0 and Week 4 ) .
These subjects were randomized to either continue with U . S . licensed ustekinumab treatment every 12 weeks or switch to TREMFYA 100 mg at Weeks 16 , 20 , and every 8 weeks thereafter .
Baseline characteristics for randomized subjects were similar to those observed in PsO1 and PsO2 .
In subjects with an inadequate response ( IGA ≥ 2 at Week 16 to U . S . licensed ustekinumab ) , greater proportions of subjects on TREMFYA compared to U . S . licensed ustekinumab achieved an IGA score of 0 or 1 with a ≥ 2 grade improvement at Week 28 ( 31 % vs . 14 % , respectively ; 12 weeks after randomization ) .
Trial PsO4 PsO4 [ NCT02905331 ] evaluated the efficacy , safety , and pharmacokinetics of TREMFYA administered with the One - Press injector .
In this study , 78 subjects were randomized to receive either TREMFYA ( 100 mg at Weeks 0 and 4 and every 8 weeks thereafter ) [ N = 62 ] , or placebo [ N = 16 ] .
Baseline characteristics for subjects were comparable to those observed in PsO1 and PsO2 .
The co - primary endpoints were the same as those for PsO1 and PsO2 .
Secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects who achieved an IGA score of 0 at Week 16 and the proportion of subjects who achieved a PASI 100 response at Week 16 .
A greater proportion of subjects in the guselkumab group achieved an IGA score of 0 or 1 or a PASI 90 response at Week 16 ( 81 % and 76 % , respectively ) than in the placebo group ( 0 % for both endpoints ) .
The proportion of subjects who achieved an IGA score of 0 at Week 16 was higher in the guselkumab group compared to the placebo group ( 56 % vs . 0 % ) .
The proportion of subjects who achieved a PASI 100 response at Week 16 was higher in the guselkumab group compared to the placebo group ( 50 % vs . 0 % ) .
14 . 2 Psoriatic Arthritis The safety and efficacy of TREMFYA were assessed in 1120 subjects in 2 randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trials ( PsA1 [ NCT03162796 ] and PsA2 [ NCT03158285 ] ) in adult subjects with active psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) ( ≥ 3 swollen joints , ≥ 3 tender joints , and a C - reactive protein ( CRP ) level of ≥ 0 . 3 mg / dL in PsA1 and ≥ 5 swollen joints , ≥ 5 tender joints , and a CRP level of ≥ 0 . 6 mg / dL in PsA2 ) who had inadequate response to standard therapies ( e . g . conventional DMARDs [ cDMARDs ] ) , apremilast , or nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs [ NSAIDs ] ) .
Patients in these trials had a diagnosis of PsA for at least 6 months based on the Classification criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis ( CASPAR ) and a median duration of PsA of 4 years at baseline .
In PsA1 approximately 31 % of subjects had been previously treated with up to 2 anti - tumor necrosis factor alpha ( anti - TNFα ) agents whereas in PsA2 all subjects were biologic naïve .
Approximately 58 % of subjects from both trials had concomitant methotrexate ( MTX ) use .
Patients with different subtypes of PsA were enrolled in both trials , including polyarticular arthritis with the absence of rheumatoid nodules ( 40 % ) , spondylitis with peripheral arthritis ( 30 % ) , asymmetric peripheral arthritis ( 23 % ) , distal interphalangeal involvement ( 7 % ) and arthritis mutilans ( 1 % ) .
At baseline , over 65 % and 42 % of the subjects had enthesitis and dactylitis , respectively and 79 % had ≥ 3 % body surface area ( BSA ) psoriasis skin involvement .
PsA1 evaluated 381 subjects who were treated with placebo SC , TREMFYA 100 mg SC at Weeks 0 , 4 and every 8 weeks ( q8w ) thereafter , or TREMFYA 100 mg SC every 4 weeks ( q4w ) .
PsA2 evaluated 739 subjects who were treated with placebo SC , TREMFYA 100 mg SC at Weeks 0 , 4 and q8w thereafter , or TREMFYA 100 mg SC q4w .
The primary endpoint in both trials was the percentage of subjects achieving an ACR20 response at Week 24 .
Clinical Response In both trials , subjects treated with TREMFYA 100 mg q8w demonstrated a greater clinical response including ACR20 , compared to placebo at Week 24 ( Tables 4 and 5 ) .
Similar responses were seen regardless of prior anti - TNFα exposure in PsA1 , and in both trials similar responses were seen regardless of concomitant cDMARD use , previous treatment with cDMARDs , gender and body weight .
