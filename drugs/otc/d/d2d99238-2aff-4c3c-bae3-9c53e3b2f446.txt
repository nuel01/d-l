6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety profile of XEPI was assessed in two clinical trials ( Trial 1 and Trial 2 ) in 362 adult and pediatric patients two months of age and older with impetigo .
The patients used at least one dose from a 5 - day , twice a day regimen of XEPI .
Control groups included 361 patients who used placebo and 152 patients who used retapamulin ointment .
The median age of the patients enrolled in the clinical trials was 10 years ; 3 % of patients were 2 months to less than 2 years of age , 55 % of patients were 2 to less than 12 years of age , 11 % of patients were 12 to less than 18 years of age , and 31 % of patients were 18 years of age or older .
Adverse reactions ( rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis ) were reported in 1 adult patient treated with XEPI .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on the use of XEPI in pregnant women to inform a drug associated risk .
Systemic absorption of XEPI in humans is negligible following topical administration of XEPI ( up to twice the concentration of the marketed formulation ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Due to the negligible systemic exposure , it is not expected that maternal use of XEPI will result in fetal exposure to the drug .
Animal reproduction studies were not conducted with XEPI .
However , toxicity studies conducted in pregnant rats and rabbits administered the oral form of ozenoxacin showed no significant adverse developmental effects ( at > 10 , 000 times the maximum human plasma concentration seen with dermal application of ozenoxacin ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of ozenoxacin in human milk , and the effects of ozenoxacin on the breastfed infant or on milk production .
However , breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to ozenoxacin due to the negligible systemic absorption of ozenoxacin in humans following topical administration of XEPI .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for XEPI and any potential adverse effects on the breast - fed child from XEPI or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of XEPI in the treatment of impetigo have been established in pediatric patients 2 months to 17 years of age .
Use of XEPI in pediatric patients ( 2 months to 17 years of age ) is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies of XEPI in which 251 pediatric patients received at least one dose of XEPI .
The median age of the patients enrolled in the clinical trials was 10 years ; 3 % of patients were 2 months to less than 2 years of age , 55 % of patients were 2 to less than 12 years of age , 11 % of patients were 12 to less than 18 years of age , and 31 % of patients were 18 years of age or older .
In these studies , the maximum dose applied was approximately 0 . 5 g of XEPI applied twice daily for up to 5 days ( i . e . , up to 10 applications total ) [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The safety profile of XEPI in pediatric patients 2 months and older was similar to that of adults [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of XEPI in pediatric patients younger than 2 months of age have not been established [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of XEPI did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
10 OVERDOSAGE Any sign or symptom of overdose , either topically or by accidental ingestion , should be treated symptomatically .
No specific antidote is known .
11 DESCRIPTION XEPI contains ozenoxacin , a quinolone antimicrobial .
It is intended for topical use only .
The chemical name of ozenoxacin is 1 - Cyclopropyl - 8 - methyl - 7 - ( 5 - methyl - 6 - methylamino - pyridin - 3 - yl ) - 4 - oxo - 1 , 4 - dihydro - quinoline - 3 - carboxylic acid .
Ozenoxacin , a white to pale - yellow crystalline solid , has a molecular formula of C21H21N3O3 , and a molecular weight of 363 . 41 .
The chemical structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Each gram of cream contains 10 mg of ozenoxacin ( 1 % w / w ) and the following inactive ingredients : benzoic acid , octyldodecanol , peglicol 5 oleate , pegoxol 7 stearate , propylene glycol , purified water , stearyl alcohol .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action XEPI is an antimicrobial drug [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure - Response Relationship The exposure response relationship for ozenoxacin following topical application has not been studied , however ; a relationship is unlikely because systemic exposure following topical application is negligible [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Four pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in 110 patients utilizing varying strengths of ozenoxacin cream , up to 2 % ( twice the concentration of the marketed formulation ) .
Three of these studies assessed systemic absorption in healthy subjects and in subjects with impetigo .
These studies were conducted with either single or repeated application of up to 1 g ozenoxacin cream to intact or abraded skin ( up to 200 cm2 surface area ) .
No systemic absorption was observed in 84 of 86 subjects , and negligible systemic absorption was observed at the level of detection ( 0 . 489 ng / mL ) in 2 subjects .
Distribution Plasma protein binding of [ 14 C ] - ozenoxacin was moderate ( ~ 80 to 85 % ) and did not appear to be dependent on concentration .
Since negligible systemic absorption was observed in clinical studies , tissue distribution has not been investigated in humans .
Elimination Metabolism : Ozenoxacin was not metabolized in the presence of fresh human skin discs and was minimally metabolized in human hepatocytes .
Excretion : Studies have not been investigated in humans due to the negligible systemic absorption observed in clinical studies .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Ozenoxacin is a quinolone antimicrobial drug .
The mechanism of action involves the inhibition of bacterial DNA replication enzymes , DNA gyrase A and topoisomerase IV .
Ozenoxacin has been shown to be bactericidal against S . aureus and S . pyogenes organisms .
Resistance The mechanism of quinolone resistance can arise through mutations of one or more of the genes that encode DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV .
Resistant organisms will typically carry a combination of mutations within gyrA and parC subunits .
Overall the frequency of resistant mutants selected by ozenoxacin is ≤ 10 - 10 .
Interaction with Other Antimicrobials Ozenoxacin has been tested in combination with 17 other commonly used antimicrobial agents against S . aureus and S . pyogenes .
Antagonism interactions with ozenoxacin were observed with ciprofloxacin against S . aureus .
Antimicrobial Activity Ozenoxacin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] : Gram - positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ( including methicillin - resistant isolates ) Streptococcus pyogenes 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted with ozenoxacin .
Ozenoxacin demonstrated no genotoxicity when evaluated in vitro for gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the Ames test , mouse lymphoma cell assay , or when evaluated in vivo in a rat micronucleus test with demonstrated systemic exposure .
Oral doses of ozenoxacin did not affect mating and fertility in male and female rats treated up to 500 mg / kg / day ( about 8500 and 16 , 000 times respectively , the maximum human plasma concentration seen with dermal application of ozenoxacin 1 % cream ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of XEPI for the treatment of impetigo was evaluated in two multi - center , randomized , double - blind placebo controlled clinical trials ( Trial 1 , ( NCT01397461 ) and Trial 2 , ( NCT02090764 ) ) .
Seven - hundred twenty - three ( 723 ) subjects two months of age and older with an affected body surface area of up to 100 cm2 , and not exceeding 2 % for subjects aged 2 months to 11 years were randomized to XEPI or placebo .
Subjects applied XEPI or placebo twice daily for 5 days .
Subjects with underlying skin disease ( e . g . , preexisting eczematous dermatitis ) , skin trauma , clinical evidence of secondary infection , or systemic signs and symptoms of infection ( such as fever ) , were excluded from these studies .
Overall clinical success was defined as no need for additional antimicrobial therapy of the baseline affected area ( s ) and absence / reduction in clinical signs and symptoms assessed at the end of therapy ( Day 6 - 7 ) , as follows : absence of exudates / pus , crusting , tissue warmth , and pain ; and erythema / inflammation , tissue edema , and itching assessed as less than mild in Trial 1 ; and absence of blistering , exudates / pus , crusting , and itching / pain , and mild or improved erythema / inflammation in Trial 2 .
