Make a second seal between the first seal or knot and the " Y " .
Various methods may be used to seal tubing .
2 . 16 .
Release pressure on the donor ' s arm and remove the needle into the needle safety device following the device instructions provided on the reverse side .

To prevent the blood from clotting in the tubing , work quickly as possible .
Leave an adequate length of tubing containing the well - mixed anticoagulated whole blood attached to the collection bag .
2 . 17 . 2 .
Or , to maximize collection recovery , strip the tubing , mix well and seal tubing close to the collection bag without refilling .
To prevent the blood from clotting in the tubing , work quickly as possible .
Remove tubing from collection bag .
2 . 18 .
The blood filtration is executed according to the following operation .
( see Fig . 3 and Fig . 4 ) 2 . 18 . 1 .
NOTE : Wait 1 hour after collection before filtering .
Filtration can be accomplished when blood is stored at room temperature for up to eight hours after collection .
2 . 18 . 2 .
NOTE : The band guides used to bundle the coiled tubing to prevent entanglement during shipping should be removed prior to filtration ( not depicted ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 2 . 19 .
Mix the unfiltered whole blood unit by inverting the collection bag # 1 ( pre - filter bag ) several times .
2 . 20 .
Hang the collection bag # 1 , and extend the filtration set to 85 ± 2 . 5 cm or 33 . 5 ± 1 inch .
Verify that the filter is vertical and ensure all tubing is freely suspended .
Position and support bags # 2 on a flat surface ( Fig . 4 ) .
2 . 20 . 1 .
NOTE : This distance is measured from the outlet of the collection bag to the position of the supported bags as indicated in Fig . 4 .
2 . 20 . 2 .
NOTE : Verify tubing has been removed from the tube guides and extends freely .
2 . 21 .
Break the CLIKTIP at the outlet of the collection bag # 1 , and start filtration .

2 . 22 .
Filtration ends when the collection bag is empty or blood flow has stopped .
Close the WHITE clamp above the filter .
2 . 23 .
Expel air through the bypass line and back into the empty collection bag # 1 by holding the primary bag # 2 upright so that the air will be closest to the ports .
Gently squeeze the primary bag containing the leukoreduced whole blood until filtered blood reaches the " Y " below the filter .
To ensure ease of air removal ensure primary bag # 2 is below the filter outlet .
2 . 24 .
Open the WHITE clamp .
2 . 25 .
Recovery of filtered Whole Blood is complete when the collection bag and the inlet side of the filter have drained or blood flow has stopped .
Close the WHITE clamp .

Issued 2018 - 12 N - LCD506A6 2 PROCEDURE FOR USE OF DonorCare ® Needle Guard This device is for use by trained individuals .
Intended Use The DonorCare ® Needle Guard is incorporated onto the donor tubing to shield the needle immediately after withdrawal from the donor .
Single Use Only .
Preparation 1 .
Move the DonorCare on the tubing ensuring that it slides easily and the arrow is pointing toward the needle hub .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 2 .
Ensure that the three lock points on the DonorCare are locked closed .
Whole Blood Collection 3 .
Perform the phlebotomy as per your institution ' s standard operating procedures .
4 .
Slide the DonorCare over the needle hub so that it covers approximately one half to two thirds of the needle hub .
5 .
Stabilize the DonorCare to the arm by placing a piece of tape over the front end so that the tape does not extend over the front of the DonorCare .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Withdrawal of Needle Important The DonorCare must be held stationary while the needle is withdrawn into it .
Caution The needle must be fully shielded by DonorCare to prevent accidental injury .
6 .
Hold gauze over the venipuncture site with finger tips without exerting pressure .
Hold the sides of the DonorCare near the front with the index finger and thumb of the same hand .
7 .
With the other hand , hold the donor tubing close behind the DonorCare .
Note : A hemostat may be placed on the tubing behind the DonorCare when the blood collection is complete .
This will help to prevent blood drops from forming .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 8 .
Pull tubing smoothly and swiftly with one motion until the needle is locked in place inside the DonorCare .
9 .
Confirm that the needle is locked by : a . Listening for two ' clicks ' as the needle is drawn into DonorCare .
b .
If the clicks are not heard as the needle is drawn into the DonorCare , continue to pull firmly on the tubing to assure needle is fully withdrawn into DonorCare .
10 .
Visually check that the needle is fully shielded by DonorCare before removing from the donor ' s arm .
11 .
Remove the tape from the DonorCare and arm .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 .
Apply pressure to the gauze covering the venipuncture site .
Warning Do not place fingers at the opening of DonorCare after removal from the donor ' s arm .
Difficult Phlebotomy ( Examples may include : Slow blood flow , deep or fine vein , steep angle ) It may be necessary to delay placing the DonorCare over the needle hub until the end of the blood collection .
In such situations : Leave the DonorCare on the tubing behind the needle hub .
At the end of the blood collection carefully remove the tape from the needle hub and slide the DonorCare over the hub so that it covers approximately one half to two thirds of the needle hub .
Withdraw the needle into the DonorCare as stated in steps 6 .
through 12 .
