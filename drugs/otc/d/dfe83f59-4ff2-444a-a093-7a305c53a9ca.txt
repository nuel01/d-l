8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action , IMJUDO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available data on the use of IMJUDO in pregnant women .
In animal studies , CTLA - 4 blockade is associated with increased risk of immune - mediated rejection of the developing fetus and fetal death ( see Data ) .
Human immunoglobulin G2 ( IgG2 ) is known to cross the placental barrier ; therefore , IMJUDO has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus .
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In a reproduction study , administration of tremelimumab - actl to pregnant cynomolgus monkeys during the period of organogenesis was not associated with maternal toxicity or effects on embryo - fetal development at exposure levels approximately 4 to 31 - times higher than those observed at a recommended dose range of 75 mg to 300 mg based on area under the curve ( AUC ) .
CTLA - 4 plays a role in maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the fetus to preserve pregnancy and in immune regulation of the newborn .
In a murine model of pregnancy , CTLA - 4 blockade resulted in increased resorptions and reduced live fetuses .
Mated genetically engineered mice heterozygous for CTLA - 4 ( CTLA - 4 + / - ) gave birth to CTLA - 4 + / - offspring and offspring deficient in CTLA - 4 ( homozygous negative , CTLA - 4 - / - ) that appeared healthy at birth .
The CTLA - 4 - / - homozygous negative offspring developed signs of a lymphoproliferative disorder and died by 3 to 4 weeks of age with multiorgan tissue destruction .
Based on its mechanism of action , fetal exposure to tremelimumab - actl may increase the risk of developing immune - mediated disorders or altering the normal immune response .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of tremelimumab - actl in human milk , its effects on a breastfed child , or on milk production .
Maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk .
The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure in the breastfed child to IMJUDO are unknown .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with IMJUDO and for 3 months after the last dose .
Refer to the Prescribing Information for agents administered in combination with IMJUDO for breastfeeding recommendations , as appropriate .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential IMJUDO can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with IMJUDO .
Contraception Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IMJUDO and for 3 months after the last dose .
Refer to the Prescribing Information for the agents administered in combination with IMJUDO for recommended contraception duration , as appropriate .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of tremelimumab - actl have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 393 patients with uHCC treated with IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab , 50 % of patients were 65 years or older and 13 % of patients were 75 years or older .
No overall differences in safety or efficacy of IMJUDO have been observed between patients 65 years or older and younger adult patients .
Of the 330 patients with metastatic NSCLC treated with IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab and platinum - based chemotherapy , 143 ( 43 % ) patients were 65 years or older and 35 ( 11 % ) patients were 75 years or older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects .
11 DESCRIPTION Tremelimumab - actl , a cytotoxic T - lymphocyte - associated antigen 4 ( CTLA - 4 ) blocking human IgG2 monoclonal antibody , is produced by recombinant DNA technology in NS0 cell suspension culture and has a molecular weight of 149 kDa .
IMJUDO ( tremelimumab - actl ) injection is a sterile , preservative - free , clear to slightly opalescent , colorless to slightly yellow solution , in a single - dose vial for intravenous infusion after dilution .
IMJUDO contains tremelimumab - actl at a concentration of 20 mg / mL in either a 25 mg / 1 . 25 mL or a 300 mg / 15 mL single - dose vial .
Each mL contains 20 mg of tremelimumab - actl , and edetate disodium ( 0 . 09 mg ) , histidine ( 0 . 68 mg ) , L histidine hydrochloride monohydrate ( 3 . 3 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 0 . 2 mg ) , trehalose ( 76 mg ) , and Water for Injection , USP .
The pH is approximately 5 . 5 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action CTLA - 4 is a negative regulator of T - cell activity .
Tremelimumab -- actl is a monoclonal antibody that binds to CTLA - 4 and blocks the interaction with its ligands CD80 and CD86 , releasing CTLA - 4 - mediated inhibition of T - cell activation .
In synergistic mouse tumor models , blocking CTLA - 4 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth and increased proliferation of T cells in tumors .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The exposure - response relationship and time course of pharmacodynamic response for the safety and effectiveness of tremelimumab - actl have not been fully characterized .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab - actl was studied in patients with other solid tumors following administration of doses 1 mg / kg , 3 mg / kg , and 10 mg / kg ( 1 - to 10 - times the approved recommended dosage ) administered once every 4 weeks for 4 doses .
The pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab - actl as a single dose of 300 mg were evaluated in patients with HCC .
The AUC of tremelimumab - actl increased proportionally from 1 mg / kg to 10 mg / kg every 4 weeks ( 1 to 10 - times the approved recommended dosage ) and steady state was achieved at approximately 12 weeks .
Distribution The geometric mean ( % coefficient of variation [ CV % ] ) of tremelimumab - actl for central ( V1 ) and peripheral ( V2 ) volume of distribution was 3 . 45 ( 24 % ) and 2 . 66 ( 34 % ) L , respectively .
Elimination The geometric mean ( CV % ) terminal half - life of tremelimumab - actl was 16 . 9 days ( 19 % ) after a single dose and 18 . 2 days ( 19 % ) during steady state .
The geometric mean ( CV % ) clearance of tremelimumab - actl was 0 . 286 L / day ( 32 % ) after a single dose and 0 . 263 L / day ( 32 % ) during steady state .
Specific Populations There were no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab - actl based on body weight ( 34 to149 kg ) , age ( 18 to 87 years ) , sex , race ( White , Black , Asian , Native Hawaiian , Pacific Islander , or American Indian ) , serum albumin levels ( 0 . 3 to 396 g / L ) , lactate dehydrogenase levels ( 12 to 5570 U / L ) , soluble PD - L1 ( 67 to 349 pg / mL ) , tumor type ( NSCLC , HCC ) , organ dysfunction including mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr 30 to 89 mL / min ) , and mild to moderate hepatic impairment ( bilirubin < 3 x ULN and any AST ) .
The effect of severe renal impairment ( CLcr 15 to 29 mL / min ) or severe hepatic impairment ( bilirubin > 3 x ULN and any AST ) on the pharmacokinetics of tremelimumab - actl is unknown .
12 . 6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti - drug antibodies ( ADA ) is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of ADA in the studies described below with the incidence of ADA in other studies , including those of tremelimumab - actl .
In the HIMALAYA study , of the 182 patients who were treated with a single dose of tremelimumab - actl in combination with durvalumab once in every 4 weeks therapy and evaluable for the presence of ADAs against tremelimumab - actl at predose week 0 and week 4 , 11 % ( 20 / 182 ) of patients tested positive for anti - tremelimumab - actl antibodies .
Among the 20 patients who tested positive for ADAs 40 % ( 8 / 20 ) tested positive for neutralizing antibodies against tremelimumab - actl .
There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti - tremelimumab antibodies on the pharmacokinetics or safety of tremelimumab - actl ; however , the effect of ADAs and neutralizing antibodies on the effectiveness of tremelimumab - actl is unknown .
In the POSEIDON study , of the 278 ADA - evaluable patients who were treated with IMJUDO 75 mg for up to five doses in combination with durvalumab 1 , 500 mg and platinum - based chemotherapy every 3 weeks and evaluated for presence of ADAs against tremelimumab - actl at pre - dose week 0 , week 3 , and week 12 , 14 % ( 38 / 278 ) of patients tested positive for anti - tremelimumab - actl antibodies .
Among the 38 patients who tested positive for ADAs , 82 % ( 31 / 38 ) tested positive for neutralizing antibodies against tremelimumab - actl .
There was no identified clinically significant effect of anti - tremelimumab - actl antibodies on pharmacokinetics or safety of tremelimumab - actl , however , the effect of ADAs on effectiveness of tremelimumab - actl is unknown .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic and genotoxic potential of tremelimumab - actl have not been evaluated .
Animal fertility studies have not been conducted with tremelimumab - actl , .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC ) The efficacy of IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab was evaluated in the HIMALAYA study ( NCT03298451 ) , a randomized ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) , open - label , multicenter study in patients with confirmed uHCC who had not received prior systemic treatment for HCC .
Patients were randomized to one of two investigational arms ( IMJUDO plus durvalumab or durvalumab ) or sorafenib .
Study treatment consisted of IMJUDO as a one - time single intravenous infusion of 300 mg in combination with durvalumab 1 , 500 mg on the same day , followed by durvalumab every 4 weeks ; durvalumab 1 , 500 mg every 4 weeks ; or sorafenib 400 mg given orally twice daily , until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
The efficacy assessment of IMJUDO is based on patients randomized to the IMJUDO plus durvalumab arm versus the sorafenib arm .
Randomization was stratified by macrovascular invasion ( MVI ) ( yes or no ) , etiology of liver disease ( hepatitis B virus vs . hepatitis C virus vs . others ) and ECOG performance status ( 0 vs . 1 ) .

The study excluded patients with co - infection of viral hepatitis B and hepatitis C ; active or prior documented gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding within 12 months ; ascites requiring non - pharmacologic intervention within 6 months ; hepatic encephalopathy within 12 months before the start of treatment ; active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders .
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was not mandated prior to enrollment but adequate endoscopic therapy , according to institutional standards , was required for patients with a history of esophageal variceal bleeding or those assessed as high risk for esophageal variceal bleeding by the treating physician .
Study treatment was permitted beyond disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and was deriving clinical benefit as determined by the investigator .
The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival ( OS ) between the IMJUDO plus durvalumab arm versus the sorafenib arm .
Additional efficacy outcomes were investigator - assessed progression - free survival ( PFS ) , objective response rate ( ORR ) and duration of response ( DoR ) according to RECIST v1 . 1 .
Tumor assessments were conducted every 8 weeks for the first 12 months and then every 12 weeks thereafter .
The baseline demographics of the IMJUDO plus durvalumab and sorafenib arms were as follows : male ( 85 % ) , age < 65 years ( 50 % ) , median age of 65 years ( range : 18 to 88 years ) , White ( 46 % ) , Asian ( 49 % ) , Black or African American ( 2 % ) , Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander ( 0 . 1 % ) , race Unknown ( 2 % ) , Hispanic or Latino ( 5 % ) , Not Hispanic or Latino ( 94 % ) , ethnicity Unknown ( 1 % ) , ECOG PS 0 ( 62 % ) ; Child - Pugh Class score A ( 99 % ) , macrovascular invasion ( 26 % ) , extrahepatic spread ( 53 % ) , viral etiology hepatitis B ( 31 % ) , hepatitis C ( 27 % ) , uninfected ( 42 % ) .

Kaplan - Meier curve of OS [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Generic Section Metastic NSCLC – POSEIDON The efficacy of IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab and platinum - based chemotherapy in previously untreated metastatic NSCLC patients with no sensitizing epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation or anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) genomic tumor aberrations was investigated in POSEIDON , a randomized , multicenter , active - controlled , open - label trial ( NCT03164616 ) .
Eligible patients had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status of 0 or 1 and must have had no prior chemotherapy or any other systemic therapy for metastatic NSCLC .
Choice of platinum - based chemotherapy was at the Investigator ’ s discretion , taking into consideration the calculated creatinine clearance .
Patients with active and / or untreated brain metastases ; a history of active primary immunodeficiency ; autoimmune disorders including active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorders ; use of systemic immunosuppressants within 14 days before the first dose of the treatment except physiological dose of systemic corticosteroids were ineligible .
Randomization was stratified by tumor cells ( TC ) PD - L1 expression ( TC ≥ 50 % vs . TC < 50 % ) , disease stage ( Stage IVA vs . Stage IVB ) , and histology ( non - squamous vs . squamous ) .
Patients were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to receive IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab and platinum - based chemotherapy according to the regimens listed below , durvalumab and platinum - based chemotherapy ( an unapproved regimen for metastatic NSCLC ) , or platinum - based chemotherapy .
The evaluation of efficacy for metastatic NSCLC relied on comparison between : • • IMJUDO 75 mg ( or 1 mg / kg for patients < 30 kg ) with durvalumab 1 , 500 mg and platinum - based chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles , followed by durvalumab 1 , 500 mg every 4 weeks as a single agent .
A fifth dose of IMJUDO 75 mg ( or 1 mg / kg for patients < 30 kg ) was given at Week 16 in combination with durvalumab dose 6 .
• • Platinum - based chemotherapy every 3 weeks as monotherapy for 4 cycles .
Patients could receive an additional 2 cycles ( a total of 6 cycles post - randomization ) , as clinically indicated , at Investigator ’ s discretion .
Patients received IMJUDO and durvalumab in combination with one of the following platinum - based chemotherapy regimens : • • Non - squamous NSCLC • • Pemetrexed 500 mg / m2 with carboplatin AUC 5 - 6 or cisplatin 75 mg / m2 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles • • Squamous NSCLC • • Gemcitabine 1 , 000 or 1 , 250 mg / m2 on Days 1 and 8 with cisplatin 75 mg / m2 or carboplatin AUC 5 - 6 on Day 1 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles • • Non - squamous and Squamous NSCLC • • Nab - paclitaxel 100 mg / m2 on Days 1 , 8 , and 15 with carboplatin AUC 5 - 6 on Day 1 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles IMJUDO was given up to a maximum of 5 doses .
Durvalumab and histology - based pemetrexed continued every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Administration of durvalumab monotherapy was permitted beyond disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as determined by the Investigator .
Patients with disease progression during durvalumab monotherapy were given the option to be retreated with 4 additional cycles of IMJUDO in combination with durvalumab .
Tumor assessments were performed at Week 6 , Week 12 , and then every 8 weeks thereafter .
The major efficacy outcome measures were progression free survival ( PFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) of IMJUDO and durvalumab in combination with platinum - based chemotherapy compared to platinum - based chemotherapy alone .
Additional efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate ( ORR ) and duration of response ( DoR ) .
PFS , ORR , and DoR were assessed using Blinded Independent Central Review ( BICR ) according to RECIST v1 . 1 .
A total of 675 patients were randomized to receive either IMJUDO with durvalumab and platinum - based chemotherapy ( n = 338 ) or platinum - based chemotherapy ( n = 337 ) .
The median age was 63 years ( range : 27 to 87 ) , 46 % of patients age ≥ 65 years , 77 % male , 57 % White , 34 % Asian , 0 . 3 % Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander , 3 % American Indian or Alaska Native , 2 % Black or African American , 4 % Other Race , 79 % former or current smoker , 34 % ECOG PS 0 , and 66 % ECOG PS 1 .
Thirty - six percent had squamous histology , 63 % non - squamous histology , 29 % PD - L1 expression TC ≥ 50 % , 71 % PD - L1 expression TC < 50 % .
Efficacy results are summarized in Table 9 and Figure 2 .
