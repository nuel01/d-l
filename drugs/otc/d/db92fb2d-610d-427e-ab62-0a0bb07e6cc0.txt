CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ZINC has been identified as a cofactor for over 70 different enzymes , including alkaline phosphatase , lactic dehydrogenase and both RNA and DNA polymerase .
Zinc facilitates wound healing , helps maintain normal growth rates , normal skin hydration and senses of taste and smell .
Providing zinc during TPN prevents development of the following deficiency symptoms : parakeratosis , hypogeusia , anorexia , dysosmia , geophagia , hypogonadism , growth retardation and hepatosplenomegaly .
At plasma levels below 20 mcg zinc / 100 mL , dermatitis followed by alopecia has been reported for TPN patients .
COPPER is essential as a cofactor for serum ceruloplasmin , an oxidase necessary for proper formation of the iron carrier protein , transferrin .
Copper also helps maintain normal rates of red and white blood cell formation .
Scorbutic type bone changes seen in infants fed exclusively with copper - poor cow ' s milk are believed due to decreased activity of ascorbate oxidase , a cuproenzyme .
Providing copper during TPN prevents development of the following deficiency symptoms : leukopenia , neutropenia , anemia , depressed ceruloplasmin levels , impaired transferrin formation and secondary iron deficiency .
MANGANESE is an activator for enzymes such as polysaccharide polymerase , liver arginase , cholinesterase and pyruvate carboxylase .
Providing manganese during TPN prevents development of the following deficiency symptoms : nausea and vomiting , weight loss , dermatitis , and changes in growth and color of hair .
CHROMIUM ( trivalent ) is part of glucose tolerance factor , an activator of insulin - mediated reactions .
Chromium helps to maintain normal glucose metabolism and peripheral nerve function .
Providing chromium during TPN prevents development of the following deficiency symptoms : impaired glucose tolerance , ataxia , peripheral neuropathy and a confusional state similar to mild / moderate hepatic encephalopathy .
SELENIUM is part of glutathione peroxidase which protects cell components from oxidative damage due to peroxides produced in cellular metabolism .
Prolonged TPN support in humans has resulted in selenium deficiency symptoms which include muscle pain and tenderness .
The symptoms have been reported to respond to supplementation of TPN solutions with selenium .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE This formulation is indicated for use as a supplement to intravenous solutions given for TPN .
Administration of the solution in TPN solutions helps to maintain plasma levels of zinc , copper , manganese , selenium and chromium and to prevent depletion of endogenous stores of these trace elements and subsequent deficiency symptoms .
CONTRAINDICATIONS MULTITRACE 速 - 5 should not be given undiluted by direct injection into a peripheral vein because of the potential of infusion phlebitis .
WARNINGS Copper and Manganese are eliminated via the bile .
In patients with severe liver dysfunction and / or biliary tract obstruction , decreasing or omitting copper and manganese supplements entirely may be necessary .
This product contains aluminum that may be toxic .
Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired .
Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature , and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions , which contain aluminum .
Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function , including premature neonates , who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg / kg / day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity .
Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration .
PRECAUTIONS Before administering MULTITRACE 速 - 5 in TPN solutions , the physician must assess the metabolic requirements for trace elements and disease state of the patient .
Frequent determinations of serum levels of the various trace elements are suggested as a guideline for adjusting the dosage or completely omitting the solution .
ZINC is eliminated via the intestine and kidneys .
The possibility of retention should be considered in patients with malfunctioning excretory routes .
COPPER and MANGANESE are eliminated via the bile , therefore the possibility of retention of these elements should be considered in patients with biliary obstruction .
Ancillary routes of MANGANESE excretion , however , include pancreatic juice , or reabsorption into the lumen of duodenum , jejunum , or ileum .
In assessing the contribution of CHROMIUM supplements to maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis , consideration should be given to the possibility that the patient may be diabetic , in which case oral or intravenous antidiabetic medication may be indicated .
As SELENIUM is eliminated in urine and feces , SELENIUM supplements may be adjusted , reduced or omitted in renal dysfunction and / or gastrointestinal malfunction .
In patients receiving blood transfusions , contribution from such transfusions should also be considered .
Frequent selenium plasma level determinations are suggested as a guideline .
In animals , SELENIUM has been reported to enhance the action of Vitamin E and decrease the toxicity of mercury , cadmium , and arsenic .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C : SELENIUM at high dosage levels ( 15 - 30 mcg / egg ) has been reported to have adverse embryological effects among chickens .
There are however no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women .
MULTITRACE 速 - 5 should be used during pregnancy only if potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Presence of SELENIUM in placenta and umbilical cord blood has been reported in humans .
ADVERSE REACTIONS The amounts of ZINC , COPPER , MANGANESE , CHROMIUM and SELENIUM in the solution are very small and toxicity symptoms due to these trace elements at suggested dosage levels are considered unlikely to occur .
OVERDOSAGE Symptoms of ZINC overdosage resulting from oral ingestion of Zinc Sulfate in large amounts have resulted in death .
Symptoms included nausea , vomiting , dehydration , electrolyte imbalances , dizziness , abdominal pain , lethargy and incoordination .
Single intravenous doses of 1 to 2 mg zinc / kg body weight have been given to adult leukemic patients without toxic manifestations .
Normal plasma levels for Zinc vary from approximately 88 to 112 mcg / 100 mL .
Plasma levels sufficient to produce symptoms of toxic manifestations are not known .
Calcium supplements may confer a protective effect against Zinc toxicity .
Symptoms of COPPER toxicity reported in literature include prostration , behavior change , diarrhea , progressive marasmus , hypotonia , photophobia and peripheral edema .
D - penicillamine has been reported effective as an antidote .
MANGANESE toxicity has not been reported in patients receiving TPN .
Neither have reports of manganese toxicity from excessive intake in foods and / or beverages been published .
Symptoms of CHROMIUM toxicity include nausea , vomiting , ulcers of gastrointestinal tract , renal and hepatic damage , and abnormalities of the central nervous system culminating in convulsions and coma .
Trivalent Chromium administered intravenously to TPN patients has been shown to be nontoxic when given at dosage levels up to 250 mcg / day for two consecutive weeks .
Chronic toxicity in humans resulting from exposure to SELENIUM in industrial environments , intake of foods grown in seleniferous soils , use of selenium contaminated water , and application of cosmetics containing selenium has been reported in literature .
Toxicity symptoms include hair loss , weakened nails , dermatitis , dental defects , gastrointestinal disorders , nervousness , mental depression , metallic taste , vomiting , and garlic odor of breath and sweat .
Acute poisoning due to ingestion of large amounts of selenium compounds has resulted in death with histopathological changes including fulminating peripheral vascular collapse , internal vascular congestion , diffusely hemorrhagic , congested and edematous lungs , brick - red color gastric mucosa .
The death was preceded by coma .
No effective antidote to selenium poisoning in humans is known .
Animal studies have shown casein and linseed oil in feeds , reduced glutathione , arsenic , magnesium sulfate , and bromobenzene to afford limited protection .
