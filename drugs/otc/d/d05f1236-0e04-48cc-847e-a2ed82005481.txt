( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Central Nervous System ( CNS ) Adverse Reactions : Elderly patients and patients with renal impairment at increased risk ; reduce the dosage .
( 2 . 2 , 5 . 1 , 8 . 5 , 8 . 6 ) • GI Malignancy : Absence of GI symptoms does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy ; evaluate prior to initiating therapy .
( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Central Nervous System Adverse Reactions Central nervous system ( CNS ) adverse reactions , including confusion , delirium , hallucinations , disorientation , agitation , seizures , and lethargy , have been reported in elderly patients and patients with moderate and severe renal impairment treated with famotidine .
Since famotidine blood levels are higher in patients with renal impairment than in patients with normal renal function , dosage adjustments are recommended in patients with renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 2 Concurrent Gastric Malignancy In adults , symptomatic response to therapy with famotidine does not preclude the presence of gastric malignancy .
Consider evaluation for gastric malignancy in adult patients who have a suboptimal response or an early symptomatic relapse after completing treatment with famotidine .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions are : headache , dizziness , constipation , and diarrhea .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Aurobindo Pharma USA , Inc . at 1 - 866 - 850 - 2876 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Famotidine was studied in 7 U . S . and international placebo - and active - controlled trials in approximately 2500 patients [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
A total of 1442 patients were treated with famotidine , including 302 treated with 40 mg twice daily , 456 treated with 20 mg twice daily , 461 treated with 40 mg once daily , and 396 treated with 20 mg once daily .
The population was 17 to 91 years old , fairly well distributed between gender and race ; however , the predominant race treated was Caucasian .
The following adverse reactions occurred in greater than or equal to 1 % of famotidine - treated patients : headache , dizziness and constipation .
The following other adverse reactions were reported in less than 1 % of patients in clinical trials : Body as a Whole : fever , asthenia , fatigue Cardiovascular : palpitations Gastrointestinal : elevated liver enzymes , vomiting , nausea , abdominal discomfort , anorexia , dry mouth Hematologic : thrombocytopenia Hypersensitivity : orbital edema , rash , conjunctival injection , bronchospasm Musculoskeletal : musculoskeletal pain , arthralgia Nervous System / Psychiatric : seizure , hallucinations , depression , anxiety , decreased libido , insomnia , somnolence Skin : pruritus , dry skin , flushing Special Senses : tinnitus , taste disorder Other : impotence 6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of famotidine .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Cardiovascular : arrhythmia , AV block , prolonged QT interval Gastrointestinal : cholestatic jaundice , hepatitis Hematologic : agranulocytosis , pancytopenia , leukopenia Hypersensitivity : anaphylaxis , angioedema , facial edema , urticaria Musculoskeletal : rhabdomyolysis , muscle cramps Nervous System / Psychiatric : confusion , agitation , paresthesia Respiratory : interstitial pneumonia Skin : toxic epidermal necrolysis / Stevens - Johnson syndrome 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption : Systemic exposure of the concomitant drug may be significantly reduced leading to loss of efficacy .
See full prescribing information for a list of interacting drugs .
( 7 . 1 ) • Tizanidine ( CYP1A2 ) Substrate : Potential for substantial increases in blood concentrations of tizanidine resulting in hypotension , bradycardia or excessive drowsiness ; avoid concomitant use , if possible .
( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption Famotidine can reduce the absorption of other drugs , due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity , leading to loss of efficacy of the concomitant drug .
Concomitant administration of famotidine with dasatinib , delavirdine mesylate , cefditoren , and fosamprenavir is not recommended .
See the prescribing information for other drugs dependent on gastric pH for absorption for administration instructions , including atazanavir , erlotinib , ketoconazole , itraconazole , ledipasvir / sofosbuvir , nilotinib , and rilpivirine .
7 . 2 Tizanidine ( CYP1A2 Substrate ) Although not studied clinically , famotidine is considered a weak CYP1A2 inhibitor and may lead to substantial increases in blood concentrations of tizanidine , a CYP1A2 substrate .
Avoid concomitant use with famotidine .
If concomitant use is necessary , monitor for hypotension , bradycardia or excessive drowsiness .
Refer to the full prescribing information for tizanidine .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Geriatric Use : Use the lowest effective dose for an elderly patient and monitor renal function .
( 2 . 2 , 5 . 1 , 8 . 5 ) • Renal Impairment : Risk of CNS adverse reactions and QT prolongation in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment ; reduce the dosage .
( 2 . 2 , 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data with H2 - receptor antagonists , including famotidine , in pregnant women are insufficient to establish a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , no adverse development effects were observed with oral administration of famotidine at doses up to approximately 243 and 122 times , respectively , the recommended human dose of 80 mg per day for the treatment of erosive esophagitis ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Reproductive studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at oral doses of up to 2000 and 500 mg / kg / day , respectively , and in both species at intravenous doses of up to 200 mg / kg / day , and have revealed no significant evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to famotidine .
While no direct fetotoxic effects have been observed , sporadic abortions occurring only in mothers displaying marked decreased food intake were seen in some rabbits at oral doses of 200 mg / kg / day ( about 49 times the recommended human dose of 80 mg per day , based on body surface area ) or higher .
There are , however , no adequate or well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are limited data available on the presence of famotidine in human breast milk .
There were no effects on the breastfed infant .
There are no data on famotidine effects on milk production .
Famotidine is present in the milk of lactating rats ( see Data ) .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for famotidine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from PEPCID or from the underlying maternal condition .
Data Animal Data Transient growth depression was observed in young rats suckling from mothers treated with maternotoxic doses of famotidine at least 600 times the usual human dose .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of famotidine have been established in pediatric patients for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease ( i . e . , duodenal ulcer , gastric ulcer ) and GERD ( i . e . , symptomatic nonerosive GERD , erosive esophagitis as diagnosed by endoscopy ) .
The use of famotidine and the recommended dosage of famotidine in these pediatric patients is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies of famotidine in adults and published pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data in pediatric patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 , 12 . 3 ) ] .
In pediatric patients , the safety and effectiveness for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions and reduction of risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence have not been established .
Famotidine 20 and 40 mg tablets are not recommended for use in pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg because these tablet strengths exceed the recommended dose for these patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
For pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg , consider another famotidine formulation ( e . g . , oral suspension , lower dose tablet ) .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 1442 famotidine - treated patients in clinical studies , approximately 10 % were 65 and older .
In these studies , no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients .
In postmarketing experience , CNS adverse reactions have been reported in elderly patients with and without renal impairment receiving famotidine [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Famotidine is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of adverse reactions to famotidine may be greater in elderly patients , particularly those with impaired renal function [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
In general , use the lowest effective dose of famotidine for an elderly patient and monitor renal function [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment CNS adverse reactions and prolonged QT intervals have been reported in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
The clearance of famotidine is reduced in adults with moderate and severe renal impairment compared to adults with normal renal function [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild renal impairment ( creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL / minute ) .
Dosage reduction is recommended in adult and pediatric patients greater than or equal to 40 kg with moderate or severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance less than 60 mL / minute ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE The types of adverse reactions in overdosage of famotidine are similar to the adverse reactions encountered with use of recommended dosages [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In the event of overdosage , treatment should be symptomatic and supportive .
Unabsorbed material should be removed from the gastrointestinal tract , the patient should be monitored , and supportive therapy should be employed .
Due to low binding to plasma proteins , famotidine is eliminated by hemodialysis .
There is limited experience on the usefulness of hemodialysis as a treatment for famotidine overdosage .
11 DESCRIPTION The active ingredient in famotidine tablets USP is a histamine - 2 ( H2 ) receptor antagonist .
Famotidine is N ′ ( aminosulfonyl ) - 3 - [ [ [ 2 - [ ( diaminomethylene ) amino ] - 4 - thiazolyl ] methyl ] thio ] propanimidamide .
The molecular formula of famotidine is C8H15N7O2S3 and its molecular weight is 337 . 43 .
Its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Each famotidine tablet for oral administration contains either 20 mg or 40 mg of famotidine USP and the following inactive ingredients : carnauba wax , corn starch , hydroxypropyl cellulose , hypromellose , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose , sodium starch glycolate , talc , and titanium dioxide .
In addition the 20 mg tablets contain red iron oxide , and yellow iron oxide .
Famotidine USP is a white to pale yellowish white crystalline powder that is freely soluble in glacial acetic acid , slightly soluble in methanol , very slightly soluble in water , and practically insoluble in ethanol .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Famotidine is a competitive inhibitor of histamine - 2 ( H2 ) receptors .
The primary clinically important pharmacologic activity of famotidine is inhibition of gastric secretion .
Both the acid concentration and volume of gastric secretion are suppressed by famotidine , while changes in pepsin secretion are proportional to volume output .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Adults Famotidine inhibited both basal and nocturnal gastric secretion , as well as secretion stimulated by food and pentagastrin .
After oral administration of famotidine , the onset of the antisecretory effect occurred within one hour ; the maximum effect was dose - dependent , occurring within one to three hours .
Duration of inhibition of secretion by doses of 20 mg and 40 mg was 10 to 12 hours .
Single evening oral doses of 20 mg and 40 mg inhibited basal and nocturnal acid secretion in all subjects ; mean nocturnal gastric acid secretion was inhibited by 86 % and 94 % , respectively , for a period of at least 10 hours .
The same doses given in the morning suppressed food - stimulated acid secretion in all subjects .
The mean suppression was 76 % and 84 % , respectively , 3 to 5 hours after administration , and 25 % and 30 % , respectively , 8 to 10 hours after administration .
In some subjects who received the 20 mg dose , however , the antisecretory effect was dissipated within 6 to 8 hours .
There was no cumulative effect with repeated doses .
The nocturnal intragastric pH was raised by evening doses of 20 mg and 40 mg of famotidine to mean values of 5 . 0 and 6 . 4 , respectively .
When famotidine was given after breakfast , the basal daytime interdigestive pH at 3 and 8 hours after 20 mg or 40 mg of famotidine was raised to about 5 .
Famotidine had little or no effect on fasting or postprandial serum gastrin levels .
Gastric emptying and exocrine pancreatic function were not affected by famotidine .
In clinical pharmacology studies , systemic effects of famotidine in the CNS , cardiovascular , respiratory or endocrine systems were not noted .
Also , no anti - androgenic effects were noted .
Serum hormone levels , including prolactin , cortisol , thyroxine ( T4 ) , and testosterone , were not altered after treatment with famotidine .
Pediatric Patients Pharmacodynamics of famotidine , assessed by gastric pH , were evaluated in 5 pediatric patients 2 to 13 years of age using the sigmoid Emax model .
These data suggest that the relationship between serum concentration of famotidine and gastric acid suppression is similar to that observed in adults ( see Table 3 ) .
Table 3 : Serum Concentrations of Famotidine Associated with Gastric Acid Reduction in Famotidine - Treated Pediatric and Adult Patientsa EC50 ( ng / mL ) a Pediatric Patients 26 ± 13 Adults Healthy adult subjects 26 . 5 ± 10 . 3 Adult patients with upper GI bleeding 18 . 7 ± 10 . 8 a Using the Sigmoid Emax model , serum concentrations of famotidine associated with 50 % maximum gastric acid reduction are presented as means ± SD .
In a study examining the effect of famotidine on gastric pH and duration of acid suppression in pediatric patients , four pediatric patients ages 11 to 15 years of age using the oral formulation at a dose of 0 . 5 mg / kg , maintained a gastric pH above 5 for 13 . 5 ± 1 . 8 hours .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Famotidine is incompletely absorbed .
The bioavailability of oral doses is 40 to 45 % .
Bioavailability may be slightly increased by food , or slightly decreased by antacids ; however , these effects are of no clinical consequence .
Peak famotidine plasma levels occur in 1 to 3 hours .
Plasma levels after multiple dosages are similar to those after single doses .
Distribution Fifteen to 20 % of famotidine in plasma is protein bound .
Elimination Metabolism Famotidine undergoes minimal first - pass metabolism .
Twenty - five to 30 % of an oral dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged compound .
The only metabolite identified in humans is the S - oxide .
Excretion Famotidine has an elimination half - life of 2 . 5 to 3 . 5 hours .
Famotidine is eliminated by renal ( 65 to 70 % ) and metabolic ( 30 to 35 % ) routes .
Renal clearance is 250 to 450 mL / minute , indicating some tubular excretion .
Specific Populations Pediatric Patients Bioavailability studies of 8 pediatric patients ( 11 to 15 years of age ) showed a mean oral bioavailability of 0 . 5 compared to adult values of 0 . 42 to 0 . 49 .
Oral doses of 0 . 5 mg per kg achieved AUCs of 580 ± 60 ng • hr / mL in pediatric patients 11 to 15 years of age , compared to 482 ± 181 ng • hr / mL in adults treated with 40 mg orally .
Patients with Renal Impairment In adult patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance less than 30 mL / minute ) , the systemic exposure ( AUC ) of famotidine increased at least 5 - fold .
In patients with moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance between 30 to 60 mL / minute ) , the AUC of famotidine increased at least 2 - fold [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Use in Specific Population ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Drug Interaction Studies Human Organic Anion Transporter ( OAT ) 1 and 3 : In vitro studies indicate that famotidine is a substrate for OAT1 and OAT3 .
Following coadministration of probenecid ( 1500 mg ) , an inhibitor of OAT1 and OAT3 , with a single oral 20 mg dose of famotidine in 8 healthy subjects , the serum AUC0 - 10 h of famotidine increased from 424 to 768 ng ● hr / mL and the maximum serum concentration ( Cmax ) increased from 73 to 113 ng / mL .
Renal clearance , urinary excretion rate and amount of famotidine excreted unchanged in urine were decreased .
The clinical relevance of this interaction is unknown .
Multidrug and Toxin Extrusion Protein 1 ( MATE - 1 ) : An in vitro study showed that famotidine is an inhibitor of MATE - 1 .
However , no clinically significant interaction with metformin , a substrate for MATE - 1 , was observed .
CYP1A2 : Famotidine is a weak CYP1A2 inhibitor .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenic potential of famotidine was assessed in a 106 - week oral carcinogenicity study in rats and a 92 - week oral carcinogenicity study in mice .
In the 106 - week study in rats and the 92 - week study in mice at oral doses of up to 2000 mg / kg / day ( approximately 243 and 122 times , respectively , based on body surface area , the recommended human dose of 80 mg per day for the treatment of erosive esophagitis ) , there was no evidence of carcinogenic potential for famotidine .
Famotidine was negative in the microbial mutagen test ( Ames test ) using Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli with or without rat liver enzyme activation at concentrations up to 10 , 000 mcg / plate .
In in vivo studies in mice , with a micronucleus test and a chromosomal aberration test , no evidence of a mutagenic effect was observed .
In studies with rats given oral doses of up to 2000 mg / kg / day ( approximately 243 times , based on body surface area , the recommended human dose of 80 mg per day ) fertility and reproductive performance were not affected .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Active Duodenal Ulcer In a U . S . multicenter , double - blind trial in adult outpatients with endoscopically confirmed duodenal ulcer ( DU ) , orally administered famotidine was compared to placebo .
As shown in Table 4 , 70 % of patients treated with famotidine 40 mg at bedtime were healed by Week 4 .
Most patients ’ DU healed within 4 weeks .
Patients not healed by Week 4 were continued in the trial .
By Week 8 , 83 % of patients treated with famotidine had healed DU , compared to 45 % of patients treated with placebo .
The incidence of DU healing with famotidine was greater than with placebo at each time point based on proportion of endoscopically confirmed healed DUs .
Trials have not assessed the safety of famotidine in uncomplicated active DU for periods of more than 8 weeks .
Table 4 : Patients with Endoscopically Confirmed Healed Duodenal Ulcers ap < 0 . 001 vs . placebo Famotidine 40 mg at bedtime ( N = 89 ) Famotidine 20 mg twice daily ( N = 84 ) Placebo at bedtime ( N = 97 ) Week 2 32 % a 38 % a 17 % Week 4 70 % a 67 % a 31 % In this study , time to relief of daytime and nocturnal pain was shorter for patients receiving famotidine than for patients receiving placebo ; patients receiving famotidine also took less antacid than patients receiving placebo .
14 . 2 Active Gastric Ulcer In both a U . S . and an international multicenter , double - blind trials in patients with endoscopically confirmed active gastric ulcer ( GU ) , orally administered famotidine 40 mg at bedtime was compared to placebo .
Antacids were permitted during the trials , but consumption was not significantly different between the famotidine and placebo groups .
As shown in Table 5 , the incidence of GU healing confirmed by endoscopy ( dropouts counted as unhealed ) with famotidine was greater than placebo at Weeks 6 and 8 in the U . S . trial , and at Weeks 4 , 6 and 8 in the international trial .
In these trials , most famotidine - treated patients healed within 6 weeks .
Trials have not assessed the safety of famotidine in uncomplicated active GU for periods of more than 8 weeks .

Study ( N = 149 ) International Study ( N = 294 ) Famotidine 40 mg at bedtime ( N = 74 ) Placebo at bedtime ( N = 75 ) Famotidine 40 mg at bedtime ( N = 149 ) Placebo at bedtime ( N = 145 ) Week 4 45 % 39 % 47 % a 31 % Week 6 66 % a 44 % 65 % a 46 % Week 8 78 % b 64 % 80 % a 54 % Time to complete relief of daytime and nighttime pain was statistically significantly shorter for patients receiving famotidine than for patients receiving placebo ; however , neither trial demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients whose pain was relieved by the end of the trial ( Week 8 ) .
14 . 3 Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease ( GERD ) Orally administered famotidine was compared to placebo in a U . S . trial that enrolled patients with symptoms of GERD and without endoscopic evidence of esophageal erosion or ulceration .
As shown in Table 6 , patients treated with famotidine 20 mg twice daily had greater improvement in symptomatic GERD than patients treated with 40 mg at bedtime or placebo .
Table 6 : Patients with Improvement of Symptomatic GERD ( N = 376 ) a p ≤ 0 . 01 vs . placebo Famotidine 20 mg twice daily ( N = 154 ) Famotidine 40 mg at bedtime ( N = 149 ) Placebo at bedtime ( N = 73 ) Week 6 82 % a 69 % 62 % 14 . 4 Erosive Esophagitis due to GERD Healing of endoscopically verified erosion and symptomatic improvement were studied in a U . S . and an international double - blind trials .
Healing was defined as complete resolution of all erosions visible with endoscopy .
The U . S . trial comparing orally administered famotidine 40 mg twice daily to placebo and orally administered famotidine 20 mg twice daily showed a significantly greater percentage of healing of erosive esophagitis for famotidine 40 mg twice daily at Weeks 6 and 12 ( Table 7 ) .

Study ( N = 318 ) a p ≤ 0 . 01 vs . placebo b p ≤ 0 . 01 vs . famotidine 20 mg twice daily c p ≤ 0 . 05 vs . famotidine 20 mg twice daily Famotidine 40 mg twice daily ( N = 127 ) Famotidine 20 mg twice daily ( N = 125 ) Placebo twice daily ( N = 66 ) Week 6 48 % a , b 32 % 18 % Week 12 69 % a , c 54 % a 29 % As compared to placebo , patients in the U . S . trial who received famotidine had faster relief of daytime and nighttime heartburn , and a greater percentage of famotidine - treated patients experienced complete relief of nighttime heartburn .
These differences were statistically significant .
In the international trial , when orally administered famotidine 40 mg twice daily was compared to orally administered ranitidine 150 mg twice daily , a statistically significantly greater percentage of healing of erosive esophagitis was observed with famotidine 40 mg twice daily at Week 12 ( Table 8 ) .
There was , however , no significant difference in symptom relief among treatment groups .

Orally administered famotidine dosages from 20 mg to 160 mg every 6 hours maintained basal acid secretion below 10 mEq / hour ; initial dosages were titrated to the individual patient need and subsequent adjustments were necessary with time in some patients .
14 . 6 Risk Reduction of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence Two randomized , double - blind , multicenter trials in patients with endoscopically confirmed healed DUs demonstrated that patients receiving treatment with orally administered famotidine 20 mg at bedtime had lower rates of DU recurrence , as compared with placebo .
• In the U . S . trial , DU recurrence within 12 months was 2 . 4 times greater in patients treated with placebo than in the patients treated with famotidine .
The 89 famotidine - treated patients had a cumulative observed DU recurrence rate of 23 % , compared to a 57 % in the 89 patients receiving placebo ( p < 0 . 01 ) .
• In the international trial , the cumulative observed DU recurrence within 12 months in the 307 famotidine - treated patients was 36 % , compared to 76 % in the 325 patients who received placebo ( p < 0 . 01 ) .
Controlled trials have not extended beyond one year .
