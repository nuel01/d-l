SECTION 3 .
SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION Since the initial identification of H . pylori in the early 1980 s [ 1 ] , the management of upper gastrointestinal disease has changed dramatically .
“ Helicobacter pylori is now recognized as an important pathogen and a causal relationship between H . pylori and chronic active gastritis , duodenal ulcer , and gastric ulcer is well documented ” [ 2 ] .
Currently there are numerous H . pylori detection technologies for upper gastrointestinal disease including biopsy and serum analysis .
These technologies depend on two general approaches for obtaining a sample for testing : invasive and non - invasive .
The first invasive test method requires an endoscopic gastric biopsy .
The tissue collected from the biopsy is then examined in a laboratory by microbiological culture of the organism , direct detection of urease activity in the tissue , or by histological examination of stained tissue .
Biopsy - based methods present an element of patient risk and discomfort and may provide false negative results due to sampling errors .
The second invasive test is a serological test ; this requires a blood sample which is used to detect serum antibodies to H . pylori .
The disadvantage of this test is that it is difficult to distinguish between positive active infections and past exposure to infection , and therefore it is not a conclusive indicator of current H . pylori infection .
13 C - urea breath tests provide a non - invasive and non - hazardous analysis of the exhaled breath .
The BreathID ® test ( described in the next section ) measures the 12CO2 and 13CO2 components of the exhaled breath before and after the oral ingestion of 13 C - enriched urea .
This establishes the baseline ratio of 13CO2 / 12CO2 and the post ingestion ratio of 13CO2 / 12CO2 in order to determine the Delta Over Baseline [ 1 ] ( change in the 13CO2 / 12CO2 ratio ) .
SECTION 4 .
PRINCIPLES OF THE EXALENZ BREATHID ® BREATH TEST The Exalenz BreathID ® non - invasive breath test is a diagnostic test that analyzes a breath sample before and after ingestion of 13 C - enriched urea ; it is used to identify those patients with H . pylori infection .
The Exalenz BreathID ® breath test is performed as follows : a 75 mg 13 C - urea tablet and 4 . 3 g Citrica Powder are dissolved in water , and the resulting solution is ingested by the patient .
The presence of the Citrica creates an acidic environment in the stomach and also delays the transfer of the ingested solution to the duodenum .
These two characteristics facilitate the decomposition of the urea by H . pylori , if present .
Thus , in the presence of urease associated with gastric H . pylori , 13 C - urea is decomposed to 13CO2 and NH3 according to the following equation : H . pylori urease 2 13 C - urea + 2 H2 O → 2 13CO2 + 2 NH3 The 13CO2 is absorbed into the blood and then exhaled in the breath .
Absorption and distribution of 13CO2 is fast .
Therefore , the cleavage of urea by the H . pylori urease that produces the 13CO2 occurs immediately after the solution is ingested and enables immediate detection of increased 13CO2 in the exhaled breath of H . pylori - positive patients .
In the case of H . pylori - negative patients , the 13 C - urea does not produce 13CO2 in the stomach because there are no human enzymes that can decompose the urea in the stomach .
4 . 1 .
Description of the mode of operation of the BreathID ® device The test consists of two phases , the Sampling phase , at which time two Breath Sample Bags are inflated by the patient , and the Analysis phase as which time the two Breath Sample Bags are analyzed together using the BreathID ® Hp Lab System .
Sampling phase begins with the collection of a baseline breath sample .
The patient inflates the Baseline Breath Sample Bag .
The patient then ingests a test drink consisting of 13 C - urea tablet 75 mg and 4 . 3 g of Citrica Powder ( 4 g citric acid ) .
After 15 - 20 minutes a post - ingestion sample is collected by inflation of the Post Ingestion Breath Sample Bag .
The analysis is performed with the BreathID ® Hp Lab System up to 14 days from sample collection , either locally or remotely .
The 13CO2 / 12CO2 ratio is measured and the DOB computed .
SECTION 5 .
REAGENT 5 . 1 .
DESCRIPTION OF THE 13 C - UREA DIAGNOSTIC COMPONENT The diagnostic drug component of the kit is 13 C - enriched urea prepared as a tablet .
The tablet should be dissolved with Citrica Powder in a glass of water , providing a clear , colorless solution for oral administration .
The 75 mg 13 C - urea component is supplied as a tablet in a sealed pouch .
The 4 . 3 g of Citrica Powder ( 4 g citric acid , [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] , aspartame , and Tutti Frutti flavoring ) is supplied in a separate sealed pouch .
An average adult body normally contains about 9 . 0 grams of urea , which is a product of protein metabolism .
Urea in the body is referred to as a natural isotopic abundance urea since it is composed of 98 . 9 % 12 C - urea and 1 . 1 % 13 C - urea .
Greater than or equal to 99 % of the carbon molecules in the supplied tablet are in the form of 13 C ; a stable , naturally occurring , non - radioactive isotope of carbon .
13 C - urea is the diamide of 13 C carbonic acid and is highly soluble in water ( 1 gram per ml at 25 ° C ) .
It has the following chemical formula : 13CH4N2O .
5 . 2 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 1 .

The 13 C - urea tablet and Citrica Powder are dissolved in a glass of water and the resulting solution is taken orally as part of the diagnostic procedure .
2 .
Phenylketonurics : Contains Phenylalanine , 84 mg per dosage unit of Citrica Powder .
3 .
In the case of accidental overdose – drink water and call the physician .
4 .
A negative result does not rule out the possibility of H . pylori infection .
False negative results can occur with this procedure .
If clinical signs suggest H . pylori infection , retest with a new sample or an alternate method .
5 .
A false positive test may occur due to urease associated with other gastric spiral organisms observed in humans such as Helicobacter heilmanni .
6 .
A false positive test could occur in patients who have achlorhydria .
7 .
Antimicrobials , proton pump inhibitors , and bismuth preparations are known to suppress H . pylori .
Ingesting these medications within two weeks prior to performing the breath test may produce false negative test results .
8 .

SECTION 10 .
TEST RESULTS 10 . 1 .
THE TEST METHOD The ratio of 13CO2 to 12CO2 in breath samples is determined by Molecular Correlation Spectrometry ( MCS ™ ) , which is utilized by the BreathID ® Hp Lab device software .
10 . 2 .
CALCULATION OF RESULTS The results are provided as Delta Over Baseline .
Delta Over Baseline is the difference between the Delta values ( based on a ratio of 13CO2 / 12CO2 ) in the POST INGESTION Breath Sample Bag specimen and the corresponding BASELINE Breath Sample Bag specimen .
There are no calculations required by the user .
10 . 3 .
DETERMINATION OF THE CUTOFF POINT The cutoff point is the level ( threshold ) used to discriminate between H . pylori - infected and uninfected individuals .
The Delta Over Baseline cutoff point was determined to be five in a controlled study of 186 adult asymptomatic and symptomatic patients ( 101 infected and 85 uninfected ) .
The study was conducted in Israel using a local reference standard called the Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer ( IRMS ) .
The cutoff point was evaluated by determining the original BreathID ® test result ( DOB ) threshold at which positive and negative patients , as determined by the Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer , were best distinguished .
Figure 1 shows the BreathID ® test cutoff point graphically , which distinguishes H . pylori - positive and negative patients Figure 1 : Cutoff for BreathID ® Test as Determined in an Initial Clinical Study The cutoff point was confirmed in a controlled pivotal clinical study where 300 subjects were enrolled .
The study consisted of a pre - therapy and post - therapy phase .
Patients enrolled in the pre - therapy phase had dyspeptic symptoms , active peptic ulcer disease , or a past history of peptic ulcer disease .
To be eligible for the post - therapy phase , H . pylori - positive patients had to be treated for infection four weeks prior to enrollment ( some patients participated in both the pre - therapy and post - therapy phases ) .
In the pre - therapy phase , 47 patients were found to be infected and 253 were found to be uninfected .
Congruent results obtained by rapid urease test and histological examination of biopsy tissue were used as the reference standard .
In the post - therapy phase , 22 patients were infected and 50 were uninfected .
The reference standard was a positive finding by endoscopic test ( rapid urease or histology ) or urea breath test ( UBT ) .
For more details , refer to section13 .
Figure 2 below shows the BreathID ® Delta Over Baseline results .
Figure 2 : Cutoff Point for BreathID ® Test as Determined for Pre - Therapy Patients in the Pivotal Clinical Study 10 . 4 .
INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS A BreathID ® test result of greater than 5 Delta Over Baseline is interpreted as diagnostically positive , indicating the presence of urease associated with H . pylori .
A BreathID ® test result of less than or equal to 5 Delta Over Baseline is interpreted as diagnostically negative , indicating the absence of urease associated with H . pylori .
The 5 Delta Over Baseline cutoff point applies to both initial diagnosis and post treatment monitoring of H . pylori infection .
For more details , refer to section 13 .
SECTION 11 .
LIMITATIONS OF THE TEST Post treatment monitoring of H . pylori should be performed after at least four weeks of treatment for H . pylori infection .
Earlier assessment may give false results .
Safety and effectiveness in patients under the age of 18 years have not yet been established .
Data is insufficient for recommending the use of this test on patients with total or partial gastrectomy .
Data is insufficient to recommend the use of this test on pregnant and lactating women .
A correlation between the number of H . pylori organisms in the stomach and the BreathID ® test results has not been established .
SECTION 12 .
EXPECTED VALUES Delta Over Baseline values for the BreathID ® test were determined in a controlled clinical study of 186 adult asymptomatic and symptomatic patients ( 101 infected and 85 uninfected ) in Israel , using a known reference standard called the Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer ( IRMS ) and performed in a local Israeli laboratory .
The range of Delta Over Baseline values for the uninfected patients was determined to be between ‑ 1 and 8 .
A histogram of the distribution of Delta Over Baseline values from uninfected patients is shown in Figure 3 below . Figure 3 : Distribution of Data for Uninfected Patients as Determined in an Initial Clinical StudyDelta Over Baseline values , as determined by the BreathID ® in a pivotal clinical study , were used to confirm the initial clinical data . In the pre - therapy phase , there were 47 infected and 253 uninfected patients .
Congruent results obtained by rapid urease test and histological examinations of biopsy tissue were used as the reference standard and were confirmed by the BreathID ® in the 47 infected patients .
In the post therapy phase , 22 patients were infected and 50 were uninfected .
The reference standard in this phase was at least one positive finding from either an endoscopic test ( rapid urease or histology ) or by a UBT . The following values were obtained for the data from the pivotal study : Upper 97 . 5 % percentile of the Negative patients : 2 . 245 Lower 2 . 5 % percentile of the Positive patients : 7 . 212 A histogram of the distribution of Delta Over Baseline values from pre - therapy uninfected ( first phase ) patients is shown in Figure 4 below .

CONFIRMATORY STUDY OF IDKIT HP ™ TWO IN THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION Experimental Design A multi - center , non - randomized , open label study was conducted with the primary goal of confirming the safety of the 13 C - urea substrate in pediatric subjects , and a secondary goal of evaluating performance of the BreathID ® Hp Lab System with IDkit Hp ™ Two breath sample bags in pediatric subjects aged 3 - 17 years using the same 5 DOB diagnostic cut - off , in this population compared to stool antigen testing .
A central lab analyzed the stool specimens . The study was conducted at 6 clinical sites where the sites were geographically diverse , differing in size and diverse in experience representing both point of care testing as well as sites utilizing a clinical laboratory .
Local site personnel were trained on administering the breath test .
To represent point of care and clinical laboratory settings , the sample analysis was performed either on site or at a central laboratory using a BreathID ® Hp Lab System . ResultsA total number of 54 subjects were screened , 1 subject was a screening failure prior to any study related procedure .
Fifty - three subjects were enrolled and followed for safety assessment , 42 of which completed the full study protocol requirements with evaluable endpoints .
There were no reportable major safety concerns due to adverse events . Table 7 presents the diagnosis as assessed by the BreathID ® Hp Lab System using IDkit Hp ™ Two breath sample bags compared to the assessment by an FDA cleared H . pylori stool antigen test .

STABILITY OF BREATH SAMPLES OVER TIME 193 initial diagnosis patients were asked to perform the urea breath test using two sets of IDkit Hp ™ Two .
The sample analysis was performed either on site or in a remote location using a BreathID ® Hp Lab System .
Each pair of breath sample bags was analyzed at a different time point up to 14 days apart in order to assess the stability of the breath samples in the bags .
There were 191 subjects with two evaluable results for analysis .
Out of 45 samples positive on the first measurement , 44 remained positive on the second measurement ( Percent Positive Agreement : 97 . 8 % [ 95 % CI ( 88 . 43 , 99 . 61 ) ] ) .
Out of 146 samples negative on the first measurement , all 146 remained negative on the second measurement ( Percent Negative Agreement : 100 % [ 95 % CI ( 97 . 44 , 100 ) ] ) .

REPRODUCIBILITY ANALYTICAL STUDY Three different accurate gas isotope pairs were used with Delta Over Baseline ( DOB ) values of 3 . 3 , 6 . 4 , and 15 . 5 in a bench study .
Two operators were asked to operate each of three BreathID ® Hp Lab System at three different sites for five days , in order to measure the DOB values for samples from each of the three batches .
The results demonstrated that the standard deviation and overall reproducibility were stable over different batches for both the operator , the devices and between days .
The reproducibility standard deviation was 0 . 65 or less for all batches , and the between days , devices and operators standard deviation was 0 . 66 or less in all cases , which is less than the natural variability of the DOB measurement .

PRECISION ANALYTICAL STUDY ( REPEATABILITY ) Three different accurate gas isotope pairs were used with Delta Over Baseline ( DOB ) values of 3 . 3 , 6 . 4 , and 15 . 5 in a bench study .
The DOB values for samples from each of the three batches were measured on the BreathID ® Hp Lab System twice a day for 12 days .
The results demonstrated that the standard deviation and overall repeatability were stable over different batches and different days .
The repeatability standard deviation was 0 . 64 or less and the overall between days standard deviation was 0 . 72 or less , which is less than the natural variability of the DOB measurement .
