CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Combination oral contraceptives prevent pregnancy primarily by suppressing ovulation .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Altavera is indicated for use by females of reproductive potential to prevent pregnancy .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Altavera is contraindicated in females who are known to have the following conditions : • A high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic diseases .
Examples include women who are known to : • Smoke , if over age 35 [ see BOXED WARNING and WARNINGS ( 1 ) ] .
• Have current or history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism [ see WARNINGS ( 1 ) ] .
• Have cerebrovascular disease [ see WARNINGS ( 1 ) ] .
• Have coronary artery disease [ see WARNINGS ( 1 ) ] .
• Have thrombogenic valvular or thrombogenic rhythm diseases of the heart ( for example , subacute bacterial endocarditis with valvular disease , or atrial fibrillation ) [ see WARNINGS ( 1 ) ] .
• Have inherited or acquired hypercoagulopathies [ see WARNINGS ( 1 ) ] .
• Have uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [ see WARNINGS ( 3 ) ] .
• Have diabetes mellitus and are over age 35 , diabetes mellitus with hypertension or vascular disease or other end - organ damage , or diabetes mellitus of > 20 years duration [ see WARNINGS ( 7 ) ] .
• Have headaches with focal neurological symptoms , migraine headaches with aura , or over age 35 with any migraine headaches [ see WARNINGS ( 8 ) ] .
• Current diagnosis of , or history of , breast cancer , which may be hormone - sensitive .
[ see WARNINGS ( 3 ) ] .
• Liver tumors , acute viral hepatitis , or severe ( decompensated ) cirrhosis [ see WARNINGS ( 2 ) ] .
• Use of Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir , due to the potential for ALT elevations [ see WARNINGS ( 5 ) ] .
• Undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding [ see WARNINGS ( 9 ) ] .
WARNINGS 1 .
Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Conditions • Stop Altavera if an arterial or venous thrombotic / thromboembolic event occurs .
• Stop Altavera if there is unexplained loss of vision , proptosis , diplopia , papilledema , or retinal vascular lesions and evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately .
• Discontinue Altavera during prolonged immobilization .
If feasible , stop Altavera at least four weeks before and through two weeks after major surgery , or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of thromboembolism .
• Start Altavera no earlier than four weeks after delivery in females who are not breast - feeding .
The risk of postpartum thromboembolism decreases after the third postpartum week , whereas the likelihood of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week .
• Before starting Altavera evaluate any past medical history or family history of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders and consider whether the history suggests an inherited or acquired hypercoagulopathy .
Altavera is contraindicated in females with a high risk of arterial or venous thrombotic / thromboembolic diseases ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Arterial Events COCs increase the risk of cardiovascular events and cerebrovascular events , such as myocardial infarction and stroke .
The risk is greater among older women ( > 35 years of age ) , smokers , and females with hypertension , dyslipidemia , diabetes , or obesity .
Altavera is contraindicated in women over 35 years of age who smoke ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use .
This risk increases with age , particularly in women over 35 years of age , and with the number of cigarettes smoked .
Venous Events Use of COCs increases the risk of venous thromboembolic events ( VTEs ) , such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism .
Risk factors for VTEs include smoking , obesity , and family history of VTE , in addition to other factors that contraindicate use of COCs ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
While the increased risk of VTE associated with use of COCs is well - established , the rates of VTE are even greater during pregnancy , and especially during the postpartum period ( see Figure 1 ) .
The rate of VTE in females using COCs has been estimated to be 3 to 9 cases per 10 , 000 woman - years .
The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of a COC and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of four weeks or longer .
Based on results from a few studies , there is some evidence that this is true for non - oral products as well .
The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after COC use is discontinued .
Figure 1 shows the risk of developing a VTE for females who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives , for females who use oral contraceptives , for pregnant females , and for females in the postpartum period .
To put the risk of developing a VTE into perspective : If 10 , 000 females who are not pregnant and do not use oral contraceptives are followed for one year , between 1 and 5 of these females will develop a VTE .
Figure 1 .
Likelihood of Developing a VTE [ MULTIMEDIA ] 2 .
Liver Disease Elevated Liver Enzymes Altavera is contraindicated in females with acute viral hepatitis or severe ( decompensated ) cirrhosis of liver ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Discontinue Altavera if jaundice develops .
Acute liver test abnormalities may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until the liver tests return to normal and COC causation has been excluded .
Liver Tumors Altavera is contraindicated in females with benign or malignant liver tumors ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
COCs increase the risk of hepatic adenomas .
An estimate of the attributable risk is 3 . 3 cases / 100 , 000 COC users .
Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death from abdominal hemorrhage .
Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long - term ( > 8 years ) COC users .
The attributable risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users .
3 .
Malignant Neoplasms Breast Cancer Altavera is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ] .
Epidemiology studies have not found a consistent association between use of combined oral contraceptives ( COCs ) and breast cancer risk .
Studies do not show an association between ever ( current or past ) use of COCs and risk of breast cancer .
However , some studies report a small increase in the risk of breast cancer among current or recent users ( < 6 months since last use ) and current users with longer duration of COC use [ see POSTMARKETING EXPERIENCE ] .
Cervical Cancer Some studies suggest that COCs are associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia .
There is controversy about the extent to which these findings are due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors .
4 .
Hypertension Altavera is contraindicated in females with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
For all females , including those with well - controlled hypertension , monitor blood pressure at routine visits and stop Altavera if blood pressure rises significantly .
An increase in blood pressure has been reported in females using COCs , and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use .
The effect of COCs on blood pressure may vary according to the progestin in the COC .
5 .
Age - related Considerations The risk for cardiovascular disease and prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease increase with age .
Certain conditions , such as smoking and migraine headache without aura , that do not contraindicate COC use in younger females , are contraindications to use in women over 35 years of age [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS ( 1 ) ] .
Consider the presence of underlying risk factors that may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or VTE , particularly before initiating a COC for women over 35 years , such as : • Hypertension • Diabetes • Dyslipidemia • Obesity 6 .
Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir , ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) , including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN , were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol - containing medications such as COCs .
Discontinue Altavera prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Altavera can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the combination drug regimen .
7 .
Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest an increased risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users .
Use of COCs may also worsen existing gallbladder disease .
A past history of COC - related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use .
Females with a history of pregnancy - related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC - related cholestasis .
8 .
Adverse Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Hyperglycemia Altavera is contraindicated in diabetic women over age 35 , or females who have diabetes with hypertension , nephropathy , retinopathy , neuropathy , other vascular disease , or females with diabetes of > 20 years duration ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Altavera may decrease glucose tolerance .
Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic females who are using Altavera .
Dyslipidemia Consider alternative contraception for females with uncontrolled dyslipidemia .
Altavera may cause adverse lipid changes .
Females with hypertriglyceridemia , or a family history thereof , may have an increase in serum triglyceride concentrations when using Altavera , which may increase the risk of pancreatitis .
9 .
Headache Altavera is contraindicated in females who have headaches with focal neurological symptoms or have migraine headaches with aura , and in women over age 35 years who have migraine headaches with or without aura ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
If a woman using Altavera develops new headaches that are recurrent , persistent , or severe , evaluate the cause and discontinue Altavera if indicated .
Consider discontinuation of Altavera if there is an increased frequency or severity of migraines during COC use ( which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event ) .
10 .
Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Females using Altavera may experience unscheduled ( breakthrough or intracyclic ) bleeding and spotting , especially during the first three months of use .
Bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or by changing to a different contraceptive product .
If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles , evaluate for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy .
In two clinical trials of Altavera ( 1084 subjects reporting for a total of 8186 treatment cycles and 238 subjects reporting for a total of 1102 treatment cycles ) , breakthrough bleeding occurred in 6 . 9 % and 8 . 1 % of reported cycles , and spotting occurred in 8 . 6 % and 7 . 9 % of reported cycles over the total study duration , respectively .
In the two trials , intermenstrual bleeding ( i . e . , breakthrough bleeding and / or spotting ) occurred in 13 . 1 % and 12 . 9 % of reported cycles over the total study duration , respectively .
In one trial , 33 subjects out of 1084 ( 3 . 0 % ) discontinued due to bleeding irregularities ( i . e . , breakthrough bleeding and spotting ) ; in the other trial , 6 subjects out of 238 ( 2 . 5 % ) discontinued due to bleeding irregularities .
Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Females who use Altavera may experience absence of scheduled ( withdrawal ) bleeding , even if they are not pregnant .
In two clinical trials of Altavera , one including 8186 reported treatment cycles , and the other including 1102 reported treatment cycles , amenorrhea occurred in 1 . 5 % of treatment cycles in each trial .
If scheduled bleeding does not occur , consider the possibility of pregnancy .
If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule ( missed one or two active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have ) , consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and perform appropriate diagnostic measures .
If the patient has adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule and misses two consecutive periods , rule out pregnancy .
After discontinuation of a COC , amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea may occur , especially if these conditions were pre - existent .
11 .
Depression Carefully observe females with a history of depression and discontinue Altavera if depression recurs to a serious degree .
Data on the association of COCs with onset of depression or exacerbation of existing depression are limited .
12 .
Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of Altavera may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine - binding globulin , sex hormone - binding globulin , and cortisol - binding globulin .
The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased .
13 .
Hereditary Angioedema In females with hereditary angioedema , exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema .
14 .
Chloasma Chloasma may occur with Altavera use , especially in females with a history of chloasma gravidarum .
Advise females with a history of chloasma to avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while using Altavera .
PRECAUTIONS 1 .
Lipid Disorders Women who are being treated for hyperlipidemias should be followed closely if they elect to use oral contraceptives .
Some progestogens may elevate LDL levels and may render the control of hyperlipidemias more difficult [ see WARNINGS ( 7 ) ] .
In patients with familial defects of lipoprotein metabolism receiving estrogen - containing preparations , there have been case reports of significant elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis .
2 .
Fluid Retention Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention .
They should be prescribed with caution , and only with careful monitoring , in patients with conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention .
3 .
Gastrointestinal Motility Diarrhea and / or vomiting may reduce hormone absorption ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
4 .
Drug Interactions The sections below provide information on substances for which data on drug interactions with COCs are available .
There is little information available about the clinical effect of most drug interactions that may affect COCs .
However , based on the known pharmacokinetic effects of these drugs , clinical strategies to minimize any potential adverse effect on contraceptive effectiveness or safety are suggested .
Consult the approved product labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with COCs or the potential for metabolic enzyme or transporter system alterations .
No drug - drug interaction studies were conducted with Altavera .
4 . 1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances Decreasing the Plasma Concentrations of COCs and Potentially Diminishing the Efficacy of COCs : Table 1 includes substances that demonstrated an important drug interaction with Altavera .
Table 1 : Significant Drug Interactions Involving Substances That Affect COCs Metabolic Enzyme Inducers Clinical effect • Concomitant use of COCs with metabolic enzyme inducers may decrease the plasma concentrations of the estrogen and / or progestin component of COCs .
• Decreased exposure of the estrogen and / or progestin component of COCs may potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs and may lead to contraceptive failure or an increase in breakthrough bleeding .
Prevention or management • Counsel females to use an alternative method of contraception or a backup method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs .
• Continue backup contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to maintain contraceptive reliability .
Examples Aprepitant , barbiturates , bosentan , carbamazepine , efavirenz , felbamate , griseofulvin , oxcarbazepine , phenytoin , rifampin , rifabutin , rufinamide , topiramate , products containing St . John ’ s worta , and certain protease inhibitors ( see separate section on protease inhibitors below ) .
Colesevelam Clinical effect • Concomitant use of COCs with colesevelam significantly decreases systemic exposure of ethinylestradiol .
• Decreased exposure of the estrogen component of COCs may potentially reduce contraceptive efficacy or result in an increase in breakthrough bleeding , depending on the strength of ethinyl estradiol in the COC .
Prevention or management Administer 4 or more hours apart to attenuate this drug interaction .
aInduction potency of St . John ’ s wort may vary widely based on preparation .
Substances increasing the systemic exposure of COCs : Co - administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and COCs containing ethinyl estradiol increase systemic exposure of ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20 to 25 percent .
Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase systemic exposure of ethinyl estradiol , possibly by inhibition of conjugation .
CYP3A inhibitors such as itraconazole , voriconazole , fluconazole , grapefruit juice , or ketoconazole may increase systemic exposure of the estrogen and / or progestin component of COCs .
Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) / hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) protease inhibitors and non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors : Significant decreases in systemic exposure of the estrogen and / or progestin have been noted when COCs are co - administered with some HIV protease inhibitors ( e . g . , nelfinavir , ritonavir , darunavir / ritonavir , ( fos ) amprenavir / ritonavir , lopinavir / ritonavir , and tipranavir / ritonavir ) , some HCV protease inhibitors ( e . g . , boceprevir and telaprevir ) , and some non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( e . g . , nevirapine ) .
In contrast , significant increases in systemic exposure of the estrogen and / or progestin have been noted when COCs are co - administered with certain other HIV protease inhibitors ( e . g . , indinavir and atazanavir / ritonavir ) and with other non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( e . g . , etravirine ) .
4 . 2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs Table 2 provides significant drug interaction information for drugs co - administered with Altavera .
Table 2 : Significant Drug Interaction Information for Drugs Co - Administered With COCs Lamotrigine Clinical effect • Concomitant use of COCs with lamotrigine may significantly decrease systemic exposure of lamotrigine due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation .
• Decreased systemic exposure of lamotrigine may reduce seizure control .
Prevention or management Dose adjustment may be necessary .
Consult the approved product labeling for lamotrigine .
Thyroid Hormone Replacement Therapy or Corticosteroid Replacement Therapy Clinical effect Concomitant use of COCs with thyroid hormone replacement therapy or corticosteroid replacement therapy may increase systemic exposure of thyroid - binding and cortisol - binding globulin ( see Warnings , EFFECT ON BINDING GLOBULINS ) .
Prevention or management The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased .
Consult the approved product labeling for the therapy in use ( see Warnings , EFFECT ON BINDING GLOBULINS ) .
Other Drugs Clinical effect Concomitant use of COCs may decrease systemic exposure of acetaminophen , morphine , salicylic acid , and temazepam .
Concomitant use with ethinyl estradiol containing COCs may increase systemic exposure of other drugs ( e . g . , cyclosporine , prednisolone , theophylline , tizanidine , and voriconazole ) .
Prevention or management The dosage of drugs that can be affected by this interaction may need to be increased .
Consult the approved product labeling for the concomitantly used drug .
4 . 3 Concomitant Use with Hepatitis C Virus ( HCV ) Combination Therapy – Liver Enzyme Elevation Do not co - administer Altavera with HCV drug Combinations containing ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir , [ see Warnings ( 5 ) ] , and glecaprevir / pibrentasvir due to potential for ALT elavations .
4 . 4 Effect on Laboratory Tests The use of COCs may influence the results of certain laboratory tests , such as coagulation factors , lipids , glucose tolerace , and binding proteins .
5 .
Carcinogenesis See WARNINGS ( 11 ) .
6 .
Pregnancy Risk Summary Discontinue Altavera if pregnancy occurs because there is no reason to use COCs in pregnancy .
Discontinue Altavera if pregnancy occurs .
Epidemiologic studies and meta - analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or nongenital birth defects ( including cardiac anomalies and limb - reduction defects ) following exposure to COCs before conception or during early pregnancy .
Animal studies to evaluate embryo / fetal toxicity were not conducted .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 percent and 15 to 20 percent , respectively .
7 .
Lactation Risk Summary Contraceptive hormones and / or metabolites are present in human milk .
COCs can reduce milk production in breast - feeding females .
This reduction can occur at any time but is less likely to occur once breast - feeding is well - established .
When possible , advise the nursing female to use other methods of contraception until she discontinues breast - feeding .
( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
The developmental and health benefits of breast - feeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for Altavera and any potential adverse effects on the breast - fed child from Altavera or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 .
Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of Altavera have been established in females of reproductive potential .
Use of Altavera before menarche is not indicated .
9 .
Geriatric Use Altavera has not been studied in postmenopausal women and is not indicated in this population .
10 .
PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION • Counsel patients that cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from COC use , and that women who are over 35 years old and smoke should not use COCs ( see BOXED WARNING and CONTRADICATIONS ) .
• Counsel patients that this product does not protect against HIV - infection ( AIDS ) and other sexually transmitted infections .
• Counsel patients to take one tablet daily by mouth at the same time every day .
Instruct patients what to do in the event pills are missed ( see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION ) .
• Counsel patients to use a back - up or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs ( see PRECAUTIONS ( 4 . 1 ) ] .
• Counsel patients who are breastfeeding or who desire to breastfeed that COCs may reduce breast milk production .
This is less likely to occur if breastfeeding is well established COCs ( see PRECAUTIONS ( 7 ) ] .
• Counsel any patient who starts Altavera postpartum , and who has not yet had a period , to use an additional method of contraception until she has taken a light - orange tablet for 7 consecutive days ( see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION ) .
• Counsel patients that amenorrhea may occur .
Pregnancy should be considered in the event of amenorrhea , and should be ruled out if amenorrhea is associated with symptoms of pregnancy , such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness [ see WARNINGS ( 9 ) ] .
• Depression may occur .
Women should contact their healthcare provider if depression occurs , including shortly after initiating the treatment [ see WARNINGS ( 10 ) ] .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Post Marketing Experience Five studies that compared breast cancer risk between ever - users ( current or past use ) of COCs and never - users of COCs reported no association between ever use of COCs and breast cancer risk , with effect estimates ranging from 0 . 90 - 1 . 12 ( Figure 2 ) .
Three studies compared breast cancer risk between current or recent COC users ( < 6 months since last use ) and never users of COCs ( Figure 2 ) .
One of these studies reported no association between breast cancer risk and COC use .
The other two studies found an increased relative risk of 1 . 19 - 1 . 33 with current or recent use .
Both of these studies found an increased risk of breast cancer with current use of longer duration , with relative risks ranging from 1 . 03 with less than one year of COC use to approximately 1 . 4 with more than 8 - 10 years of COC use .
Figure 2 : Risk of Breast Cancer with Combined Oral Contraceptive Use [ MULTIMEDIA ] RR = relative risk ; OR = odds ratio ; HR = hazard ratio .
“ ever COC ” are females with current or past COC use ; “ never COC use ” are females that never used COCs .

Manufactured by Laboratorios Leon Farma S . A . , Spain for Xiromed , LLC . , Florham Park , NJ 07932 PI - 116 - 05 Rev . 09 / 2022 Patient Information ALTAVERA ® [ all - tuh - VAIR - uh ] ( levonorgestrel 0 . 15 mg and ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg tablets ) What is the most important information I should know about Altavera ?
Do not use Altavera if you smoke cigarettes and are over 35 years old .
Smoking increases your risk of serious cardiovascular side effects from hormonal birth control pills , including death from heart attack , blood clots or stroke .
This risk increases with age and the number of cigarettes you smoke .
What is Altavera ?
Altavera is a birth control pill ( oral contraceptive ) used by women to prevent pregnancy .
How does Altavera work for contraception ?
Your chance of getting pregnant depends on how well you follow the directions for taking your birth control pills .
