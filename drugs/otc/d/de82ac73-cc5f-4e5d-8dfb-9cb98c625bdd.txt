Administration through a peripheral intravenous catheter may cause burns .
AMMONUL may not be administered by any other route .
AMMONUL should be administered as a loading dose infusion over 90 to 120 minutes , followed by the same dose repeated as a maintenance infusion administered over 24 hours .
Because of prolonged plasma levels achieved by phenylacetate in pharmacokinetic studies , repeat loading doses of AMMONUL should not be administered .
Maintenance infusions may be continued until elevated plasma ammonia levels have been normalized or the patient can tolerate oral nutrition and medications .
An antiemetic may be administered during AMMONUL infusion to aid control of infusion - associated nausea and vomiting .
Administration of analogous oral drugs , such as sodium phenylbutyrate , should be terminated prior to AMMONUL infusion .
AMMONUL infusion should be started as soon as the diagnosis of hyperammonemia is made .
Treatment of hyperammonemia also requires caloric supplementation and restriction of dietary protein .
Non - protein calories should be supplied principally as glucose ( 8 – 10 mg / kg / min ) with an intravenous fat emulsion added .
Attempts should be made to maintain a caloric intake of greater than 80 kcal / kg / day .
During and after infusion of AMMONUL , ongoing monitoring of the following clinical laboratory values is crucial : plasma ammonia , glutamine , quantitative plasma amino acids , blood glucose , electrolytes , venous or arterial blood gases , AST and ALT .
On - going monitoring of the following clinical responses is also crucial to assess patient response to treatment : neurological status , Glasgow Coma Scale , tachypnea , CT or MRI scan or fundoscopic evidence of cerebral edema , and / or of gray matter and white matter damage .
Hemodialysis should be considered in patients with severe hyperammonemia or who are not responsive to AMMONUL administration [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ] .
In the non - neonatal study patient population treated with AMMONUL , dialysis was required in 13 % of hyperammonemic episodes .
Standard hemodialysis was the most frequently used dialysis method .
High levels of ammonia can be reduced quickly when AMMONUL is used with hemodialysis , as the ammonia - scavenging of AMMONUL suppresses the production of ammonia from catabolism of endogenous protein and hemodialysis eliminates the ammonia and ammonia conjugates .
AMMONUL solutions are physically and chemically stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature and room lighting conditions .
No compatibility information is presently available for AMMONUL infusion solutions except for Arginine HCl Injection , 10 % , which may be mixed in the same container as AMMONUL .
Other infusion solutions and drug products should not be administered together with AMMONUL infusion solution .
AMMONUL solutions may be prepared in glass and PVC containers .
Arginine Administration Intravenous arginine is an essential component of therapy for patients with carbamyl phosphate synthetase ( CPS ) , ornithine transcarbamylase ( OTC ) , argininosuccinate synthetase ( ASS ) , or argininosuccinate lyase ( ASL ) deficiency .
Because hyperchloremic acidosis may develop after high - dose arginine hydrochloride administration , chloride and bicarbonate levels should be monitored and appropriate amounts of bicarbonate administered .
In hyperammonemic infants with suspected , but unconfirmed urea cycle disorders , intravenous arginine should be given ( 6 mL / kg of Arginine HCl Injection 10 % , over 90 minutes followed by the same dose given as a maintenance infusion over 24 hours ) .
If deficiencies of ASS or ASL are excluded as diagnostic possibilities , the intravenous dose of Arginine HCl should be reduced to 2 mL / kg / day Arginine HCl Injection 10 % .
Converting to Oral Treatment Once elevated ammonia levels have been reduced to the normal range , oral therapy , such as sodium phenylbutyrate , dietary management and maintenance protein restrictions should be started or reinitiated .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS AMMONUL ( sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate ) Injection 10 % per 10 % is a sterile , concentrated , aqueous solution of sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate .
Injection : 10 % per 10 % sterile , concentrated , aqueous solution of sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate .
( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None .
None ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Decreased Potassium Levels : Plasma potassium levels should be carefully monitored and appropriate treatment given when necessary .
( 5 . 1 ) • • Conditions Associated with Fluid Overload : AMMONUL contains 30 . 5 mg of sodium per mL of undiluted product .
Caution should be used if AMMONUL is administered to patients with congestive heart failure , severe renal insufficiency , or with conditions in which there is sodium retention with edema .
( 5 . 2 ) • • Extravasation : Extravasation of AMMONUL into the perivenous tissues during high flow bolus infusion may lead to skin necrosis , especially in infants .
The infusion site must be monitored closely for possible tissue infiltration during drug administration .
( 5 . 3 ) • • Neurotoxicity of Phenylacetate : Because of prolonged plasma levels achieved by phenylacetate in pharmacokinetic studies , repeat loading doses should not be administered .
Additionally , neurotoxicity related to phenylacetate has been reported in cancer patients .
Monitor patients for symptoms of acute neurotoxicity .
( 5 . 4 ) • • Hyperventilation and Metabolic Acidosis : AMMONUL may cause side effects typically associated with salicylate overdose , such as hyperventilation and metabolic acidosis .
Monitor patient blood chemistry profiles and perform frequent blood pH and pCO2 measurements .
( 5 . 5 ) 5 . 1 Decreased Potassium Levels Because urine potassium loss is enhanced by the excretion of the non - reabsorbable anions , phenylacetylglutamine and hippurate , plasma potassium levels should be carefully monitored and appropriate treatment given when necessary .
5 . 2 Conditions Associated with Fluid Overload AMMONUL contains 30 . 5 mg of sodium per mL of undiluted product .
Thus , AMMONUL should be used with great care , if at all , in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency , and in clinical states in which there is sodium retention with edema .
Discontinue administration of AMMONUL , evaluate the patient , and institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures if an adverse event occurs .
5 . 3 Extravasation Administration must be through a central venous catheter .
Administration through a peripheral line may cause burns .
Bolus infusion flow rates are relatively high , especially for infants [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Extravasation of AMMONUL into the perivenous tissues may lead to skin necrosis .
If extravasation is suspected , discontinue the infusion and resume at a different infusion site , if necessary .
The infusion site must be monitored closely for possible infiltration during drug administration .
Do not administer undiluted product .
5 . 4 Neurotoxicity of Phenylacetate Because of prolonged plasma levels achieved by phenylacetate in pharmacokinetic studies , repeat loading doses of AMMONUL should not be administered .
Additionally , neurotoxicity was reported in cancer patients receiving intravenous phenylacetate , 250 – 300 mg / kg / day for 14 days , repeated at 4 - week intervals .
Manifestations were predominantly somnolence , fatigue , and lightheadedness , with less frequent headaches , dysgeusia , hypoacusis , disorientation , impaired memory , and exacerbation of a pre - existing neuropathy .
The acute onset of symptoms upon initiation of treatment and reversibility of symptoms when the phenylacetate was discontinued suggest a drug effect [ see Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology ( 13 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 5 Hyperventilation and Metabolic Acidosis Due to structural similarities between phenylacetate and benzoate to salicylate , AMMONUL may cause side effects typically associated with salicylate overdose , such as hyperventilation and metabolic acidosis .
Monitoring of blood chemistry profiles , blood pH and pCO2 should be performed .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most frequently reported adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 6 % ) are vomiting , hyperglycemia , hypokalemia , convulsions , and mental impairment .
( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Bausch Health US , LLC at 1 - 800 - 321 - 4576 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
The safety data were obtained from 316 patients who received AMMONUL as emergency ( rescue ) or prospective treatment for hyperammonemia as part of an uncontrolled , open - label study .
The study population included patients between the ages of 0 to 53 years with a mean ( SD ) of 6 . 2 ( 8 . 54 ) years ; 51 % were male and 49 % were female who had the following diagnoses : OTC ( 46 % ) , ASS ( 22 % ) , CPS ( 12 % ) , ASL ( 2 % ) , ARG ( < 1 % ) , THN ( < 1 % ) , and other ( 18 % ) .
Adverse reactions were reported with similar frequency in patients with OTC , ASS , CPS , and diagnoses categorized as " other . "
Nervous system disorders were more frequent in patients with OTC and CPS , compared with patients with ASS and patients with " other " diagnoses .
Convulsions and mental impairment were reported in patients with OTC and CPS .
These observations are consistent with literature reports that patients with enzyme deficiencies occurring earlier in the urea cycle ( i . e . , OTC and CPS ) tend to be more severely affected .
Adverse reactions profiles differed by age group .
Patients ≤ 30 days of age had more blood and lymphatic system disorders and vascular disorders ( specifically hypotension ) , while patients > 30 days of age had more gastrointestinal disorders ( specifically nausea , vomiting and diarrhea ) .
Less common adverse reactions ( < 3 % of patients ) that are characterized as severe are listed below by body system .
BLOOD AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEM DISORDERS : coagulopathy , pancytopenia , thrombocytopenia CARDIAC DISORDERS : atrial rupture , bradycardia , cardiac or cardiopulmonary arrest / failure , cardiogenic shock , cardiomyopathy , pericardial effusion EYE DISORDERS : blindness GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS : abdominal distension , gastrointestinal hemorrhage GENERAL DISORDERS AND ADMINISTRATION - SITE CONDITIONS : asthenia , brain death , chest pain , multiorgan failure , edema HEPATOBILIARY DISORDERS : cholestasis , hepatic artery stenosis , hepatic failure / hepatotoxicity , jaundice INFECTIONS AND INFESTATIONS : sepsis / septic shock INJURY , POISONING AND PROCEDURAL COMPLICATIONS : brain herniation , subdural hematoma , overdose INVESTIGATIONS : blood carbon dioxide changes , blood glucose changes , blood pH increased , cardiac output decreased , pCO2 changes , respiratory rate increased METABOLISM AND NUTRITION DISORDERS : alkalosis , dehydration , fluid overload / retention , hypoglycemia , hyperkalemia , hypernatremia , alkalosis , tetany NEOPLASMS BENIGN , MALIGNANT AND UNSPECIFIED : hemangioma acquired NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS : areflexia , ataxia , brain infarction , brain hemorrhage , cerebral atrophy , clonus , depressed level of consciousness , encephalopathy , nerve paralysis , intracranial pressure increased , subdural hematoma , tremor PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS : acute psychosis , aggression , confusional state , hallucinations RENAL AND URINARY DISORDERS : anuria , renal failure , urinary retention RESPIRATORY , THORACIC AND MEDIASTINAL DISORDERS : acute respiratory distress syndrome , dyspnea , hypercapnia , hyperventilation , Kussmaul respiration , pneumonia aspiration , pneumothorax , pulmonary hemorrhage , pulmonary edema , respiratory acidosis or alkalosis , respiratory arrest / failure SKIN AND SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE DISORDERS : alopecia , blister , pruritus generalized , rash , urticaria VASCULAR DISORDERS : flushing , hemorrhage , hypertension , phlebothrombosis / thrombosis Table 2 : Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥ 3 % of Patients Treated with AMMONUL Patients N = 316 Number of patients with any adverse event 163 ( 52 % ) Blood and lymphatic system disorders 35 ( 11 % ) • Anemia 12 ( 4 % ) • Disseminated intravascular coagulation 11 ( 3 % ) Cardiac disorders 28 ( 9 % ) Gastrointestinal disorders 42 ( 13 % ) • Diarrhea 10 ( 3 % ) • Nausea 9 ( 3 % ) • Vomiting 29 ( 9 % ) General disorders and administration - site conditions 45 ( 14 % ) • Injection - site reaction 11 ( 3 % ) • Pyrexia 17 ( 5 % ) Infections 39 ( 12 % ) • Urinary tract infection 9 ( 3 % ) Injury , poisoning and procedural complications 12 ( 4 % ) Investigations 32 ( 10 % ) Metabolism and nutrition disorders 67 ( 21 % ) • Acidosis 8 ( 3 % ) • Hyperammonemia 17 ( 5 % ) • Hyperglycemia 22 ( 7 % ) • Hypocalcemia 8 ( 3 % ) • Hypokalemia 23 ( 7 % ) • Metabolic acidosis 13 ( 4 % ) Nervous system disorders 71 ( 22 % ) • Brain edema 17 ( 5 % ) • Coma 10 ( 3 % ) • Convulsions 19 ( 6 % ) • Mental impairment 18 ( 6 % ) Psychiatric disorders 16 ( 5 % ) • Agitation 8 ( 3 % ) Renal and urinary disorders 14 ( 4 % ) Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders 47 ( 15 % ) • Respiratory distress 9 ( 3 % ) Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 19 ( 6 % ) Vascular disorders 19 ( 6 % ) • Hypotension 14 ( 4 % ) 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Formal drug interaction studies have not been performed with AMMONUL .
Some antibiotics such as penicillin may compete with phenylacetylglutamine and hippurate for active secretion by renal tubules , which may affect the overall disposition of the infused drug .
Probenecid is known to inhibit the renal transport of many organic compounds , including aminohippuric acid , and may affect renal excretion of phenylacetylglutamine and hippurate .
There have been reports that valproic acid can induce hyperammonemia through inhibition of the synthesis of N - acetylglutamate , a co - factor for carbamyl phosphate synthetase .
Therefore , administration of valproic acid to patients with urea cycle disorders may exacerbate their condition and antagonize the efficacy of AMMONUL .
Use of corticosteroids may cause a protein catabolic state and , thereby , potentially increase plasma ammonia levels in patients with impaired ability to form urea .
• • Some antibiotics such as penicillin may affect the overall disposition of the infused drug .
( 7 ) • • Probenecid may affect renal excretion of phenylacetylglutamine and hippurate .
( 7 ) • • Valproic acid given to patients with urea cycle disorders may exacerbate their condition and antagonize the efficacy of AMMONUL through inhibition of the synthesis of N - acetylglutamate , a co - factor for carbamyl phosphate synthetase .
( 7 ) • • Use of corticosteroids may cause the breakdown of body protein and potentially increase plasma ammonia levels in patients with impaired ability to form urea .
( 7 ) 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data with AMMONUL use in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with AMMONUL .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % , and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of sodium phenylacetate , sodium benzoate in either human or animal milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for AMMONUL and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from AMMONUL or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use AMMONUL has been used as a treatment for acute hyperammonemia in pediatric patients including patients in the early neonatal period [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of AMMONUL did not include any patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
Urea cycle disorders are presently diseases of the pediatric and younger adult populations .
No pharmacokinetic studies of AMMONUL have been performed in geriatric patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and concomitant disease or other drug therapy in this patient population .
8 . 6 Gender Pharmacokinetic parameters of AMMONUL were compared in healthy males and females .
Bioavailability of both benzoate and phenylacetate was slightly higher in females than in males .
However , conclusions cannot be drawn due to the limited number of subjects in this study .
8 . 7 Hepatic Insufficiency Limited information is available on the metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate in patients with impaired hepatic function .
However , metabolic conjugation of sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate is known to take place in the liver and kidney .
Therefore , caution should be used in administering AMMONUL to patients with hepatic insufficiency .
8 . 8 Renal Impairment The drug metabolites of AMMONUL ( phenylacetylglutamine and hippurate ) and subsequently ammonia are primarily excreted by the kidney .
Therefore , use caution and closely monitor patients with impaired renal function who receive AMMONUL .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage has been reported during AMMONUL treatment in urea cycle - deficient patients .
All patients in the uncontrolled open - label study were to be treated with the same dose of AMMONUL .
However , some patients received more than the dose level specified in the protocol .
In 16 of the 64 deaths , the patient received a known overdose of AMMONUL .
Causes of death in these patients included cardiorespiratory failure / arrest ( 6 patients ) , hyperammonemia ( 3 patients ) , increased intracranial pressure ( 2 patients ) , pneumonitis with septic shock and coagulopathy ( 1 patient ) , error in dialysis procedure ( 1 patient ) , respiratory failure ( 1 patient ) , intractable hypotension and probable sepsis ( 1 patient ) , and unknown ( 1 patient ) .
Additionally , other signs of intoxication may include obtundation ( in the absence of hyperammonemia ) , hyperventilation , a severe compensated metabolic acidosis , perhaps with a respiratory component , large anion gap , hypernatremia and hyperosmolarity , progressive encephalopathy , cardiovascular collapse , and death .
In case of overdose of AMMONUL , discontinue the drug and institute appropriate emergency medical monitoring and procedures .
In severe cases , the latter may include hemodialysis ( procedure of choice ) or peritoneal dialysis ( when hemodialysis is unavailable ) .
11 DESCRIPTION AMMONUL ( sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate ) Injection 10 % per 10 % ( a nitrogen binding agent ) is a sterile , concentrated , aqueous solution of sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate .
The pH of the solution is between 6 and 8 .
Sodium phenylacetate is a white to off - white powder .
It is soluble in water .
Sodium benzoate is a white to off - white powder that is readily soluble in water .
Figure 1 [ MULTIMEDIA ] Sodium phenylacetate has a molecular weight of 158 . 14 and the molecular formula C8H7NaO2 .
Sodium benzoate has a molecular weight of 144 . 10 and the molecular formula C7H5NaO2 .
Each mL of AMMONUL contains 100 mg of sodium phenylacetate and 100 mg of sodium benzoate , and Water for Injection .
Sodium hydroxide and / or hydrochloric acid may have been used for pH adjustment .
AMMONUL injection is a sterile , concentrated solution intended for intravenous administration via a central venous catheter only after dilution [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Urea cycle disorders can result from decreased activity of any of the following enzymes : N - acetylglutamate synthetase ( NAGS ) , carbamyl phosphate synthetase ( CPS ) , argininosuccinate synthetase ( ASS ) , ornithine transcarbamylase ( OTC ) , argininosuccinate lyase ( ASL ) , or arginase ( ARG ) .
Sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate are metabolically active compounds that can serve as alternatives to urea for the excretion of waste nitrogen .
Figure 2 is a schematic illustrating how the components of AMMONUL , phenylacetate and benzoate , provide an alternative pathway for nitrogen disposal in patients without a fully functioning urea cycle .
Phenylacetate conjugates with glutamine in the liver and kidneys to form phenylacetylglutamine , via acetylation .
Phenylacetylglutamine is excreted by the kidneys via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion .
The nitrogen content of phenylacetylglutamine per mole is identical to that of urea ( both contain two moles of nitrogen ) .
Two moles of nitrogen are removed per mole of phenylacetate when it is conjugated with glutamine .
Similarly , preceded by acylation , benzoate conjugates with glycine to form hippuric acid , which is rapidly excreted by the kidneys by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion .
One mole of hippuric acid contains one mole of waste nitrogen .
Thus , one mole of nitrogen is removed per mole of benzoate when it is conjugated with glycine .
Figure 2 [ MULTIMEDIA ] • CPS = carbamyl phosphate synthetase ; • OTC = ornithine transcarbamylase ; • ASS = argininosuccinate synthetase ; • ASL = argininosuccinate lyase ; • ARG = arginase ; • NAGS = N - acetylglutamate synthetase [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with hyperammonemia due to deficiencies in enzymes of the urea cycle , AMMONUL has been shown to decrease elevated plasma ammonia levels .
These effects are considered to be the result of reduction in nitrogen overload through glutamine and glycine scavenging by AMMONUL in combination with appropriate dietary and other supportive measures .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered AMMONUL was characterized in healthy adult volunteers .
Both benzoate and phenylacetate exhibited nonlinear kinetics .
Following 90 - minute intravenous infusion mean AUClast for benzoate was 20 . 3 , 114 . 9 , 564 . 6 , 562 . 8 , and 1599 . 1 mcg / mL following doses of 1 , 2 , 3 . 75 , 4 , and 5 . 5 g / m2 , respectively .
The total clearance decreased from 5 . 19 to 3 . 62 L / h / m2 at the 3 . 75 and 5 . 5 g / m2 doses , respectively .
Similarly , phenylacetate exhibited nonlinear kinetics following the priming dose regimens .
AUClast was 175 . 6 , 713 . 8 , 2040 . 6 , 2181 . 6 , and 3829 . 2 mcg ∙ h / mL following doses of 1 , 2 , 3 . 75 , 4 , and 5 . 5 g / m2 , respectively .
The total clearance decreased from 1 . 82 to 0 . 89 mcg ∙ h / mL with increasing dose ( 3 . 75 and 4 g / m2 , respectively ) .
During the sequence of 90 - minute priming infusion followed by a 24 - hour maintenance infusion , phenylacetate was detected in the plasma at the end of infusion ( Tmax of 2 hr at 3 . 75 g / m2 ) whereas , benzoate concentrations declined rapidly ( Tmax of 1 . 5 hr at 3 . 75 g / m2 ) and were undetectable at 14 and 26 hours following the 3 . 75 and 4 g / m2 dose , respectively .
A difference in the metabolic rates for phenylacetate and benzoate was noted .
The formation of hippurate from benzoate occurred more rapidly than that of phenylacetylglutamine from phenylacetate , and the rate of elimination for hippurate appeared to be more rapid than that for phenylacetylglutamine .
Pharmacokinetic observations have also been reported from twelve episodes of hyperammonemic encephalopathy in seven children diagnosed ( age 3 to 26 months ) with urea cycle disorders who had been administered AMMONUL intravenously .
These data showed peak plasma levels of phenylacetate and benzoate at approximately the same times as were observed in healthy adults .
As in healthy adults , the plasma levels of phenylacetate were higher than benzoate and were present for a longer time .
The pharmacokinetics of intravenous phenylacetate have been reported following administration to adult patients with advanced solid tumors .
The decline in serum phenylacetate concentrations following a loading infusion of 150 mg / kg was consistent with saturable enzyme kinetics .
Ninety - nine percent of administered phenylacetate was excreted as phenylacetylglutamine .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of AMMONUL .
Studies to evaluate the possible impairment of fertility or mutagenic potential of AMMONUL have not been performed .
Results indicate that sodium benzoate is not mutagenic or carcinogenic , and does not impair fertility .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology In animal studies , subcutaneous administration to rat pups of 190 – 474 mg / kg of phenylacetate caused decreased proliferation and increased loss of neurons , and reduced central nervous system ( CNS ) myelin .
Cerebral synapse maturation was retarded , and the number of functioning nerve terminals in the cerebrum was reduced , which resulted in impaired brain growth .
Pregnant rats were given phenylacetate at 3 . 5 µmol / g / day subcutaneously from gestation day 7 through normal delivery .
Prenatal exposure of rat pups to phenylacetate produced lesions in layer 5 cortical pyramidal cells ; dendritic spines were longer and thinner than normal and reduced in number .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of AMMONUL in improving patient survival of acute hyperammonemic episodes was demonstrated in an analysis of 316 patients ( 1 , 045 episodes of hospitalization ) treated between 1981 and 2003 .
The demographic characteristics and diagnoses of the patient population are shown in Table 3 .
Table 3 : Baseline Characteristics and Diagnoses of Study Population Patients [ 1 ] N = 316 Gender Male 158 ( 51 % ) Female 150 ( 49 % ) Age ( years ) N 310 Mean ( SD ) 6 . 2 ( 8 . 54 ) Min – Max 0 . 0 – 53 . 0 Age groups 0 – 30 days 104 ( 34 % ) 31 days – 2 years 55 ( 18 % ) > 2 – 12 years 90 ( 29 % ) > 12 – 16 years 30 ( 10 % ) > 16 years 31 ( 10 % ) Enzyme OTC 146 ( 46 % ) deficiency ASS 71 ( 22 % ) CPS 38 ( 12 % ) ASL 7 ( 2 % ) ARG 2 ( < 1 % ) THN 2 ( < 1 % ) Other [ 2 ] 56 ( 18 % ) [ 1 ] For the summary at the patient level , data obtained at first episode used .
[ 2 ] Diagnosis unknown or pending ( 33 episodes ) , acidemia ( 14 episodes ) , HHH syndrome ( 6 episodes ) , carnitine translocase deficiency ( 4 episodes ) , liver disease ( 3 episodes ) , HMG CoA lyase deficiency ( 1 episode ) , non - ketotic hyperglycinemia ( 1 episode ) , suspected fatty acid oxidation deficiency ( 1 episode ) , and valproic - acid - induced hyperammonemia ( 1 episode ) .
On admission to the hospital , patients with hyperammonemia and a suspected or confirmed urea cycle disorder ( UCD ) diagnosis were treated with a bolus dose of 0 . 25 g / kg ( or 5 . 5 g / m2 ) sodium phenylacetate + 0 . 25 g / kg ( or 5 . 5 g / m2 ) sodium benzoate over a period of 90 minutes to 6 hours , depending on the specific UCD .
Infusions also contained arginine ; the dose of arginine depended on the specific UCD .
After completion of the bolus dose , maintenance infusions of the same dose over 24 hours were continued until the patient was no longer hyperammonemic or oral therapy could be tolerated .
The mean ( SD ) duration of treatment was 4 . 6 ( 6 . 45 ) days per episode , and ranged from 1 to 72 days .
Survival was substantially improved after AMMONUL treatment compared with historical values ( estimated 14 % 1 - year survival rate with dietary therapy alone ) and with dialysis ( estimated 43 % survival of acute hyperammonemia ) .
Eighty percent of patients ( 252 of 316 ) survived their last episode .
Of the 64 patients who died , 53 ( 83 % ) died during their first hyperammonemic episode .
Of the 104 neonates ( < 30 d ) treated with AMMONUL , 34 ( 33 % ) died during the first hyperammonemic episode .
Ammonia levels decreased from very high levels ( > 4 times the upper limit of normal [ ULN ] ) to lower levels in 91 % of episodes after treatment .
In patients responding to therapy , mean ammonia concentrations decreased from 200 . 9 µmol / L at hour zero to 101 . 6 µmol / L within four hours of initiation of AMMONUL therapy and were maintained .
Hemodialysis is recommended for those patients whose plasma ammonia levels fail to fall below 150 µmol / L or by more than 40 % within 4 to 8 hours after receiving AMMONUL .
A shift from high ( ≤ 4 times ULN ) to very high ( > 4 times ULN ) levels was observed in only 4 % of the episodes .
Overall , investigators rated neurological status as improved , much improved , or the same in 93 % of episodes , and overall status in response to treatment as improved , much improved , or the same in 97 % of episodes .
Recovery from coma was observed in 97 % of episodes where coma was present at admission ( 111 of 114 episodes ) .
