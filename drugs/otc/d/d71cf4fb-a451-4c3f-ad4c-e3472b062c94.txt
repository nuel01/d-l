PYRANTEL PAMOATE READ THIS INSERT THOROUGHLY BEFORE TAKING THIS PRODUCT .
This brochure will tell you about pinworms and how to treat infections effectively with Pyrantel Pamoate .
Many who have pinworms do not have symptoms .
Nevertheless , many will experience itching in and around the rectal opening .
The itching may be very annoying and continued scratching can cause an irritation in this area .
The itching may be presented at night when sleeping .
That is why restless sleep is sometimes a sign of pinworms , especially in children .
It is important for you to realize that you should only treat with Pyrantel Pamoate if you have seen and identified the pinworms .
Pinworms look like tiny white threads .
The female pinworm is about ½ long ( the male pinworm is shorter ) .
They live in the bowel .
Usually , at night , the female travels to the rectal opening and lays eggs within the skin folds around the opening .
This usually takes place within one to two hours after the child has been put to bed for the night .
The sticky gelatin - like substance in which the eggs ( they are too small to see ) are deposited and the movement of the female pinworm may cause annoying itching and possibly restless sleep .
By checking the rectal opening at this time , you can attempt to see the pinworm as described .
The pinworm eggs normally survive for as long as three weeks .
In that time , the pinworm egg may hatch and the pinworm will travel back within the rectal opening into the bowel .
The pinworm reaches maturity in the bowel within two to six weeks and the life cycle repeats itself .
Scratching will cause pinworm eggs to stick to the fingers .
Reinfection will result if the fingers are placed in the mouth .
The eggs , which are too small to see , contaminate whatever they come in contact with : bed clothes , underwear , toys , hands , and food touched by contaminated hands .
Even eggs floating in the air can be swallowed and cause infection .
Eggs deposited in the environment , as stated above , can survive for as long as three weeks .
Pinworms are highly contagious .
Even the cleanest and most careful people can get them .
After treatment with Pyrantel Pamoate , there are some rules to follow to try to prevent spreading to others and reinfection : • Wash hands and fingernails with soap often during the day , especially before eating and after using the toilet .
• Wear tight underpants both day and night .
Change them daily .
• For several days after treatment , clean the bedroom floor by vacuuming or damp mopping .
Avoid dry sweeping that may stir up dust .
• After treatment , wash bed linens and night clothes ( do n't shake them ) .
• Keep the toilet seats clean .
