Erythromycin ( ( 3 R * , 4 S * , 5 S * , 6 R * , 7 R * , 9 R * , 11 R * , 12 R * , 13 S * , 14 R * ) - 4 - [ ( 2 , 6 - dideoxy - 3 - C - methyl - 3 - O - methyl - α - L - ribo - hexopyranosyl ) - oxy ] - 14 - ethyl - 7 , 12 , 13 - trihydroxy - 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 13 - hexamethyl - 6 - [ [ 3 , 4 , 6 - trideoxy - 3 - ( dimethyl - amino ) - β - D - xylo - hexopyranosyl ] oxy ] oxacyclotetradecane - 2 , 10 - dione ) ) is an antibiotic produced from a strain of Streptomyces erythraeus .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Each gram contains Erythromycin USP 5 mg in a sterile ophthalmic base of mineral oil and white petrolatum .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Microbiology : Erythromycin inhibits protein synthesis without affecting nucleic acid synthesis .
Erythromycin is usually active against the following organisms in vitro and in clinical infections : Streptococcus pyogenes ( group A β - hemolytic ) Alpha - hemolytic streptococci ( viridans group ) Staphylococcus aureus , including penicillinase - producing strains ( methicillin - resistant staphylococci are uniformly resistant to erythromycin ) Streptococcus pneumoniae Mycoplasma pneumoniae ( Eaton Agent , PPLO ) Haemophilus influenzae ( not all strains of this organism are susceptible at the erythromycin concentrations ordinarily achieved ) Treponema pallidum Corynebacterium diphtheriae Neisseria gonorrhoeae Chlamydia trachomatis INDICATIONS AND USAGE : For the treatment of superficial ocular infections involving the conjunctiva and / or cornea caused by organisms susceptible to erythromycin .
For prophylaxis of ophthalmia neonatorum due to N . gonorrhoeae or C . trachomatis .
The effectiveness of erythromycin in the prevention of ophthalmia caused by penicillinase - producing N . gonorrhoeae is not established .
For infants born to mothers with clinically apparent gonorrhea , intravenous or intramuscular injections of aqueous crystalline penicillin G should be given ; a single dose of 50 , 000 units for term infants or 20 , 000 units for infants of low birth weight .
Topical prophylaxis alone is inadequate for these infants .
CONTRAINDICATIONS : This drug is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to erythromycin .
PRECAUTIONS : General : The use of antimicrobial agents may be associated with the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms including fungi ; in such a case , antibiotic administration should be stopped and appropriate measures taken .
Information for Patients : Avoid contaminating the applicator tip with material from the eye , fingers , or other source .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Two year oral studies conducted in rats with erythromycin did not provide evidence of tumorigenicity .
Mutagenicity studies have not been conducted .
No evidence of impaired fertility that appeared related to erythromycin was reported in animal studies .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category B . Reproduction studies have been performed in rats , mice , and rabbits using erythromycin and its various salts and esters , at doses that were several multiples of the usual human dose .
No evidence of harm to the fetus that appeared related to erythromycin was reported in these studies .
There are , however , no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response , the erythromycins should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers : Caution should be exercised when erythromycin is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use - See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION .
Geriatric Use : No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients .
ADVERSE REACTIONS : The most frequently reported adverse reactions are minor ocular irritations , redness , and hypersensitivity reactions .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : In the treatment of superficial ocular infections , a ribbon approximately 1 cm in length of Erythromycin Opthalmic Ointment should be applied directly to the infected structure up to 6 times daily , depending on the severity of the infection .
For prophylaxis of neonatal gonococcal or chlamydial conjunctivitis , a ribbon of ointment approximately 1 cm in length should be instilled into each lower conjunctival sac .
The ointment should not be flushed from the eye following instillation .
A new tube should be used for each infant .
