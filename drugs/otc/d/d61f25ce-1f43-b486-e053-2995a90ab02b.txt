1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Potassium chloride extended - release capsules are indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of hypokalemia in adults and children with or without metabolic alkalosis , in patients for whom dietary management with potassium - rich foods or diuretic dose reduction is insufficient .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2 . 1 Administration and Monitoring If serum potassium concentration is < 2 . 5 mEq / L , use intravenous potassium instead of oral supplementation .
Monitoring Monitor serum potassium and adjust dosages accordingly .
Monitor serum potassium periodically during maintenance therapy to ensure potassium remains in desired range .
The treatment of potassium depletion , particularly in the presence of cardiac disease , renal disease , or acidosis requires careful attention to acid - base balance , volume status , electrolytes , including magnesium , sodium , chloride , phosphate , and calcium , electrocardiograms and the clinical status of the patient .
Correct volume status , acid - base balance and electrolyte deficits as appropriate .
Administration Take with meals and with a full glass of water or other liquid .
Do not take on an empty stomach because of the potential for gastric irritation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules may sprinkle the contents of the capsule onto a spoonful of soft food .
The soft food , such as applesauce or pudding , should be swallowed immediately without chewing and followed with a glass of water or juice to ensure complete swallowing of the microcapsules .
Do not added to hot foods .
Any microcapsule / food mixture should be used immediately and not stored for future use .
2 . 2 Adult Dosing Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient .
Dosages greater than 40 mEq per day should be divided such that no more than 40 mEq is given in a single dose .
Treatment of hypokalemia : Typical dose range is 40 to 100 mEq per day .
Maintenance or Prophylaxis : Typical dose is 20 mEq per day .
2 . 3 Pediatric Dosing Pediatric patients aged birth to 16 years old : Dosage must be adjusted to the individual needs of each patient .
Do not exceed as a single dose 1 mEq / kg or 20 mEq , whichever is lower .
Treatment of hypokalemia : The recommended initial dose is 2 to 4 mEq / kg / day in divided doses .
If deficits are severe or ongoing losses are great , consider intravenous therapy .
Maintenance or Prophylaxis : Typical dose is 1 mEq / kg / day .

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Potassium chloride extended - release capsules are contraindicated in patients on amiloride or triamterene .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5 . 1 Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions Solid oral dosage forms of potassium chloride can produce ulcerative and / or stenotic lesions of the gastrointestinal tract , particularly if the drug is in contact with the gastrointestinal mucosa for a prolonged period of time .
Consider the use of liquid potassium in patients with dysphagia , swallowing disorders , or severe gastrointestinal motility disorders .
If severe vomiting , abdominal pain , distention , or gastrointestinal bleeding occurs , discontinue potassium chloride extended - release capsules and consider possibility of ulceration , obstruction or perforation .
Potassium chloride extended - release capsules should not be taken on an empty stomach because of its potential for gastric irritation [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions have been identified with use of oral potassium salts .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
The most common adverse reactions to oral potassium salts are nausea , vomiting , flatulence , abdominal pain / discomfort , and diarrhea .
There have been reports of hyperkalemia and of upper and lower gastrointestinal conditions including , obstruction , bleeding , ulceration , and perforation .
Skin rash has been reported rarely .
To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals , Inc . at 1 - 800 - 399 - 2561 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Amiloride and Triamterene Use with triamterene or amiloride can produce severe hyperkalemia .
Concomitant use is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
7 . 2 Renin - Angiotensin - Aldosterone Inhibitors Drugs that inhibit the renin - angiotensin - aldosternone system ( RAAS ) including angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors , angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs ) , spironolactone , eplerenone , or aliskiren produces potassium retention by inhibiting aldosterone production .
Closely monitor potassium in patients taking drugs that inhibit RAAS .
7 . 3 Nonsteroidal Anti - Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) NSAIDs may produce potassium retention by reducing renal synthesis of prostaglandin E and impairing the renin - angiotensin system .
Closely monitor potassium in patients taking NSAIDS .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no human data related to use of potassium chloride extended - release capsules during pregnancy and animal reproductive studies have not been conducted .
Potassium supplementation that does not lead to hyperkalemia is not expected to cause fetal harm .
The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage in the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary The normal potassium ion content of human milk is about 13 mEq per liter .
Since oral potassium becomes part of the body potassium pool , as long as body potassium is not excessive , the contribution of potassium chloride supplementation should have little or no effect on the level in human milk .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Clinical trial data from published literature have demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of potassium chloride in children with diarrhea and malnutrition from birth to 18 years .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of potassium chloride did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
8 . 6 Cirrhotics Based on publish literature , the baseline corrected serum concentrations of potassium measured over 3 hours after administration in cirrhotic subjects who received an oral potassium load rose to approximately twice that of normal subjects who received the same load .
Patients with cirrhosis should usually be started at the low end of the dosing range , and the serum potassium level should be monitored frequently [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment Patients with renal impairment have reduced urinary excretion of potassium and are at substantially increased risk of hyperkalemia .
Patients with impaired renal function , particularly if the patient is on RAAS inhibitors or nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , should usually be started at the low end of the dosing range because of the potential for development of hyperkalemia [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 , 7 . 3 ] .
The serum potassium level should be monitored frequently .
Renal function should be assessed periodically .
10 OVERDOSAGE 10 . 1 Symptoms The administration of oral potassium salts to persons with normal excretory mechanisms for potassium rarely causes serious hyperkalemia .
However , if excretory mechanisms are impaired , potentially fatal hyperkalemia can result .
Hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic and may be manifested only by an increased serum potassium concentration ( 6 . 5 to 8 . 0 mEq / L ) and characteristic electrocardiographic changes ( peaking of T - waves , loss of P - waves , depression of S - T segment , and prolongation of the QT - interval ) .
Late manifestations include muscle paralysis and cardiovascular collapse from cardiac arrest ( 9 to 12 mEq / L ) .
10 . 2 Treatment Treatment measures for hyperkalemia include the following : • Monitor closely for arrhythmias and electrolyte changes .
• Eliminate foods and medications containing potassium and any agents with potassium - sparing properties such as potassium - sparing diuretics , ARBs , ACE inhibitors , NSAIDs , certain nutritional supplements , and many others .
• Administer intravenous calcium gluconate if the patient is at no risk or low risk of developing digitalis toxicity .
• Administer 300 to 500 mL / hr of 10 % dextrose solution containing 10 to 20 units of crystalline insulin per 1 , 000 mL .
• Correct acidosis , if present , with intravenous sodium bicarbonate .
• Use exchange resins , hemodialysis , or peritoneal dialysis .
In patients who have been stabilized on digitalis , too rapid a lowering of the serum potassium concentration can produce digitalis toxicity .
The extended - release feature means that absorption and toxic effects may be delayed for hours .
Consider standard measures to remove any unabsorbed drug .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action The potassium ion ( K + ) is the principal intracellular cation of most body tissues .
Potassium ions participate in a number of essential physiological processes , including the maintenance of intracellular tonicity ; the transmission of nerve impulses ; the contraction of cardiac , skeletal , and smooth muscle ; and the maintenance of normal renal function .
The intracellular concentration of potassium is approximately 150 to 160 mEq per liter .
The normal adult plasma concentration is 3 . 5 to 5 mEq per liter .
An active ion transport system maintains this gradient across the plasma membrane .
Potassium is a normal dietary constituent and under steady - state conditions the amount of potassium absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is equal to the amount excreted in the urine .
The usual dietary intake of potassium is 50 to 100 mEq per day .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Each crystal of KCl is microencapsulated and allows for the controlled release of potassium and chloride ions over an eight - to ten - hour period .
Specific Populations Cirrhotics Based on publish literature , the baseline corrected serum concentrations of potassium measured over 3 hours after administration in cirrhotic subjects who received an oral potassium load rose to approximately twice that of normal subjects who received the same load .
