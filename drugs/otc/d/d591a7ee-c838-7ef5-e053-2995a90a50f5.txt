Monitor patients for symptoms , including symptomatic orthostatic hypotension .
( 5 . 1 ) • Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension : Episodes of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension including inability to stand without support may occur in patients following treatment with Moxidectin Tablets .
( 5 . 2 ) • Encephalopathy in Loa loaCo - Infected Patients : Serious or even fatal encephalopathy following treatment with Moxidectin Tablets may occur in patients co - infected with Loa loa .
Assess patients for loiasis in Loa loa endemic areas prior to treatment .
( 5 . 3 ) • Edema and Worsening of Onchodermatitis : Patients with hyper - reactive onchodermatitis ( sowda ) may be more likely than others to experience severe edema and aggravation of onchodermatitis .
( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Cutaneous , Ophthalmologicaland / or Systemic Adverse Reactions Treatment with Moxidectin Tablets may cause cutaneous , ophthalmological and / or systemic reactions of varying severity ( Mazzotti reaction ) .
These adverse reactions are due to allergic and inflammatory host responses to the death of microfilariae [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
There is a trend toward an increased incidence of these adverse reactions in patients with higher microfilarial burden .
The clinical manifestations of Mazzotti reaction includes pruritus , headache , pyrexia , rash , urticaria , hypotension ( including symptomatic orthostatic hypotension and dizziness ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] , tachycardia , edema , lymphadenopathy , arthralgia , myalgia , chills , paresthesia and asthenia .
Ophthalmological manifestations include conjunctivitis , eye pain , eye pruritus , eyelid swelling , blurred vision , photophobia , changes in visual acuity , hyperemia , ocular discomfort and watery eyes .
These adverse reactions generally occur and resolve in the first week post - treatment .
Laboratory changes include eosinophilia , eosinopenia , lymphocytopenia , neutropenia , and increases in alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , gamma glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) and lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) .
Proteinuria has also been reported .
Treatment of severe Mazzotti reactions has not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials .
Symptomatic treatments such as oral hydration , recumbency , intravenous normal saline , and / or parenteral corticosteroids have been used to treat orthostatic hypotension .
Antihistamines and / or analgesics have been used for most mild to moderate cases .
5 . 2 Symptomatic Orthostatic Hypotension An increased number of patients who received Moxidectin Tablets developed symptomatic orthostatic hypotension with inability to stand without support after lying down for 5 minutes ( in an orthostatic hypotension provocation test ) ; 47 / 978 ( 5 % ) compared with 8 / 494 ( 2 % ) who received ivermectin .
The decreases in blood pressure were transient , managed by resumption of recumbency and most commonly occurred on Days 1 and 2 post - treatment .
Advise patients that if they feel dizzy or light - headed after taking Moxidectin Tablets , they should lie down until the symptoms resolve .
5 . 3 Encephalopathy in Loa loa Co - infected Patients Patients with onchocerciasis who are also infected with Loa loa may develop a serious or even fatal encephalopathy following treatment with Moxidectin Tablets .
Moxidectin Tablets have not been studied in patients co - infected with Loa loa .
Therefore , it is recommended that individuals who warrant treatment with Moxidectin Tablets and have had exposure to Loa loa - endemic areas undergo diagnostic screening for loiasis prior to treatment .
5 . 4 Edema and Worsening of Onchodermatitis Patients with hyper - reactive onchodermatitis ( sowda ) may be more likely than others to experience severe edema and worsening of onchodermatitis following the use of Moxidectin Tablets .
Symptomatic treatment has been used to manage patients who have experienced edema and worsening of onchodermatitis .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended during treatment with Moxidectin Tablets and for 7 days after treatment .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from clinical trials on the use of Moxidectin Tablets in pregnant women are insufficient to establish whether there is a moxidectin - associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage .
Moxidectin administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis was not associated with significant embryo - fetal developmental effects at doses of approximately 15 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area ( BSA ) comparison .
When moxidectin was dosed orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis , no embryo - fetal developmental effects were observed at oral doses of moxidectin up to 24 times the recommended human dose based on BSA comparison ( see Data ) .
Daily administration of moxidectin by oral gavage to maternal female rats during organogenesis and through lactation was associated with decreased survival , adverse clinical signs , and decreased body weights in first - generation offspring during the lactation period at a moxidectin dose less than 2 - times the recommended human dose based on BSA comparison .
Additional findings in first - generation offspring at the same dose included delays in pinna unfolding , eye opening , and vaginal opening .
Other parameters , including reproduction and neurological development in first - generation offspring were not affected at any moxidectin dose ( see Data ) .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In a rat embryo - fetal development study , daily oral administration of moxidectin at 12 mg / kg / day ( approximately 15 times the recommended human dose of 8 mg based on BSA comparison ) during Gestation Days ( GDs ) 6 to 15 significantly increased the fetal incidence , but not the litter incidence of cleft palate and the fetal and litter incidence of a skeletal variation , wavy ribs , at a maternally toxic dose .
Mean maternal food consumption , body weights , and body weight gain were significantly decreased at moxidectin doses of 10 and 12 mg / kg / day compared to control values .
The no observed adverse effect level ( NOAEL ) value for maternal and fetal toxicity was considered to be 5 and 10 mg / kg / day respectively ( approximately 6 and 12 times , respectively , the recommended human dose based on BSA comparison ) .
In the rabbit , daily oral administration of moxidectin at ≥ 5 mg / kg / day from GD 7 to GD 19 was not associated with fetal weight loss or malformations but resulted in significantly decreased maternal food consumption and body weight gains .
The NOAEL values for maternal and fetal toxicity in the rabbit was 1 mg / kg / day and 10 mg / kg / day respectively ( approximately 2 times and 24 times , respectively , the recommended human dose based on BSA comparison ) .
In a pre - postnatal study , moxidectin doses of 0 . 2 and 0 . 5 mg / kg / day were administered by oral gavage to maternal female rats from GD 6 throughout the lactation period until LD 21 .
A third dose group that received maternal doses of 1 . 5 mg / kg / day moxidectin ( less than 2 - times the recommended human dose based on BSA comparison ) was divided into two cohorts with Cohort 1 receiving maternal doses from GD 6 until LD 10 and Cohort 2 receiving maternal doses from GD 6 until each individual animal littered , but not during the lactation period .
First - generation offspring in Cohort 1 had adverse clinical signs ( small body size , thin , weak , subdued / sluggish , pale , cold to touch , respiratory distress , blue coloration and / or no visible milk in stomach ) and decreased survival and body weights during the lactation period .
However , first - generation offspring in Cohort 2 did not experience adverse clinical signs , body weight loss , or reduced survival suggesting moxidectin in lactation milk was responsible for the adverse effects in offspring in Cohort 1 .
Additional findings included delays in pinna unfolding and eye opening in male and female offspring in both cohorts and delay of vaginal opening in female offspring in Cohort 2 .
No adverse effects were noted in offspring at a maternal dose of 0 . 5 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 6 times the recommended human dose based on BSA comparison ) .
Reproductive performance based on mating and fertility indices and neurological development were not affected in male and female first - generation offspring at any of the administered moxidectin doses .
In another pre - postnatal study in rats , parental oral administration of dietary moxidectin prior to mating , through mating , gestation , and lactation did not produce adverse effects in first - generation or second - generation offspring at a maternal NOAEL dose of 0 . 824 mg / kg / day ( approximately equivalent to the recommended human dose based on BSA comparison ) .
However , at moxidectin doses ≥ 1 . 1 mg / kg / day ( approximately equivalent to 1 . 3 times the recommended human dose based on BSA comparison ) , the survival and body weights of first - generation offspring were significantly decreased during the lactation period , and the number of live fetuses at birth was significantly decreased with a maternal moxidectin dose of 11 mg / kg / day ( approximately equivalent to 13 times the recommended human dose based on BSA comparison ) .
In this study , offspring were assessed for survival , body weights , and fertility , and developmental milestones were not assessed .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Moxidectin was detected in the milk of lactating women following a single 8 mg dose of Moxidectin Tablets ( see Data ) .
There are no data on the effects of Moxidectin Tablets on the breast - fed infant or milk production .
In a pre - postnatal study in rats , oral gavage administration of moxidectin at a dose less than 2 - times the recommended human dose based on BSA comparison during the lactation period resulted in adverse clinical signs , weight loss , and increased mortality in rat pups suggesting moxidectin in lactation milk was responsible for the adverse effects [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) , and Data ] .
Because of serious findings from the rat pre - postnatal study including weight loss and death , advise women that breastfeeding is not recommended at the time of treatment with Moxidectin Tablets and for 7 days after treatment .
Data A pharmacokinetic study in twelve healthy adult lactating women who were 21 to 100 weeks post partum evaluated the concentrations of moxidectin in plasma and breast milk collected over a period of 28 days following a single 8 mg dose of Moxidectin Tablets .
The mean ( ± SD ) exposure ratio of moxidectin present in human breast milk to that of human plasma was approximately 1 . 77 ( ± 0 . 66 ) over a collection period of 28 days .
The estimated mean ( ± SD ) total infant dose , assuming the infants would consume all the breast milk collected during the study , was 0 . 056 mg ( ± 0 . 024 mg ) , which would be approximately 0 . 70 % ( ± 0 . 30 % ) of the maternal dose .
Relative infant dose was estimated to be 8 . 73 % ( ± 0 . 024 mg ) .
The effects of moxidectin or its metabolites on the breast - fed child or milk production were not evaluated .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Moxidectin Tablets have been established in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older .
In Trial 1 , ( n = 53 patients aged 12 to 17 years ) , the safety and effectiveness was similar to that observed in adults [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of Moxidectin Tablets in pediatric patients under 12 years of age has not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients included in Trial 1 that were treated with Moxidectin Tablets , 83 were aged 65 and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of Moxidectin Tablets is necessary for patients with mild ( creatinine clearance ( CrCL ) 60 to 89 mL / min ) to moderate ( CrCL 30 to 59 mL / min ) renal impairment .
The safety of Moxidectin Tablets in patients with severe renal impairment ( CrCL 15 to 29 mL / min ) or end stage renal disease , is unknown [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE No specific antidote is available for overdose with Moxidectin Tablets .
If overdose occurs , the patient should be monitored for evidence of toxicity .
Treatment of overdose with Moxidectin Tablets consists of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient .
Supportive therapy , if indicated , should include parenteral fluids and electrolytes , respiratory support ( oxygen and mechanical ventilation if necessary ) and pressor agents if clinically significant hypotension is present .

Distribution The apparent mean ± SD volume of distribution of moxidectin is 2421 ± 1658 L in patients with onchocerciasis .
The plasma protein binding in humans is unknown .
Elimination The mean terminal half - life of moxidectin in patients with onchocerciasis is 23 . 3 days ( 559 hours ) following a single 8 mg dose of Moxidectin Tablets .
The apparent mean ± SD total clearance of moxidectin is approximately 3 . 50 ± 1 . 23 L / hour in patients with onchocerciasis .
Metabolism The hepatic metabolism of moxidectin is minimal .
Excretion Following administration of a single 8 mg oral dose of Moxidectin Tablets to healthy subjects , 2 % of the dose is eliminated unchanged in the feces within the first 72 hours .
Renal elimination of intact drug is negligible .
Specific Populations In clinical studies , no clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of moxidectin were observed based on age ( 18 to 60 years ) , sex , weight ( 42 . 7 to 107 . 2 kg ) , or renal impairment ( creatinine clearance ( CrCL ) 47 to 89 mL / min , estimated by Cockcroft - Gault ) .
The pharmacokinetics of moxidectin in patients with CrCL less than 47 mL / min is unknown .
The pharmacokinetics of moxidectin in patients with hepatic impairment is unknown .
Patients with Renal Impairment Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis and the fact that renal elimination of intact drug is negligible , mild ( creatinine clearance ( CrCL ) , estimated by Cockcroft - Gault of 60 to 89 mL / min ) and moderate ( CrCL 30 to 59 mL / min ) renal impairment is not likely to have an impact on the exposure of moxidectin .
The effect of severe renal impairment ( CrCL 15 to 29 mL / min ) or of end - stage renal disease on the pharmacokinetics of moxidectin is unknown .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Study with Midazolam ( CYP3A4 substrate ) Co - administration of a single 8 mg dose of Moxidectin Tablets with a single oral 7 . 5 mg dose of midazolam ( a sensitive CYP3A substrate ) to healthy subjects ( n = 37 ) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam or its major metabolite , 1 - hydroxy midazolam .
In Vitro Studies CYP Enzymes : Moxidectin is not a substrate or inhibitor of CYP enzymes .
Uridine 5 ' - diphospho - glucuronosyltransferases ( UGTs ) : Moxidectin is not a UGT substrate .
Transporter Systems : Moxidectin is not a substrate of P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) nor breast cancer resistance protein 1 ( BCRP1 ) .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which moxidectin exhibits its effect against O . volvulus is not known .
Studies with other nematodes suggest that moxidectin binds to glutamate - gated chloride channels ( GluCl ) , gamma - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) receptors and / or ATP - binding cassette ( ABC ) transporters .
This leads to increased permeability , influx of chloride ions , hyperpolarization and muscle paralysis .
Additionally , there is a reduction in motility of all stages of the parasite , excretion of immunomodulatory proteins , and the fertility of both male and female adult worms .
Antimicrobial activity Moxidectin is active against the microfilariae of O . volvulus [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Studies suggest that moxidectin is not effective in killing the adult worms , however , it inhibits intra - uterine embryogenesis and release of microfilariae from the adult worms .
Resistance Studies in vitro and ininfected animals suggest a potential for development of resistance to moxidectin and cross - resistance with other macrocyclic lactones , such as ivermectin .
However , the clinical relevance of these findings is not known .
The mechanism of resistance may be multifactorial that include alteration in the target GluCl , GABA receptors and / or ABC transporters .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Two - year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats were conducted with moxidectin .
Mice were administered a mean dietary dose of 8 . 7 mg / kg / day moxidectin which is approximately equivalent to 5 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area comparison .
Rats were administered a mean dietary dose of 6 . 1 mg / kg / day moxidectin which is approximately equivalent to 7 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area comparison .
There was no evidence of tumorigenicity in either study .
Mutagenesis Moxidectin was shown to be negative for genotoxicity in a battery of in vitro assays including a bacterial mutagenicity assay , mouse lymphoma cell mutagenicity assay , unscheduled DNA synthesis assay , and a chromosome aberration assay , as well as in vivo in a micronucleus assay in mice and a chromosome aberration assay in rats .
Impairment of Fertility In fertility evaluations , male and female mating and fertility indices were not inhibited by oral - dietary moxidectin doses of approximately 0 . 86 mg / kg / day which is approximately equivalent to the recommended human dose based on body surface area comparison .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Moxidectin was associated with transient CNS - related clinical signs .
In rats , a single dose of 20 mg / kg ( equivalent to approximately 24 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area comparison ) moxidectin was associated with piloerection , reduced arousal and body tone , abnormal gait , slowed breathing , and impaired righting reflex .
In dogs , repeated doses of 1 . 6 mg / kg / day moxidectin ( equivalent to approximately 7 times the recommended human dose based on body surface area comparison ) was associated with lacrimation , languid appearance , tremors , slight salivation , and slight ataxia .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The assessment of the safety and efficacy of Moxidectin Tablets 8 mg in the treatment of onchocerciasis is based on data from two randomized , double - blind , active - controlled trials in patients with O . volvulus infection , Trial 1 in 1472 patients ( NCT 00790998 ) , and Trial 2 , a dose - ranging trial ( NCT 00300768 ) .
Patients in the trials received a single oral dose of moxidectin or ivermectin , the active control medication .
Efficacy was assessed by skin microfilarial density ( microfilariae / mg skin ) from the mean of 4 skin snips per person per time point up to 18 months post - treatment .
Trial 1 recruited adult and adolescent patients ≥ 12 years with a body weight ≥ 30 kg and ≥ 10 microfilariae / mg skin .
Mean ( ± SD ) age was 42 . 5 ( ± 16 . 3 ) years , height 1 . 59 ( ± 0 . 09 ) meters , weight 51 . 6 ( ± 8 . 2 ) kg ; 36 . 1 % were female and 100 % were black .
Mean ( ± SD ) pretreatment skin microfilarial density was 39 . 5 ( ± 30 . 7 ) microfilariae / mg skin , 69 . 6 % had ≥ 20 microfilariae / mg skin and 39 . 7 % had at least one ocular microfilaria .
Patients who were not previously exposed to ivermectin community directed treatment programs were recruited from the sub - Saharan African region ( Democratic Republic of Congo , Liberia , and Ghana ) .
Table 5 reports mean skin microfilarial density and the proportion of patients with undetectable skin microfilariae at Months 1 , 6 , and 12 .

b Proportion of subjects undetectable ( defined as a mean skin microfilariae density of zero across all 4 skin snips ) .
Additionally , safety and efficacy was assessed in a smaller single ascending dose trial ( Trial 2 , NCT 00300768 ) comparing 2 mg ( n = 44 ) , 4 mg ( n = 45 ) ( 2 mg and 4 mg are not approved doses ) and 8 mg ( n = 38 ) single doses of moxidectin to ivermectin .
Trial 2 was conducted in Ghana in adults aged ≥ 18 to ≤ 60 years with O . volvulus infection .
Analysis of the baseline - to - 12 - month change in skin microfilarial density for the proposed moxidectin 8 mg dose showed statistically significant superiority to ivermectin , p < 0 . 001 .
