3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS • Tablets : 400 mg ( 3 . 1 ) 3 . 1 Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride Tablets • Containing moxifloxacin hydrochloride ( equivalent to 400 mg moxifloxacin ) • Modified capsule shaped , dull red film - coated tablets • Debossed with E - 18 on one side and plain on the other side 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Moxifloxacin hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in persons with a history of hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin or any member of the quinolone class of antimicrobial agents .
Known hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin hydrochloride tablets or other quinolones .
( 4 , 5 . 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture .
This risk is further increased in older patients usually over 60 years of age , in patients taking corticosteroids , and in patients with kidney , heart or lung transplants .
Discontinue if pain or inflammation in a tendon occurs .
( 5 . 1 , 8 . 5 ) • Prolongation of the QT interval and isolated cases of torsade de pointes has been reported .
Avoid use in patients with known prolongation , hypokalemia , and with drugs that prolong the QT interval .
( 5 . 3 , 7 . 5 , 8 . 5 ) .
Use caution in patients with proarrhythmic conditions such as clinically significant bradycardia or acute myocardial ischemia .
( 5 . 3 ) • Serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylactic reactions , may occur after first or subsequent doses .
Discontinue drug use at first sign of skin rash , jaundice or any other sign of hypersensitivity .
( 5 . 4 , 5 . 5 ) • Central nervous system ( CNS ) events including dizziness , confusion , hallucination , depression , and rarely suicidal thoughts or acts may occur after first dose .
Use caution in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold .
( 5 . 6 ) • Clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea : Evaluate if diarrhea occurs .
( 5 . 7 ) • Peripheral neuropathy : Discontinue if symptoms occur .
( 5 . 8 ) 5 . 1 Tendinopathy and Tendon Rupture Fluoroquinolones , including moxifloxacin hydrochloride , are associated with an increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture in all ages .
This adverse reaction most frequently involves the Achilles tendon , and rupture of the Achilles tendon may require surgical repair .
Tendinitis and tendon rupture in the rotator cuff ( the shoulder ) , the hand , the biceps , the thumb , and other tendon sites have also been reported .
The risk of developing fluoroquinolone - associated tendinitis and tendon rupture is further increased in older patients usually over 60 years of age , in patients taking corticosteroid drugs , and in patients with kidney , heart or lung transplants .
Factors , in addition to age and corticosteroid use , that may independently increase the risk of tendon rupture include strenuous physical activity , renal failure , and previous tendon disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis .
Tendinitis and tendon rupture have also occurred in patients taking fluoroquinolones who do not have the above risk factors .
Tendon rupture can occur during or after completion of therapy ; cases occurring up to several months after completion of therapy have been reported .
Moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be discontinued if the patient experiences pain , swelling , inflammation or rupture of a tendon .
Patients should be advised to rest at the first sign of tendinitis or tendon rupture , and to contact their healthcare provider regarding changing to a non - quinolone antimicrobial drug .
[ See Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 4 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) . ]
5 . 2 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis Fluoroquinolones , including moxifloxacin hydrochloride , have neuromuscular blocking activity and may exacerbate muscle weakness in persons with myasthenia gravis .
Postmarketing serious adverse events , including deaths and requirement for ventilatory support , have been associated with fluoroquinolone use in persons with myasthenia gravis .
Avoid moxifloxacin hydrochloride in patients with known history of myasthenia gravis [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 3 QT Prolongation Moxifloxacin hydrochloride has been shown to prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients .
Following oral dosing with 400 mg of moxifloxacin the mean ( ± SD ) change in QTc from the pre - dose value at the time of maximum drug concentration was 6 msec ( ± 26 ) ( n = 787 ) .
Following a course of daily intravenous dosing ( 400 mg ; 1 hour infusion each day ) the mean change in QTc from the Day 1 pre - dose value was 10 msec ( ± 22 ) on Day 1 ( n = 667 ) and 7 msec ( ± 24 ) on Day 3 ( n = 667 ) .
The drug should be avoided in patients with known prolongation of the QT interval , patients with uncorrected hypokalemia and patients receiving Class IA ( for example , quinidine , procainamide ) or Class III ( for example , amiodarone , sotalol ) antiarrhythmic agents , due to the lack of clinical experience with the drug in these patient populations .
Pharmacokinetic studies between moxifloxacin hydrochloride and other drugs that prolong the QT interval such as cisapride , erythromycin , antipsychotics , and tricyclic antidepressants have not been performed .
An additive effect of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and these drugs cannot be excluded ; therefore caution should be exercised when moxifloxacin hydrochloride is given concurrently with these drugs .
In premarketing clinical trials , the rate of cardiovascular adverse events was similar in 798 moxifloxacin hydrochloride and 702 comparator treated patients who received concomitant therapy with drugs known to prolong the QTc interval .
Moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with ongoing proarrhythmic conditions , such as clinically significant bradycardia , acute myocardial ischemia .
The magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of the drug or increasing rates of infusion of the intravenous formulation .
Therefore the recommended dose or infusion rate should not be exceeded .
QT prolongation may lead to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias including torsade de pointes .
No excess in cardiovascular morbidity or mortality attributable to QTc prolongation occurred with moxifloxacin hydrochloride treatment in over 15 , 500 patients in controlled clinical studies , including 759 patients who were hypokalemic at the start of treatment , and there was no increase in mortality in over 18 , 000 moxifloxacin hydrochloride tablet treated patients in a postmarketing observational study in which ECGs were not performed .
Elderly patients using IV moxifloxacin hydrochloride may be more susceptible to drug - associated QT prolongation [ see Use In Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
In addition , moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with mild , moderate , or severe liver cirrhosis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious anaphylactic reactions , some following the first dose , have been reported in patients receiving quinolone therapy , including moxifloxacin hydrochloride .
Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse , loss of consciousness , tingling , pharyngeal or facial edema , dyspnea , urticaria , and itching .
Serious anaphylactic reactions require immediate emergency treatment with epinephrine .
Moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be discontinued at the first appearance of a skin rash or any other sign of hypersensitivity .
Oxygen , intravenous steroids , and airway management , including intubation , may be administered as indicated .
[ See Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) . ]
5 . 5 Other Serious and Sometimes Fatal Reactions Other serious and sometimes fatal events , some due to hypersensitivity , and some due to uncertain etiology , have been reported rarely in patients receiving therapy with quinolones , including moxifloxacin hydrochloride .
These events may be severe and generally occur following the administration of multiple doses .
Clinical manifestations may include one or more of the following : • Fever , rash , or severe dermatologic reactions ( for example , toxic epidermal necrolysis , Stevens - Johnson syndrome ) • Vasculitis ; arthralgia ; myalgia ; serum sickness • Allergic pneumonitis • Interstitial nephritis ; acute renal insufficiency or failure • Hepatitis ; jaundice ; acute hepatic necrosis or failure • Anemia , including hemolytic and aplastic ; thrombocytopenia , including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ; leukopenia ; agranulocytosis ; pancytopenia ; and / or other hematologic abnormalities The drug should be discontinued immediately at the first appearance of a skin rash , jaundice , or any other sign of hypersensitivity and supportive measures instituted [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 6 Central Nervous System Effects Fluoroquinolones , including moxifloxacin hydrochloride , may cause central nervous system ( CNS ) events , including : nervousness , agitation , insomnia , anxiety , nightmares or paranoia .
[ See Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 , 6 . 4 ) . ]
Convulsions and increased intracranial pressure ( including pseudotumor cerebri ) have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones .
Fluoroquinolones may also cause central nervous system ( CNS ) events including : dizziness , confusion , tremors , hallucinations , depression , and , rarely , suicidal thoughts or acts .
These reactions may occur following the first dose .
If these reactions occur in patients receiving moxifloxacin hydrochloride , the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures instituted .
As with all fluoroquinolones , moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected CNS disorders ( for example , severe cerebral arteriosclerosis , epilepsy ) or in the presence of other risk factors that may predispose to seizures or lower the seizure threshold .
[ See Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 , 6 . 4 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) . ]
5 . 7 Clostridium Difficile - Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including moxifloxacin hydrochloride , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibiotic treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 8 Peripheral Neuropathy Cases of sensory or sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy affecting small and / or large axons resulting in paresthesias , hypoesthesias , dysesthesias and weakness have been reported in patients receiving fluoroquinolones including moxifloxacin hydrochloride .
Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of moxifloxacin hydrochloride and may be irreversible .
Moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be discontinued immediately if the patient experiences symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain , burning , tingling , numbness , and / or weakness or other alterations of sensation including light touch , pain , temperature , position sense , and vibratory sensation [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 , 6 . 4 ) and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 9 Arthropathic Effects in Animals The oral administration of moxifloxacin hydrochloride caused lameness in immature dogs .
Histopathological examination of the weight - bearing joints of these dogs revealed permanent lesions of the cartilage .
Related quinolone - class drugs also produce erosions of cartilage of weight - bearing joints and other signs of arthropathy in immature animals of various species .
[ see Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology ( 13 . 2 ) . ]
5 . 10 Blood Glucose Disturbances As with all fluoroquinolones , disturbances in blood glucose , including hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia have been reported with moxifloxacin hydrochloride .
In moxifloxacin hydrochloride - treated patients , dysglycemia occurred predominantly in elderly diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent ( for example , sulfonylurea ) or with insulin .
In diabetic patients , careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs , moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be initiated immediately As with all fluoroquinolones , disturbances in blood glucose , including both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia have been reported with moxifloxacin hydrochloride .
In moxifloxacin hydrochloride - treated patients , dysglycemia occurred predominantly in elderly diabetic patients receiving concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent ( for example , sulfonylurea ) or with insulin .
In diabetic patients , careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs , moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be initiated immediately .
[ See Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) . ]
5 . 11 Photosensitivity / Phototoxicity Moderate to severe photosensitivity / phototoxicity reactions , the latter of which may manifest as exaggerated sunburn reactions ( for example , burning , erythema , exudation , vesicles , blistering , edema ) involving areas exposed to light ( typically the face , “ V ” area of the neck , extensor surfaces of the forearms , dorsa of the hands ) , can be associated with the use of quinolone antibiotics after sun or UV light exposure .
Therefore , excessive exposure to these sources of light should be avoided .
Drug therapy should be discontinued if phototoxicity occurs .
[ See Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 4 ) and Pharmacokinetics ( 12 . 3 ) . ]
5 . 12 Development of Drug Resistant Bacteria Prescribing moxifloxacin hydrochloride in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common reactions ( ≥ 3 % ) were nausea , diarrhea , headache , and dizziness .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Interacting Drug Interaction Antacids , sucralfate , multivitamins , and other products containing multivalent cations Moxifloxacin absorption is decreased .
Administer moxifloxacin hydrochloride tablet at least 4 hours before or 8 hours after these products .
( 2 . 2 , 7 . 1 , 12 . 3 , 17 ) Warfarin Anticoagulant effect of warfarin may be enhanced .
Monitor prothrombin time / INR , watch for bleeding .
( 6 . 4 , 7 . 2 , 12 . 3 ) Class IA and Class III antiarrhythmics : Proarrhythmic effect may be enhanced .
Avoid concomitant use .
( 5 . 3 , 7 . 5 ) Antidiabetic agents Carefully monitor blood glucose ( 5 . 10 , 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Antacids , Sucralfate , Multivitamins and Other Products Containing Multivalent Cations Quinolones form chelates with alkaline earth and transition metal cations .
Oral administration of quinolones with antacids containing aluminum or magnesium , with sucralfate , with metal cations such as iron , or with multivitamins containing iron or zinc , or with formulations containing divalent and trivalent cations such as VIDEX ® ( didanosine ) chewable / buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution , may substantially interfere with the absorption of quinolones , resulting in systemic concentrations considerably lower than desired .
Therefore , moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be taken at least 4 hours before or 8 hours after these agents .
[ See Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Pharmacokinetics ( 12 . 3 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) . ]
7 . 2 Warfarin Quinolones , including moxifloxacin hydrochloride , have been reported to enhance the anticoagulant effects of warfarin or its derivatives in the patient population .
In addition , infectious disease and its accompanying inflammatory process , age , and general status of the patient are risk factors for increased anticoagulant activity .
Therefore the prothrombin time , International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) , or other suitable anticoagulation tests should be closely monitored if a quinolone is administered concomitantly with warfarin or its derivatives .
[ See Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 , 6 . 3 ) , Pharmacokinetics ( 12 . 3 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) . ]
7 . 3 Antidiabetic Agents Disturbances of blood glucose , including hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia , have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with fluoroquinolones and an antidiabetic agent .
Therefore , careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are co - administered .
If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs , moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be initiated immediately .

7 . 4 Nonsteroidal Anti - Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) Although not observed with moxifloxacin hydrochloride in preclinical and clinical trials , the concomitant administration of a nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug with a quinolone may increase the risks of CNS stimulation and convulsions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
7 . 5 Drugs that Prolong QT There is limited information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction in humans between moxifloxacin hydrochloride and other drugs that prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram .
Sotalol , a Class III antiarrhythmic , has been shown to further increase the QTc interval when combined with high doses of intravenous ( IV ) moxifloxacin in dogs .
Therefore , moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be avoided with Class IA and Class III antiarrhythmics .
[ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 2 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) . ]
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Based on animal data may cause fetal harm .
( 8 . 1 ) • Geriatrics : Increased risk for severe tendon disorders further increased by concomitant corticosteroid therapy and increased risk of prolongation of the QT interval .
( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 , 8 . 5 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C . Because no adequate or well - controlled studies have been conducted in pregnant women , moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Moxifloxacin was not teratogenic when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at oral doses as high as 500 mg / kg / day or 0 . 24 times the maximum recommended human dose based on systemic exposure ( AUC ) , but decreased fetal body weights and slightly delayed fetal skeletal development ( indicative of fetotoxicity ) were observed .
Intravenous administration of 80 mg / kg / day ( approximately 2 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area ( mg / m 2 ) to pregnant rats resulted in maternal toxicity and a marginal effect on fetal and placental weights and the appearance of the placenta .
There was no evidence of teratogenicity at intravenous doses as high as 80 mg / kg / day .
Intravenous administration of 20 mg / kg / day ( approximately equal to the maximum recommended human oral dose based upon systemic exposure ) to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weights and delayed fetal skeletal ossification .
When rib and vertebral malformations were combined , there was an increased fetal and litter incidence of these effects .
Signs of maternal toxicity in rabbits at this dose included mortality , abortions , marked reduction of food consumption , decreased water intake , body weight loss and hypoactivity .
There was no evidence of teratogenicity when pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were given oral doses as high as 100 mg / kg / day ( 2 . 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based upon systemic exposure ) .
An increased incidence of smaller fetuses was observed at 100 mg / kg / day .
In an oral pre - and postnatal development study conducted in rats , effects observed at 500 mg / kg / day included slight increases in duration of pregnancy and prenatal loss , reduced pup birth weight and decreased neonatal survival .
Treatment - related maternal mortality occurred during gestation at 500 mg / kg / day in this study .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Moxifloxacin is excreted in the breast milk of rats .
Moxifloxacin may also be excreted in human milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in infants who are nursing from mothers taking moxifloxacin hydrochloride , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients and adolescents less than 18 years of age have not been established .
Moxifloxacin hydrochloride causes arthropathy in juvenile animals [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Geriatric patients are at increased risk for developing severe tendon disorders including tendon rupture when being treated with a fluoroquinolone such as moxifloxacin hydrochloride .
This risk is further increased in patients receiving concomitant corticosteroid therapy .
Tendinitis or tendon rupture can involve the Achilles , hand , shoulder , or other tendon sites and can occur during or after completion of therapy ; cases occurring up to several months after fluoroquinolone treatment have been reported .
Caution should be used when prescribing moxifloxacin hydrochloride to elderly patients especially those on corticosteroids .
Patients should be informed of this potential side effect and advised to discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride and contact their healthcare provider if any symptoms of tendinitis or tendon rupture occur [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 4 ) ] .
In controlled multiple - dose clinical trials , 23 % of patients receiving oral moxifloxacin hydrochloride were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 9 % were greater than or equal to 75 years of age .
The clinical trial data demonstrate that there is no difference in the safety and efficacy of oral moxifloxacin hydrochloride in patients aged 65 or older compared to younger adults .
In trials of intravenous use , 42 % of moxifloxacin hydrochloride patients were greater than or equal to 65 years of age , and 23 % were greater than or equal to 75 years of age .
The clinical trial data demonstrate that the safety of intravenous moxifloxacin hydrochloride in patients aged 65 or older was similar to that of comparator - treated patients .
In general , elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug - associated effects of the QT interval .
Therefore , moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be avoided in patients taking drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval ( for example , class IA or class III antiarrhythmics ) or in patients with risk factors for torsade de pointes ( for example , known QT prolongation , uncorrected hypokalemia ) .
[ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 5 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) . ]
8 . 6 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetic parameters of moxifloxacin are not significantly altered in mild , moderate , severe , or end - stage renal disease .
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment , including those patients requiring hemodialysis ( HD ) or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) .
[ See Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) . ]
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment is recommended for mild , moderate , or severe hepatic insufficiency ( Child - Pugh Classes A , B , or C ) .
However , due to metabolic disturbances associated with hepatic insufficiency , which may lead to QT prolongation , moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Single oral overdoses up to 2 . 8 g were not associated with any serious adverse events .
In the event of acute overdose , the stomach should be emptied and adequate hydration maintained .
ECG monitoring is recommended due to the possibility of QT interval prolongation .
The patient should be carefully observed and given supportive treatment .
The administration of activated charcoal as soon as possible after oral overdose may prevent excessive increase of systemic moxifloxacin exposure .
About 3 % and 9 % of the dose of moxifloxacin , as well as about 2 % and 4 . 5 % of its glucuronide metabolite are removed by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis , respectively .
Single oral moxifloxacin doses of 2000 , 500 , and 1500 mg / kg were lethal to rats , mice , and cynomolgus monkeys , respectively .
The minimum lethal intravenous dose in mice and rats was 100 mg / kg .
Adverse clinical signs included CNS and gastrointestinal effects such as decreased activity , somnolence , tremor , convulsions , vomiting and diarrhea .
11 DESCRIPTION Moxifloxacin hydrochloride is a synthetic broad spectrum antibacterial agent for oral administration .
Moxifloxacin , a fluoroquinolone , is available as the monohydrochloride salt of 1 - cyclopropyl - 7 - [ ( S , S ) - 2 , 8 - diazabicyclo [ 4 . 3 . 0 ] non - 8 - yl ] - 6 - fluoro - 8 - methoxy - 1 , 4 - dihydro - 4 - oxo - 3 quinoline carboxylic acid .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Moxifloxacin hydrochloride is a member of the fluoroquinolone class of antibacterial agents [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Moxifloxacin , given as an oral tablet , is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract .
The absolute bioavailability of moxifloxacin is approximately 90 percent .
Co - administration with a high fat meal ( that is , 500 calories from fat ) does not affect the absorption of moxifloxacin .
Consumption of 1 cup of yogurt with moxifloxacin does not significantly affect the extent or rate of systemic absorption ( AUC ) .

The mean ( ± SD ) elimination half - life from plasma is 12 ± 1 . 3 hours ; steady - state is achieved after at least three days with a 400 mg once daily regimen .
Mean Steady - State Plasma Concentrations of Moxifloxacin Obtained With Once Daily Dosing of 400 mg Either Orally ( n = 10 ) or by IV Infusion ( n = 12 ) [ MULTIMEDIA ] Distribution Moxifloxacin is approximately 30 to 50 % bound to serum proteins , independent of drug concentration .
The volume of distribution of moxifloxacin ranges from 1 . 7 to 2 . 7 L / kg .
Moxifloxacin is widely distributed throughout the body , with tissue concentrations often exceeding plasma concentrations .
Moxifloxacin has been detected in the saliva , nasal and bronchial secretions , mucosa of the sinuses , skin blister fluid , subcutaneous tissue , skeletal muscle , and abdominal tissues and fluids following oral or intravenous administration of 400 mg .
Moxifloxacin concentrations measured post - dose in various tissues and fluids following a 400 mg oral or IV dose are summarized in Table 7 .
The rates of elimination of moxifloxacin from tissues generally parallel the elimination from plasma .
Table 7 : Moxifloxacin Concentrations ( mean ± SD ) in Tissues and the Corresponding Plasma Concentrations After a Single 400 mg Oral or Intravenous Dose aa ) All moxifloxacin concentrations were measured 3 hours after a single 400 mg dose , except the abdominal tissue and exudate concentrations which were measured at 2 hours post - dose and the sinus concentrations which were measured 3 hours post - dose after 5 days of dosing .

The cytochrome P450 system is not involved in moxifloxacin metabolism , and is not affected by moxifloxacin .
The sulfate conjugate ( M1 ) accounts for approximately 38 % of the dose , and is eliminated primarily in the feces .
Approximately 14 % of an oral or intravenous dose is converted to a glucuronide conjugate ( M2 ) , which is excreted exclusively in the urine .
Peak plasma concentrations of M2 are approximately 40 % those of the parent drug , while plasma concentrations of M1 are generally less than 10 % those of moxifloxacin .
In vitro studies with cytochrome ( CYP ) P450 enzymes indicate that moxifloxacin does not inhibit CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , or CYP1A2 , suggesting that moxifloxacin is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by these enzymes .
Excretion Approximately 45 % of an oral or intravenous dose of moxifloxacin is excreted as unchanged drug ( ~ 20 % in urine and ~ 25 % in feces ) .
A total of 96 % ± 4 % of an oral dose is excreted as either unchanged drug or known metabolites .
The mean ( ± SD ) apparent total body clearance and renal clearance are 12 ± 2 L / hr and 2 . 6 ± 0 . 5 L / hr , respectively .
Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Geriatric Following oral administration of 400 mg moxifloxacin for 10 days in 16 elderly ( 8 male ; 8 female ) and 17 young ( 8 male ; 9 female ) healthy volunteers , there were no age - related changes in moxifloxacin pharmacokinetics .
In 16 healthy male volunteers ( 8 young ; 8 elderly ) given a single 200 mg dose of oral moxifloxacin , the extent of systemic exposure ( AUC and C max ) was not statistically different between young and elderly males and elimination half - life was unchanged .
No dosage adjustment is necessary based on age .
In large phase III studies , the concentrations around the time of the end of the infusion in elderly patients following intravenous infusion of 400 mg were similar to those observed in young patients .
[ see Use In Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) . ]
Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin in pediatric subjects has not been studied [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Gender Following oral administration of 400 mg moxifloxacin daily for 10 days to 23 healthy males ( 19 to 75 years ) and 24 healthy females ( 19 to 70 years ) , the mean AUC and C max were 8 % and 16 % higher , respectively , in females compared to males .
There are no significant differences in moxifloxacin pharmacokinetics between male and female subjects when differences in body weight are taken into consideration .
A 400 mg single dose study was conducted in 18 young males and females .
The comparison of moxifloxacin pharmacokinetics in this study ( 9 young females and 9 young males ) showed no differences in AUC or C max due to gender .
Dosage adjustments based on gender are not necessary .
Race Steady - state moxifloxacin pharmacokinetics in male Japanese subjects were similar to those determined in Caucasians , with a mean C max of 4 . 1 mcg / mL , an AUC 24 of 47 mcg • h / mL , and an elimination half - life of 14 hours , following 400 mg p . o . daily .
Renal Insufficiency The pharmacokinetic parameters of moxifloxacin are not significantly altered in mild , moderate , severe , or end - stage renal disease .
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment , including those patients requiring hemodialysis ( HD ) or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) .
In a single oral dose study of 24 patients with varying degrees of renal function from normal to severely impaired , the mean peak concentrations ( C max ) of moxifloxacin were reduced by 21 % and 28 % in the patients with moderate ( CL CR ≥ 30 and ≤ 60 mL / min ) and severe ( CL CR < 30 mL / min ) renal impairment , respectively .
The mean systemic exposure ( AUC ) in these patients was increased by 13 % .
In the moderate and severe renally impaired patients , the mean AUC for the sulfate conjugate ( M1 ) increased by 1 . 7 - fold ( ranging up to 2 . 8 - fold ) and mean AUC and C max for the glucuronide conjugate ( M2 ) increased by 2 . 8 - fold ( ranging up to 4 . 8 - fold ) and 1 . 4 - fold ( ranging up to 2 . 5 - fold ) , respectively .
[ See Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) . ]
The pharmacokinetics of single dose and multiple dose moxifloxacin were studied in patients with CL CR < 20 mL / min on either hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( 8 HD , 8 CAPD ) .
Following a single 400 mg oral dose , the AUC of moxifloxacin in these HD and CAPD patients did not vary significantly from the AUC generally found in healthy volunteers .
C max values of moxifloxacin were reduced by about 45 % and 33 % in HD and CAPD patients , respectively , compared to healthy , historical controls .
The exposure ( AUC ) to the sulfate conjugate ( M1 ) increased by 1 . 4 - to 1 . 5 - fold in these patients .
The mean AUC of the glucuronide conjugate ( M2 ) increased by a factor of 7 . 5 , whereas the mean C max values of the glucuronide conjugate ( M2 ) increased by a factor of 2 . 5 to 3 , compared to healthy subjects .
The sulfate and the glucuronide conjugates of moxifloxacin are not microbiologically active , and the clinical implication of increased exposure to these metabolites in patients with renal disease including those undergoing HD and CAPD has not been studied .
Oral administration of 400 mg QD moxifloxacin for 7 days to patients on HD or CAPD produced mean systemic exposure ( AUC ss ) to moxifloxacin similar to that generally seen in healthy volunteers .
Steady - state C max values were about 22 % lower in HD patients but were comparable between CAPD patients and healthy volunteers .
Both HD and CAPD removed only small amounts of moxifloxacin from the body ( approximately 9 % by HD , and 3 % by CAPD ) .
HD and CAPD also removed about 4 % and 2 % of the glucuronide metabolite ( M2 ) , respectively .
Hepatic Insufficiency No dosage adjustment is recommended for mild , moderate , or severe hepatic insufficiency ( Child - Pugh Classes A , B , or C ) .
However , due to metabolic disturbances associated with hepatic insufficiency , which may lead to QT prolongation , moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be used with caution in these patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
In 400 mg single oral dose studies in 6 patients with mild ( Child - Pugh Class A ) and 10 patients with moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B ) hepatic insufficiency , moxifloxacin mean systemic exposure ( AUC ) was 78 % and 102 % , respectively , of 18 healthy controls and mean peak concentration ( C max ) was 79 % and 84 % of controls .
The mean AUC of the sulfate conjugate of moxifloxacin ( M1 ) increased by 3 . 9 - fold ( ranging up to 5 . 9 - fold ) and 5 . 7 - fold ( ranging up to 8 - fold ) in the mild and moderate groups , respectively .
The mean C max of M1 increased by approximately 3 - fold in both groups ( ranging up to 4 . 7 - and 3 . 9 - fold ) .
The mean AUC of the glucuronide conjugate of moxifloxacin ( M2 ) increased by 1 . 5 - fold ( ranging up to 2 . 5 - fold ) in both groups .
The mean C max of M2 increased by 1 . 6 - and 1 . 3 - fold ( ranging up to 2 . 7 - and 2 . 1 - fold ) , respectively .
The clinical significance of increased exposure to the sulfate and glucuronide conjugates has not been studied .
In a subset of patients participating in a clinical trial , the plasma concentrations of moxifloxacin and metabolites determined approximately at the moxifloxacin T max following the first intravenous or oral moxifloxacin dose in the Child - Pugh Class C patients ( n = 10 ) were similar to those in the Child - Pugh Class A / B patients ( n = 5 ) , and also similar to those observed in healthy volunteer studies .
Photosensitivity Potential A study of the skin response to ultraviolet ( UVA and UVB ) and visible radiation conducted in 32 healthy volunteers ( 8 per group ) demonstrated that moxifloxacin hydrochloride does not show phototoxicity in comparison to placebo .
The minimum erythematous dose ( MED ) was measured before and after treatment with moxifloxacin ( 200 mg or 400 mg once daily ) , lomefloxacin ( 400 mg once daily ) , or placebo .
In this study , the MED measured for both doses of moxifloxacin were not significantly different from placebo , while lomefloxacin significantly lowered the MED .
It is difficult to ascribe relative photosensitivity / phototoxicity among various fluoroquinolones during actual patient use because other factors play a role in determining a subject ’ s susceptibility to this adverse event such as : a patient ’ s skin pigmentation , frequency and duration of sun and artificial ultraviolet light ( UV ) exposure , wearing of sunscreen and protective clothing , the use of other concomitant drugs and the dosage and duration of fluoroquinolone therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 3 ) , and Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
Drug - Drug Interactions The following drug interactions were studied in healthy volunteers or patients .
Antacids and iron significantly reduced bioavailability of moxifloxacin , as observed with other quinolones [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Calcium , digoxin , itraconazole , morphine , probenecid , ranitidine , theophylline and warfarin did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin .
These results and the data from in vitro studies suggest that moxifloxacin is unlikely to significantly alter the metabolic clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , or CYP1A2 enzymes .
Moxifloxacin had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of atenolol , digoxin , glyburide , itraconazole , oral contraceptives , theophylline , cyclosporine and warfarin [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Antacids When moxifloxacin ( single 400 mg tablet dose ) was administered two hours before , concomitantly , or 4 hours after an aluminum / magnesium - containing antacid ( 900 mg aluminum hydroxide and 600 mg magnesium hydroxide as a single oral dose ) to 12 healthy volunteers there was a 26 % , 60 % and 23 % reduction in the mean AUC of moxifloxacin , respectively .
Moxifloxacin should be taken at least 4 hours before or 8 hours after antacids containing magnesium or aluminum , as well as sucralfate , metal cations such as iron , and multivitamin preparations with zinc , or VIDEX ® ( didanosine ) chewable / buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution .
[ See Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) . ]
Atenolol In a crossover study involving 24 healthy volunteers ( 12 male ; 12 female ) , the mean atenolol AUC following a single oral dose of 50 mg atenolol with placebo was similar to that observed when atenolol was given concomitantly with a single 400 mg oral dose of moxifloxacin .
The mean C max of single dose atenolol decreased by about 10 % following co - administration with a single dose of moxifloxacin .
Calcium Twelve healthy volunteers were administered concomitant moxifloxacin ( single 400 mg dose ) and calcium ( single dose of 500 mg Ca + + dietary supplement ) followed by an additional two doses of calcium 12 and 24 hours after moxifloxacin administration .
Calcium had no significant effect on the mean AUC of moxifloxacin .
The mean C max was slightly reduced and the time to maximum plasma concentration was prolonged when moxifloxacin was given with calcium compared to when moxifloxacin was given alone ( 2 . 5 hours versus 0 . 9 hours ) .
These differences are not considered to be clinically significant .
Digoxin No significant effect of moxifloxacin ( 400 mg once daily for two days ) on digoxin ( 0 . 6 mg as a single dose ) AUC was detected in a study involving 12 healthy volunteers .
The mean digoxin C max increased by about 50 % during the distribution phase of digoxin .
This transient increase in digoxin C max is not viewed to be clinically significant .
Moxifloxacin pharmacokinetics were similar in the presence or absence of digoxin .
No dosage adjustment for moxifloxacin or digoxin is required when these drugs are administered concomitantly .
Glyburide In diabetics , glyburide ( 2 . 5 mg once daily for two weeks pretreatment and for five days concurrently ) mean AUC and C max were 12 % and 21 % lower , respectively , when taken with moxifloxacin ( 400 mg once daily for five days ) in comparison to placebo .
Nonetheless , blood glucose levels were decreased slightly in patients taking glyburide and moxifloxacin in comparison to those taking glyburide alone , suggesting no interference by moxifloxacin on the activity of glyburide .
These interaction results are not viewed as clinically significant .
Iron When moxifloxacin tablets were administered concomitantly with iron ( ferrous sulfate 100 mg once daily for two days ) , the mean AUC and C max of moxifloxacin was reduced by 39 % and 59 % , respectively .
Moxifloxacin should only be taken more than 4 hours before or 8 hours after iron products .
[ See Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) . ]
Itraconazole In a study involving 11 healthy volunteers , there was no significant effect of itraconazole ( 200 mg once daily for 9 days ) , a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P4503A4 , on the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin ( a single 400 mg dose given on the 7 th day of itraconazole dosing ) .
In addition , moxifloxacin was shown not to affect the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole .
Morphine No significant effect of morphine sulfate ( a single 10 mg intramuscular dose ) on the mean AUC and C max of moxifloxacin ( 400 mg single dose ) was observed in a study of 20 healthy male and female volunteers .
Oral Contraceptives A placebo - controlled study in 29 healthy female subjects showed that moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for 7 days did not interfere with the hormonal suppression of oral contraception with 0 . 15 mg levonorgestrel / 0 . 03 mg ethinylestradiol ( as measured by serum progesterone , FSH , estradiol , and LH ) , or with the pharmacokinetics of the administered contraceptive agents .
Probenecid Probenecid ( 500 mg twice daily for two days ) did not alter the renal clearance and total amount of moxifloxacin ( 400 mg single dose ) excreted renally in a study of 12 healthy volunteers .
Ranitidine No significant effect of ranitidine ( 150 mg twice daily for three days as pretreatment ) on the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin ( 400 mg single dose ) was detected in a study involving 10 healthy volunteers .
Theophylline No significant effect of moxifloxacin ( 200 mg every twelve hours for 3 days ) on the pharmacokinetics of theophylline ( 400 mg every twelve hours for 3 days ) was detected in a study involving 12 healthy volunteers .
In addition , theophylline was not shown to affect the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin .
The effect of co - administration of a 400 mg dose of moxifloxacin with theophylline has not been studied , but it is not expected to be clinically significant based on in vitro metabolic data showing that moxifloxacin does not inhibit the CYP1A2 isoenzyme .
Warfarin No significant effect of moxifloxacin ( 400 mg once daily for eight days ) on the pharmacokinetics of R - and S - warfarin ( 25 mg single dose of warfarin sodium on the fifth day ) was detected in a study involving 24 healthy volunteers .
No significant change in prothrombin time was observed .
[ See Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) . ]
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The bactericidal action of moxifloxacin results from inhibition of the topoisomerase II ( DNA gyrase ) and topoisomerase IV required for bacterial DNA replication , transcription , repair , and recombination .
It appears that the C8 - methoxy moiety contributes to enhanced activity and lower selection of resistant mutants of Gram - positive bacteria compared to the C8 - H moiety .
The presence of the bulky bicycloamine substituent at the C - 7 position prevents active efflux , associated with the NorA or pmrA genes seen in certain Gram - positive bacteria .
Mechanism of Resistance The mechanism of action for fluoroquinolones , including moxifloxacin , is different from that of macrolides , beta - lactams , aminoglycosides , or tetracyclines ; therefore , microorganisms resistant to these classes of drugs may be susceptible to moxifloxacin .
Resistance to fluoroquinolones occurs primarily by a mutation in topoisomerase II ( DNA gyrase ) or topoisomerase IV genes , decreased outer membrane permeability or drug efflux .
In vitro resistance to moxifloxacin develops slowly via multiple - step mutations .
Resistance to moxifloxacin occurs in vitro at a general frequency of between 1 . 8 x 10 - 9 to < 1 x 10 - 11 for Gram - positive bacteria .
Cross Resistance Cross - resistance has been observed between moxifloxacin and other fluoroquinolones against Gram - negative bacteria .
Gram - positive bacteria resistant to other fluoroquinolones may , however , still be susceptible to moxifloxacin .
There is no known cross - resistance between moxifloxacin and other classes of antimicrobials .
Moxifloxacin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria , both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
Gram - positive bacteria • Enterococcus faecalis • Staphylococcus aureus • Streptococcus anginosus • Streptococcus constellatus • Streptococcus pneumoniae ( including multi - drug resistant isolates [ MDRSP ] ** ) • Streptococcus pyogenes ** MDRSP , Multi - drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae includes isolates previously known as PRSP ( Penicillin - resistant S . pneumoniae ) , and are isolates resistant to two or more of the following antibiotics : penicillin ( MIC ) ≥ 2 mcg / mL ) , 2 nd generation cephalosporins ( for example , cefuroxime ) , macrolides , tetracyclines , and trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole .
Gram - negative bacteria • Enterobacter cloacae • Escherichia coli • Haemophilus influenzae • Haemophilus parainfluenzae • Klebsiella pneumoniae • Moraxella catarrhalis • Proteus mirabilis Anaerobic bacteria • Bacteroides fragilis • Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron • Clostridium perfringens • Peptostreptococcus species Other microorganisms • Chlamydophila pneumoniae • Mycoplasma pneumoniae The following in vitro data are available , but their clinical significance is unknown .
At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for moxifloxacin .
However , the efficacy of moxifloxacin hydrochloride in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well controlled clinical trials .
Gram - positive bacteria • Staphylococcus epidermidis • Streptococcus agalactiae • Streptococcus viridans group Gram - negative bacteria • Citrobacter freundii • Klebsiella oxytoca • Legionella pneumophila Anaerobic bacteria • Fusobacterium species • Prevotella species Susceptibility Tests Methods When available , the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide the results of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drug products used in resident hospitals to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community acquired pathogens .
These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antibacterial drug product for treatment .
• Dilution Techniques : Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations ( MICs ) .
These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds .
The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure .
Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method ( broth and / or agar ) .
1 The MIC values should be interpreted according to the criteria in Table 8 .
• Diffusion Techniques : Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters can also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds .
The zone size provides an estimate of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds .
The zone size prove should be determined using a standardized test method .
2 , 3 This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 5 mcg moxifloxacin to test the susceptibility of bacteria to moxifloxacin .
The disc diffusion interpretive criteria are provided in Table 8 .
• Anaerobic Techniques : For anaerobic bacteria , the susceptibility to moxifloxacin can be determined by a standardized test method .
4 The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to the criteria provided in Table 8 .
Table 8 : Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Moxifloxacin S = Susceptible , I = Intermediate , and R = Resistant .
a ) The current absence of data on moxifloxacin - resistant isolates precludes defining any results other than “ Susceptible ” .
Isolates yielding test results ( MIC or zone diameter ) other than susceptible , should be submitted to a reference laboratory for additional testing .
MIC ( mcg / mL ) Zone Diameter ( mm ) Species S I R S I R Enterobacteriacae ≤ 2 4 ≥ 8 ≥ 19 16 – 18 ≤ 15 Enterococcus faecalis ≤ 1 2 ≥ 4 ≥ 18 15 – 17 ≤ 14 Staphylococcus aureus ≤ 2 4 ≥ 8 ≥ 19 16 – 18 ≤ 15 Haemophilus influenzae ≤ 1 a a ≥ 18 a a Haemophilus parainfluenzae ≤ 1 a a ≥ 18 a a Streptococcus pneumoniae ≤ 1 2 ≥ 4 ≥ 18 15 – 17 ≤ 14 Streptococcus species ≤ 1 2 ≥ 4 ≥ 18 15 – 17 ≤ 14 Anaerobic bacteria ≤ 2 4 ≥ 8 - - - A report of “ Susceptible ” indicates that the antimicrobial is likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentrations at the infection site necessary to inhibit growth of the pathogen .
A report of “ Intermediate ” indicates that the result should be considered equivocal , and , if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative , clinically feasible drugs , the test should be repeated .
This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where a high dosage of the drug product can be used .
This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation .
A report of “ Resistant ” indicates that the antimicrobial is not likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial compound reaches the concentrations usually achievable at the infection site ; other therapy should be selected .
• Quality Control Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay and the techniques of the individuals performing the test .
1 , 2 , 3 , 4 Standard moxifloxacin powder should provide the following range of MIC values noted in Table 9 .
For the diffusion technique using the 5 mcg moxifloxacin disk , the criteria in Table 9 should be achieved .

Moxifloxacin was not mutagenic in 4 bacterial strains ( TA 98 , TA 100 , TA 1535 , TA 1537 ) used in the Ames Salmonella reversion assay .
As with other quinolones , the positive response observed with moxifloxacin in strain TA 102 using the same assay may be due to the inhibition of DNA gyrase .
Moxifloxacin was not mutagenic in the CHO / HGPRT mammalian cell gene mutation assay .
An equivocal result was obtained in the same assay when v79 cells were used .
Moxifloxacin was clastogenic in the v79 chromosome aberration assay , but it did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in cultured rat hepatocytes .
There was no evidence of genotoxicity in vivo in a micronucleus test or a dominant lethal test in mice .
Moxifloxacin had no effect on fertility in male and female rats at oral doses as high as 500 mg / kg / day , approximately 12 times the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area ( mg / m 2 ) , or at intravenous doses as high as 45 mg / kg / day , approximately equal to the maximum recommended human dose based on body surface area ( mg / m 2 ) .
At 500 mg / kg orally there were slight effects on sperm morphology ( head - tail separation ) in male rats and on the estrous cycle in female rats .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Quinolones have been shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals .
In studies in juvenile dogs oral doses of moxifloxacin ≥ 30 mg / kg / day ( approximately 1 . 5 times the maximum recommended human dose based upon systemic exposure ) for 28 days resulted in arthropathy .
There was no evidence of arthropathy in mature monkeys and rats at oral doses up to 135 and 500 mg / kg / day , respectively .
Moxifloxacin at an oral dose of 300 mg / kg did not show an increase in acute toxicity or potential for CNS toxicity ( for example , seizures ) in mice when used in combination with NSAIDs such as diclofenac , ibuprofen , or fenbufen .
Some quinolones have been reported to have proconvulsant activity that is exacerbated with concomitant use of non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) .
A QT - prolonging effect of moxifloxacin was found in dog studies , at plasma concentrations about five times the human therapeutic level .
The combined infusion of sotalol , a Class III antiarrhythmic agent , with moxifloxacin induced a higher degree of QTc prolongation in dogs than that induced by the same dose ( 30 mg / kg ) of moxifloxacin alone .
Electrophysiological in vitro studies suggested an inhibition of the rapid activating component of the delayed rectifier potassium current ( I Kr ) as an underlying mechanism .
No signs of local intolerability were observed in dogs when moxifloxacin was administered intravenously .
After intra arterial injection , inflammatory changes involving the peri - arterial soft tissue were observed suggesting that intra - arterial administration of moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be avoided .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis Moxifloxacin hydrochloride tablets ( 400 mg once daily for five days ) were evaluated for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis in a randomized , double - blind , controlled clinical trial conducted in the U .

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION See FDA - Approved Medication Guide Antibacterial Resistance Antibacterial drugs including moxifloxacin hydrochloride should only be used to treat bacterial infections .
They do not treat viral infections ( for example , the common cold ) .
When moxifloxacin hydrochloride is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection , patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy , the medication should be taken exactly as directed .
Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may ( 1 ) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and ( 2 ) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by moxifloxacin hydrochloride or other antibacterial drugs in the future .
Administration With Food , Fluids , and Drug Products Containing Multivalent Cations Patients should be informed that moxifloxacin hydrochloride tablets may be taken with or without food .
Patients should be advised to drink fluids liberally .
Moxifloxacin hydrochloride tablets should be taken at least 4 hours before or 8 hours after multivitamins ( containing iron or zinc ) , antacids ( containing magnesium or aluminum ) , sucralfate , or VIDEX ® ( didanosine ) chewable / buffered tablets or the pediatric powder for oral solution .
Serious and Potentially Serious Adverse Reactions To assure safe and effective use of moxifloxacin hydrochloride , patients should be informed of the following serious adverse reactions that have been associated with moxifloxacin hydrochloride and other fluoroquinolone use : • Tendon Disorders : Patients should contact their healthcare provider if they experience pain , swelling , or inflammation of a tendon , or weakness or inability to use one of their joints ; rest and refrain from exercise ; and discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride treatment .
The risk of severe tendon disorder with fluoroquinolones is higher in older patients usually over 60 years of age , in patients taking corticosteroid drugs , and in patients with kidney , heart or lung transplants .
• Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis : Fluoroquinolones like moxifloxacin hydrochloride may cause worsening of myasthenia gravis symptoms , including muscle weakness and breathing problems .
Patients should call their healthcare provider right away if they have any worsening muscle weakness or breathing problems .
• Prolongation of the QT interval : Moxifloxacin hydrochloride may produce changes in the electrocardiogram ( QTc interval prolongation ) .
Moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be avoided in patients receiving Class IA ( for example quinidine , procainamide ) or Class III ( for example amiodarone , sotalol ) antiarrhythmic agents .
Moxifloxacin hydrochloride may add to the QTc prolonging effects of other drugs such as cisapride , erythromycin , antipsychotics , and tricyclic antidepressants .
The patients should inform their physician of any personal or family history of QTc prolongation or proarrhythmic conditions such as recent hypokalemia , significant bradycardia , and acute myocardial ischemia .
Patients should contact their physician if they experience palpitations or fainting spells while taking moxifloxacin hydrochloride .
• Hypersensitivity Reactions : Patients should be advised that moxifloxacin hydrochloride may be associated with hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylactic reactions , even following a single dose .
Patients should discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride at the first sign of a skin rash or other signs of an allergic reaction .
• Convulsions : Convulsions have been reported in patients receiving quinolones , and they should notify their physician before taking moxifloxacin hydrochloride if there is a history of this condition .
Patients should also inform their physician if they are taking NSAIDs concurrently with moxifloxacin hydrochloride .
• Neurologic Adverse Effects ( for example , dizziness , lightheadedness ) : Moxifloxacin hydrochloride may cause dizziness , lightheadedness , and vision disorders ; therefore , patients should know how they react to this drug before they operate an automobile or machinery or engage in activities requiring mental alertness or coordination .
• Psychotic Reaction : Psychotic reactions sometimes resulting in self - injurious behavior have been reported in patients receiving quinolones .
Patients should notify their physician if they have a history of psychiatric illness before taking moxifloxacin hydrochloride .
• Peripheral Neuropathies : Patients should be informed that peripheral neuropathy has been associated with moxifloxacin hydrochloride use .
Symptoms may occur soon after initiation of therapy and may be irreversible .
If symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain , burning , tingling , numbness , and / or weakness develop , patients should immediately discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride and contact their physician .
• Blood Glucose Disturbances : Inform the patients that if they are diabetic and are being treated with insulin or an oral hypoglycemic agent and a hypoglycemic reaction occurs , they should discontinue moxifloxacin hydrochloride and consult a physician .
