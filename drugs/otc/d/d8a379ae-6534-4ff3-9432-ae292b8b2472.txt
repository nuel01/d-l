6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions ( ≥ 5 % and greater than placebo ) are dizziness , headache , confusion and constipation .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Upsher - Smith Laboratories , Inc . at 1 - 855 - 899 - 9180 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch 6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Memantine was evaluated in eight double - blind placebo - controlled trials involving a total of 1862 dementia ( Alzheimer ' s disease , vascular dementia ) patients ( 940 patients treated with memantine and 922 patients treated with placebo ) for a treatment period up to 28 weeks .
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation In placebo - controlled trials in which dementia patients received doses of memantine up to 20 mg / day , the likelihood of discontinuation because of an adverse reaction was the same in the memantine group ( 10 . 1 % ) as in the placebo group ( 11 . 5 % ) .
No individual adverse reaction was associated with the discontinuation of treatment in 1 % or more of memantine - treated patients and at a rate greater than placebo .
Most Common Adverse Reactions In double - blind placebo - controlled trials involving dementia patients , the most common adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 5 % and higher than placebo ) in patients treated with memantine were dizziness , headache , confusion and constipation .
Table 1 lists all adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2 % of patients treated with memantine and at an incidence greater than placebo .
Table 1 : Adverse Reactions Reported in Controlled Clinical Trials in at Least 2 % of Patients Receiving Memantine and at a Higher Frequency than Placebo - treated PatientsAdverse Reaction Placebo ( N = 922 ) % Memantine ( N = 940 ) % Body as a Whole Fatigue 1 2 Pain 1 3 Cardiovascular System Hypertension 2 4 Central and Peripheral Nervous System Dizziness 5 7 Headache 3 6 Gastrointestinal System Constipation 3 5 Vomiting 2 3 Musculoskeletal System Back pain 2 3 Psychiatric Disorders Confusion 5 6 Somnolence 2 3 Hallucination 2 3 Respiratory System Coughing 3 4 Dyspnea 1 2 The overall profile of adverse reactions and the incidence rates for individual adverse reactions in the subpopulation of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer ' s disease were not different from the profile and incidence rates described above for the overall dementia population .
Seizures Memantine has not been systematically evaluated in patients with a seizure disorder .
In clinical trials of memantine , seizures occurred in 0 . 2 % of patients treated with memantine and 0 . 5 % of patients treated with placebo .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of memantine .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
These reactions include : Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders - agranulocytosis , leukopenia ( including neutropenia ) , pancytopenia , thrombocytopenia , thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura .
Cardiac Disorders - cardiac failure congestive .
Gastrointestinal Disorders - pancreatitis .
Hepatobiliary Disorders – hepatitis .
Psychiatric Disorders - suicidal ideation .
Renal and Urinary Disorders - acute renal failure ( including increased creatinine and renal insufficiency ) .
Skin Disorders - Stevens Johnson syndrome .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Drugs that Make the Urine Alkaline The clearance of memantine was reduced by about 80 % under alkaline urine conditions at pH 8 .
Therefore , alterations of urine pH towards the alkaline condition may lead to an accumulation of the drug with a possible increase in adverse effects .
Urine pH is altered by diet , drugs ( e . g . carbonic anhydrase inhibitors , sodium bicarbonate ) and clinical state of the patient ( e . g . renal tubular acidosis or severe infections of the urinary tract ) .
Hence , memantine should be used with caution under these conditions .
7 . 2 Use with Other N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) Antagonists The combined use of memantine with other NMDA antagonists ( amantadine , ketamine , and dextromethorphan ) has not been systematically evaluated and such use should be approached with caution .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of memantine in pregnant women .
Memantine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Memantine given orally to pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis was not teratogenic up to the highest doses tested ( 18 mg / kg / day in rats and 30 mg / kg / day in rabbits , which are 9 and 30 times , respectively , the maximum recommended human dose [ MRHD ] on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Slight maternal toxicity , decreased pup weights and an increased incidence of non - ossified cervical vertebrae were seen at an oral dose of 18 mg / kg / day in a study in which rats were given oral memantine beginning pre - mating and continuing through the postpartum period .
Slight maternal toxicity and decreased pup weights were also seen at this dose in a study in which rats were treated from day 15 of gestation through the postpartum period .
The no - effect dose for these effects was 6 mg / kg , which is 3 times the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when memantine is administered to a nursing mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use The majority of people with Alzheimer ' s disease are 65 years and older .
In the clinical studies of memantine the mean age of patients was approximately 76 ; over 90 % of patients were 65 years and older , 60 % were 75 years and older , and 12 % were at or above 85 years of age .
The efficacy and safety data presented in the clinical trial sections were obtained from these patients .
There were no clinically meaningful differences in most adverse events reported by patient groups ≥ 65 years old and < 65 year old .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment .
A dosage reduction is recommended in patients with severe renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment .
Memantine Hydrochloride Tablets should be administered with caution to patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Signs and symptoms most often accompanying memantine overdosage in clinical trials and from worldwide marketing experience , alone or in combination with other drugs and / or alcohol , include agitation , asthenia , bradycardia , confusion , coma , dizziness , ECG changes , increased blood pressure , lethargy , loss of consciousness , psychosis , restlessness , slowed movement , somnolence , stupor , unsteady gait , visual hallucinations , vertigo , vomiting , and weakness .
The largest known ingestion of memantine worldwide was 2 . 0 grams in a patient who took memantine in conjunction with unspecified antidiabetic medications .
The patient experienced coma , diplopia , and agitation , but subsequently recovered .
Fatal outcome has been very rarely reported with memantine , and the relationship to memantine was unclear .
Because strategies for the management of overdose are continually evolving , it is advisable to contact a poison control center to determine the latest recommendations for the management of an overdose of any drug .
As in any cases of overdose , general supportive measures should be utilized , and treatment should be symptomatic .
Elimination of memantine can be enhanced by acidification of urine .
11 DESCRIPTION Memantine hydrochloride is an orally active NMDA receptor antagonist .
The chemical name for memantine hydrochloride is 1 - amino - 3 , 5 - dimethyladamantane hydrochloride with the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The molecular formula is C12H21N ∙ HCl and the molecular weight is 215 . 76 .
Memantine HCl occurs as a fine white to off - white powder and is soluble in water .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Persistent activation of central nervous system N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors by the excitatory amino acid glutamate has been hypothesized to contribute to the symptomatology of Alzheimer ' s disease .
Memantine is postulated to exert its therapeutic effect through its action as a low to moderate affinity uncompetitive ( open - channel ) NMDA receptor antagonist which binds preferentially to the NMDA receptor - operated cation channels .
There is no evidence that memantine prevents or slows neurodegeneration in patients with Alzheimer ' s disease .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Memantine showed low to negligible affinity for GABA , benzodiazepine , dopamine , adrenergic , histamine and glycine receptors and for voltage - dependent Ca2 + , Na + or K + channels .
Memantine also showed antagonistic effects at the 5HT3 receptor with a potency similar to that for the NMDA receptor and blocked nicotinic acetylcholine receptors with one - sixth to one - tenth the potency .
In vitro studies have shown that memantine does not affect the reversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by donepezil , galantamine , or tacrine .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following oral administration memantine is highly absorbed with peak concentrations reached in about 3 - 7 hours .
Memantine has linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range .
Food has no effect on the absorption of memantine .
Distribution The mean volume of distribution of memantine is 9 - 11 L / kg and the plasma protein binding is low ( 45 % ) .
Metabolism Memantine undergoes partial hepatic metabolism .
The hepatic microsomal CYP450 enzyme system does not play a significant role in the metabolism of memantine .
Elimination Memantine is excreted predominantly ( about 48 % ) unchanged in urine and has a terminal elimination half - life of about 60 - 80 hours .
The remainder is converted primarily to three polar metabolites which possess minimal NMDA receptor antagonistic activity : the N - glucuronide conjugate , 6 - hydroxy memantine , and 1 - nitroso - deaminated memantine .
A total of 74 % of the administered dose is excreted as the sum of the parent drug and the N - glucuronide conjugate .
Renal clearance involves active tubular secretion moderated by pH dependent tubular reabsorption .
Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Gender Following multiple dose administration of Memantine Hydrochloride Tablets 20 mg daily , females had about 45 % higher exposure than males , but there was no difference in exposure when body weight was taken into account .
Elderly The pharmacokinetics of Memantine Hydrochloride Tablets in young and elderly subjects are similar .
Renal Impairment Memantine pharmacokinetics were evaluated following single oral administration of 20 mg memantine HCl in 8 subjects with mild renal impairment ( creatinine clearance , CLcr , > 50 – 80 mL / min ) , 8 subjects with moderate renal impairment ( CLcr 30 – 49 mL / min ) , 7 subjects with severe renal impairment ( CLcr 5 – 29 mL / min ) and 8 healthy subjects ( CLcr > 80 mL / min ) matched as closely as possible by age , weight and gender to the subjects with renal impairment .
Mean AUC0 - ∞ increased by 4 % , 60 % , and 115 % in subjects with mild , moderate , and severe renal impairment , respectively , compared to healthy subjects .
The terminal elimination half - life increased by 18 % , 41 % , and 95 % in subjects with mild , moderate , and severe renal impairment , respectively , compared to healthy subjects .
No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment .
Dosage should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
Hepatic Impairment Memantine pharmacokinetics were evaluated following the administration of single oral doses of 20 mg in 8 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class B , score 7 - 9 ) and 8 subjects who were age - , gender - , and weight - matched to the hepatically - impaired subjects .
There was no change in memantine exposure ( based on Cmax and AUC ) in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment as compared with healthy subjects .
However , terminal elimination half - life increased by about 16 % in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment as compared with healthy subjects .
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment .
Memantine should be administered with caution to patients with severe hepatic impairment as the pharmacokinetics of memantine have not been evaluated in that population .
Drug - Drug Interactions Use with Cholinesterase Inhibitors Coadministration of memantine with the AChE inhibitor donepezil HCl did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either compound .
Furthermore , memantine did not affect AChE inhibition by donepezil .
In a 24 - week controlled clinical study in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer ' s disease , the adverse event profile observed with a combination of memantine and donepezil was similar to that of donepezil alone .
Effect of Memantine on the Metabolism of Other Drugs In vitro studies conducted with marker substrates of CYP450 enzymes ( CYP1A2 , - 2A6 , - 2C9 , - 2D6 , - 2E1 , - 3A4 ) showed minimal inhibition of these enzymes by memantine .
In addition , in vitro studies indicate that at concentrations exceeding those associated with efficacy , memantine does not induce the cytochrome P450 isozymes CYP1A2 , - 2C9 , - 2E1 and - 3A4 / 5 .
No pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs metabolized by these enzymes are expected .
Pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the potential of memantine for interaction with warfarin , and buproprion .
Memantine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of the CYP2B6 substrate buproprion or its metabolite hydroxybuproprion .
Furthermore , memantine did not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin as assessed by the prothrombin INR .
Effect of Other Drugs on Memantine Memantine is predominantly renally eliminated , and drugs that are substrates and / or inhibitors of the CYP450 system are not expected to alter the metabolism of memantine .
Drugs Eliminated via Renal Mechanisms Because memantine is eliminated in part by tubular secretion , coadministration of drugs that use the same renal cationic system , including hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ ) , triamterene ( TA ) , metformin , cimetidine , ranitidine , quinidine , and nicotine , could potentially result in altered plasma levels of both agents .
However , coadministration of memantine and HCTZ / TA did not affect the bioavailability of either memantine or TA , and the bioavailability of HCTZ decreased by 20 % .
In addition , coadministration of memantine with the antihyperglycemic drug Glucovance ® ( glyburide and metformin HCl ) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of memantine , metformin and glyburide .
Furthermore , memantine did not modify the serum glucose lowering effect of Glucovance ® , indicating the absence of a pharmacodynamic interaction .
Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Proteins Because the plasma protein binding of memantine is low ( 45 % ) , an interaction with drugs that are highly bound to plasma proteins , such as warfarin and digoxin , is unlikely .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in a 113 - week oral study in mice at doses up to 40 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the maximum recommended human dose [ MRHD ] on a mg / m2 basis ) .
There was also no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats orally dosed at up to 40 mg / kg / day for 71 weeks followed by 20 mg / kg / day ( 20 and 10 times the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis , respectively ) through 128 weeks .
Memantine produced no evidence of genotoxic potential when evaluated in the in vitro S . typhimurium or E . coli reverse mutation assay , an in vitro chromosomal aberration test in human lymphocytes , an in vivo cytogenetics assay for chromosome damage in rats , and the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
The results were equivocal in an in vitro gene mutation assay using Chinese hamster V79 cells .
No impairment of fertility or reproductive performance was seen in rats administered up to 18 mg / kg / day ( 9 times the MRHD on a mg / m2 basis ) orally from 14 days prior to mating through gestation and lactation in females , or for 60 days prior to mating in males .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Memantine induced neuronal lesions ( vacuolation and necrosis ) in the multipolar and pyramidal cells in cortical layers III and IV of the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial neocortices in rats , similar to those which are known to occur in rodents administered other NMDA receptor antagonists .
Lesions were seen after a single dose of memantine .
In a study in which rats were given daily oral doses of memantine for 14 days , the no - effect dose for neuronal necrosis was 6 times the maximum recommended human dose of 20 mg / day on a mg / m2 basis In acute and repeat - dose neurotoxicity studies in female rats , oral administration of memantine and donepezil in combination resulted in increased incidence , severity , and distribution of neurodegeneration compared with memantine alone .
The no - effect levels of the combination were associated with clinically relevant plasma memantine and donepezil exposures .
The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The effectiveness of memantine as a treatment for patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer ' s disease was demonstrated in 2 randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical studies ( Studies 1 and 2 ) conducted in the United States that assessed both cognitive function and day to day function .
The mean age of patients participating in these two trials was 76 with a range of 50 - 93 years .
Approximately 66 % of patients were female and 91 % of patients were Caucasian .
A third study ( Study 3 ) , carried out in Latvia , enrolled patients with severe dementia , but did not assess cognitive function as a planned endpoint .
Study Outcome Measures : In each U . S . study , the effectiveness of memantine was determined using both an instrument designed to evaluate overall function through caregiver - related assessment , and an instrument that measures cognition .
Both studies showed that patients on memantine experienced significant improvement on both measures compared to placebo .
Day - to - day function was assessed in both studies using the modified Alzheimer ' s disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living inventory ( ADCS - ADL ) .
The ADCS - ADL consists of a comprehensive battery of ADL questions used to measure the functional capabilities of patients .
Each ADL item is rated from the highest level of independent performance to complete loss .
The investigator performs the inventory by interviewing a caregiver familiar with the behavior of the patient .
A subset of 19 items , including ratings of the patient ' s ability to eat , dress , bathe , telephone , travel , shop , and perform other household chores has been validated for the assessment of patients with moderate to severe dementia .
This is the modified ADCS - ADL , which has a scoring range of 0 to 54 , with the lower scores indicating greater functional impairment .
The ability of memantine to improve cognitive performance was assessed in both studies with the Severe Impairment Battery ( SIB ) , a multi - item instrument that has been validated for the evaluation of cognitive function in patients with moderate to severe dementia .
The SIB examines selected aspects of cognitive performance , including elements of attention , orientation , language , memory , visuospatial ability , construction , praxis , and social interaction .
The SIB scoring range is from 0 to 100 , with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment .
Study 1 ( Twenty - Eight - Week Study ) In a study of 28 weeks duration , 252 patients with moderate to severe probable Alzheimer ' s disease ( diagnosed by DSM - IV and NINCDS - ADRDA criteria , with Mini - Mental State Examination scores ≥ 3 and ≤ 14 and Global Deterioration Scale Stages 5 - 6 ) were randomized to memantine or placebo .
For patients randomized to memantine , treatment was initiated at 5 mg once daily and increased weekly by 5 mg / day in divided doses to a dose of 20 mg / day ( 10 mg twice a day ) .
Effects on the ADCS - ADL Figure 1 shows the time course for the change from baseline in the ADCS - ADL score for patients in the two treatment groups completing the 28 weeks of the study .
At 28 weeks of treatment , the mean difference in the ADCS - ADL change scores for the memantine - treated patients compared to the patients on placebo was 3 . 4 units .
Using an analysis based on all patients and carrying their last study observation forward ( LOCF analysis ) , memantine treatment was statistically significantly superior to placebo .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 2 shows the cumulative percentages of patients from each of the treatment groups who had attained at least the change in the ADCS - ADL shown on the X axis .
The curves show that both patients assigned to memantine and placebo have a wide range of responses and generally show deterioration ( a negative change in ADCS - ADL compared to baseline ) , but that the memantine group is more likely to show a smaller decline or an improvement .
( In a cumulative distribution display , a curve for an effective treatment would be shifted to the left of the curve for placebo , while an ineffective or deleterious treatment would be superimposed upon or shifted to the right of the curve for placebo ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Effects on the SIB Figure 3 shows the time course for the change from baseline in SIB score for the two treatment groups over the 28 weeks of the study .
At 28 weeks of treatment , the mean difference in the SIB change scores for the memantine - treated patients compared to the patients on placebo was 5 . 7 units .
Using an LOCF analysis , memantine treatment was statistically significantly superior to placebo .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 4 shows the cumulative percentages of patients from each treatment group who had attained at least the measure of change in SIB score shown on the X axis .
The curves show that both patients assigned to memantine and placebo have a wide range of responses and generally show deterioration , but that the memantine group is more likely to show a smaller decline or an improvement .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Study 2 ( Twenty - Four - Week Study ) In a study of 24 weeks duration , 404 patients with moderate to severe probable Alzheimer ' s disease ( diagnosed by NINCDS - ADRDA criteria , with Mini - Mental State Examination scores ≥ 5 and ≤ 14 ) who had been treated with donepezil for at least 6 months and who had been on a stable dose of donepezil for the last 3 months were randomized to memantine or placebo while still receiving donepezil .
For patients randomized to memantine , treatment was initiated at 5 mg once daily and increased weekly by 5 mg / day in divided doses to a dose of 20 mg / day ( 10 mg twice a day ) .
Effects on the ADCS - ADL Figure 5 shows the time course for the change from baseline in the ADCS - ADL score for the two treatment groups over the 24 weeks of the study .
At 24 weeks of treatment , the mean difference in the ADCS - ADL change scores for the memantine / donepezil treated patients ( combination therapy ) compared to the patients on placebo / donepezil ( monotherapy ) was 1 . 6 units .
Using an LOCF analysis , memantine / donepezil treatment was statistically significantly superior to placebo / donepezil .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 6 shows the cumulative percentages of patients from each of the treatment groups who had attained at least the measure of improvement in the ADCS - ADL shown on the X axis .
The curves show that both patients assigned to memantine / donepezil and placebo / donepezil have a wide range of responses and generally show deterioration , but that the memantine / donepezil group is more likely to show a smaller decline or an improvement .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Effects on the SIB Figure 7 shows the time course for the change from baseline in SIB score for the two treatment groups over the 24 weeks of the study .
At 24 weeks of treatment , the mean difference in the SIB change scores for the memantine / donepezil - treated patients compared to the patients on placebo / donepezil was 3 . 3 units .
Using an LOCF analysis , memantine / donepezil treatment was statistically significantly superior to placebo / donepezil .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 8 shows the cumulative percentages of patients from each treatment group who had attained at least the measure of improvement in SIB score shown on the X axis .
The curves show that both patients assigned to memantine / donepezil and placebo / donepezil have a wide range of responses , but that the memantine / donepezil group is more likely to show an improvement or a smaller decline .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Study 3 ( Twelve - Week Study ) In a double - blind study of 12 weeks duration , conducted in nursing homes in Latvia , 166 patients with dementia according to DSM - III - R , a Mini - Mental State Examination score of < 10 , and Global Deterioration Scale staging of 5 to 7 were randomized to either memantine or placebo .
For patients randomized to memantine , treatment was initiated at 5 mg once daily and increased to 10 mg once daily after 1 week .
The primary efficacy measures were the care dependency subscale of the Behavioral Rating Scale for Geriatric Patients ( BGP ) , a measure of day - to - day function , and a Clinical Global Impression of Change ( CGI - C ) , a measure of overall clinical effect .
No valid measure of cognitive function was used in this study .
A statistically significant treatment difference at 12 weeks that favored memantine over placebo was seen on both primary efficacy measures .
Because the patients entered were a mixture of Alzheimer ' s disease and vascular dementia , an attempt was made to distinguish the two groups and all patients were later designated as having either vascular dementia or Alzheimer ' s disease , based on their scores on the Hachinski Ischemic Scale at study entry .
Only about 50 % of the patients had computerized tomography of the brain .
For the subset designated as having Alzheimer ' s disease , a statistically significant treatment effect favoring memantine over placebo at 12 weeks was seen on both the BGP and CGI - C .
