1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE ILUVIEN ® ( fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant ) 0 . 19 mg is indicated for the treatment of diabetic macular edema ( DME ) in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure .
ILUVIEN contains a corticosteroid and is indicated for the treatment of diabetic macular edema ( DME ) in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • For ophthalmic intravitreal injection .
( 2 . 1 ) • The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under aseptic conditions .
( 2 . 2 ) • Following the intravitreal injection , patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure and for endophthalmitis .
( 2 . 2 ) 2 . 1 General Dosing Information For ophthalmic intravitreal injection .
2 . 2 Administration The intravitreal injection procedure should be carried out under aseptic conditions , which include use of sterile gloves , a sterile drape , a sterile caliper , and a sterile eyelid speculum ( or equivalent ) .
Adequate anesthesia and a broad - spectrum microbicide should be given prior to the injection .
The injection procedure for ILUVIEN is as follows : • The exterior of the tray should not be considered sterile .
An assistant ( non - sterile ) should remove the tray from the carton and examine the tray and lid for damage .
If damaged , do not use unit .
If acceptable , the assistant should peel the lid from the tray without touching the interior surface .
• Visually check through the viewing window of the preloaded applicator to ensure that there is a drug implant inside .
• Remove the applicator from the tray with sterile gloved hands touching only the sterile interior tray surface and applicator .
Prior to injection , the applicator tip must be kept above the horizontal plane to ensure that the implant is properly positioned within the applicator .
• To reduce the amount of air administered with the implant , the administration procedure requires two steps .
Before inserting the needle into the eye , remove the protective cap then gently push the applicator button down and slide it to the first stop ( at the curved black marks alongside the button track ) .
At the first stop , release the button and it should move to the UP position .
If the button does not rise to the UP position , do not proceed with this unit .
• Optimal placement of the implant is inferior to the optic disc and posterior to the equator of the eye .
Measure 4 millimeters inferotemporal from the limbus with the aid of calipers for point of entry into the sclera .
• Inspect the tip of the needle to ensure it is not bent .
• Gently displace the conjunctiva so that after withdrawing the needle , the conjunctival and scleral needle entry sites will not align .
Care should be taken to avoid contact between the needle and the lid margin or lashes .
Insert the needle through the conjunctiva and sclera .
To release the implant , while the button is in the UP position , advance the button by sliding it forward to the end of the button track and remove the needle .
Note : Ensure that the button reaches the end of the track before removing the needle .
• Remove the lid speculum and perform indirect ophthalmoscopy to verify placement of the implant , adequate central retinal artery perfusion and absence of any other complications .
Following the injection , patients should be monitored for elevation in intraocular pressure and for endophthalmitis .
Monitoring may consist of a check for perfusion of the optic nerve head immediately after the injection , tonometry within 30 minutes following the injection , and biomicroscopy between two and seven days following the injection .
Patients should be instructed to report without delay any symptoms suggestive of endophthalmitis .

6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Adverse reactions associated with ophthalmic steroids including ILUVIEN include cataract formation and subsequent cataract surgery , elevated intraocular pressure , which may be associated with optic nerve damage , visual acuity and field defects , secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex , and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of the cornea or sclera .
ILUVIEN was studied in two multicenter , randomized , sham - controlled , masked trials in which patients with diabetic macular edema ( DME ) were treated with either ILUVIEN ( n = 375 ) or sham ( n = 185 ) .
Table 1 summarizes safety data available when the last subject completed the last 36 month follow up visit for the two primary ILUVIEN trials .
In these trials , subjects were eligible for retreatment no earlier than 12 months after study entry .
Over the three year follow up period , approximately 75 % of the ILUVIEN treated subjects received only one ILUVIEN implant .
The most common ocular ( study eye ) and non - ocular adverse reactions are shown in Tables 1 and 2 : Table 1 : Ocular Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥ 1 % of Patients and Non - ocular Adverse Reactions Reported by ≥ 5 % of Patients1 Includes cataract , cataract nuclear , cataract subcapsular , cataract cortical and cataract diabetic in patients who were phakic at baseline .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of ILUVIEN in pregnant women .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with fluocinolone acetonide .
Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels .
ILUVIEN should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids are present in human milk and could suppress growth and interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production .
The systemic concentration of fluocinolone acetonide following intravitreal treatment with ILUVIEN is low [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
It is not known whether intravitreal treatment with ILUVIEN could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk .
Exercise caution when ILUVIEN is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ILUVIEN in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients .
11 DESCRIPTION ILUVIEN is a sterile non - bioerodable intravitreal implant containing 0 . 19 mg ( 190 mcg ) fluocinolone acetonide in a 36 - month sustained - release drug delivery system .
ILUVIEN is designed to release fluocinolone acetonide at an initial rate of 0 . 25 µg / day .
ILUVIEN is preloaded into a single - use applicator to facilitate injection of the implant directly into the vitreous .
The drug substance is a synthetic corticosteroid , fluocinolone acetonide .
The chemical name for fluocinolone acetonide is ( 6α , 11β , 16α ) - 6 , 9 - difluoro - 11 , 21 - dihydroxy - 16 , 17 - [ ( 1 - methylethylidene ) bis - ( oxy ) ] - pregna - 1 , 4 - diene - 3 , 20 - dione .
Its chemical structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] MW 452 . 50 ; molecular formula C24H30F206 Fluocinolone acetonide is a white or almost white , microcrystalline powder , practically insoluble in water , soluble in methanol , ethanol , chloroform and acetone , and sparingly soluble in ether .
Each ILUVIEN consists of a light brown 3 . 5 mm x 0 . 37 mm implant containing 0 . 19 mg of the active ingredient fluocinolone acetonide and the following inactive ingredients : polyimide tube , polyvinyl alcohol , silicone adhesive and water for injection .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Corticosteroids inhibit inflammatory responses to a variety of inciting agents including multiple inflammatory cytokines .
They inhibit edema , fibrin deposition , capillary dilation , leukocyte migration , capillary proliferation , fibroblast proliferation , deposition of collagen , and scar formation associated with inflammation .
Corticosteroids are thought to act by inhibition of phospholipase A2 via induction of inhibitory proteins collectively called lipocortins .
It is postulated that these proteins control biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting release of the common precursor , arachidonic acid .
Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In a human pharmacokinetic study of ILUVIEN , fluocinolone acetonide concentrations in plasma were below the lower limit of quantitation of the assay ( 100 pg / mL ) at all post - administration time points from Day 7 through Month 36 following intravitreal administration of a 0 . 2 mcg / day or 0 . 5 mcg / day fluocinolone acetonide insert .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term animal studies have not been conducted to determine the carcinogenic potential or the effect on fertility of ILUVIEN .
Fluocinolone acetonide was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames test ( S . typhimurium and E . coli ) and the mouse lymphoma TK assay , or in vivo in the mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of ILUVIEN was assessed in two three year , randomized ( 2 : 1 , active : sham ) , multicenter , double - masked , parallel - groups studies that enrolled patients with diabetic macular edema ( DME ) that had previously been treated with laser photocoagulation .
The primary efficacy endpoint in both trials was the proportion of subjects in whom vision had improved by 15 letters or more from baseline after 24 months of follow - up .
