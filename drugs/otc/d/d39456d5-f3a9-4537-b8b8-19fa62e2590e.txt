Description Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc 99 m Medronate is a multidose reaction vial which contains the sterile , non - pyrogenic , non - radioactive ingredients necessary to produce Technetium Tc 99 m Medronate Injection for diagnostic use by Intravenous injection .
Each 10 mL multidose vial contains : • • Medronic acid : 20 mg • • Ascorbic acid : 1 mg • • Stannous fluoride , SnF2 : 0 . 13 mg ( minimum ) • • Total tin ( maximum , as stannous fluoride , SnF2 ) : 0 . 38 mg The pH is adjusted to 6 . 5 ( 6 . 3 to 6 . 7 ) with sodium hydroxide and / or hydrochloric acid prior to lyophilization .
No bacteriostatic preservative is present in the vial .
The contents of the vial are lyophilized and sealed under nitrogen at the time of manufacture .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] When a solution of sterile , non - pyrogenic , oxidant - free Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m Injection is added to the vial , the diagnostic agent , Technetium Tc 99 m Medronate is formed for administration by intravenous injection .
The pH of the reconstituted product is 5 . 4 to 6 . 8 .
The precise structure of Technetium Tc 99 m Medronate Injection is not known at this time .
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS : Technetium Tc 99 m decays by isomeric transition with a physical half - life of 6 . 02 hours1 .
The principal photon that is useful for detection and imaging studies is listed in Table 1 .

EXTERNAL RADIATION : The specific gamma ray constant for Tc 99 m is 0 . 78 R / millicurie - hr at 1 cm .
The first half - value layer is 0 . 017 cm of lead ( Pb ) .
A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of the various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 2 .
To facilitate control of the radiation exposure from millicurie amounts of this radionuclide , the use of a 0 . 25 cm thickness of Pb will attenuate the radiation emitted by a factor of about 1 , 000 .

Upon intravenous injection , Technetium Tc 99 m Medronate exhibits a specific affinity for areas of altered osteogenesis .
In humans , blood levels fall to 4 to 10 % of the injected dose by two hours post - injection and to 3 to 5 % by three hours .
Uptake of Technetium Tc 99 m Medronate Injection in bone appears to be related to osteogenic activity and to skeletal blood perfusion .
The deposition in the skeleton is bilaterally symmetrical , with increased accumulation in the axial structure as compared to the appendicular skeleton .
There is increased activity in the distal aspect on long bones as compared to the diaphyses .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE : Technetium Tc 99 m Medronate Injection may be used as a bone imaging agent to delineate areas of altered osteogenesis .
CONTRAINDICATIONS : None known .
WARNINGS : This class of compounds is known to complex cations such as calcium .
Particular caution should be used with patients who have , or may be predisposed to hypocalcemia ( i . e . , alkalosis ) .
Preliminary reports indicate impairment of brain scans using Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m Injection which have been preceded by a bone scan using an agent containing stannous ions .
The impairment may result in false - positive or false - negative brain scans .
It is recommended , where feasible , that brain scans precede bone imaging procedures .
Alternatively , a brain imaging agent such as Technetium Tc 99 m Pentetate Injection may be employed .
PRECAUTIONS : General Contents of the vial are intended only for use in the preparation of Technetium Tc 99 m Medronate Injection and are NOT to be administered directly to the patient .
Technetium Tc 99 m Medronate Injection as well as other radioactive drugs must be handled with care , and appropriate safety measures should be used to minimize radiation exposure to the patient and clinical personnel consistent with proper patient management .
To minimize radiation dose to the bladder , the patients should be encouraged to drink fluids and to void immediately before the examination and as often thereafter as possible for the next 4 to 6 hours .
Technetium Tc 99 m Medronate Injection should be formulated within six ( 6 ) hours prior to clinical use .
Optimal imaging results are obtained 1 to 4 hours after administration .
The finding of an abnormal concentration of radioactivity implies the existence of underlying pathology , but further study is required to distinguish benign from malignant lesions .
