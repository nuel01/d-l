MINUTE - FOAM Topical Fluoride Foaming Solution ( Acidulated Phosphate Fluoride Containing 1 . 23 % w / w Fluoride Ion ) FOR PROFESSIONAL USE ONLY Active Ingredient : Acidulated Phosphate Fluoride ( Sodium Fluoride and Hydrofluoric Acid ) 1 . 23 % w / w fluoride ion .
DESCRIPTION : Oral - B Minute Foam is a flavored aqueous foaming solution of acidulated phosphate sodium fluoride with pH of 3 . 5 and a fluoride ion concentration of 1 . 23 % w / w .
Inactive Ingredients : Purified water , poloxamer 407 , isobutane , poloxamer 234 , phosphoric acid , sodium saccharin , flavor .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY : Acidulated Phosphate Fluoride inhibits caries formation by reducing enamel solubility and enhancing remineralization .
INDICATION AND USE : A topically - applied foaming solution to aid in the prevention of dental caries .
CONTRAINDICATIONS : Do not use in patients with hypersensitivity to fluoride .
Do not use in patients with dysphagia .
WARNINGS : DO NOT SWALLOW Accidental ingestion of the usual treatment dose ( approx 12 . 4 mg of fluoride ) is not harmful .
In the event more than the treatment dose is swallowed , administer calcium ( e . g . milk ) and get medical or contact a Poison control Center right away .
One bottle of Minute Foam contained 1 . 95 grams of fluoride ion which could be lethal for children adults .
Keep out of the reach of infants and children under 12 years .
Pediatric patients under age 12 should be supervised during use of this product .
Avoid spraying towards open flame .
Contents under pressure .
Do not puncture or incinerate .
Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures over 120 F ( 49 C ) .
PRECAUTIONS : FOR PROFESSIONAL USE ONLY Laboratory studies have indicated that repeated use of Acidulated Phosphate Fluoride products may dull porcelain and composite restorations .
Safety and effectiveness below age 6 have not been established .
There have been no long term studies with this product to evaluate carcinogenic , mutagenic or impairment of fertility potential .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed in female and male mice at doses ranging from 2 . 4 to 18 . 8 mg / kg sodium fluoride of body weight ( 3 , 4 ) .
Equivocal evidence of carcinogenicity was reported in male rats at doses ranging from 2 . 5 to 4 . 1 mg / kg fluoride , but no evidence of carcinogenicity was observed in female rates ( 3 , 4 ) .
In another study , no carcinogenicity was observed in rats treated with fluoride up to25 mg / kg of body weight ( 5 ) .
Overall , epidemiological studies do not show an association between fluoridated drinking water and increased cancer risks in humans ( 7 ) .
Fluoride ion is not mutagenic in standard bacterial systems but has been associated with genetic aberrations in cultured human cells at doses much higher than expected for human exposure ( 6 , 8 ) .
Some in vivo studies report chromosomal aberrations in rodents while other studies using similar protocols report negative results ( 7 ) .
Potential adverse reproductive effects of fluoride exposure in humans have not been adequately evaluated .
Adverse reproductive effects of fluoride have been reported in animal studies , but at high concentrations sufficient to produce other manifestations of toxicity ( 9 ) .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category B . Fluoride readily crosses the placenta ( 7 , 9 ) .
Animal studies ( rats and rabbits ) have shown that fluoride is not a teratogen ( 10 , 12 , 13 ) .
Maternal exposure to 18 mg Fluoride / kg of body weight did not affect maternal body weight , litter size or fetal weight and did not increase frequency of skeletal or visceral malformations ( 10 ) .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Several epidemiological studies show no increase in birth defects in areas with fluoridated water compared to areas with low fluoridated water ( 7 ) .
However , caution should be exercised when fluoride is administered to pregnant women .
Nursing Mothers : Due to the relative insensitivity of human milk fluoride levels to changes in maternal fluoride intake , and due to the low concentrations of fluoride in human milk , fluoride supplementation during lactation would not be expected to significantly affect fluoride intake by the nursing infant ( 11 ) .
However , caution should be exercised when fluoride is administered to nursing women .
Pediatric Use : The use of fluoride solutions , gels , and foams containing up to 1 . 23 % fluoride ion as caries preventives in pediatric patients aged 6 to 16 years is supported by clinical studies in students aged 6 to 12 years ( 1 , 2 ) .
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years has not been established .
Please refer to CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS sections .
Geriatric Use : No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between geriatric and younger patients .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , therefore the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
ADVERSE REACTIONS : Developing teeth of children under age 6 may become permanently discolored if excessive amounts are repeatedly swallowed .
The following adverse reactions are possible in individuals hypersensitive to fluoride : eczema , atopic dermatitis , urticaria , gastric distress , headache and weakness .
OVERDOSAGE : Accidental ingestion of large amounts of fluoride can result in acute irritation of the mouth and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , hematemesis epigastric cramping and abdominal pain .
If large amounts of fluoride equal to or greater than 5 mg fluoride / kg body weight ( or 2 . 3 mg fluoride / lb body weight ) are ingested , give calcium ( e . g . milk , 5 % calcium gluconate or calcium lactate solution ) orally to relieve gastrointestinal symptoms and admit immediately to a hospital facility .
A standard treatment dose of Minute - Foam contains approximately 12 . 4 mg fluoride .
One 165 g ( 5 . 8 oz ) bottle contains approximately 1 . 95 g of fluoride .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION : Adults and Children 6 years and over : Use foam 2 times a year .
This initial time you dispense from a new bottle , gently lift upward on the nozzle to break the protective seal ( thin plastic located adjacent to trigger ) .
If this seal is broken do not use the product .
Shake bottle vigorously for 3 - 4 seconds prior to dispensing .
Invert bottle 180 degree with nozzle tip pointed downward into tray .
Place nozzle tip close to the tray floor and at one end of the tray arch .
Moving from one end of the tray to the other in one fluid motion , slowly press down on the trigger .
Dispense foam into applicator tray .
( Note : foam will expand slightly to fill the tray . )
Immediately place trays in mouth .
( Do not fill trays with foam too far in advance of treatment as the foam will collapse and not be as effective . )
Have patient bite down on the trays lightly but firmly for 4 minutes .
Remove trays and have patient expectorate excess .
Instruct patient not to eat , drink , or rinse for at least 30 minutes .
For optimal tooth coverage , use a fluoride applicator tray which is deep enough to reach the entire vertical height of all teeth ( even the molars ) HOW SUPPLIED : Minute - Foam is available in a 165 g ( 5 . 8 oz ) plastic aerosol container in six different flavors ; NDC 0041 - 0340 - 06 Banana Splitz , NDC 0041 - 03141 - 06 Mellow Mint , NDC 0041 - 0342 - 06 Orang - a - Tangy , NDC 0041 - 0345 - 06 Bubblegum , NDC 0041 - 0346 - 06 Strawberry , NDC 0041 - 0347 - 06 Grape Punch .
