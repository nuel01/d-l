WARNING : LACTIC ACIDOSIS Postmarketing cases of metformin - associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death , hypothermia , hypotension , and resistant bradyarrhythmias .
The onset of metformin - associated lactic acidosis is often subtle , accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise , myalgias , respiratory distress , somnolence , and abdominal pain .
Metformin - associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels ( > 5 mmol / Liter ) , anion gap acidosis ( without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia ) , an increased lactate / pyruvate ratio , and metformin plasma levels generally > 5 mcg / mL [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Risk factors for metformin - associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment , concomitant use of certain drugs ( e . g . , carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate ) , age 65 years old or greater , having a radiological study with contrast , surgery and other procedures , hypoxic states ( e . g . , acute congestive heart failure ) , excessive alcohol intake , and hepatic impairment .
Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin - associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided in the full prescribing information [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 , 8 . 7 ) ] .
If metformin - associated lactic acidosis is suspected , immediately discontinue JANUMET and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting .
Prompt hemodialysis is recommended [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .

( 5 . 7 , 6 . 2 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Lactic Acidosis : See boxed warning .
( 5 . 1 ) • Pancreatitis : There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis , including fatal and non - fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis .
If pancreatitis is suspected , promptly discontinue JANUMET .
( 5 . 2 ) • Heart Failure : Has been observed with two other members of the DPP - 4 inhibitor class .
Consider risks and benefits of JANUMET in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure .
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms .
( 5 . 3 ) • Acute Renal Failure : Has been reported postmarketing , sometimes requiring dialysis .
Before initiating JANUMET and at least annually thereafter , assess renal function .
( 5 . 4 ) • Vitamin B 12 Deficiency : Metformin may lower vitamin B 12 levels .
Measure hematologic parameters annually and vitamin B 12 at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities .
( 5 . 5 ) • Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues : Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and / or an insulin secretagogue .
A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required .
( 5 . 6 ) • Hypersensitivity Reactions : There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin such as anaphylaxis , angioedema , and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens - Johnson syndrome .
Promptly stop JANUMET , assess for other potential causes , institute appropriate monitoring and treatment .
( 5 . 7 ) • Severe and Disabling Arthralgia : Has been reported in patients taking DPP - 4 inhibitors .
Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate .
( 5 . 8 ) • Bullous Pemphigoid : There have been postmarketing reports requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP - 4 inhibitors .
Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions .
If bullous pemphigoid is suspected , discontinue JANUMET .
( 5 . 9 ) 5 . 1 Lactic Acidosis There have been postmarketing cases of metformin - associated lactic acidosis , including fatal cases .
These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise , myalgias , abdominal pain , respiratory distress , or increased somnolence ; however , hypothermia , hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis .
Metformin - associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations ( > 5 mmol / Liter ) , anion gap acidosis ( without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia ) , and an increased lactate / pyruvate ratio ; metformin plasma levels were generally > 5 mcg / mL .
Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis , especially in patients at risk .
If metformin - associated lactic acidosis is suspected , general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting , along with immediate discontinuation of JANUMET .
In JANUMET - treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis , prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin ( metformin HCl is dialyzable , with a clearance of up to 170 mL / min under good hemodynamic conditions ) .
Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery .
Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue JANUMET and report these symptoms to their health care provider .
For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin - associated lactic acidosis , recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin - associated lactic acidosis are provided below : Renal Impairment The postmarketing metformin - associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment .
The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin - associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney .
Clinical recommendations based upon the patient ' s renal function include [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] : • Before initiating JANUMET , obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) .
• JANUMET is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR below 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
• JANUMET is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30 and less than 45 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 because these patients require a lower dosage of sitagliptin than what is available in the fixed combination JANUMET product .
• Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking JANUMET .
In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment ( e . g . , the elderly ) , renal function should be assessed more frequently .
Drug Interactions The concomitant use of JANUMET with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin - associated lactic acidosis : those that impair renal function , result in significant hemodynamic change , interfere with acid - base balance or increase metformin accumulation [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Therefore , consider more frequent monitoring of patients .
Age 65 or Greater The risk of metformin - associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient ' s age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic , renal , or cardiac impairment than younger patients .
Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
Radiological Studies with Contrast Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin - treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis .
Stop JANUMET at the time of , or prior to , an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment , alcoholism , or heart failure ; or in patients who will be administered intra - arterial iodinated contrast .
Re - evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure , and restart JANUMET if renal function is stable .
Surgery and Other Procedures Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion , hypotension and renal impairment .
JANUMET should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake .
Hypoxic States Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin - associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure ( particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia ) .
Cardiovascular collapse ( shock ) , acute myocardial infarction , sepsis , and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia .
When such events occur , discontinue JANUMET .
Excessive Alcohol Intake Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin - associated lactic acidosis .
Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving JANUMET .
Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin - associated lactic acidosis .
This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels .
Therefore , avoid use of JANUMET in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease .
5 . 2 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis , including fatal and non - fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis , in patients taking JANUMET .
After initiation of JANUMET , patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis .
If pancreatitis is suspected , JANUMET should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated .
It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUMET .
5 . 3 Heart Failure An association between dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 ( DPP - 4 ) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP - 4 inhibitor class .
These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease .
Consider the risks and benefits of JANUMET prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure , such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment , and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy .
Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms .
If heart failure develops , evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JANUMET .
5 . 4 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function , including acute renal failure , sometimes requiring dialysis .
Before initiation of therapy with JANUMET and at least annually thereafter , renal function should be assessed .
In patients in whom development of renal dysfunction is anticipated , particularly in elderly patients , renal function should be assessed more frequently and JANUMET discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present .
JANUMET is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 5 Vitamin B 12 Deficiency In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration , a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7 % of patients .
Such decrease , possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 - intrinsic factor complex , may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation .
Certain individuals ( those with inadequate vitamin B 12 or calcium intake or absorption ) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B 12 levels .
Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B 12 measurements at 2 - to 3 - year intervals in patients on JANUMET and manage any abnormalities [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 6 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues JANUMET may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and / or an insulin secretagogue ( e . g . , sulfonylurea ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with JANUMET [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
5 . 7 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin , one of the components of JANUMET .
These reactions include anaphylaxis , angioedema , and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens - Johnson syndrome .
Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with sitagliptin , with some reports occurring after the first dose .
If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected , discontinue JANUMET , assess for other potential causes for the event , and institute alternative treatment for diabetes .
[ See Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) . ]
Angioedema has also been reported with other DPP - 4 inhibitors .
Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP - 4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JANUMET .
5 . 8 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP - 4 inhibitors .
The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years .
Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication .
A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP - 4 inhibitor .
Consider DPP - 4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate .
5 . 9 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP - 4 inhibitor use .
In reported cases , patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP - 4 inhibitor .
Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JANUMET .
If bullous pemphigoid is suspected , JANUMET should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment .

[ 2 ] Abdominal discomfort was included in the analysis of abdominal pain in the study of initial therapy .
Sitagliptin in Combination with Metformin and Glimepiride In a 24 - week placebo - controlled study of sitagliptin 100 mg as add - on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin and glimepiride ( sitagliptin , N = 116 ; placebo , N = 113 ) , the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in ≥ 5 % of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were : hypoglycemia ( Table 3 ) and headache ( 6 . 9 % , 2 . 7 % ) .
Sitagliptin in Combination with Metformin and Rosiglitazone In a placebo - controlled study of sitagliptin 100 mg as add - on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin and rosiglitazone ( sitagliptin , N = 181 ; placebo , N = 97 ) , the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality through Week 18 in ≥ 5 % of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were : upper respiratory tract infection ( sitagliptin , 5 . 5 % ; placebo , 5 . 2 % ) and nasopharyngitis ( 6 . 1 % , 4 . 1 % ) .
Through Week 54 , the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in ≥ 5 % of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were : upper respiratory tract infection ( sitagliptin , 15 . 5 % ; placebo , 6 . 2 % ) , nasopharyngitis ( 11 . 0 % , 9 . 3 % ) , peripheral edema ( 8 . 3 % , 5 . 2 % ) , and headache ( 5 . 5 % , 4 . 1 % ) .
Sitagliptin in Combination with Metformin and Insulin In a 24 - week placebo - controlled study of sitagliptin 100 mg as add - on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin and insulin ( sitagliptin , N = 229 ; placebo , N = 233 ) , the only adverse reaction reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in ≥ 5 % of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo was hypoglycemia ( Table 3 ) .
Hypoglycemia In the above studies ( N = 5 ) , adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia ; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required although most ( 77 % ) reports of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a blood glucose measurement ≤ 70 mg / dL .
When the combination of sitagliptin and metformin was coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin , the percentage of patients reporting at least one adverse reaction of hypoglycemia was higher than that observed with placebo and metformin coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin ( Table 3 ) .

[ 2 ] Based on total number of events ( i . e . , a single patient may have had multiple events ) .
[ 3 ] Severe events of hypoglycemia were defined as those events requiring medical assistance or exhibiting depressed level / loss of consciousness or seizure .
The overall incidence of reported adverse reactions of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on diet and exercise was 0 . 6 % in patients given placebo , 0 . 6 % in patients given sitagliptin alone , 0 . 8 % in patients given metformin alone , and 1 . 6 % in patients given sitagliptin in combination with metformin .
In patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin alone , the overall incidence of adverse reactions of hypoglycemia was 1 . 3 % in patients given add - on sitagliptin and 2 . 1 % in patients given add - on placebo .
In the study of sitagliptin and add - on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone , the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 2 . 2 % in patients given add - on sitagliptin and 0 . 0 % in patients given add - on placebo through Week 18 .
Through Week 54 , the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 3 . 9 % in patients given add - on sitagliptin and 1 . 0 % in patients given add - on placebo .
In an additional , 30 - week placebo - controlled , study of patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin comparing the maintenance of sitagliptin 100 mg versus withdrawal of sitagliptin when initiating basal insulin therapy , the event rate and incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia ( blood glucose measurement ≤ 70 mg / dL ) did not differ between the sitagliptin and placebo groups .
Vital Signs and Electrocardiograms With the combination of sitagliptin and metformin , no clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG ( including in QTc interval ) were observed .
Pancreatitis In a pooled analysis of 19 double - blind clinical trials that included data from 10 , 246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg / day ( N = 5429 ) or corresponding ( active or placebo ) control ( N = 4817 ) , the incidence of acute pancreatitis was 0 . 1 per 100 patient - years in each group ( 4 patients with an event in 4708 patient - years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3942 patient - years for control ) .
Sitagliptin The most common adverse experience in sitagliptin monotherapy reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in ≥ 5 % of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo was nasopharyngitis .
Metformin The most common ( > 5 % ) established adverse reactions due to initiation of metformin therapy are diarrhea , nausea / vomiting , flatulence , abdominal discomfort , indigestion , asthenia , and headache .
Laboratory Tests Sitagliptin The incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with sitagliptin and metformin ( 7 . 6 % ) compared to patients treated with placebo and metformin ( 8 . 7 % ) .
In most but not all studies , a small increase in white blood cell count ( approximately 200 cells / microL difference in WBC vs placebo ; mean baseline WBC approximately 6600 cells / microL ) was observed due to a small increase in neutrophils .
This change in laboratory parameters is not considered to be clinically relevant .
Metformin In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration , a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels , without clinical manifestations , was observed in approximately 7 % of patients .
Such decrease , possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 - intrinsic factor complex , is , however , very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUMET , sitagliptin , or metformin .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis , angioedema , rash , urticaria , cutaneous vasculitis , and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens - Johnson syndrome ; upper respiratory tract infection ; hepatic enzyme elevations ; acute pancreatitis , including fatal and non - fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] ; worsening renal function , including acute renal failure ( sometimes requiring dialysis ) ; severe and disabling arthralgia ; bullous pemphigoid ; constipation ; vomiting ; headache ; myalgia ; pain in extremity ; back pain ; pruritus ; mouth ulceration ; stomatitis ; cholestatic , hepatocellular , and mixed hepatocellular liver injury ; rhabdomyolysis .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 4 presents clinically significant drug interactions with JANUMET : Table 4 : Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with JANUMETCarbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Clinical Impact : Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors frequently cause a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non - anion gap , hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis .
Concomitant use of these drugs with JANUMET may increase the risk for lactic acidosis .
Intervention : Consider more frequent monitoring of these patients .
Examples : Topiramate , zonisamide , acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide .
Drugs that Reduce Metformin Clearance Clinical Impact : Concomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of metformin ( e . g . , organic cationic transporter - 2 [ OCT 2 ] / multidrug and toxin extrusion [ MATE ] inhibitors ) could increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Intervention : Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use with JANUMET .
Examples : Ranolazine , vandetanib , dolutegravir , and cimetidine .
Alcohol Clinical Impact : Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism .
Intervention : Warn patients against alcohol intake while receiving JANUMET .
Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin Clinical Impact : Coadministration of JANUMET with an insulin secretagogue ( e . g . , sulfonylurea ) or insulin may increase the risk of hypoglycemia .
Intervention : Patients receiving an insulin secretagogue or insulin may require lower doses of the insulin secretagogue or insulin .
Drugs Affecting Glycemic Control Clinical Impact : Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control .
Intervention : When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving JANUMET , observe the patient closely for loss of blood glucose control .
When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving JANUMET , observe the patient closely for hypoglycemia .
Examples : Thiazides and other diuretics , corticosteroids , phenothiazines , thyroid products , estrogens , oral contraceptives , phenytoin , nicotinic acid , sympathomimetics , calcium channel blockers , and isoniazid .

( 8 . 3 ) • Geriatric Use : Assess renal function more frequently .
( 8 . 5 ) • Hepatic Impairment : Avoid use in patients with hepatic impairment .
( 8 . 7 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to JANUMET during pregnancy .
Health care providers are encouraged to report any prenatal exposure to JANUMET by calling the Pregnancy Registry at 1 - 800 - 986 - 8999 .
Risk Summary The limited available data with JANUMET in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug - associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage .
Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk [ see Data ] .
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30 - times and 20 - times , respectively , the 100 mg clinical dose , based on AUC .
No adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 2 - and 6 - times , respectively , a 2000 mg clinical dose , based on body surface area [ see Data ] .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 - 10 % in women with pre - gestational diabetes with a Hemoglobin A1c > 7 % and has been reported to be as high as 20 - 25 % in women with a Hemoglobin A1c > 10 % .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - Associated Maternal and / or Embryo / Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis , pre - eclampsia , spontaneous abortions , preterm delivery , and delivery complications .
Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects , still birth , and macrosomia related morbidity .
Data Human Data Published data from post - marketing studies do not report a clear association with metformin and major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin is used during pregnancy .
However , these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations , including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups .
Animal Data Sitagliptin and Metformin No animal reproduction studies were conducted with the coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin .
Sitagliptin In embryo - fetal development studies , sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis ( gestation day 6 to 20 ) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg / kg ( 30 - times the 100 mg clinical dose ) and 125 mg / kg ( 20 - times the 100 mg clinical dose ) , respectively , based on AUC .
Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg / kg , or approximately 100 - times the clinical dose , based on AUC .
Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits .
Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg / kg .
Metformin Metformin did not cause adverse developmental effects when administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits up to 600 mg / kg / day during the period of organogenesis .
This represents an exposure of about 2 - and 6 - times a 2000 mg clinical dose based on body surface area ( mg / m 2 ) for rats and rabbits , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of JANUMET in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Limited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk [ see Data ] .
There are no reports of adverse effects on breastfed infants exposed to metformin .
There is no information on the effects of metformin on milk production .
Sitagliptin is present in rat milk and therefore possibly present in human milk [ see Data ] .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for JANUMET and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JANUMET or from the underlying maternal condition .
Data Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to plasma ratio of 4 : 1 .
Metformin Published clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk , which resulted in infant doses approximately 0 . 11 % to 1 % of the maternal weight - adjusted dosage and a milk / plasma ratio ranging between 0 . 13 and 1 .
However , the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as therapy with metformin may result in ovulation in some anovulatory women .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JANUMET have not been established in pediatric patients .
Three 20 - week double - blind , placebo - controlled studies each with 34 - week extensions were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in 410 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes , with or without insulin therapy ( HbA1c 6 . 5 - 10 % for patients not on insulin , HbA1c 7 - 10 % for patients on insulin ) .
At study entry , patients in study 1 were not treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents ; patients in studies 2 and 3 were on maximally tolerated metformin therapy .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 20 weeks of therapy .
The pre - specified primary efficacy analyses included data from study 1 and pooled data from studies 2 and 3 , regardless of glycemic rescue or treatment discontinuation .
In both efficacy analyses , the effect of treatment with sitagliptin was not significantly different from placebo .
In study 1 , the mean baseline HbA1c was 7 . 5 % , and 12 % of patients were on insulin therapy .
At week 20 , the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin ( N = 95 ) was 0 . 06 % compared to 0 . 23 % in patients treated with placebo ( N = 95 ) , a difference of - 0 . 17 % ( 95 % CI : - 0 . 62 , 0 . 28 ) .
In studies 2 and 3 , the mean baseline HbA1c was 8 . 0 % , 15 % of patients were on insulin and 72 % were on metformin HCl doses of greater than 1 , 500 mg daily .
At week 20 , the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin ( N = 107 ) was - 0 . 23 % compared to 0 . 09 % in patients treated with placebo ( N = 113 ) , a difference of - 0 . 33 % ( 95 % CI : - 0 . 70 , 0 . 05 ) .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use JANUMET In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis .
Renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients .
[ See Contraindications ( 4 ) ; Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 4 ) ; Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) . ]
Sitagliptin Of the total number of subjects ( N = 3884 ) in clinical studies of sitagliptin , 725 patients were 65 years and over , while 61 patients were 75 years and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects .
While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
Metformin Controlled clinical studies of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients , although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and young patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment JANUMET JANUMET is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30 and less than 45 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 because these patients require a lower dosage of sitagliptin than what is available in the fixed dose combination JANUMET product .
JANUMET is contraindicated in severe renal impairment , patients with an eGFR below 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 .
[ See Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) . ]
Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is excreted by the kidney , and sitagliptin exposure is increased in patients with renal impairment .
[ See Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) . ]
Metformin Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Use of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis .
JANUMET is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment .
[ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) . ]
10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of overdose with JANUMET , contact the Poison Control Center .
In the event of an overdose , it is reasonable to employ supportive measures , e . g . , remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract , employ clinical monitoring ( including obtaining an electrocardiogram ) , and institute supportive therapy as indicated by the patient ' s clinical status .
Sitagliptin is modestly dialyzable .
In clinical studies , approximately 13 . 5 % of the dose was removed over a 3 - to 4 - hour hemodialysis session .
Prolonged hemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate .
It is not known if sitagliptin is dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis .
Overdose of metformin has occurred , including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams .
Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10 % of cases , but no causal association with metformin has been established .
Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32 % of metformin overdose cases [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL / min under good hemodynamic conditions .
Therefore , hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected .
11 DESCRIPTION JANUMET ( sitagliptin and metformin HCl ) tablets for oral use contain two antihyperglycemic drugs : sitagliptin and metformin HCl .
Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is an orally - active inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 ( DPP - 4 ) enzyme .
Sitagliptin is present in JANUMET tablets in the form of sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate .
Sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate is described chemically as 7 - [ ( 3 R ) - 3 - amino - 1 - oxo - 4 - ( 2 , 4 , 5 - trifluorophenyl ) butyl ] - 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 - tetrahydro - 3 - ( trifluoromethyl ) - 1 , 2 , 4 - triazolo [ 4 , 3 - a ] pyrazine phosphate ( 1 : 1 ) monohydrate with an empirical formula of C 16 H 15 F 6 N 5 O ∙ H 3 PO 4 ∙ H 2 O and a molecular weight of 523 . 32 .

In addition , the film coating contains the following inactive ingredients : polyvinyl alcohol , polyethylene glycol , talc , titanium dioxide , red iron oxide , and black iron oxide .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action JANUMET JANUMET combines two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus : sitagliptin , a dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 ( DPP - 4 ) inhibitor , and metformin HCl , a member of the biguanide class .
Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is a DPP - 4 inhibitor , which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones .
Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin , thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones .
Incretin hormones , including glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( GLP - 1 ) and glucose - dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) , are released by the intestine throughout the day , and levels are increased in response to a meal .
These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme DPP - 4 .
The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis .
When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated , GLP - 1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP .
GLP - 1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells , leading to reduced hepatic glucose production .
By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels , sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose - dependent manner .
Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP - 4 and does not inhibit DPP - 8 or DPP - 9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses .
Metformin Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus , lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose .
Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production , decreases intestinal absorption of glucose , and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization .
With metformin therapy , insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day - long plasma insulin response may decrease .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Sitagliptin In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus , administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP - 4 enzyme activity for a 24 - hour period .
After an oral glucose load or a meal , this DPP - 4 inhibition resulted in a 2 - to 3 - fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP - 1 and GIP , decreased glucagon concentrations , and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose , resulting in higher C - peptide and insulin concentrations .
The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal .
In studies with healthy subjects , sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia .
Sitagliptin and Metformin Coadministration In a two - day study in healthy subjects , sitagliptin alone increased active GLP - 1 concentrations , whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP - 1 concentrations to similar extents .
Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP - 1 concentrations .
Sitagliptin , but not metformin , increased active GIP concentrations .
It is unclear what these findings mean for changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized , placebo - controlled crossover study , 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg , sitagliptin 800 mg ( 8 times the recommended dose ) , and placebo .
At the recommended dose of 100 mg , there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration , or at any other time during the study .
Following the 800 - mg dose , the maximum increase in the placebo - corrected mean change in QTc from baseline at 3 hours postdose was 8 . 0 msec .
This increase is not considered to be clinically significant .
At the 800 - mg dose , peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100 - mg dose .
In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg ( N = 81 ) or sitagliptin 200 mg ( N = 63 ) daily , there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Sitagliptin The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
Following a single oral 100 - mg dose to healthy volunteers , mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8 . 52 µM ∙ hr , C max was 950 nM , and apparent terminal half - life ( t 1 / 2 ) was 12 . 4 hours .
Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose - proportional manner and increased approximately 14 % following 100 mg doses at steady - state compared to the first dose .
The intra - subject and inter - subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small ( 5 . 8 % and 15 . 1 % ) .
The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
Absorption Sitagliptin After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects , sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations ( median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose .
The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87 % .
Effect of Food Coadministration of a high - fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin .
Metformin The absolute bioavailability of a metformin HCl 500 - mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50 - 60 % .
Studies using single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 500 mg to 1 , 500 mg , and 850 mg to 2 , 550 mg ( approximately 1 . 3 times the maximum recommended daily dosage ) , indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses , which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination .
Effect of Food Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin , as shown by approximately a 40 % lower mean peak plasma concentration ( C max ) , a 25 % lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve ( AUC ) , and a 35 - minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration ( T max ) following administration of a single 850 - mg tablet of metformin HCl with food , compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting .
The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown .
Distribution Sitagliptin The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100 - mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters .
The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low ( 38 % ) .
Metformin The apparent volume of distribution ( V / F ) of metformin following single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 850 mg averaged 654 ± 358 L . Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins , in contrast to sulfonylureas , which are more than 90 % protein bound .
Metformin partitions into erythrocytes , most likely as a function of time .
At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin HCl tablets , steady - state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24 - 48 hours and are generally < 1 mcg / mL .
Elimination Sitagliptin Approximately 79 % of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination .
The apparent terminal t 1 / 2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12 . 4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL / min .
Metformin Following oral administration , approximately 90 % of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours , with a plasma elimination half - life of approximately 6 . 2 hours .
In blood , the elimination half - life is approximately 17 . 6 hours , suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution .
Metabolism Sitagliptin Following a [ 14 C ] sitagliptin oral dose , approximately 16 % of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin .
Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP - 4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin .
In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4 , with contribution from CYP2C8 .
Metformin Intravenous single - dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism ( no metabolites have been identified in humans ) nor biliary excretion .
Excretion Sitagliptin Following administration of an oral [ 14 C ] sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects , approximately 100 % of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces ( 13 % ) or urine ( 87 % ) within one week of dosing .
Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion .
Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter - 3 ( hOAT - 3 ) , which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin .
The clinical relevance of hOAT - 3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established .
Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) , which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin .
However , cyclosporine , a P - gp inhibitor , did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin .
Metformin Elimination of metformin occurs primarily via renal excretion .
Renal clearance is approximately 3 . 5 times greater than creatinine clearance , which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination .
Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment JANUMET Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET in renally impaired patients have not been performed [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Sitagliptin An approximately 2 - fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL / min / 1 . 73 m 2 , and an approximately 4 - fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment including patients with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) on hemodialysis , as compared to normal healthy control subjects .
[ See Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) . ]
Metformin In patients with decreased renal function , the plasma and blood half - life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ; Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment JANUMET Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET in patients with hepatic impairment have not been performed .
Sitagliptin In patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh score 7 to 9 ) , mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21 % and 13 % , respectively , compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100 - mg dose of sitagliptin .
These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful .
There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh score > 9 ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Metformin No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment .
Effects of Age , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , Gender , and Race Sitagliptin Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data , BMI , gender , and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin .
When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account , age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis .
Elderly subjects ( 65 to 80 years ) had approximately 19 % higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects .
Metformin Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased , the half - life is prolonged , and C max is increased , compared to healthy young subjects .
From these data , it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function .
Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender .
Similarly , in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus , the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females .
No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed .
In controlled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus , the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Whites ( n = 249 ) , Blacks ( n = 51 ) , and Hispanics ( n = 24 ) .
Drug Interaction Studies JANUMET Coadministration of multiple doses of sitagliptin ( 50 mg ) and metformin HCl ( 1000 mg ) given twice daily did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either sitagliptin or metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes .
Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with JANUMET have not been performed ; however , such studies have been conducted with the individual components of JANUMET ( sitagliptin and metformin HCl ) .
Sitagliptin In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4 , 2C8 , 2C9 , 2D6 , 1A2 , 2C19 or 2B6 , and is not an inducer of CYP3A4 .
Sitagliptin is a P - gp substrate but does not inhibit P - gp mediated transport of digoxin .
Based on these results , sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways .
Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins .
Therefore , the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug - drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low .
In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies , sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin , glyburide , simvastatin , rosiglitazone , digoxin , warfarin , or an oral contraception ( ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone ) ( Table 5 ) , providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , P - gp , and organic cationic transporter ( OCT ) .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility JANUMET No animal studies have been conducted with the combined products in JANUMET to evaluate carcinogenesis , mutagenesis or impairment of fertility .
The following data are based on the findings in studies with sitagliptin and metformin individually .
Sitagliptin A two - year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50 , 150 , and 500 mg / kg / day .
There was an increased incidence of combined liver adenoma / carcinoma in males and females and of liver carcinoma in females at 500 mg / kg .
This dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose ( MRHD ) of 100 mg / day based on AUC comparisons .
Liver tumors were not observed at 150 mg / kg , approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD .
A two - year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50 , 125 , 250 , and 500 mg / kg / day .
There was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to 500 mg / kg , approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD .
Sitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay , a Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) chromosome aberration assay , an in vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO , an in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay , and an in vivo micronucleus assay .
In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125 , 250 , and 1000 mg / kg , males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating , during mating , up to scheduled termination ( approximately 8 weeks total ) , and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7 .
No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg / kg ( approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg / day based on AUC comparisons ) .
At higher doses , nondose - related increased resorptions in females were observed ( approximately 25 and 100 times human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison ) .
Metformin Long - term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats ( dosing duration of 104 weeks ) and mice ( dosing duration of 91 weeks ) at doses up to and including 900 mg / kg / day and 1500 mg / kg / day , respectively .
These doses are both approximately four times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons .
No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice .
Similarly , there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats .
There was , however , an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg / kg / day .
There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests : Ames test ( S . typhimurium ) , gene mutation test ( mouse lymphoma cells ) , or chromosomal aberrations test ( human lymphocytes ) .
Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative .
Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg / kg / day , which is approximately three times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin has been studied in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on diet and exercise and in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents .
None of the clinical efficacy studies described below was conducted with JANUMET ; however , bioequivalence of JANUMET with coadministered sitagliptin and metformin HCl tablets was demonstrated .
Sitagliptin and Metformin Coadministration in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Diet and Exercise A total of 1091 patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control on diet and exercise participated in a 24 - week , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled factorial study designed to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin and metformin coadministration .
Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent ( N = 541 ) underwent a diet , exercise , and drug washout period of up to 12 weeks duration .
After the washout period , patients with inadequate glycemic control ( A1C 7 . 5 % to 11 % ) were randomized after completing a 2 - week single - blind placebo run - in period .
Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry ( N = 550 ) with inadequate glycemic control ( A1C 7 . 5 % to 11 % ) immediately entered the 2 - week single - blind placebo run - in period and then were randomized .
Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive placebo , 100 mg of sitagliptin once daily , 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily , or 50 mg of sitagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily .
Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glyburide ( glibenclamide ) rescue .
Sitagliptin and metformin coadministration provided significant improvements in A1C , FPG , and 2 - hour PPG compared to placebo , to metformin alone , and to sitagliptin alone ( Table 9 , Figure 1 ) .
Mean reductions from baseline in A1C were generally greater for patients with higher baseline A1C values .
For patients not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry , mean reductions from baseline in A1C were : sitagliptin 100 mg once daily , - 1 . 1 % ; metformin HCl 500 mg bid , - 1 . 1 % ; metformin HCl 1000 mg bid , - 1 . 2 % ; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 500 mg bid , - 1 . 6 % ; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 1000 mg bid , - 1 . 9 % ; and for patients receiving placebo , - 0 . 2 % .
Lipid effects were generally neutral .
The decrease in body weight in the groups given sitagliptin in combination with metformin was similar to that in the groups given metformin alone or placebo .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] Sitagliptin Add - on Therapy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Metformin Alone A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24 - week , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin in combination with metformin .
Patients already on metformin ( N = 431 ) at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2 - week , single - blind placebo run - in period .
Patients on metformin and another antihyperglycemic agent ( N = 229 ) and patients not on any antihyperglycemic agents ( off therapy for at least 8 weeks , N = 41 ) were randomized after a run - in period of approximately 10 weeks on metformin HCl ( at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day ) in monotherapy .
Patients were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo , administered once daily .
Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue .
In combination with metformin , sitagliptin provided significant improvements in A1C , FPG , and 2 - hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin ( Table 10 ) .
Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5 % of patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 14 % of patients treated with placebo .
A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups .

Sitagliptin Add - on Therapy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on the Combination of Metformin and Glimepiride A total of 441 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24 - week , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin in combination with glimepiride , with or without metformin .
Patients entered a run - in treatment period on glimepiride ( ≥ 4 mg per day ) alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin HCl ( ≥ 1500 mg per day ) .
After a dose - titration and dose - stable run - in period of up to 16 weeks and a 2 - week placebo run - in period , patients with inadequate glycemic control ( A1C 7 . 5 % to 10 . 5 % ) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo , administered once daily .
Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue .
Patients receiving sitagliptin with metformin and glimepiride had significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to patients receiving placebo with metformin and glimepiride ( Table 11 ) , with mean reductions from baseline relative to placebo in A1C of - 0 . 9 % and in FPG of - 21 mg / dL .
Rescue therapy was used in 8 % of patients treated with add - on sitagliptin 100 mg and 29 % of patients treated with add - on placebo .
The patients treated with add - on sitagliptin had a mean increase in body weight of 1 . 1 kg vs . add - on placebo ( + 0 . 4 kg vs . - 0 . 7 kg ) .
In addition , add - on sitagliptin resulted in an increased rate of hypoglycemia compared to add - on placebo .

Sitagliptin Add - on Therapy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on the Combination of Metformin and Rosiglitazone A total of 278 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 54 - week , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin in combination with metformin and rosiglitazone .
Patients on dual therapy with metformin HCl ≥ 1500 mg / day and rosiglitazone ≥ 4 mg / day or with metformin HCl ≥ 1500 mg / day and pioglitazone ≥ 30 mg / day ( switched to rosiglitazone ≥ 4 mg / day ) entered a dose - stable run - in period of 6 weeks .
Patients on other dual therapy were switched to metformin HCl ≥ 1500 mg / day and rosiglitazone ≥ 4 mg / day in a dose titration / stabilization run - in period of up to 20 weeks in duration .
After the run - in period , patients with inadequate glycemic control ( A1C 7 . 5 % to 11 % ) were randomized 2 : 1 to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo , administered once daily .
Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with glipizide ( or other sulfonylurea ) rescue .
The primary time point for evaluation of glycemic parameters was Week 18 .
In combination with metformin and rosiglitazone , sitagliptin provided significant improvements in A1C , FPG , and 2 - hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin and rosiglitazone ( Table 12 ) at Week 18 .
At Week 54 , mean reduction in A1C was - 1 . 0 % for patients treated with sitagliptin and - 0 . 3 % for patients treated with placebo in an analysis based on the intent - to - treat population .
Rescue therapy was used in 18 % of patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 40 % of patients treated with placebo .
There was no significant difference between sitagliptin and placebo in body weight change .

Sitagliptin Add - on Therapy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on the Combination of Metformin and Insulin A total of 641 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24 - week , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin as add - on to insulin therapy .
Approximately 75 % of patients were also taking metformin .
Patients entered a 2 - week , single - blind run - in treatment period on pre - mixed , long - acting , or intermediate - acting insulin , with or without metformin HCl ( ≥ 1500 mg per day ) .
Patients using short - acting insulins were excluded unless the short - acting insulin was administered as part of a pre - mixed insulin .
After the run - in period , patients with inadequate glycemic control ( A1C 7 . 5 % to 11 % ) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin ( N = 229 ) or placebo ( N = 233 ) , administered once daily .
Patients were on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment with no changes in insulin dose permitted during the run - in period .
Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double - blind treatment period were to have uptitration of the background insulin dose as rescue therapy .
Among patients also receiving metformin , the median daily insulin ( pre - mixed , intermediate or long acting ) dose at baseline was 40 units in the sitagliptin - treated patients and 42 units in the placebo - treated patients .
The median change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was zero for both groups at the end of the study .
Patients receiving sitagliptin with metformin and insulin had significant improvements in A1C , FPG and 2 - hour PPG compared to patients receiving placebo with metformin and insulin ( Table 13 ) .
The adjusted mean change from baseline in body weight was - 0 . 3 kg in patients receiving sitagliptin with metformin and insulin and - 0 . 2 kg in patients receiving placebo with metformin and insulin .
There was an increased rate of hypoglycemia in patients treated with sitagliptin .

Maintenance of Sitagliptin During Initiation and Titration of Insulin Glargine A total of 746 patients with type 2 diabetes ( mean baseline HbA1C 8 . 8 % , disease duration 10 . 8 years ) participated in a 30 - week , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of continuing sitagliptin during the initiation and uptitration of insulin glargine .
Patients who were on a stable dose of metformin HCl ( ≥ 1500 mg / day ) in combination with a DPP - 4 inhibitor and / or sulfonylurea but with inadequate glycemic control ( A1C 7 . 5 % to 11 % ) were enrolled in the study .
Those on metformin and sitagliptin ( 100 mg / day ) directly entered the double - blind treatment period ; those on another DPP - 4 inhibitor and / or on a sulfonylurea entered a 4 - 8 week run - in period in which they were maintained on metformin and switched to sitagliptin ( 100 mg ) ; other DPP - 4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas were discontinued .
At randomization patients were randomized either to continue sitagliptin or to discontinue sitagliptin and switch to a matching placebo .
On the day of randomization , insulin glargine was initiated at a dose of 10 units subcutaneously in the evening .
Patients were instructed to uptitrate their insulin dose in the evening based on fasting blood glucose measurements to achieve a target of 72 - 100 mg / dL .
At 30 weeks , the mean reduction in A1C was greater in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group ( Table 14 ) .
At the end of the trial , 27 . 3 % of patients in the sitagliptin group and 27 . 3 % in the placebo group had a fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) in the target range ; there was no significant difference in insulin dose between arms .

Sitagliptin Add - on Therapy vs . Glipizide Add - on Therapy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Metformin The efficacy of sitagliptin was evaluated in a 52 - week , double - blind , glipizide - controlled noninferiority trial in patients with type 2 diabetes .
Patients not on treatment or on other antihyperglycemic agents entered a run - in treatment period of up to 12 weeks duration with metformin monotherapy ( dose of ≥ 1500 mg per day ) which included washout of medications other than metformin , if applicable .
After the run - in period , those with inadequate glycemic control ( A1C 6 . 5 % to 10 % ) were randomized 1 : 1 to the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or glipizide for 52 weeks .
Patients receiving glipizide were given an initial dosage of 5 mg / day and then electively titrated over the next 18 weeks to a maximum dosage of 20 mg / day as needed to optimize glycemic control .
Thereafter , the glipizide dose was to be kept constant , except for down - titration to prevent hypoglycemia .
The mean dose of glipizide after the titration period was 10 mg .
After 52 weeks , sitagliptin and glipizide had similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C in the intent - to - treat analysis ( Table 15 ) .
These results were consistent with the per protocol analysis ( Figure 2 ) .
A conclusion in favor of the non - inferiority of sitagliptin to glipizide may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those included in the study ( over 70 % of patients had baseline A1C less than 8 % and over 90 % had A1C less than 9 % ) .

The incidence of hypoglycemia in the sitagliptin group ( 4 . 9 % ) was significantly ( p < 0 . 001 ) lower than that in the glipizide group ( 32 . 0 % ) .
Patients treated with sitagliptin exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide ( - 1 . 5 kg vs . + 1 . 1 kg ) .
