8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no data regarding the presence of moxifloxacin in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infants , or the effects on milk production / excretion to inform risk of moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution to an infant during lactation .
A study in lactating rats has shown transfer of moxifloxacin into milk following oral administration .
Systemic levels of moxifloxacin following topical ocular administration are low [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] , and it is not known whether measurable levels of moxifloxacin would be present in maternal milk following topical ocular administration .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution have been established in all ages .
Use of moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution is supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies of moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in adults , children , and neonates [ see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14 ) ] .
There is no evidence that the ophthalmic administration of moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution has any effect on weight bearing joints , even though oral administration of some quinolones has been shown to cause arthropathy in immature animals .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients .
Moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution USP , 0 . 5 % is a sterile solution for topical ophthalmic use .
Moxifloxacin hydrochloride is an 8 - methoxy fluoroquinolone anti - infective , with a diazabicyclononyl ring at the C7 position .
The chemical name for moxifloxacin hydrochloride is 1 - Cyclopropyl - 6 - fluoro - 1 , 4 - dihydro - 8 - methoxy - 7 - [ ( 4 aS , 7 aS ) - octahydro - 6 H - pyrrolol [ 3 , 4 - b ] pyridin - 6 - yl ] - 4 - oxo - 3 - quinolinecarboxylic acid , monohydrochloride .
The molecular formula for moxifloxacin hydrochloride is C21H24FN3O4 • HCl and its molecular weight is 437 . 9 g / mol .
The chemical structure is presented below : [ Molecular Structure ] Moxifloxacin hydrochloride USP is a slightly yellow to yellow crystalline powder .
Each mL of moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution USP contains 5 . 45 mg moxifloxacin hydrochloride USP equivalent to 5 mg moxifloxacin base .
Moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution contains : Active : Moxifloxacin 0 . 5 % ( 5 mg / mL ) ; Inactives : Boric acid , sodium chloride and water for injection .
May also contain hydrochloric acid and / or sodium hydroxide to adjust pH to approximately 6 . 8 .
Moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution USP , 0 . 5 % is a yellow colored transparent isotonic solution with an osmolality of approximately 290 mOsm / kg .
12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Moxifloxacin is a member of the fluoroquinolone class of anti - infective drugs [ see MICROBIOLOGY ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Plasma concentrations of moxifloxacin were measured in healthy adult male and female subjects who received bilateral topical ocular doses of moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 3 times a day .
The mean steady - state Cmax ( 2 . 7 ng / mL ) and AUC0 to ∞ ( 41 . 9 ng • hr / mL ) values were 1600 and 1100 times lower than the mean Cmax and AUC reported after therapeutic 400 mg doses of moxifloxacin .
The plasma half - life of moxifloxacin was estimated to be 13 hours .
12 . 4 Microbiology The antibacterial action of moxifloxacin results from inhibition of the topoisomerase II ( DNA gyrase ) and topoisomerase IV .
DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme that is involved in the replication , transcription and repair of bacterial DNA .
Topoisomerase IV is an enzyme known to play a key role in the partitioning of the chromosomal DNA during bacterial cell division .
The mechanism of action for quinolones , including moxifloxacin , is different from that of macrolides , aminoglycosides , or tetracyclines .
Therefore , moxifloxacin may be active against pathogens that are resistant to these antibiotics and these antibiotics may be active against pathogens that are resistant to moxifloxacin .
There is no cross - resistance between moxifloxacin and the aforementioned classes of antibiotics .
Cross - resistance has been observed between systemic moxifloxacin and some other quinolones .
In vitro resistance to moxifloxacin develops via multiple - step mutations .
Resistance to moxifloxacin occurs in vitro at a general frequency of between 1 . 8 x 10 - 9 to less than 1 x 10 - 11 for gram - positive bacteria .
Moxifloxacin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the Indications and Usage section : Aerobic Gram - Positive Microorganisms Corynebacterium species * Micrococcus luteus * Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis Staphylococcus haemolyticus Staphylococcus hominis Staphylococcus warneri * Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus viridans group Aerobic Gram - Negative Microorganisms Acinetobacter lwoffii * Haemophilus influenza Haemophilus parainfluenzae * Other Microorganisms Chlamydia trachomatis * Efficacy for this organism was studied in fewer than 10 infections .
The following in vitro data are also available , but their clinical significance in ophthalmic infections is unknown .
The safety and effectiveness of moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in treating ophthalmological infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well - controlled trials .
The following organisms are considered susceptible when evaluated using systemic breakpoints .
However , a correlation between the in vitro systemic breakpoint and ophthalmological efficacy has not been established .
The list of organisms is provided as guidance only in assessing the potential treatment of conjunctival infections .
Moxifloxacin exhibits in vitro minimal inhibitory concentrations ( MICs ) of 2 microgram / mL or less ( systemic susceptible breakpoint ) against most ( greater than or equal to 90 % ) strains of the following ocular pathogens .
Aerobic Gram - Positive Microorganisms Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus saprophyticus Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus mitis Streptococcus pyogenes Streptococcus Group C , G , and F Aerobic Gram - Negative Microorganisms Acinetobacter baumannii Acinetobacter calcoaceticus Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Enterobacter aerogenes Enterobacter cloacae Escherichia coli Klebsiella oxytoca Klebsiella pneumoniae Moraxella catarrhalis Morganella morganii Neisseria gonorrhoeae Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Pseudomonas stutzeri Anaerobic Microorganisms Clostridium perfringens Fusobacterium species Prevotella species Propionibacterium acnes Other Microorganisms Chlamydia pneumoniae Legionella pneumophila Mycobacterium avium Mycobacterium marinum Mycoplasma pneumoniae 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long - term studies in animals to determine the carcinogenic potential of moxifloxacin have not been performed .
However , in an accelerated study with initiators and promoters , moxifloxacin was not carcinogenic in rats following up to 38 weeks of oral dosing at 500 mg / kg / day ( 3224 times the highest recommended total daily human ophthalmic dose for a 60 kg person , based on body surface area ) .
Mutagenesis Moxifloxacin was not mutagenic in four bacterial strains used in the Ames Salmonella reversion assay .
As with other quinolones , the positive response observed with moxifloxacin in strain TA 102 using the same assay may be due to the inhibition of DNA gyrase .
Moxifloxacin was not mutagenic in the CHO / HGPRT mammalian cell gene mutation assay .
An equivocal result was obtained in the same assay when V79 cells were used .
Moxifloxacin was clastogenic in the V79 chromosome aberration assay , but it did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in cultured rat hepatocytes .
There was no evidence of genotoxicity in vivo in a micronucleus test or a dominant lethal test in mice .
Impairment of Fertility Moxifloxacin had no effect on fertility in male and female rats at oral doses as high as 500 mg / kg / day , approximately 3224 times the highest recommended total daily human ophthalmic dose , based on body surface area .
At 500 mg / kg / day orally there were slight effects on sperm morphology ( head - tail separation ) in male rats and on the estrous cycle in female rats .
In two randomized , double - masked , multicenter , controlled clinical trials in which patients were dosed 3 times a day for 4 days , moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution produced clinical cures on Day 5 to 6 in 66 % to 69 % of patients treated for bacterial conjunctivitis .
Microbiological success rates for the eradication of baseline pathogens ranged from 84 % to 94 % .
In a randomized , double - masked , multicenter , parallel - group clinical trial of pediatric patients with bacterial conjunctivitis between birth and 31 days of age , patients were dosed with moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution or another anti - infective agent .
Clinical outcomes for the trial demonstrated a clinical cure rate of 80 % at Day 9 and a microbiological eradication success rate of 92 % at Day 9 .
Please note that microbiologic eradication does not always correlate with clinical outcome in anti - infective trials .
