MembraneBlue ™ 0 . 15 % ( trypan blue ophthalmic solution ) Initial U . S . Approval : 2004 • For use as an aid in ophthalmic posterior surgery ; • Facilitating removal of epiretinal tissue .
MembraneBlue 0 . 15 % - Dosage & administration section Make sure the plunger moves smoothly before use .
Prime the syringe prior to use by retracting the plunger before injecting the fluid .
Alternatively , twist the plunger into the stopper in a clockwise motion until tight .
Once tight , continue turning the plunger in a clockwise motion until the stopper rotates freely within the syringe , two or three rotations .
The syringe is now primed and suitable for injection .
Before injection of MembraneBlue ™ 0 . 15 % perform a ' fluid - air exchange ' , i . e . filling the entire vitreous cavity with air , to prevent aqeous dilution of MembraneBlue ™ 0 . 15 % .
MembraneBlue ™ 0 . 15 % is carefully applied to the retinal membrane using a blunt cannula attached to the MembraneBlue ™ 0 . 15 % syringe , without allowing the cannula to contact or damage the retina .
Sufficient staining is expected on contact with the membrane .
All excess dye should be removed from the vitreous cavity before performing an air - fluid exchange , to prevent unnecessary spreading of the dye .
MembraneBlue ™ 0 . 15 % can also be injected directly in a BSS filled vitreous cavity ( instead of injecting under air ) .
Clinical use demonstrated that , after complete vitreous and posterior hyaloid removal , sufficient staining is achieved after 30 seconds of application under BSS .
MembraneBlue ™ 0 . 15 % is intended to be applied directly on the areas where membranes could be present , staining any portion of the membrane which comes in contact with the dye .
The dye does not penetrate the membrane .
• Prior to injection of MembraneBlue ™ 0 . 15 % perform a ' fluid - air exchange ' ; Carefully apply MembraneBlue ™ 0 . 15 % to epiretinal membranes using a blunt cannula ; Remove all excess dye ; Or • Inject MembraneBlue ™ 0 . 15 % directly in a BSS filled - vitreous cavity ; Wait 30 seconds ; Remove all excess dye .

MembraneBlue ™ 0 . 15 % is contraindicated when a non - hydrated ( dry state ) , hydrophilic acrylic intraocular lens ( IOL ) is planned to be inserted into the eye .
The dye may be absorbed by the IOL and stain it .
Insertion of a non - hydrated ( dry state ) , hydrophilic acrylic intraocular lens ( IOL ) .
MembraneBlue 0 . 15 % - Warnings and precautions section Excessive staining : It is recommended that after inection all excess MembraneBlue ™ 0 . 15 % be immediately removed from the eye .
Priming of the syringe : Make sure the plunger moves smoothly before use : first retract the plunger or twist the plunger in a clockwise motion before injecting the fluid .
• Excessive staining : Excess MembraneBlue ™ 0 . 15 % should be removed from the eye immediately after staining .
• Priming of the syringe : make sure the plunger moves smoothly before use : first retract the plunger or twist the plunger in a clockwise motion before injecting the fluid .
MembraneBlue 0 . 15 % - Adverse reactions section .
Adverse reactions reported following use of MembraneBlue ™ 0 . 15 % include discoloration of high water content hydrogen intraocular lenses ( see Contraindications ) and inadvertent staining of the posterior lens capsule and vitreous face .
Staining of the posterior lens capsule or staining of the vitreous face is generally self limited , lasting up to one week .
• Discoloration of high water content hydrogen intraocular lenses ; • Inadvertent staining of the posterior lens capsule and vitreous face ; To report suspected adverse reactions contact Dutch Ophthalmic , USA at 1 - 800 - 75 - DUTCH or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch MembraneBlue 0 . 15 % - Use in specific populations section Trypan blue should not be given to pregnant women .
MembraneBlue 0 . 15 % - Pregnancy section .
Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category C . Trypan blue is teratogenic in rats , mice , rabbits , hamsters , dogs , guinea pigs , pigs , and chickens .
The majority of teratogenicity studies performed involve intravenous , intraperitoneal , or subcutaneous administration in the rat .
The teratogenic dose is 50 mg / kg as a single dose or 25 mg / kg / day during embryogenesis in the rat .
These doses are approximately 4 , 000 - and 2 , 000 - fold the maximum recommended human dose of 0 . 75 mg per injection based on a 60 kg person , assuming that the whole dose is completely absorved .
Characteristic anomalies included neural tube , cardiovascular , vertebral , tail , and eye defects .
Trypan blue also caused an increase in post - implantation mortality , and decreased fetal weight .
In the monkey , trypan blue caused abortions with single or two daily doses of 50 mg / kg between the 20 th to 25 th days of pregnancy , but no apparent increase in birth defects ( approximately 4 , 000 - fold maximum recommended human dose of 0 . 75 mg per injection , assuming total absorption ) .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Trypan blue should be given to a pregnant woman only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
MembraneBlue 0 . 15 % - Nursing mothers section It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when trypan blue is administered to a nursing woman .
MembraneBlue 0 . 15 % - Pediatric use section .
The safety and effectiveness of trypan blue have been established in pediatric patients .
use of trypan blue is supported by evidence from an adequate and well - controlled study in pediatric patients .
MembraneBlue 0 . 15 % - Geriatric use .
No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients .
