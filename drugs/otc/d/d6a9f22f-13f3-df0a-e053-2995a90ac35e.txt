[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Chlorzoxazone is a centrally - acting agent for painful musculoskeletal conditions .
Data available from animal experiments as well as human study indicate that chlorzoxazone acts primarily at the level of the spinal cord and subcortical areas of the brain where it inhibits multisynaptic reflex arcs involved in producing and maintaining skeletal muscle spasm of varied etiology .
The clinical result is a reduction of the skeletal muscle spasm with relief of pain and increased mobility of the involved muscles .
Blood levels of chlorzoxazone can be detected in people during the first 30 minutes and peak levels may be reached , in the majority of the subjects , in about 1 to 2 hours after oral administration of chlorzoxazone .
Chlorzoxazone is rapidly metabolized and is excreted in the urine , primarily in a conjugated form as the glucuronide .
Less than one percent of a dose of chlorzoxazone is excreted unchanged in the urine in 24 hours .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Chlorzoxazone is indicated as an adjunct to rest , physical therapy , and other measures for the relief of discomfort associated with acute , painful musculoskeletal conditions .
The mode of action of this drug has not been clearly identified , but may be related to its sedative properties .

The concomitant use of alcohol or other central nervous system depressants may have an additive effect .
Usage in Pregnancy : The safe use of chlorzoxazone has not been established with respect to the possible adverse effects upon fetal development .
Therefore , it should be used in women of childbearing potential only when , in the judgment of the physician , the potential benefits outweigh the possible risks .

Drowsiness , dizziness , light - headedness , malaise , or overstimulation may be noted by an occasional patient .
Rarely , allergic - type skin rashes , petechiae , or ecchymoses may develop during treatment .
Angioneurotic edema or anaphylactic reactions are extremely rare .

Rarely , a patient may note discoloration of the urine resulting from a phenolic metabolite of chlorzoxazone .
This finding is of no known clinical significance .

Treatment : Gastric lavage or induction of emesis should be carried out , followed by administration of activated charcoal .
Thereafter , treatment is entirely supportive .
If respirations are depressed , oxygen and artificial respiration should be employed and a patent airway assured by use of an oropharyngeal airway or endotracheal tube .
Hypotension may be counteracted by use of dextran , plasma , concentrated albumin or a vasopressor agent such as norepinephrine .
Cholinergic drugs or analeptic drugs are of no value and should not be used .
