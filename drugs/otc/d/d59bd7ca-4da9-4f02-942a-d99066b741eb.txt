The estrogen plus progestin substudy of the Women ' s Health Initiative ( WHI ) reported increased risks of myocardial infarction , stroke , invasive breast cancer , pulmonary emboli , and deep vein thrombosis in postmenopausal women ( 50 to 79 years of age ) during 5 . 6 years of treatment with oral conjugated estrogens ( CE 0 . 625 mg ) combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA 2 . 5 mg ) per day , relative to placebo .
( See CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS , Cardiovascular disorders and Malignant neoplasms , Breast cancer . )
The estrogen - alone substudy of the WHI reported increased risks of stroke and deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) in postmenopausal women ( 50 to 79 years of age ) during 6 . 8 years and 7 . 1 years , respectively , of treatment with oral conjugated estrogens ( CE 0 . 625 mg ) per day , relative to placebo .
( See CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS , Cardiovascular disorders . )
The Women ' s Health Initiative Memory Study ( WHIMS ) , a substudy of the WHI study , reported increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 4 years of treatment with CE 0 . 625 mg combined with MPA 2 . 5 mg and during 5 . 2 years of treatment with CE 0 . 625 mg alone , relative to placebo .
It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women .
( See CLINICAL STUDIES , WARNINGS , Dementia and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use . )
Other doses of oral conjugated estrogens with medroxyprogesterone acetate , and other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins were not studied in the WHI clinical trials and , in the absence of comparable data , these risks should be assumed to be similar .
Because of these trials , estrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman .

The structural formula of NETA is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics .
Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions , estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites , estrone and estriol , at the receptor level .
The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle , which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily , depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle .
After menopause , most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione , secreted by the adrenal cortex , to estrone by peripheral tissues .
Thus , estrone and the sulfate conjugated form , estrone sulfate , are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women .
Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen - responsive tissues .
To date , two estrogen receptors have been identified .
These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue .
Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins , luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , and follicle - stimulating hormone ( FSH ) through a negative feedback mechanism .
Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women .
Progestin compounds enhance cellular differentiation and generally oppose the actions of estrogens by decreasing estrogen receptor levels , increasing local metabolism of estrogens to less active metabolites , or inducing gene products that blunt cellular responses to estrogen .
Progestins exert their effects in target cells by binding to specific progesterone receptors that interact with progesterone response elements in target genes .
Progesterone receptors have been identified in the female reproductive tract , breast , pituitary , hypothalamus , and central nervous system .
Progestins produce similar endometrial changes to those of the naturally occurring hormone progesterone .
PHARMACOKINETICS A . Absorption Estradiol is well absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract .
Following oral administration of Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate tablets , peak plasma estradiol concentrations are reached slowly within 5 - 8 hours .
When given orally , estradiol is extensively metabolized ( first - pass effect ) to estrone sulfate , with smaller amounts of other conjugated and unconjugated estrogens .
After oral administration , norethindrone acetate is rapidly absorbed and transformed to norethindrone .
It undergoes first - pass metabolism in the liver and other enteric organs , and reaches a peak plasma concentration within 0 . 5 - 1 . 5 hours after the administration of Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate tablets .
The oral bioavailability of estradiol and norethindrone following administration of Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg when compared to a combination oral solution is 53 % and 100 % , respectively .
Administration of Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg with food did not modify the bioavailability of estradiol , although increases in AUC0 - 72 of 19 % and decreases in Cmax of 36 % for norethindrone were seen .
The pharmacokinetic parameters of estradiol ( E2 ) , estrone ( E1 ) , and norethindrone ( NET ) following oral administration of 1 Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg or 2 Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate 0 . 5 mg / 0 . 1 mg tablet ( s ) to healthy postmenopausal women are summarized in Table 1 .

Distribution The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens .
Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs .
Estradiol circulates in the blood bound to sex - hormone - binding globulin ( SHBG ) ( 37 % ) and to albumin ( 61 % ) , while only approximately 1 - 2 % is unbound .
Norethindrone also binds to a similar extent to SHBG ( 36 % ) and to albumin ( 61 % ) .
C . Metabolism Estradiol Exogenous estrogens are metabolized in the same manner as endogenous estrogens .
Circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions .
These transformations take place mainly in the liver .
Estradiol is converted reversibly to estrone , and both can be converted to estriol , which is the major urinary metabolite .
Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver , biliary secretion of conjugates into the intestine , and hydrolysis in the intestine followed by reabsorption .
In postmenopausal women , a significant proportion of the circulating estrogens exist as sulfate conjugates , especially estrone sulfate , which serves as a circulating reservoir for the formation of more active estrogens .
Norethindrone Acetate The most important metabolites of norethindrone are isomers of 5α - dihydro - norethindrone and tetrahydro - norethindrone , which are excreted mainly in the urine as sulfate or glucuronide conjugates .
D . Excretion Estradiol , estrone , and estriol are excreted in the urine along with glucuronide and sulfate conjugates .
The half - life of estradiol following single dose administration of Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg is 12 - 14 hours .
The terminal half - life of norethindrone is about 8 - 11 hours .
E . Special Populations No pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in special populations , including patients with renal or hepatic impairment .
F . Drug Interactions Coadministration of estradiol with norethindrone acetate did not elicit any apparent influence on the pharmacokinetics of norethindrone .
Similarly , no relevant interaction of norethindrone on the pharmacokinetics of estradiol was found within the NETA dose range investigated in a single dose study .
In - vitro and in - vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) .
Therefore , inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism .
Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St . John ' s Wort preparations ( Hypericum perforatum ) , phenobarbital , carbamazepine , and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens , possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and / or changes in the uterine bleeding profile .
Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin , clarithromycin , ketoconazole , itraconazole , ritonavir and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and result in side effects .
CLINICAL STUDIES Effects on Vasomotor Symptoms In a 12 - week randomized clinical trial involving 92 subjects , Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg was compared to 1 mg of estradiol and to placebo .
The mean number and intensity of hot flushes were significantly reduced from baseline to week 4 and 12 in both the Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg and the 1 mg estradiol group compared to placebo ( see Figure 2 ) .
Figure 2 Mean Weekly Number of Moderate and Severe Hot Flushes in a 12 - Week Study [ MULTIMEDIA ] In a study conducted in Europe a total of 577 postmenopausal women were randomly assigned to either Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 0 . 5 mg / 0 . 1 mg , 0 . 5 mg E2 / 0 . 25 mg NETA , or placebo for 24 weeks of treatment .
The mean number and severity of hot flushes were significantly reduced at week 4 and week 12 in the Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 0 . 5 mg / 0 . 1 mg ( see Figure 3 ) and 0 . 5 mg E2 / 0 . 25 mg NETA groups compared to placebo .

This trial enrolled 1 , 176 subjects who were randomized to one of 4 arms : 1 mg estradiol unopposed ( n = 296 ) , 1 mg E2 + 0 . 1 mg NETA ( n = 294 ) , 1 mg E2 + 0 . 25 mg NETA ( n = 291 ) , and Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg ( n = 295 ) .
At the end of the study , endometrial biopsy results were available for 988 subjects .
The results of the 1 mg estradiol unopposed arm compared to Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg are shown in Table 2 .

While Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 0 . 5 mg / 0 . 1 mg was not directly studied in these trials , the US trial showed that addition of NETA to estradiol enhances the effect on BMD , therefore the BMD changes expected from treatment with Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 0 . 5 mg / 0 . 1 mg should be at least as great as observed with estradiol 0 . 5 mg .
A total of 462 postmenopausal women with intact uteri and baseline BMD values for lumbar spine within 2 standard deviations of the mean in healthy young women were enrolled .
In a US trial , 327 postmenopausal women ( mean time from menopause 2 . 5 to 3 . 1 years ) with a mean age of 53 years were randomized to 7 groups ( 0 . 25 mg , 0 . 5 mg , and 1 mg of estradiol alone , 1 mg estradiol with 0 . 25 mg norethindrone acetate , 1 mg estradiol with 0 . 5 mg norethindrone acetate , and 2 mg estradiol with 1 mg norethindrone acetate , and placebo . )
In a European trial ( EU trial ) , 135 postmenopausal women ( mean time from menopause 8 . 4 to 9 . 3 years ) with a mean age of 58 years were randomized to 1 mg estradiol with 0 . 25 mg norethindrone acetate , 1 mg estradiol with 0 . 5 mg norethindrone acetate , and placebo .
Approximately 58 % and 67 % of the randomized subjects in the two clinical trials , respectively , completed the two clinical trials .
BMD was measured using dual - energy x - ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) .
A summary of the results comparing Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg and estradiol 0 . 5 mg to placebo from the two prevention trials is shown in Table 3 .

[ 2 ] Significantly ( p < 0 . 001 ) different from placebo The overall difference in mean percentage change in BMD at the lumbar spine in the US trial ( 1000 mg / day calcium ) between Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg and placebo was 5 . 9 % and between estradiol 0 . 5 mg and placebo was 4 . 4 % .
In the European trial ( 500 mg / day calcium ) , the overall difference in mean percentage change in BMD at the lumbar spine was 6 . 3 % .
Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg and estradiol 0 . 5 mg also increased BMD at the femoral neck and femoral trochanter compared to placebo .

The suppression of bone turnover markers was evident by 3 months and persisted throughout the 24 - month treatment period .
Treatment with 0 . 5 mg estradiol decreased biochemical markers of bone resorption ( urinary pyridinoline , urinary deoxypyridinoline ) and bone formation ( bone - specific alkaline phosphatase ) compared to placebo .
These decreases occurred by 6 months of treatment after which the levels were maintained throughout the 24 months .
Women ' s Health Initiative Studies The WHI enrolled a total of 27 , 000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two substudies to assess the risks and benefits of either the use of oral conjugated estrogens ( CE 0 . 625 mg per day ) alone or the use of oral conjugated estrogens ( CE 0 . 625 mg ) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA 2 . 5 mg per day ) compared to placebo in the prevention of certain chronic diseases .
The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) ( nonfatal myocardial infarction ( MI ) , silent MI and CHD death ) , with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome studied .
A " global index " included the earliest occurrence of CHD , invasive breast cancer , stroke , pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , endometrial cancer , colorectal cancer , hip fracture , or death due to other cause .
The study did not evaluate the effects of CE or CE / MPA on menopausal symptoms .
The estrogen - plus - progestin substudy was stopped early .
According to the predefined stopping rule , after an average follow - up of 5 . 2 years of treatment , the increased risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the " global index . "
The absolute excess risk of events included in the " global index " was 19 per 10 , 000 women - years ( RR 1 . 15 , 95 % nCI 1 . 03 - 1 . 28 ) .
For those outcomes included in the WHI " global index , " that reached statistical significance after 5 . 6 years of follow - up , the absolute excess risks per 10 , 000 women - years in the group treated with CE / MPA were six more CHD events , seven more strokes , ten more PEs , and eight more invasive breast cancers , while the absolute risk reductions per 10 , 000 women - years were seven fewer colorectal cancers and five fewer hip fractures .

Final adjudicated results for CHD events from the estrogen - alone substudy , after an average follow - up of 7 . 1 years , reported no overall difference for primary CHD events ( nonfatal MI , silent MI and CHD death ) in women receiving CE alone compared with placebo ( see Table 5 ) .
Women ' s Health Initiative Memory Study The estrogen plus progestin Women ' s Health Initiative Memory Study ( WHIMS ) substudy of WHI enrolled 4 , 532 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older ( 47 % , age 65 to 69 years , 35 % , age 70 to 74 years , 18 % , 75 years of age and older ) to evaluate the effects of CE 0 . 625 mg plus MPA 2 . 5 mg daily on the incidence of probable dementia ( primary outcome ) compared with placebo .
After an average follow - up of four years , 40 women in the estrogen - plus - progestin group ( 45 per 10 , 000 women - years ) and 21 in the placebo group ( 22 per 10 , 000 women - years ) were diagnosed with probable dementia .
The relative risk of probable dementia in the hormone therapy group was 2 . 05 ( 95 % CI , 1 . 21 - 3 . 48 ) compared to placebo .
It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women .
( See BOXED WARNINGS , WARNINGS , Dementia , and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use . )
The estrogen - alone WHIMS , a substudy of the WHI study , enrolled 2 , 947 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women 65 years of age and older ( 45 % , age 65 to 69 years , 36 % , age 70 to 74 years , 19 % , 75 years of age and older ) to evaluate the effects of conjugated estrogens ( CE 0 . 625 mg ) on the incidence of probable dementia ( primary outcome ) compared with placebo .
After an average follow - up of 5 . 2 years , 28 women in the estrogen - alone group ( 37 per 10 , 000 women - years ) and 19 in the placebo group ( 25 per 10 , 000 women - years ) were diagnosed with probable dementia .
The relative risk of probable dementia in the estrogen - alone group was 1 . 49 ( 95 % CI 0 . 83 - 2 . 66 ) compared to placebo .
When data from the two populations were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol , the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1 . 76 ( 95 % CI 1 . 19 - 2 . 60 ) .
Differences between groups became apparent in the first year of treatment .
It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women .
( See BOXED WARNINGS , WARNINGS , Dementia , and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use . )
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg and 0 . 5 mg / 0 . 1 mg are indicated in women who have a uterus for the : • Treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause .
• Prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis .
When prescribing solely for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis , therapy should only be considered for women at significant risk of osteoporosis and non - estrogen medications should be carefully considered .
The mainstays for decreasing the risk of postmenopausal osteoporosis are weight bearing exercise , adequate calcium and vitamin D intake , and when indicated , pharmacologic therapy .
Postmenopausal women require an average of 1500 mg / day of elemental calcium .
Therefore , when not contraindicated , calcium supplementation may be helpful for women with suboptimal dietary intake .
Vitamin D supplementation of 400 - 800 IU / day may also be required to ensure adequate daily intake in postmenopausal women .
Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg is also indicated in women who have a uterus for the : • 3 .
Treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with menopause .
When used solely for the treatment of symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy , topical vaginal products should be considered .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets should not be used in women with any of the following conditions : • Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding .
• Known , suspected , or history of cancer of the breast .
• Known or suspected estrogen - dependent neoplasia .
• Active deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , or history of these conditions .
• Active or recent ( e . g . , within the past year ) arterial thromboembolic disease ( e . g . , stroke , myocardial infarction ) .
• Liver dysfunction or disease .
• Known hypersensitivity to the ingredients of Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg or Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 0 . 5 mg / 0 . 1 mg .
• Known or suspected pregnancy .
There is no indication for Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets in pregnancy .
There appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in children born to women who have used estrogens and progestins from oral contraceptives inadvertently during early pregnancy .
( See PRECAUTIONS . )
WARNINGS See BOXED WARNINGS .
1 .
Cardiovascular disorders Estrogen - plus - progestin therapy has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction as well as stroke , venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism .
Estrogen - alone therapy has been associated with an increased risk of stroke and deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) .
Should any of these events occur or be suspected , estrogens should be discontinued immediately .
Risk factors for arterial vascular disease ( e . g . , hypertension , diabetes mellitus , tobacco use , hypercholesterolemia , and obesity ) and / or venous thromboembolism ( e . g . , personal history or family history of VTE , obesity , and systemic lupus erythematosus ) should be managed appropriately .
a . Stroke In the estrogen plus progestin substudy of the Women ' s Health Initiative ( WHI ) , a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women receiving CE / MPA 0 . 625 mg / 2 . 5 mg daily compared to women receiving placebo ( 31 vs . 24 per 10 , 000 women - years ) .
The increase in risk was demonstrated after the first year and persisted .
( See CLINICAL STUDIES . )
In the estrogen - alone substudy of the WHI , a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women receiving CE 0 . 625 mg daily compared to women receiving placebo ( 44 vs . 32 per 10 , 000 women - years ) .
The increase in risk was demonstrated in year one and persisted .
b . Coronary heart disease In the estrogen - plus progestin sub - study of WHI , no statistically significant increase in CHD events ( defined as non - fatal , MI , silent MI , or death , due to CHD ) was reported in women receiving CE / MPA compared to women receiving placebo ( 39 vs . 33 per 10 , 000 women years ) .
An increase in relative risk was demonstrated in year one , and a trend toward decreasing relative risk was reported in years 2 through 5 .
( See CLINICAL STUDIES . )
In the estrogen - alone substudy of WHI , no overall effect on coronary disease ( CHD ) events was reported in women receiving estrogen alone compared to placebo .
( See CLINICAL STUDIES . )
In postmenopausal women with documented heart disease ( n = 2 , 763 , average age 66 . 7 years ) , a controlled clinical trial of secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease ( Heart and Estrogen / Progestin Replacement Study ( HERS ) ) treatment with CE / MPA ( 0 . 625 mg / 2 . 5 mg per day ) demonstrated no cardiovascular benefit .
During an average follow - up of 4 . 1 years , treatment with CE / MPA did not reduce the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established coronary heart disease .
There were more CHD events in the CE / MPA - treated group than in the placebo group in year 1 , but not during the subsequent years .
Participation in an open - label extension of the original HERS trial ( HERS II ) was agreed to by 2 , 321 women .
Average follow - up in HERS II was an additional 2 . 7 years , for a total of 6 . 8 years overall .
Rates of CHD events were comparable among women in the CE / MPA group and the placebo group in HERS , HERS II , and overall .
Large doses of estrogen ( 5 mg conjugated estrogens per day ) , comparable to those used to treat cancer of the prostate and breast , have been shown in a large prospective clinical trial in men to increase the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction , pulmonary embolism , and thrombophlebitis .
c . Venous thromboembolism In the estrogen - plus - progestin substudy of the Women ' s Health Initiative ( WHI ) , a statistically significant 2 - fold greater rate of VTE ( DVT and pulmonary embolism [ PE ] ) , was reported in women receiving CE / MPA compared to women receiving placebo ( 35 vs . 17 per 10 , 000 women - years ) .
Statistically significant increases in risk for both DVT ( 26 vs . 13 per 10 , 000 women - years ) and PE ( 18 vs . 8 per 10 , 000 women - years ) were also demonstrated .
The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first year and persisted .
( See CLINICAL STUDIES . )
In the estrogen - alone substudy of WHI , the risk of VTE was reported to be increased for women taking conjugated estrogens ( 30 vs . 22 per 10 , 000 women - years ) , although only the increased risk of DVT reached statistical significance ( 23 vs . 15 per 10 , 000 women - years ) .
The increase in VTE risk was demonstrated during the first two years .
If feasible , estrogens should be discontinued at least 4 to 6 weeks before surgery of the type associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism , or during periods of prolonged immobilization .
2 .
Malignant neoplasms a . Breast cancer In some studies , the use of estrogens and progestins by postmenopausal women has been reported to increase the risk of breast cancer .
The most important randomized clinical trial providing information about this issue is the CE / MPA substudy of the WHI study ( see CLINICAL STUDIES ) .
The results from observational studies are generally consistent with those of the WHI clinical trial .
Observational studies have also reported an increased risk of breast cancer for estrogen - plus - progestin combination therapy , and a smaller increased risk for estrogen - alone therapy , after several years of use .
For both findings , the excess risk increased with duration of use , and appeared to return to baseline over about five years after stopping treatment ( only the observational studies have substantial data on risk after stopping ) .
In these studies , the risk of breast cancer was greater , and became apparent earlier , with estrogen - plus - progestin combination therapy as compared to estrogen - alone therapy .
However , these studies have not found significant variation in the risk of breast cancer among different estrogens or among different estrogen - plus - progestin combinations , doses , or routes of administration .
In the estrogen - plus - progestin substudy , after a mean follow - up of 5 . 6 years , the WHI substudy reported an increased risk of breast cancer .
In this substudy , prior use of estrogen alone or estrogen - plus - progestin combination hormone therapy was reported by 26 % of the women .
The relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1 . 24 ( 95 % nCI 1 . 01 - 1 . 54 ) , and the absolute risk was 41 vs 33 cases per 10 , 000 women - years , for estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo , respectively .
Among women who reported prior use of hormone therapy , the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1 . 86 , and the absolute risk was 46 vs . 25 cases per 10 , 000 women - years , for estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo .
Among women who reported no prior use of hormone therapy , the relative risk of invasive breast cancer was 1 . 09 , and the absolute risk was 40 vs . 36 cases per 10 , 000 women - years of estrogen plus progestin compared with placebo .
In the WHI trial , invasive breast cancers were larger and diagnosed at a more advanced stage in the estrogen - plus - progestin group compared with the placebo group .
Metastatic disease was rare , with no apparent difference between the two groups .
Other prognostic factors , such as histologic subtype , grade and hormone receptor status did not differ between the groups .
In the estrogen - alone substudy of WHI , after an average of 7 . 1 years of follow - up , CE ( 0 . 625 mg daily ) was not associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer ( RR 0 . 80 , 95 % nCI 0 . 62 - 1 . 04 ) .
In a one - year trial among 1 , 176 women who received either unopposed 1 mg estradiol or a combination of 1 mg estradiol plus one of three different doses of NETA ( 0 . 1 , 0 . 25 , and 0 . 5 mg ) , seven new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed , two of which occurred among the group of 295 women treated with Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg and two of which occurred among the group of 294 women treated with 1 mg estradiol / 0 . 1 mg NETA .
The use of estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin has been reported to result in an increase in abnormal mammograms requiring further evaluation .
All women should receive yearly breast examinations by a health care provider and perform monthly breast self - examinations .
In addition , mammography examinations should be scheduled based on patient age , risk factors , and prior mammogram results .
b . Endometrial cancer The use of unopposed estrogens in women with intact uteri has been associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer .
The reported endometrial cancer risk among unopposed estrogen users is about 2 - to 12 - fold greater than in nonusers , and appears dependent on duration of treatment and on estrogen dose .
Most studies show no significant increased risk associated with use of estrogens for less than one year .
The greatest risk appears associated with prolonged use , with an increased risk of 15 - to 24 - fold for five to ten years or more .
This risk has been shown to persist for at least 8 to 15 years after estrogen therapy is discontinued .
Clinical surveillance of all women taking estrogen / progestin combinations is important .
Adequate diagnostic measures , including endometrial sampling when indicated , should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in all cases of undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal vaginal bleeding .
There is no evidence that the use of natural estrogens results in a different endometrial risk profile than synthetic estrogens of equivalent estrogen dose .
Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia , which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer .
Endometrial hyperplasia ( a possible precursor of endometrial cancer ) has been reported to occur in approximately 1 % or less with Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets in one large clinical trial .
3 .
Dementia In the estrogen - plus - progestin Women ' s Health Initiative Memory Study ( WHIMS ) , a substudy of WHI , a population of 4 , 532 postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years was randomized to CE / MPA ( 0 . 625 mg / 2 . 5 mg daily ) or placebo .
In the estrogen - alone WHIMS substudy , a population of 2 , 947 hysterectomized women , aged 65 to 79 years , was randomized to CE ( 0 . 625 mg daily ) or placebo .
In the estrogen - plus - progestin substudy , after an average follow - up of four years , 40 women in the estrogen - plus - progestin group and 21 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia .
The relative risk of probable dementia for estrogen plus progestin vs . placebo was 2 . 05 ( 95 % CI 1 . 21 - 3 . 48 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE / MPA vs . placebo was 45 vs . 22 cases per 10 , 000 women - years .
In the estrogen - alone substudy , after an average follow - up of 5 . 2 years , 28 women in the estrogen - alone group and 19 women in the placebo group were diagnosed with probable dementia .
The relative risk of probable dementia for CE alone vs . placebo was 1 . 49 ( 95 % CI 0 . 83 - 2 . 66 ) .
The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE alone vs . placebo was 37 vs . 25 cases per 10 , 000 women - years .
When data from the two populations were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol , the reported overall relative risk of probable dementia was 1 . 76 ( 95 % CI 1 . 19 - 2 . 60 ) .
Since both substudies were conducted in women ages 65 to 79 , it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women .
( See BOXED WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS , Geriatric Use . )
4 .
Gallbladder disease A two - to four - fold increase in the risk of gallbladder disease requiring surgery in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens has been reported .
5 .
Hypercalcemia Estrogen administration may lead to severe hypercalcemia in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases .
If hypercalcemia occurs , use of the drug should be stopped and appropriate measures taken to reduce the serum calcium level .
6 .
Visual abnormalities Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in patients receiving estrogens .
Discontinue medication pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision , or a sudden onset of proptosis , diplopia , or migraine .
If examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions , estrogens should be permanently discontinued .
PRECAUTIONS A . General 1 .
Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy .
Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration , or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen , have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone .
Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer .
There are , however , possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen - alone treatment .
These include a possible increased risk of breast cancer .
2 .
Elevated blood pressure In a small number of case reports , substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens .
In a large , randomized , placebo - controlled clinical trial , a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen .
Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen use .
3 .
Hypertriglyceridemia In patients with pre - existing hypertriglyceridemia , estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis and other complications .
4 .
Impaired liver function and past history of cholestatic jaundice Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function .
For patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy , caution should be exercised , and in the case of recurrence , medication should be discontinued .
5 .
Hypothyroidism Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid - binding globulin ( TBG ) levels .
Patients with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone , thus maintaining free T4 and T3 serum concentrations in the normal range .
Patients dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogen may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy .
These patients should have their thyroid function monitored to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range .
6 .
Fluid retention Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention .
Because of this , patients who have conditions that might be influenced by this factor , such as a cardiac or renal dysfunction , warrant careful observation when estrogens are prescribed .
7 .
Hypocalcemia Estrogens should be used with caution in individuals with severe hypocalcemia .
8 .
Ovarian cancer The estrogen - plus - progestin substudy of WHI reported that after an average follow - up of 5 . 6 years , the relative risk for ovarian cancer for estrogen plus progestin vs . placebo was 1 . 58 ( 95 % CI 0 . 77 – 3 . 24 ) , but was not statistically significant .
The absolute risk for estrogen plus progestin vs . placebo was 4 . 2 vs . 2 . 7 cases per 10 , 000 women - years .
In some epidemiologic studies , the use of estrogen - only products , in particular for 10 or more years , has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer .
Other epidemiologic studies have not found these associations .
9 .
Exacerbation of endometriosis Endometriosis may be exacerbated with administration of estrogens .
Malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants has been reported in women treated post - hysterectomy with estrogen - alone therapy .
For patients known to have residual endometriosis post - hysterectomy , the addition of progestin should be considered .
10 .
Exacerbation of other conditions Estrogens may cause an exacerbation of asthma , diabetes mellitus , epilepsy , migraine or porphyria , systemic lupus erythematosus , and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions .
B . Patient Information Physicians are advised to discuss the contents of the Patient Information leaflet with patients for whom they prescribe Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg or Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 0 . 5 mg / 0 . 1 mg .
C . Laboratory Tests Estrogen administration should be initiated at the lowest dose approved for the indication and then guided by clinical response , rather than by serum hormone levels ( e . g . , estradiol , FSH ) .
D . Drug / laboratory Test Interactions • Accelerated prothrombin time , partial thromboplastin time , and platelet aggregation time ; increased platelet count ; increased factors II , VII antigen , VIII coagulant activity , IX , X , XII , VII - X complex , and beta - thromboglobulin ; decreased levels of anti - factor Xa and antithrombin III , decreased antithrombin III activity , increased levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen activity ; increased Plasminogen antigen and activity .
• Increased thyroid - binding globulin ( TBG ) levels leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone levels as measured by protein - bound iodine ( PBI ) , T4 levels ( by column or by radioimmunoassay ) , or T3 levels by radioimmunoassay .
T3 resin uptake is decreased , reflecting the elevated TBG .
Free T4 and free T3 concent - rations are unaltered .
Patients on thyroid replacement therapy may require higher doses of thyroid hormone .
• Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum ( i . e . , corticosteroid binding globulin ( CBG ) , SHBG ) leading to increased total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids , respectively .
Free hormone concentrations may be decreased .
Other plasma proteins may be increased ( angiotensinogen / rennin substrate , alpha - 1 antitrypsin , ceruloplasmin ) .
• Increased plasma HDL and HDL2 cholesterol subfraction concentration , reduced LDL cholesterol concentration , increased triglyceride levels .
• Impaired glucose tolerance .
• Reduced response to metyrapone test .
E . Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term continuous administration of estrogen , with or without progestin , in women with or without a uterus , has shown an increased risk of endometrial cancer , breast cancer , and ovarian cancer .
( See BOXED WARNINGS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS . )
Long - term continuous administration of natural and synthetic estrogens in certain animal species increases the frequency of carcinomas of the breast , uterus , cervix , vagina , testis , and liver .
F . Pregnancy Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate should not be used during pregnancy .
( See CONTRAINDICATIONS . )
G . Nursing Mothers Estrogen administration to nursing mothers has been shown to decrease the quantity and quality of breast milk .
Detectable amounts of estrogens have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving this drug .
Caution should be exercised when Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate is administered to a nursing mother .
H . Pediatric Use Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets are not indicated in children I . Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets did not include sufficient number of subjects aged 65 and over to determine if they responded differently from younger subjects .
Of the total number of subjects in the estrogen - plus - progestin substudy of the Women ' s Health Initiative ( WHI ) study , 44 % ( n = 7 , 320 ) were 65 - 74 years of age , while 6 . 6 % ( n = 1 , 095 ) were 75 years and over .
There was a higher relative risk ( CE / MPA vs . placebo ) of non - fatal stroke and invasive breast cancer in women 75 and over compared to women less than 75 years of age .
In women greater than 75 , the increased risk of non - fatal stroke and invasive breast cancer observed in the estrogen - plus - progestin combination group compared to the placebo group was 75 vs . 24 per 10 , 000 women - years and 52 vs . 12 per 10 , 000 women - years , respectively .
In the estrogen - plus - progestin Women ' s Health Initiative Memory Study ( WHIMS ) , a substudy of WHI , a population of 4 , 532 hysterectomized women , aged 65 to 79 years , was randomized to CE / MPA ( 0 . 625 mg / 2 . 5 mg daily ) or placebo .
In the estrogen - plus - progestin group , after an average follow - up of four years , the relative risk ( CE / MPA vs . placebo ) of probable dementia was 2 . 05 ( 95 % CI 1 . 21 - 3 . 48 ) .
The absolute risk of developing probable dementia with CE / MPA was 45 vs . 22 cases per 10 , 000 women - years with placebo .
Of the total number of subjects in the estrogen - alone substudy of WHI , 46 % ( n = 4 , 943 ) were 65 years and over , while 7 . 1 % ( n = 767 ) were 75 years and over .
There was a higher relative risk ( CE vs . placebo ) of stroke in women less than 75 years of age compared to women 75 years and over .
In the estrogen - alone WHIMS substudy , a population of 2 , 947 hysterectomized women , aged 65 to 79 years , was randomized to CE ( 0 . 625 mg daily ) or placebo .
After an average follow - up of 5 . 2 years , the relative risk ( CE vs . placebo ) of probable dementia was 1 . 49 ( 95 % CI 0 . 83 - 2 . 66 ) .
The absolute risk of developing probable dementia with estrogen alone was 37 vs . 25 cases per 10 , 000 women - years with placebo .
Seventy - nine percent of the cases of probable dementia occurred in women that were older than 70 for the CE - alone group , and 82 percent of the cases of probable dementia occurred in women who were older than 70 in the CE / MPA group .
The most common classification of probable dementia in both the treatment groups and placebo groups was Alzheimer ' s disease .
When data from the two populations were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol , the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1 . 76 ( 95 % CI 1 . 19 - 2 . 60 ) .
Since both substudies were conducted in women aged 65 to 79 years , it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women .

ADVERSE REACTIONS See BOXED WARNINGS , WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS .
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does , however , provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates .
Adverse events reported with Estradiol / Norethindrone Acetate Tablets 1 . 0 mg / 0 . 5 mg by investigators in the Phase 3 studies regardless of causality assessment are shown in Table 6 .
