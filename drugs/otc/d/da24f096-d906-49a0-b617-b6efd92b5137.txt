[ MULTIMEDIA ] 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE FLUORESCITE ® Injection 10 % is indicated in diagnostic fluorescein angiography or angioscopy of the retina and iris vasculature .
FLUORESCITE ® Injection 10 % is indicated in diagnostic fluorescein angiography or angioscopy of the retina and iris vasculature .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The normal adult dose of FLUORESCITE ® Injection 10 % ( 100 mg / mL ) is 500 mg via intravenous administration .
( 2 . 1 ) For children , the dose should be calculated on the basis of 7 . 7 mg for each kg of actual body weight ( or 35 mg for each 10 pounds of body weight ) up to a maximum of 500 mg via intravenous administration .
( 2 . 1 ) 2 . 1 Dosing Adult Dose - The normal adult dose of FLUORESCITE ® Injection 10 % ( 100 mg / mL ) is 500 mg via intravenous administration .
For children , the dose should be calculated on the basis of 7 . 7 mg for each kg of actual body weight ( or 35 mg for each 10 pounds of body weight ) up to a maximum of 500 mg via intravenous administration .
2 . 2 Preparation for Administration Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration .
Do not mix or dilute with other solutions or drugs .
Flush intravenous cannulas before and after drugs are injected to avoid physical incompatibility reactions .
2 . 3 Administration Inject the dose rapidly ( 1 mL per second is normally recommended ) intravenously into the antecubital vein , after taking precautions to avoid extravasation .
A syringe , filled with FLUORESCITE ® , may be attached to transparent tubing and a 23 gauge butterfly needle for injection .
Insert the needle and draw the patient ’ s blood to the hub of the syringe so that a small air bubble separates the patient ’ s blood in the tubing from the fluorescein .
With the room lights on , slowly inject the blood back into the vein while watching the skin over the needle tip .
If the needle has extravasated , the patient ’ s blood will be seen to bulge the skin and the injection should be stopped before any fluorescein is injected .
When assured that extravasation has not occurred , the room light may be turned off and the fluorescein injection completed .
Luminescence usually appears in the retina and choroidal vessels in 7 to 14 seconds and can be observed by standard viewing equipment .
Reduction in dose from 5 mL to 2 mL of FLUORESCITE ® Injection 10 % may be appropriate in cases when a highly sensitive imaging system e . g . , scanning laser ophthalmoscope is used .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Single use 5 mL vial containing 100 mg / mL fluorescein .

( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS FLUORESCITE ® Injection 10 % is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to fluorescein sodium or any other ingredients in this product .
Rare cases of death due to anaphylaxis have been reported .
[ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
Fluorescein sodium can induce serious intolerance reactions .
These reactions of intolerance are always unpredictable but they are more frequent in patients who have previously experienced an adverse reaction after fluorescein injection ( symptoms other than nausea and vomiting ) or in patients with history of allergy such as food or drug induced urticaria , asthma , eczema , allergic rhinitis .
Detailed questioning of each patient is recommended before the angiography to evaluate any prior history of allergy .
FLUORESCITE ® Injection 10 % is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to fluorescein sodium or any other ingredients in this product ( 4 . 1 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Respiratory reactions may require intervention .
( 5 . 1 ) Severe local tissue damage can occur with extravasation during injection .
( 5 . 2 ) Nausea and / or vomiting may occur within minutes following injection .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Respiratory Reactions Caution is to be exercised in patients with a history of allergy or bronchial asthma .
An emergency tray should be available in the event of possible reaction to FLUORESCITE ® Injection 10 % .
If a potential allergy is suspected , an intradermal skin test may be performed prior to intravenous administration , i . e . , 0 . 05 mL injected intradermally to be evaluated 30 to 60 minutes following injection .
Given the sensitivity and specificity of skin testing , a negative skin test is not proof that a patient is not allergic to fluorescein .
5 . 2 Severe Local Tissue Damage Care must be taken to avoid extravasation during injection as the high pH of fluorescein solution can result in severe local tissue damage .
The following complications resulting from extravasation of fluorescein have been noted to occur : severe pain in the arm for several hours , sloughing of the skin , superficial phlebitis , subcutaneous granuloma , and toxic neuritis along the median curve in the antecubital area .
When significant extravasation occurs , the injection should be discontinued and conservative measures to treat damaged tissue and to relieve pain should be implemented .
[ see Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] .
5 . 3 Nausea and / or Vomiting Nausea and / or vomiting and gastrointestinal distress occur commonly within the first few minutes following injection .
These reactions usually subside within 10 minutes .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Skin and Urine Discoloration The most common reaction is temporary yellowish discoloration of the skin and urine .
Urine may attain a bright yellow color .
Discoloration of the skin usually fades in 6 to 12 hours and usually fades in urine in 24 to 36 hours .
Gastrointestinal Reactions Nausea , vomiting , and gastrointestinal distress are common adverse events .
A strong taste may develop after injection .
Hypersensitivity Reactions Symptoms and signs of hypersensitivity have occurred .
Generalized hives and itching , bronchospasm and anaphylaxis have been reported .
Rare cases of death have been reported .
[ see Contraindications ( 4 . 1 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Cardiopulmonary Reactions Cardiac arrest , basilar artery ischemia , severe shock and death may occur rarely .
Neurologic Reactions Headache may occur .
Convulsions and syncope may rarely occur following injection .
Thrombophlebitis Thrombophlebitis at the injection site has been reported .
Extravasation of the solution at the injection site causes intense pain at the site and a dull aching pain in the injected arm .
[ see Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
The most common adverse reactions include skin discoloration , urine discoloration , nausea , vomiting , and gastrointestinal distress .

11 DESCRIPTION FLUORESCITE ® ( fluorescein injection , USP ) 10 % contains fluorescein sodium ( equivalent to fluorescein 10 % w / v ) .
It is a sterile solution for use intravenously as a diagnostic aid .
Its chemical name is spiro [ isobenzofuran - 1 ( 3 H ) , 9 ' - [ 9 H ] xanthene ] - 3 - one , 3 ' 6 ' - dihydroxy , disodium salt .
The active ingredient is represented by the chemical structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] FLUORESCITE ® ( fluorescein injection , USP ) 10 % is supplied as a sterile , unpreserved , unit dose aqueous solution , that has a pH of 8 . 0 – 9 . 8 and an osmolality of 572 - 858 mOsm / kg .
Active ingredient : fluorescein sodium Inactive Ingredients : Sodium hydroxide and / or hydrochloric acid ( to adjust pH ) , and water for injection .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Fluorescein sodium responds to electromagnetic radiation and light between the wavelengths of 465 - 490 nm and fluoresces , i . e . , emits light at wavelengths of 520 - 530 nm .
Thus , the hydrocarbon is excited by blue light and emits light that appears yellowish - green .
Following intravenous injection of fluorescein sodium in an aqueous solution , the unbound fraction of the fluorescein can be excited with a blue light flash from a fundus camera as it circulates through the ocular vasculature , and the yellowish green fluorescence of the dye is captured by the camera .
In the fundus , the fluorescence of the dye demarcates the retinal and / or choroidal vasculature under observation , distinguishing it from adjacent areas / structures .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution : Within 7 to 14 seconds after intravenous ( IV ) administration into antecubital vein , fluorescein usually appears in the central artery of the eye .
Within a few minutes of IV administration of fluorescein sodium , a yellowish discoloration of the skin occurs , which begins to fade after 6 to 12 hours of dosing .
Various estimates of volume of distribution indicate that fluorescein distributes well into interstitial space ( 0 . 5 L / kg ) .
Metabolism : Fluorescein undergoes rapid metabolism to fluorescein monoglucuronide .
After IV administration of fluorescein sodium ( 14 mg / kg ) to 7 healthy subjects , approximately 80 % of fluorescein in plasma was converted to glucuronide conjugate after a period of 1 hour post dose , indicating relatively rapid conjugation .
Excretion : Fluorescein and its metabolites are mainly eliminated via renal excretion .
After IV administration , the urine remains slightly fluorescent for 24 to 36 hours .
A renal clearance of 1 . 75 mL / min / kg and a hepatic clearance ( due to conjugation ) of 1 . 50 mL / min / kg have been estimated .
The systemic clearance of fluorescein was essentially complete by 48 to 72 hours after administration of 500 mg fluorescein .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility There have been no long - term studies done using fluorescein in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential .
