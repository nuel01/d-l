2 . 3 Important Administration Instructions Patients receiving abiraterone acetate tablets should also receive a gonadotropin - releasing hormone ( GnRH ) analog concurrently or should have had bilateral orchiectomy .
Abiraterone acetate tablets must be taken on an empty stomach , either one hour before or two hours after a meal [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The tablets should be swallowed whole with water .
Do not crush or chew tablets .
2 . 4 Dose Modification Guidelines in Hepatic Impairment and Hepatotoxicity Hepatic Impairment In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class B ) , reduce the recommended dose of abiraterone acetate tablets to 250 mg once daily .
In patients with moderate hepatic impairment monitor ALT , AST , and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment , every week for the first month , every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter .
If elevations in ALT and / or AST greater than 5 X upper limit of normal ( ULN ) or total bilirubin greater than 3 X ULN occur in patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment , discontinue abiraterone acetate tablets and do not re - treat patients with abiraterone acetate tablets [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Do not use abiraterone acetate tablets in patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) .
Hepatotoxicity For patients who develop hepatotoxicity during treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets ( ALT and / or AST greater than 5 X ULN or total bilirubin greater than 3 X ULN ) , interrupt treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose of 750 mg once daily following return of liver function tests to the patient ’ s baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2 . 5 X ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1 . 5 X ULN .
For patients who resume treatment , monitor serum transaminases and bilirubin at a minimum of every two weeks for three months and monthly thereafter .
If hepatotoxicity recurs at the dose of 750 mg once daily , re - treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose of 500 mg once daily following return of liver function tests to the patient ’ s baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2 . 5 X ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1 . 5 X ULN .
If hepatotoxicity recurs at the reduced dose of 500 mg once daily , discontinue treatment with abiraterone acetate tablets .
Permanently discontinue abiraterone acetate tablets for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 x ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 5 Dose Modification Guidelines for Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers ( e . g . , phenytoin , carbamazepine , rifampin , rifabutin , rifapentine , phenobarbital ) during abiraterone acetate tablets treatment .
If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co - administered , increase the abiraterone acetate tablets dosing frequency to twice a day only during the co - administration period ( e . g . , from 1 , 000 mg once daily to 1 , 000 mg twice a day ) .
Reduce the dose back to the previous dose and frequency , if the concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Abiraterone acetate tablets , USP 250 mg are white to off - white , oval - shaped , uncoated tablets debossed with “ AN65 ” on one side and plain on the other side .
• Uncoated Tablet 250 mg ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Pregnancy Abiraterone acetate can cause fetal harm and potential loss of pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
• Pregnancy .
( 4 , 8 . 1 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Mineralocorticoid excess : Closely monitor patients with cardiovascular disease .
Control hypertension and correct hypokalemia before treatment .
Monitor blood pressure , serum potassium and symptoms of fluid retention at least monthly .
( 5 . 1 ) • Adrenocortical insufficiency : Monitor for symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency .
Increased dosage of corticosteroids may be indicated before , during and after stressful situations .
( 5 . 2 ) • Hepatotoxicity : Can be severe and fatal .
Monitor liver function and modify , interrupt , or discontinue abiraterone acetate dosing as recommended .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Hypertension , Hypokalemia and Fluid Retention Due to Mineralocorticoid Excess Abiraterone acetate may cause hypertension , hypokalemia , and fluid retention as a consequence of increased mineralocorticoid levels resulting from CYP17 inhibition [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor patients for hypertension , hypokalemia , and fluid retention at least once a month .
Control hypertension and correct hypokalemia before and during treatment with abiraterone acetate .
In the combined data from 4 placebo - controlled trials using prednisone 5 mg twice daily in combination with 1 , 000 mg abiraterone acetate daily , grades 3 to 4 hypokalemia were detected in 4 % of patients on the abiraterone acetate arm and 2 % of patients on the placebo arm .
Grades 3 to 4 hypertension were observed in 2 % of patients each arm and grades 3 to 4 fluid retention in 1 % of patients each arm .
Closely monitor patients whose underlying medical conditions might be compromised by increases in blood pressure , hypokalemia or fluid retention , such as those with heart failure , recent myocardial infarction , cardiovascular disease , or ventricular arrhythmia .
The safety of abiraterone acetate in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < 50 % or New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III or IV heart failure ( in COU - AA - 301 ) or NYHA Class II to IV heart failure ( in COU - AA - 302 ) has not been established because these patients were excluded from these randomized clinical trials [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
5 . 2 Adrenocortical Insufficiency Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0 . 3 % of 2 , 230 patients taking abiraterone acetate and in 0 . 1 % of 1 , 763 patients taking placebo in the combined data of randomized , placebo - controlled clinical studies .
Adrenocortical insufficiency was reported in patients receiving abiraterone acetate in combination with prednisone , following interruption of daily steroids and / or with concurrent infection or stress .
Monitor patients for symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency , particularly if patients are withdrawn from prednisone , have prednisone dose reductions , or experience unusual stress .
Symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency may be masked by adverse reactions associated with mineralocorticoid excess seen in patients treated with abiraterone acetate .
If clinically indicated , perform appropriate tests to confirm the diagnosis of adrenocortical insufficiency .
Increased dosage of corticosteroids may be indicated before , during and after stressful situations [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 3 Hepatotoxicity In postmarketing experience , there have been abiraterone acetate - associated severe hepatic toxicity , including fulminant hepatitis , acute liver failure and deaths [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
In the combined data of randomized clinical trials , grade 3 to 4 ALT or AST increases ( at least 5 X ULN ) were reported in 6 % of 2 , 230 patients who received abiraterone acetate , typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment .
Patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver test elevation than those beginning with normal values .
Treatment discontinuation due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic function occurred in 1 . 1 % of 2 , 230 patients taking abiraterone acetate .
In these clinical trials , no deaths clearly related to abiraterone acetate were reported due to hepatotoxicity events .
Measure serum transaminases ( ALT and AST ) and bilirubin levels prior to starting treatment with abiraterone acetate , every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter .
In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment receiving a reduced abiraterone acetate dose of 250 mg , measure ALT , AST , and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment , every week for the first month , every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter .
Promptly measure serum total bilirubin , AST , and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop .
Elevations of AST , ALT , or bilirubin from the patient ’ s baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring .
If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN , or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN , interrupt abiraterone acetate treatment and closely monitor liver function .
Re - treatment with abiraterone acetate at a reduced dose level may take place only after return of liver function tests to the patient ’ s baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2 . 5 X ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1 . 5 X ULN [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
Permanently discontinue abiraterone acetate for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 x ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
The safety of abiraterone acetate re - treatment of patients who develop AST or ALT greater than or equal to 20 X ULN and / or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10 X ULN is unknown .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • CYP3A4 Inducers : Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers during abiraterone acetate tablets treatment .
If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co - administered , increase the abiraterone acetate tablets dosing frequency .
( 2 . 5 , 7 . 1 ) • CYP2D6 Substrates : Avoid co - administration of abiraterone acetate tablets with CYP2D6 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic index .
If an alternative treatment cannot be used , exercise caution and consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate .
( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Drugs that Inhibit or Induce CYP3A4 Enzymes Based on in vitro data , abiraterone acetate is a substrate of CYP3A4 .
In a dedicated drug interaction trial , co - administration of rifampin , a strong CYP3A4 inducer , decreased exposure of abiraterone by 55 % .
Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers during abiraterone acetate treatment .
If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co - administered , increase the abiraterone acetate dosing frequency [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In a dedicated drug interaction trial , co - administration of ketoconazole , a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 , had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Effects of Abiraterone on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes Abiraterone acetate is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug - metabolizing enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C8 .
In a CYP2D6 drug - drug interaction trial , the C max and AUC of dextromethorphan ( CYP2D6 substrate ) were increased 2 . 8 - and 2 . 9 - fold , respectively , when dextromethorphan was given with abiraterone acetate 1 , 000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg twice daily .
Avoid co - administration of abiraterone acetate with substrates of CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic index ( e . g . , thioridazine ) .
If alternative treatments cannot be used , consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate drug [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In a CYP2C8 drug - drug interaction trial in healthy subjects , the AUC of pioglitazone ( CYP2C8 substrate ) was increased by 46 % when pioglitazone was given together with a single dose of 1 , 000 mg abiraterone acetate .
Therefore , patients should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity related to a CYP2C8 substrate with a narrow therapeutic index if used concomitantly with abiraterone acetate [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception .
( 8 . 3 ) • Do not use abiraterone acetate tablets in patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) .
( 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action , abiraterone acetate is contraindicated for use in pregnant women because the drug can cause fetal harm and potential loss of pregnancy .
Abiraterone acetate is not indicated for use in females .
There are no human data on the use of abiraterone acetate in pregnant women .
In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of abiraterone acetate to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental effects at maternal exposures approximately ≥ 0 . 03 times the human exposure ( AUC ) at the recommended dose ( see Data ) .
Data Animal Data In an embryo - fetal developmental toxicity study in rats , abiraterone acetate caused developmental toxicity when administered at oral doses of 10 , 30 or 100 mg / kg / day throughout the period of organogenesis ( gestational days 6 to 17 ) .
Findings included embryo - fetal lethality ( increased post implantation loss and resorptions and decreased number of live fetuses ) , fetal developmental delay ( skeletal effects ) and urogenital effects ( bilateral ureter dilation ) at doses ≥ 10 mg / kg / day , decreased fetal ano - genital distance at ≥ 30 mg / kg / day , and decreased fetal body weight at 100 mg / kg / day .
Doses ≥ 10 mg / kg / day caused maternal toxicity .
The doses tested in rats resulted in systemic exposures ( AUC ) approximately 0 . 03 , 0 . 1 and 0 . 3 times , respectively , the AUC in patients .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Abiraterone acetate is not indicated for use in women .
There is no information available on the presence of abiraterone acetate in human milk , or on the effects on the breastfed child or milk production .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Males Based on findings in animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action , advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 weeks after the final dose of abiraterone acetate [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Based on animal studies , abiraterone acetate may impair reproductive function and fertility in males of reproductive potential [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of abiraterone acetate in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients receiving abiraterone acetate in randomized clinical trials , 70 % of patients were 65 years and over and 27 % were 75 years and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these elderly patients and younger patients .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
8 . 6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in subjects with baseline mild ( N = 8 ) or moderate ( N = 8 ) hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A and B , respectively ) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function .
The systemic exposure ( AUC ) of abiraterone after a single oral 1 , 000 mg dose of abiraterone acetate increased by approximately 1 . 1 - fold and 3 . 6 - fold in subjects with mild and moderate baseline hepatic impairment , respectively compared to subjects with normal hepatic function .
In another trial , the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in subjects with baseline severe ( N = 8 ) hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function .
The systemic exposure ( AUC ) of abiraterone increased by approximately 7 - fold and the fraction of free drug increased 2 - fold in subjects with severe baseline hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function .
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with baseline mild hepatic impairment .
In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class B ) , reduce the recommended dose of abiraterone acetate to 250 mg once daily .
Do not use abiraterone acetate in patients with baseline severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) .
If elevations in ALT or AST > 5 X ULN or total bilirubin > 3 X ULN occur in patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment , discontinue abiraterone acetate treatment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Abiraterone acetate is converted in vivo to abiraterone , an androgen biosynthesis inhibitor , that inhibits 17 α - hydroxylase / C17 , 20 - lyase ( CYP17 ) .
This enzyme is expressed in testicular , adrenal , and prostatic tumor tissues and is required for androgen biosynthesis .
CYP17 catalyzes two sequential reactions : 1 ) the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17α - hydroxy derivatives by 17α - hydroxylase activity and 2 ) the subsequent formation of dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) and androstenedione , respectively , by C17 , 20 lyase activity .
DHEA and androstenedione are androgens and are precursors of testosterone .
Inhibition of CYP17 by abiraterone can also result in increased mineralocorticoid production by the adrenals [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Androgen sensitive prostatic carcinoma responds to treatment that decreases androgen levels .
Androgen deprivation therapies , such as treatment with GnRH agonists or orchiectomy , decrease androgen production in the testes but do not affect androgen production by the adrenals or in the tumor .
Abiraterone acetate decreased serum testosterone and other androgens in patients in the placebo - controlled clinical trial .
It is not necessary to monitor the effect of abiraterone acetate on serum testosterone levels .
Changes in serum prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) levels may be observed but have not been shown to correlate with clinical benefit in individual patients .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Following administration of abiraterone acetate , the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone and abiraterone acetate have been studied in healthy subjects and in patients with metastatic CRPC .
In vivo , abiraterone acetate is converted to abiraterone .
In clinical studies , abiraterone acetate plasma concentrations were below detectable levels ( < 0 . 2 ng / mL ) in > 99 % of the analyzed samples .
Absorption Following oral administration of abiraterone acetate to patients with metastatic CRPC , the median time to reach maximum plasma abiraterone concentrations is 2 hours .
Abiraterone accumulation is observed at steady - state , with a 2 - fold higher exposure ( steady - state AUC ) compared to a single 1 , 000 mg dose of abiraterone acetate .
At the dose of 1 , 000 mg daily in patients with metastatic CRPC , steady - state values ( mean ± SD ) of C max were 226 ± 178 ng / mL and of AUC were 993 ± 639 ng . hr / mL .
No major deviation from dose proportionality was observed in the dose range of 250 mg to 1 , 000 mg .
However , the exposure was not significantly increased when the dose was doubled from 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 mg ( 8 % increase in the mean AUC ) .
Systemic exposure of abiraterone is increased when abiraterone acetate is administered with food .
In healthy subjects abiraterone C max and AUC 0 - ∞ were approximately 7 - and 5 - fold higher , respectively , when a single dose of abiraterone acetate was administered with a low - fat meal ( 7 % fat , 300 calories ) and approximately 17 - and 10 - fold higher , respectively , when a single dose of abiraterone acetate was administered with a high - fat ( 57 % fat , 825 calories ) meal compared to overnight fasting .
Abiraterone AUC 0 - ∞ was approximately 7 - fold or 1 . 6 - fold higher , respectively , when a single dose of abiraterone acetate was administered 2 hours after or 1 hour before a medium fat meal ( 25 % fat , 491 calories ) compared to overnight fasting .
Systemic exposures of abiraterone in patients with metastatic CRPC , after repeated dosing of abiraterone acetate were similar when abiraterone acetate was taken with low - fat meals for 7 days and increased approximately 2 - fold when taken with high - fat meals for 7 days compared to when taken at least 2 hours after a meal and at least 1 hour before a meal for 7 days .
Given the normal variation in the content and composition of meals , taking abiraterone acetate with meals has the potential to result in increased and highly variable exposures .
Therefore , abiraterone acetate must be taken on an empty stomach , either one hour before or two hours after a meal .
The tablets should be swallowed whole with water [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Distribution and Protein Binding Abiraterone is highly bound ( > 99 % ) to the human plasma proteins , albumin and alpha - 1 acid glycoprotein .
The apparent steady - state volume of distribution ( mean ± SD ) is 19 , 669 ± 13 , 358 L .
In vitro studies show that at clinically relevant concentrations , abiraterone acetate and abiraterone are not substrates of P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) and that abiraterone acetate is an inhibitor of P - gp .
Metabolism Following oral administration of 14 C - abiraterone acetate as capsules , abiraterone acetate is hydrolyzed to abiraterone ( active metabolite ) .
The conversion is likely through esterase activity ( the esterases have not been identified ) and is not CYP mediated .
The two main circulating metabolites of abiraterone in human plasma are abiraterone sulphate ( inactive ) and N - oxide abiraterone sulphate ( inactive ) , which account for about 43 % of exposure each .
CYP3A4 and SULT2A1 are the enzymes involved in the formation of N - oxide abiraterone sulphate and SULT2A1 is involved in the formation of abiraterone sulphate .
Excretion In patients with metastatic CRPC , the mean terminal half - life of abiraterone in plasma ( mean ± SD ) is 12 ± 5 hours .
Following oral administration of 14 C - abiraterone acetate , approximately 88 % of the radioactive dose is recovered in feces and approximately 5 % in urine .
The major compounds present in feces are unchanged abiraterone acetate and abiraterone ( approximately 55 % and 22 % of the administered dose , respectively ) .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of abiraterone was examined in subjects with baseline mild ( N = 8 ) or moderate ( N = 8 ) hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A and B , respectively ) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function .
Systemic exposure to abiraterone after a single oral 1 , 000 mg dose given under fasting conditions increased approximately 1 . 1 - fold and 3 . 6 - fold in subjects with mild and moderate baseline hepatic impairment , respectively .
The mean half - life of abiraterone is prolonged to approximately 18 hours in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and to approximately 19 hours in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment .
In another trial , the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in subjects with baseline severe ( N = 8 ) hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) and in 8 healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function .
The systemic exposure ( AUC ) of abiraterone increased by approximately 7 - fold in subjects with severe baseline hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal hepatic function .
In addition , the mean protein binding was found to be lower in the severe hepatic impairment group compared to the normal hepatic function group , which resulted in a two - fold increase in the fraction of free drug in patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Patients with Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of abiraterone were examined in patients with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) on a stable hemodialysis schedule ( N = 8 ) and in matched control subjects with normal renal function ( N = 8 ) .
In the ESRD cohort of the trial , a single 1 , 000 mg abiraterone acetate dose was given under fasting conditions 1 hour after dialysis , and samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected up to 96 hours post dose .
Systemic exposure to abiraterone after a single oral 1 , 000 mg dose did not increase in subjects with end - stage renal disease on dialysis , compared to subjects with normal renal function [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Drug Interactions In vitro studies with human hepatic microsomes showed that abiraterone has the potential to inhibit CYP1A2 , CYP2D6 , CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 / 5 .
In an in vivo drug - drug interaction trial , the C max and AUC of dextromethorphan ( CYP2D6 substrate ) were increased 2 . 8 - and 2 . 9 - fold , respectively when dextromethorphan 30 mg was given with abiraterone acetate 1 , 000 mg daily ( plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily ) .
The AUC for dextrorphan , the active metabolite of dextromethorphan , increased approximately 1 . 3 fold [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
In a clinical study to determine the effects of abiraterone acetate 1 , 000 mg daily ( plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily ) on a single 100 mg dose of the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline , no increase in systemic exposure of theophylline was observed .
Abiraterone is a substrate of CYP3A4 , in vitro .
In a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study of healthy subjects pretreated with a strong CYP3A4 inducer ( rifampin , 600 mg daily for 6 days ) followed by a single dose of abiraterone acetate 1 , 000 mg , the mean plasma AUC ∞ of abiraterone was decreased by 55 % [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
In a separate clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study of healthy subjects , co - administration of ketoconazole , a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 , had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
In a CYP2C8 drug - drug interaction trial in healthy subjects , the AUC of pioglitazone was increased by 46 % when pioglitazone was given together with a single dose of 1 , 000 mg abiraterone acetate [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
In vitro , abiraterone and its major metabolites were shown to inhibit the hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1 .
There are no clinical data available to confirm transporter based interaction .
12 . 6 QT Prolongation In a multi - center , open - label , single - arm trial , 33 patients with metastatic CRPC received abiraterone acetate orally at a dose of 1 , 000 mg once daily at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal in combination with prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily .
Assessments up to Cycle 2 Day 2 showed no large changes in the QTc interval ( i . e . , > 20 ms ) from baseline .
However , small increases in the QTc interval ( i . e . , < 10 ms ) due to abiraterone acetate cannot be excluded due to study design limitations .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , and Impairment of Fertility A two - year carcinogenicity study was conducted in rats at oral abiraterone acetate doses of 5 , 15 , and 50 mg / kg / day for males and 15 , 50 , and 150 mg / kg / day for females .
Abiraterone acetate increased the combined incidence of interstitial cell adenomas and carcinomas in the testes at all dose levels tested .
This finding is considered to be related to the pharmacological activity of abiraterone .
Rats are regarded as more sensitive than humans to developing interstitial cell tumors in the testes .
Abiraterone acetate was not carcinogenic in female rats at exposure levels up to 0 . 8 times the human clinical exposure based on AUC .
Abiraterone acetate was not carcinogenic in a 6 - month study in the transgenic ( Tg . rasH2 ) mouse .
Abiraterone acetate and abiraterone was not mutagenic in an in vitro microbial mutagenesis ( Ames ) assay or clastogenic in an in vitro cytogenetic assay using primary human lymphocytes or an in vivo rat micronucleus assay .
In repeat - dose toxicity studies in male rats ( 13 - and 26 - weeks ) and monkeys ( 39 - weeks ) , atrophy , aspermia / hypospermia , and hyperplasia in the reproductive system were observed at ≥ 50 mg / kg / day in rats and ≥ 250 mg / kg / day in monkeys and were consistent with the antiandrogenic pharmacological activity of abiraterone .
These effects were observed in rats at systemic exposures similar to humans and in monkeys at exposures approximately 0 . 6 times the AUC in humans .
In a fertility study in male rats , reduced organ weights of the reproductive system , sperm counts , sperm motility , altered sperm morphology and decreased fertility were observed in animals dosed for 4 weeks at ≥ 30 mg / kg / day orally .
Mating of untreated females with males that received 30 mg / kg / day oral abiraterone acetate resulted in a reduced number of corpora lutea , implantations and live embryos and an increased incidence of pre - implantation loss .
Effects on male rats were reversible after 16 weeks from the last abiraterone acetate administration .
In a fertility study in female rats , animals dosed orally for 2 weeks until day 7 of pregnancy at ≥ 30 mg / kg / day had an increased incidence of irregular or extended estrous cycles and pre - implantation loss ( 300 mg / kg / day ) .
There were no differences in mating , fertility , and litter parameters in female rats that received abiraterone acetate .
Effects on female rats were reversible after 4 weeks from the last abiraterone acetate administration .
The dose of 30 mg / kg / day in rats is approximately 0 . 3 times the recommended dose of 1 , 000 mg / day based on body surface area .
In 13 - and 26 - week studies in rats and 13 - and 39 - week studies in monkeys , a reduction in circulating testosterone levels occurred with abiraterone acetate at approximately one half the human clinical exposure based on AUC .
As a result , decreases in organ weights and toxicities were observed in the male and female reproductive system , adrenal glands , liver , pituitary ( rats only ) , and male mammary glands .
The changes in the reproductive organs are consistent with the antiandrogenic pharmacological activity of abiraterone acetate .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology A dose - dependent increase in cataracts was observed in rats after daily oral abiraterone acetate administration for 26 weeks starting at ≥ 50 mg / kg / day ( similar to the human clinical exposure based on AUC ) .
In a 39 - week monkey study with daily oral abiraterone acetate administration , no cataracts were observed at higher doses ( 2 times greater than the clinical exposure based on AUC ) .

The following patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms .
The median age was 69 years ( range 39 to 95 ) and the racial distribution was 93 % Caucasian , 3 . 6 % Black , 1 . 7 % Asian , and 1 . 6 % Other .
Eighty - nine percent of patients enrolled had an ECOG performance status score of 0 to 1 and 45 % had a Brief Pain Inventory - Short Form score of ≥ 4 ( patient ’ s reported worst pain over the previous 24 hours ) .
Ninety percent of patients had metastases in bone and 30 % had visceral involvement .
Seventy percent of patients had radiographic evidence of disease progression and 30 % had PSA - only progression .
Seventy percent of patients had previously received one cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen and 30 % received two regimens .
The protocol pre - specified interim analysis was conducted after 552 deaths and showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival ( OS ) in patients treated with abiraterone acetate with prednisone compared to patients in the placebo with prednisone arm ( Table 9 and Figure 1 ) .
An updated survival analysis was conducted when 775 deaths ( 97 % of the planned number of deaths for final analysis ) were observed .
