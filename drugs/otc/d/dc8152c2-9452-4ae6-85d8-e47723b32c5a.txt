4 CONTRAINDICATIONS DEXTENZA is contraindicated in patients with active corneal , conjunctival or canalicular infections , including epithelial herpes simplex keratitis ( dendritic keratitis ) , vaccinia , varicella ; mycobacterial infections ; fungal diseases of the eye , and dacryocystitis .
Active ocular infections ( 4 ) .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Intraocular Pressure Increase : Monitor intraocular pressure ( 5 . 1 ) .
• Bacterial Infections : Steroids may mask signs of infections and enhance existing infections ( 5 . 2 ) .
• Viral Infections : Ocular steroids may prolong the course and exacerbate the severity of ocular viral infections ( 5 . 3 ) .
• Fungal Infections : Consider fungal invasion in any persistent corneal ulceration ( 5 . 4 ) .
• Delayed Healing : Ocular steroids may slow the rate of ocular healing .
( 5 . 5 ) .
5 . 1 Intraocular Pressure Increase Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve , defects in visual acuity and fields of vision .
Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma .
Intraocular pressure should be monitored during the course of the treatment .
5 . 2 Bacterial Infection Corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard for secondary ocular infections .
In acute purulent conditions , steroids may mask infection and enhance existing infection [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
5 . 3 Viral Infections Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye ( including herpes simplex ) [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
5 . 4 Fungal Infections Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use .
Fungal culture should be taken when appropriate [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
5 . 5 Delayed Healing The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation .
5 . 6 Other Potential Corticosteroid Complications The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order of DEXTENZA should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification , such as slit lamp biomicroscopy , and , where appropriate , fluorescein staining .
If signs and symptoms fail to improve after 2 days , the patient should be re - evaluated .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • Intraocular Pressure Increase [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Bacterial Infection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Viral Infection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Fungal Infection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Delayed Healing [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • The most commonly reported adverse reactions were anterior chamber inflammation and elevations in intraocular pressure .
These occurred in approximately 6 - 10 % of patients ( 6 ) .
To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Ocular Therapeutix at 1 - 800 - DEXTENZA ( 339 - 8369 ) or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Adverse reactions associated with ophthalmic steroids include elevated intraocular pressure , which may be associated with optic nerve damage , visual acuity and field defects , posterior subcapsular cataract formation ; delayed wound healing ; secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex , and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of the cornea or sclera [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ] .
6 . 2 Ocular Inflammation and Pain Following Ophthalmic Surgery DEXTENZA safety was studied in four randomized , vehicle - controlled studies ( n = 567 ) .
The mean age of the population was 68 years ( range 35 to 87 years ) , 59 % were female , and 83 % were white .
Forty - seven percent had brown iris color and 30 % had blue iris color .
The most common ocular adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with DEXTENZA were : anterior chamber inflammation including iritis and iridocyclitis ( 10 % ) ; intraocular pressure increased ( 6 % ) ; visual acuity reduced ( 2 % ) ; cystoid macular edema ( 1 % ) ; corneal edema ( 1 % ) ; eye pain ( 1 % ) and conjunctival hyperemia ( 1 % ) .
The most common non - ocular adverse reaction that occurred in patients treated with DEXTENZA was headache ( 1 % ) .
6 . 3 Itching Associated with Allergic Conjunctivitis DEXTENZA safety was studied in four randomized , vehicle - controlled studies ( n = 154 ) .
The mean age of the population was 41 years ( range 19 to 69 years ) , 55 % were female and 61 % were white .
Fifty seven percent had brown iris color and 20 % had blue iris color .
The most common ocular adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with DEXTENZA were : intraocular pressure increased ( 3 % ) , lacrimation increased ( 1 % ) , eye discharge ( 1 % ) , and visual acuity reduced ( 1 % ) .
The most common non - ocular adverse reaction that occurred in patients treated with DEXTENZA was headache ( 1 % ) .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate or well - controlled studies with DEXTENZA in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of topical ocular dexamethasone to pregnant mice and rabbits during organogenesis produced embryofetal lethality , cleft palate and multiple visceral malformations [ see Animal Data ] .
Data Animal Data Topical ocular administration of 0 . 15 % dexamethasone ( 0 . 75 mg / kg / day ) on gestational days 10 to 13 produced embryofetal lethality and a high incidence of cleft palate in a mouse study .
A daily dose of 0 . 75 mg / kg / day in the mouse is approximately 5 times the entire dose of dexamethasone in the DEXTENZA product , on a mg / m2 basis .
In a rabbit study , topical ocular administration of 0 . 1 % dexamethasone throughout organogenesis ( 0 . 36 mg / day , on gestational day 6 followed by 0 . 24 mg / day on gestational days 7 - 18 ) produced intestinal anomalies , intestinal aplasia , gastroschisis and hypoplastic kidneys .
A daily dose of 0 . 24 mg / day is approximately 6 times the entire dose of dexamethasone in the DEXTENZA product , on a mg / m2 basis .
8 . 2 Lactation Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth and interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production ; however the systemic concentration of dexamethasone following administration of DEXTENZA is low [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
There is no information regarding the presence of DEXTENZA in human milk , the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production to inform risk of DEXTENZA to an infant during lactation .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for DEXTENZA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from DEXTENZA .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients .
