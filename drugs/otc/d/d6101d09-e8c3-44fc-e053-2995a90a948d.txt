• when coadministered with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A or UGT1A1 for clearance , and for which elevated plasma concentrations of the interacting drugs are associated with serious and / or life - threatening events ( see Table 6 ) .
• when coadministered with drugs that strongly induce CYP3A and may lead to lower exposure and loss of efficacy of REYATAZ ( see Table 6 ) .
Table 6 displays drugs that are contraindicated with REYATAZ .
Table 6 : Drugs that are Contraindicated with REYATAZ ( Information in the table applies to REYATAZ with or without ritonavir , unless otherwise indicated ) a See DRUG INTERACTIONS , TABLE 16 ( 7 ) for parenterally administered midazolam .
b See DRUG INTERACTIONS , TABLE 16 ( 7 ) for sildenafil when dosed as VIAGRA ® for erectile dysfunction .
Drug Class Drugs within class that are contraindicated with REYATAZ Clinical Comment Alpha 1 - Adrenoreceptor Antagonist Alfuzosin Potential for increased alfuzosin concentrations , which can result in hypotension .
Antimycobacterials Rifampin Rifampin substantially decreases plasma concentrations of atazanavir , which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance .
Antineoplastics Irinotecan Atazanavir inhibits UGT1A1 and may interfere with the metabolism of irinotecan , resulting in increased irinotecan toxicities .
Antipsychotics Lurasidone Potential for serious and / or life - threatening reactions if REYATAZ is coadministered with ritonavir .
Pimozide Potential for serious and / or life - threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias .
Benzodiazepines Triazolam , orally administered midazolama Triazolam and orally administered midazolam are extensively metabolized by CYP3A4 .
Coadministration of triazolam or orally administered midazolam with REYATAZ may cause large increases in the concentration of these benzodiazepines .
Potential for serious and / or life - threatening events such as prolonged or increased sedation or respiratory depression .
Ergot Derivatives Dihydroergotamine , ergotamine , ergonovine , methylergonovine Potential for serious and / or life - threatening events such as acute ergot toxicity characterized by peripheral vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities and other tissues .
GI Motility Agent Cisapride Potential for serious and / or life - threatening reactions such as cardiac arrhythmias .
Herbal Products St . John ’ s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) Coadministration of St . John ’ s wort and REYATAZ may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance .
HMG - CoA Reductase Inhibitors Lovastatin , simvastatin Potential for serious reactions such as myopathy , including rhabdomyolysis .
PDE5 Inhibitor Sildenafilb when dosed as REVATIO ® for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension Potential for sildenafil - associated adverse events ( which include visual disturbances , hypotension , priapism , and syncope ) .
Protease Inhibitors Indinavir Both REYATAZ and indinavir are associated with indirect ( unconjugated ) hyperbilirubinemia .
Non - nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors Nevirapine Nevirapine substantially decreases atazanavir exposure which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance .
Potential risk for nevirapine - associated adverse reactions due to increased nevirapine exposures .
Table 6 : Drugs that are Contraindicated with REYATAZ ( Information in the table applies to REYATAZ with or without ritonavir , unless otherwise indicated ) a See DRUG INTERACTIONS , TABLE 16 ( 7 ) for parenterally administered midazolam .
b See DRUG INTERACTIONS , TABLE 16 ( 7 ) for sildenafil when dosed as VIAGRA ® for erectile dysfunction .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5 . 1 Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities REYATAZ has been shown to prolong the PR interval of the electrocardiogram in some patients .
In healthy volunteers and in patients , abnormalities in atrioventricular ( AV ) conduction were asymptomatic and generally limited to first - degree AV block .
There have been reports of second - degree AV block and other conduction abnormalities [ see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 . 2 ) and OVERDOSAGE ( 10 ) ] .
In clinical trials that included electrocardiograms , asymptomatic first - degree AV block was observed in 5 . 9 % of atazanavir - treated patients ( n = 920 ) , 5 . 2 % of lopinavir / ritonavir - treated patients ( n = 252 ) , 10 . 4 % of nelfinavir - treated patients ( n = 48 ) , and 3 . 0 % of efavirenz - treated patients ( n = 329 ) .
In Study AI424 - 045 , asymptomatic first - degree AV block was observed in 5 % ( 6 / 118 ) of atazanavir / ritonavir - treated patients and 5 % ( 6 / 116 ) of lopinavir / ritonavir - treated patients who had on - study electrocardiogram measurements .
Because of limited clinical experience in patients with preexisting conduction system disease ( eg , marked first - degree AV block or second - or third - degree AV block ) .
ECG monitoring should be considered in these patients .
[ See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 2 ) . ]
5 . 2 Severe Skin Reactions In controlled clinical trials , rash ( all grades , regardless of causality ) occurred in approximately 20 % of patients treated with REYATAZ .
The median time to onset of rash in clinical studies was 7 . 3 weeks and the median duration of rash was 1 . 4 weeks .
Rashes were generally mild - to - moderate maculopapular skin eruptions .
Treatment - emergent adverse reactions of moderate or severe rash ( occurring at a rate of ≥ 2 % ) are presented for the individual clinical studies [ see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Dosing with REYATAZ was often continued without interruption in patients who developed rash .
The discontinuation rate for rash in clinical trials was < 1 % .
Cases of Stevens - Johnson syndrome , erythema multiforme , and toxic skin eruptions , including drug rash , eosinophilia , and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) syndrome , have been reported in patients receiving REYATAZ .
[ See CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) and ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 . 1 ) . ]
REYATAZ should be discontinued if severe rash develops .
5 . 3 Hyperbilirubinemia Most patients taking REYATAZ experience asymptomatic elevations in indirect ( unconjugated ) bilirubin related to inhibition of UDP - glucuronosyl transferase ( UGT ) .
This hyperbilirubinemia is reversible upon discontinuation of REYATAZ .
Hepatic transaminase elevations that occur with hyperbilirubinemia should be evaluated for alternative etiologies .
No long - term safety data are available for patients experiencing persistent elevations in total bilirubin > 5 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) .
Alternative antiretroviral therapy to REYATAZ may be considered if jaundice or scleral icterus associated with bilirubin elevations presents cosmetic concerns for patients .
Dose reduction of atazanavir is not recommended since long - term efficacy of reduced doses has not been established .
[ See ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 . 1 ) . ]
5 . 4 Patients with Phenylketonuria Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria ( PKU ) .
REYATAZ oral powder contains phenylalanine ( a component of aspartame ) .
Each packet of REYATAZ oral powder contains 35 mg of phenylalanine .
REYATAZ capsules do not contain phenylalanine .
5 . 5 Hepatotoxicity Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C viral infections or marked elevations in transaminases before treatment may be at increased risk for developing further transaminase elevations or hepatic decompensation .
In these patients , hepatic laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with REYATAZ and during treatment .
[ See ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 . 1 ) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8 . 8 ) . ]
5 . 6 Nephrolithiasis and Cholelithiasis Cases of nephrolithiasis and / or cholelithiasis have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV - infected patients receiving REYATAZ therapy .
Some patients required hospitalization for additional management and some had complications .
Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice , estimates of frequency cannot be made .
If signs or symptoms of nephrolithiasis and / or cholelithiasis occur , temporary interruption or discontinuation of therapy may be considered .
[ See ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 . 2 ) . ]
5 . 7 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions Initiation of REYATAZ with ritonavir , a CYP3A inhibitor , in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving REYATAZ with ritonavir , may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A .
Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of REYATAZ with ritonavir , respectively .
These interactions may lead to : • clinically significant adverse reactions potentially leading to severe , life threatening , or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications .
• clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of REYATAZ with ritonavir .
• loss of therapeutic effect of REYATAZ with ritonavir and possible development of resistance .
See Table 16 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions , including dosing recommendations [ see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7 ) ] .
Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during REYATAZ / ritonavir therapy ; review concomitant medications during REYATAZ / ritonavir therapy ; and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) and DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7 ) ] .
5 . 8 Diabetes Mellitus / Hyperglycemia New - onset diabetes mellitus , exacerbation of preexisting diabetes mellitus , and hyperglycemia have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in HIV - infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy .
Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events .
In some cases , diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred .
In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy , hyperglycemia persisted in some cases .
Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice , estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established .
[ See ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 . 2 ) . ]
5 . 9 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy , including REYATAZ .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia , or tuberculosis ) , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
Autoimmune disorders ( such as Graves ’ disease , polymyositis , and Guillain - Barré syndrome ) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution ; however , the time to onset is more variable , and can occur many months after initiation of treatment .
5 . 10 Fat Redistribution Redistribution / accumulation of body fat including central obesity , dorsocervical fat enlargement ( buffalo hump ) , peripheral wasting , facial wasting , breast enlargement , and “ cushingoid appearance ” have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy .
The mechanism and long - term consequences of these events are currently unknown .
A causal relationship has not been established .
5 . 11 Hemophilia There have been reports of increased bleeding , including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis , in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors .
In some patients additional factor VIII was given .
In more than half of the reported cases , treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced .
A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established .
5 . 12 Resistance / Cross - Resistance Various degrees of cross - resistance among protease inhibitors have been observed .
Resistance to atazanavir may not preclude the subsequent use of other protease inhibitors .
[ See MICROBIOLOGY ( 12 . 4 ) . ]
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling : • cardiac conduction abnormalities [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] • rash [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 2 ) ] • hyperbilirubinemia [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 3 ) ] • nephrolithiasis and cholelithiasis [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 6 ) ] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
6 . 1 Clinical Trial Experience Adverse Reactions in Treatment - Naive Adult Patients The safety profile of REYATAZ in treatment - naive adults is based on 1625 HIV - 1 infected patients in clinical trials .

All other Grade 3 – 4 laboratory abnormalities occurred with a frequency of less than 3 % .
Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients : REYATAZ Oral Powder The data described below reflect exposure to REYATAZ oral powder in 155 subjects weighing at least 5 kg to less than 35 kg , including 134 patients exposed for 48 weeks .
These data are from two pooled open - label , multi - center clinical trials in treatment - naive and treatment - experienced pediatric patients ( AI424 - 397 [ PRINCE I ] and AI424 - 451 [ PRINCE II ] ) .
Age ranged from 3 months to 10 years of age .
In these studies 51 % were female and 49 % were male .
All patients received ritonavir and 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) .
The safety profile of REYATAZ in pediatric patients taking REYATAZ oral powder was generally similar to that observed in clinical studies of REYATAZ in pediatric patients taking REYATAZ capsules .
The most common Grade 3 – 4 laboratory abnormalities occurring in pediatric patients weighing 5 kg to less than 35 kg taking REYATAZ oral powder were increased amylase ( 33 % ) , neutropenia ( 9 % ) , increased SGPT / ALT ( 9 % ) , elevation of total bilirubin ( ≥ 2 . 6 times ULN , 16 % ) , and increased lipase ( 8 % ) .
All other Grade 3 – 4 laboratory abnormalities occurred with a frequency of less than 3 % .
Adverse Reactions in Patients Co - Infected with Hepatitis B and / or Hepatitis C Virus In study AI424 - 138 , 60 patients treated with REYATAZ / ritonavir 300 mg / 100 mg once daily , and 51 patients treated with lopinavir / ritonavir 400 mg / 100 mg twice daily , each with fixed dose tenofovir - emtricitabine , were seropositive for hepatitis B and / or C at study entry .

AST levels > 5 times ULN developed in 9 % of the REYATAZ - treated patients , 5 % of the efavirenz - treated patients , and 17 % of the nelfinavir - treated patients .
Within REYATAZ and control regimens , no difference in frequency of bilirubin elevations was noted between seropositive and seronegative patients .
[ See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 3 ) . ]
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following events have been identified during postmarketing use of REYATAZ .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Body as a Whole : edema Cardiovascular System : second - degree AV block , third - degree AV block , left bundle branch block , QTc prolongation [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] Gastrointestinal System : pancreatitis Hepatic System : hepatic function abnormalities Hepatobiliary Disorders : cholelithiasis [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 5 ) ] , cholecystitis , cholestasis Metabolic System and Nutrition Disorders : diabetes mellitus , hyperglycemia [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 8 ) ] Musculoskeletal System : arthralgia Renal System : nephrolithiasis [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 6 ) ] , interstitial nephritis Skin and Appendages : alopecia , maculopapular rash [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 2 ) ] , pruritus , angioedema 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Potential for REYATAZ to Affect Other Drugs Atazanavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A and UGT1A1 .
Coadministration of REYATAZ and drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A or UGT1A1 may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other drug that could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effects .
Atazanavir is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8 .
Use of REYATAZ without ritonavir is not recommended when coadministered with drugs highly dependent on CYP2C8 with narrow therapeutic indices ( eg , paclitaxel , repaglinide ) .
When REYATAZ with ritonavir is coadministered with substrates of CYP2C8 , clinically significant interactions are not expected [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , TABLE 22 ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The magnitude of CYP3A - mediated drug interactions on coadministered drug may change when REYATAZ is coadministered with ritonavir .
See the complete prescribing information for ritonavir for information on drug interactions with ritonavir .
7 . 2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect REYATAZ Atazanavir is a CYP3A4 substrate ; therefore , drugs that induce CYP3A4 may decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations and reduce REYATAZ ’ s therapeutic effect .
Atazanavir solubility decreases as pH increases .
Reduced plasma concentrations of atazanavir are expected if proton - pump inhibitors , antacids , buffered medications , or H2 - receptor antagonists are administered with REYATAZ [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 , 2 . 4 , and 2 . 5 ) ] .
7 . 3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Table 16 provides dosing recommendations in adults as a result of drug interactions with REYATAZ .
These recommendations are based on either drug interaction studies or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious events or loss of efficacy .
Table 16 : Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions : Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Studiesa or Predicted Interactions ( Information in the table applies to REYATAZ with or without ritonavir , unless otherwise indicated ) Concomitant Drug Class : Specific Drugs Effect on Concentration of Atazanavir or Concomitant Drug Clinical Comment a For magnitude of interactions see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , TABLES 21 AND 22 ( 12 . 3 ) .
b See CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) , TABLE 6 for orally administered midazolam .
c In combination with atazanavir 300 mg and ritonavir 100 mg once daily .
d In combination with atazanavir 400 mg once daily .
HIV Antiviral Agents Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors ( NRTIs ) : didanosine buffered formulations enteric - coated ( EC ) capsules ↓ atazanavir ↓ didanosine Coadministration of REYATAZ with didanosine buffered tablets resulted in a marked decrease in atazanavir exposure .
It is recommended that REYATAZ be given ( with food ) 2 h before or 1 h after didanosine buffered formulations .
Simultaneous administration of didanosine EC and REYATAZ with food results in a decrease in didanosine exposure .
Thus , REYATAZ and didanosine EC should be administered at different times .
Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors : tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ↓ atazanavir ↑ tenofovir Tenofovir may decrease the AUC and Cmin of atazanavir .
When coadministered with tenofovir in adults , it is recommended that REYATAZ 300 mg be given with ritonavir 100 mg and tenofovir 300 mg ( all as a single daily dose with food ) .
REYATAZ increases tenofovir concentrations .
The mechanism of this interaction is unknown .
Higher tenofovir concentrations could potentiate tenofovir - associated adverse reactions , including renal disorders .
Patients receiving REYATAZ and tenofovir should be monitored for tenofovir - associated adverse reactions .
For pregnant women taking REYATAZ with ritonavir and tenofovir , see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 5 ) .
Non - nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors ( NNRTIs ) : efavirenz ↓ atazanavir Efavirenz decreases atazanavir exposure .
In treatment - naive adult patients : If REYATAZ is combined with efavirenz , REYATAZ 400 mg ( two 200 - mg capsules ) should be administered with ritonavir 100 mg simultaneously once daily with food , and efavirenz 600 mg should be administered once daily on an empty stomach , preferably at bedtime .
In treatment - experienced adult patients : Coadministration of REYATAZ with efavirenz in treatment - experienced patients is not recommended due to decreased atazanavir exposure .
Protease Inhibitors : saquinavir ( soft gelatin capsules ) ↑ saquinavir Appropriate dosing recommendations for this combination , with or without ritonavir , with respect to efficacy and safety have not been established .
In a clinical study , saquinavir 1200 mg coadministered with REYATAZ 400 mg and tenofovir 300 mg ( all given once daily ) plus nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors did not provide adequate efficacy [ see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
ritonavir ↑ atazanavir If REYATAZ is coadministered with ritonavir , it is recommended that REYATAZ 300 mg once daily be given with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food in adults .
See the complete prescribing information for ritonavir for information on drug interactions with ritonavir .
others ↑ other protease inhibitor Although not studied , the coadministration of REYATAZ / ritonavir and an additional protease inhibitor would be expected to increase exposure to the other protease inhibitor .
Such coadministration is not recommended .
HCV Antiviral Agents Protease Inhibitors : boceprevir ↓ atazanavir ↓ ritonavir Concomitant administration of boceprevir and atazanavir / ritonavir resulted in reduced steady - state exposures to atazanavir and ritonavir .
Coadministration of REYATAZ / ritonavir and boceprevir is not recommended .
Other Agents Antacids and buffered medications ↓ atazanavir Reduced plasma concentrations of atazanavir are expected if antacids , including buffered medications , are administered with REYATAZ .
REYATAZ should be administered 2 hours before or 1 hour after these medications .
Antiarrhythmics : amiodarone , bepridil , lidocaine ( systemic ) , quinidine ↑ amiodarone , bepridil , lidocaine ( systemic ) , quinidine Coadministration with REYATAZ has the potential to produce serious and / or life - threatening adverse events and has not been studied .
Caution is warranted and therapeutic concentration monitoring of these drugs is recommended if they are used concomitantly with REYATAZ .
Anticoagulants : warfarin ↑ warfarin Coadministration with REYATAZ has the potential to produce serious and / or life - threatening bleeding and has not been studied .
It is recommended that International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) be monitored .
Antidepressants : tricyclic antidepressants ↑ tricyclic antidepressants Coadministration with REYATAZ has the potential to produce serious and / or life - threatening adverse events and has not been studied .
Concentration monitoring of these drugs is recommended if they are used concomitantly with REYATAZ .
trazodone ↑ trazodone Concomitant use of trazodone and REYATAZ with or without ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of trazodone .
Nausea , dizziness , hypotension , and syncope have been observed following coadministration of trazodone and ritonavir .
If trazodone is used with a CYP3A4 inhibitor such as REYATAZ , the combination should be used with caution and a lower dose of trazodone should be considered .
Antiepileptics : carbamazepine ↓ atazanavir ↑ carbamazepine Plasma concentrations of atazanavir may be decreased when carbamazepine is administered with REYATAZ without ritonavir .
Coadministration of carbamazepine and REYATAZ without ritonavir is not recommended .
Ritonavir may increase plasma levels of carbamazepine .
If patients beginning treatment with REYATAZ / ritonavir have been titrated to a stable dose of carbamazepine , a dose reduction for carbamazepine may be necessary .
phenytoin , phenobarbital ↓ atazanavir ↓ phenytoin ↓ phenobarbital Plasma concentrations of atazanavir may be decreased when phenytoin or phenobarbital is administered with REYATAZ without ritonavir .
Coadministration of phenytoin or phenobarbital and REYATAZ without ritonavir is not recommended .
Ritonavir may decrease plasma levels of phenytoin and phenobarbital .
When REYATAZ with ritonavir is coadministered with either phenytoin or phenobarbital , a dose adjustment of phenytoin or phenobarbital may be required .
lamotrigine ↓ lamotrigine Coadministration of lamotrigine and REYATAZ with ritonavir may decrease lamotrigine plasma concentrations .
Dose adjustment of lamotrigine may be required when coadministered with REYATAZ and ritonavir .
Coadministration of lamotrigine and REYATAZ without ritonavir is not expected to decrease lamotrigine plasma concentrations .
No dose adjustment of lamotrigine is required when coadministered with REYATAZ without ritonavir .
Antifungals : ketoconazole , itraconazole REYATAZ / ritonavir : ↑ ketoconazole ↑ itraconazole Coadministration of ketoconazole has only been studied with REYATAZ without ritonavir ( negligible increase in atazanavir AUC and Cmax ) .
Due to the effect of ritonavir on ketoconazole , high doses of ketoconazole and itraconazole ( > 200 mg / day ) should be used cautiously with REYATAZ / ritonavir .
voriconazole REYATAZ / ritonavir in subjects with a functional CYP2C19 allele : ↓ voriconazole ↓ atazanavir REYATAZ / ritonavir in subjects without a functional CYP2C19 allele : ↑ voriconazole ↓ atazanavir The use of voriconazole in patients receiving REYATAZ / ritonavir is not recommended unless an assessment of the benefit / risk to the patient justifies the use of voriconazole .
Patients should be carefully monitored for voriconazole - associated adverse reactions and loss of either voriconazole or atazanavir efficacy during the coadministration of voriconazole and REYATAZ / ritonavir .
Coadministration of voriconazole with REYATAZ ( without ritonavir ) may affect atazanavir concentrations ; however , no data are available .
Antigout : colchicine ↑ colchicine The coadministration of REYATAZ with colchicine in patients with renal or hepatic impairment is not recommended .
Recommended adult dosage of colchicine when administered with REYATAZ : Treatment of gout flares : 0 . 6 mg ( 1 tablet ) for 1 dose , followed by 0 . 3 mg ( half tablet ) 1 hour later .
Not to be repeated before 3 days .
Prophylaxis of gout flares : If the original regimen was 0 . 6 mg twice a day , the regimen should be adjusted to 0 . 3 mg once a day .
If the original regimen was 0 . 6 mg once a day , the regimen should be adjusted to 0 . 3 mg once every other day .
Treatment of familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) : Maximum daily dose of 0 . 6 mg ( may be given as 0 . 3 mg twice a day ) .
Antimycobacterials : rifabutin ↑ rifabutin A rifabutin dose reduction of up to 75 % ( eg , 150 mg every other day or 3 times per week ) is recommended .
Increased monitoring for rifabutin - associated adverse reactions including neutropenia is warranted .
Antipsychotics : quetiapine and lurasidone ↑ quetiapine Init . iation of REYATAZ with ritonavir in patients taking quetiapine : Consider alternative antiretroviral therapy to avoid increases in quetiapine exposures .
If coadministration is necessary , reduce the quetiapine dose to 1 / 6 of the current dose and monitor for quetiapine - associated adverse reactions .
Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for recommendations on adverse reaction monitoring .
Initiation of quetiapine in patients taking REYATAZ with ritonavir : Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for initial dosing and titration of quetiapine .
REYATAZ ↑ lurasidone REYATAZ without ritonavir If coadministration is necessary , reduce the lurasidone dose .
Refer to the lurasidone prescribing information for concomitant use with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors REYATAZ / ritonavir ↑ lurasidone REYATAZ / ritonavir Use of lurasidone is contraindicated .
Benzodiazepines : parenterally administered midazolamb ↑ midazolam Concomitant use of parenteral midazolam with REYATAZ may increase plasma concentrations of midazolam .
Coadministration should be done in a setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and appropriate medical management in case of respiratory depression and / or prolonged sedation .
Dosage reduction for midazolam should be considered , especially if more than a single dose of midazolam is administered .
Coadministration of oral midazolam with REYATAZ is CONTRAINDICATED .
Calcium channel blockers : diltiazem ↑ diltiazem and desacetyl - diltiazem Caution is warranted .
A dose reduction of diltiazem by 50 % should be considered .
ECG monitoring is recommended .
Coadministration of REYATAZ / ritonavir with diltiazem has not been studied .
felodipine , nifedipine , nicardipine , and verapamil ↑ calcium channel blocker Caution is warranted .
Dose titration of the calcium channel blocker should be considered .
ECG monitoring is recommended .
Endothelin receptor antagonists : bosentan ↓ atazanavir ↑ bosentan Plasma concentrations of atazanavir may be decreased when bosentan is administered with REYATAZ without ritonavir .
Coadministration of bosentan and REYATAZ without ritonavir is not recommended .
Coadministration of bosentan in adult patients on REYATAZ / ritonavir : For patients who have been receiving REYATAZ / ritonavir for at least 10 days , start bosentan at 62 . 5 mg once daily or every other day based on individual tolerability .
Coadministration of REYATAZ / ritonavir in adult patients on bosentan : Discontinue bosentan at least 36 hours before starting REYATAZ / ritonavir .
At least 10 days after starting REYATAZ / ritonavir , resume bosentan at 62 . 5 mg once daily or every other day based on individual tolerability .
HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors : atorvastatin , rosuvastatin ↑ atorvastatin ↑ rosuvastatin Titrate atorvastatin dose carefully and use the lowest necessary dose .
Rosuvastatin dose should not exceed 10 mg / day .
The risk of myopathy , including rhabdomyolysis , may be increased when HIV protease inhibitors , including REYATAZ , are used in combination with these drugs .
H2 ‑ Receptor antagonists ↓ atazanavir Plasma concentrations of atazanavir were substantially decreased when REYATAZ 400 mg once daily was administered simultaneously with famotidine 40 mg twice daily in adults , which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance .
In treatment - naive adult patients : REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily with food should be administered simultaneously with , and / or at least 10 hours after , a dose of the H2 - receptor antagonist ( H2RA ) .
An H2RA dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg once daily up to a dose comparable to famotidine 40 mg twice daily can be used with REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg in treatment - naive patients .
OR For patients unable to tolerate ritonavir , REYATAZ 400 mg once daily with food should be administered at least 2 hours before and at least 10 hours after a dose of the H2RA .
No single dose of the H2RA should exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg , and the total daily dose should not exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 40 mg .
The use of REYATAZ without ritonavir in pregnant women is not recommended .
In treatment - experienced adult patients : Whenever an H2RA is given to a patient receiving REYATAZ with ritonavir , the H2RA dose should not exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg twice daily , and the REYATAZ and ritonavir doses should be administered simultaneously with , and / or at least 10 hours after , the dose of the H2RA .
• REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily ( all as a single dose with food ) if taken with an H2RA .
• REYATAZ 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily ( all as a single dose with food ) if taken with both tenofovir and an H2RA .
• REYATAZ 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily ( all as a single dose with food ) if taken with either tenofovir or an H2RA for pregnant women during the second and third trimester .
REYATAZ is not recommended for pregnant women during the second and third trimester taking REYATAZ with both tenofovir and an H2RA .
Hormonal contraceptives : ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate or norethindrone ↓ ethinyl estradiol ↑ norgestimatec ↑ ethinyl estradiol ↑ norethindroned Use with caution if coadministration of REYATAZ or REYATAZ / ritonavir with oral contraceptives is considered .
If an oral contraceptive is administered with REYATAZ plus ritonavir , it is recommended that the oral contraceptive contain at least 35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol .
If REYATAZ is administered without ritonavir , the oral contraceptive should contain no more than 30 mcg of ethinyl estradiol .
Potential safety risks include substantial increases in progesterone exposure .
The long - term effects of increases in concentration of the progestational agent are unknown and could increase the risk of insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , and acne .
Coadministration of REYATAZ or REYATAZ / ritonavir with other hormonal contraceptives ( eg , contraceptive patch , contraceptive vaginal ring , or injectable contraceptives ) or oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norethindrone or norgestimate , or less than 25 mcg of ethinyl estradiol , has not been studied ; therefore , alternative methods of contraception are recommended .
Immunosuppressants : cyclosporine , sirolimus , tacrolimus ↑ immunosuppressants Therapeutic concentration monitoring is recommended for these immunosuppressants when coadministered with REYATAZ .
Inhaled beta agonist : salmeterol ↑ salmeterol Coadministration of salmeterol with REYATAZ is not recommended .
Concomitant use of salmeterol and REYATAZ may result in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse reactions associated with salmeterol , including QT prolongation , palpitations , and sinus tachycardia .
Inhaled / nasal steroid : fluticasone REYATAZ ↑ fluticasone Concomitant use of fluticasone propionate and REYATAZ ( without ritonavir ) may increase plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate .
Use with caution .
Consider alternatives to fluticasone propionate , particularly for long - term use .
REYATAZ / ritonavir ↑ fluticasone Concomitant use of fluticasone propionate and REYATAZ / ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate , resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations .
Systemic corticosteroid effects , including Cushing ’ s syndrome and adrenal suppression , have been reported during postmarketing use in patients receiving ritonavir and inhaled or intranasally administered fluticasone propionate .
Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and REYATAZ / ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Macrolide antibiotics : clarithromycin ↑ clarithromycin ↓ 14 - OH clarithromycin ↑ atazanavir Increased concentrations of clarithromycin may cause QTc prolongations ; therefore , a dose reduction of clarithromycin by 50 % should be considered when it is coadministered with REYATAZ .
In addition , concentrations of the active metabolite 14 - OH clarithromycin are significantly reduced ; consider alternative therapy for indications other than infections due to Mycobacterium avium complex .
Coadministration of REYATAZ / ritonavir with clarithromycin has not been studied .
Opioids : Buprenorphine ↑ buprenorphine ↑ norbuprenorphine Coadministration of buprenorphine and REYATAZ with or without ritonavir increases the plasma concentration of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine .
Coadministration of REYATAZ plus ritonavir with buprenorphine warrants clinical monitoring for sedation and cognitive effects .
A dose reduction of buprenorphine may be considered .
Coadministration of buprenorphine and REYATAZ with ritonavir is not expected to decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations .
Coadministration of buprenorphine and REYATAZ without ritonavir may decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations .
The coadministration of REYATAZ and buprenorphine without ritonavir is not recommended .
PDE5 inhibitors : sildenafil , tadalafil , vardenafil ↑ sildenafil ↑ tadalafil ↑ vardenafil Coadministration with REYATAZ has not been studied but may result in an increase in PDE5 inhibitor - associated adverse reactions , including hypotension , syncope , visual disturbances , and priapism .
Use of PDE5 inhibitors for pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) : Use of REVATIO ® ( sildenafil ) for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension ( PAH ) is contraindicated with REYATAZ [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) ] .
The following dose adjustments are recommended for the use of ADCIRCA ® ( tadalafil ) with REYATAZ : Coadministration of ADCIRCA ® in patients on REYATAZ ( with or without ritonavir ) : • For patients receiving REYATAZ ( with or without ritonavir ) for at least one week , start ADCIRCA ® at 20 mg once daily .
Increase to 40 mg once daily based on individual tolerability .
Coadministration of REYATAZ ( with or without ritonavir ) in patients on ADCIRCA ® : • Avoid the use of ADCIRCA ® when starting REYATAZ ( with or without ritonavir ) .
Stop ADCIRCA ® at least 24 hours before starting REYATAZ ( with or without ritonavir ) .
At least one week after starting REYATAZ ( with or without ritonavir ) , resume ADCIRCA ® at 20 mg once daily .
Increase to 40 mg once daily based on individual tolerability .
Use of PDE5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction : Use VIAGRA ® ( sildenafil ) with caution at reduced doses of 25 mg every 48 hours with increased monitoring for adverse events .
Use CIALIS ® ( tadalafil ) with caution at reduced doses of 10 mg every 72 hours with increased monitoring for adverse events .
REYATAZ / ritonavir : Use vardenafil with caution at reduced doses of no more than 2 . 5 mg every 72 hours with increased monitoring for adverse reactions .
REYATAZ : Use vardenafil with caution at reduced doses of no more than 2 . 5 mg every 24 hours with increased monitoring for adverse reactions .
Proton - pump inhibitors : omeprazole ↓ atazanavir Plasma concentrations of atazanavir were substantially decreased when REYATAZ 400 mg or REYATAZ 300 mg / ritonavir 100 mg once daily was administered with omeprazole 40 mg once daily in adults , which may result in loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance .
In treatment - naive adult patients : The proton - pump inhibitor ( PPI ) dose should not exceed a dose comparable to omeprazole 20 mg and must be taken approximately 12 hours prior to the REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg dose .
In treatment - experienced adult patients : The use of PPIs in treatment - experienced patients receiving REYATAZ is not recommended .
7 . 4 Drugs with No Observed Interactions with REYATAZ No clinically significant drug interactions were observed when REYATAZ was coadministered with methadone , fluconazole , acetaminophen , atenolol , or the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors lamivudine or zidovudine [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , TABLES 21 AND 22 ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to REYATAZ during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry ( APR ) at 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
Risk Summary Atazanavir has been evaluated in a limited number of women during pregnancy .
Available human and animal data suggest that atazanavir does not increase the risk of major birth defects overall compared to the background rate [ see DATA ] .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
No treatment - related malformations were observed in rats and rabbits , for which the atazanavir exposures were 0 . 7 - 1 . 2 times of those at the human clinical dose ( 300 mg / day atazanavir boosted with 100 mg / day ritonavir ) .
When atazanavir was administered to rats during pregnancy and throughout lactation , reversible neonatal growth retardation was observed [ see DATA ] .
Clinical Considerations Dose Adjustments during Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period • REYATAZ must be administered with ritonavir in pregnant women .
• For pregnant patients , no dosage adjustment is required for REYATAZ with the following exceptions : • For treatment - experienced pregnant women during the second or third trimester , when REYATAZ is coadministered with either an H 2 - receptor antagonist or tenofovir , REYATAZ 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily is recommended .
There are insufficient data to recommend a REYATAZ dose for use with both an H 2 - receptor antagonist and tenofovir in treatment - experienced pregnant women .
• No dosage adjustment is required for postpartum patients .
However , patients should be closely monitored for adverse events because atazanavir exposures could be higher during the first 2 months after delivery [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 5 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Maternal Adverse Reactions Cases of lactic acidosis syndrome , sometimes fatal , and symptomatic hyperlactatemia have occurred in pregnant women using REYATAZ in combination with nucleoside analogues , which are associated with an increased risk of lactic acidosis syndrome .
Hyperbilirubinemia occurs frequently in patients who take REYATAZ [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 3 ) ] , including pregnant women [ see DATA ] .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risks of lactic acidosis syndrome and hyperbilirubinemia .
Fetal / Neonatal Adverse Reactions All infants , including neonates exposed to REYATAZ in utero , should be monitored for the development of severe hyperbilirubinemia during the first few days of life [ see DATA ] .
Data Human Data In clinical trial AI424 - 182 , REYATAZ / ritonavir ( 300 / 100 mg or 400 / 100 mg ) in combination with zidovudine / lamivudine was administered to 41 HIV - infected pregnant women during the second or third trimester .
Among the 39 women who completed the study , 38 women achieved an HIV RNA less than 50 copies / mL at time of delivery .
Six of 20 ( 30 % ) women on REYATAZ / ritonavir 300 / 100 mg and 13 of 21 ( 62 % ) women on REYATAZ / ritonavir 400 / 100 mg experienced hyperbilirubinemia ( total bilirubin greater than or equal to 2 . 6 times ULN ) .
There were no cases of lactic acidosis observed in clinical trial AI424 - 182 .
Atazanavir drug concentrations in fetal umbilical cord blood were approximately 12 % to 19 % of maternal concentrations .
Among the 40 infants born to 40 HIV - infected pregnant women , all had test results that were negative for HIV - 1 DNA at the time of delivery and / or during the first 6 months postpartum .
All 40 infants received antiretroviral prophylactic treatment containing zidovudine .
No evidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia ( total bilirubin levels greater than 20 mg / dL ) or acute or chronic bilirubin encephalopathy was observed among neonates in this study .
However , 10 / 36 ( 28 % ) infants ( 6 greater than or equal to 38 weeks gestation and 4 less than 38 weeks gestation ) had bilirubin levels of 4 mg / dL or greater within the first day of life .
Lack of ethnic diversity was a study limitation .
In the study population , 33 / 40 ( 83 % ) infants were Black / African American , who have a lower incidence of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia than Caucasians and Asians .
In addition , women with Rh incompatibility were excluded , as well as women who had a previous infant who developed hemolytic disease and / or had neonatal pathologic jaundice ( requiring phototherapy ) .
Additionally , of the 38 infants who had glucose samples collected in the first day of life , 3 had adequately collected serum glucose samples with values of less than 40 mg / dL that could not be attributed to maternal glucose intolerance , difficult delivery , or sepsis .
Based on prospective reports from the APR of approximately 1600 live births following exposure to atazanavir - containing regimens ( including 1037 live births in infants exposed in the first trimester and 569 exposed in second / third trimesters ) , there was no difference between atazanavir and overall birth defects compared with the background birth defect rate .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % .
Animal Data In animal reproduction studies , there was no evidence of mortality or teratogenicity in offspring born to animals at systemic drug exposure levels ( AUC ) 0 . 7 ( in rabbits ) to 1 . 2 ( in rats ) times those observed at the human clinical dose ( 300 mg / day atazanavir boosted with 100 mg / day ritonavir ) .
In pre - and postnatal development studies in the rat , atazanavir caused neonatal growth retardation during lactation that reversed after weaning .
Maternal drug exposure at this dose was 1 . 3 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical exposure .
Minimal maternal toxicity occurred at this exposure level .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV - 1 infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV - 1 .
Atazanavir has been detected in human milk .
No data are available regarding atazanavir effects on milk production .
Atazanavir was present in the milk of lactating rats and was associated with neonatal growth retardation that reversed after weaning .
Because of both the potential for HIV - 1 transmission and the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants , advise women not to breastfeed .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use REYATAZ is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV - 1 infection in pediatric patients 3 months of age and older weighing at least 5 kg .
REYATAZ is not recommended for use in pediatric patients below the age of 3 months due to the risk of kernicterus [ see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ( 1 ) ] .
All REYATAZ contraindications , warnings , and precautions apply to pediatric patients [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 ) ] .
The safety , pharmacokinetic profile , and virologic response of REYATAZ in pediatric patients at least 3 months of age and older weighing at least 5 kg were established in three open - label , multicenter clinical trials : PACTG 1020 A , AI424 - 451 , and AI424 - 397 [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) and CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
The safety profile in pediatric patients was generally similar to that observed in adults [ see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 3 , 2 . 4 ) for dosing recommendations for the use of REYATAZ capsules and REYATAZ oral powder in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of REYATAZ did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
Based on a comparison of mean single - dose pharmacokinetic values for Cmax and AUC , a dose adjustment based upon age is not recommended .
In general , appropriate caution should be exercised in the administration and monitoring of REYATAZ in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Age / Gender A study of the pharmacokinetics of atazanavir was performed in young ( n = 29 ; 18 - 40 years ) and elderly ( n = 30 ; ≥ 65 years ) healthy subjects .
There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic differences observed due to age or gender .
8 . 7 Impaired Renal Function REYATAZ is not recommended for use in HIV - treatment - experienced patients with end stage renal disease managed with hemodialysis [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 6 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 8 Impaired Hepatic Function REYATAZ is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
REYATAZ / ritonavir is not recommended in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 7 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Human experience of acute overdose with REYATAZ is limited .
Single doses up to 1200 mg ( three times the 400 mg maximum recommended dose ) have been taken by healthy volunteers without symptomatic untoward effects .
A single self - administered overdose of 29 . 2 g of REYATAZ in an HIV - infected patient ( 73 times the 400 - mg recommended dose ) was associated with asymptomatic bifascicular block and PR interval prolongation .
These events resolved spontaneously .
At REYATAZ doses resulting in high atazanavir exposures , jaundice due to indirect ( unconjugated ) hyperbilirubinemia ( without associated liver function test changes ) or PR interval prolongation may be observed [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 3 ) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Treatment of overdosage with REYATAZ should consist of general supportive measures , including monitoring of vital signs and ECG , and observations of the patient ’ s clinical status .
If indicated , elimination of unabsorbed atazanavir should be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage .
Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid removal of unabsorbed drug .
There is no specific antidote for overdose with REYATAZ .
Since atazanavir is extensively metabolized by the liver and is highly protein bound , dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of this medicine .

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Atazanavir is an HIV - 1 antiretroviral drug [ see MICROBIOLOGY ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology Concentration - and dose - dependent prolongation of the PR interval in the electrocardiogram has been observed in healthy volunteers receiving atazanavir .
In a placebo - controlled study ( AI424 - 076 ) , the mean ( ± SD ) maximum change in PR interval from the predose value was 24 ( ± 15 ) msec following oral dosing with 400 mg of atazanavir ( n = 65 ) compared to 13 ( ± 11 ) msec following dosing with placebo ( n = 67 ) .
The PR interval prolongations in this study were asymptomatic .
There is limited information on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction in humans between atazanavir and other drugs that prolong the PR interval of the electrocardiogram [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Electrocardiographic effects of atazanavir were determined in a clinical pharmacology study of 72 healthy subjects .
Oral doses of 400 mg ( maximum recommended dosage ) and 800 mg ( twice the maximum recommended dosage ) were compared with placebo ; there was no concentration - dependent effect of atazanavir on the QTc interval ( using Fridericia ’ s correction ) .
In 1793 HIV - infected patients receiving antiretroviral regimens , QTc prolongation was comparable in the atazanavir and comparator regimens .
No atazanavir - treated healthy subject or HIV - infected patient in clinical trials had a QTc interval > 500 msec [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of atazanavir were evaluated in healthy adult volunteers and in HIV - infected patients after administration of REYATAZ 400 mg once daily and after administration of REYATAZ 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily ( see Table 17 ) .

Figure 1 : Mean ( SD ) Steady - State Plasma Concentrations of Atazanavir 400 mg ( n = 13 ) and 300 mg with Ritonavir ( n = 10 ) for HIV - Infected Adult Patients [ Reyataz Fig 1 ] Absorption Atazanavir is rapidly absorbed with a Tmax of approximately 2 . 5 hours .
Atazanavir demonstrates nonlinear pharmacokinetics with greater than dose - proportional increases in AUC and Cmax values over the dose range of 200 to 800 mg once daily .
Steady state is achieved between Days 4 and 8 , with an accumulation of approximately 2 . 3 fold .
Food Effect Administration of REYATAZ with food enhances bioavailability and reduces pharmacokinetic variability .
Administration of a single 400 - mg dose of REYATAZ with a light meal ( 357 kcal , 8 . 2 g fat , 10 . 6 g protein ) resulted in a 70 % increase in AUC and 57 % increase in Cmax relative to the fasting state .
Administration of a single 400 - mg dose of REYATAZ with a high - fat meal ( 721 kcal , 37 . 3 g fat , 29 . 4 g protein ) resulted in a mean increase in AUC of 35 % with no change in Cmax relative to the fasting state .
Administration of REYATAZ with either a light meal or high - fat meal decreased the coefficient of variation of AUC and Cmax by approximately one - half compared to the fasting state .
Coadministration of a single 300 - mg dose of REYATAZ and a 100 - mg dose of ritonavir with a light meal ( 336 kcal , 5 . 1 g fat , 9 . 3 g protein ) resulted in a 33 % increase in the AUC and a 40 % increase in both the Cmax and the 24 - hour concentration of atazanavir relative to the fasting state .
Coadministration with a high - fat meal ( 951 kcal , 54 . 7 g fat , 35 . 9 g protein ) did not affect the AUC of atazanavir relative to fasting conditions and the Cmax was within 11 % of fasting values .
The 24 - hour concentration following a high - fat meal was increased by approximately 33 % due to delayed absorption ; the median Tmaxincreased from 2 . 0 to 5 . 0 hours .
Coadministration of REYATAZ with ritonavir with either a light or a high - fat meal decreased the coefficient of variation of AUC and Cmax by approximately 25 % compared to the fasting state .
Distribution Atazanavir is 86 % bound to human serum proteins and protein binding is independent of concentration .
Atazanavir binds to both alpha - 1 - acid glycoprotein ( AAG ) and albumin to a similar extent ( 89 % and 86 % , respectively ) .
In a multiple - dose study in HIV - infected patients dosed with REYATAZ 400 mg once daily with a light meal for 12 weeks , atazanavir was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and semen .
The cerebrospinal fluid / plasma ratio for atazanavir ( n = 4 ) ranged between 0 . 0021 and 0 . 0226 and seminal fluid / plasma ratio ( n = 5 ) ranged between 0 . 11 and 4 . 42 .
Metabolism Atazanavir is extensively metabolized in humans .
The major biotransformation pathways of atazanavir in humans consisted of monooxygenation and dioxygenation .
Other minor biotransformation pathways for atazanavir or its metabolites consisted of glucuronidation , N - dealkylation , hydrolysis , and oxygenation with dehydrogenation .
Two minor metabolites of atazanavir in plasma have been characterized .
Neither metabolite demonstrated in vitro antiviral activity .
In vitro studies using human liver microsomes suggested that atazanavir is metabolized by CYP3A .
Elimination Following a single 400 - mg dose of 14 C - atazanavir , 79 % and 13 % of the total radioactivity was recovered in the feces and urine , respectively .
Unchanged drug accounted for approximately 20 % and 7 % of the administered dose in the feces and urine , respectively .
The mean elimination half - life of atazanavir in healthy volunteers ( n = 214 ) and HIV - infected adult patients ( n = 13 ) was approximately 7 hours at steady state following a dose of 400 mg daily with a light meal .
Specific Populations Renal Impairment In healthy subjects , the renal elimination of unchanged atazanavir was approximately 7 % of the administered dose .
REYATAZ has been studied in adult subjects with severe renal impairment ( n = 20 ) , including those on hemodialysis , at multiple doses of 400 mg once daily .
The mean atazanavir Cmaxwas 9 % lower , AUC was 19 % higher , and Cmin was 96 % higher in subjects with severe renal impairment not undergoing hemodialysis ( n = 10 ) , than in age - , weight - , and gender - matched subjects with normal renal function .
In a 4 - hour dialysis session , 2 . 1 % of the administered dose was removed .
When atazanavir was administered either prior to , or following hemodialysis ( n = 10 ) , the geometric means for Cmax , AUC , and Cmin were approximately 25 % to 43 % lower compared to subjects with normal renal function .
The mechanism of this decrease is unknown .
REYATAZ is not recommended for use in HIV - treatment - experienced patients with end stage renal disease managed with hemodialysis [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
Hepatic Impairment REYATAZ has been studied in adult subjects with moderate - to - severe hepatic impairment ( 14 Child - Pugh B and 2 Child - Pugh C subjects ) after a single 400 - mg dose .
The mean AUC ( 0 - ∞ ) was 42 % greater in subjects with impaired hepatic function than in healthy volunteers .
The mean half - life of atazanavir in hepatically impaired subjects was 12 . 1 hours compared to 6 . 4 hours in healthy volunteers .
A dose reduction to 300 mg is recommended for patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class B ) who have not experienced prior virologic failure as increased concentrations of atazanavir are expected .
REYATAZ is not recommended for use in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
The pharmacokinetics of REYATAZ in combination with ritonavir has not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment ; thus , coadministration of REYATAZ with ritonavir is not recommended for use in patients with any degree of hepatic impairment [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 7 ) ] .

Atazanavir is also a direct inhibitor for UGT1A1 ( Ki = 1 . 9 µM ) and CYP2C8 ( Ki = 2 . 1 µM ) .
Atazanavir has been shown in vivo not to induce its own metabolism nor to increase the biotransformation of some drugs metabolized by CYP3A .
In a multiple - dose study , REYATAZ decreased the urinary ratio of endogenous 6β - OH cortisol to cortisol versus baseline , indicating that CYP3A production was not induced .
Clinically significant interactions are not expected between atazanavir and substrates of CYP2C19 , CYP2C9 , CYP2D6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2A6 , CYP1A2 , or CYP2E1 .
Clinically significant interactions are not expected between atazanavir when administered with ritonavir and substrates of CYP2C8 .
See the complete prescribing information for ritonavir for information on other potential drug interactions with ritonavir .
Based on known metabolic profiles , clinically significant drug interactions are not expected between REYATAZ and dapsone , trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole , azithromycin , or erythromycin .
REYATAZ does not interact with substrates of CYP2D6 ( eg , nortriptyline , desipramine , metoprolol ) .
Drug interaction studies were performed with REYATAZ and other drugs likely to be coadministered and some drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interactions .
The effects of coadministration of REYATAZ on the AUC , Cmax , and Cmin are summarized in Tables 21 and 22 .
Neither didanosine EC nor diltiazem had a significant effect on atazanavir exposures ( see Table 22 for effect of atazanavir on didanosine EC or diltiazem exposures ) .
REYATAZ did not have a significant effect on the exposures of didanosine ( when administered as the buffered tablet ) , stavudine , or fluconazole .
For information regarding clinical recommendations , see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7 ) .

b All drugs were given under fasted conditions .
c REYATAZ 300 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg once daily coadministered with famotidine 40 mg twice daily resulted in atazanavir geometric mean Cmax that was similar and AUC and Cmin values that were 1 . 79 - and 4 . 46 - fold higher relative to REYATAZ 400 mg once daily alone .
d Similar results were noted when famotidine 20 mg BID was administered 2 hours after and 10 hours before atazanavir 300 mg and ritonavir 100 mg plus tenofovir 300 mg .
e Atazanavir / ritonavir / tenofovir was administered after a light meal .
f Study was conducted in HIV - infected individuals .
g Compared with atazanavir 400 mg historical data without nevirapine ( n = 13 ) , the ratio of geometric means ( 90 % confidence intervals ) for Cmax , AUC , and Cmin were 1 . 42 ( 0 . 98 , 2 . 05 ) , 1 . 64 ( 1 . 11 , 2 . 42 ) , and 1 . 25 ( 0 . 66 , 2 . 36 ) , respectively , for atazanavir / ritonavir 300 / 100 mg ; and 2 . 02 ( 1 . 42 , 2 . 87 ) , 2 . 28 ( 1 . 54 , 3 . 38 ) , and 1 . 80 ( 0 . 94 , 3 . 45 ) , respectively , for atazanavir / ritonavir 400 / 100 mg .
h Parallel group design ; n = 23 for atazanavir / ritonavir plus nevirapine , n = 22 for atazanavir 300 mg / ritonavir 100 mg without nevirapine .
Subjects were treated with nevirapine prior to study entry .
i Omeprazole 40 mg was administered on an empty stomach 2 hours before REYATAZ .
j Omeprazole 20 mg was administered 30 minutes prior to a light meal in the morning and REYATAZ 300 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg in the evening after a light meal , separated by 12 hours from omeprazole .
k REYATAZ 300 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg once daily separated by 12 hours from omeprazole 20 mg daily resulted in increases in atazanavir geometric mean AUC ( 10 % ) and Cmin ( 2 . 4 - fold ) , with a decrease in Cmax ( 29 % ) relative to REYATAZ 400 mg once daily in the absence of omeprazole ( study days 1 – 6 ) .
l Omeprazole 20 mg was given 30 minutes prior to a light meal in the morning and REYATAZ 400 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg once daily after a light meal , 1 hour after omeprazole .
Effects on atazanavir concentrations were similar when REYATAZ 400 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg was separated from omeprazole 20 mg by 12 hours .
m REYATAZ 400 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg once daily administered with omeprazole 20 mg once daily resulted in increases in atazanavir geometric mean AUC ( 32 % ) and Cmin ( 3 . 3 - fold ) , with a decrease in Cmax ( 26 % ) relative to REYATAZ 400 mg once daily in the absence of omeprazole ( study days 1 – 6 ) .
n Compared with atazanavir 400 mg QD historical data , administration of atazanavir / ritonavir 300 / 100 mg QD increased the atazanavir geometric mean values of Cmax , AUC , and Cmin by 18 % , 103 % , and 671 % , respectively .
o Note that similar results were observed in studies where administration of tenofovir and REYATAZ was separated by 12 hours .
p Ratio of atazanavir plus ritonavir plus tenofovir to atazanavir plus ritonavir .
Atazanavir 300 mg plus ritonavir 100 mg results in higher atazanavir exposure than atazanavir 400 mg ( see footnote o ) .
The geometric mean values of atazanavir pharmacokinetic parameters when coadministered with ritonavir and tenofovir were : Cmax = 3190 ng / mL , AUC = 34459 ng • h / mL , and Cmin = 491 ng / mL .

1 protease inhibitor ( PI ) .
The compound selectively inhibits the virus - specific processing of viral Gag and Gag - Pol polyproteins in HIV - 1 infected cells , thus preventing formation of mature virions .
Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Atazanavir exhibits anti - HIV - 1 activity with a mean 50 % effective concentration ( EC50 ) in the absence of human serum of 2 to 5 nM against a variety of laboratory and clinical HIV - 1 isolates grown in peripheral blood mononuclear cells , macrophages , CEM - SS cells , and MT - 2 cells .
ATV has activity against HIV - 1 Group M subtype viruses A , B , C , D , AE , AG , F , G , and J isolates in cell culture .
ATV has variable activity against HIV - 2 isolates ( 1 . 9 - 32 nM ) , with EC50 values above the EC50 values of failure isolates .
Two - drug combination antiviral activity studies with ATV showed no antagonism in cell culture with NNRTIs ( delavirdine , efavirenz , and nevirapine ) , PIs ( amprenavir , indinavir , lopinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , and saquinavir ) , NRTIs ( abacavir , didanosine , emtricitabine , lamivudine , stavudine , tenofovir , zalcitabine , and zidovudine ) , the HIV - 1 fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide , and two compounds used in the treatment of viral hepatitis , adefovir and ribavirin , without enhanced cytotoxicity .
Resistance In Cell Culture : HIV - 1 isolates with a decreased susceptibility to ATV have been selected in cell culture and obtained from patients treated with ATV or atazanavir / ritonavir ( ATV / RTV ) .
HIV - 1 isolates with 93 - to 183 - fold reduced susceptibility to ATV from three different viral strains were selected in cell culture by 5 months .
The substitutions in these HIV - 1 viruses that contributed to ATV resistance include I50L , N88S , I84V , A71V , and M46I .
Changes were also observed at the protease cleavage sites following drug selection .
Recombinant viruses containing the I50L substitution without other major PI substitutions were growth impaired and displayed increased susceptibility in cell culture to other PIs ( amprenavir , indinavir , lopinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , and saquinavir ) .
The I50L and I50V substitutions yielded selective resistance to ATV and amprenavir , respectively , and did not appear to be cross - resistant .

A summary of the number of virologic failures and virologic failure isolates with ATV resistance in each arm is shown in Table 23 .

In the ATV / RTV arm , one of the virologic failure isolates had a 56 - fold decrease in ATV susceptibility emerge on therapy with the development of PI resistance - associated substitutions L10F , V32I , K43T , M46I , A71I , G73S , I85I / V , and L90M .
The NRTI resistance - associated substitution M184V also emerged on treatment in this isolate conferring emtricitabine resistance .
Two ATV / RTV - virologic failure isolates had baseline phenotypic ATV resistance and IAS - defined major PI resistance - associated substitutions at baseline .
The I50L substitution emerged on study in one of these failure isolates and was associated with a 17 - fold decrease in ATV susceptibility from baseline and the other failure isolate with baseline ATV resistance and PI substitutions ( M46M / I and I84I / V ) had additional IAS - defined major PI substitutions ( V32I , M46I , and I84V ) emerge on ATV treatment associated with a 3 - fold decrease in ATV susceptibility from baseline .
Five of the treatment failure isolates in the ATV / RTV arm developed phenotypic emtricitabine resistance with the emergence of either the M184I ( n = 1 ) or the M184V ( n = 4 ) substitution on therapy and none developed phenotypic tenofovir disoproxil resistance .
In the LPV / RTV arm , one of the virologic failure patient isolates had a 69 - fold decrease in LPV susceptibility emerge on therapy with the development of PI substitutions L10V , V11I , I54V , G73S , and V82A in addition to baseline PI substitutions L10L / I , V32I , I54I / V , A71I , G73G / S , V82V / A , L89V , and L90M .
Six LPV / RTV virologic failure isolates developed the M184V substitution and phenotypic emtricitabine resistance and two developed phenotypic tenofovir disoproxil resistance .
Clinical Studies of Treatment - Naive Patients Receiving REYATAZ 400 mg without Ritonavir : ATV - resistant clinical isolates from treatment - naive patients who experienced virologic failure on REYATAZ 400 mg treatment without ritonavir often developed an I50L substitution ( after an average of 50 weeks of ATV therapy ) , often in combination with an A71V substitution , but also developed one or more other PI substitutions ( eg , V32I , L33F , G73S , V82A , I85V , or N88S ) with or without the I50L substitution .
In treatment - naive patients , viral isolates that developed the I50L substitution , without other major PI substitutions , showed phenotypic resistance to ATV but retained in cell culture susceptibility to other PIs ( amprenavir , indinavir , lopinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , and saquinavir ) ; however , there are no clinical data available to demonstrate the effect of the I50L substitution on the efficacy of subsequently administered PIs .
Clinical Studies of Treatment - Experienced Patients : In studies of treatment - experienced patients treated with ATV or ATV / RTV , most ATV - resistant isolates from patients who experienced virologic failure developed substitutions that were associated with resistance to multiple PIs and displayed decreased susceptibility to multiple PIs .
The most common protease substitutions to develop in the viral isolates of patients who failed treatment with ATV 300 mg once daily and RTV 100 mg once daily ( together with tenofovir and an NRTI ) included V32I , L33F / V / I , E35D / G , M46I / L , I50L , F53L / V , I54V , A71V / T / I , G73S / T / C , V82A / T / L , I85V , and L89V / Q / M / T .
Other substitutions that developed on ATV / RTV treatment including E34K / A / Q , G48V , I84V , N88S / D / T , and L90M occurred in less than 10 % of patient isolates .
Generally , if multiple PI resistance substitutions were present in the HIV - 1 virus of the patient at baseline , ATV resistance developed through substitutions associated with resistance to other PIs and could include the development of the I50L substitution .
The I50L substitution has been detected in treatment - experienced patients experiencing virologic failure after long - term treatment .
Protease cleavage site changes also emerged on ATV treatment but their presence did not correlate with the level of ATV resistance .
Clinical Studies of Pediatric Subjects in AI424 - 397 ( PRINCE I ) and AI424 - 451 ( PRINCE II ) : Treatment - emergent ATV / RTV resistance - associated amino acid substitution M36I in the protease was detected in the virus of one subject among treatment failures in AI424 - 397 .
In addition , three known resistance - associated substitutions for other PIs arose in the viruses from one subject each ( L19I / R , H69K / R , and I72I / V ) .
Reduced susceptibility to ATV , RTV , or ATV / RTV was not seen with these viruses .
In AI424 - 451 , ATV / RTV resistance - associated substitutions G16E , V82A / I / T , I84V , and / or L90M arose in the viruses of two subjects .
The virus population harboring the M46M / V , V82V / I , I84I / V , and L90L / M substitutions acquired phenotypic resistance to RTV ( RTV phenotypic fold - change of 3 . 5 , with a RTV cutoff of 2 . 5 - fold change ) .
However , these substitutions did not result in phenotypic resistance to ATV ( ATV phenotypic fold - change of < 1 . 8 , with an ATV cutoff of 2 . 2 - fold change ) .
Secondary PI resistance - associated amino acid substitutions also arose in the viruses of one subject each , including V11V / I , D30D / G , E35E / D , K45K / R , L63P / S , and I72I / T .
Q61D and Q61E / G emerged in the viruses of two subjects who failed treatment with ATV / RTV .
Viruses from nine subjects in the two studies developed NRTI resistance - associated substitutions : K65K / R ( n = 1 ) , M184V ( n = 7 ) , and T215I ( n = 1 ) .
Cross - Resistance Cross - resistance among PIs has been observed .
Baseline phenotypic and genotypic analyses of clinical isolates from ATV clinical trials of PI - experienced patients showed that isolates cross - resistant to multiple PIs were cross - resistant to ATV .
Greater than 90 % of the isolates with substitutions that included I84V or G48V were resistant to ATV .
Greater than 60 % of isolates containing L90M , G73S / T / C , A71V / T , I54V , M46I / L , or a change at V82 were resistant to ATV , and 38 % of isolates containing a D30N substitution in addition to other changes were resistant to ATV .
Isolates resistant to ATV were also cross - resistant to other PIs with > 90 % of the isolates resistant to indinavir , lopinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , and saquinavir , and 80 % resistant to amprenavir .
In treatment - experienced patients , PI - resistant viral isolates that developed the I50L substitution in addition to other PI resistance - associated substitution were also cross - resistant to other PIs .
Baseline Genotype / Phenotype and Virologic Outcome Analyses Genotypic and / or phenotypic analysis of baseline virus may aid in determining ATV susceptibility before initiation of ATV / RTV therapy .
An association between virologic response at 48 weeks and the number and type of primary PI resistance - associated substitutions detected in baseline HIV - 1 isolates from antiretroviral - experienced patients receiving ATV / RTV once daily or lopinavir ( LPV ) / RTV twice daily in Study AI424 - 045 is shown in Table 24 .
Overall , both the number and type of baseline PI substitutions affected response rates in treatment - experienced patients .
In the ATV / RTV group , patients had lower response rates when 3 or more baseline PI substitutions , including a substitution at position 36 , 71 , 77 , 82 , or 90 , were present compared to patients with 1 – 2 PI substitutions , including one of these substitutions .
Table 24 : HIV RNA Response by Number and Type of Baseline PI Substitution , Antiretroviral - Experienced Patients in Study AI424 - 045 , As - Treated Analysis a Primary substitutions include any change at D30 , V32 , M36 , M46 , I47 , G48 , I50 , I54 , A71 , G73 , V77 , V82 , I84 , N88 , and L90 .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long - term carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats were carried out with atazanavir for two years .
In the mouse study , drug - related increases in hepatocellular adenomas were found in females at 360 mg / kg / day .
The systemic drug exposure ( AUC ) at the NOAEL ( no observable adverse effect level ) in females , ( 120 mg / kg / day ) was 2 . 8 times and in males ( 80 mg / kg / day ) was 2 . 9 times higher than those in humans at the clinical dose ( 300 mg / day atazanavir boosted with 100 mg / day ritonavir , non - pregnant patients ) .
In the rat study , no drug - related increases in tumor incidence were observed at doses up to 1200 mg / kg / day , for which AUCs were 1 . 1 ( males ) or 3 . 9 ( females ) times those measured in humans at the clinical dose .
Mutagenesis Atazanavir tested positive in an in vitro clastogenicity test using primary human lymphocytes , in the absence and presence of metabolic activation .
Atazanavir tested negative in the in vitro Ames reverse - mutation assay , in vivo micronucleus and DNA repair tests in rats , and in vivo DNA damage test in rat duodenum ( comet assay ) .
Impairment of Fertility At the systemic drug exposure levels ( AUC ) 0 . 9 ( in male rats ) or 2 . 3 ( in female rats ) times that of the human clinical dose , ( 300 mg / day atazanavir boosted with 100 mg / day ritonavir ) significant effects on mating , fertility , or early embryonic development were not observed .

Study AI424 - 045 was a randomized , multicenter trial comparing REYATAZ ( 300 mg once daily ) with ritonavir ( 100 mg once daily ) to REYATAZ ( 400 mg once daily ) with saquinavir soft gelatin capsules ( 1200 mg once daily ) , and to lopinavir + ritonavir ( 400 / 100 mg twice daily ) , each in combination with tenofovir and one NRTI , in 347 ( of 358 randomized ) patients who experienced virologic failure on HAART regimens containing PIs , NNRTIs , and NRTIs .
The mean time of prior exposure to antiretrovirals was 139 weeks for PIs , 85 weeks for NNRTIs , and 283 weeks for NRTIs .
The mean age was 41 years ( range : 24 to 74 ) ; 60 % were Caucasian , and 78 % were male .
The mean baseline CD4 + cell count was 338 cells / mm3 ( range : 14 to 1543 cells / mm3 ) and the mean baseline plasma HIV - 1 RNA level was 4 . 4 log10 copies / mL ( range : 2 . 6 to 5 . 88 log10 copies / mL ) .
Treatment outcomes through Week 48 for the REYATAZ / ritonavir and lopinavir / ritonavir treatment arms are presented in Table 29 .
REYATAZ / ritonavir and lopinavir / ritonavir were similar for the primary efficacy outcome measure of time - averaged difference in change from baseline in HIV RNA level .
Study AI424 - 045 was not large enough to reach a definitive conclusion that REYATAZ / ritonavir and lopinavir / ritonavir are equivalent on the secondary efficacy outcome measure of proportions below the HIV RNA lower limit of quantification [ see MICROBIOLOGY , TABLES 24 AND 25 ( 12 . 4 ) ] .

In Study AI424 - 045 , the mean change from baseline in plasma HIV - 1 RNA for REYATAZ 400 mg with saquinavir ( n = 115 ) was − 1 . 55 log10 copies / mL , and the time - averaged difference in change in HIV - 1 RNA levels versus lopinavir / ritonavir was 0 . 33 .
The corresponding mean increase in CD4 + cell count was 72 cells / mm3 .
Through 48 weeks of treatment , the proportion of patients in this treatment arm with plasma HIV - 1 RNA < 400 ( < 50 ) copies / mL was 38 % ( 26 % ) .
In this study , coadministration of REYATAZ and saquinavir did not provide adequate efficacy [ see DRUG INTERACTIONS ( 7 ) ] .
Study AI424 - 045 also compared changes from baseline in lipid values .
[ See ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 . 1 ) . ]
Study AI424 - 043 : Study AI424 - 043 was a randomized , open - label , multicenter trial comparing REYATAZ ( 400 mg once daily ) to lopinavir / ritonavir ( 400 / 100 mg twice daily ) , each in combination with two NRTIs , in 300 patients who experienced virologic failure to only one prior PI - containing regimen .
Through 48 weeks , the proportion of patients with plasma HIV - 1 RNA < 400 ( < 50 ) copies / mL was 49 % ( 35 % ) for patients randomized to REYATAZ ( n = 144 ) and 69 % ( 53 % ) for patients randomized to lopinavir / ritonavir ( n = 146 ) .
The mean change from baseline was − 1 . 59 log10 copies / mL in the REYATAZ treatment arm and − 2 . 02 log10 copies / mL in the lopinavir / ritonavir arm .
Based on the results of this study , REYATAZ without ritonavir was inferior to lopinavir / ritonavir in PI - experienced patients with prior virologic failure and is not recommended for such patients .
14 . 3 Pediatric Patients Pediatric Trials with REYATAZ Capsules Assessment of the pharmacokinetics , safety , tolerability , and virologic response of REYATAZ capsules was based on data from the open - label , multicenter clinical trial PACTG 1020 A which included patients from 6 years to 21 years of age .
In this study , 105 patients ( 43 antiretroviral - naive and 62 antiretroviral - experienced ) received once daily REYATAZ capsule formulation , with or without ritonavir , in combination with two NRTIs .
One - hundred five ( 105 ) patients ( 6 to less than 18 years of age ) treated with the REYATAZ capsule formulation , with or without ritonavir , were evaluated .
Using an ITT analysis , the overall proportions of antiretroviral - naive and - experienced patients with HIV RNA < 400 copies / mL at Week 96 were 51 % ( 22 / 43 ) and 34 % ( 21 / 62 ) , respectively .
The overall proportions of antiretroviral - naive and - experienced patients with HIV RNA < 50 copies / mL at Week 96 were 47 % ( 20 / 43 ) and 24 % ( 15 / 62 ) , respectively .
The median increase from baseline in absolute CD4 count at 96 weeks of therapy was 335 cells / mm3 in antiretroviral - naive patients and 220 cells / mm3 in antiretroviral - experienced patients .
Pediatric Trials with REYATAZ Oral Powder Assessment of the pharmacokinetics , safety , tolerability , and virologic response of REYATAZ oral powder was based on data from two open - label , multicenter clinical trials .
• AI424 - 397 ( PRINCE I ) : In pediatric patients from 3 months to less than 6 years of age • AI424 - 451 ( PRINCE II ) : In pediatric patients from 3 months to less than 11 years of age In these studies 155 patients ( 59 antiretroviral - naive and 96 antiretroviral - experienced ) received once daily REYATAZ oral powder and ritonavir , in combination with two NRTIs .
For inclusion in both trials , treatment - naive patients had to have genotypic sensitivity to REYATAZ and two NRTIs , and treatment - experienced patients had to have documented genotypic and phenotypic sensitivity at screening to REYATAZ and at least 2 NRTIs .
Patients exposed only to antiretrovirals in utero or intrapartum were considered treatment - naive .
Patients who received REYATAZ or REYATAZ / ritonavir at any time prior to study enrollment or who had a history of treatment failure on two or more protease inhibitors were excluded from the trials .
One hundred thirty - four ( 134 ) patients from both studies weighing 5 kg to less than 35 kg treated with REYATAZ oral powder with ritonavir were evaluated .
Patients 5 kg to less than 10 kg received either 150 mg or 200 mg REYATAZ and 80 mg ritonavir oral solution ; patients 10 kg to less than 15 kg received 200 mg REYATAZ and 80 mg ritonavir oral solution ; patients 15 kg to less than 25 kg received 250 mg REYATAZ and 80 mg ritonavir oral solution ; and patients 25 kg to less than 35 kg received 300 mg REYATAZ and 100 mg ritonavir .
Using a modified ITT analysis , the overall proportions of antiretroviral - naive and antiretroviral - experienced patients with HIV RNA < 400 copies / mL at Week 48 were 79 % ( 41 / 52 ) and 62 % ( 51 / 82 ) , respectively in patients who received REYATAZ oral powder with ritonavir .
The overall proportions of antiretroviral - naive and antiretroviral - experienced patients with HIV RNA < 50 copies / mL at Week 48 were 54 % ( 28 / 52 ) and 50 % ( 41 / 82 ) , respectively in patients who received REYATAZ oral powder with ritonavir .
The median increase from baseline in absolute CD4 count ( percent ) at 48 weeks of therapy ( last observation carried forward ) was 215 cells / mm3 ( 6 % ) in antiretroviral - naive patients and 133 cells / mm3 ( 4 % ) in antiretroviral - experienced patients who received REYATAZ oral powder with ritonavir .

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA - approved patient labeling ( PATIENT INFORMATION and INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE ) .
REYATAZ is not a cure for HIV infection and patients may continue to experience illnesses associated with HIV infection , including opportunistic infections .
Tell patients that sustained decreases in plasma HIV RNA have been associated with a reduced risk of progression to AIDS and death .
Advise patients to remain under the care of a healthcare provider while using REYATAZ .
HIV Transmission Advise patients to avoid doing things that can spread HIV infection to others .
• Do not share or reuse needles or other injection equipment .
• Do not share personal items that can have blood or body fluids on them , like toothbrushes and razor blades .
• Do not have any kind of sex without protection .
Always practice safer sex by using a latex or polyurethane condom to lower the chance of sexual contact with semen , vaginal secretions , or blood .
• Do not breastfeed .
REYATAZ can be passed to your baby in your breast milk and it is not known whether it could harm your baby .
Also , mothers with HIV should not breastfeed because HIV can be passed to the baby in breast milk .
Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities Inform patients that atazanavir may produce changes in the electrocardiogram ( eg , PR prolongation ) .
Tell patients to consult their healthcare provider if they are experiencing symptoms such as dizziness or lightheadedness [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Severe Skin Reaction Inform patients that there have been reports of severe skin reactions ( eg , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , erythema multiforme , and toxic skin eruptions ) with REYATAZ use .
Advise patients that if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop , they must discontinue REYATAZ and seek medical evaluation immediately [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 2 ) and ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Hyperbilirubinemia Inform patients that asymptomatic elevations in indirect bilirubin have occurred in patients receiving REYATAZ .
This may be accompanied by yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes and alternative antiretroviral therapy may be considered if the patient has cosmetic concerns [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
Patients with Phenylketonuria Advise caregivers of patients with phenylketonuria that REYATAZ oral powder contains phenylalanine [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Nephrolithiasis and Cholelithiasis Inform patients that kidney stones and / or gallstones have been reported with REYATAZ use .
Some patients with kidney stones and / or gallstones required hospitalization for additional management and some had complications .
Discontinuation of REYATAZ may be necessary as part of the medical management of these adverse events [ see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
Drug Interactions REYATAZ may lead to significant interaction with some drugs ; therefore , advise patients to report the use of any other prescription , nonprescription medication , or herbal products , particularly St . John ’ s wort , to their healthcare provider prior to use [ see CONTRAINDICATIONS ( 4 ) , WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ( 5 . 7 ) ] .

Dosing Instructions Advise patients to take REYATAZ with food every day and take other concomitant antiretroviral therapy as prescribed .
REYATAZ must always be used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs .
Advise patients that they should not alter the dose or discontinue therapy without consulting with their healthcare provider .
Tell patients if a dose of REYATAZ is missed , they should take the dose as soon as possible and then return to their normal schedule ; however , if a dose is skipped the patient should not double the next dose .
Pregnancy Inform pregnant patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to REYATAZ during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry [ see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
PATIENT PACKAGE INSERT PATIENT INFORMATION REYATAZ ® ( RAY - ah - taz ) ( atazanavir ) capsules REYATAZ ® ( RAY - ah - taz ) ( atazanavir ) oral powder Important : Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist about medicines that should not be taken with REYATAZ .
For more information , see “ Who should not take REYATAZ ? ”
and “ What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking REYATAZ ? ”
What is REYATAZ ?
REYATAZ is a prescription HIV - 1 ( Human Immunodeficiency Virus - type 1 ) medicine that is used with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV - 1 infection in adults and children 3 months of age and older and who weigh at least 11 pounds ( 5 kg ) .
HIV - 1 is the virus that causes AIDS ( Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ) .
REYATAZ should not be used in children younger than 3 months of age .
When used with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV - 1 infection , REYATAZ may help : • reduce the amount of HIV - 1 in your blood .
This is called “ viral load ” .
• increase the number of CD4 + ( T ) cells in your blood that help fight off other infections .
Reducing the amount of HIV - 1 and increasing the CD4 + ( T ) cells in your blood may help improve your immune system .
This may reduce your risk of death or getting infections that can happen when your immune system is weak ( opportunistic infections ) .
REYATAZ does not cure HIV - 1 infection or AIDS .
You must keep taking HIV - 1 medicines to control HIV - 1 infection and decrease HIV - related illnesses .
Avoid doing things that can spread HIV - 1 infection to others : • Do not share or reuse needles or other injection equipment .
