[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] COLLECTION AND SAMPLING PROCEDURE INSTRUCTION FOR USE Before Donation 1 ) Peel open the transparent overwrap ( D ) using the corner flap .
2 ) Support blood bag system as far as possible below donor arm , ideally on an automated blood mixer .
Note : it is recommended that the primary bag on the mixer lies with the tubing on the lower side of the mixer holding plate .
3 ) Apply tourniquet or pressure cuff ( inflate to approximately 60 mm Hg ) .
4 ) Prepare venipuncture site as per your SOP .
5 ) Ensure that the donor line is not twisted or tangled .
Venipuncture 1 ) Open the needle cap ( E1 ) using the following procedure : a ) Twist the needle cap , thus breaking the seal .
b ) Lift the cap off of the needle ( E2 ) in a straight line taking special care not to touch the needle in the process ( F ) .
Keep hands behind the needle at all times during set use and disposal .
2 ) Perform the venipuncture .
3 ) After the needle has been inserted , introduce the Secuvam onto the hub of the needle .
4 ) Tape the Secuvam onto the donor ' s arm .
Note : if the Secuvam causes discomfort to the donor or decreases the blood flow because of the angle of the needle , leave the Secuvam on the tubing , behind the needle hub ( G ) during collection .
Secure the needle into the Secuvam at the end of the donation ( H ) .
After Venipuncture 1 ) Ensure that the clamp between the Bactivam pouch and the donation line is open .
2 ) Ensure that the Bactivam pouch is held below the level of the venipuncture site , and is supported at all times .
3 ) Allow blood to run into the Bactivam pouch until the pouch fills ( approximately 30 ml ) ( I ) .
4 ) Close the red clamp ( I1 ) on the transfer line to the Bactivam pouch , by holding the clamp in one hand and squeezing the two edges together , until it locks ( a click may be heard ) .
Note : the red clamp cannot be opened after it has snapped shut .
5 ) Break the break - away cannula ( I2 ) on the donor line by holding the cannula in one hand and the plastic Y - junction in the other and snapping the cannula both left and right to ensure a clean break .
Allow the donation procedure to continue , ensuring that the blood bag is mixed immediately when blood flows into the primary bag .
Note : This step may be done prior to venipuncture if the Blue Roberts clamp ( I3 ) on the donor line is closed prior to breaking the break - away cannula .
6 ) If using an automated mixer , open the mixer clamp and start the mixer at this point .
Note : it is recommended that the primary bag on the mixer lies with the tubing on the lower side of the mixer holding plate .
7 ) After approximately 50 ml of blood enters the primary bag , mix thoroughly ( when possible ) .
Note : Collect the quantity of blood stated on the blood bag label .
Sampling Procedure Note : this is done during the donation .
Avoid air in the collection of sample tubes from the diversion pouch to ensure adequate sample volume and avoid hemolysis .
1 ) Hold the Bactivam pouch with the Vacuvam below it ( J ) , to ensure good blood flow from the pouch to the sampling device , and no introduction of air into the sampling tubes .
2 ) Remove the cap of the Vacuvam sampling device , and retain for later use ( when possible ) .
3 ) Introduce a vacuum sampling tube by holding the barrel of the Vacuvam and directing the sample tube cap directly onto the needle inside the device ( J1 ) .
4 ) Blood is drawn automatically into the sampling tube , stopping at the appropriate volume .
5 ) When the sample tube stops filling , withdraw the tube , ensuring that the tube is pulled out of the barrel in a straight line .
6 ) Repeat the sampling procedure steps ( 3 to 5 ) with all remaining sampling tubes .
7 ) When all samples have been taken , replace the Vacuvam cap to prevent accidental access to the interior needle ( when possible ) .
8 ) Mix the blood in the primary bag regularly ( approximately every 100 ml or every minute ) .
After Donation 1 ) Once the required volume of blood has been collected , close the red clamp on the donor line ( J2 ) , at least 12 inches above the primary bag .
Note : if necessary , place a Hemostat on the colletion line just below the Secuvam .
2 ) Release the pressure cuff or tourniquet , and immediately mix the whole blood in the primary bag .
Note : if the needle was taped to the arm , and not the Secuvam , remove the tape from the needle before pulling the needle into the Secuvam ( disregard step 3 ) .
3 ) Remove the tape holding the Secuvam in place .
4 ) Remove the needle by gently pulling the needle into the barrel of the Secuvam while supporting the Secuvam with one hand ( a click may be heard ) .
Note : if necessary , step 4 may be done before step 3 .
5 ) Remove and discard the cap ( if relevant ) from the barrel of the Vacuvam , into an appropriate container .
6 ) Insert the Secuvam needle protector into the barrel of the Vacuvam sampling device .
7 ) After removing the blood from the mixer / trip scale , mix the blood unit thoroughly .
8 ) If the donor line is to be used for quality control , strip the line as per procedure ( at least 3 times ) , heat - seal ( place clips ) and cut ( between the clips ) , leaving sufficient line for testing purposes .
Note : if it is necessary to strip the donor line , it is recommended to strip within 4 minutes of the end of the donation , in order to avoid introducing clots into the blood bag .
9 ) Ideally , heat - seal the donor line as close as possible to the pack ( ~ 1 inch ) .
Alternatively , place clips close to the blood pack and cut between the clips .
Mix thoroughly during and immediately after the procedure .
Note : this is an in - line filter system ; there is no need to keep the donor line for cross - matching segments .
10 ) Remove and discard the donor line ( K ) with the two red clamps , Blue Roberts clamp , Bactivam , Vacuvam and Secuvam as per SOP .
Note : the completely protected needle after securing the Secuvam inside the rigid Vacuvam sleeve can be disposed of in general biowaste vs . a sharps container .

Do not apply pressure , either mechanical or human , to increase the flow rate of the filter .
• Units with decreased or extended filtration times may not be adequately leukoreduced , and should be evaluated for residual leukocytes and red blood cell recovery before release .
Consult training materials for more information on expected length of filtration times and the applicable hold periods in clinical study data .
• Failure to achieve and maintain a closed system throughout processing results in a product that must be stored at 1 to 6 C and transfused within 24 hours .
• The AS - 1 additive solution must be added to the red blood cells without delay after the separation of the plasma .
Whole blood in CPD alone may be stored at 1 to 6 C for up to 21 days .
• The filter has been designed and validated to meet the criteria of a leukocytes reduction filter for Red Blood Cells .
The filter ' s performance must be validated using your facility ' s standard operating procedure ( SOP ) on component preparation and handling .
Any filtration that fails to meet the filtration specifications established by the facility ' s validation should be evaluated for residual leukocytes and red blood cell ( RBC ) recovery after filtration .
Note that unusual attributes such as sickle cell trait , cold agglutinins , blood clotting and gel formation , and poor mixing during collection and processing of components can contribute to the failure of a filtration to meet filtration specifications .
Failure to adequately mix RBC with Additive Solution thoroughly prior to filtration can result in blocked filters .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] BLOOD COMPONENTS SEPARATION 1 ) Obtain collected Whole Blood from 1 - 6 C storage container .
2 ) Mix the Whole Blood thoroughly .
3 ) Pack the collection system into a centrifuge as per your facility ' s standard operating procedure ( SOP ) .
4 ) Centrifuge the blood , satellite bag , and additive solution bag together under conditions designed to produce a separation of plasma and red blood cells .
5 ) Place the centrifuged blood carefully into an extractor , and gently release the pressure plate .
6 ) Break the break - away cannula ( M ) on the tubing leading to the plasma bag by bending the cannula with a side - to - side motion .
7 ) Express Plasma into appropriate container .
8 ) If preparing Cryoprecipitate AHF ( Anti - Hemophilic Factor ) from this Plasma , place a temporary clamp between the ' Y ' connector ( N ) and the bag for the final storage of plasma otherwise , add a permanent clamp .
9 ) If required , express the air from the plasma back into the RBC bag .
10 ) Heat seal and disconnect the Plasma bag .
( If Cryoprecipitate is manufactured heat seal the tubing 1 inch before the Y connector ) .
