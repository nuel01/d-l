The dose of the oral solution should be administered using the calibrated cup ( supplied ) or oral dosing syringe .
KALETRA 100 / 25 mg tablets should be considered only in children who have reliably demonstrated the ability to swallow the intact tablet .
KALETRA oral solution is not recommended in neonates before a postmenstrual age ( first day of the mother ’ s last menstrual period to birth plus the time elapsed after birth ) of 42 weeks and a postnatal age of at least 14 days has been attained [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
KALETRA oral solution contains approximately 42 % ( v / v ) ethanol and approximately 15 % ( w / v ) propylene glycol .
Total amounts of ethanol and propylene glycol from all medicines that are to be given to pediatric patients 14 days to 6 months of age should be taken into account in order to avoid toxicity from these excipients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
Pediatric Dosage Calculations Calculate the appropriate dose of KALETRA for each individual pediatric patient based on body weight ( kg ) or body surface area ( BSA ) to avoid underdosing or exceeding the recommended adult dose .
Body surface area ( BSA ) can be calculated as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The KALETRA dose can be calculated based on weight or BSA : Based on Weight : Patient Weight ( kg ) × Prescribed lopinavir dose ( mg / kg ) = Administered lopinavir dose ( mg ) Based on BSA : Patient BSA ( m 2 ) × Prescribed lopinavir dose ( mg / m 2 ) = Administered lopinavir dose ( mg ) If KALETRA oral solution is used , the volume ( mL ) of KALETRA solution can be determined as follows : Volume of KALETRA solution ( mL ) = Administered lopinavir dose ( mg ) ÷ 80 ( mg / mL ) Oral Solution Dosage Recommendation in Pediatric Patients 14 Days to Less Than 18 Years : Table 4 summarizes the recommended daily dosing regimen for pediatric patients 14 days to less than 18 years of age using the oral solution .
KALETRA administered in combination with efavirenz , nevirapine , or nelfinavir in patients younger than 6 months of age is not recommended .
Total dose of KALETRA oral solution in pediatric patients should not exceed the recommended adult daily dose of 400 / 100 mg ( 5 mL ) twice daily .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 2 . 5 Dosage Recommendations in Pregnancy Administer 400 / 100 mg of KALETRA twice daily in pregnant patients with no documented lopinavir - associated resistance substitutions .
• Once daily KALETRA dosing is not recommended in pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
• There are insufficient data to recommend dosing in pregnant women with any documented lopinavir - associated resistance substitutions .
• No dosage adjustment of KALETRA is required for patients during the postpartum period .
• Avoid use of KALETRA oral solution in pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
• KALETRA is contraindicated in patients with previously demonstrated clinically significant hypersensitivity ( e . g . , toxic epidermal necrolysis , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , erythema multiforme , urticaria , angioedema ) to any of its ingredients , including ritonavir .
• KALETRA is contraindicated with drugs that are highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and / or life - threatening reactions [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
• Alpha 1 - Adrenoreceptor Antagonist : alfuzosin • Antianginal : ranolazine • Antiarrhythmic : dronedarone • Anti - gout : colchicine • Antipsychotics : lurasidone , pimozide • Ergot Derivatives : dihydroergotamine , ergotamine , methylergonovine • GI Motility Agent : cisapride • Hepatitis C direct acting antiviral : elbasvir / grazoprevir • HMG - CoA Reductase Inhibitors : lovastatin , simvastatin • Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein ( MTTP ) Inhibitor : lomitapideMicrosomal triglyceride transfer protein ( MTTP ) Inhibitor : lomitapide • PDE5 Inhibitor : sildenafil ( Revatio ® ) when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension • Sedative / Hypnotics : triazolam , orally administered midazolam • KALETRA is contraindicated with drugs that are potent CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced lopinavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance and cross - resistance [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
• Anticancer Agents : apalutamide • Antimycobacterial : rifampin • Herbal Products : St . John ' s Wort ( hypericum perforatum ) • Hypersensitivity to KALETRA ( e . g . , toxic epidermal necrolysis , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , erythema multiforme , urticaria , angioedema ) or any of its ingredients , including ritonavir .
( 4 ) • Co - administration with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma levels may result in serious and / or life - threatening events .
( 4 ) • Co - administration with potent CYP3A inducers where significantly reduced lopinavir plasma concentrations may be associated with the potential for loss of virologic response and possible resistance and cross resistance .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS The following have been observed in patients receiving KALETRA : • The concomitant use of KALETRA and certain other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions .
Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions .
( 5 . 1 , 7 . 3 ) • Toxicity in preterm neonates : KALETRA oral solution should not be used in preterm neonates in the immediate postnatal period because of possible toxicities .
A safe and effective dose of KALETRA oral solution in this patient population has not been established .
( 2 . 4 , 5 . 2 ) • Pancreatitis : Fatalities have occurred ; suspend therapy as clinically appropriate .
( 5 . 3 ) • Hepatotoxicity : Fatalities have occurred .
Monitor liver function before and during therapy , especially in patients with underlying hepatic disease , including hepatitis B and hepatitis C , or marked transaminase elevations .
( 5 . 4 , 8 . 6 ) • QT interval prolongation and isolated cases of torsade de pointes have been reported although causality could not be established .
Avoid use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome , those with hypokalemia , and with other drugs that prolong the QT interval .
( 5 . 1 , 5 . 5 , 12 . 3 ) • PR interval prolongation may occur in some patients .
Cases of second and third degree heart block have been reported .
Use with caution in patients with pre - existing conduction system disease , ischemic heart disease , cardiomyopathy , underlying structural heart disease or when administering with other drugs that may prolong the PR interval .
( 5 . 1 , 5 . 6 , 12 . 3 ) • Patients may develop new onset or exacerbations of diabetes mellitus , hyperglycemia ( 5 . 7 ) , immune reconstitution syndrome .
( 5 . 8 ) , redistribution / accumulation of body fat .
( 5 . 10 ) • Total cholesterol and triglycerides elevations .
Monitor prior to therapy and periodically thereafter .
( 5 . 9 ) • Hemophilia : Spontaneous bleeding may occur , and additional factor VIII may be required .
( 5 . 11 ) 5 . 1 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions Initiation of KALETRA , a CYP3A inhibitor , in patients receiving medications metabolized by CYP3A or initiation of medications metabolized by CYP3A in patients already receiving KALETRA , may increase plasma concentrations of medications metabolized by CYP3A .
Initiation of medications that inhibit or induce CYP3A may increase or decrease concentrations of KALETRA , respectively .
These interactions may lead to : • Clinically significant adverse reactions , potentially leading to severe , life - threatening , or fatal events from greater exposures of concomitant medications .
• Clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of KALETRA .
• Loss of therapeutic effect of KALETRA and possible development of resistance .
See Table 12 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions , including dosing recommendations [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during KALETRA therapy ; review concomitant medications during KALETRA therapy , and monitor for the adverse reactions associated with the concomitant medications [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
5 . 2 Toxicity in Preterm Neonates KALETRA oral solution contains the excipients ethanol , approximately 42 % ( v / v ) and propylene glycol , approximately 15 % ( w / v ) .
When administered concomitantly with propylene glycol , ethanol competitively inhibits the metabolism of propylene glycol , which may lead to elevated concentrations .
Preterm neonates may be at increased risk of propylene glycol - associated adverse events due to diminished ability to metabolize propylene glycol , thereby leading to accumulation and potential adverse events .
Postmarketing life - threatening cases of cardiac toxicity ( including complete AV block , bradycardia , and cardiomyopathy ) , lactic acidosis , acute renal failure , CNS depression and respiratory complications leading to death have been reported , predominantly in preterm neonates receiving KALETRA oral solution .
KALETRA oral solution should not be used in preterm neonates in the immediate postnatal period because of possible toxicities .
A safe and effective dose of KALETRA oral solution in this patient population has not been established .
However , if the benefit of using KALETRA oral solution to treat HIV infection in infants immediately after birth outweighs the potential risks , infants should be monitored closely for increases in serum osmolality and serum creatinine , and for toxicity related to KALETRA oral solution including : hyperosmolality , with or without lactic acidosis , renal toxicity , CNS depression ( including stupor , coma , and apnea ) , seizures , hypotonia , cardiac arrhythmias and ECG changes , and hemolysis .
Total amounts of ethanol and propylene glycol from all medicines that are to be given to infants should be taken into account in order to avoid toxicity from these excipients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Overdosage ( 10 ) ] .
5 . 3 Pancreatitis Pancreatitis has been observed in patients receiving KALETRA therapy , including those who developed marked triglyceride elevations .
In some cases , fatalities have been observed .
Although a causal relationship to KALETRA has not been established , marked triglyceride elevations are a risk factor for development of pancreatitis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] .
Patients with advanced HIV - 1 disease may be at increased risk of elevated triglycerides and pancreatitis , and patients with a history of pancreatitis may be at increased risk for recurrence during KALETRA therapy .
Pancreatitis should be considered if clinical symptoms ( nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain ) or abnormalities in laboratory values ( such as increased serum lipase or amylase values ) suggestive of pancreatitis occur .
Patients who exhibit these signs or symptoms should be evaluated and KALETRA and / or other antiretroviral therapy should be suspended as clinically appropriate .
5 . 4 Hepatotoxicity Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C or marked elevations in transaminase prior to treatment may be at increased risk for developing or worsening of transaminase elevations or hepatic decompensation with use of KALETRA .
There have been postmarketing reports of hepatic dysfunction , including some fatalities .
These have generally occurred in patients with advanced HIV - 1 disease taking multiple concomitant medications in the setting of underlying chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis .
A causal relationship with KALETRA therapy has not been established .
Elevated transaminases with or without elevated bilirubin levels have been reported in HIV - 1 mono - infected and uninfected patients as early as 7 days after the initiation of KALETRA in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents .
In some cases , the hepatic dysfunction was serious ; however , a definitive causal relationship with KALETRA therapy has not been established .
Appropriate laboratory testing should be conducted prior to initiating therapy with KALETRA and patients should be monitored closely during treatment .
Increased AST / ALT monitoring should be considered in the patients with underlying chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis , especially during the first several months of KALETRA treatment [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
5 . 5 QT Interval Prolongation Postmarketing cases of QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes have been reported although causality of KALETRA could not be established .
Avoid use in patients with congenital long QT syndrome , those with hypokalemia , and with other drugs that prolong the QT interval [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 6 PR Interval Prolongation Lopinavir / ritonavir prolongs the PR interval in some patients .
Cases of second or third degree atrioventricular block have been reported .
KALETRA should be used with caution in patients with underlying structural heart disease , pre - existing conduction system abnormalities , ischemic heart disease or cardiomyopathies , as these patients may be at increased risk for developing cardiac conduction abnormalities .
The impact on the PR interval of co - administration of KALETRA with other drugs that prolong the PR interval ( including calcium channel blockers , beta - adrenergic blockers , digoxin and atazanavir ) has not been evaluated .
As a result , co - administration of KALETRA with these drugs should be undertaken with caution , particularly with those drugs metabolized by CYP3A .
Clinical monitoring is recommended [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 7 Diabetes Mellitus / Hyperglycemia New onset diabetes mellitus , exacerbation of pre - existing diabetes mellitus , and hyperglycemia have been reported during post - marketing surveillance in HIV - 1 infected patients receiving protease inhibitor therapy .
Some patients required either initiation or dose adjustments of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents for treatment of these events .
In some cases , diabetic ketoacidosis has occurred .
In those patients who discontinued protease inhibitor therapy , hyperglycemia persisted in some cases .
Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice , estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established .
Consider monitoring for hyperglycemia , new onset diabetes mellitus or an exacerbation of diabetes mellitus in patients treated with KALETRA .
5 . 8 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy , including KALETRA .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [ PCP ] , or tuberculosis ) which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
Autoimmune disorders ( such as Graves ’ disease , polymyositis , and Guillain - Barré syndrome ) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution , however , the time to onset is more variable , and can occur many months after initiation of treatment .
5 . 9 Lipid Elevations Treatment with KALETRA has resulted in large increases in the concentration of total cholesterol and triglycerides [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Triglyceride and cholesterol testing should be performed prior to initiating KALETRA therapy and at periodic intervals during therapy .
Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate , taking into account any potential drug - drug interactions with KALETRA and HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 10 Fat Redistribution Redistribution / accumulation of body fat including central obesity , dorsocervical fat enlargement ( buffalo hump ) , peripheral wasting , facial wasting , breast enlargement , and " cushingoid appearance " have been observed in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy .
The mechanism and long - term consequences of these events are currently unknown .
A causal relationship has not been established .
5 . 11 Patients with Hemophilia Increased bleeding , including spontaneous skin hematomas and hemarthrosis have been reported in patients with hemophilia type A and B treated with protease inhibitors .
In some patients additional factor VIII was given .
In more than half of the reported cases , treatment with protease inhibitors was continued or reintroduced .
A causal relationship between protease inhibitor therapy and these events has not been established .
5 . 12 Resistance / Cross - resistance Because the potential for HIV cross - resistance among protease inhibitors has not been fully explored in KALETRA - treated patients , it is unknown what effect therapy with KALETRA will have on the activity of subsequently administered protease inhibitors [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling .
• QT Interval Prolongation , PR Interval Prolongation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 , 5 . 6 ) ] • Drug Interactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Pancreatitis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Hepatotoxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] Commonly reported adverse reactions to KALETRA included diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia .

Adverse Reactions in Adults The safety of KALETRA has been investigated in about 2 , 600 patients in Phase II - IV clinical trials , of which about 700 have received a dose of 800 / 200 mg ( 6 capsules or 4 tablets ) once daily .
Along with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) , in some studies , KALETRA was used in combination with efavirenz or nevirapine .
In clinical studies the incidence of diarrhea in patients treated with either KALETRA capsules or tablets was greater in those patients treated once daily than in those patients treated twice daily .
Any grade of diarrhea was reported by at least half of patients taking once daily Kaletra capsules or tablets .
At the time of treatment discontinuation , 4 . 2 - 6 . 3 % of patients taking once daily Kaletra and 1 . 8 - 3 . 7 % of those taking twice daily Kaletra reported ongoing diarrhea .
Commonly reported adverse reactions to KALETRA included diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia .
Diarrhea , nausea and vomiting may occur at the beginning of the treatment while hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia may occur later .
The following have been identified as adverse reactions of moderate or severe intensity ( Table 8 ) : Table 8 .

The potential for drug - drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy .
( 4 , 5 . 1 , 7 , 12 . 3 ) 7 . 1 Potential for KALETRA to Affect Other Drugs Lopinavir / ritonavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A and may increase plasma concentrations of agents that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A .
Agents that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A and have high first pass metabolism appear to be the most susceptible to large increases in AUC ( > 3 - fold ) when co - administered with KALETRA .
Thus , co - administration of KALETRA with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and / or life - threatening events is contraindicated .
Co - administration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring as shown in Table 12 .
Additionally , KALETRA induces glucuronidation .
Published data suggest that lopinavir is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 .
These examples are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may interact with lopinavir / ritonavir .
The healthcare provider should consult appropriate references for comprehensive information .
7 . 2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Lopinavir Lopinavir / ritonavir is a CYP3A substrate ; therefore , drugs that induce CYP3A may decrease lopinavir plasma concentrations and reduce KALETRA ’ s therapeutic effect .
Although not observed in the KALETRA / ketoconazole drug interaction study , co - administration of KALETRA and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A may increase lopinavir plasma concentrations .
7 . 3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions Table 12 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions .
Alteration in dose or regimen may be recommended based on drug interaction studies or predicted interaction [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] for magnitude of interaction .

Risk Summary Available data from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry show no difference in the risk of overall major birth defects compared to the background rate for major birth defects of 2 . 7 % in the U . S . reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program ( MACDP ) ( see Data ) .
The estimated background rate of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies in the U . S . general population is 15 - 20 % .
The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
Methodological limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group .
The MACDP population is not disease - specific , evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area , and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at < 20 weeks gestation ( see Data ) .
No treatment - related malformations were observed when lopinavir in combination with ritonavir was administered to pregnant rats or rabbits ; however embryonic and fetal developmental toxicities occurred in rats administered maternally toxic doses .
Clinical Considerations Dose Adjustments During Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period Administer 400 / 100 mg of KALETRA twice daily in pregnant patients with no documented lopinavir - associated resistance substitutions [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
There are insufficient data to recommend KALETRA dosing for pregnant patients with any documented lopinavir - associated resistance substitutions .
No dose adjustment of KALETRA is required for patients during the postpartum period .
Once daily KALETRA dosing is not recommended in pregnancy .
Avoid use of KALETRA oral solution during pregnancy due to the ethanol content .
KALETRA oral solution contains the excipients ethanol , approximately 42 % ( v / v and propylene glycol , approximately 15 % .
Data Human Data KALETRA was evaluated in 12 HIV - infected pregnant women in an open - label pharmacokinetic trial [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No new trends in the safety profile were identified in pregnant women dosed with KALETRA compared to the safety described in non - pregnant adults , based on the review of these limited data .
Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry Data : Based on prospective reports from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry ( APR ) of over 3 , 000 exposures to lopinavir containing regimens ( including over 1 , 000 exposed in the first trimester ) , there was no difference between lopinavir and overall birth defects compared with the background birth defect rate of 2 . 7 % in the U . S . reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program .
The prevalence of birth defects in live births was 2 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 4 % - 3 . 0 % ) following first - trimester exposure to lopinavir - containing regimens and 3 . 0 % ( 95 % CI : 2 . 4 % - 3 . 8 % ) following second and third trimester exposure to lopinavir - containing regimens .
Based on prospective reports from the APR of over 5 , 000 exposures to ritonavir containing regimens ( including over 2 , 000 exposures in the first trimester ) there was no difference between ritonavir and overall birth defects compared with the U . S . background rate ( MACDP ) .
The prevalence of birth defects in live births was 2 . 2 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 7 % - 2 . 8 % ) following first - trimester exposure to ritonavir - containing regimens and 2 . 9 % ( 95 % CI : 2 . 4 % - 3 . 6 % ) following second and third trimester exposure to ritonavir - containing regimens .
For both lopinavir and ritonavir , sufficient numbers of first trimester exposures have been monitored to detect at least a 1 . 5 fold increase in risk of overall birth defects and a 2 fold increase in risk of birth defects in the cardiovascular and genitourinary systems .
Animal Data Embryonic and fetal developmental toxicities ( early resorption , decreased fetal viability , decreased fetal body weight , increased incidence of skeletal variations and skeletal ossification delays ) occurred in rats administered lopinavir in combination with ritonavir ( on gestation days 6 - 17 ) at a maternally toxic dosage .
Based on AUC measurements , the drug exposures in rats at the toxic doses were approximately 0 . 7 times ( for lopinavir ) and 1 . 8 times ( for ritonavir ) the exposures in humans at the recommended therapeutic dose ( 400 / 100 mg twice daily ) .
In a pre - and post - natal study in rats , a developmental toxicity ( a decrease in survival in pups between birth and postnatal Day 21 ) occurred .
No embryonic and fetal developmental toxicities were observed in rabbits administered lopinavir in combination with ritonavir ( on gestation days 6 - 18 ) at a maternally toxic dosage .
Based on AUC measurements , the drug exposures in rabbits at the toxic doses were approximately 0 . 6 times ( for lopinavir ) and similar to ( for ritonavir ) the exposures in humans at the recommended therapeutic dose ( 400 / 100 mg twice daily ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV - 1 infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV - 1 .
Because of the potential for : 1 ) HIV transmission ( in HIV - negative infants ) , 2 ) developing viral resistance ( in HIV - positive infants ) , and 3 ) adverse reactions in the breastfed infant , instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving KALETRA .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Use of KALETRA may reduce the efficacy of combined hormonal contraceptives .
Advise patients using combined hormonal contraceptives to use an effective alternative contraceptive method or an additional barrier method of contraception [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety , efficacy , and pharmacokinetic profiles of KALETRA in pediatric patients below the age of 14 days have not been established .
KALETRA should not be administered once daily in pediatric patients .
An open - label , multi - center , dose - finding trial was performed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile , tolerability , safety and efficacy of KALETRA oral solution containing lopinavir 80 mg / mL and ritonavir 20 mg / mL at a dose of 300 / 75 mg / m 2 twice daily plus two NRTIs in HIV - infected infants ≥ 14 days and < 6 months of age .
Results revealed that infants younger than 6 months of age generally had lower lopinavir AUC 12 than older children ( 6 months to 12 years of age ) , however , despite the lower lopinavir drug exposure observed , antiviral activity was demonstrated as reflected in the proportion of subjects who achieved HIV - 1 RNA < 400 copies / mL at Week 24 [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients > 6 months of age was demonstrated in a clinical trial in 100 patients .
The clinical trial was an open - label , multicenter trial evaluating the pharmacokinetic profile , tolerability , safety , and efficacy of KALETRA oral solution containing lopinavir 80 mg / mL and ritonavir 20 mg / mL in 100 antiretroviral naïve and experienced pediatric patients ages 6 months to 12 years .
Dose selection for patients 6 months to 12 years of age was based on the following results .
The 230 / 57 . 5 mg / m 2 oral solution twice daily regimen without nevirapine and the 300 / 75 mg / m 2 oral solution twice daily regimen with nevirapine provided lopinavir plasma concentrations similar to those obtained in adult patients receiving the 400 / 100 mg twice daily regimen ( without nevirapine ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
A prospective multicenter , open - label trial evaluated the pharmacokinetic profile , tolerability , safety and efficacy of high - dose KALETRA with or without concurrent NNRTI therapy ( Group 1 : 400 / 100 mg / m 2 twice daily + ≥ 2 NRTIs ; Group 2 : 480 / 120 mg / m 2 twice daily + ≥ 1 NRTI + 1 NNRTI ) in 26 children and adolescents ≥ 2 years to < 18 years of age who had failed prior therapy .
Patients also had saquinavir mesylate added to their regimen .
This strategy was intended to assess whether higher than approved doses of KALETRA could overcome protease inhibitor cross - resistance .
High doses of KALETRA exhibited a safety profile similar to those observed in previous trials ; changes in HIV - 1 RNA were less than anticipated ; three patients had HIV - 1 RNA < 400 copies / mL at Week 48 .
CD4 + cell count increases were noted in the eight patients who remained on treatment for 48 weeks [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
A prospective multicenter , randomized , open - label study evaluated the efficacy and safety of twice - daily versus once - daily dosing of KALETRA tablets dosed by weight as part of combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) in virologically suppressed HIV - 1 infected children ( n = 173 ) .
Children were eligible when they were aged < 18 years , ≥ 15 kg in weight , receiving cART that included KALETRA , HIV - 1 ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) < 50 copies / mL for at least 24 weeks and able to swallow tablets .
At week 24 , efficacy ( defined as the proportion of subjects with plasma HIV - 1 RNA less than 50 copies per mL ) was significantly higher in subjects receiving twice daily dosing compared to subjects receiving once daily dosing .
The safety profile was similar between the two treatment arms although there was a greater incidence of diarrhea in the once daily treated subjects .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of KALETRA did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , appropriate caution should be exercised in the administration and monitoring of KALETRA in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment KALETRA is principally metabolized by the liver ; therefore , caution should be exercised when administering this drug to patients with hepatic impairment , because lopinavir concentrations may be increased [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdoses with KALETRA oral solution have been reported .
One of these reports described fatal cardiogenic shock in a 2 . 1 kg infant who received a single dose of 6 . 5 mL of KALETRA oral solution ( 520 mg lopinavir , approximately 10 - fold above the recommended lopinavir dose ) nine days prior .
The following events have been reported in association with unintended overdoses in preterm neonates : complete AV block , cardiomyopathy , lactic acidosis , and acute renal failure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Healthcare professionals should be aware that KALETRA oral solution is highly concentrated and therefore , should pay special attention to accurate calculation of the dose of KALETRA , transcription of the medication order , dispensing information and dosing instructions to minimize the risk for medication errors and overdose .
This is especially important for infants and young children .
KALETRA oral solution contains approximately 42 % ( v / v ) ethanol and approximately 15 % ( w / v ) propylene glycol .
Ingestion of the product over the recommended dose by an infant or a young child could result in significant toxicity and could potentially be lethal .
Human experience of acute overdosage with KALETRA is limited .
Treatment of overdose with KALETRA should consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient .
There is no specific antidote for overdose with KALETRA .
If indicated , elimination of unabsorbed drug should be achieved by gastric lavage .
Administration of activated charcoal may also be used to aid in removal of unabsorbed drug .
Since lopinavir is highly protein bound , dialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in significant removal of the drug .
However , dialysis can remove both ethanol and propylene glycol in the case of overdose with KALETRA oral solution .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action KALETRA is a fixed - dose combination of HIV - 1 antiviral drugs lopinavir [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] and ritonavir .
As co - formulated in KALETRA , ritonavir inhibits the CYP3A - mediated metabolism of lopinavir , thereby providing increased plasma levels of lopinavir .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of KALETRA on QTcF interval was evaluated in a placebo and active ( moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily ) controlled crossover study in 39 healthy adults .
The maximum mean time - matched ( 95 % upper confidence bound ) differences in QTcF interval from placebo after baseline - correction were 5 . 3 ( 8 . 1 ) and 15 . 2 ( 18 . 0 ) mseconds ( msec ) for 400 / 100 mg twice daily and supratherapeutic 800 / 200 mg twice daily KALETRA , respectively .
KALETRA 800 / 200 mg twice daily resulted in a Day 3 mean C max approximately 2 - fold higher than the mean C max observed with the approved once daily and twice daily KALETRA doses at steady state .
The maximum mean ( 95 % upper confidence bound ) difference from placebo in the PR interval after baseline - correction were 24 . 9 ( 21 . 5 , 28 . 3 ) and 31 . 9 ( 28 . 5 , 35 . 3 ) msec for 400 / 100 mg twice daily and supratherapeutic 800 / 200 mg twice daily KALETRA , respectively [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 , 5 . 6 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic properties of lopinavir are summarized in Table 13 .
The steady - state pharmacokinetic parameters of lopinavir are summarized in Table 14 .
Under fed conditions , lopinavir concentrations were similar following administration of KALETRA tablets to capsules with less pharmacokinetic variability .
Under fed conditions ( 500 kcal , 25 % from fat ) , lopinavir concentrations were similar following administration of KALETRA capsules and oral solution .

Yet this decrease is not considered clinically relevant in patients with no documented KALETRA - associated resistance substitutions receiving 400 mg / 100 mg twice daily [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Renal Impairment Lopinavir pharmacokinetics have not been studied in patients with renal impairment ; however , since the renal clearance of lopinavir is negligible , a decrease in total body clearance is not expected in patients with renal impairment .
Hepatic Impairment Multiple dosing of KALETRA 400 / 100 mg twice daily to HIV - 1 and HCV co - infected patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment ( n = 12 ) resulted in a 30 % increase in lopinavir AUC and 20 % increase in C max compared to HIV - 1 infected subjects with normal hepatic function ( n = 12 ) .
Additionally , the plasma protein binding of lopinavir was statistically significantly lower in both mild and moderate hepatic impairment compared to controls ( 99 . 09 vs . 99 . 31 % , respectively ) .
KALETRA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Drug Interactions KALETRA is an inhibitor of the P450 isoform CYP3A in vitro .
KALETRA does not inhibit CYP2D6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2E1 , CYP2B6 or CYP1A2 at clinically relevant concentrations .
KALETRA has been shown in vivo to induce its own metabolism and to increase the biotransformation of some drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes and by glucuronidation .
The effects of co - administration of KALETRA on the AUC , C max and C min are summarized in Table 16 ( effect of other drugs on lopinavir ) and Table 17 ( effect of KALETRA on other drugs ) .

12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Lopinavir , an inhibitor of the HIV - 1 protease , prevents cleavage of the viral Gag - Pol polyprotein , resulting in the production of immature , non - infectious viral particles .
Antiviral Activity In the absence of human serum , the mean 50 % effective concentration ( EC 50 ) values of lopinavir against five different HIV - 1 subtype B laboratory strains in lymphoblastic cell lines ranged from 10 - 27 nM ( 0 . 006 - 0 . 017 µg / mL , 1 µg / mL = 1 . 6 µM ) , and ranged from 4 - 11 nM ( 0 . 003 - 0 . 007 µg / mL ) against several HIV - 1 subtype B clinical isolates in peripheral blood lymphocytes ( n = 6 ) .
In the presence of 50 % human serum , the mean EC 50 values of lopinavir against these five HIV - 1 laboratory strains ranged from 65 - 289 nM ( 0 . 04 - 0 . 18 µg / mL ) , representing a 7 to 11 - fold attenuation .
The EC 50 values of lopinavir against three different HIV - 2 strains ranged from 12 - 180 nM ( 0 . 008 - 113 μg / mL ) .
Resistance HIV - 1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to lopinavir have been selected in cell culture .
The presence of ritonavir does not appear to influence the selection of lopinavir - resistant viruses in cell culture .
In a study of 653 antiretroviral treatment - naïve patients ( Study 863 ) , plasma viral isolates from each patient on treatment with plasma HIV - 1 RNA > 400 copies / mL at Week 24 , 32 , 40 and / or 48 were analyzed .
No specific amino acid substitutions could be associated with resistance to KALETRA in the virus from 37 evaluable KALETRA - treated patients .
The selection of resistance to KALETRA in antiretroviral treatment - naïve pediatric patients ( Study 940 ) appears to be consistent with that seen in adult patients ( Study 863 ) .
Resistance to KALETRA has been noted to emerge in patients treated with other protease inhibitors prior to KALETRA therapy .
In studies of 227 antiretroviral treatment - naïve and protease inhibitor experienced patients , isolates from 4 of 23 patients with quantifiable ( > 400 copies / mL ) viral RNA following treatment with KALETRA for 12 to 100 weeks displayed significantly reduced susceptibility to lopinavir compared to the corresponding baseline viral isolates .
All four of these patients had previously received treatment with at least one protease inhibitor and had at least 4 substitutions associated with protease inhibitor resistance immediately prior to KALETRA therapy .
Following viral rebound , isolates from these patients all contained additional substitutions , some of which are recognized to be associated with protease inhibitor resistance .
Cross - resistance - Nonclinical Studies Varying degrees of cross - resistance have been observed among HIV - 1 protease inhibitors .
The antiviral activity in cell culture of lopinavir against clinical isolates from patients previously treated with a single protease inhibitor was determined ( Table 18 ) .
Table 18 .
Susceptibility Reduction to Lopinavir Against Isolates from Patients Previously Treated With a Single Protease InhibitorSusceptibility reduced by > 4 fold Susceptibility reduced to LPV Indinavir ( n = 16 ) 5 . 7 fold Nelfinavir ( n = 13 ) < 4 fold Ritonavir ( n = 3 ) 8 . 32 fold Saquinavir ( n = 4 ) < 4 fold Isolates from patients previously treated with two or more protease inhibitors showed greater reductions in susceptibility to lopinavir , as described in the following section .
Clinical Studies - Antiviral Activity of KALETRA in Patients with Previous Protease Inhibitor Therapies The clinical relevance of reduced susceptibility in cell culture to lopinavir has been examined by assessing the virologic response to KALETRA therapy in treatment - experienced patients , with respect to baseline viral genotype in three studies and baseline viral phenotype in one study .
Virologic response to KALETRA has been shown to be affected by the presence of three or more of the following amino acid substitutions in protease at baseline : L10F / I / R / V , K20M / N / R , L24I , L33F , M36I , I47V , G48V , I54L / T / V , V82A / C / F / S / T , and I84V .
Table 19 shows the 48 - week virologic response ( HIV - 1 RNA < 400 copies / mL ) according to the number of the above protease inhibitor resistance - associated substitutions at baseline in studies 888 and 765 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) and ( 14 . 3 ) ] and study 957 ( see below ) .
Once daily administration of KALETRA for adult patients with three or more of the above substitutions is not recommended .

4 86 % indinavir , 54 % nelfinavir , 80 % ritonavir , 70 % saquinavir .
Virologic response to KALETRA therapy with respect to phenotypic susceptibility to lopinavir at baseline was examined in Study 957 .
In this study 56 NNRTI - naïve patients with HIV - 1 RNA > 1 , 000 copies / mL despite previous therapy with at least two protease inhibitors selected from indinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , and saquinavir were randomized to receive one of two doses of KALETRA in combination with efavirenz and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) .
The EC 50 values of lopinavir against the 56 baseline viral isolates ranged from 0 . 5 - to 96 - fold the wild - type EC 50 value .
Fifty - five percent ( 31 / 56 ) of these baseline isolates displayed > 4 - fold reduced susceptibility to lopinavir .
These 31 isolates had a median reduction in lopinavir susceptibility of 18 - fold .
Response to therapy by baseline lopinavir susceptibility is shown in Table 20 .

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Lopinavir / ritonavir combination was evaluated for carcinogenic potential by oral gavage administration to mice and rats for up to 104 weeks .
Results showed an increase in the incidence of benign hepatocellular adenomas and an increase in the combined incidence of hepatocellular adenomas plus carcinoma in both males and females in mice and males in rats at doses that produced approximately 1 . 6 - 2 . 2 times ( mice ) and 0 . 5 times ( rats ) the human exposure ( based on AUC 0 - 24 hr measurement ) at the recommended dose of 400 / 100 mg KALETRA twice daily .
Administration of lopinavir / ritonavir did not cause a statistically significant increase in the incidence of any other benign or malignant neoplasm in mice or rats .
Carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats have been carried out on ritonavir .
In male mice , there was a dose dependent increase in the incidence of both adenomas and combined adenomas and carcinomas in the liver .
Based on AUC measurements , the exposure at the high dose was approximately 4 - fold for males that of the exposure in humans with the recommended therapeutic dose ( 400 / 100 mg KALETRA twice daily ) .
There were no carcinogenic effects seen in females at the dosages tested .
The exposure at the high dose was approximately 9 - fold for the females that of the exposure in humans .
There were no carcinogenic effects in rats .
In this study , the exposure at the high dose was approximately 0 . 7 - fold that of the exposure in humans with the 400 / 100 mg KALETRA twice daily regimen .
Based on the exposures achieved in the animal studies , the significance of the observed effects is not known .
Mutagenesis Neither lopinavir nor ritonavir was found to be mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay using S . typhimurium and E . coli , the mouse lymphoma assay , the mouse micronucleus test and chromosomal aberration assays in human lymphocytes .
Impairment of Fertility Lopinavir in combination with ritonavir at a 2 : 1 ratio produced no effects on fertility in male and female rats at levels of 10 / 5 , 30 / 15 or 100 / 50 mg / kg / day .
Based on AUC measurements , the exposures in rats at the high doses were approximately 0 . 7 - fold for lopinavir and 1 . 8 - fold for ritonavir of the exposures in humans at the recommended therapeutic dose ( 400 / 100 mg twice daily ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Adult Patients without Prior Antiretroviral Therapy Study 863 : KALETRA Capsules twice daily + stavudine + lamivudine compared to nelfinavir three times daily + stavudine + lamivudine Study 863 was a randomized , double - blind , multicenter trial comparing treatment with KALETRA capsules ( 400 / 100 mg twice daily ) plus stavudine and lamivudine versus nelfinavir ( 750 mg three times daily ) plus stavudine and lamivudine in 653 antiretroviral treatment naïve patients .
Patients had a mean age of 38 years ( range : 19 to 84 ) , 57 % were Caucasian , and 80 % were male .
Mean baseline CD4 + cell count was 259 cells / mm 3 ( range : 2 to 949 cells / mm 3 ) and mean baseline plasma HIV - 1 RNA was 4 . 9 log 10 copies / mL ( range : 2 . 6 to 6 . 8 log 10 copies / mL ) .
Treatment response and outcomes of randomized treatment are presented in Table 21 .

Twenty - seven patients ( 39 % ) discontinued the study , including 5 ( 7 % ) discontinuations secondary to adverse reactions and 2 ( 3 % ) deaths .
14 . 4 Pediatric Studies Study 1030 was an open - label , multicenter , dose - finding trial evaluating the pharmacokinetic profile , tolerability , safety and efficacy of KALETRA oral solution containing lopinavir 80 mg / mL and ritonavir 20 mg / mL at a dose of 300 / 75 mg / m 2 twice daily plus 2 NRTIs in HIV - 1 infected infants ≥ 14 days and < 6 months of age .
Ten infants , ≥ 14 days and < 6 wks of age , were enrolled at a median ( range ) age of 5 . 7 ( 3 . 6 - 6 . 0 ) weeks and all completed 24 weeks .
At entry , median ( range ) HIV - 1 RNA was 6 . 0 ( 4 . 7 - 7 . 2 ) log 10 copies / mL .
Seven of 10 infants had HIV - 1 RNA < 400 copies / mL at Week 24 .
At entry , median ( range ) CD4 + percentage was 41 ( 16 - 59 ) with a median decrease of 1 % ( 95 % CI : - 10 , 18 ) from baseline to week 24 in 6 infants with available data .
Twenty - one infants , between 6 weeks and 6 months of age , were enrolled at a median ( range ) age of 14 . 7 ( 6 . 9 - 25 . 7 ) weeks and 19 of 21 infants completed 24 weeks .
At entry , median ( range ) HIV RNA level was 5 . 8 ( 3 . 7 - 6 . 9 ) log 10 copies / mL .
Ten of 21 infants had HIV RNA < 400 copies / mL at Week 24 .
At entry , the median ( range ) CD4 + percentage was 32 ( 11 - 54 ) with a median increase of 4 % ( 95 % CI : - 1 , 9 ) from baseline to week 24 in 19 infants with available data [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) for pharmacokinetic results ] .
Study 940 was an open - label , multicenter trial evaluating the pharmacokinetic profile , tolerability , safety and efficacy of KALETRA oral solution containing lopinavir 80 mg / mL and ritonavir 20 mg / mL in 100 antiretroviral naïve ( 44 % ) and experienced ( 56 % ) pediatric patients .
All patients were non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor naïve .
Patients were randomized to either 230 mg lopinavir / 57 . 5 mg ritonavir per m 2 or 300 mg lopinavir / 75 mg ritonavir per m 2 .
Naïve patients also received lamivudine and stavudine .
Experienced patients received nevirapine plus up to two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors .
Safety , efficacy and pharmacokinetic profiles of the two dose regimens were assessed after three weeks of therapy in each patient .
After analysis of these data , all patients were continued on the 300 mg lopinavir / 75 mg ritonavir per m 2 dose .
Patients had a mean age of 5 years ( range 6 months to 12 years ) with 14 % less than 2 years .
Mean baseline CD4 + cell count was 838 cells / mm 3 and mean baseline plasma HIV - 1 RNA was 4 . 7 log 10 copies / mL .
Through 48 weeks of therapy , the proportion of patients who achieved and sustained an HIV - 1 RNA < 400 copies / mL was 80 % for antiretroviral naïve patients and 71 % for antiretroviral experienced patients .
The mean increase from baseline in CD4 + cell count was 404 cells / mm 3 for antiretroviral naïve and 284 cells / mm 3 for antiretroviral experienced patients treated through 48 weeks .
At 48 weeks , two patients ( 2 % ) had prematurely discontinued the study .
One antiretroviral naïve patient prematurely discontinued secondary to an adverse reaction , while one antiretroviral experienced patient prematurely discontinued secondary to an HIV - 1 related event .
Dose selection in pediatric patients was based on the following : • Among patients 14 days to 6 months of age receiving 300 / 75 mg / m 2 twice daily without nevirapine , plasma concentrations were lower than those observed in adults or in older children .
This dose resulted in HIV - 1 RNA < 400 copies / mL in 55 % of patients ( 70 % in those initiating treatment at < 6 weeks of age ) .
• Among patients 6 months to 12 years of age , the 230 / 57 . 5 mg / m 2 oral solution twice daily regimen without nevirapine and the 300 / 75 mg / m 2 oral solution twice daily regimen with nevirapine provided lopinavir plasma concentrations similar to those obtained in adult patients receiving the 400 / 100 mg twice daily regimen ( without nevirapine ) .
These doses resulted in treatment benefit ( proportion of patients with HIV - 1 RNA < 400 copies / mL ) similar to that seen in the adult clinical trials .
• Among patients 12 to 18 years of age receiving 400 / 100 mg / m 2 or 480 / 120 mg / m 2 ( with efavirenz ) twice daily , plasma concentrations were 60 - 100 % higher than among 6 to 12 year old patients receiving 230 / 57 . 5 mg / m 2 .
Mean apparent clearance was similar to that observed in adult patients receiving standard dose and in patients 6 to 12 years of age .
Although changes in HIV - 1 RNA in patients with prior treatment failure were less than anticipated , the pharmacokinetic data supports use of similar dosing as in patients 6 to 12 years of age , not to exceed the recommended adult dose .
• For all age groups , the body surface area dosing was converted to body weight dosing using the patient ’ s prescribed lopinavir dose .
