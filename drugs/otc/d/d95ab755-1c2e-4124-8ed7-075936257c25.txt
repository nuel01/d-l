1 INDICATIONS & USAGE For the prevention and treatment of portal - systemic encephalopathy , including the stages of hepatic pre - coma and coma .
Controlled studies have shown that lactulose solution therapy reduces the blood ammonia levels by 25 to 50 % ; this is generally paralleled by an improvement in the patients ' mental state and by an improvement in EEG patterns .
The clinical response has been observed in about 75 % of patients , which is at least as satisfactory as that resulting from neomycin therapy .
An increase in patients ' protein tolerance is also frequently observed with lactulose therapy .
In the treatment of chronic portal - systemic encephalopathy , Lactulose has been given for over 2 years in controlled studies .
2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Oral Adult : The usual adult , oral dosage is 2 to 3 tablespoonfuls ( 30 to 45 mL , containing 20 g to 30 g of lactulose ) three or four times daily .
The dosage may be adjusted every day or two to produce 2 or 3 soft stools daily .
Hourly doses of 30 to 45 mL of Lactulose may be used to induce the rapid laxation indicated in the initial phase of the therapy of portal - systemic encephalopathy .
When the laxative effect has been achieved , the dose of lactulose may then be reduced to the recommended daily dose .
Improvement in the patient ' s condition may occur within 24 hours but may not begin before 48 hours or even later .
Continuous long - term therapy is indicated to lessen the severity and prevent the recurrence of portal - systemic encephalopathy .
The dose of lactulose for this purpose is the same as the recommended daily dose .
Pediatric : Very little information on the use of lactulose in young children and adolescents has been recorded .
As with adults , the subjective goal in proper treatment is to produce 2 to 3 soft stools daily .
On the basis of information available , the recommended initial daily oral dose in infants is 2 . 5 to 10 mL in divided doses .
For older children and adolescents , the total daily dose is 40 to 90 ml .
If the initial dose causes diarrhea , the dose should be reduced immediately .
If diarrhea persists , lactulose should be discontinued .
Rectal When the adult patient is in the impending coma or coma stage of portal - systemic encephalopathy and the danger of aspiration exists , or when the necessary endoscopic or intubation procedures physically interfere with the administration of the recommended oral doses , lactulose solution may be given as a retention enema via a rectal balloon catheter .
Cleansing enemas containing soapsuds or other alkaline agents should not be used .
Three hundred ml of lactulose solution should be mixed with 700 mL of water or physiologic saline and retained for 30 to 60 minutes .
Lactulose enema may be repeated every 4 to 6 hours .
If the enema is inadvertently evacuated too promptly , it may be repeated immediately .
The goal of treatment is reversal of the coma stage in order that the patient may be able to take oral medication .
Reversal of coma may take place within 2 hours of the first enema in some patients .
Lactulose , given orally in the recommended doses , should be started before Lactulose by enema is stopped entirely .
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Since lactulose solution contains galactose ( less than 1 . 6 g / 15 mL ) , it is contraindicated in patients who require a low galactose diet .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Precise frequency data are not available .
Lactulose may produce gaseous distention with flatulence or belching and abdominal discomfort such as cramping in about 20 % of patients .
Excessive dosage can lead to diarrhea with potential complications such as loss of fluids , hypokalemia , and hypernatremia .
Nausea and vomiting have been reported .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS There have been conflicting reports about the concomitant use of neomycin and lactulose solution .
Theoretically , the elimination of certain colonic bacteria by neomycin and possibly other anti - infective agents may interfere with the desired degradation of lactulose and thus prevent the acidification of colonic contents .
Thus the status of the lactulose - treated patient should be closely monitored in the event of concomitant oral anti - infective therapy .
Results of preliminary studies in humans and rats suggest that nonabsorbable antacids given concurrently with lactulose may inhibit the desired lactulose - induced drop in colonic pH . Therefore , a possible lack of desired effect of treatment should be taken into consideration before such drugs are given concomitantly with lactulose .
Other laxatives should not be used , especially during the initial phase of therapy for portal - systemic encephalopathy , because the loose stools resulting from their use may falsely suggest that adequate lactulose dosage has been achieved .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category B . Reproduction studies have been performed in mice , rats , and rabbits at doses up to 2 or 4 times the usual human oral dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to lactulose .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when lactulose solution is administered to a nursing woman .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Very little information on the use of lactulose in pediatric patients has been recorded .
( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION . )
10 OVERDOSAGE Signs And Symptoms There have been no reports of accidental overdosage .
In the event of overdosage , it is expected that diarrhea and abdominal cramps would be the major symptoms .
Medication should be terminated .
Oral LD50 : The acute oral LD 50 of the drug is 48 . 8 mL / kg in mice and greater than 30 mL / kg in rats .
Dialysis : Dialysis data are not available for lactulose .
Its molecular similarity to sucrose , however , would suggest that it should be dialyzable .
11 DESCRIPTION Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide in solution form for oral or rectal administration .
Each 15 mL of lactulose solution contains : 10 g lactulose ( and less than 1 . 6 g galactose , less than 1 . 2 g lactose , and 0 . 1 g or less of fructose ) .
Lactulose is a colonic acidifier for treatment and prevention of portal - systemic encephalopathy .
The chemical name for lactulose is 4 - O - β - D - galactopyranosyl - D - fructofuranose .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The molecular weight is 342 . 30 .
It is freely soluble in water .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Lactulose causes a decrease in blood ammonia concentration and reduces the degree of portalsystemic encephalopathy .
These actions are considered to be results of the following : Bacterial degradation of lactulose in the colon acidifies the colonic contents .
This acidification of colonic contents results in the retention of ammonia in the colon as the ammonium ion .
Since the colonic contents are then more acid than the blood , ammonia can be expected to migrate from the blood into the colon to form the ammonium ion .
The acid colonic contents convert NH 3 to the ammonium ion ( NH 4 ) + , trapping it and preventing its absorption .
The laxative action of the metabolites of lactulose then expels the trapped ammonium ion from the colon .
Experimental data indicate that lactulose is poorly absorbed .
Lactulose given orally to man and experimental animals resulted in only small amounts reaching the blood .
Urinary excretion has been determined to be 3 % or less and is essentially complete within 24 hours .
When incubated with extracts of human small intestinal mucosa , lactulose was not hydrolyzed during a 24 - hour period and did not inhibit the activity of these extracts on lactose .
Lactulose reaches the colon essentially unchanged .
There it is metabolized by bacteria with the formation of low molecular weight acids that acidify the colon contents .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis & Mutagenesis & Impairment Of Fertility There are no known human data on long - term potential for carcinogenicity , mutagenicity , or impairment of fertility .
There are no known animal data on long - term potential for mutagenicity .
Administration of lactulose solution in the diet of mice for 18 months in concentrations of 3 and 10 percent ( v / w ) did not produce any evidence of carcinogenicity .
In studies of mice , rats , and rabbits , doses of lactulose solution up to 6 or 12 mL / kg / day produced no deleterious effects in breeding , conception , or parturition .
