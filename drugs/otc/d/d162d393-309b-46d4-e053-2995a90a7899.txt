Final concentration Mix Vasostrict ® Diluent No 0 . 1 units / mL 2 . 5 mL ( 50 units ) 500 mL Yes 1 unit / mL 5 mL ( 100 units ) 100 mL Vasostrict ® Premixed Solution , 40 units / 100 mL ( 0 . 4 units / mL ) and 60 units / 100 mL ( 0 . 6 units / mL ) This product does not require further dilution prior to administration .
2 . 2 Administration In general , titrate to the lowest dose compatible with a clinically acceptable response .
The recommended starting dose is : Post - cardiotomy shock : 0 . 03 units / minute Septic Shock : 0 . 01 units / minute Titrate up by 0 . 005 units / minute at 10 - to 15 - minute intervals until the target blood pressure is reached .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : May induce uterine contractions .
( 8 . 1 ) • Pediatric Use : Safety and effectiveness have not been established .
( 8 . 4 ) • Geriatric Use : No safety issues have been identified in older patients .
( 8 . 5 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Vasostrict ® use in pregnant women to inform a drug associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted .
Clinical Considerations Dose adjustments during pregnancy and the postpartum period : Because of increased clearance of vasopressin in the second and third trimester , the dose of Vasostrict ® may need to be increased [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Maternal adverse reactions : Vasostrict ® may produce tonic uterine contractions that could threaten the continuation of pregnancy .
8 . 2 Lactation There are no data on the presence of vasopressin injection in either human or animal milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of Vasostrict ® in pediatric patients with vasodilatory shock have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of vasopressin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Overdosage with Vasostrict ® can be expected to manifest as consequences of vasoconstriction of various vascular beds ( peripheral , mesenteric , and coronary ) and as hyponatremia .
In addition , overdosage may lead less commonly to ventricular tachyarrhythmias ( including Torsade de Pointes ) , rhabdomyolysis , and non - specific gastrointestinal symptoms .
Direct effects will resolve within minutes of withdrawal of treatment .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Vasopressin causes vasoconstriction by binding to V1 receptors on vascular smooth muscle coupled to the Gq / 11 - phospholipase C - phosphatidyl - inositol - triphosphate pathway , resulting in the release of intracellular calcium .
In addition , vasopressin stimulates antidiuresis via stimulation of V 2 receptors which are coupled to adenyl cyclase .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics At therapeutic doses exogenous vasopressin elicits a vasoconstrictive effect in most vascular beds including the splanchnic , renal and cutaneous circulation .
In addition , vasopressin at pressor doses triggers contractions of smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal tract mediated by muscular V 1 - receptors and release of prolactin and ACTH via V 3 receptors .
At lower concentrations typical for the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin inhibits water diuresis via renal V 2 receptors .
In addition , vasopressin has been demonstrated to cause vasodilation in numerous vascular beds that are mediated by V2 , V 3 , oxytocin and purinergic P2 receptors .
In patients with vasodilatory shock vasopressin in therapeutic doses increases systemic vascular resistance and mean arterial blood pressure and reduces the dose requirements for norepinephrine .
Vasopressin tends to decrease heart rate and cardiac output .
The pressor effect is proportional to the infusion rate of exogenous vasopressin .
The pressor effect reaches its peak within 15 minutes .
After stopping the infusion the pressor effect fades within 20 minutes .
There is no evidence for tachyphylaxis or tolerance to the pressor effect of vasopressin in patients .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Vasopressin plasma concentrations increase linearly with increasing infusion rates from 10 to 200 μU / kg / min .
Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved after 30 minutes of continuous intravenous infusion .
Distribution Vasopressin does not appear to bind plasma protein .
The volume of distribution is 140 mL / kg .
Elimination At infusion rates used in vasodilatory shock ( 0 . 01 to 0 . 1 units / minute ) , the clearance of vasopressin is 9 to 25 mL / min / kg in patients with vasodilatory shock .
The apparent t 1 / 2 of vasopressin at these levels is ≤ 10 minutes .
Metabolism Serine protease , carboxipeptidase and disulfide oxido - reductase cleave vasopressin at sites relevant for the pharmacological activity of the hormone .
Thus , the generated metabolites are not expected to retain important pharmacological activity .
Excretion Vasopressin is predominantly metabolized and only about 6 % of the dose is excreted unchanged into urine .
Specific Populations Pregnancy : Because of a spillover into blood of placental vasopressinase , the clearance of exogenous and endogenous vasopressin increases gradually over the course of a pregnancy .
During the first trimester of pregnancy , the clearance is only slightly increased .
However , by the third trimester the clearance of vasopressin is increased about 4 - fold and at term up to 5 - fold .
After delivery , the clearance of vasopressin returns to preconception baseline within two weeks .
Drug Interactions Indomethacin more than doubles the time to offset for vasopressin ’ s effect on peripheral vascular resistance and cardiac output in healthy subjects [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
The ganglionic blocking agent tetra - ethylammonium increases the pressor effect of vasopressin by 20 % in healthy subjects [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) ] .
Halothane , morphine , fentanyl , alfentanyl and sufentanyl do not impact exposure to endogenous vasopressin .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No formal carcinogenicity or fertility studies with vasopressin have been conducted in animals .
Vasopressin was found to be negative in the in vitro bacterial mutagenicity ( Ames ) test and the in vitro Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell chromosome aberration test .
In mice , vasopressin has been reported to have an effect on function and fertilizing ability of spermatozoa .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology No toxicology studies were conducted with vasopressin .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Increases in systolic and mean blood pressure following administration of vasopressin were observed in 7 studies in septic shock and 8 in post - cardiotomy vasodilatory shock .
