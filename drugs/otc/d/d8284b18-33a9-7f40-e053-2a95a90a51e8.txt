DESCRIPTION SECTION for RadioGenix System 1 . 2 11 . 1 Chemical Characteristics The RadioGenix System provides Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m Injection , USP for intravenous use , intravesicular use , ophthalmic use , or for preparing radiopharmaceutical kits .
The RadioGenix System uses a non - uranium potassium molybdate Mo - 99 source solution to produce Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m Injection , USP .
The RadioGenix ® System uses potassium molybdate Mo - 99 sources at an activity of 7 . 5 Ci ( 277 . 5 GBq ) , 12 Ci ( 444 GBq ) , 15 Ci ( 555 GBq ) , and 19 Ci ( 703 GBq ) at the date and time of calibration .
Elution of RadioGenix System produces Sodium Pertechnetate Tc - 99 m ( Na99mTcO4 ) in approximately 5 mL of sterile 0 . 9 % sodium chloride injection , USP solution .
The activity of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc - 99 m produced varies ( 4 mCi / mL to 2 , 135 mCi / mL of technetium Tc - 99 m ) and depends on the activity of potassium molybdate Mo - 99 present in the source container originally , the decay time since the calibration time , and the elapsed time since the previous Sodium Pertechnetate Tc - 99 m elution .
Sodium Pertechnetate Tc - 99 m is an inorganic compound with the formula Na99mTcO4 .
In solution , Sodium Pertechnetate exists as dissociated Na + cations and pertechnetate TcO4 - anions with the following molecular structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] The eluted Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m Injection , USP is a sterile , non - pyrogenic , clear , and colorless solution .
The pH of the solution is between 4 . 5 and 7 . 5 .
11 . 2 Physical Characteristics Technetium Tc - 99 m Technetium Tc - 99 m decays by isomeric transition with a physical half - life of 6 . 01 hours .
The principal photon that is useful for detection and imaging studies is shown in Table 7 .

A range of values for the relative radiation attenuation by the various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 8 .
For example , the use of 3 mm thickness of Pb will attenuate the radiation exposure by a factor of about 1 , 000 .

RadioGenix System elutions may be made at any time , but the amount of technetium Tc - 99 m available will depend on the time interval measured from the last elution cycle .
Eluting the RadioGenix System every 24 hours will provide the maximal yield of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc - 99 m .
To correct for physical decay of technetium Tc - 99 m , the fractions that remain at selected intervals of time are shown in Table 10 .

In contrast to the iodide ion , the pertechnetate is released unchanged from the thyroid gland .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Pertechnetate concentrates in the thyroid gland , salivary glands , gastric mucosa and choroid plexus .
After intravenous administration , it equilibrates with the extracellular space .
Following the administration of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc - 99 m as an eye drop , the drug mixes with tears within the conjunctival space .
Within seconds to minutes it leaves the conjunctival space and escapes into the inferior meatus of the nose through the nasolacrimal drainage system .
During this process the pertechnetate ions pass through the canaliculi , the lacrimal sac , and the nasolacrimal duct .
In the event of any anatomical or functional blockage of the drainage system there will be a backflow resulting in tearing ( epiphora ) .
Thus , the pertechnetate escapes the conjunctival space in the tears .
The majority of the pertechnetate escapes within a few minutes of normal drainage and tearing .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Times to peak concentrations of pertechnetate following intravenous administration are 3 . 5 hours for cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) and 0 . 25 to 2 hours for thyroid ( euthyroid patients ) .
The disappearance of pertechnetate from plasma is biexponential with an initial phase of 10 minutes and a terminal phase of 3 hours .
The corresponding phases in CSF are less than 1 hour and 11 - 12 hours , respectively .
Distribution : Pertechnetate distributes throughout the body concentrating in the gastric mucosa , thyroid gland , salivary glands , and urinary bladder .
Elimination : Excretion : Elimination by urinary route is 27 % in 1 day , 31 % in 4 days , and 34 % in 8 days based on rate of excretion NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY SECTION for RadioGenix System 1 . 2 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No long - term studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , mutagenicity potential , or to determine whether Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m Injection may affect fertility in males or females .
