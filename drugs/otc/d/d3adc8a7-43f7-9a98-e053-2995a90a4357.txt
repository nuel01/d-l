INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenazopyridine is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain , burning , urgency , frequency , and other discomforts arising from irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa caused by infection , trauma , surgery , endoscopic procedures , or the passage of sounds or catheters .
The use of Phenazopyridine HCl for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions .
Because it provides only symptomatic relief , prompt appropriate treatment of the cause of pain must be instituted and Phenazopyridine HCl should be discontinued when symptoms are controlled .
The analgesic action may reduce or eliminate the need for systemic analgesics or narcotics .
It is , however , compatible with antibacterial therapy and can help to relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antibacterial therapy controls the infection .
Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine HCl should not exceed two days because there is a lack of evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine HCl and an antibacterial provides greater benefit than administration of the antibacterial alone after two days .
( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section . )
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 200 mg Tablets : Average adult dosage is one tablet 3 times a day after meals .
When used concomitantly with an antibacterial agent for the treatment of a urinary tract infection , the administration of Phenazopyridine HCl should not exceed 2 days .
