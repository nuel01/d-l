WARNING : BLEEDING RISK See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning .
• Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding .
( 5 . 1 ) • Perform regular monitoring of INR in all treated patients .
( 2 . 1 ) • Drugs , dietary changes , and other factors affect INR levels achieved with warfarin sodium therapy .
( 7 ) • Instruct patients about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding .
( 17 ) 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Warfarin sodium tablets are indicated for : • Prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombosis and its extension , pulmonary embolism ( PE ) .
• Prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic complications associated with atrial fibrillation ( AF ) and / or cardiac valve replacement .
• Reduction in the risk of death , recurrent myocardial infarction ( MI ) , and thromboembolic events such as stroke or systemic embolization after myocardial infarction .
Limitations of Use Warfarin sodium tablets have no direct effect on an established thrombus , nor does it reverse ischemic tissue damage .
Once a thrombus has occurred , however , the goals of anticoagulant treatment are to prevent further extension of the formed clot and to prevent secondary thromboembolic complications that may result in serious and possibly fatal sequelae .
Warfarin sodium tablets are vitamin K antagonist indicated for : • Prophylaxis and treatment of venous thrombosis and its extension , pulmonary embolism .
( 1 ) • Prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic complications associated with atrial fibrillation and / or cardiac valve replacement .
( 1 ) • Reduction in the risk of death , recurrent myocardial infarction , and thromboembolic events such as stroke or systemic embolization after myocardial infarction .
( 1 ) Limitations of Use Warfarin sodium tablets have no direct effect on an established thrombus , nor does it reverse ischemic tissue damage .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Individualize dosing regimen for each patient , and adjust based on INR response .
( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 ) • Knowledge of genotype can inform initial dose selection .
( 2 . 3 ) • Monitoring : Obtain daily INR determinations upon initiation until stable in the therapeutic range .
Obtain subsequent INR determinations every 1 to 4 weeks .
( 2 . 4 ) • Review conversion instructions from other anticoagulants .
( 2 . 8 ) 2 . 1 Individualized Dosing The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium must be individualized for each patient according to the patient ’ s International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) response to the drug .
Adjust the dose based on the patient ’ s INR and the condition being treated .
Consult the latest evidence - based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions .
2 . 2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications An INR of greater than 4 . 0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding .
Venous Thromboembolism ( including deep venous thrombosis [ DVT ] and PE ) Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2 . 5 ( INR range , 2 . 0 to 3 . 0 ) for all treatment durations .
The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows : • For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient ( reversible ) risk factor , treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended .
• For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE , treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months .
After 3 months of therapy , evaluate the risk - benefit ratio of long - term treatment for the individual patient .
• For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE , long - term treatment with warfarin is recommended .
For a patient receiving long - term anticoagulant treatment , periodically reassess the risk - benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient .
Atrial Fibrillation In patients with non - valvular AF , anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 2 . 5 ( range , 2 . 0 to 3 . 0 ) .
• In patients with non - valvular AF that is persistent or paroxysmal and at high risk of stroke ( i . e . , having any of the following features : prior ischemic stroke , transient ischemic attack , or systemic embolism , or 2 of the following risk factors : age greater than 75 years , moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and / or heart failure , history of hypertension , or diabetes mellitus ) , long - term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended .
• In patients with non - valvular AF that is persistent or paroxysmal and at an intermediate risk of ischemic stroke ( i . e . , having 1 of the following risk factors : age greater than 75 years , moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and / or heart failure , history of hypertension , or diabetes mellitus ) , long - term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended .
• For patients with AF and mitral stenosis , long - term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended .
• For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves , long - term anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended ; the target INR may be increased and aspirin added depending on valve type and position , and on patient factors .
Mechanical and Bioprosthetic Heart Valves • For patients with a bileaflet mechanical valve or a Medtronic Hall ( Minneapolis , MN ) tilting disk valve in the aortic position who are in sinus rhythm and without left atrial enlargement , therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 2 . 5 ( range , 2 . 0 to 3 . 0 ) is recommended .
• For patients with tilting disk valves and bileaflet mechanical valves in the mitral position , therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 3 . 0 ( range , 2 . 5 to 3 . 5 ) is recommended .
• For patients with caged ball or caged disk valves , therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 3 . 0 ( range , 2 . 5 to 3 . 5 ) is recommended .
• For patients with a bioprosthetic valve in the mitral position , therapy with warfarin to a target INR of 2 . 5 ( range , 2 . 0 to 3 . 0 ) for the first 3 months after valve insertion is recommended .
If additional risk factors for thromboembolism are present ( AF , previous thromboembolism , left ventricular dysfunction ) , a target INR of 2 . 5 ( range , 2 . 0 to 3 . 0 ) is recommended .
Post - Myocardial Infarction • For high - risk patients with MI ( e . g . , those with a large anterior MI , those with significant heart failure , those with intracardiac thrombus visible on transthoracic echocardiography , those with AF , and those with a history of a thromboembolic event ) , therapy with combined moderate - intensity ( INR , 2 . 0 to 3 . 0 ) warfarin plus low - dose aspirin ( ≤ 100 mg / day ) for at least 3 months after the MI is recommended .
Recurrent Systemic Embolism and Other Indications Oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin has not been fully evaluated by clinical trials in patients with valvular disease associated with AF , patients with mitral stenosis , and patients with recurrent systemic embolism of unknown etiology .
However , a moderate dose regimen ( INR 2 . 0 to 3 . 0 ) may be used for these patients .
2 . 3 Initial and Maintenance Dosing The appropriate initial dosing of warfarin sodium varies widely for different patients .
Not all factors responsible for warfarin dose variability are known , and the initial dose is influenced by : • Clinical factors including age , race , body weight , sex , concomitant medications , and comorbidities • Genetic factors ( CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes ) [ seeClinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 5 ) ] Select the initial dose based on the expected maintenance dose , taking into account the above factors .
Modify this dose based on consideration of patient - specific clinical factors .
Consider lower initial and maintenance doses for elderly and / or debilitated patients and in Asian patients [ seeUse in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Routine use of loading doses is not recommended as this practice may increase hemorrhagic and other complications and does not offer more rapid protection against clot formation .
Individualize the duration of therapy for each patient .
In general , anticoagulant therapy should be continued until the danger of thrombosis and embolism has passed [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Dosing Recommendations without Consideration of Genotype If the patient ' s CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes are not known , the initial dose of warfarin sodium is usually 2 to 5 mg once daily .
Determine each patient ’ s dosing needs by close monitoring of the INR response and consideration of the indication being treated .
Typical maintenance doses are 2 to 10 mg once daily .
Dosing Recommendations with Consideration of Genotype Table 1 displays three ranges of expected maintenance warfarin sodium doses observed in subgroups of patients having different combinations of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 gene variants [ seeClinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 5 ) ] .
If the patient ’ s CYP2C9 and / or VKORC1 genotype are known , consider these ranges in choosing the initial dose .
Patients with CYP2C9 * 1 / * 3 , * 2 / * 2 , * 2 / * 3 , and * 3 / * 3 may require more prolonged time ( > 2 to 4 weeks ) to achieve maximum INR effect for a given dosage regimen than patients without these CYP variants .
Table 1 : Three Ranges of Expected Maintenance Warfarin Sodium Daily Doses Based on CYP2C9 and VKORC1 Genotypes † VKORC1 CYP2C9 * 1 / * 1 * 1 / * 2 * 1 / * 3 * 2 / * 2 * 2 / * 3 * 3 / * 3 GG 5 - 7 mg 5 - 7 mg 3 - 4 mg 3 - 4 mg 3 - 4 mg 0 . 5 - 2 mg AG 5 - 7 mg 3 - 4 mg 3 - 4 mg 3 - 4 mg 0 . 5 - 2 mg 0 . 5 - 2 mg AA 3 - 4 mg 3 - 4 mg 0 . 5 - 2 mg 0 . 5 - 2 mg 0 . 5 - 2 mg 0 . 5 - 2 mg † Ranges are derived from multiple published clinical studies .
VKORC1 - 1639 G > A ( rs9923231 ) variant is used in this table .
Other co - inherited VKORC1 variants may also be important determinants of warfarin dose .
2 . 4 Monitoring to Achieve Optimal Anticoagulation Warfarin sodium is a narrow therapeutic range ( index ) , and its action may be affected by factors such as other drugs and dietary vitamin K . Therefore , anticoagulation must be carefully monitored during warfarin sodium therapy .
Determine the INR daily after the administration of the initial dose until INR results stabilize in the therapeutic range .
After stabilization , maintain dosing within the therapeutic range by performing periodic INRs .
The frequency of performing INR should be based on the clinical situation but generally acceptable intervals for INR determinations are 1 to 4 weeks .
Perform additional INR tests when other warfarin products are interchanged with warfarin sodium as well as whenever other medications are initiated , discontinued , or taken irregularly .
Heparin , a common concomitant drug , increases the INR [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 8 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Determinations of whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for monitoring of warfarin sodium therapy .
2 . 5 Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal failure .
Monitor INR more frequently in patients with compromised renal function to maintain INR within the therapeutic range [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
2 . 6 Missed Dose The anticoagulant effect of warfarin sodium persists beyond 24 hours .
If a patient misses a dose of warfarin sodium at the intended time of day , the patient should take the dose as soon as possible on the same day .
The patient should not double the dose the next day to make up for a missed dose .
2 . 7 Treatment During Dentistry and Surgery Some dental or surgical procedures may necessitate the interruption or change in the dose of warfarin sodium therapy .
Consider the benefits and risks when discontinuing warfarin sodium even for a short period of time .
Determine the INR immediately prior to any dental or surgical procedure .
In patients undergoing minimally invasive procedures who must be anticoagulated prior to , during , or immediately following these procedures , adjusting the dosage of warfarin sodium to maintain the INR at the low end of the therapeutic range may safely allow for continued anticoagulation .
2 . 8 Conversion From Other Anticoagulants Heparin Since the full anticoagulant effect of warfarin sodium is not achieved for several days , heparin is preferred for initial rapid anticoagulation .
During initial therapy with warfarin sodium , the interference with heparin anticoagulation is of minimal clinical significance .
Conversion to warfarin sodium may begin concomitantly with heparin therapy or may be delayed 3 to 6 days .
To ensure therapeutic anticoagulation , continue full dose heparin therapy and overlap warfarin sodium therapy with heparin for 4 to 5 days and until warfarin sodium has produced the desired therapeutic response as determined by INR , at which point heparin may be discontinued .
As heparin may affect the INR , patients receiving both heparin and warfarin sodium should have INR monitoring at least : • 5 hours after the last intravenous bolus dose of heparin , or • 4 hours after cessation of a continuous intravenous infusion of heparin , or • 24 hours after the last subcutaneous heparin injection .
Warfarin sodium may increase the activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) test , even in the absence of heparin .
A severe elevation ( > 50 seconds ) in aPTT with an INR in the desired range has been identified as an indication of increased risk of postoperative hemorrhage .
Other Anticoagulants Consult the labeling of other anticoagulants for instructions on conversion to warfarin sodium .

Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Warfarin sodium exposure during pregnancy causes a recognized pattern of major congenital malformations ( warfarin embryopathy and fetotoxicity ) , fatal fetal hemorrhage , and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal mortality .
If warfarin sodium is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Warfarin Sodium is contraindicated in patients with : • Hemorrhagic tendencies or blood dyscrasias • Recent or contemplated surgery of the central nervous system or eye , or traumatic surgery resulting in large open surfaces [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] • Bleeding tendencies associated with : − Active ulceration or overt bleeding of the gastrointestinal , genitourinary , or respiratory tract − Central nervous system hemorrhage − Cerebral aneurysms , dissecting aorta − Pericarditis and pericardial effusions − Bacterial endocarditis • Threatened abortion , eclampsia , and preeclampsia • Unsupervised patients with conditions associated with potential high level of non - compliance • Spinal puncture and other diagnostic or therapeutic procedures with potential for uncontrollable bleeding • Hypersensitivity to warfarin or to any other components of this product ( e . g . , anaphylaxis ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) ] • Major regional or lumbar block anesthesia • Malignant hypertension • Pregnancy , except in women with mechanical heart valves .
( 4 , 5 . 7 , 8 . 1 ) • Hemorrhagic tendencies or blood dyscrasias .
( 4 ) • Recent or contemplated surgery of the central nervous system ( CNS ) or eye , or traumatic surgery resulting in large open surfaces .
( 4 , 5 . 8 ) • Bleeding tendencies associated with certain conditions .
( 4 ) • Threatened abortion , eclampsia , and preeclampsia .
( 4 ) • Unsupervised patients with potential high levels of non - compliance .
( 4 ) • Spinal puncture and other diagnostic or therapeutic procedures with potential for uncontrollable bleeding .
( 4 ) • Hypersensitivity to warfarin or any component of the product .
( 4 ) • Major regional or lumbar block anesthesia .
( 4 ) • Malignant hypertension .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Tissue necrosis : Necrosis or gangrene of skin or other tissues can occur , with severe cases requiring debridement or amputation .
Discontinue warfarin sodium and consider alternative anticoagulants if necessary .
( 5 . 2 ) • Calciphylaxis : Fatal and serious cases have occurred .
Discontinue warfarin sodium and consider alternative anticoagulation therapy .
( 5 . 3 ) • Acute kidney injury may occur during episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria .
( 5 . 4 ) • Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli : Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death .
Discontinue warfarin sodium if such emboli occur .
( 5 . 5 ) • Heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) : Initial therapy with warfarin sodium in HIT has resulted in cases of amputation and death .
Warfarin sodium may be considered after platelet count has normalized .
( 5 . 6 ) • Pregnant women with mechanical heart valves : Warfarin sodium may cause fetal harm ; however , the benefits may outweigh the risks .
( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Hemorrhage Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding .
Bleeding is more likely to occur within the first month .
Risk factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation ( INR > 4 . 0 ) , age greater than or equal to 65 , history of highly variable INRs , history of gastrointestinal bleeding , hypertension , cerebrovascular disease , anemia , malignancy , trauma , renal impairment , certain genetic factors [ seeClinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 5 ) ] , certain concomitant drugs [ seeDrug Interactions ( 7 ) ] , and long duration of warfarin therapy .
Perform regular monitoring of INR in all treated patients .
Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring , careful dose adjustment to desired INR , and a shortest duration of therapy appropriate for the clinical condition .
However , maintenance of INR in the therapeutic range does not eliminate the risk of bleeding .
Drugs , dietary changes , and other factors affect INR levels achieved with warfarin sodium therapy .
Perform more frequent INR monitoring when starting or stopping other drugs , including botanicals , or when changing dosages of other drugs [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Instruct patients about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding [ seePatient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ] .
5 . 2 Tissue Necrosis Warfarin sodium can cause necrosis and / or gangrene of skin and other tissues , which is an uncommon but serious risk ( < 0 . 1 % ) .
Necrosis may be associated with local thrombosis and usually appears within a few days of the start of warfarin sodium therapy .
In severe cases of necrosis , treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue , limb , breast , or penis has been reported .
Careful clinical evaluation is required to determine whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease .
Although various treatments have been attempted , no treatment for necrosis has been considered uniformly effective .
Discontinue warfarin sodium therapy if necrosis occurs .
Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary .
5 . 3 Calciphylaxis Warfarin sodium can cause fatal and serious calciphylaxis or calcium uremic arteriolopathy , which has been reported in patients with and without end - stage renal disease .
When calciphylaxis is diagnosed in these patients , discontinue Warfarin sodium and treat calciphylaxis as appropriate .
Consider alternative anticoagulation therapy .
5 . 4 Acute Kidney Injury In patients with altered glomerular integrity or with a history of kidney disease , acute kidney injury may occur with Warfarin sodium , possibly in relation to episodes of excessive anticoagulation and hematuria [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
More frequent monitoring of anticoagulation is advised in patients with compromised renal function .
5 . 5 Systemic Atheroemboli and Cholesterol Microemboli Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin sodium may enhance the release of atheromatous plaque emboli .
Systemic atheroemboli and cholesterol microemboli can present with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the site of embolization .
The most commonly involved visceral organs are the kidneys followed by the pancreas , spleen , and liver .
Some cases have progressed to necrosis or death .
A distinct syndrome resulting from microemboli to the feet is known as “ purple toes syndrome . ”
Discontinue warfarin sodium therapy if such phenomena are observed .
Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary .
5 . 6 Limb Ischemia , Necrosis , and Gangrene in Patients with HIT and HITTS Do not use warfarin sodium as initial therapy in patients with heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) and with heparin - induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis syndrome ( HITTS ) .
Cases of limb ischemia , necrosis , and gangrene have occurred in patients with HIT and HITTS when heparin treatment was discontinued and warfarin therapy was started or continued .
In some patients , sequelae have included amputation of the involved area and / or death .
Treatment with warfarin sodium may be considered after the platelet count has normalized .
5 . 7 Use in Pregnant Women with Mechanical Heart Valves Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
While warfarin sodium is contraindicated during pregnancy , the potential benefits of using warfarin sodium may outweigh the risks for pregnant women with mechanical heart valves at high risk of thromboembolism .
In those individual situations , the decision to initiate or continue warfarin sodium should be reviewed with the patient , taking into consideration the specific risks and benefits pertaining to the individual patient ’ s medical situation , as well as the most current medical guidelines .
Warfarin sodium exposure during pregnancy causes a recognized pattern of major congenital malformations ( warfarin embryopathy and fetotoxicity ) , fatal fetal hemorrhage , and an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and fetal mortality .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus [ seeUse in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 8 Other Clinical Settings with Increased Risks In the following clinical settings , the risks of warfarin sodium therapy may be increased : • Moderate to severe hepatic impairment • Infectious diseases or disturbances of intestinal flora ( e . g . , sprue , antibiotic therapy ) • Use of an indwelling catheter • Severe to moderate hypertension • Deficiency in protein C - mediated anticoagulant response : Warfarin sodium reduces the synthesis of the naturally occurring anticoagulants , protein C and protein S . Hereditary or acquired deficiencies of protein C or its cofactor , protein S , have been associated with tissue necrosis following warfarin administration .
Concomitant anticoagulation therapy with heparin for 5 to 7 days during initiation of therapy with warfarin sodium may minimize the incidence of tissue necrosis in these patients .
• Eye surgery : In cataract surgery , warfarin sodium use was associated with a significant increase in minor complications of sharp needle and local anesthesia block but not associated with potentially sight - threatening operative hemorrhagic complications .
As warfarin sodium cessation or reduction may lead to serious thromboembolic complications , the decision to discontinue warfarin sodium before a relatively less invasive and complex eye surgery , such as lens surgery , should be based upon the risks of anticoagulant therapy weighed against the benefits .
• Polycythemia vera • Vasculitis • Diabetes mellitus 5 . 9 Endogenous Factors Affecting INR The following factors may be responsible for increased INR response : diarrhea , hepatic disorders , poor nutritional state , steatorrhea , or vitamin K deficiency .
The following factors may be responsible for decreased INR response : increased vitamin K intake or hereditary warfarin resistance .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions to warfarin sodium are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling : • Hemorrhage [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Overdosage ( 10 ) ] • Tissue Necrosis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Calciphylaxis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Acute Kidney Injury [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Systemic Atheroemboli and Cholesterol Microemboli [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Limb Ischemia , Necrosis , and Gangrene in Patients with HIT and HITTS [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Other Clinical Settings with Increased Risks [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] Other adverse reactions to warfarin sodium include : • Immune system disorders : hypersensitivity / allergic reactions ( including urticaria and anaphylactic reactions ) • Vascular disorders : vasculitis • Hepatobiliary disorders : hepatitis , elevated liver enzymes .
Cholestatic hepatitis has been associated with concomitant administration of warfarin sodium and ticlopidine .
• Gastrointestinal disorders : nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , taste perversion , abdominal pain , flatulence , bloating • Skin disorders : rash , dermatitis ( including bullous eruptions ) , pruritus , alopecia • Respiratory disorders : tracheal or tracheobronchial calcification • General disorders : chills Most common adverse reactions to warfarin sodium are fatal and nonfatal hemorrhage from any tissue or organ .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Concomitant use of drugs that increase bleeding risk , antibiotics , antifungals , botanical ( herbal ) products , and inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C9 , 1A2 , or 3A4 .
( 7 ) • Consult labeling of all concurrently used drugs for complete information about interactions with warfarin sodium or increased risks for bleeding .
( 7 ) 7 . 1 General Information Drugs may interact with warfarin sodium through pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic mechanisms .
Pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are synergism ( impaired hemostasis , reduced clotting factor synthesis ) , competitive antagonism ( vitamin K ) , and alteration of the physiologic control loop for vitamin K metabolism ( hereditary resistance ) .
Pharmacokinetic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are mainly enzyme induction , enzyme inhibition , and reduced plasma protein binding .
It is important to note that some drugs may interact by more than one mechanism .
More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping other drugs , including botanicals , or when changing dosages of other drugs , including drugs intended for short - term use ( e . g . , antibiotics , antifungals , corticosteroids ) [ see Boxed Warning ] .
Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with warfarin sodium or adverse reactions pertaining to bleeding .
7 . 2 CYP450 Interactions CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9 , 2C19 , 2C8 , 2C18 , 1A2 , and 3A4 .
The more potent warfarin S - enantiomer is metabolized by CYP2C9 while the R - enantiomer is metabolized by CYP1A2 and 3A4 .
• Inhibitors of CYP2C9 , 1A2 , and / or 3A4 have the potential to increase the effect ( increase INR ) of warfarin by increasing the exposure of warfarin .
• Inducers of CYP2C9 , 1A2 , and / or 3A4 have the potential to decrease the effect ( decrease INR ) of warfarin by decreasing the exposure of warfarin .
Examples of inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C9 , 1A2 , and 3A4 are below in Table 2 ; however , this list should not be considered all - inclusive .
Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about CYP450 interaction potential .
The CYP450 inhibition and induction potential should be considered when starting , stopping , or changing dose of concomitant medications .
Closely monitor INR if a concomitant drug is a CYP2C9 , 1A2 , and / or 3A4 inhibitor or inducer .

Because bleeding risk is increased when these drugs are used concomitantly with warfarin , closely monitor patients receiving any such drug with warfarin .
Table 3 : Drugs that Can Increase the Risk of Bleeding Drug Class Specific Drugs Anticoagulants argatroban , dabigatran , bivalirudin , desirudin , heparin , lepirudin Antiplatelet Agents aspirin , cilostazol , clopidogrel , dipyridamole , prasugrel , ticlopidine Nonsteroidal Anti - Inflammatory Agents celecoxib , diclofenac , diflunisal , fenoprofen , ibuprofen , indomethacin , ketoprofen , ketorolac , mefenamic acid , naproxen , oxaprozin , piroxicam , sulindac Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors citalopram , desvenlafaxine , duloxetine , escitalopram , fluoxetine , fluvoxamine , milnacipran , paroxetine , sertraline , venlafaxine , vilazodone 7 . 4 Antibiotics and Antifungals There have been reports of changes in INR in patients taking warfarin and antibiotics or antifungals , but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of these agents on plasma concentrations of warfarin .
Closely monitor INR when starting or stopping any antibiotic or antifungal in patients taking warfarin .
7 . 5 Botanical ( Herbal ) Products and Foods More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping botanicals .
Few adequate , well - controlled studies evaluating the potential for metabolic and / or pharmacologic interactions between botanicals and warfarin sodium exist .
Due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with botanical medicinal preparations , the amount of active ingredients may vary .
This could further confound the ability to assess potential interactions and effects on anticoagulation .
Some botanicals may cause bleeding events when taken alone ( e . g . , garlic and Ginkgo biloba ) and may have anticoagulant , antiplatelet , and / or fibrinolytic properties .
These effects would be expected to be additive to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin sodium .
Conversely , some botanicals may decrease the effects of warfarin sodium ( e . g . , co - enzyme Q 10 , St . John ’ s wort , ginseng ) .
Some botanicals and foods can interact with warfarin sodium through CYP450 interactions ( e . g . , echinacea , grapefruit juice , ginkgo , goldenseal , St . John ’ s wort ) .
The amount of vitamin K in food may affect therapy with warfarin sodium .
Advise patients taking warfarin sodium to eat a normal , balanced diet maintaining a consistent amount of vitamin K . Patients taking warfarin sodium should avoid drastic changes in dietary habits , such as eating large amounts of green leafy vegetables .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnant women with mechanical heart valves : warfarin sodium may cause fetal harm ; however , the benefits may outweigh the risks .
( 8 . 1 ) • Lactation : Monitor breastfeeding infants for bruising or bleeding .
( 8 . 2 ) • Renal Impairment : Instruct patients with renal impairment to frequently monitor their INR .
( 8 . 6 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Warfarin sodium is contraindicated in women who are pregnant except in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves , who are at high risk of thromboembolism , and for whom the benefits of warfarin sodium may outweigh the risks [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm .
Exposure to warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy caused a pattern of congenital malformations in about 5 % of exposed offspring .
Because these data were not collected in adequate and well - controlled studies , this incidence of major birth defects is not an adequate basis for comparison to the estimated incidences in the control group or the U . S . general population and may not reflect the incidences observed in practice .
Consider the benefits and risks of warfarin sodium and possible risks to the fetus when prescribing warfarin sodium to a pregnant woman .
Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Fetal / Neonatal Adverse Reactions In humans , warfarin crosses the placenta , and concentrations in fetal plasma approach the maternal values .
Exposure to warfarin during the first trimester of pregnancy caused a pattern of congenital malformations in about 5 % of exposed offspring .
Warfarin embryopathy is characterized by nasal hypoplasia with or without stippled epiphyses ( chondrodysplasia punctata ) and growth retardation ( including low birth weight ) .
Central nervous system and eye abnormalities have also been reported , including dorsal midline dysplasia characterized by agenesis of the corpus callosum , Dandy - Walker malformation , midline cerebellar atrophy , and ventral midline dysplasia characterized by optic atrophy .
Mental retardation , blindness , schizencephaly , microcephaly , hydrocephalus , and other adverse pregnancy outcomes have been reported following warfarin exposure during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Warfarin was not present in human milk from mothers treated with warfarin from a limited published study .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions , including bleeding in a breastfed infant , consider the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding along with the mother ’ s clinical need for warfarin sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from warfarin sodium or from the underlying maternal condition before prescribing warfarin sodium to a lactating woman .
Clinical Considerations Monitor breastfeeding infants for bruising or bleeding .
Data Human Data Based on published data in 15 nursing mothers , warfarin was not detected in human milk .
Among the 15 full - term newborns , 6 nursing infants had documented prothrombin times within the expected range .
Prothrombin times were not obtained for the other 9 nursing infants .
Effects in premature infants have not been evaluated .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Warfarin sodium can cause fetal harm [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating warfarin sodium therapy .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 1 month after the final dose of warfarin sodium .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Adequate and well - controlled studies with warfarin sodium have not been conducted in any pediatric population , and the optimum dosing , safety , and efficacy in pediatric patients is unknown .
Pediatric use of warfarin sodium is based on adult data and recommendations , and available limited pediatric data from observational studies and patient registries .
Pediatric patients administered warfarin sodium should avoid any activity or sport that may result in traumatic injury .
The developing hemostatic system in infants and children results in a changing physiology of thrombosis and response to anticoagulants .
Dosing of warfarin in the pediatric population varies by patient age , with infants generally having the highest , and adolescents having the lowest milligram per kilogram dose requirements to maintain target INRs .
Because of changing warfarin requirements due to age , concomitant medications , diet , and existing medical condition , target INR ranges may be difficult to achieve and maintain in pediatric patients , and more frequent INR determinations are recommended .
Bleeding rates varied by patient population and clinical care center in pediatric observational studies and patient registries .
Infants and children receiving vitamin K - supplemented nutrition , including infant formulas , may be resistant to warfarin therapy , while human milk - fed infants may be sensitive to warfarin therapy .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients receiving warfarin sodium in controlled clinical trials for which data were available for analysis , 1885 patients ( 24 . 4 % ) were 65 years and older , while 185 patients ( 2 . 4 % ) were 75 years and older .
No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
Patients 60 years or older appear to exhibit greater than expected INR response to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin [ seeClinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Warfarin sodium is contraindicated in any unsupervised patient with senility .
Conduct more frequent monitoring for bleeding with administration of warfarin sodium to elderly patients in any situation or with any physical condition where added risk of hemorrhage is present .
Consider lower initiation and maintenance doses of warfarin sodium in elderly patients [ seeDosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Renal clearance is considered to be a minor determinant of anticoagulant response to warfarin .
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment .
Instruct patients with renal impairment taking warfarin to monitor their INR more frequently [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Hepatic impairment can potentiate the response to warfarin through impaired synthesis of clotting factors and decreased metabolism of warfarin .
Conduct more frequent monitoring for bleeding when using warfarin sodium in these patients .
10 OVERDOSAGE 10 . 1 Signs and Symptoms Bleeding ( e . g . , appearance of blood in stools or urine , hematuria , excessive menstrual bleeding , melena , petechiae , excessive bruising or persistent oozing from superficial injuries , unexplained fall in hemoglobin ) is a manifestation of excessive anticoagulation .
10 . 2 Treatment The treatment of excessive anticoagulation is based on the level of the INR , the presence or absence of bleeding , and clinical circumstances .
Reversal of warfarin sodium anticoagulation may be obtained by discontinuing warfarin sodium therapy and , if necessary , by administration of oral or parenteral vitamin K 1 .
The use of vitamin K 1 reduces response to subsequent warfarin sodium therapy and patients may return to a pretreatment thrombotic status following the rapid reversal of a prolonged INR .
Resumption of warfarin sodium administration reverses the effect of vitamin K , and a therapeutic INR can again be obtained by careful dosage adjustment .
If rapid re - anticoagulation is indicated , heparin may be preferable for initial therapy .
Prothrombin complex concentrate ( PCC ) , fresh frozen plasma , or activated Factor VII treatment may be considered if the requirement to reverse the effects of warfarin sodium is urgent .
A risk of hepatitis and other viral diseases is associated with the use of blood products ; PCC and activated Factor VII are also associated with an increased risk of thrombosis .
Therefore , these preparations should be used only in exceptional or life - threatening bleeding episodes secondary to warfarin sodium overdosage .
11 DESCRIPTION Warfarin sodium , USP is an anticoagulant that acts by inhibiting vitamin K - dependent coagulation factors .
The chemical name of warfarin sodium is 3 - ( α - acetonylbenzyl ) - 4 - hydroxycoumarin sodium salt , which is a racemic mixture of the R - and S - enantiomers .
Crystalline warfarin sodium is an isopropanol clathrate .
Its empirical formula is C19H15NaO4 , and its structural formula is represented by the following : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Crystalline warfarin sodium occurs as a white , odorless , crystalline powder that is discolored by light .
It is very soluble in water , freely soluble in alcohol , and very slightly soluble in chloroform and ether .
Each warfarin sodium tablet , USP intended for oral administration contains warfarin sodium clathrates equivalent to 1 mg or 2 mg or 2 . 5 mg or 3 mg or 4 mg or 5 mg or 6 mg or 7 . 5 mg or 10 mg of warfarin sodium .
In addition each tablet contains the inactive ingredients lactose monohydrate , starch , pregelatinised starch , hydroxypropyl cellulose , starlac and magnesium stearate .
Additionally each 1 mg tablet contains : D & C Red # 30 aluminum lake 2 mg tablet contains : FD & C Red # 40 aluminum lake and FD & C Blue # 2 2 . 5 mg tablet contains : D & C Yellow # 10 aluminum lake and FD & C Blue # 2 3 mg tablet contains : FD & C Yellow # 6 aluminum lake , FD & C Blue # 2 and FD & C Red # 40 aluminum lake 4 mg tablet contains : FD & C Blue # 2 5 mg tablet contains : FD & C Yellow # 6 aluminum lake 6 mg tablet contains : FD & C Yellow # 6 aluminum lake and FD & C Blue # 2 7 . 5 mg tablet contains : D & C Yellow # 10 aluminum lake and FD & C Yellow # 6 aluminum lake 10 mg tablet is dye free [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Warfarin acts by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K - dependent clotting factors , which include Factors II , VII , IX , and X , and the anticoagulant proteins C and S . Vitamin K is an essential cofactor for the post ribosomal synthesis of the vitamin K - dependent clotting factors .
Vitamin K promotes the biosynthesis of γ - carboxyglutamic acid residues in the proteins that are essential for biological activity .
Warfarin is thought to interfere with clotting factor synthesis by inhibition of the C1 subunit of vitamin K epoxide reductase ( VKORC1 ) enzyme complex , thereby reducing the regeneration of vitamin K 1 epoxide [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 5 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics An anticoagulation effect generally occurs within 24 hours after warfarin administration .
However , peak anticoagulant effect may be delayed 72 to 96 hours .
The duration of action of a single dose of racemic warfarin is 2 to 5 days .
The effects of warfarin sodium may become more pronounced as effects of daily maintenance doses overlap .
This is consistent with the half - lives of the affected vitamin K - dependent clotting factors and anticoagulation proteins : Factor II - 60 hours , VII - 4 to 6 hours , IX - 24 hours , X - 48 to 72 hours , and proteins C and S are approximately 8 hours and 30 hours , respectively .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Warfarin sodium is a racemic mixture of the R - and S - enantiomers of warfarin .
The S - enantiomer exhibits 2 to 5 times more anticoagulant activity than the R - enantiomer in humans , but generally has a more rapid clearance .
Absorption Warfarin is essentially completely absorbed after oral administration , with peak concentration generally attained within the first 4 hours .
Distribution Warfarin shows a volume of distribution of about 0 . 14 L / kg .
Approximately 99 % of the drug is bound to plasma proteins .
Metabolism The elimination of warfarin is almost entirely by metabolism .
Warfarin is stereoselectively metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P - 450 ( CYP450 ) microsomal enzymes to inactive hydroxylated metabolites ( predominant route ) and by reductases to reduced metabolites ( warfarin alcohols ) with minimal anticoagulant activity .
Identified metabolites of warfarin include dehydrowarfarin , two diastereoisomer alcohols , and 4 ′ - , 6 - , 7 - , 8 - , and 10 - hydroxywarfarin .
The CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9 , 2C19 , 2C8 , 2C18 , 1A2 , and 3A4 .
CYP2C9 , a polymorphic enzyme , is likely to be the principal form of human liver CYP450 that modulates the in vivo anticoagulant activity of warfarin .
Patients with one or more variant CYP2C9 alleles have decreased S - warfarin clearance [ seeClinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 5 ) ] .
Excretion The terminal half - life of warfarin after a single dose is approximately one week ; however , the effective half - life ranges from 20 to 60 hours , with a mean of about 40 hours .
The clearance of R - warfarin is generally half that of S - warfarin , thus as the volumes of distribution are similar , the half - life of R - warfarin is longer than that of S - warfarin .
The half - life of R - warfarin ranges from 37 to 89 hours , while that of S - warfarin ranges from 21 to 43 hours .
Studies with radio labeled drug have demonstrated that up to 92 % of the orally administered dose is recovered in urine .
Very little warfarin is excreted unchanged in urine .
Urinary excretion is in the form of metabolites .
Geriatric Patients Patients 60 years or older appear to exhibit greater than expected INR response to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin .
The cause of the increased sensitivity to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin in this age group is unknown but may be due to a combination of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors .
Limited information suggests there is no difference in the clearance of S - warfarin ; however , there may be a slight decrease in the clearance of R - warfarin in the elderly as compared to the young .
Therefore , as patient age increases , a lower dose of warfarin is usually required to produce a therapeutic level of anticoagulation [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 , 2 . 4 ) ] .
Asian Patients Asian patients may require lower initiation and maintenance doses of warfarin .
A non - controlled study of 151 Chinese outpatients stabilized on warfarin for various indications reported a mean daily warfarin requirement of 3 . 3 ± 1 . 4 mg to achieve an INR of 2 to 2 . 5 .
Patient age was the most important determinant of warfarin requirement in these patients , with a progressively lower warfarin requirement with increasing age .
12 . 5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 and VKORC1 Polymorphisms The S - enantiomer of warfarin is mainly metabolized to 7 - hydroxywarfarin by CYP2C9 , a polymorphic enzyme .
The variant alleles , CYP2C9 * 2 and CYP2C9 * 3 , result in decreased in vitro CYP2C9 enzymatic 7 - hydroxylation of S - warfarin .
The frequencies of these alleles in Caucasians are approximately 11 % and 7 % for CYP2C9 * 2 and CYP2C9 * 3 , respectively .
Other CYP2C9 alleles associated with reduced enzymatic activity occur at lower frequencies , including * 5 , * 6 , and * 11 alleles in populations of African ancestry and * 5 , * 9 , and * 11 alleles in Caucasians .
Warfarin reduces the regeneration of vitamin K from vitamin K epoxide in the vitamin K cycle through inhibition of VKOR , a multiprotein enzyme complex .
Certain single nucleotide polymorphisms in the VKORC1 gene ( e . g . , – 1639 G > A ) have been associated with variable warfarin dose requirements .
VKORC1 and CYP2C9 gene variants generally explain the largest proportion of known variability in warfarin dose requirements .
CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype information , when available , can assist in selection of the initial dose of warfarin [ seeDosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity , mutagenicity , or fertility studies have not been performed with warfarin .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Atrial Fibrillation In five prospective , randomized , controlled clinical trials involving 3711 patients with non - rheumatic AF , warfarin significantly reduced the risk of systemic thromboembolism including stroke ( see Table 4 ) .
The risk reduction ranged from 60 % to 86 % in all except one trial ( CAFA : 45 % ) , which was stopped early due to published positive results from two of these trials .
The incidence of major bleeding in these trials ranged from 0 . 6 % to 2 . 7 % ( see Table 4 ) .

Trials in patients with both AF and mitral stenosis suggest a benefit from anticoagulation with warfarin [ seeDosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
14 . 2 Mechanical and Bioprosthetic Heart Valves In a prospective , randomized , open - label , positive - controlled study in 254 patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves , the thromboembolic - free interval was found to be significantly greater in patients treated with warfarin alone compared with dipyridamole / aspirin - treated patients ( p < 0 . 005 ) and pentoxifylline / aspirin - treated patients ( p < 0 . 05 ) .
The results of this study are presented in Table 5 .
Table 5 : Prospective , Randomized , Open - Label , Positive - Controlled Clinical Study of Warfarin in Patients with Mechanical Prosthetic Heart Valves Patients Treated With Event Warfarin Dipyridamole / Aspirin Pentoxifylline / Aspirin Thromboembolism 2 . 2 / 100 py 8 . 6 / 100 py 7 . 9 / 100 py Major Bleeding 2 . 5 / 100 py 0 . 0 / 100 py 0 . 9 / 100 py py = patient years In a prospective , open - label , clinical study comparing moderate ( INR 2 . 65 ) vs . high intensity ( INR 9 . 0 ) warfarin therapies in 258 patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves , thromboembolism occurred with similar frequency in the two groups ( 4 . 0 and 3 . 7 events per 100 patient years , respectively ) .
Major bleeding was more common in the high intensity group .
The results of this study are presented in Table 6 .

Major hemorrhages occurred in 4 . 6 % of patients in the higher intensity INR group compared to zero in the lower intensity INR group .
14 . 3 Myocardial Infarction WARIS ( The Warfarin Re - Infarction Study ) was a double - blind , randomized study of 1214 patients 2 to 4 weeks post - infarction treated with warfarin to a target INR of 2 . 8 to 4 . 8 .
The primary endpoint was a composite of total mortality and recurrent infarction .
A secondary endpoint of cerebrovascular events was assessed .
Mean follow - up of the patients was 37 months .
The results for each endpoint separately , including an analysis of vascular death , are provided in Table 7 .

Revised : 06 / 2018 MEDICATION GUIDE Warfarin Sodium Tablets , USP ( ( war ' far in soe ' dee um ) What is the most important information I should know about warfarin sodium ?
Warfarin sodium can cause bleeding which can be serious and sometimes lead to death .
This is because warfarin sodium is a blood thinner medicine that lowers the chance of blood clots forming in your body .
You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take warfarin sodium and : • are 65 years of age or older • have a history of stomach or intestinal bleeding • have high blood pressure ( hypertension ) • have a history of stroke , or “ mini - stroke ” ( transient ischemic attack or TIA ) • have serious heart disease • have a low blood count or cancer • have had trauma , such as an accident or surgery • have kidney problems • take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding , including : • a medicine that contains heparin • other medicines to prevent or treat blood clots • nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) • take warfarin sodium for a long time .
Warfarin sodium is the active ingredient in warfarin sodium tablets .
Tell your healthcare provider if you take any of these medicines .
Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above .
Many other medicines can interact with warfarin sodium and affect the dose you need or increase warfarin sodium side effects .
Do not change or stop any of your medicines or start any new medicines before you talk to your healthcare provider .
Do not take other medicines that contain warfarin sodium while taking warfarin sodium tablets .
• Get your regular blood test to check for your response to warfarin sodium .
This blood test is called an INR test .
The INR test checks to see how fast your blood clots .
Your healthcare provider will decide what INR numbers are best for you .
Your dose of warfarin sodium will be adjusted to keep your INR in a target range for you .
• Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following signs or symptoms of bleeding problems : • pain , swelling , or discomfort • headaches , dizziness , or weakness • unusual bruising ( bruises that develop without known cause or grow in size ) • nosebleeds • bleeding gums • bleeding from cuts takes a long time to stop • menstrual bleeding or vaginal bleeding that is heavier than normal • pink or brown urine • red or black stools • coughing up blood • vomiting blood or material that looks like coffee grounds • Some foods and beverages can interact with warfarin sodium and affect your treatment and dose .
• Eat a normal , balanced diet .
Talk to your healthcare provider before you make any diet changes .
Do not eat large amounts of leafy , green vegetables .
Leafy , green vegetables contain vitamin K . Certain vegetable oils also contain large amounts of vitamin K . Too much vitamin K can lower the effect of warfarin sodium .
• Always tell all of your healthcare providers that you take warfarin sodium .
• Wear or carry information that you take warfarin sodium .
See “ What are the possible side effects of warfarin sodium ? ”
for more information about side effects .
What is warfarin sodium ?
