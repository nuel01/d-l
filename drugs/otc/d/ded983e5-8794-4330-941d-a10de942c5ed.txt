DESCRIPTION Oxybutynin chloride is an antispasmodic , anticholinergic agent .
Each Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablet contains 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP , formulated as a once - a - day controlled - release tablet for oral administration .
Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R - and S - enantiomers .
Chemically , oxybutynin chloride is d , l ( racemic ) 4 - diethylamino - 2 - butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride .
The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C 22 H 31 NO 3 • HCl .
Its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393 . 9 .
It is readily soluble in water and acids , but relatively insoluble in alkalis .
Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets also contain the following inert ingredients : cellulose acetate , hypromellose , lactose , magnesium stearate , polyethylene glycol , polyethylene oxide , synthetic iron oxides , titanium dioxide , polysorbate 80 , sodium chloride , and butylated hydroxytoluene .
System Components and PerformanceOxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets use osmotic pressure to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours .
The system , which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance , comprises an osmotically active bilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane .
The bilayer core is composed of a drug layer containing the drug and excipients , and a push layer containing osmotically active components .
There is a precision - laser drilled orifice in the semipermeable membrane on the drug - layer side of the tablet .
In an aqueous environment , such as the gastrointestinal tract , water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core , causing the drug to go into suspension and the push layer to expand .
This expansion pushes the suspended drug out through the orifice .
The semipermeable membrane controls the rate at which water permeates into the tablet core , which in turn controls the rate of drug delivery .
The controlled rate of drug delivery into the gastrointestinal lumen is thus independent of pH or gastrointestinal motility .
The function of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets depends on the existence of an osmotic gradient between the contents of the bilayer core and the fluid in the gastrointestinal tract .
Since the osmotic gradient remains constant , drug delivery remains essentially constant .
The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the feces as an insoluble shell .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle .
Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one - fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle , but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity .
No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia ( antinicotinic effects ) .
Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle .
In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions , cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder ( vesical ) capacity , diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle , and delays the initial desire to void .
Oxybutynin thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination .
Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R - isomer .
A metabolite , desethyloxybutynin , has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies .
PharmacokineticsAbsorptionFollowing the first dose of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets , oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours ; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours , minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin .
The relative bioavailabilities of R - and S - oxybutynin from Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets are 156 % and 187 % , respectively , compared with oxybutynin .
The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R - and S - oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1 .
The plasma concentration - time profiles for R - and S - oxybutynin are similar in shape ; Figure 1 shows the profile for R - oxybutynin .

Food EffectsThe rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions .
DistributionPlasma concentrations of oxybutynin decline biexponentially following intravenous or oral administration .
The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride .
MetabolismOxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems , particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall .
Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid , which is pharmacologically inactive , and desethyloxybutynin , which is pharmacologically active .
Following Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablet administration , plasma concentrations of R - and S - desethyloxybutynin are 73 % and 92 % , respectively , of concentrations observed with oxybutynin .
ExcretionOxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver , with less than 0 . 1 % of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine .
Also , less than 0 . 1 % of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin .
Dose ProportionalityPharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin ( C max and AUC ) following administration of 5 – 20 mg of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets are dose proportional .

Drug - Drug InteractionsSee PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL STUDIES Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence , urgency , and frequency in three controlled studies and one open label study .
The majority of patients were Caucasian ( 89 . 0 % ) and female ( 91 . 9 % ) with a mean age of 59 years ( range , 18 to 98 years ) .
Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence ( with a predominance of urge ) as evidenced by ≥ 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and ≥ 10 micturitions per day .
Study 1 was a fixed dose escalation design , whereas the other studies used a dose adjustment design in which each patient ' s final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects .
Controlled studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications , and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks .
The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following tables and figures .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] INDICATIONS AND USAGE Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets are a once - daily controlled - release tablet indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence , urgency , and frequency .
Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets are also indicated in the treatment of pediatric patients aged 6 years and older with symptoms of detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition ( e . g . , spina bifida ) .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets are contraindicated in patients with urinary retention , gastric retention and other severe decreased gastrointestinal motility conditions , uncontrolled narrow - angle glaucoma and in patients who are at risk for these conditions .
Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets are also contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug substance or other components of the product .
PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System EffectsOxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system ( CNS ) effects ( See ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported , including hallucinations , agitation , confusion and somnolence .
Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects , particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose .
If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects , dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered .
Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms .
GeneralOxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets should be used with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment and in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of symptom aggravation .
Urinary RetentionOxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Gastrointestinal DisordersOxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets , like other anticholinergic drugs , may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony .
Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and / or who are concurrently taking drugs ( such as bisphosphonates ) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis .
As with any other nondeformable material , caution should be used when administering Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing ( pathologic or iatrogenic ) .
There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled - release formulations .
Information for PatientsPatients should be informed that heat prostration ( fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating ) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature .
Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness ( somnolence ) or blurred vision , patients should be advised to exercise caution .
Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin .
Patients should be informed that Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets should be swallowed whole with the aid of liquids .
Patients should not chew , divide , or crush tablets .
The medication is contained within a nonabsorbable shell designed to release the drug at a controlled rate .
The tablet shell is eliminated from the body ; patients should not be concerned if they occasionally notice in their stool something that looks like a tablet .
Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets should be taken at approximately the same time each day .
Drug InteractionsThe concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth , constipation , somnolence ( drowsiness ) , and / or other anticholinergic - like effects may increase the frequency and / or severity of such effects .
Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility .
This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index .
Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets were administered with ketoconazole , a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor .
Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system , such as antimycotic agents ( e . g . , itraconazole and miconazole ) or macrolide antibiotics ( e . g . , erythromycin and clarithromycin ) , may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters ( i . e . , C max and AUC ) .
The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known .
Caution should be used when such drugs are co - administered .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of FertilityA 24 - month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20 , 80 , and 160 mg / kg / day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity .
These doses are approximately 6 , 25 , and 50 times the maximum human exposure , based on surface area .
Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and Salmonella typhimurium test systems .
Reproduction studies with oxybutynin chloride in the mouse , rat , hamster , and rabbit showed no definite evidence of impaired fertility .
PregnancyTeratogenic EffectsPregnancy Category BReproduction studies with oxybutynin chloride in the mouse , rat , hamster , and rabbit showed no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus .
The safety of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablet administration to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established .
Therefore , Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets should not be given to pregnant women unless , in the judgment of the physician , the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards .
Nursing MothersIt is not known whether oxybutynin is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets are administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric UseThe safety and efficacy of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets were studied in 60 children in a 24 - week , open - label trial .
Patients were aged 6 – 15 years , all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition ( e . g . , spina bifida ) , all used clean intermittent catheterization , and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride .
Study results demonstrated that administration of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets 5 to 20 mg / day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL , an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL , and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34 % to 51 % .
Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results .
Administration of Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL , a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H 2 O to 33 cm H 2 O , and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions ( of at least 15 cm H 2 O ) from 60 % to 28 % .
Oxybutynin Chloride Extended Release Tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients who can not swallow the tablet whole without chewing , dividing , or crushing , or in children under the age of 6 ( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Geriatric UseThe rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics , Special Populations : Geriatric ) .
