• Blood chemistries - liver function tests and TSH .
• Pregnancy - in women of childbearing potential .
• ECG [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
2 . 5 Dose Modifications If severe adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities develop during ribavirin combination therapy , modify or discontinue the dose until the adverse reaction abates or decreases in severity ( see Table 4 ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ] .
If intolerance persists after dose adjustment , combination therapy should be discontinued .
Refer to PegIntron labeling for additional information regarding dose reduction of PegIntron .
Dose reduction in pediatric patients is accomplished by modifying the recommended ribavirin dose from the original starting dose of 15 mg / kg daily in a two - step process to 12 mg / kg / day , then to 8 mg / kg / day , if needed ( see Table 4 ) .
Ribavirin is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL / min [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Patients with impaired renal function and those over the age of 50 should be carefully monitored with respect to development of anemia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Ribavirin should be administered with caution to patients with pre - existing cardiac disease .
Assess cardiovascular status before initiation of treatment and during therapy .
If there is any deterioration of cardiovascular status , discontinue combination therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
In patients with a history of stable cardiovascular disease , a permanent dose reduction is required if the hemoglobin decreases by 2 g / dL or more during any 4 - week period .
If the hemoglobin level remains below 12 g / dL after 4 weeks on a reduced dose , discontinue combination therapy .
Modify or discontinue ribavirin dosing in any patient whose hemoglobin level falls below 10 g / dL ( see Table 4 ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Table 4 Guidelines for Dose Modification and Discontinuation of Ribavirin Capsules in combination with PegIntron or INTRON A Based on Laboratory Parameters in Adults and Pediatrics Note 1 : Adult patients : 1 st dose reduction of ribavirin is by 200 mg / day ( except in patients receiving the 1 , 400 mg , dose reduction should be by 400 mg / day ) .
If needed , 2 nd dose reduction of ribavirin is by an additional 200 mg / day .
Patients whose dose of ribavirin is reduced to 600 mg daily receive one 200 mg capsule in the morning and two 200 mg capsules in the evening .

2 . 6 Discontinuation of Dosing Adults In HCV genotype 1 , interferon - alfa - naïve patients receiving PegIntron in combination with ribavirin , discontinue therapy if there is not at least a 2 log10 drop or loss of HCV - RNA at 12 weeks of therapy , or if HCV - RNA levels remain detectable after 24 weeks of therapy .
Regardless of genotype , previously treated patients who have detectable HCV - RNA at week 12 or 24 are highly unlikely to achieve SVR and discontinuation of therapy should be considered .
Pediatrics ( 3 to 17 years of age ) In patients receiving PegIntron / ribavirin combination ( excluding HCV Genotype 2 and 3 ) , discontinue therapy at 12 weeks if HCV - RNA has dropped less than 2 log10 compared to pretreatment level , or at 24 weeks if HCV - RNA is still detectable .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Ribavirin capsules : 200 mg ( 3 ) Ribavirin capsules , USP : 200 mg 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS • Pregnancy and men whose female partners are pregnant ( 4 , 5 . 1 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) • Known hypersensitivity reactions such as Stevens Johnson syndrome , toxic , epidermal necrolysis , and erythema multiforme to ribavirin or any component of the product ( 4 ) • Autoimmune hepatitis ( 4 ) • Hemoglobinopathies ( 4 ) • Creatinine clearance less than 50 mL / min ( 4 , 12 . 3 ) • Coadministration with didanosine ( 4 , 7 . 1 ) Ribavirin capsules combination therapy is contraindicated in : • pregnancy .
Ribavirin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Ribavirin is contraindicated in women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant .
If a patient becomes pregnant while taking ribavirin , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .
• men whose female partners are pregnant [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] • patients with known hypersensitivity reactions such as Stevens - Johnson syndrome , toxic , epidermal necrolysis , and erythema multiforme to ribavirin or any component of the product • patients with autoimmune hepatitis • patients with hemoglobinopathies ( e . g . , thalassemia major , sickle - cell anemia ) • patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL / min [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] • when coadministered with didanosine because exposure to the active metabolite of didanosine ( dideoxyadenosine 5 ' - triphosphate ) is increased .
Fatal hepatic failure , as well as peripheral neuropathy , pancreatitis , and symptomatic hyperlactatemia / lactic acidosis , has been reported in patients receiving didanosine in combination with ribavirin [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : May cause fetal harm .
Patients should have a negative pregnancy test prior to therapy and use effective contraception and undergo periodic pregnancy tests .
( 5 . 1 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) Patients exhibiting the following conditions should be closely monitored and may require dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy : • Hemolytic anemia may occur with a significant initial drop in hemoglobin .
( 5 . 2 ) • Pancreatitis .
( 5 . 3 ) • Pulmonary infiltrates or pulmonary function impairment .
( 5 . 4 ) • New or worsening ophthalmologic disorders ( 5 . 5 ) • Severe decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts , and hematologic , endocrine ( e . g . , TSH ) , and hepatic abnormalities .
( 5 . 6 ) • Dental / periodontal disorders reported with combination therapy .
( 5 . 7 ) • Concomitant administration of azathioprine .
( 5 . 8 ) • Weight loss and growth inhibition reported during combination therapy in pediatric patients .
Long - term growth inhibition ( height ) reported in some patients .
( 5 . 9 ) • Monotherapy with ribavirin is not permitted .
( 5 . 10 ) 5 . 1 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Ribavirin capsules and oral solution may cause birth defects , miscarriage or stillbirth .
Ribavirin therapy should not be started until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to planned initiation of therapy .
Patients should use effective contraception and have periodic monitoring with pregnancy tests during treatment and during the 6 - month period after treatment has been stopped .
Extreme care must be taken to avoid pregnancy in female patients and in female partners of male patients .
Ribavirin has demonstrated significant teratogenic and embryocidal effects in all animal species tested .
These effects occurred at doses as low as one twentieth of the recommended human dose of ribavirin [ see Boxed Warning , Contraindications ( 4 ) , and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 2 Anemia Hemolytic anemia was observed in approximately 10 % of ribavirin / INTRON A - treated subjects in clinical trials .
The anemia associated with ribavirin occurs within 1 to 2 weeks of initiation of therapy .
Because the initial drop in hemoglobin may be significant , obtain hemoglobin or hematocrit levels before the start of treatment and at week 2 and week 4 of therapy , or more frequently if clinically indicated .
Patients should then be followed as clinically appropriate [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 , 2 . 6 ) ] .
Fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions have been reported in patients with anemia caused by ribavirin .
Patients should be assessed for underlying cardiac disease before initiation of ribavirin therapy .
Patients with pre - existing cardiac disease should have electrocardiograms administered before treatment and should be appropriately monitored during therapy .
If there is any deterioration of cardiovascular status , therapy should be suspended or discontinued [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 , 2 . 6 ) ] .
Because cardiac disease may be worsened by drug - induced anemia , patients with a history of significant or unstable cardiac disease should not use ribavirin .
5 . 3 Pancreatitis Suspend ribavirin and INTRON A or PegIntron combination therapy in patients with signs and symptoms of pancreatitis and discontinue in patients with confirmed pancreatitis .
5 . 4 Pulmonary Disorders Pulmonary symptoms , including dyspnea , pulmonary infiltrates , pneumonitis , pulmonary hypertension , and pneumonia , have been reported during ribavirin with alpha interferon combination therapy ; occasional cases of fatal pneumonia have occurred .
In addition , sarcoidosis or the exacerbation of sarcoidosis has been reported .
If there is evidence of pulmonary infiltrates or pulmonary function impairment , closely monitor the patient , and if appropriate , discontinue combination therapy .
5 . 5 Ophthalmologic Disorders Ribavirin is used in combination therapy with INTRON A or PegIntron .
Refer to labeling for PegIntron for additional information .
5 . 6 Laboratory Tests PegIntron in combination with ribavirin may cause severe decreases in neutrophil and platelet counts , and hematologic , endocrine ( e . g . , TSH ) , and hepatic abnormalities .
Obtain hematology and blood chemistry testing in patients on PegIntron / ribavirin combination therapy before the start of treatment and then periodically thereafter .
In the adult clinical trial , complete blood counts ( including hemoglobin , neutrophil , and platelet counts ) and chemistries ( including AST , ALT , bilirubin , and uric acid ) were measured during the treatment period at weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , and then at 6 - week intervals , or more frequently if abnormalities developed .
In pediatric subjects , the same laboratory parameters were evaluated with additional assessment of hemoglobin at treatment week 6 .
TSH levels were measured every 12 weeks during the treatment period .
HCV - RNA should be measured periodically during treatment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
5 . 7 Dental and Periodontal Disorders Dental and periodontal disorders have been reported in patients receiving ribavirin and interferon or peginterferon combination therapy .
In addition , dry mouth could have a damaging effect on teeth and mucous membranes of the mouth during long - term treatment with the combination of ribavirin and pegylated or nonpegylated interferon alfa - 2 b .
Advise patients to brush their teeth thoroughly twice daily and have regular dental examinations .
If vomiting occurs , advise patients to rinse out their mouth thoroughly afterwards .
5 . 8 Concomitant Administration of Azathioprine Pancytopenia ( marked decreases in red blood cells , neutrophils , and platelets ) and bone marrow suppression have been reported in the literature to occur within 3 to 7 weeks after the concomitant administration of pegylated interferon / ribavirin and azathioprine .
In this limited number of patients ( n = 8 ) , myelotoxicity was reversible within 4 to 6 weeks upon withdrawal of both HCV antiviral therapy and concomitant azathioprine and did not recur upon reintroduction of either treatment alone .
Discontinue PegIntron , ribavirin , and azathioprine for pancytopenia , and do not reintroduce pegylated interferon / ribavirin with concomitant azathioprine [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 9 Impact on Growth in Pediatric Patients Data on the effects of PegIntron and ribavirin on growth come from an open - label study in subjects 3 through 17 years of age , in which weight and height changes were compared to US normative population data .
In general , the weight and height gain of pediatric subjects treated with PegIntron and ribavirin lagged behind that predicted by normative population data for the entire length of treatment .
Severely inhibited growth velocity ( less than 3 rd percentile ) was observed in 70 % of the subjects while on treatment .
Following treatment , rebound growth and weight gain occurred in most subjects .
Long - term follow - up data in pediatric subjects , however , indicates that PegIntron in combination therapy with ribavirin may induce a growth inhibition that results in reduced adult height in some patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Similarly , an impact on growth was seen in subjects after treatment with ribavirin and INTRON A combination therapy for one year .
In a long - term follow - up trial of a limited number of these subjects , combination therapy resulted in reduced final adult height in some subjects [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 10 Not Recommended for Monotherapy and Risks Associated with Combination Therapy Based on results of clinical trials , ribavirin monotherapy is not effective for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection ; therefore , ribavirin capsules must not be used alone .
The safety and efficacy of ribavirin capsules have only been established when used together with INTRON A or PegIntron ( not other interferons ) as combination therapy .
The safety and efficacy of ribavirin with INTRON A or PegIntron combination therapy for the treatment of HIV infection , adenovirus , RSV , parainfluenza , or influenza infections have not been established .
Ribavirin capsules should not be used for these indications .
There are significant adverse reactions caused by ribavirin / INTRON A or PegIntron combination therapy , including severe depression and suicidal or homicidal ideation , hemolytic anemia , suppression of bone marrow function , autoimmune and infectious disorders , pulmonary dysfunction , pancreatitis , and diabetes .
Suicidal ideation or attempts occurred more frequently among pediatric patients , primarily adolescents , compared to adult patients ( 2 . 4 % versus 1 % ) during treatment and off - therapy follow - up .
Labeling for INTRON A and PegIntron should be reviewed in their entirety for additional safety information prior to initiation of combination treatment .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Hemolytic anemia occurred in more than 10 % of adult patients receiving ribavirin / PegIntron or INTRON A combination therapy .
( 6 . 1 ) Most common adverse reactions ( 40 % or greater ) in adult patients receiving ribavirin / PegIntron or INTRON A combination therapy are injection site reaction , fatigue / asthenia , headache , rigors , fevers , nausea , myalgia and anxiety / emotional lability / irritability .

In Study 2 , the incidence of serious adverse reactions was 17 % in the PegIntron / ribavirin groups compared to 14 % in the INTRON A / ribavirin group .
In Study 3 , there was a similar incidence of serious adverse reactions reported for the weight - based ribavirin group ( 12 % ) and for the flat - dose ribavirin regimen .
In many but not all cases , adverse reactions resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy .
Some subjects experienced ongoing or new serious adverse reactions during the 6 - month follow - up period .
In Study 2 , many subjects continued to experience adverse reactions several months after discontinuation of therapy .
By the end of the 6 - month follow - up period , the incidence of ongoing adverse reactions by body class in the PegIntron 1 . 5 mcg / ribavirin group was 33 % ( psychiatric ) , 20 % ( musculoskeletal ) , and 10 % ( for endocrine and for GI ) .
In approximately 10 to 15 % of subjects , weight loss , fatigue , and headache had not resolved .
There have been 28 subject deaths that occurred during treatment or follow - up in Studies 2 , 3 , and 4 .
In Study 2 , there was 1 suicide in a subject receiving PegIntron / ribavirin combination therapy ; and 1 subject death in the INTRON A / ribavirin group ( motor vehicle accident ) .
In Study 3 , there were 14 deaths , 2 of which were probable suicides and 1 was an unexplained death in a person with a relevant medical history of depression .
In Study 4 , there were 12 deaths , 6 of which occurred in subjects who received PegIntron / ribavirin combination therapy , 5 in the PegIntron 1 . 5 mcg / ribavirin arm ( N = 1 , 019 ) and 1 in the PegIntron 1 mcg / ribavirin arm ( N = 1 , 016 ) , and 6 of which occurred in subjects receiving Pegasys / Copegus ( N = 1 , 035 ) ; there were 3 suicides that occurred during the off treatment follow - up period in subjects who received PegIntron ( 1 . 5 mcg / kg ) / ribavirin combination therapy .
In Studies 1 and 2 , 10 to 14 % of subjects receiving PegIntron , alone or in combination with ribavirin , discontinued therapy compared with 6 % treated with INTRON A alone and 13 % treated with INTRON A in combination with ribavirin .
In Study 3 , 15 % of subjects receiving PegIntron in combination with weight - based ribavirin and 14 % of subjects receiving PegIntron with flat dose ribavirin discontinued therapy due to an adverse reaction .
The most common reasons for discontinuation were related to known interferon effects of psychiatric , systemic ( e . g . , fatigue , headache ) , or gastrointestinal adverse reactions .
In Study 4 , 13 % of subjects in the PegIntron 1 . 5 mcg / ribavirin arm , 10 % in the PegIntron 1 mcg / ribavirin arm and 13 % in the Pegasys 180 mcg / Copegus arm discontinued due to adverse events .
In Study 2 , dose reductions for ribavirin were similar across all three groups [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] , 33 to 35 % .
The most common reasons for dose modifications were neutropenia ( 18 % ) , or anemia ( 9 % ) ( see Laboratory Values ) .
Other common reasons included depression , fatigue , nausea , and thrombocytopenia .
In Study 3 , dose modifications due to adverse reactions occurred more frequently with weight - based ribavirin dosing compared to flat dosing ( 29 % and 23 % , respectively ) .
In Study 4 , 16 % of subjects had a dose reduction of PegIntron to 1 mcg / kg in combination with ribavirin , with an additional 4 % requiring the second dose reduction of PegIntron to 0 . 5 mcg / kg due to adverse events compared to 15 % of subjects in the Pegasys / Copegus arm , who required a dose reduction to 135 mcg / week with Pegasys , with an additional 7 % in the Pegasys / Copegus arm requiring second dose reduction to 90 mcg / week with Pegasys .
In the PegIntron / ribavirin combination trials the most common adverse reactions were psychiatric , which occurred among 77 % of subjects in Study 2 and 68 % to 69 % of subjects in Study 3 .
These psychiatric adverse reactions included most commonly depression , irritability , and insomnia , each reported by approximately 30 % to 40 % of subjects in all treatment groups .
Suicidal behavior ( ideation , attempts , and suicides ) occurred in 2 % of all subjects during treatment or during follow - up after treatment cessation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 ) ] .
In Study 4 , psychiatric adverse reactions occurred in 58 % of subjects in the PegIntron 1 . 5 mcg / ribavirin arm , 55 % of subjects in the PegIntron 1 mcg / ribavirin arm , and 57 % of subjects in the Pegasys 180 mcg / Copegus arm .
In Study 2 , PegIntron / ribavirin combination therapy induced fatigue or headache in approximately two - thirds of subjects , with fever or rigors in approximately half of the subjects .
The severity of some of these systemic symptoms ( e . g . , fever and headache ) tended to decrease as treatment continued .
Subjects receiving ribavirin / PegIntron as re - treatment after failing a previous interferon combination regimen reported adverse reactions similar to those previously associated with this regimen during clinical trials of treatment - naïve subjects .
Pediatric Subjects In general , the adverse reaction profile in the pediatric population was similar to that observed in adults .
In the pediatric trial , the most prevalent adverse reactions were pyrexia ( 80 % ) , headache ( 62 % ) , neutropenia ( 33 % ) , fatigue ( 30 % ) , anorexia ( 29 % ) , injection - site erythema ( 29 % ) and vomiting ( 27 % ) .
The majority of adverse reactions were mild or moderate in severity .
Severe adverse reactions were reported in 7 % ( 8 / 107 ) of all subjects and included injection site pain ( 1 % ) , pain in extremity ( 1 % ) , headache ( 1 % ) , neutropenia ( 1 % ) , and pyrexia ( 4 % ) .
Important adverse reactions that occurred in this subject population were nervousness ( 7 % ; 7 / 107 ) , aggression ( 3 % ; 3 / 107 ) , anger ( 2 % ; 2 / 107 ) , and depression ( 1 % ; 1 / 107 ) .
Five subjects received levothyroxine treatment , three with clinical hypothyroidism and two with asymptomatic TSH elevations .
Weight and height gain of pediatric subjects treated with PegIntron plus ribavirin lagged behind that predicted by normative population data for the entire length of treatment .
Severely inhibited growth velocity ( less than 3 rd percentile ) was observed in 70 % of the subjects while on treatment .
Dose modifications of PegIntron and / or ribavirin were required in 25 % of subjects due to treatment - related adverse reactions , most commonly for anemia , neutropenia and weight loss .
Two subjects ( 2 % ; 2 / 107 ) discontinued therapy as the result of an adverse reaction .
Adverse reactions that occurred with a greater than or equal to 10 % incidence in the pediatric trial subjects are provided in Table 7 .

The long - term effects on growth were less in subjects treated for 24 weeks than in those treated for 48 weeks .
Twenty - four percent of subjects ( 11 / 46 ) treated for 24 weeks and 40 % of subjects ( 19 / 48 ) treated for 48 weeks had a > 15 percentile height - for - age decrease from pre - treatment baseline to the end of 5 - year follow - up .
Eleven percent of subjects ( 5 / 46 ) treated for 24 weeks and 13 % of subjects ( 6 / 48 ) treated for 48 weeks had a > 30 percentile height - for - age decrease from pre - treatment baseline to the end of the 5 - year follow - up .
While observed across all age groups , the highest risk for reduced height at the end of long - term follow - up appeared to be initiation of combination therapy during the years of expected peak growth velocity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] .
Laboratory Values Adult and Pediatric Subjects The adverse reaction profile in Study 3 , which compared PegIntron / weight - based ribavirin combination to a PegIntron / flat dose ribavirin regimen , revealed an increased rate of anemia with weight - based dosing ( 29 % vs . 19 % for weight - based vs . flat dose regimens , respectively ) .
However , the majority of cases of anemia were mild and responded to dose reductions .
Changes in selected laboratory values during treatment in combination with ribavirin treatment are described below .
Decreases in hemoglobin , leukocytes , neutrophils , and platelets may require dose reduction or permanent discontinuation from therapy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Changes in selected laboratory values during therapy are described in Table 8 .
Most of the changes in laboratory values in the PegIntron / ribavirin trial with pediatrics were mild or moderate .

In Study 2 , hemoglobin levels decreased to less than 11 g / dL in about 30 % of subjects .
In Study 3 , 47 % of subjects receiving weight - based dosing of ribavirin and 33 % on flat - dose ribavirin had decreases in hemoglobin levels to less than 11 g / dL .
Reductions in hemoglobin to less than 9 g / dL occurred more frequently in subjects receiving weight - based dosing compared to flat dosing ( 4 % and 2 % , respectively ) .
In Study 2 , dose modification was required in 9 % and 13 % of subjects in the PegIntron / ribavirin and INTRON A / ribavirin groups .
In Study 4 , subjects receiving PegIntron ( 1 . 5 mcg / kg ) / ribavirin had decreases in hemoglobin levels to between 8 . 5 to less than 10 g / dL ( 28 % ) and to less than 8 . 5 g / dL ( 3 % ) , whereas in patients receiving Pegasys 180 mcg / Copegus these decreases occurred in 26 % and 4 % of subjects , respectively .
On average , hemoglobin levels became stable by treatment weeks 4 to 6 .
The typical pattern observed was a decrease in hemoglobin levels by treatment week 4 followed by stabilization and a plateau , which was maintained to the end of treatment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Neutrophils .
In Study 2 , decreases in neutrophil counts were observed in a majority of adult subjects treated with PegIntron / ribavirin ( 85 % ) and INTRON A / ribavirin ( 60 % ) .
Severe , potentially life - threatening neutropenia ( less than 0 . 5 x 109 / L ) occurred in approximately 4 % of subjects treated with PegIntron / ribavirin and 2 % of subjects treated with INTRON A / ribavirin .
Eighteen percent of subjects receiving PegIntron / ribavirin required modification of interferon dosage .
Few subjects ( less than 1 % ) required permanent discontinuation of treatment .
Neutrophil counts generally returned to pre - treatment levels 4 weeks after cessation of therapy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Platelets .
In Study 2 , platelet counts decreased to less than 100 , 000 / mm3 in approximately 20 % of subjects treated with PegIntron alone or with ribavirin and in 6 % of adult subjects treated with INTRON A / ribavirin .
Severe decreases in platelet counts ( less than 50 , 000 / mm3 ) occur in less than 4 % of adult subjects .
In Study 2 , 1 % or 3 % of subjects required dose modification of INTRON A or PegIntron , respectively .
Platelet counts generally returned to pretreatment levels 4 weeks after the cessation of therapy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Thyroid Function .
In Study 2 , clinically apparent thyroid disorders occurred among subjects treated with either INTRON A or PegIntron ( with or without ribavirin ) at a similar incidence ( 5 % for hypothyroidism and 3 % for hyperthyroidism ) .
Subjects developed new onset TSH abnormalities while on treatment and during the follow - up period .
At the end of the follow - up period , 7 % of subjects still had abnormal TSH values .
Bilirubin and Uric Acid .
In Study 2 , 10 to 14 % of subjects developed hyperbilirubinemia and 33 to 38 % developed hyperuricemia in association with hemolysis .
Six subjects developed mild to moderate gout .
Adverse Reactions with ribavirin / INTRON A Combination Therapy Adult Subjects In clinical trials , 19 % and 6 % of previously untreated and relapse subjects , respectively , discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions in the combination arms compared to 13 % and 3 % in the interferon - only arms .
Selected treatment - related adverse reactions that occurred in the US trials with incidence 5 % or greater are provided by treatment group ( see Table 9 ) .
In general , the selected treatment - related adverse reactions were reported with lower incidence in the international trials as compared to the US trials , except for asthenia , influenza - like symptoms , nervousness , and pruritus .
Pediatric Subjects In clinical trials of 118 pediatric subjects 3 to 16 years of age , 6 % discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions .
Dose modifications were required in 30 % of subjects , most commonly for anemia and neutropenia .
In general , the adverse - reaction profile in the pediatric population was similar to that observed in adults .
Injection site disorders , fever , anorexia , vomiting , and emotional lability occurred more frequently in pediatric subjects compared to adult subjects .
Conversely , pediatric subjects experienced less fatigue , dyspepsia , arthralgia , insomnia , irritability , impaired concentration , dyspnea , and pruritus compared to adult subjects .
Selected treatment - related adverse reactions that occurred with incidence 5 % or greater among all pediatric subjects who received the recommended dose of ribavirin / INTRON A combination therapy are provided in Table 9 .

A subject may have reported more than one adverse reaction within a body system / organ class category .
During a 48 - week course of therapy there was a decrease in the rate of linear growth ( mean percentile assignment decrease of 7 % ) and a decrease in the rate of weight gain ( mean percentile assignment decrease of 9 % ) .
A general reversal of these trends was noted during the 24 - week post - treatment period .
Long - term data in a limited number of patients , however , suggests that combination therapy may induce a growth inhibition that results in reduced final adult height in some patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] .
Laboratory Values Changes in selected hematologic values ( hemoglobin , white blood cells , neutrophils , and platelets ) during therapy are described below ( see Table 10 ) .
Hemoglobin .
Hemoglobin decreases among subjects receiving ribavirin therapy began at Week 1 , with stabilization by Week 4 .
In previously untreated subjects treated for 48 weeks , the mean maximum decrease from baseline was 3 . 1 g / dL in the US trial and 2 . 9 g / dL in the international trial .
In relapse subjects , the mean maximum decrease from baseline was 2 . 8 g / dL in the US trial and 2 . 6 g / dL in the international trial .
Hemoglobin values returned to pretreatment levels within 4 to 8 weeks of cessation of therapy in most subjects .
Bilirubin and Uric Acid .
Increases in both bilirubin and uric acid , associated with hemolysis , were noted in clinical trials .
Most changes were moderate and reversed within 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation .
This observation occurred most frequently in subjects with a previous diagnosis of Gilbert ' s syndrome .
This has not been associated with hepatic dysfunction or clinical morbidity .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Blood and Lymphatic System disorders : Pure red cell aplasia , aplastic anemia Ear and Labyrinth disorders : Hearing disorder , vertigo Respiratory , Thoracic and Mediastinal disorders : Pulmonary hypertension Eyedisorders : Serous retinal detachment Endocrine disorders : Diabetes 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Nucleoside analogues : Closely monitor for toxicities .
Discontinue nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or reduce dose or discontinue interferon , ribavirin or both with worsening toxicities .
( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Didanosine Exposure to didanosine or its active metabolite ( dideoxyadenosine 5 ' - triphosphate ) is increased when didanosine is coadministered with ribavirin , which could cause or worsen clinical toxicities ; therefore , coadministration of ribavirin capsules and didanosine is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Reports of fatal hepatic failure , as well as peripheral neuropathy , pancreatitis , and symptomatic hyperlactatemia / lactic acidosis have been reported in clinical trials .
7 . 2 Nucleoside Analogues Hepatic decompensation ( some fatal ) has occurred in cirrhotic HIV / HCV co - infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV and interferon alpha and ribavirin .
Patients receiving interferon with ribavirin and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs ) should be closely monitored for treatment - associated toxicities , especially hepatic decompensation and anemia .
Discontinuation of NRTIs should be considered as medically appropriate [ see labeling forindividual NRTI product ] .
Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon , ribavirin , or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed , including hepatic decompensation ( e . g . , Child - Pugh greater than 6 ) .
Ribavirin may antagonize the cell culture antiviral activity of stavudine and zidovudine against HIV .
Ribavirin has been shown in cell culture to inhibit phosphorylation of lamivudine , stavudine and zidovudine , which could lead to decreased antiretroviral activity .
However , in a study with another pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin , no pharmacokinetic ( e . g . , plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations ) or pharmacodynamic ( e . g . , loss of HIV / HCV virologic suppress ) interaction was observed when ribavirin and lamivudine ( n = 18 ) , stavudine ( n = 10 ) , or zidovudine ( n = 6 ) were coadministered as part of a multidrug regimen in HIV / HCV co - infected subjects .
Concomitant use of ribavirin with any of these drugs should be done with caution .
7 . 3 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P - 450 Results of in vitro studies using both human and rat liver microsome preparations indicated little or no cytochrome P - 450 enzyme - mediated metabolism of ribavirin , with minimal potential for P - 450 enzyme - based drug interactions .
No pharmacokinetic interactions were noted between INTRON A and ribavirin capsules in a multiple - dose pharmacokinetic study .
7 . 4 Azathioprine The use of ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in patients receiving azathioprine has been reported to induce severe pancytopenia and may increase the risk of azathioprine - related myelotoxicity .
Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMDH ) is required for one of the metabolic pathways of azathioprine .
Ribavirin is known to inhibit IMDH , thereby leading to accumulation of an azathioprine metabolite , 6 - methylthioinosine monophosphate ( 6 - MTITP ) , which is associated with myelotoxicity ( neutropenia , thrombocytopenia , and anemia ) .
Patients receiving azathioprine with ribavirin should have complete blood counts , including platelet counts , monitored weekly for the first month , twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment , then monthly or more frequently if dosage or other therapy changes are necessary [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pediatrics : Safety and efficacy in patients less than 3 years old have not been established .
( 8 . 4 ) • Organ transplant recipients : Safety and efficacy not studied .
( 8 . 6 ) • Co - infected patients : Safety and efficacy with HIV or HBV co - infection have not been established .
( 8 . 7 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Ribavirin is contraindicated for use in pregnant women and in men whose female partners are pregnant [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Based on animal data , ribavirin use in pregnancy may be associated with birth defects .
Data from the Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry are insufficient to identify a drug - associated risk of birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ) .
Ribavirin is known to accumulate in intracellular components from where it is cleared very slowly .
In animal studies , ribavirin exposure was shown to have teratogenic and / or embryocidal effects ( see Data ) .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data Available data from the Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry on 88 live births from pregnancies in women directly exposed and 98 live births from pregnancies in women indirectly exposed ( by a male partner ) to ribavirin during pregnancy or during the 6 months prior to pregnancy show a higher rate of birth defects ( 9 . 09 % and 6 . 12 % , respectively ) compared to a background birth defect rate of 2 . 72 % in the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program ( MACDP ) birth defects surveillance system .
No pattern of birth defects can be identified from these reports .
The miscarriage rate was approximately 21 % .
The current sample size is insufficient for reaching definitive conclusions based on statistical analysis .
Trends suggesting a common etiology or relationship with ribavirin exposure were not observed .
Methodologic limitations of the Ribavirin Pregnancy Registry include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group .
Limitations of using an external comparator include differences in methodology and populations , as well as confounding due to the underlying disease and comorbidities .
Animal Data Embryotoxicity / teratogenicity studies with ribavirin were conducted in rats ( oral doses of 0 . 3 , 1 . 0 and 10 mg / kg on Gestation Days 6 to 15 ) and rabbits ( oral dose of 0 . 1 , 0 . 3 and 1 . 0 mg / kg on Gestation Days 6 to 18 ) .
Ribavirin demonstrated significant embryocidal and teratogenic effects at doses well below the recommended human dose in all animal species in which adequate studies have been conducted .
Malformations of the skull , palate , eye , jaw , limbs , skeleton , and gastrointestinal tract were noted .
The incidence and severity of teratogenic effects increased with escalation of the drug dose .
Survival of fetuses and offspring was reduced [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of ribavirin in human milk or the effects on the breastfed infant or milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for ribavirin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ribavirin or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Ribavirin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Ribavirin therapy should not be started until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained immediately prior to planned initiation of treatment .
Patients should have periodic pregnancy tests during treatment and during the 6 - month period after treatment has been stopped [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months post - therapy based on a multiple - dose half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of ribavirin of 12 days ( e . g . , 15 half - lives for ribavirin clearance from the body ) .
Male patients and their female partners should use effective contraception during treatment with ribavirin and for the 6 - month post - therapy period [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Based on animal data , ribavirin may impair male fertility .
In animal studies , these effects were mostly reversible within a few months after drug cessation [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of ribavirin in combination with PegIntron has not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 3 years .
For treatment with ribavirin / INTRON A , evidence of disease progression , such as hepatic inflammation and fibrosis , as well as prognostic factors for response , HCV genotype and viral load should be considered when deciding to treat a pediatric patient .
The benefits of treatment should be weighed against the observed safety findings .
Long - term follow - up data in pediatric subjects indicates that ribavirin in combination with PegIntron or with INTRON A may induce a growth inhibition that results in reduced height in some patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Suicidal ideation or attempts occurred more frequently among pediatric patients , primarily adolescents , compared to adult patients ( 2 . 4 % vs . 1 % ) during treatment and off - therapy follow - up [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 ) ] .
As in adult patients , pediatric patients experienced other psychiatric adverse reactions ( e . g . , depression , emotional lability , somnolence ) , anemia , and neutropenia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of ribavirin combination therapy did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine if they respond differently from younger subjects .
Ribavirin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients often have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection .
Renal function should be monitored and dosage adjustments made accordingly .
Ribavirin should not be used in patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL / min [ seeContraindications ( 4 ) ] .
In general , ribavirin capsules should be administered to elderly patients cautiously , starting at the lower end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic and cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
In clinical trials , elderly subjects had a higher frequency of anemia ( 67 % ) than younger patients ( 28 % ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 6 Organ Transplant Recipients The safety and efficacy of INTRON A and PegIntron alone or in combination with ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis C in liver or other organ transplant recipients have not been established .
In a small ( n = 16 ) single - center , uncontrolled case experience , renal failure in renal allograft recipients receiving interferon alpha and ribavirin combination therapy was more frequent than expected from the center ' s previous experience with renal allograft recipients not receiving combination therapy .
The relationship of the renal failure to renal allograft rejection is not clear .
8 . 7 HIV or HBV Co - infection The safety and efficacy of PegIntron / ribavirin and INTRON A / ribavirin for the treatment of patients with HCV co - infected with HIV or HBV have not been established .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is limited experience with overdosage .
Acute ingestion of up to 20 g of ribavirin capsules , INTRON A ingestion of up to 120 million units , and subcutaneous doses of INTRON A up to 10 times the recommended doses have been reported .
Primary effects that have been observed are increased incidence and severity of the adverse reactions related to the therapeutic use of INTRON A and ribavirin capsules .
However , hepatic enzyme abnormalities , renal failure , hemorrhage , and myocardial infarction have been reported with administration of single subcutaneous doses of INTRON A that exceed dosing recommendations .
There is no specific antidote for INTRON A or ribavirin overdose , and hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective for treatment of overdose of these agents .
11 DESCRIPTION Ribavirin is a synthetic nucleoside analogue ( purine analogue ) .
The chemical name of ribavirin is 1 - β - D - ribofuranosyl - 1 H - 1 , 2 , 4 - triazole - 3 - carboxamide and has the following structural formula ( see Figure 1 ) .
Figure 1 : Structural Formula [ MULTIMEDIA ] Ribavirin , USP is a white , crystalline powder .
It is freely soluble in water and slightly soluble in dehydrated alcohol .
The molecular formula is C8H12N4O5 and the molecular weight is 244 . 21 .
Each ribavirin capsule , USP intended for oral administration contains 200 mg of ribavirin , USP in white , hard gelatin capsule shells .
In addition , each capsule contains the following inactive ingredients : crospovidone , magnesium stearate , microcrystalline cellulose , povidone , and silicon dioxide .
The capsule shell consists of gelatin and titanium dioxide .
It may also contain sodium lauryl sulfate .
The capsule is printed with black pharmaceutical ink .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Ribavirin is an anti - HCV agent [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Single - and multiple - dose pharmacokinetic properties in adults are summarized in Table 11 .
Ribavirin was rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration .
However , due to first - pass metabolism , the absolute bioavailability averaged 64 % ( 44 % ) .
There was a linear relationship between dose and AUCtf ( AUC from time zero to last measurable concentration ) following single doses of 200 to 1200 mg ribavirin .
The relationship between dose and Cmax was curvilinear , tending to asymptote above single doses of 400 to 600 mg .
Upon multiple oral dosing , based on AUC12hr , a 6 fold accumulation of ribavirin was observed in plasma .
Following oral dosing with 600 mg twice daily , steady - state was reached by approximately 4 weeks , with mean steady - state plasma concentrations of 2200 ng / mL ( 37 % ) .
Upon discontinuation of dosing , the mean half - life was 298 ( 30 % ) hours , which probably reflects slow elimination from nonplasma compartments .
Effect of Antacid on Absorption of Ribavirin Coadministration of ribavirin capsules with an antacid containing magnesium , aluminum , and simethicone resulted in a 14 % decrease in mean ribavirin AUCtf .
The clinical relevance of results from this single - dose study is unknown .

This type of transporter is present on virtually all cell types and may account for the extensive volume of distribution .
Ribavirin does not bind to plasma proteins .
Metabolism and Excretion Ribavirin has two pathways of metabolism : ( i ) a reversible phosphorylation pathway in nucleated cells ; and ( ii ) a degradative pathway involving deribosylation and amide hydrolysis to yield a triazole carboxylic acid metabolite .
Ribavirin and its triazole carboxamide and triazole carboxylic acid metabolites are excreted renally .
After oral administration of 600 mg of 14 C - ribavirin , approximately 61 % and 12 % of the radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and feces , respectively , in 336 hours .
Unchanged ribavirin accounted for 17 % of the administered dose .
Special Populations Renal Dysfunction The pharmacokinetics of ribavirin were assessed after administration of a single oral dose ( 400 mg ) of ribavirin to non - HCV - infected subjects with varying degrees of renal dysfunction .
The mean AUCtf value was threefold greater in subjects with creatinine clearance values between 10 to 30 mL / min when compared to control subjects ( creatinine clearance greater than 90 mL / min ) .
In subjects with creatinine clearance values between 30 to 60 mL / min , AUCtf was twofold greater when compared to control subjects .
The increased AUCtf appears to be due to reduction of renal and nonrenal clearance in these subjects .
Phase 3 efficacy trials included subjects with creatinine clearance values greater than 50 mL / min .
The multiple - dose pharmacokinetics of ribavirin cannot be accurately predicted in patients with renal dysfunction .
Ribavirin is not effectively removed by hemodialysis .
Patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL / min should not be treated with ribavirin [ seeContraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Hepatic Dysfunction The effect of hepatic dysfunction was assessed after a single oral dose of ribavirin ( 600 mg ) .
The mean AUCtf values were not significantly different in subjects with mild , moderate , or severe hepatic dysfunction ( Child - Pugh Classification A , B , or C ) when compared to control subjects .
However , the mean Cmax values increased with severity of hepatic dysfunction and was twofold greater in subjects with severe hepatic dysfunction when compared to control subjects .
Elderly Patients Pharmacokinetic evaluations in elderly subjects have not been performed .
Gender There were no clinically significant pharmacokinetic differences noted in a single - dose trial of 18 male and 18 female subjects .
Pediatric Patients Multiple - dose pharmacokinetic properties for ribavirin capsules and INTRON A in pediatric subjects with chronic hepatitis C between 5 and 16 years of age are summarized in Table 12 .
The pharmacokinetics of ribavirin and INTRON A ( dose - normalized ) are similar in adults and pediatric subjects .
Complete pharmacokinetic characteristics of ribavirin oral solution have not been determined in pediatric subjects .
Ribavirin Cmin values were similar following administration of ribavirin oral solution or ribavirin capsules during 48 weeks of therapy in pediatric subjects ( 3 to 16 years of age ) .

In pediatric subjects receiving body surface area - adjusted dosing of PegIntron at 60 mcg / m2 / week , the log transformed ratio estimate of exposure during the dosing interval was predicted to be 58 % [ 90 % CI : 141 % , 177 % ] higher than observed in adults receiving 1 . 5 mcg / kg / week .
The pharmacokinetics of ribavirin ( dose - normalized ) in this trial were similar to those reported in a prior study of ribavirin in combination with INTRON A in pediatric subjects and in adults .
Effect of Food on Absorption of Ribavirin Both AUCtf and Cmax increased by 70 % when ribavirin capsules were administered with a high - fat meal ( 841 kcal , 53 . 8 g fat , 31 . 6 g protein , and 57 . 4 g carbohydrate ) in a single - dose pharmacokinetic study [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The mechanism by which ribavirin contributes to its antiviral efficacy in the clinic is not fully understood .
Ribavirin has direct antiviral activity in cell culture against many RNA viruses .
Ribavirin increases the mutation frequency in the genomes of several RNA viruses and ribavirin triphosphate inhibits HCV polymerase in a biochemical reaction .
Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture The antiviral activity of ribavirin in the HCV replicon is not well understood and has not been defined because of the cellular toxicity of ribavirin .
Direct antiviral activity has been observed in cell culture of other RNA viruses .
The anti - HCV activity of interferon was demonstrated in cell culture using self - replicating HCV RNA ( HCV replicon cells ) or HCV infection .
Resistance HCV genotypes show wide variability in their response to pegylated recombinant human interferon / ribavirin therapy .
Genetic changes associated with the variable response have not been identified .
Cross - resistance There is no reported cross - resistance between pegylated / non - pegylated interferons and ribavirin .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Ribavirin did not cause an increase in any tumor type when administered for 6 months in the transgenic p53 deficient mouse model at doses up to 300 mg / kg ( estimated human equivalent of 25 mg / kg based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult ; approximately 1 . 9 times the maximum recommended human daily dose ) .
Ribavirin was noncarcinogenic when administered for 2 years to rats at doses up to 40 mg / kg ( estimated human equivalent of 5 . 71 mg / kg based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult ) .
Mutagenesis Ribavirin demonstrated increased incidences of mutation and cell transformation in multiple genotoxicity assays .
Ribavirin was active in the Balb / 3T3 In Vitro Cell Transformation Assay .
Mutagenic activity was observed in the mouse lymphoma assay , and at doses of 20 to 200 mg / kg ( estimated human equivalent of 1 . 67 to 16 . 7 mg / kg , based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult ; 0 . 1 to 1 times the maximum recommended human 24 - hour dose of ribavirin ) in a mouse micronucleus assay .
A dominant lethal assay in rats was negative , indicating that if mutations occurred in rats they were not transmitted through male gametes .
Impairment of Fertility In studies in mice to evaluate the time course and reversibility of ribavirin - induced testicular degeneration at doses of 15 to 150 mg / kg / day ( estimated human equivalent of 1 . 25 to 12 . 5 mg / kg / day , based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 - kg adult ; 0 . 1 to 0 . 8 times the maximum human 24 - hour dose of ribavirin ) administered for 3 or 6 months , abnormalities in sperm occurred .
Upon cessation of treatment , recovery from ribavirin - induced testicular toxicity was mostly apparent within 1 or 2 spermatogenesis cycles .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and Pharmacology Long - term studies in the mouse and rat [ 18 to 24 months ; doses of 20 to 75 and 10 to 40 mg / kg / day , respectively ( estimated human equivalent doses of 1 . 67 to 6 . 25 and 1 . 43 to 5 . 71 mg / kg / day , respectively , based on body surface area adjustment for a 60 kg adult ; approximately 0 . 1 to 0 . 4 times the maximum human 24 - hour dose of ribavirin ) ] have demonstrated a relationship between chronic ribavirin exposure and increased incidences of vascular lesions ( microscopic hemorrhages ) in mice .
In rats , retinal degeneration occurred in controls , but the incidence was increased in ribavirintreated rats .
In a study in which rat pups were dosed postnatally with ribavirin at doses of 10 , 25 , and 50 mg / kg / day , drug - related deaths occurred at 50 mg / kg ( at rat pup plasma concentrations below human plasma concentrations at the human therapeutic dose ) between study Days 13 and 48 .
Rat pups dosed from postnatal Days 7 through 63 demonstrated a minor , dose - related decrease in overall growth at all doses , which was subsequently manifested as slight decreases in body weight , crown - rump length , and bone length .
These effects showed evidence of reversibility , and no histopathological effects on bone were observed .
No ribavirin effects were observed regarding neurobehavioral or reproductive development .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Clinical Study 1 evaluated PegIntron monotherapy .
See PegIntron labeling for information about this trial .
14 . 1 Ribavirin / PegIntron Combination Therapy Adult Subjects Study 2 A randomized trial compared treatment with two PegIntron / ribavirin regimens [ PegIntron 1 . 5 mcg / kg subcutaneously once weekly / ribavirin 800 mg orally daily ( in divided doses ) ; PegIntron 1 . 5 mcg / kg subcutaneously once weekly for 4 weeks then 0 . 5 mcg / kg subcutaneously once weekly for 44 weeks / ribavirin 1 , 000 or 1 , 200 mg orally daily ( in divided doses ) ] with INTRON A [ 3 MIU subcutaneously three times weekly / ribavirin 1 , 000 or 1 , 200 mg orally daily ( in divided doses ) ] in 1 , 530 adults with chronic hepatitis C . Interferon - naïve subjects were treated for 48 weeks and followed for 24 weeks post - treatment .
Eligible subjects had compensated liver disease , detectable HCV - RNA , elevated ALT , and liver histopathology consistent with chronic hepatitis .
Response to treatment was defined as undetectable HCV - RNA at 24 weeks post - treatment ( see Table 13 ) .
The response rate to the PegIntron 1 . 5 mcg / kg and ribavirin 800 mg dose was higher than the response rate to INTRON A / ribavirin ( see Table 13 ) .
The response rate to PegIntron 1 . 5 → 0 . 5 mcg / kg / ribavirin was essentially the same as the response to INTRON A / ribavirin ( data not shown ) .
Table 13 Rates of Response to Combination Treatment – Study 2 * Serum HCV - RNA was measured with a research - based quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay by a central laboratory .
† Difference in overall treatment response ( PegIntron / ribavirin vs . INTRON A / ribavirin ) is 6 % with 95 % confidence interval of ( 0 . 18 , 11 . 63 ) adjusted for viral genotype and presence of cirrhosis at baseline .
Response to treatment was defined as undetectable HCV - RNA at 24 weeks post - treatment .

Subjects with both poor prognostic factors ( genotype 1 and high viral load ) had a response rate of 30 % ( 78 / 256 ) compared to a response rate of 29 % ( 71 / 247 ) with INTRON A / ribavirin combination therapy .
Subjects with lower body weight tended to have higher adverse - reaction rates [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] and higher response rates than subjects with higher body weights .
Differences in response rates between treatment arms did not substantially vary with body weight .
Treatment response rates with PegIntron / ribavirin combination therapy were 49 % in men and 56 % in women .
Response rates were lower in African American and Hispanic subjects and higher in Asians compared to Caucasians .
Although African Americans had a higher proportion of poor prognostic factors compared to Caucasians , the number of non - Caucasians studied ( 11 % of the total ) was insufficient to allow meaningful conclusions about differences in response rates after adjusting for prognostic factors in this trial .
Liver biopsies were obtained before and after treatment in 68 % of subjects .
Compared to baseline , approximately two - thirds of subjects in all treatment groups were observed to have a modest reduction in inflammation .
Study 3 In a large United States community - based trial , 4 , 913 subjects with chronic hepatitis C were randomized to receive PegIntron 1 . 5 mcg / kg subcutaneously once weekly in combination with a ribavirin dose of 800 to 1 , 400 mg ( weight - based dosing [ WBD ] ) or 800 mg ( flat ) orally daily ( in divided doses ) for 24 or 48 weeks based on genotype .
Response to treatment was defined as undetectable HCV - RNA ( based on an assay with a lower limit of detection of 125 IU / mL ) at 24 weeks post - treatment .
Treatment with PegIntron 1 . 5 mcg / kg and ribavirin 800 to 1 , 400 mg resulted in a higher sustained virologic response compared to PegIntron in combination with a flat 800 mg daily dose of ribavirin .
Subjects weighing greater than 105 kg obtained the greatest benefit with WBD , although a modest benefit was also observed in subjects weighing greater than 85 to 105 kg ( see Table 14 ) .
The benefit of WBD in subjects weighing greater than 85 kg was observed with HCV genotypes 1 to 3 .
Insufficient data were available to reach conclusions regarding other genotypes .
Use of WBD resulted in an increased incidence of anemia [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .

No additional benefit was observed with the longer treatment duration .
Study 4 A large randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of treatment for 48 weeks with two PegIntron / ribavirin regimens [ PegIntron 1 . 5 mcg / kg and 1 mcg / kg subcutaneously once weekly both in combination with ribavirin 800 to 1 , 400 mg PO daily ( in two divided doses ) ] and Pegasys 180 mcg subcutaneously once weekly in combination with Copegus 1 , 000 to 1 , 200 mg PO daily ( in two divided doses ) in 3 , 070 treatment - naïve adults with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 .
In this trial , lack of early virologic response ( undetectable HCV - RNA or greater than or equal to 2 log10 reduction from baseline ) by treatment Week 12 was the criterion for discontinuation of treatment .
SVR was defined as undetectable HCV - RNA ( Roche COBAS TaqMan assay , a lower limit of quantitation of 27 IU / mL ) at 24 weeks post - treatment ( see Table 15 ) .
Table 15 SVR Rate by Treatment – Study 4 % ( number ) of Subjects PegIntron 1 . 5 mcg / kg / Ribavirin PegIntron 1 mcg / kg / Ribavirin Pegasys 180 mcg / Copegus 40 ( 406 / 1 , 019 ) 38 ( 386 / 1 , 016 ) 41 ( 423 / 1 , 035 ) Overall SVR rates were similar among the three treatment groups .
Regardless of treatment group , SVR rates were lower in subjects with poor prognostic factors .
Subjects with poor prognostic factors randomized to PegIntron ( 1 . 5 mcg / kg ) / ribavirin or Pegasys / Copegus , however , achieved higher SVR rates compared to similar subjects randomized to PegIntron 1 mcg / kg / ribavirin .
For the PegIntron 1 . 5 mcg / kg and ribavirin dose , SVR rates for subjects with and without the following prognostic factors were as follows : cirrhosis ( 10 % vs . 42 % ) , normal ALT levels ( 32 % vs . 42 % ) , baseline viral load greater than 600 , 000 IU / mL ( 35 % vs . 61 % ) , 40 years of age and older ( 38 % vs . 50 % ) , and African American race ( 23 % vs . 44 % ) .
In subjects with undetectable HCV - RNA at treatment Week 12 who received PegIntron ( 1 . 5 mcg / kg ) / ribavirin , the SVR rate was 81 % ( 328 / 407 ) .
Study 5 - Ribavirin / PegIntron Combination Therapy in Prior Treatment Failures In a noncomparative trial , 2 , 293 subjects with moderate to severe fibrosis who failed previous treatment with combination alpha interferon / ribavirin were re - treated with PegIntron , 1 . 5 mcg / kg subcutaneously , once weekly , in combination with weight adjusted ribavirin .
Eligible subjects included prior nonresponders ( subjects who were HCV - RNA positive at the end of a minimum 12 weeks of treatment ) and prior relapsers ( subjects who were HCV - RNA negative at the end of a minimum 12 weeks of treatment and subsequently relapsed after post - treatment follow - up ) .
Subjects who were negative at Week 12 were treated for 48 weeks and followed for 24 weeks post - treatment .
Response to treatment was defined as undetectable HCV - RNA at 24 weeks post - treatment ( measured using a research - based test , limit of detection 125 IU / mL ) .
The overall response rate was 22 % ( 497 / 2 , 293 ) ( 99 % CI : 19 . 5 , 23 . 9 ) .

In this trial , 1 , 470 ( 64 % ) subjects did not achieve an undetectable HCV - RNA at treatment Week 12 , and were offered enrollment into long - term treatment trials , due to an inadequate treatment response .
Of the 823 ( 36 % ) subjects who were HCV - RNA undetectable at treatment Week 12 , those infected with genotype 1 had an SVR of 48 % ( 245 / 507 ) , with a range of responses by fibrosis scores ( F4 - F2 ) of 39 to 55 % .
Subjects infected with genotype 2 / 3 who were HCV - RNA undetectable at treatment Week 12 had an overall SVR of 70 % ( 196 / 281 ) , with a range of responses by fibrosis scores ( F4 - F2 ) of 60 to 83 % .
For all genotypes , higher fibrosis scores were associated with a decreased likelihood of achieving SVR .
Pediatric Subjects Previously untreated pediatric subjects 3 to 17 years of age with compensated chronic hepatitis C and detectable HCV - RNA were treated with ribavirin 15 mg / kg per day and PegIntron 60 mcg / m2 once weekly for 24 or 48 weeks based on HCV genotype and baseline viral load .
All subjects were to be followed for 24 weeks post - treatment .
A total of 107 subjects received treatment , of which 52 % were female , 89 % were Caucasian , and 67 % were infected with HCV Genotype 1 .
Subjects infected with Genotypes 1 , 4 or Genotype 3 with HCV - RNA greater than or equal to 600 , 000 IU / mL received 48 weeks of therapy while those infected with Genotype 2 or Genotype 3 with HCV - RNA less than 600 , 000 IU / mL received 24 weeks of therapy .
