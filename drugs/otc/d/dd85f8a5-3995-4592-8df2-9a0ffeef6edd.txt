WARNINGS Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity and infusion reactions , including hypotension , pyrexia , tremor , chills , urticaria , rash , and pruritus have been reported with 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP .
Stop the infusion immediately if signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction develop , such as tachycardia , chest pain , dyspnea and flushing .
Appropriate therapeutic countermeasures must be instituted as clinically indicated .
Electrolyte Imbalances Fluid Overload Depending on the volume and rate of infusion , and the patient â€™ s underlying clinical condition , the intravenous administration of Sodium Chloride Injection , USP can cause fluid disturbances such as overhydration / hypervolemia and congested states , including pulmonary congestion and edema .
Avoid 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP in patients with or at risk for fluid and / or solute overloading .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor fluid balance , electrolyte concentrations , and acid base balance , as needed and especially during prolonged use .
Hyponatremia Sodium Chloride Injection , USP may cause hyponatremia .
Hyponatremia can lead to acute hyponatremic encephalopathy characterized by headache , nausea , seizures , lethargy , and vomiting .
Patients with brain edema are at particular risk of severe , irreversible and life - threatening brain injury .
The risk of hospital - acquired hyponatremia is increased in patients with cardiac or pulmonary failure , and in patients with non - osmotic vasopressin release ( including SIADH ) treated with high volume of Sodium Chloride Injection , USP .
The risk for hyponatremia is increased in pediatric patients , elderly patients , postoperative patients , those with psychogenic polydipsia , and in patients treated with medications that increase the risk of hyponatremia ( such as diuretics , certain antiepileptic and psychotropic medications ) .
See Drug Interactions .
Patients at increased risk for developing complications of hyponatremia such as hyponatremic encephalopathy , include pediatric patients , women ( in particular pre - menopausal women ) , patients with hypoxemia , and patients with underlying central nervous system disease .
Avoid Sodium Chloride Injection , USP in patients with or at risk for hyponatremia .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor serum sodium concentrations .
Rapid correction of hyponatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications .
Brain adaptations reducing risk of cerebral edema make the brain vulnerable to injury when chronic hyponatremia is too rapidly corrected , which is known as osmotic demyelination syndrome ( ODS ) .
To avoid complications , monitor serum sodium and chloride concentrations , fluid status , acid - base balance , and signs of neurologic complications .
Hypernatremia Hypernatremia may occur with Sodium Chloride Injection , USP .
Conditions that may increase the risk of hypernatremia , fluid overload and edema ( central and peripheral ) , include patients with : primary hyperaldosteronism ; secondary hyperaldosteronism associated with , for example , hypertension , congestive heart failure , liver disease ( including cirrhosis ) , renal disease ( including renal artery stenosis , nephrosclerosis ) ; and pre - eclampsia .
Certain medications such as corticosteroids or corticotropin , may also increase risk of sodium and fluid retention , see Drug Interactions .
Avoid Sodium Chloride Injection , USP in patients with , or at risk for , hypernatremia .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor serum sodium concentrations .
Rapid correction of hypernatremia is potentially dangerous with risk of serious neurologic complications .
Excessively rapid correction of hypernatremia is also associated with a risk for serious neurologic complications such as osmotic demyelination syndrome ( ODS ) with risk of seizures and cerebral edema .
PRECAUTIONS Patients with Severe Renal Impairment Administration of Sodium Chloride Injection , USP in patients with or at risk of severe renal impairment , may result in hypernatremia and / or fluid overload ( see Warnings ) .
Avoid Sodium Chloride Injection , USP in patients with severe renal impairment or conditions that may cause sodium and / or potassium retention , fluid overload , or edema .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor patients with severe renal impairment for development of these adverse reactions .
Drug Interactions Other Products that Affect Fluid and / or Electrolyte Balance Administration of Sodium Chloride Injection , USP to patients treated concomitantly with drugs associated with sodium and fluid retention may increase the risk of hypernatremia and volume overload .
Avoid use of Sodium Chloride Injection , USP in patients receiving such products , such as corticosteroids or corticotropin .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor serum electrolytes , fluid balance and acid - base balance .
Lithium Renal sodium and lithium clearance may be increased during administration of 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP .
Monitor serum lithium concentrations during concomitant use .
Other Drugs that Increase the Risk of Hyponatremia Administration of Sodium Chloride Injection , USP in patients treated concomitantly with medications associated with hyponatremia may increase the risk of developing hyponatremia .
Avoid use of Sodium Chloride Injection , USP in patients receiving products , such as diuretics , and certain antiepileptic and psychotropic medications .
Drugs that increase the vasopressin effect reduce renal electrolyte free water excretion and may also increase the risk of hyponatremia following treatment with intravenous fluids .
If use cannot be avoided , monitor serum sodium concentrations .
Pregnancy There are no adequate and well controlled studies with Sodium Chloride Injection , USP in pregnant women and animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this drug .
Therefore , it is not known whether Sodium Chloride Injection , USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Sodium Chloride Injection , USP should be given during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Lactation It is not known whether this drug is present in human milk .
Because many drugs are present in human milk , caution should be exercised when Sodium Chloride Injection , USP is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use The use of Sodium Chloride Injection , USP in pediatric patients is based on clinical practice .
( See Dosage and Administration ) .
Closely monitor plasma electrolyte concentrations in pediatric patients who may have impaired ability to regulate fluids and electrolytes .
In very low birth weight infants , excessive or rapid administration of Sodium Chloride Injection , USP may result in increased serum osmolality and risk of intracerebral hemorrhage .
Children ( including neonates and older children ) are at increased risk of developing hyponatremia as well as for developing hyponatremic encephalopathy .
Geriatric Use Geriatric patients are at increased risk of developing electrolyte imbalances .
Sodium Chloride Injection , USP is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Therefore , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
Consider monitoring renal function in elderly patients .
