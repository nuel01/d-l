C - 0047 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Twenty - eight patients received POMALYST 5 mg taken orally once daily on Days 1 through 21 of repeated 28 - day cycles .
The study excluded patients with procoagulant disorders or a history of venous or arterial thromboembolism .
Patients received DVT prophylaxis with daily low dose aspirin .
Across all patients treated on Trial 12 - C - 0047 , 75 % were exposed to pomalidomide for 6 months or longer and 25 % were exposed for greater than one year .
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 18 % ( 5 / 28 ) of patients who received POMALYST .
The following serious adverse reactions each occurred in 1 patient : anemia , decreased neutrophil count , and hematuria .
Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction occurred in 11 % ( 3 / 28 ) of patients who received POMALYST .
Dosage interruptions due to an adverse reaction occurred in 14 % ( 4 / 28 ) of patients who received POMALYST .
The most frequent adverse reaction requiring dosage interruption was decreased neutrophil count , which occurred in 3 patients .
The POMALYST dose was reduced due to an adverse reaction in 1 patient due to gout .
Tables 5 and 6 summarize the adverse reactions and select laboratory abnormalities reported in Trial 12 - C - 0047 .

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : Pancytopenia Endocrine Disorders : Hypothyroidism , hyperthyroidism Gastrointestinal Disorders : Gastrointestinal hemorrhage Hepatobiliary Disorders : Hepatic failure ( including fatal cases ) , elevated liver enzymes Immune system Disorders : Allergic reactions ( e . g . , angioedema , anaphylaxis , urticaria ) , solid organ transplant rejection Infections and Infestations : Hepatitis B virus reactivation , Herpes zoster , progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) Neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( incl cysts and polyps ) : Tumor lysis syndrome , basal cell carcinoma , and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Stevens - Johnson Syndrome , toxic epidermal necrolysis , drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors : Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors .
If concomitant use of a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor is unavoidable , reduce POMALYST dose to 2 mg ( 2 . 6 , 7 . 1 , 12 . 3 ) .
7 . 1 Drugs That Affect Pomalidomide Plasma Concentrations CYP1A2 inhibitors : In healthy subjects , co - administration of fluvoxamine , a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor , increased Cmax and AUC of pomalidomide by 24 % and 125 % respectively [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Increased pomalidomide exposure may increase the risk of exposure related toxicities .
Avoid co - administration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors ( e . g . ciprofloxacin and fluvoxamine ) .
If co - administration is unavoidable , reduce the POMALYST dose [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Lactation : Advise women not to breastfeed ( 8 . 2 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in females exposed to POMALYST during pregnancy as well as female partners of male patients who are exposed to POMALYST .
This registry is also used to understand the root cause for the pregnancy .
Report any suspected fetal exposure to POMALYST to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 and also to the REMS Call Center at 1 - 888 - 423 - 5436 .
Risk Summary Based on the mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] and findings from animal studies , POMALYST can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female and is contraindicated during pregnancy [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
POMALYST is a thalidomide analogue .
Thalidomide is a human teratogen , inducing a high frequency of severe and life - threatening birth defects such as amelia ( absence of limbs ) , phocomelia ( short limbs ) , hypoplasticity of the bones , absence of bones , external ear abnormalities ( including anotia , micropinna , small or absent external auditory canals ) , facial palsy , eye abnormalities ( anophthalmos , microphthalmos ) , and congenital heart defects .
Alimentary tract , urinary tract , and genital malformations have also been documented , and mortality at or shortly after birth has been reported in about 40 % of infants .
Pomalidomide was teratogenic in both rats and rabbits when administered during the period of organogenesis .
Pomalidomide crossed the placenta after administration to pregnant rabbits ( see Data ) .
If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential risk to a fetus .
If pregnancy does occur during treatment , immediately discontinue the drug .
Under these conditions , refer patient to an obstetrician / gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling .
Report any suspected fetal exposure to POMALYST to the FDA via the MedWatch program at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 and also to the REMS Call Center at 1 - 888 - 423 - 5436 .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
The estimated background risk in the U . S . general population of major birth defects is 2 % - 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 % - 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
Data Animal Data Pomalidomide was teratogenic in both rats and rabbits in the embryo - fetal developmental studies when administered during the period of organogenesis .
In rats , pomalidomide was administered orally to pregnant animals at doses of 25 to 1000 mg / kg / day .
Malformations or absence of urinary bladder , absence of thyroid gland , and fusion and misalignment of lumbar and thoracic vertebral elements ( vertebral , central , and / or neural arches ) were observed at all dose levels .
There was no maternal toxicity observed in this study .
The lowest dose in rats resulted in an exposure ( AUC ) approximately 85 - fold of the human exposure at the recommended dose of 4 mg / day .
Other embryo - fetal toxicities included increased resorptions leading to decreased number of viable fetuses .
In rabbits , pomalidomide was administered orally to pregnant animals at doses of 10 to 250 mg / kg / day .
Increased cardiac malformations such as interventricular septal defect were seen at all doses with significant increases at 250 mg / kg / day .
Additional malformations observed at 250 mg / kg / day included anomalies in limbs ( flexed and / or rotated fore - and / or hindlimbs , unattached or absent digit ) and associated skeletal malformations ( not ossified metacarpal , misaligned phalanx and metacarpal , absent digit , not ossified phalanx , and short not ossified or bent tibia ) , moderate dilation of the lateral ventricle in the brain , abnormal placement of the right subclavian artery , absent intermediate lobe in the lungs , low - set kidney , altered liver morphology , incompletely or not ossified pelvis , an increased average for supernumerary thoracic ribs , and a reduced average for ossified tarsals .
No maternal toxicity was observed at the low dose ( 10 mg / kg / day ) that resulted in cardiac anomalies in fetuses ; this dose resulted in an exposure ( AUC ) approximately equal to that reported in humans at the recommended dose of 4 mg / day .
Additional embryo - fetal toxicity included increased resorption .
Following daily oral administration of pomalidomide from Gestation Day 7 through Gestation Day 20 in pregnant rabbits , fetal plasma pomalidomide concentrations were approximately 50 % of the maternal Cmax at all dosages ( 5 to 250 mg / kg / day ) , indicating that pomalidomide crossed the placenta .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of pomalidomide in human milk , the effects of POMALYST on the breastfed child , or the effects of POMALYST on milk production .
Pomalidomide was excreted in the milk of lactating rats ( see Data ) .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions in a breastfed child from POMALYST , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with POMALYST .
Data Animal Data Following a single oral administration of pomalidomide to lactating rats approximately 14 days postpartum , pomalidomide was transferred into milk , with milk to plasma ratios of 0 . 63 to 1 . 46 .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing POMALYST can cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating POMALYST therapy and during therapy .
Advise females of reproductive potential that they must avoid pregnancy 4 weeks before therapy , while taking POMALYST , during dose interruptions and for at least 4 weeks after completing therapy .
Females of reproductive potential must have 2 negative pregnancy tests before initiating POMALYST .
The first test should be performed within 10 - 14 days , and the second test within 24 hours prior to prescribing POMALYST .
Once treatment has started and during dose interruptions , pregnancy testing for females of reproductive potential should occur weekly during the first 4 weeks of use , then pregnancy testing should be repeated every 4 weeks in females with regular menstrual cycles .
If menstrual cycles are irregular , the pregnancy testing should occur every 2 weeks .
Pregnancy testing and counseling should be performed if a patient misses her period or if there is any abnormality in her menstrual bleeding .
POMALYST treatment must be discontinued during this evaluation .
Contraception Females Females of reproductive potential must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use 2 methods of reliable birth control simultaneously : one highly effective form of contraception – tubal ligation , IUD , hormonal ( birth control pills , injections , hormonal patches , vaginal rings , or implants ) , or partner ' s vasectomy , and 1 additional effective contraceptive method – male latex or synthetic condom , diaphragm , or cervical cap .
Contraception must begin 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment with POMALYST , during therapy , during dose interruptions , and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of POMALYST therapy .
Reliable contraception is indicated even where there has been a history of infertility , unless due to hysterectomy .
Females of reproductive potential should be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods , if needed .
Males Pomalidomide is present in the semen of males who take POMALYST .
Therefore , males must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact with females of reproductive potential while taking POMALYST and for up to 4 weeks after discontinuing POMALYST , even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy .
Male patients taking POMALYST must not donate sperm .
Infertility Based on findings in animals , female fertility may be compromised by treatment with POMALYST [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of POMALYST have not been established in pediatric patients .
The safety and effectiveness were assessed but not established in two open - label studies : a dose escalation study in 25 pediatric patients aged 5 to < 17 with recurrent , progressive or refractory CNS tumors [ NCT02415153 ] and a parallel - group study conducted in 47 pediatric patients aged 4 to < 17 years with recurrent or progressive high - grade glioma , medulloblastoma , ependymoma , or diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) [ NCT03257631 ] .
No new safety signals were observed in pediatric patients across these studies .
At the same dose by body surface area , pomalidomide exposure in 55 pediatric patients aged 4 to < 17 years old was within the range observed in adult patients with MM but higher than the exposure observed in adult patients with KS [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Multiple Myeloma Of the total number of patients in clinical studies of POMALYST , 44 % were aged older than 65 years , while 10 % were aged older than 75 years .
No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients .
In these studies , patients older than 65 years were more likely than patients less than or equal to 65 years of age to experience pneumonia .
Kaposi Sarcoma Of the 28 patients who received POMALYST , 11 % were 65 years or older , and 3 . 6 % were 75 years of age or older .
The clinical study did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment In patients with severe renal impairment requiring dialysis , the AUC of pomalidomide increased by 38 % and the rate of SAE increased by 64 % relative to patients with normal renal function ; therefore , starting dose adjustment is recommended .
For patients with severe renal impairment requiring dialysis , administer POMALYST after the completion of hemodialysis on dialysis days because exposure of pomalidomide could be significantly decreased during dialysis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Pomalidomide is metabolized primarily by the liver .
Following single dose administration , the AUC of pomalidomide increased 51 % , 58 % , and 72 % in subjects with mild ( Child - Pugh class A ) , moderate ( Child - Pugh class B ) , and severe ( Child - Pugh class C ) hepatic impairment , respectively compared to subjects with normal liver function .
Dose adjustment is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 8 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 8 Smoking Tobacco Cigarette smoking reduces pomalidomide AUC due to CYP1A2 induction .
Advise patients that smoking may reduce the efficacy of pomalidomide [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Hemodialysis can remove pomalidomide from circulation .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Pomalidomide is an analogue of thalidomide with immunomodulatory , antiangiogenic , and antineoplastic properties .
Cellular activities of pomalidomide are mediated through its target cereblon , a component of a cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme complex .
In vitro , in the presence of drug , substrate proteins ( including Aiolos and Ikaros ) are targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation leading to direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects .
In in vitro cellular assays , pomalidomide inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of hematopoietic tumor cells .
Additionally , pomalidomide inhibited the proliferation of lenalidomide - resistant multiple myeloma ( MM ) cell lines and synergized with dexamethasone in both lenalidomide - sensitive and lenalidomide - resistant cell lines to induce tumor cell apoptosis .
Pomalidomide enhanced T cell - and natural killer ( NK ) cell - mediated immunity and inhibited production of pro - inflammatory cytokines ( e . g . , TNF - α and IL - 6 ) by monocytes .
Pomalidomide demonstrated anti - angiogenic activity in a mouse tumor model and in the in vitro umbilical cord model .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Pomalidomide exposure - response analyses showed that there was no relationship between systemic pomalidomide exposure level and efficacy or safety following pomalidomide dose of 4 mg .
Cardiac Electrophysiology The QTc prolongation potential of pomalidomide was evaluated in a single center , randomized , double - blind crossover study ( N = 72 ) using 4 mg pomalidomide , 20 mg pomalidomide , placebo , and 400 mg moxifloxacin ( positive control ) .
No significant QTc prolongation effect of pomalidomide was observed following pomalidomide doses of 4 and 20 mg .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In patients with MM who received POMALYST 4 mg daily alone or in combination with dexamethasone , pomalidomide steady - state drug exposure was characterized by AUC ( CV % ) of 860 ( 37 % ) ng ∙ h / mL and Cmax ( CV % ) of 75 ( 32 % ) ng / mL .
In patients with Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) who received POMALYST 5 mg daily , pomalidomide steady - state drug exposure was characterized by AUC of 462 . 3 ng ∙ h / mL ( 82 % ) and Cmax of 53 . 1 ng / mL ( 50 % ) .
Absorption Following administration of single oral doses of POMALYST , the maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) for pomalidomide occurs at 2 to 3 hours postdose in patients with MM or KS .
Effect of Food Co - administration of POMALYST with a high - fat meal ( approximately 50 % of the total caloric content ) and high - calorie meal ( approximately 800 to 1000 calories ) ( the meal contained approximately 150 , 250 , and 500 to 600 calories from protein , carbohydrates , and fat , respectively ) delays the Tmax by 2 . 5 hours , decreased mean plasma Cmax and AUC in healthy subjects by about 27 % and 8 % , respectively .
Distribution Pomalidomide has a mean apparent volume of distribution ( Vd / F ) between 62 and 138 L at steady state in patients with MM or KS .
Pomalidomide is distributed in semen of healthy subjects at a concentration of approximately 67 % of plasma level at 4 hours postdose ( ~ Tmax ) after 4 days of 2 mg once - daily dosing .
Human plasma protein binding of pomalidomide ranges from 12 % to 44 % and is not concentration dependent .
Pomalidomide is a substrate for P - gp .
Elimination Pomalidomide has a mean total body clearance ( CL / F ) of 7 - 10 L / h in patients with MM or KS .
Pomalidomide is eliminated with a median plasma half - life of 9 . 5 hours in healthy subjects and 7 . 5 hours in patients with MM or KS .
Metabolism Pomalidomide is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 .
Minor contributions from CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 were also observed in vitro .
Excretion Following a single oral administration of [ 14 C ] - pomalidomide to healthy subjects , approximately 73 % and 15 % of the radioactive dose was eliminated in urine and feces , respectively , with approximately 2 % and 8 % of the radiolabeled dose eliminated unchanged as pomalidomide in urine and feces .
Specific Populations Age ( 61 to 85 years old ) , sex and race have no clinically significant effect on the systemic exposure of pomalidomide .
Patients with Renal Impairment Pomalidomide pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly affected in patients with moderate ( 30 mL / min ≤ CLcr < 60 mL / min ) or severe ( 15 mL / min ≤ CLcr < 30 mL / min ) renal impairment relative to patients with normal renal function ( CLcr ≥ 60 mL / min ) .
Mean exposure ( AUC ) to pomalidomide increased by 38 % in patients with severe renal impairment requiring dialysis ( CLcr < 30 mL / min requiring dialysis ) and 40 % in patients with end stage renal disease ( CLcr < 15 mL / min ) on non - dialysis days .
In patients with severe renal impairment requiring dialysis , the estimated dialysis clearance is approximately 12 L / h which is higher than pomalidomide total body clearance , indicating hemodialysis will remove pomalidomide from the blood circulation .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Mean exposure ( AUC ) of pomalidomide increased by 51 % , 58 % and 72 % in subjects with mild , moderate or severe hepatic impairment as defined by Child - Pugh criteria , respectively .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Co - administration of POMALYST with the following drugs did not increase pomalidomide exposure to a clinically significant extent : ketoconazole ( a strong CYP3A4 and P - gp inhibitor ) , carbamazepine ( a strong CYP3A4 inducer ) and dexamethasone ( a weak to moderate CYP3A4 inducer ) .
Co - administration of POMALYST with drugs that are CYP1A2 inducers has not been studied .
CYP1A2 Inhibitors : Co - administration of fluvoxamine ( a strong CYP1A2 inhibitor ) with POMALYST increased mean [ 90 % confidence interval ] pomalidomide exposure by 125 % [ 98 % to 157 % ] compared to POMALYST alone in healthy subjects .
Co - administration of fluvoxamine in the presence of ketoconazole ( a strong CYP3A4 and P - gp inhibitor ) with POMALYST increased mean pomalidomide exposure by 146 % [ 126 % to 167 % ] compared to POMALYST administered alone in healthy subjects , indicating the predominant effect of CYP1A2 inhibition in the increase of pomalidomide exposure [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Strong CYP3A4 and P - gp Inhibitors : Co - administration of ketoconazole ( a strong CYP3A4 and P - gp inhibitor ) in 16 healthy male subjects increased AUC of pomalidomide by 19 % compared to POMALYST administered alone .
Strong CYP1A2 Inducers : Co - administration of POMALYST with drugs that are CYP1A2 inducers has not been studied and may reduce pomalidomide exposure .
Strong CYP3A4 Inducers : Co - administration of carbamazepine to 16 healthy male subjects decreased AUC of pomalidomide by 20 % with a 90 % confidence interval [ 13 % to 27 % ] compared to when pomalidomide was administered alone .
Dexamethasone : Co - administration of multiple doses of 4 mg POMALYST with 20 mg to 40 mg dexamethasone ( a weak to moderate inducer of CYP3A4 ) to patients with MM had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide compared to when pomalidomide was administered alone .
Smoking : In 14 healthy male subjects who smoked 25 cigarettes per day for a total of 10 days , after single oral dose of 4 mg POMALYST , Cmax of pomalidomide increased 14 % while AUC of pomalidomide decreased 32 % , compared to that in 13 healthy male subjects who were non - smokers .
In Vitro Studies Pomalidomide does not inhibit or induce cytochrome p450 enzymes or transporters in vitro .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Studies examining the carcinogenic potential of pomalidomide have not been conducted .
One of 12 monkeys dosed with 1 mg / kg of pomalidomide ( an exposure approximately 15 - fold of the exposure in patients at the recommended dose of 4 mg / day ) developed acute myeloid leukemia in a 9 - month repeat - dose toxicology study .
Pomalidomide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of tests , including the bacteria reverse mutation assay ( Ames test ) , the in vitro assay using human peripheral blood lymphocytes , and the micronucleus test in orally treated rats administered doses up to 2000 mg / kg / day .
In a fertility and early embryonic development study in rats , drug - treated males were mated with untreated or treated females .
Pomalidomide was administered to males and females at doses of 25 to 1000 mg / kg / day .
When treated males were mated with treated females , there was an increase in post - implantation loss and a decrease in mean number of viable embryos at all dose levels .
There were no other effects on reproductive functions or the number of pregnancies .
The lowest dose tested in animals resulted in an exposure ( AUC ) approximately 100 - fold of the exposure in patients at the recommended dose of 4 mg / day .
When treated males in this study were mated with untreated females , all uterine parameters were comparable to the controls .
Based on these results , the observed effects were attributed to the treatment of females .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Multiple Myeloma Trial 1 Trial 1 was a phase 2 , multicenter , randomized open - label study in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma ( MM ) who were refractory to their last myeloma therapy and had received lenalidomide and bortezomib .
Patients were considered relapsed if they had achieved at least stable disease for at least 1 cycle of treatment to at least 1 prior regimen and then developed progressive disease .
Patients were considered refractory if they experienced disease progression on or within 60 days of their last therapy .
A total of 221 patients were randomized to receive POMALYST alone or POMALYST with Low - dose Dex .
In Trial 1 , the safety and efficacy of POMALYST 4 mg , once daily for 21 of 28 days , until disease progression , were evaluated alone and in combination with Low - dose Dex ( 40 mg / day given only on Days 1 , 8 , 15 , and 22 of each 28 - day cycle for patients aged 75 years or younger , or 20 mg / day given only on Days 1 , 8 , 15 , and 22 of each 28 - day cycle for patients aged greater than 75 years ) .
Patients in the POMALYST alone arm were allowed to add Low - dose Dex upon disease progression .
Table 7 summarizes the baseline patient and disease characteristics in Trial 1 .
The baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced and comparable between the study arms .
