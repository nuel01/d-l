125 mg / 5 mL and 250 mg / 5 mL Rx only To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of cefdinir for oral suspension and other antibacterial drugs , cefdinir for oral suspension should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria .
DESCRIPTION Cefdinir for oral suspension contains the active ingredient cefdinir , an extended - spectrum , semisynthetic cephalosporin , for oral administration .
Chemically , cefdinir is [ 6 R - [ 6α , 7β ( Z ) ] ] - 7 - [ [ ( 2 - amino - 4 - thiazolyl ) ( hydroxyimino ) acetyl ] amino ] - 3 - ethenyl - 8 - oxo - 5 - thia - 1 - azabicyclo [ 4 . 2 . 0 ] oct - 2 - ene - 2 - carboxylic acid .
Cefdinir is a white to slightly brownish - yellow solid .
It is slightly soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid and sparingly soluble in 0 . 1 M pH 7 . 0 phosphate buffer .
The molecular formula is C14H13N5O5S2 and the molecular weight is 395 . 42 .
Cefdinir has the structural formula shown below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Cefdinir Cefdinir for oral suspension , after reconstitution , contains 125 mg cefdinir per 5 mL or 250 mg cefdinir per 5 mL and the following inactive ingredients : anhydrous citric acid ; colloidal silicon dioxide ; guar gum ; anhydrous sodium citrate ; sodium benzoate ; strawberry flavour ; sucrose ; and xanthan gum .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] INDICATIONS AND USAGE To reduce the development of drug - resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of cefdinir for oral suspension and other antibacterial drugs , cefdinir for oral suspension should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria .
When culture and susceptibility information are available , they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy .
In the absence of such data , local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy .
Cefdinir for oral suspension is indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the conditions listed below .
Adults and Adolescents : Enter section text here Pediatric Patients : Enter section text here CONTRAINDICATIONS Cefdinir is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to the cephalosporin class of antibiotics .
WARNINGS BEFORE THERAPY WITH CEFDINIR IS INSTITUTED , CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PATIENT HAS HAD PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO CEFDINIR , OTHER CEPHALOSPORINS , PENICILLINS , OR OTHER DRUGS .
IF CEFDINIR IS TO BE GIVEN TO PENICILLIN - SENSITIVE PATIENTS , CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED BECAUSE CROSS - HYPERSENSITIVITY AMONG β - LACTAM ANTIBIOTICS HAS BEEN CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND MAY OCCUR IN UP TO 10 % OF PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN ALLERGY .
IF AN ALLERGIC REACTION TO CEFDINIR OCCURS , THE DRUG SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED .
SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES , INCLUDING OXYGEN , INTRAVENOUS FLUIDS , INTRAVENOUS ANTIHISTAMINES , CORTICOSTEROIDS , PRESSOR AMINES , AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT , AS CLINICALLY INDICATED .
Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including cefdinir , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibiotic treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
OVERDOSAGE Information on cefdinir overdosage in humans is not available .
In acute rodent toxicity studies , a single oral 5600 mg / kg dose produced no adverse effects .
Toxic signs and symptoms following overdosage with other β - lactam antibiotics have included nausea , vomiting , epigastric distress , diarrhea , and convulsions .
Hemodialysis removes cefdinir from the body .
This may be useful in the event of a serious toxic reaction from overdosage , particularly if renal function is compromised .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( see INDICATIONS AND USAGE for Indicated Pathogens ) The recommended dosage and duration of treatment for infections in pediatric patients are described in the following chart ; the total daily dose for all infections is 14 mg / kg , up to a maximum dose of 600 mg per day .
Once - daily dosing for 10 days is as effective as BID dosing .
Once - daily dosing has not been studied in skin infections ; therefore , cefdinir for oral suspension should be administered twice daily in this infection .
Cefdinir for oral suspension may be administered without regard to meals .
Pediatric Patients ( Age 6 Months Through 12 Years ) Type of Infection Dosage Duration Acute Bacterial Otitis Media 7 mg / kg q12h or 5 to 10 days 14 mg / kg q24h 10 days Acute Maxillary Sinusitis 7 mg / kg q12h or 10 days 14 mg / kg q24h 10 days Pharyngitis / Tonsilitis 7 mg / kg q12h or 5 to 10 days 14 mg / kg q24h 10 days Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections 7 mg / kg q12h 10 days CEFDINIR FOR ORAL SUSPENSION PEDIATRIC DOSAGE CHARTWeight 125 mg / 5 mL 250 mg / 5 mL 9 kg / 20 lbs 2 . 5 mL q12h or 5 mL q24h Use 125 mg / 5 mL product 18 kg / 40 lbs 5 mL q12h or 10 mL q24h 2 . 5 mL q12h or 5 mL q24h 27 kg / 60 lbs 7 . 5 mL q12h or 15 mL q24h 3 . 75 mL q12h or 7 . 5 mL q24h 36 kg / 80 lbs 10 mL q12h or 20 mL q24h 5 mL q12h or 10 mL q24h ≥ 43 kg a / 95 lbs 12 mL q12h or 24 mL q24h 6 mL q12h or 12 mL q24h a Pediatric patients who weight ≥ 43 kg should receive the maximum daily dose of 600 mg . Patients With Renal Insufficiency : For adult patients with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL / min , the dose of cefdinir should be 300 mg given once daily .
Creatinine clearance is difficult to measure in outpatients .
However , the following formula may be used to estimate creatinine clearance ( CLcr ) in adult patients .
For estimates to be valid , serum creatinine levels should reflect steady - state levels of renal function .
( weight ) ( 140 – age ) Males : CLcr = ———————————— ( 72 ) ( serum creatinine ) Females : CLcr = 0 . 85 x above value where creatinine clearance is in mL / min , age is in years , weight is in kilograms , and serum creatinine is in mg / dL .
( 3 ) The following formula may be used to estimate creatinine clearance in pediatric patients : body length or height CLcr = K x ——————————— serum creatinine where K = 0 . 55 for pediatric patients older than 1 year ( 4 ) and 0 . 45 for infants ( up to 1 year ) ( 5 ) .
In the above equation , creatinine clearance is in mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 , body length or height is in centimeters , and serum creatinine is in mg / dL .
For pediatric patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 , the dose of cefdinir should be 7 mg / kg ( up to 300 mg ) given once daily .
Patients on Hemodialysis : Hemodialysis removes cefdinir from the body .
In patients maintained on chronic hemodialysis , the recommended initial dosage regimen is a 300 mg or 7 mg / kg dose every other day .
At the conclusion of each hemodialysis session , 300 mg ( or 7 mg / kg ) should be given .
Subsequent doses ( 300 mg or 7 mg / kg ) are then administered every other day .
