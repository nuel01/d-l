Rx Only Pharmacy Bulk Package Not for Direct Infusion DESCRIPTION PREMASOL 10 % injection is a sterile , nonpyrogenic , hypertonic solutions containing crystalline amino acids provided in a Pharmacy Bulk Package .
A Pharmacy Bulk Package is a container of a sterile preparation for parenteral use that contains many single doses .
The contents are intended for use in a pharmacy admixture program and are restricted to the preparation of admixtures for intravenous infusion .
The VIAFLEX plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinyl chloride ( PL 146 Plastic ) .
Exposure to temperatures above 25 ° C / 77 ° F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content .
Higher temperatures lead to greater losses .
It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period .
The amount of water that can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period ( e . g . , di - 2 - ethylhexyl phthalate , DEHP , at not more than 0 . 2 part per million ) ; however , the safety of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies .
Intravenous fat emulsion should not be administered in polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) containers that use di - 2 - ethylhexyl phthalate ( DEHP ) as a plasticizer , because the fat emulsion facilitates the leaching of DEHP from these containers .
Each 100 mL contains : Essential Amino Acids 10 % Leucine - ( CH3 ) 2 CHCH2CH ( NH2 ) COOH 1 . 4 g Isoleucine - CH3CH2CH ( CH3 ) CH ( NH2 ) COOH 0 . 82 g Lysine ( added as Lysine Acetate ) - H2N ( CH2 ) 4 CH ( NH2 ) COOH 0 . 82 g Valine - ( CH3 ) 2 CHCH ( NH2 ) COOH 0 . 78 g Histidine [ 1 ] - ( C3H3N2 ) CH2CH ( NH2 ) COOH 0 . 48 g Phenylalanine - ( C6H5 ) CH2 CH ( NH2 ) COOH 0 . 48 g Threonine - CH3CH ( OH ) CH ( NH2 ) COOH 0 . 42 g Methionine - CH3S ( CH2 ) 2 CH ( NH2 ) COOH 0 . 34 g Tyrosine null ( added as Tyrosine and N - Acetyl - L - Tyrosine ) - [ C6H4 ( OH ) ] CH2CH ( NH2 ) COOH 0 . 24 g Tryptophan - ( C8H6N ) CH2CH ( NH2 ) COOH 0 . 20 g Cysteine ( added as Cysteine HCl · H2O ) - SHCH2 CHNH2 COOH < 0 . 016 g Nonessential Amino Acids Arginine - H2NC ( NH ) NH ( CH2 ) 3 CH ( NH2 ) COOH 1 . 2 g Proline – [ ( CH2 ) 3 NHCH ] COOH 0 . 68 g Alanine – CH3CH ( NH2 ) COOH 0 . 54 g Glutamic Acid – HOOC ( CH2 ) 2 CH ( NH2 ) COOH 0 . 50 g Serine - HOCH2 CH ( NH2 ) COOH 0 . 38 g Glycine - H2NCH2COOH 0 . 36 g Aspartic Acid – HOOC CH2 CH ( NH2 ) COOH 0 . 32 g Taurine [ 2 ] [ 3 ] - H2NCH2CH2SO3H 0 . 025 g pH adjusted with glacial acetic acid pH : 5 . 5 ( 5 . 0 - 6 . 0 ) Osmolarity ( mOsmol / L ) ( Calc . )

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY PREMASOL 10 % injection provides a mixture of essential and nonessential amino acids as well as taurine and a soluble form of tyrosine , N - Acetyl - L - Tyrosine ( NAT ) .
This amino acid composition has been specifically formulated to provide a well tolerated nitrogen source for nutritional support and therapy for infants and young children .
When administered in conjunction with cysteine hydrochloride , 10 % Amino Acid Injections result in the normalization of the plasma amino acid concentrations to a profile consistent with that of a breast - fed infant .
The rationale for a 10 % amino acids injection is based on the observation of inadequate levels of essential amino acids in the plasma of infants receiving total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) using conventional amino acid solutions .
These formulas were developed through the application of specific pharmacokinetic multiple regression analysis relating amino acid intake to the resulting plasma amino acid concentrations .
Clinical studies in infants and young children who required TPN therapy showed that infusion of a 10 % amino acids injection with a cysteine hydrochloride admixture resulted in a normalization of the plasma amino acid concentrations .
In addition , weight gains , nitrogen balance , and serum protein concentrations were consistent with an improving nutritional status .
When infused with hypertonic dextrose as a calorie source , supplemented with cysteine hydrochloride , electrolytes , vitamins , and minerals , PREMASOL 10 % injection provides total parenteral nutrition in infants and young children , with the exception of essential fatty acids .
It is thought that the acetate from lysine acetate and acetic acid , under the conditions of parenteral nutrition , does not impact net acid - base balance when renal and respiratory functions are normal .
Clinical evidence seems to support this thinking ; however , confirmatory experimental evidence is not available .
The amount of chloride present in PREMASOL 10 % injection is not of clinical significance .
The addition of cysteine hydrochloride will contribute to the chloride load .
The electrolyte content of any additives that are introduced should be carefully considered and included in total input computations .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE PREMASOL 10 % injection is indicated for the nutritional support of infants ( including those of low birth weight ) and young children requiring TPN via either central or peripheral infusion routes .
Parenteral nutrition with PREMASOL 10 % injection is indicated to prevent nitrogen and weight loss or treat negative nitrogen balance in infants and young children where : ( 1 ) the alimentary tract , by the oral , gastrostomy , or jejunostomy route , cannot or should not be used , or adequate protein intake is not feasible by these routes ; ( 2 ) gastrointestinal absorption of protein is impaired ; or ( 3 ) protein requirements are substantially increased as with extensive burns .
Dosage , route of administration , and concomitant infusion of non - protein calories are dependent on various factors , such as nutritional and metabolic status of the patient , anticipated duration of parenteral nutritional support , and vein tolerance ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Central Venous Nutrition Central venous infusion should be considered when amino acid solutions are to be admixed with hypertonic dextrose to promote protein synthesis in hypercatabolic or severely depleted infants , or those requiring long - term parenteral nutrition .
Peripheral Parenteral Nutrition For moderately catabolic or depleted patients in whom the central venous route is not indicated , diluted amino acid solutions mixed with 5 - 10 % dextrose solutions may be infused by peripheral vein , supplemented , if desired , with fat emulsion .
CONTRAINDICATIONS PREMASOL 10 % injection is contraindicated in patients with untreated anuria , hepatic coma , inborn errors of amino acid metabolism , including those involving branched chain amino acid metabolism such as maple syrup urine disease and isovaleric acidemia , or hypersensitivity to one or more amino acids present in the solution .
WARNINGS This injection is for compounding only , not for direct infusion .
Safe , effective use of parenteral nutrition requires a knowledge of nutrition as well as clinical expertise in recognition and treatment of the complications which can occur .
Frequent evaluation and laboratory determinations are necessary for proper monitoring of parenteral nutrition .
Studies should include blood sugar , serum proteins , kidney and liver function tests , electrolytes , hemogram , carbon dioxide content , serum osmolalities , blood cultures , and blood ammonia levels .
Administration of amino acids in the presence of impaired renal function or gastrointestinal bleeding may augment an already elevated blood urea nitrogen .
Patients with azotemia from any cause should not be infused with amino acids without regard to total nitrogen intake .
Administration of intravenous solutions can cause fluid and / or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states , or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the solutions .
The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the solutions .
Administration of amino acid solutions to a patient with hepatic insufficiency may result in plasma amino acid imbalances , hyperammonemia , prerenal azotemia , stupor and coma .
Hyperammonemia is of special significance in infants as its occurrence in the syndrome caused by genetic metabolic defects is sometimes associated , although not necessarily in a causal relationship , with mental retardation .
This reaction appears to be dose related and is more likely to develop during prolonged therapy .
It is essential that blood ammonia be measured frequently in infants .
The mechanisms of this reaction are not clearly defined but may involve genetic defects and immature or subclinically impaired liver function .
Conservative doses of amino acids should be given , dictated by the nutritional status of the patient .
Should symptoms of hyperammonemia develop , amino acid administration should be discontinued and patient ' s clinical status reevaluated .
WARNING : This product contains aluminum that may be toxic .
Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired .
Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature , and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions , which contain aluminum .
Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function , including premature neonates , who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 µg / kg / day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity .
Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration .
PRECAUTIONS General Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance , electrolyte concentrations , and acid - base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation .
Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require the use of additional electrolyte supplements .
Strongly hypertonic nutrient solutions should be administered via an intravenous catheter placed in a central vein , preferably the superior vena cava .
Care should be taken to avoid circulatory overload , particularly in patients with cardiac insufficiency .
Special care must be taken when giving hypertonic dextrose to a diabetic or pre - diabetic patient .
To prevent severe hyperglycemia in such patients , insulin may be required .
Administration of glucose at a rate exceeding the patient ' s utilization rate may lead to hyperglycemia , coma , and death .
Administration of amino acids without carbohydrates may result in the accumulation of ketone bodies in the blood .
Correction of this ketonemia may be achieved by the administration of carbohydrates .
Peripheral administration of PREMASOL 10 % injection requires appropriate dilution and provision of adequate calories .
Care should be taken to assure proper placement of the needle within the lumen of the vein .
The venipuncture site should be inspected frequently for signs of infiltration .
If venous thrombosis or phlebitis occurs , discontinue infusions or change infusion site and initiate appropriate treatment .
Extraordinary electrolyte losses such as may occur during protracted nasogastric suction , vomiting , diarrhea , or gastrointestinal fistula drainage may necessitate additional electrolyte supplementation .
Metabolic acidosis can be prevented or readily controlled by adding a portion of the cations in the electrolyte mixture as acetate salts and in the case of hyperchloremic acidosis , by keeping the total chloride content of the infusate to a minimum .
PREMASOL 10 % injection contains less than 3 mEq chloride per liter .
PREMASOL 10 % injection contains no added phosphorus .
Patients , especially those with hypophosphatemia , may require the addition of phosphate .
To prevent hypocalcemia , calcium supplementation should always accompany phosphate administration .
To assure adequate intake , serum levels should be monitored frequently .
To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing this solution with other additives that may be prescribed , the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing , prior to administration , and periodically during administration .
Do not use unless solution is clear and seal is intact .
Drug product contains no more than 25 µg / L of aluminum .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No in vitro or in vivo carcinogenesis , mutagenesis , or fertility studies have been conducted with PREMASOL 10 % injection .
Usage in Pregnancy Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with PREMASOL 10 % injection .
It is also not known whether PREMASOL 10 % injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Special Precautions for Central Venous Nutrition Administration by central venous catheter should be used only by those familiar with this technique and its complications .
Central venous nutrition may be associated with complications which can be prevented or minimized by careful attention to all aspects of the procedure , including solution preparation , administration , and patient monitoring .
It is essential that a carefully prepared protocol , based on current medical practices , be followed , preferably by an experienced team .
Although a detailed discussion of the complications is beyond the scope of this insert , the following summary lists those based on current literature .
Technical .
The placement of a central venous catheter should be regarded as a surgical procedure .
One should be fully acquainted with various techniques of catheter insertion as well as recognition and treatment of complications .
For details of techniques and placement sites , consult the medical literature .
X - ray is the best means of verifying catheter placement .
Complications known to occur from the placement of central venous catheters are pneumothorax , hemothorax , hydrothorax , artery puncture and transection , injury to the brachial plexus , malposition of the catheter , formation of arteriovenous fistula , phlebitis , thrombosis , and air and catheter embolus .
Septic .
The constant risk of sepsis is present during central venous nutrition .
Since contaminated solutions and infusion catheters are potential sources of infection , it is imperative that the preparation of parenteral nutrition solutions and the placement and care of catheters be accomplished under controlled aseptic conditions .
Solutions should ideally be prepared in the hospital pharmacy in a laminar flow hood .
The key factor in their preparation is careful aseptic technique to avoid inadvertent touch contamination during mixing of solutions and subsequent admixtures .
Parenteral nutrition solutions should be used promptly after mixing .
Any storage should be under refrigeration and limited to a brief period of time , preferably less than 24 hours .
Consult the medical literature for a discussion of the management of sepsis during central venous nutrition .
In brief , typical management includes replacing the solution being administered with a fresh container and set , and the remaining contents are cultured for bacterial or fungal contamination .
If sepsis persists and another source of infection is not identified , the catheter is removed , the proximal tip cultured , and a new catheter reinserted when the fever has subsided .
Non - specific , prophylactic antibiotic treatment is not recommended .
Clinical experience indicates that the catheter is likely to be the prime source of infection as opposed to aseptically prepared and properly stored solutions .
Metabolic .
The following metabolic complications have been reported : metabolic acidosis , hypophosphatemia , alkalosis , hyperglycemia and glycosuria , osmotic diuresis and dehydration , rebound hypoglycemia , elevated liver enzymes , hypo - and hypervitaminosis , electrolyte imbalances , and hyperammonemia in children .
Frequent clinical evaluation and laboratory determinations are necessary , especially during the first few days of venous nutrition , to prevent or minimize these complications .
ADVERSE REACTIONS See WARNINGS and Special Precautions for Central Venous Nutrition .
Reactions reported in clinical studies as a result of infusion of the parenteral fluid were water weight gain , edema , increase in BUN , and mild acidosis .
Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response , infection at the site of injection , venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection , extravasation , and hypervolemia .
Local reaction at the infusion site , consisting of a warm sensation , erythema , phlebitis and thrombosis , have been reported with peripheral amino acid infusions , especially if other substances are also administered through the same site .
If electrolyte supplementation is required during peripheral infusion , it is recommended that additives be administered throughout the day in order to avoid possible venous irritation .
Irritating additive medications may require injection at another site and should not be added directly to the amino acid infusate .
Symptoms may result from an excess or deficit of one or more of the ions present in the solution ; therefore , frequent monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential .
Phosphorus deficiency may lead to impaired tissue oxygenation and acute hemolytic anemia .
Relative to calcium , excessive phosphorus intake can precipitate hypocalcemia with cramps , tetany and muscular hyperexcitability .
If an adverse reaction does occur , discontinue the infusion , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures , and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of a fluid or solute overload during parenteral therapy , reevaluate the patient ' s condition , and institute appropriate corrective treatment .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The objective of nutritional management of infants and young children is the provision of sufficient amino acid and caloric support for protein synthesis and growth .
The total daily dose of PREMASOL 10 % injection depends on daily protein requirements and on the patient ' s metabolic and clinical response .
The determination of nitrogen balance and accurate daily body weights , corrected for fluid balance , are probably the best means of assessing individual protein requirements .
Dosage should also be guided by the patient ' s fluid intake limits and glucose and nitrogen tolerances , as well as by metabolic and clinical response .
Recommendations for allowances of protein in infant nutrition have ranged from 2 to 4 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day ( 2 . 0 to 4 . 0 g / kg / day ) [ 1 ] .
The recommended dosage of PREMASOL 10 % injection is 2 . 0 to 2 . 5 grams of amino acids per kilogram of body weight per day ( 2 . 0 to 2 . 5 g / kg / day ) for infants up to 10 kilograms .
For infants and young children larger than 10 kilograms , the total dosage of amino acids should include the 20 to 25 grams / day for the first 10 kg of body weight plus 1 . 0 to 1 . 25 g / day for each kg of body weight over 10 kilograms .
Typically , PREMASOL 10 % injection is admixed with 50 % or 70 % Dextrose Injection USP supplemented with electrolytes and vitamins and administered continuously over a 24 hour period .
Total daily fluid intake should be appropriate for the patient ' s age and size .
A fluid dose of 125 mL per kilogram body weight per day is appropriate for most infants on TPN .
Although nitrogen requirements may be higher in severely hypercatabolic or depleted patients , provision of additional nitrogen may not be possible due to fluid intake limits , nitrogen , or glucose intolerance .
Cysteine is considered to be an essential amino acid in infants and young children .
An admixture of cysteine hydrochloride to the TPN solution is therefore recommended .
Based on clinical studies , the recommended dosage is 1 . 0 mmol of L - cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate per kilogram of body weight per day .
In many patients , provision of adequate calories in the form of hypertonic dextrose may require the administration of exogenous insulin to prevent hyperglycemia and glycosuria .
To prevent rebound hypoglycemia , a solution containing 5 % dextrose should be administered when hypertonic dextrose solutions are abruptly discontinued .
Fat emulsion coadministration should be considered when prolonged ( more than 5 days ) parenteral nutrition is required in order to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency ( EFAD ) .
Serum lipids should be monitored for evidence of EFAD in patients maintained on fat free TPN .
The provision of sufficient intracellular electrolytes , principally potassium , magnesium , and phosphate , is required for optimum utilization of amino acids .
In addition , sufficient quantities of the major extracellular electrolytes sodium , calcium , and chloride , must be given .
In patients with hyperchloremic or other metabolic acidosis , sodium and potassium may be added as the acetate salts to provide bicarbonate precursor .
The electrolyte content of PREMASOL 10 % injection must be considered when calculating daily electrolyte intake .
Serum electrolytes , including magnesium and phosphorus , should be monitored frequently .
Appropriate vitamins , minerals and trace elements should also be provided .

Central Venous Nutrition .
Hypertonic mixtures of amino acids and dextrose may be safely administered by continuous infusion through a central venous catheter with the tip located in the superior vena cava .
Initial infusion rates should be slow , and gradually increased to the recommended 60 - 125 mL per kilogram of body weight per day .
If administration rate should fall behind schedule , no attempt to “ catch up ” to planned intake should be made .
In addition to meeting protein needs , the rate of administration , particularly during the first few days of therapy , is governed by the patient ' s glucose tolerance .
Daily intake of amino acids and dextrose should be increased gradually to the maximum required dose as indicated by frequent determinations of glucose levels in blood and urine .
Peripheral Parenteral Nutrition .
For patients in whom the central venous route is not indicated and who can consume adequate calories enterally , PREMASOL 10 % injection may be administered by peripheral vein with or without parenteral carbohydrate calories .
Such infusates can be prepared by dilution with Sterile Water for Injection or 5 % - 10 % Dextrose Injection to prepare isotonic or slightly hypertonic solutions for peripheral infusion .
It is essential that peripheral infusion be accompanied by adequate caloric intake .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
A slight yellow color does not alter the quality and efficacy of the product .
PREMASOL 10 % injection may be admixed with solutions which contain phosphate or which have been supplemented with phosphate .
The presence of calcium and magnesium ions in an additive solution should be considered when phosphate is also present , in order to avoid precipitation .
Care must be taken to avoid incompatible admixtures .
Consult with pharmacist .
Parenteral nutrition solutions should be used promptly after mixing .
Any storage should be under refrigeration and limited to a brief period of time , preferably less than 24 hours .
