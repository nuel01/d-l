6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The data in Table 1 are derived from 9 primary hyperlipidemia placebo - controlled trials that included 2476 patients treated with PRALUENT 75 mg and / or 150 mg every 2 weeks , including 2135 exposed for 6 months and 1999 exposed for more than 1 year ( median treatment duration of 65 weeks ) .
The mean age of the population was 59 years , 40 % of the population were women , 90 % were White , 4 % were Black or African American , and 3 % were Asian .
Adverse reactions reported in at least 2 % of PRALUENT - treated patients , and more frequently than in placebo - treated patients , are shown in Table 1 .
Table 1 : Adverse Reactions Occurring in > 2 % of PRALUENT - Treated Patients and More Frequently Than with PlaceboAdverse Reactions Placebo ( N = 1276 ) % PRALUENT [ 1 ] ( N = 2476 ) % Nasopharyngitis 11 . 1 11 . 3 Injection site reactions [ 2 ] 5 . 1 7 . 2 Influenza 4 . 6 5 . 7 Urinary tract infection 4 . 6 4 . 8 Diarrhea 4 . 4 4 . 7 Bronchitis 3 . 8 4 . 3 Myalgia 3 . 4 4 . 2 Muscle spasms 2 . 4 3 . 1 Sinusitis 2 . 7 3 . 0 Cough 2 . 3 2 . 5 Contusion 1 . 3 2 . 1 Musculoskeletal pain 1 . 6 2 . 1 [ 1 ] 75 mg every 2 weeks and 150 mg every 2 weeks combined [ 2 ] Includes erythema / redness , itching , swelling , pain / tenderness Adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 5 . 3 % of patients treated with PRALUENT and 5 . 1 % of patients treated with placebo .
The most common adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation in patients treated with PRALUENT were allergic reactions ( 0 . 6 % versus 0 . 2 % for PRALUENT and placebo , respectively ) and elevated liver enzymes ( 0 . 3 % versus < 0 . 1 % ) .
In an analysis of ezetimibe - controlled trials in which 864 patients were exposed to PRALUENT for a median of 27 weeks and 618 patients were exposed to ezetimibe for a median of 24 weeks , the types and frequencies of common adverse reactions were similar to those listed above .
In a cardiovascular outcomes trial in which 9451 patients were exposed to PRALUENT for a median of 31 months and 9443 patients were exposed to placebo for a median of 32 months , common adverse reactions ( greater than 5 % of patients treated with PRALUENT and occurring more frequently than placebo ) included non - cardiac chest pain ( 7 . 0 % PRALUENT , 6 . 8 % placebo ) , nasopharyngitis ( 6 . 0 % PRALUENT , 5 . 6 % placebo ) , and myalgia ( 5 . 6 % PRALUENT , 5 . 3 % placebo ) .
In the HoFH placebo - controlled trial in which 45 patients were exposed to PRALUENT for a median of 12 weeks and 24 patients were exposed to placebo for a median of 12 weeks , no additional adverse reactions were identified .
Local Injection Site Reactions In a pool of placebo - controlled trials evaluating PRALUENT 75 mg and / or 150 mg administered every 2 weeks , local injection site reactions including erythema / redness , itching , swelling , and pain / tenderness were reported more frequently in patients treated with PRALUENT ( 7 . 2 % versus 5 . 1 % for PRALUENT and placebo , respectively ) .
Few patients discontinued treatment because of these reactions ( 0 . 2 % versus 0 . 4 % for PRALUENT and placebo , respectively ) , but patients receiving PRALUENT had a greater number of injection site reactions , had more reports of associated symptoms , and had reactions of longer average duration than patients receiving placebo .
In a 48 - week placebo - controlled trial evaluating PRALUENT 300 mg every 4 weeks and 75 mg every 2 weeks , in which all patients received an injection of drug or placebo every 2 weeks , local injection site reactions were reported more frequently in patients treated with PRALUENT 300 mg every 4 weeks as compared to those receiving PRALUENT 75 mg every 2 weeks or placebo ( 16 . 6 % , 9 . 6 % , and 7 . 9 % , respectively ) .
Three patients ( 0 . 7 % ) treated with PRALUENT 300 mg every 4 weeks discontinued treatment due to local injection site reactions versus no patients ( 0 % ) in the other 2 treatment groups .
In a cardiovascular outcomes trial , local injection site reactions were reported in 3 . 8 % of patients treated with PRALUENT versus 2 . 1 % patients treated with placebo , and led to permanent discontinuation in 26 patients ( 0 . 3 % ) versus 3 patients ( < 0 . 1 % ) , respectively .
Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions were reported more frequently in patients treated with PRALUENT than in those treated with placebo ( 8 . 6 % versus 7 . 8 % ) .
The most common hypersensitivity reaction was pruritus ( 1 . 1 % versus 0 . 4 % for PRALUENT and placebo , respectively ) .
The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to allergic reactions was higher among those treated with PRALUENT ( 0 . 6 % versus 0 . 2 % ) .
Serious allergic reactions , such as hypersensitivity , nummular eczema , and hypersensitivity vasculitis were reported in patients using PRALUENT in controlled clinical trials .
Liver Enzyme Abnormalities In the primary hyperlipidemia trials , liver - related disorders ( primarily related to abnormalities in liver enzymes ) were reported in 2 . 5 % of patients treated with PRALUENT and 1 . 8 % of patients treated with placebo , leading to treatment discontinuation in 0 . 4 % and 0 . 2 % of patients , respectively .
Increases in serum transaminases to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 1 . 7 % of patients treated with PRALUENT and 1 . 4 % of patients treated with placebo .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is a potential for immunogenicity with PRALUENT .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies to PRALUENT in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading .
In a cardiovascular outcomes trial , 5 . 5 % ( 504 / 9091 ) of patients treated with PRALUENT 75 mg and / or 150 mg every 2 weeks had anti - drug antibodies ( ADA ) detected after initiating treatment compared with 1 . 6 % ( 149 / 9097 ) of patients treated with placebo .
Persistent ADA responses , defined as at least 2 consecutive post - baseline samples with positive ADA separated by at least a 16 - week period , were observed in 0 . 7 % of patients treated with PRALUENT and 0 . 4 % of patients treated with placebo .
Neutralizing antibody ( NAb ) responses were observed in 0 . 5 % of patients treated with PRALUENT and in < 0 . 1 % of patients treated with placebo .
Efficacy based on reductions in LDL - C was mostly similar in patients with or without ADA .
However , some patients treated with PRALUENT with persistent or neutralizing antibodies experienced attenuation in LDL - C efficacy .
A higher incidence of injection site reactions were observed in patients with treatment - emergent ADA compared to patients who were ADA negative ( 7 . 5 % vs 3 . 6 % ) .
In a pool of ten placebo - controlled and active - controlled trials of patients treated with PRALUENT 75 mg and / or 150 mg every 2 weeks as well as in a separate clinical study of patients treated with PRALUENT 75 mg every 2 weeks or 300 mg every 4 weeks ( including some patients with dose adjustment to 150 mg every 2 weeks ) , the incidence of detecting ADA and NAb was similar to the results from the trial described above .
The long - term consequences of continuing PRALUENT treatment in the presence of ADA are unknown .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported during post - approval use of PRALUENT .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Hypersensitivity reactions : Angioedema • Influenza - like illness 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from clinical trials and postmarketing reports on PRALUENT use in pregnant women are insufficient to evaluate for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , there were no effects on embryo - fetal development when rats were subcutaneously administered alirocumab during organogenesis at dose exposures up to 12 - fold the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 150 mg every two weeks .
In monkeys , suppression of the humoral immune response was observed in infant monkeys when alirocumab was dosed during organogenesis to parturition at dose exposures 13 - fold the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 150 mg every two weeks .
No additional effects on pregnancy or neonatal / infant development were observed at dose exposures up to 81 - fold the maximum recommended human dose of 150 mg every two weeks .
Measurable alirocumab serum concentrations were observed in the infant monkeys at birth at comparable levels to maternal serum , indicating that alirocumab , like other IgG antibodies , crosses the placental barrier .
Monoclonal antibodies are transported across the placenta in increasing amounts especially near term ; therefore , alirocumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population ( s ) is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % - 4 % and 15 % - 20 % , respectively .
There is a pregnancy safety study for PRALUENT .
If PRALUENT is administered during pregnancy , healthcare providers should report PRALUENT exposure by contacting Regeneron at 1 - 844 - 734 - 6643 .
Data Animal data In Sprague Dawley rats , no effects on embryo - fetal development were observed when alirocumab was dosed at up to 75 mg / kg / dose by the subcutaneous route on gestation days 6 and 12 at exposures 12 - fold the maximum recommended human dose of 150 mg every two weeks , based on serum AUC .
In cynomolgus monkeys , suppression of the humoral immune response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) antigen was observed in infant monkeys at 4 to 6 months of age when alirocumab was dosed during organogenesis to parturition at 15 mg / kg / week and 75 mg / kg / week by the subcutaneous route , corresponding to 13 - fold and 81 - fold the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 150 mg every two weeks , based on serum AUC .
The lowest dose tested in the monkey resulted in humoral immune suppression ; therefore , it is unknown if this effect would be observed at clinical exposure .
No study designed to challenge the immune system of infant monkeys was conducted .
No additional embryo - fetal , prenatal or postnatal effects were observed in infant monkeys , and no maternal effects were observed , when alirocumab was dosed at up to 75 mg / kg / week by the subcutaneous route , corresponding to maternal exposure of 81 - fold the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 150 mg every two weeks , based on serum AUC .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of alirocumab in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for PRALUENT and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from PRALUENT or from the underlying maternal condition .
Human IgG is present in human milk , but published data suggest that breastmilk IgG antibodies do not enter the neonatal and infant circulation in substantial amounts .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of PRALUENT have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In controlled trials , 3663 patients treated with PRALUENT were ≥ 65 years of age and 734 patients treated with PRALUENT were ≥ 75 years of age .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderately impaired renal function .
No data are available in patients with severe renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment .
No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION Alirocumab is a human monoclonal antibody ( IgG1 isotype ) that targets proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 ( PCSK9 ) .
Alirocumab is a PCSK9 inhibitor produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese Hamster Ovary cell suspension culture .
Alirocumab consists of two disulfide - linked human heavy chains , each covalently linked through a disulfide bond to a human kappa light chain .
A single N - linked glycosylation site is located in each heavy chain within the CH2 domain of the Fc constant region of the molecule .
The variable domains of the heavy and light chains combine to form the PCSK9 binding site within the antibody .
Alirocumab has an approximate molecular weight of 146 kDa .
PRALUENT is a sterile , preservative - free , clear , colorless to pale yellow solution for subcutaneous use .
PRALUENT 75 mg / mL or 150 mg / mL solution for subcutaneous injection in a single - dose pre - filled pen is supplied in a siliconized 1 mL Type - 1 clear glass syringe .
Each 75 mg / mL pre - filled pen contains 75 mg alirocumab , histidine ( 8 mM ) , polysorbate 20 ( 0 . 1 mg ) , sucrose ( 100 mg ) , and Water for Injection USP , to pH 6 . 0 .
Each 150 mg / mL pre - filled pen contains 150 mg alirocumab , histidine ( 6 mM ) , polysorbate 20 ( 0 . 1 mg ) , sucrose ( 100 mg ) , and Water for Injection USP , to pH 6 . 0 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Alirocumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 ( PCSK9 ) .
PCSK9 binds to the low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptors ( LDLR ) on the surface of hepatocytes to promote LDLR degradation within the liver .
By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR , alirocumab increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL , thereby lowering LDL - C levels .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Alirocumab reduced free PCSK9 in a concentration - dependent manner .
Following a single subcutaneous administration of alirocumab 75 or 150 mg , maximal suppression of free PCSK9 occurred within 4 to 8 hours .
Free PCSK9 concentrations returned to baseline when alirocumab concentrations decreased below the limit of quantitation .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After subcutaneous administration of 75 mg to 300 mg alirocumab , median times to maximum serum concentrations ( tmax ) were 3 - 7 days .
The pharmacokinetics of alirocumab after single subcutaneous administration of 75 mg into the abdomen , upper arm , or thigh were similar .
The absolute bioavailability of alirocumab after subcutaneous administration was about 85 % as determined by population pharmacokinetics analysis .
A slightly greater than dose proportional increase was observed , with a 2 . 1 - fold to 2 . 7 - fold increase in total alirocumab concentrations for a 2 - fold increase in dose from 75 mg every 2 weeks to 150 mg every 2 weeks .
Monthly dose normalized exposure with 300 mg every 4 weeks treatment was similar to that of 150 mg every 2 weeks .
Steady state was reached after 2 to 3 doses with an accumulation ratio up to a maximum of about 2 - fold .
Distribution Following intravenous administration , the volume of distribution was about 0 . 04 to 0 . 05 L / kg indicating that alirocumab is distributed primarily in the circulatory system .
Elimination Specific metabolism studies were not conducted , because alirocumab is a protein .
Alirocumab is expected to degrade to small peptides and individual amino acids .
In clinical studies where alirocumab was administered in combination with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin , no relevant changes in statin concentrations were observed in the presence of repeated administration of alirocumab , indicating that cytochrome P450 enzymes ( mainly CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 ) and transporter proteins such as P - gp and OATP were not affected by alirocumab .
Two elimination phases were observed for alirocumab .
At low concentrations , the elimination is predominately through saturable binding to target ( PCSK9 ) , while at higher concentrations the elimination of alirocumab is largely through a non - saturable proteolytic pathway .
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis , the median apparent half - life of alirocumab at steady state was 17 to 20 days in patients receiving alirocumab at subcutaneous doses of 75 mg every 2 weeks or 150 mg every 2 weeks .
Specific Populations A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted on data from 2799 patients .
Age , body weight , gender , race , and creatinine clearance were found not to significantly influence alirocumab pharmacokinetics .
Renal Impairment Since monoclonal antibodies are not known to be eliminated via renal pathways , renal function is not expected to impact the pharmacokinetics of alirocumab .
No data are available in patients with severe renal impairment .
Hepatic Impairment Following administration of a single 75 mg SC dose , alirocumab pharmacokinetic profiles in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those in patients with normal hepatic function .
No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
Drug - Drug Interactions The median apparent half - life of alirocumab is reduced to 12 days when administered with a statin ; however , this difference is not clinically meaningful .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with alirocumab .
The mutagenic potential of alirocumab has not been evaluated ; however , monoclonal antibodies are not expected to alter DNA or chromosomes .
There were no adverse effects on surrogate markers of fertility ( e . g . , estrous cyclicity , testicular volume , ejaculate volume , sperm motility , or total sperm count per ejaculate ) in a 6 - month chronic toxicology study in sexually - mature monkeys subcutaneously administered at 5 , 15 , and 75 mg / kg / week at systemic exposures up to 103 - fold the 150 mg every two weeks subcutaneous clinical dose based on serum AUC .
In addition , there were no adverse alirocumab - related anatomic pathology or histopathology findings in reproductive tissues in rat or monkey toxicology studies at systemic exposures up to 11 - fold and 103 - fold respectively , in the 6 - month studies , compared to clinical systemic exposure following a 150 mg every two weeks dose , based on serum AUC .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology During a 13 - week toxicology study of 75 mg / kg once weekly alirocumab in combination with 40 mg / kg once daily atorvastatin in adult monkeys , there were no effects of PRALUENT on the humoral immune response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) after one to two months at exposures 100 - fold greater than the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 150 mg every two weeks , based on AUC .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Adult Patients with Established Cardiovascular Disease Study 1 ( ODYSSEY OUTCOMES , NTC01663402 ) was a multicenter , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial in 18 , 924 adult patients ( 9462 PRALUENT ; 9462 placebo ) followed for up to 5 years .
Patients had an acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) event 4 to 52 weeks prior to randomization and were treated with a lipid - modifying therapy ( LMT ) regimen that was statin - intensive ( defined as atorvastatin 40 or 80 mg , or rosuvastatin 20 or 40 mg ) or at maximally tolerated dose of a statin , with or without other LMT .
Patients were randomized to receive either PRALUENT 75 mg or placebo once every two weeks .
At month 2 , if additional LDL - C lowering was required based on pre - specified LDL - C criteria ( LDL - C ≥ 50 mg / dL ) , PRALUENT was adjusted to 150 mg every 2 weeks .
For patients who had their dose adjusted to 150 mg every 2 weeks and who had two consecutive LDL - C values below 25 mg / dL , down - titration from 150 mg every 2 weeks to 75 mg every 2 weeks was performed .
Patients on 75 mg every 2 weeks who had two consecutive LDL - C values below 15 mg / dL were switched to placebo in a blinded fashion .
Approximately 2615 ( 27 . 7 % ) of 9451 patients treated with PRALUENT required dose adjustment to 150 mg every 2 weeks .
Of these 2615 patients , 805 ( 30 . 8 % ) were down - titrated to 75 mg every 2 weeks .
Overall , 730 ( 7 . 7 % ) of 9451 patients switched to placebo .
A total of 99 . 5 % of patients were followed for survival until the end of the trial .
The median follow - up duration was 33 months .
The mean age at baseline was 59 years ( range 39 - 92 ) , with 25 % women , and 27 % at least 65 years old .
The trial population was 79 % White , 3 % Black , and 13 % Asian ; 17 % identified as Hispanic / Latino ethnicity .
The index ACS event was a myocardial infarction in 83 % of patients and unstable angina in 17 % of patients .
Prior to the index ACS event , 19 % had prior myocardial infarction and 23 % had coronary revascularization procedures ( CABG / PCI ) .
Selected additional baseline risk factors included hypertension ( 65 % ) , diabetes mellitus ( 25 % ) , New York Association class I or II congestive heart failure ( 15 % ) , and eGFR < 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ( 13 % ) .
Most patients ( 89 % ) were receiving statin - intensive therapy with or without other LMT at randomization .
The mean LDL - C value at baseline was 92 . 4 mg / dL .
