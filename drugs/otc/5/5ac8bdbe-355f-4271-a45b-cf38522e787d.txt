Boxed Warning 9 / 2016 Indications and Usage ( 1 . 1 , 1 . 2 ) 9 / 2016 Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 ) 9 / 2016 Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 , 5 . 3 ) 9 / 2016 BOXED WARNING WARNING : DIMINISHED ANTIPLATELET EFFECT IN PATIENTS WITH TWO LOSS - OF - FUNCTION ALLELES OF THE CYP2C19 GENE The effectiveness of clopidogrel results from its antiplatelet activity , which is dependent on its conversion to an active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) system , principally CYP2C19 [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Clopdigorel at recommended doses forms less of the active metabolite and so has a reduced effect on platelet activity in patients who are homozygous for nonfunctional alleles of the CYP2C19 gene , ( termed “ CYP2C19 poor metabolizers ” ) .
Tests are available to identify patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 5 ) ] .
Consider use of another platelet P2Y12 inhibitor in patients identified as CYP2C19 poor metabolizers .

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • CYP2C19 inhibitors : Avoid concomitant use of omeprazole or esomeprazole .
( 5 . 1 ) • Bleeding : Clopidogrel increases risk of bleeding .
( 5 . 2 ) • Discontinuation : Premature discontinuation increases risk of cardiovascular events .
Discontinue 5 days prior to elective surgery that has a major risk of bleeding .
( 5 . 3 ) • Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP ) has been reported .
( 5 . 4 ) • Cross - reactivity among thienopyridines has been reported .
( 5 . 5 ) 5 . 1 Diminished Antiplatelet Activity Due to Impaired CYP2C19 Function Clopidogrel is a prodrug .
Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is achieved through an active metabolite .
The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by genetic variations in CYP2C19 [ see Boxed Warning ] .
The metabolism of clopidogrel can also be impaired by drugs that inhibit CYP2C19 , such as omeprazole or esomeprazole .
Avoid concomitant use of clopidogrel with omeprazole or esomeprazole because both significantly reduce the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 2 General Risk of Bleeding Thienopyridines , including clopidogrel , increase the risk of bleeding .
Thienopyridines inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet ( 7 to 10 days ) .
Because the half - life of clopidogrel ' s active metabolite is short , it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets ; however , platelet transfusions within 4 hours of the loading dose or 2 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective .
5 . 3 Discontinuation of clopidogrel tablets Discontinuation of clopidogrel increases the risk of cardiovascular events .
If clopidogrel must be temporarily discontinued ( e . g . , to treat bleeding or for surgery with a major risk of bleeding ) , restart it as soon as possible .
When possible , interrupt therapy with clopidogrel for five days prior to such surgery .
Resume clopidogrel as soon as hemostasis is achieved 5 . 4 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura ( TTP ) TTP , sometimes fatal , has been reported following use of clopidogrel , sometimes after a short exposure ( < 2 weeks ) .
TTP is a serious condition that requires urgent treatment including plasmapheresis ( plasma exchange ) .
It is characterized by thrombocytopenia , microangiopathic hemolytic anemia ( schistocytes [ fragmented RBCs ] seen on peripheral smear ) , neurological findings , renal dysfunction , and fever [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 5 Cross - Reactivity among Thienopyridines Hypersensitivity including rash , angioedema or hematologic reaction have been reported in patients receiving clopidogrel , including patients with a history of hypersensitivity or hematologic reaction to other thienopyridines [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 2 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed below and elsewhere in the labeling : • Bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] Bleeding , including life - threatening and fatal bleeding , is the most commonly reported adverse reaction .

6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions and durations of follow up , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Clopidogrel has been evaluated for safety in more than 54 , 000 patients , including over 21 , 000 patients treated for 1 year or more .
The clinically important adverse reactions observed in trials comparing clopidogrel plus aspirin to placebo plus aspirin and trials comparing clopidogrel alone to aspirin alone are discussed below .
Bleeding CURE In CURE , clopidogrel use with aspirin was associated with an increase in major bleeding ( primarily gastrointestinal and at puncture sites ) compared to placebo with aspirin ( see Table 1 ) .
The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage ( 0 . 1 % ) and fatal bleeding ( 0 . 2 % ) were the same in both groups .
Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the clopidogrel group were epistaxis , hematuria , and bruise .
The overall incidence of bleeding is described in Table 1 .

¶ Led to interruption of study medication COMMIT In COMMIT , similar rates of major bleeding were observed in the clopidogrel and placebo groups , both of which also received aspirin ( see Table 2 ) .
Table 2 : Incidence of Bleeding Events in COMMIT ( % patients ) Type of bleeding Clopidogrel ( + aspirin ) ( n = 22961 ) Placebo ( + aspirin ) ( n = 22891 ) p - value Major * noncerebral or cerebral bleeding ** 0 . 6 0 . 5 0 . 59 Major noncerebral 0 . 4 0 . 3 0 . 48 Fatal 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 90 Hemorrhagic stroke 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 91 Fatal 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 81 Other noncerebral bleeding ( non - major ) 3 . 6 3 . 1 0 . 005 Any noncerebral bleeding 3 . 9 3 . 4 0 . 004 * Major bleeds were cerebral bleeds or non - cerebral bleeds thought to have caused death or that required transfusion .
CAPRIE ( Clopidogrel vs . Aspirin ) In CAPRIE , gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred at a rate of 2 . 0 % in those taking clopidogrel vs . 2 . 7 % in those taking aspirin ; bleeding requiring hospitalization occurred in 0 . 7 % and 1 . 1 % , respectively .
The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0 . 4 % for clopidogrel compared to 0 . 5 % for aspirin .
Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the clopidogrel group were epistaxis and hematoma .
Other Adverse Events In CURE and CHARISMA , which compared clopidogrel plus aspirin to aspirin alone , there was no difference in the rate of adverse events ( other than bleeding ) between clopidogrel and placebo .
In CAPRIE , which compared clopidogrel to aspirin , pruritus was more frequently reported in those taking clopidogrel .
No other difference in the rate of adverse events ( other than bleeding ) was reported .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of clopidogrel .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Hemorrhages , including those with fatal outcome , have been reported in patients treated with clopidogrel .
• Blood and lymphatic system disorders : Agranulocytosis , aplastic anemia / pancytopenia , thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP ) , acquired hemophilia A • Gastrointestinal disorders : Colitis ( including ulcerative or lymphocytic colitis ) , pancreatitis , stomatitis , gastric / duodenal ulcer , diarrhea • General disorders and administration site condition : Fever • Hepato - biliary disorders : Acute liver failure , hepatitis ( non - infectious ) , abnormal liver function test • Immune system disorders : Hypersensitivity reactions , anaphylactoid reactions , serum sickness • Musculoskeletal , connective tissue and bone disorders : Myalgia , arthralgia , arthritis • Nervous system disorders : Taste disorders , headache • Psychiatric disorders : Confusion , hallucinations • Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders : Bronchospasm , interstitial pneumonitis , respiratory tract bleeding , eosinophilic pneumonia • Renal and urinary disorders : Increased creatinine levels • Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Maculopapular , erythematous or exfoliative rash , urticaria , bullous dermatitis , eczema , toxic epidermal necrolysis , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis ( AGEP ) , angioedema , drug - induced hypersensitivity syndrome , drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms ( DRESS ) , erythema multiforme , skin bleeding , lichen planus , generalized pruritus • Vascular disorders : Vasculitis , hypotension 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , warfarin , selective serotonin and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs , SNRIs ) : Increases risk of bleeding .
( 7 . 2 , 7 . 3 , 7 . 4 ) • Repaglinide ( CYP2C8 substrates ) : Increases substrate plasma concentrations .
( 7 . 5 ) 7 . 1 CYP2C19 Inhibitors Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19 .
Concomitant use of certain drugs that inhibit the activity of this enzyme results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] Omeprazole or esomeprazole Avoid concomitant use of clopidogrel with omeprazole or esomeprazole .
In clinical studies , omeprazole was shown to reduce significantly the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel when given concomitantly or 12 hours apart .
A similar reduction in antiplatelet activity was observed with esomeprazole when given concomitantly with clopidogrel .
Dexlansoprazole , lansoprazole and pantoprazole had less effect on the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel than did omeprazole or esomeprazole [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Nonsteroidal Anti - Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) Coadministration of clopidogrel and NSAIDs increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding .
7 . 3 Warfarin ( CYP2C9 Substrates ) Although the administration of clopidogrel 75 mg per day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S - warfarin ( a CYP2C9 substrate ) or INR in patients receiving long - term warfarin therapy , coadministration of clopidogrel with warfarin increases the risk of bleeding because of independent effects on hemostasis .
However , at high concentrations in vitro , clopidogrel inhibits CYP2C9 .
7 . 4 SSRIs and SNRIs Since selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ) affect platelet activation , the concomitant administration of SSRIs and SNRIs with clopidogrel may increase the risk of bleeding .
7 . 5 Repaglinide ( CYP2C8 Substrates ) The acyl - β - glucuronide metabolite of clopidogrel is a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8 .
Clopidogrel can increase the systemic exposure to drugs that are primarily cleared by CYP2C8 , thereby needing dose - adjustment and appropriate monitoring .
Clopidogrel increased repaglinide exposures by 3 . 9 - to 5 . 1 - fold [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Avoid concomitant use of repaglinide with clopidogrel .
If concomitant use cannot be avoided , initiate repaglinide at 0 . 5 mg before each meal and do not exceed a total daily dose of 4 mg .
Increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required during concomitant use .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers : Discontinue drug or nursing .
( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 500 and 300 mg / kg / day , respectively ( 65 and 78 times the recommended daily human dose , respectively , on a mg / m2 basis ) , revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or fetotoxicity due to clopidogrel .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of a human response , clopidogrel should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Studies in rats have shown that clopidogrel and / or its metabolites are excreted in the milk .
It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from clopidogrel , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric populations have not been established .
A randomized , placebo - controlled trial ( CLARINET ) did not demonstrate a clinical benefit of clopidogrel in neonates and infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease palliated with a systemic - to - pulmonary arterial shunt .
Possible factors contributing to this outcome were the dose of clopidogrel , the concomitant administration of aspirin and the late initiation of therapy following shunt palliation .
It cannot be ruled out that a trial with a different design would demonstrate a clinical benefit in this patient population .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in the CAPRIE and CURE controlled clinical studies , approximately 50 % of patients treated with clopidogrel were 65 years of age and older , and 15 % were 75 years and older .
In COMMIT , approximately 58 % of the patients treated with clopidogrel were 60 years and older , 26 % of whom were 70 years and older .
The observed risk of bleeding events with clopidogrel plus aspirin versus placebo plus aspirin by age category is provided in Table 1 and Table 2 for the CURE and COMMIT trials , respectively [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Experience is limited in patients with severe and moderate renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Platelet inhibition by clopidogrel is irreversible and will last for the life of the platelet .
Overdose following clopidogrel administration may result in bleeding complications .
A single oral dose of clopidogrel at 1500 or 2000 mg / kg was lethal to mice and to rats and at 3000 mg / kg to baboons .
Symptoms of acute toxicity were vomiting , prostration , difficult breathing , and gastrointestinal hemorrhage in animals .
Based on biological plausibility , platelet transfusion may restore clotting ability .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Clopidogrel is an inhibitor of platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Clopidogrel must be metabolized by CYP450 enzymes to produce the active metabolite that inhibits platelet aggregation .
The active metabolite of clopidogrel selectively inhibits the binding of adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) to its platelet P2Y12 receptor and the subsequent ADP - mediated activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb / IIIa complex , thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation .
This action is irreversible .
Consequently , platelets exposed to clopidogrel ' s active metabolite are affected for the remainder of their lifespan ( about 7 to 10 days ) .
Platelet aggregation induced by agonists other than ADP is also inhibited by blocking the amplification of platelet activation by released ADP .
Dose - dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen 2 hours after single oral doses of clopidogrel .
Repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day inhibit ADP - induced platelet aggregation on the first day , and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7 .
At steady state , the average inhibition level observed with a dose of 75 mg clopidogrel per day was between 40 % and 60 % .
Platelet aggregation and bleeding time gradually return to baseline values after treatment is discontinued , generally in about 5 days .
Geriatric Patients Elderly ( ≥ 75 years ) and young healthy subjects had similar effects on platelet aggregation .
Renally - Impaired Patients After repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day , patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance from 5 to 15 mL / min ) and moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance from 30 to 60 mL / min ) showed low ( 25 % ) inhibition of ADP - induced platelet aggregation .
Hepatically - Impaired Patients After repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel per day for 10 days in patients with severe hepatic impairment , inhibition of ADP - induced platelet aggregation was similar to that observed in healthy subjects .
Gender In a small study comparing men and women , less inhibition of ADP - induced platelet aggregation was observed in women .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is metabolized to a pharmacologically active metabolite and inactive metabolites .
Absorption After single and repeated oral doses of 75 mg per day , clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed .
Absorption is at least 50 % , based on urinary excretion of clopidogrel metabolites .
Effect of Food Clopidogrel can be administered with or without food .
In a study in healthy male subjects when clopidogrel 75 mg per day was given with a standard breakfast , mean inhibition of ADP - induced platelet aggregation was reduced by less than 9 % .
The active metabolite AUC0 - 24 was unchanged in the presence of food , while there was a 57 % decrease in active metabolite Cmax .
Similar results were observed when a clopidogrel 300 mg loading dose was administered with a high - fat breakfast .
Metabolism Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by two main metabolic pathways : one mediated by esterases and leading to hydrolysis into an inactive carboxylic acid derivative ( 85 % of circulating metabolites ) and one mediated by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes .
Cytochromes first oxidize clopidogrel to a 2 - oxo - clopidogrel intermediate metabolite .
Subsequent metabolism of the 2 - oxo - clopidogrel intermediate metabolite results in formation of the active metabolite , a thiol derivative of clopidogrel .
This metabolic pathway is mediated by CYP2C19 , CYP3A , CYP2B6 and CYP1A2 .
The active thiol metabolite binds rapidly and irreversibly to platelet receptors , thus inhibiting platelet aggregation for the lifespan of the platelet .
The Cmax of the active metabolite is twice as high following a single 300 mg clopidogrel loading dose as it is after four days of 75 mg maintenance dose .
Cmax occurs approximately 30 to 60 minutes after dosing .
In the 75 to 300 mg dose range , the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite deviates from dose proportionality : increasing the dose by a factor of four results in 2 . 0 - and 2 . 7 - fold increases in Cmax and AUC , respectively .
Elimination Following an oral dose of 14 C - labeled clopidogrel in humans , approximately 50 % of total radioactivity was excreted in urine and approximately 46 % in feces over the 5 days post - dosing .
After a single , oral dose of 75 mg , clopidogrel has a half - life of approximately 6 hours .
The half - life of the active metabolite is about 30 minutes .
Drug Interactions Effect of other drugs on clopidogrel Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19 .
Concomitant use of certain inhibitors of this enzyme results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition .
Proton Pump Inhibitors ( PPI ) The effect of proton pump inhibitors ( PPI ) on the systemic exposure to the clopidogrel active metabolite following multiple doses of clopidogrel 75 mg evaluated in dedicated drug interaction studies is presented in Figure 1 .
Figure 1 : Exposure to Clopidogrel Active Metabolite Following Multiple Doses of clopidogrel 75 mg Alone or with Proton Pump Inhibitors ( PPIs ) Co - administered PPI Effect on active metabolite AUC Mean and 90 % confidence interval [ MULTIMEDIA ] Change relative to clopidogrel administered alone Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters measured in these studies showed that the interaction was highest with omeprazole and least with dexlansoprazole .
Effect of clopidogrel on other drugs In vitro studies have shown that the glucuronide metabolite of clopidogrel is a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8 .
Concomitant administration of repaglinide with clopidogrel increased the systemic exposure to repaglinide ( AUC0 - ∞ ) by 5 . 1 - fold following the loading dose ( 300 mg ) and by 3 . 9 - fold on day 3 of the maintenance dose ( 75 mg ) of clopidogrel [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 5 ) ] .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 . 5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C19 is involved in the formation of both the active metabolite and the 2 - oxo - clopidogrel intermediate metabolite .
Clopidogrel active metabolite pharmacokinetics and antiplatelet effects , as measured by ex vivo platelet aggregation assays , differ according to CYP2C19 genotype .
Patients who are homozygous for nonfunctional alleles of the CYP2C19 gene are termed “ CYP2C19 poor metabolizers ” .
Approximately 2 % of White and 4 % of Black patients are poor metabolizers ; the prevalence of poor metabolism is higher in Asian patients ( e . g . , 14 % of Chinese ) .
Tests are available to identify patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers .
A crossover study in 40 healthy subjects , 10 each in the four CYP2C19 metabolizer groups , evaluated pharmacokinetic and antiplatelet responses using 300 mg followed by 75 mg per day and 600 mg followed by 150 mg per day , each for a total of 5 days .
Decreased active metabolite exposure and diminished inhibition of platelet aggregation were observed in the poor metabolizers as compared to the other groups .

Clopidogrel was not genotoxic in four in vitro tests ( Ames test , DNA - repair test in rat hepatocytes , gene mutation assay in Chinese hamster fibroblasts , and metaphase chromosome analysis of human lymphocytes ) and in one in vivo test ( micronucleus test by oral route in mice ) .
Clopidogrel was found to have no effect on fertility of male and female rats at oral doses up to 400 mg / kg per day ( 52 times the recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Acute Coronary Syndrome CURE The CURE study included 12 , 562 patients with ACS without ST - elevation ( UA or NSTEMI ) and presenting within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms consistent with ischemia .
Patients were required to have either ECG changes compatible with new ischemia ( without ST - elevation ) or elevated cardiac enzymes or troponin I or T to at least twice the upper limit of normal .
Patients were randomized to receive clopidogrel ( 300 - mg loading dose followed by 75 mg once daily ) or placebo , and were treated for up to one year .
Patients also received aspirin ( 75 to 325 mg once daily ) and other standard therapies such as heparin .
The use of GPIIb / IIIa inhibitors was not permitted for three days prior to randomization .
The patient population was largely White ( 82 % ) and included 38 % women , and 52 % age ≥ 65 years of age .
Only about 20 % of patients underwent revascularization during the initial hospitalization and few underwent emergent or urgent revascularization .
The number of patients experiencing the primary outcome ( CV death , MI , or stroke ) was 582 ( 9 . 3 % ) in the clopidogrel - treated group and 719 ( 11 . 4 % ) in the placebo - treated group , a 20 % relative risk reduction ( 95 % CI of 10 % to 28 % ; p < 0 . 001 ) for the clopidogrel - treated group ( see Table 4 ) .

† The individual components do not represent a breakdown of the primary and co - primary outcomes , but rather the total number of subjects experiencing an event during the course of the study .
Most of the benefit of clopidogrel occurred in the first two months , but the difference from placebo was maintained throughout the course of the trial ( up to 12 months ) ( see Figure 2 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] The effect of clopidogrel did not differ significantly in various subgroups , as shown in Figure 3 .
The benefits associated with clopidogrel were independent of the use of other acute and long - term cardiovascular therapies , including heparin / LMWH , intravenous glycoprotein IIb / IIIa ( GPIIb / IIIa ) inhibitors , lipid - lowering drugs , beta - blockers , and ACE - inhibitors .
The efficacy of clopidogrel was observed independently of the dose of aspirin ( 75 to 325 mg once daily ) .
The use of oral anticoagulants , non - study antiplatelet drugs , and chronic NSAIDs was not allowed in CURE .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] The use of clopidogrel in CURE was associated with a decrease in the use of thrombolytic therapy ( 71 patients [ 1 . 1 % ] in the clopidogrel group , 126 patients [ 2 . 0 % ] in the placebo group ; relative risk reduction of 43 % ) , and GPIIb / IIIa inhibitors ( 369 patients [ 5 . 9 % ] in the clopidogrel group , 454 patients [ 7 . 2 % ] in the placebo group , relative risk reduction of 18 % ) .
The use of clopidogrel in CURE did not affect the number of patients treated with CABG or PCI ( with or without stenting ) , ( 2253 patients [ 36 . 0 % ] in the clopidogrel group , 2324 patients [ 36 . 9 % ] in the placebo group ; relative risk reduction of 4 . 0 % ) .
COMMIT In patients with STEMI , the safety and efficacy of clopidogrel were evaluated in the randomized , placebo - controlled , double - blind study , COMMIT .
COMMIT included 45 , 852 patients presenting within 24 hours of the onset of the symptoms of myocardial infarction with supporting ECG abnormalities ( i . e . , ST - elevation , ST - depression or left bundle - branch block ) .
Patients were randomized to receive clopidogrel ( 75 mg once daily ) or placebo , in combination with aspirin ( 162 mg per day ) , for 28 days or until hospital discharge , whichever came first .
The primary endpoints were death from any cause and the first occurrence of re - infarction , stroke or death .
The patient population included 28 % women , 58 % age ≥ 60 years ( 26 % age ≥ 70 years ) , 55 % patients who received thrombolytics , 68 % who received ACE - inhibitors , and only 3 % who underwent PCI .
As shown in Table 5 and Figure 4 and Figure 5 below , clopidogrel significantly reduced the relative risk of death from any cause by 7 % ( p = 0 . 029 ) , and the relative risk of the combination of re - infarction , stroke or death by 9 % ( p = 0 . 002 ) .
Table 5 : Outcome Events in the COMMIT Event Clopidogrel ( + aspirin ) ( N = 22961 ) Placebo ( + aspirin ) ( N = 22891 ) Odds ratio ( 95 % CI ) p - value Composite endpoint : Death , MI , or Stroke * 2121 ( 9 . 2 % ) 2310 ( 10 . 1 % ) 0 . 91 ( 0 . 86 , 0 . 97 ) 0 . 002 Death Non - fatal MI ** Non - fatal Stroke ** 1726 ( 7 . 5 % ) 1845 ( 8 . 1 % ) 0 . 93 ( 0 . 87 , 0 . 99 ) 0 . 029 270 ( 1 . 2 % ) 330 ( 1 . 4 % ) 0 . 81 ( 0 . 69 , 0 . 95 ) 0 . 011 127 ( 0 . 6 % ) 142 ( 0 . 6 % ) 0 . 89 ( 0 . 70 , 1 . 13 ) 0 . 33 * 9 patients ( 2 clopidogrel and 7 placebo ) suffered both a non - fatal stroke and a non - fatal MI .
** Non - fatal MI and non - fatal stroke exclude patients who died ( of any cause ) .

Figure 5 : Cumulative Event Rates for the Combined Endpoint Re - Infarction , Stroke or Death in the COMMIT Study * [ MULTIMEDIA ] * All treated patients received aspirin .
The effect of clopidogrel did not differ significantly in various pre - specified subgroups as shown in Figure 6 .
The effect was also similar in non - prespecified subgroups including those based on infarct location , Killip class or prior MI history ( see Figure 7 ) .
Such subgroup analyses should be interpreted cautiously .
Figure 6 : Effects of Adding clopidogrel to Aspirin on the Combined Primary Endpoint across Baseline and Concomitant Medication Subgroups for the COMMIT Study [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Recent Myocardial Infarction , Recent Stroke , or Established Peripheral Arterial Disease CAPRIE The CAPRIE trial was a 19 , 185 - patient , 304 - center , international , randomized , double - blind , parallel - group study comparing clopidogrel ( 75 mg daily ) to aspirin ( 325 mg daily ) .
The patients randomized had : 1 ) recent histories of myocardial infarction ( within 35 days ) ; 2 ) recent histories of ischemic stroke ( within 6 months ) with at least a week of residual neurological signs ; or 3 ) established peripheral arterial disease .
Patients received randomized treatment for an average of 1 . 6 years ( maximum of 3 years ) .
The trial ' s primary outcome was the time to first occurrence of new ischemic stroke ( fatal or not ) , new myocardial infarction ( fatal or not ) , or other vascular death .
Deaths not easily attributable to nonvascular causes were all classified as vascular .
Table 6 : Outcome Events in the CAPRIE Primary Analysis Patients clopidogrel n = 9599 aspirin n = 9586 Ischemic stroke ( fatal or not ) 438 ( 4 . 6 % ) 461 ( 4 . 8 % ) MI ( fatal or not ) 275 ( 2 . 9 % ) 333 ( 3 . 5 % ) Other vascular death 226 ( 2 . 4 % ) 226 ( 2 . 4 % ) Total 939 ( 9 . 8 % ) 1020 ( 10 . 6 % ) As shown in Table 6 , clopidogrel was associated with a lower incidence of outcome events , primarily MI .
The overall relative risk reduction ( 9 . 8 % vs . 10 . 6 % ) was 8 . 7 % , p = 0 . 045 .
Similar results were obtained when all - cause mortality and all - cause strokes were counted instead of vascular mortality and ischemic strokes ( risk reduction 6 . 9 % ) .
In patients who survived an on - study stroke or myocardial infarction , the incidence of subsequent events was lower in the clopidogrel group .
The curves showing the overall event rate are shown in Figure 7 .
The event curves separated early and continued to diverge over the 3 - year follow - up period .
Figure 7 : Fatal or Non - Fatal Vascular Events in the CAPRIE Study [ MULTIMEDIA ] The statistical significance favoring clopidogrel over aspirin was marginal ( p = 0 . 045 ) .
However , because aspirin is itself effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with recent myocardial infarction or stroke , the effect of clopidogrel is substantial .
The CAPRIE trial included a population that was randomized on the basis of 3 entry criteria .
The efficacy of clopidogrel relative to aspirin was heterogeneous across these randomized subgroups ( p = 0 . 043 ) .
It is not clear whether this difference is real or a chance occurrence .
Although the CAPRIE trial was not designed to evaluate the relative benefit of clopidogrel over aspirin in the individual patient subgroups , the benefit appeared to be strongest in patients who were enrolled because of peripheral vascular disease ( especially those who also had a history of myocardial infarction ) and weaker in stroke patients .
In patients who were enrolled in the trial on the sole basis of a recent myocardial infarction , clopidogrel was not numerically superior to aspirin .
Figure 8 : Hazard Ratio and 95 % CI by Baseline Subgroups in the CAPRIE Study [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 3 No Demonstrated Benefit of Clopidogrel Plus Aspirin in Patients with Multiple Risk Factors or Established Vascular Disease CHARISMA The CHARISMA trial was a 15 , 603 subject , randomized , double - blind , parallel group study comparing clopidogrel ( 75 mg daily ) to placebo for prevention of ischemic events in patients with vascular disease or multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis .
All subjects were treated with aspirin 75 to 162 mg daily .
The mean duration of treatment was 23 months .
The study failed to demonstrate a reduction in the occurrence of the primary endpoint , a composite of CV death , MI , or stroke .
A total of 534 ( 6 . 9 % ) patients in the clopidogrel group versus 573 ( 7 . 4 % ) patients in the placebo group experienced a primary outcome event ( p = 0 . 22 ) .
Bleeding of all severities was more common in the subjects randomized to clopidogrel .
