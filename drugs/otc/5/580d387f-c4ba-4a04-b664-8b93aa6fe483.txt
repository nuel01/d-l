Rx only FOR INTRAVAGINAL USE ONLY NOT FOR OPHTHALMIC , DERMAL , OR ORAL USE DESCRIPTION Clindamycin phosphate is a water soluble ester of the semi - synthetic antibiotic produced by a 7 ( S ) - chloro - substitution of the 7 ( R ) - hydroxyl group of the parent antibiotic lincomycin .
The chemical name for clindamycin phosphate is methyl 7 - chloro - 6 , 7 , 8 - trideoxy - 6 - ( 1 - methyl - trans - 4 - propyl - L - 2 - pyrrolidinecarboxamido ) - 1 - thio - L - threo - α - D - galacto - octopyranoside 2 - ( dihydrogen phosphate ) .
It has a molecular weight of 504 . 96 , and the molecular formula is C18H34ClN2O8 PS .
The structural formula is represented below : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2 % , is a semi - solid , white cream , which contains 2 % clindamycin phosphate , USP , at a concentration equivalent to 20 mg clindamycin per gram .
The pH of the cream is between 3 . 0 and 6 . 0 .
The cream also contains benzyl alcohol , cetostearyl alcohol , cetyl palmitate , mineral oil , polysorbate 60 , propylene glycol , sorbitan monostearate , and stearic acid .
Each applicatorful of 5 grams of vaginal cream contains approximately 100 mg of clindamycin phosphate .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following a once a day intravaginal dose of 100 mg of clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2 % , administered to 6 healthy female volunteers for 7 days , approximately 5 % ( range 0 . 6 % to 11 % ) of the administered dose was absorbed systemically .
The peak serum clindamycin concentration observed on the first day averaged 18 ng / mL ( range 4 to 47 ng / mL ) and on day 7 it averaged 25 ng / mL ( range 6 to 61 ng / mL ) .
These peak concentrations were attained approximately 10 hours post - dosing ( range 4 - 24 hours ) .
Following a once a day intravaginal dose of 100 mg of clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2 % , administered for 7 consecutive days to 5 women with bacterial vaginosis , absorption was slower and less variable than that observed in healthy females .
Approximately 5 % ( range 2 % to 8 % ) of the dose was absorbed systemically .
The peak serum clindamycin concentration observed on the first day averaged 13 ng / mL ( range 6 to 34 ng / mL ) and on day 7 it averaged 16 ng / mL ( range 7 to 26 ng / mL ) .
These peak concentrations were attained approximately 14 hours post - dosing ( range 4 - 24 hours ) .
There was little or no systemic accumulation of clindamycin after repeated vaginal dosing of clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2 % .
The systemic half - life was 1 . 5 to 2 . 6 hours .
MICROBIOLOGY Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis at the level of the bacterial ribosome .
The antibiotic binds preferentially to the 50 S ribosomal subunit and affects the process of peptide chain initiation .
Although clindamycin phosphate is inactive in vitro , rapid in vivo hydrolysis converts this compound to the antibacterially active clindamycin .
Culture and sensitivity testing of bacteria are not routinely performed to establish the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis .
( See INDICATIONS AND USAGE . )
Standard methodology for the susceptibility testing of the potential bacterial vaginosis pathogens , Gardnerella vaginalis , Mobiluncus spp . , or Mycoplasma hominis , has not been defined .
Nonetheless , clindamycin is an antimicrobial agent active in vitro against most strains of the following organisms that have been reported to be associated with bacterial vaginosis : Bacteroides spp .
Mycoplasma hominis Peptostreptococcus spp .
Gardnerella vaginalis Mobiluncus spp .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2 % , is indicated in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis ( formerly referred to as Haemophilus vaginitis , Gardnerella vaginitis , nonspecific vaginitis , Corynebacterium vaginitis , or anaerobic vaginosis ) .
Clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2 % , can be used to treat non - pregnant women and pregnant women during the second and third trimester .
( See CLINICAL STUDIES . )
NOTE : For purposes of this indication , a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually defined by the presence of a homogeneous vaginal discharge that ( a ) has a pH of greater than 4 . 5 , ( b ) emits a " fishy " amine odor when mixed with a 10 % KOH solution , and ( c ) contains clue cells on microscopic examination .
Gram ' s stain results consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis include ( a ) markedly reduced or absent Lactobacillus morphology , ( b ) predominance of Gardnerella morphotype , and ( c ) absent or few white blood cells .
Other pathogens commonly associated with vulvovaginitis , e . g . , Trichomonas vaginalis , Chlamydia trachomatis , N . gonorrhoeae , Candida albicans , and Herpes simplex virus should be ruled out .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2 % , is contraindicated in individuals with a history of hypersensitivity to clindamycin , lincomycin , or any of the components of this vaginal cream .
Clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2 % , is also contraindicated in individuals with a history of regional enteritis , ulcerative colitis , or a history of " antibiotic - associated " colitis .
WARNINGS Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents , including clindamycin , and may range in severity from mild to life - threatening .
Orally and parenterally administered clindamycin has been associated with severe colitis which may end fatally .
Diarrhea , bloody diarrhea , and colitis ( including pseudomembranous colitis ) have been reported with the use of orally and parenterally administered clindamycin , as well as with topical ( dermal ) formulations of clindamycin .
Therefore , it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of clindamycin , even when administered by the vaginal route , because approximately 5 % of the clindamycin dose is systemically absorbed from the vagina .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia .
Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of " antibiotic - associated ′′ colitis .
After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established , therapeutic measures should be initiated .
Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to discontinuation of the drug alone .
In moderate to severe cases , consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes , protein supplementation , and treatment with an antibacterial drug clinically effective against Clostridium difficile colitis .
Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antimicrobial treatment .
PRECAUTIONS General Clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2 % , contains ingredients that will cause burning and irritation of the eye .
In the event of accidental contact with the eye , rinse the eye with copious amounts of cool tap water .
The use of clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2 % may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms in the vagina .
In clinical studies involving 600 non - pregnant women who received treatment for 3 days , Candida albicans was detected , either symptomatically or by culture , in 8 . 8 % of patients .
In 9 % of the patients , vaginitis was recorded .
In clinical studies involving 1325 non - pregnant women who received treatment for 7 days , Candida albicans was detected , either symptomatically or by culture , in 10 . 5 % of patients .
Vaginitis was recorded in 10 . 7 % of the patients .
In 180 pregnant women who received treatment for 7 days , Candida albicans was detected , either symptomatically or by culture , in 13 . 3 % of patients .
In 7 . 2 % of the patients , vaginitis was recorded .
Candida albicans , as reported here , includes the terms : vaginal moniliasis and moniliasis ( body as a whole ) .
Vaginitis includes the terms : vulvo - vaginal disorder , vulvovaginitis , vaginal discharge , trichomonal vaginitis , and vaginitis .
Information for the Patient : The patient should be instructed not to engage in vaginal intercourse , or use other vaginal products ( such as tampons or douches ) during treatment with this product .
The patient should also be advised that this cream contains mineral oil that may weaken latex or rubber products such as condoms or vaginal contraceptive diaphragms .
Therefore , use of such products within 72 hours following treatment with clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2 % , is not recommended .
Drug Interactions Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents .
Therefore , it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long term studies in animals have not been performed with clindamycin to evaluate carcinogenic potential .
Genotoxicity tests performed included a rat micronucleus test and an Ames test .
Both tests were negative .
Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg / kg / day ( 31 times the human exposure based on mg / m2 ) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category B There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy .
This drug should be used during the first trimester of pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Clindamycin phosphate vaginal cream 2 % has been studied in pregnant women during the second trimester .
In women treated for seven days , abnormal labor was reported in 1 . 1 % of patients who received clindamycin vaginal cream 2 % compared with 0 . 5 % of patients who received placebo .
Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and mice using oral and parenteral doses of clindamycin up to 600 mg / kg / day ( 62 and 25 times , respectively , the maximum human exposure based on mg / m2 ) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to clindamycin .
In one mouse strain , cleft palates were observed in treated fetuses ; this outcome was not produced in other mouse strains or in other species and is , therefore , considered to be a strain specific effect .
See INDICATIONS AND USAGE ; PRECAUTIONS , General ; and ADVERSE REACTIONS .
Nursing Mothers Clindamycin has been detected in human milk after oral or parenteral administration .
It is not known if clindamycin is excreted in human milk following the use of vaginally administered clindamycin phosphate .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from clindamycin phosphate , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] Other clindamycin formulations : Clindamycin vaginal cream affords minimal peak serum levels and systemic exposure ( AUCs ) of clindamycin compared to 100 mg oral clindamycin dosing .
Although these lower levels of exposure are less likely to produce the common reactions seen with oral clindamycin , the possibility of these and other reactions cannot be excluded presently .
Data from well - controlled trials directly comparing clindamycin administered orally to clindamycin administered vaginally are not available .
The following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported with the oral or parenteral use of clindamycin : Gastrointestinal : Abdominal pain , esophagitis , nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea .
