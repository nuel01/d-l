DESCRIPTION The Ultra - Technekow ™ V4 Generator is prepared with fission - produced molybdenum Mo - 99 adsorbed onto alumina in a column shielded by lead , tungsten , or depleted uranium .
The column assembly and shielding are encased in a plastic container that is covered with a plastic elution hood .
The elution hood has an opening for the column assembly double inlet needles and an opening for the single outlet needle .
The needles accommodate the sterile eluant vials that contain 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection and sterile evacuated collection vials .
A sterile vial containing a bacteriostat is supplied with the generator for the customer to aseptically seal the outlet needle after each elution .
This terminally sterilized generator provides a closed system for the production of sterile metastable technetium Tc - 99 m , which is produced by the decay of molybdenum Mo - 99 .
Incorporated between the column outlet and the collection vial is a sterile 0 . 22 micrometer filter .
Sterile , non - pyrogenic isotonic solutions of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m Injection in 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection can be obtained conveniently by periodic aseptic elution of the generator .
These solutions should be clear , colorless , and free from any particulate matter .
The Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m Injection is suitable for intravenous injection and direct instillation .
The carrier - free solution may be used as is , or diluted to the proper concentration .
Over the life of the generator , an elution will contain an amount of technetium Tc - 99 m in direct proportion to the quantity of Mo - 99 decay since the previous elution of the generator .
The quantity of Tc - 99 m in the eluate is determined by quantity of Mo - 99 on the column , and the elapsed time between elutions .
Each eluate of the generator should not contain more than the USP limit of 0 . 15 kilobecquerel molybdenum Mo - 99 per megabecquerel technetium Tc - 99 m ( 0 . 15 microcurie Mo - 99 per millicurie Tc - 99 m ) per administered dose at the time of administration and an aluminum ion concentration of not more than 10 micrograms per milliliter of the generator eluate , both of which must be determined by the user before administration .
Since the eluate does not contain an antimicrobial agent , it should not be used after 12 hours from the time of generator elution .
Physical Characteristics Technetium Tc - 99 m decays by isomeric transition with a physical half - life of 6 hours .
The principal photon that is useful for detection and imaging studies is listed in Table 1 .
Table 1 .
Principal Radiation Emission Data Radiation Mean Percent Per Disintegration Energy ( keV ) Gamma - 2 89 . 07 140 . 5 External Radiation The specific gamma ray constant for technetium Tc - 99 m is 0 . 795 R / hr - mCi at 1 cm .
The first half - value layer is 0 . 023 cm of lead ( Pb ) .
A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 2 .
For example , the use of 0 . 27 cm thickness of Pb will attenuate the radiation emitted by a factor of about 1000 .
Table 2 .

The physical decay characteristics of molybdenum Mo - 99 are such that only 88 . 6 % of the decaying molybdenum Mo - 99 atoms form technetium Tc - 99 m .
Generator elutions may be made at any time , but the amount of technetium Tc - 99 m available will depend on the interval measured from the last elution .
Approximately 47 % of the maximum available technetium Tc - 99 m is reached after 6 hours and 95 % after 23 hours .
To correct for physical decay of molybdenum Mo - 99 and technetium Tc - 99 m , the fractions that remain at selected intervals of time are shown in Tables 3 and 4 .

Pertechnetate concentrates in the thyroid gland , salivary glands , stomach and choroid plexus .
After intravenous administration it gradually equilibrates with the extracellular space .
A fraction is promptly excreted via the kidneys .
Following the administration of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m as an eye drop , the drug mixes with tears within the conjunctival space .
Within seconds to minutes it leaves the conjunctival space and escapes into the inferior meatus of the nose through the nasolacrimal drainage system .
During this process the pertechnetate ion passes through the canaliculi , the lacrimal sac and the nasolacrimal duct .
In the event of any anatomical or functional blockage of the drainage system there will be a backflow resulting in tearing ( epiphora ) .
Thus the pertechnetate escapes the conjunctival space in the tears .
While the major part of the pertechnetate escapes within a few minutes of normal drainage and tearing , it has been documented that there is some degree of transconjunctival absorption with turnover of 1 . 5 % per minute in normal individuals , 2 . 1 % per minute in patients without any sac and 2 . 7 % per minute in patients with inflamed conjunctiva due to chronic dacryocystitis .
Individual values may vary but these rates are probably representative and indicate that the maximum possible pertechnetate absorbed will remain below one thousandth of that used in other routine diagnostic procedures .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE The Ultra - Technekow ™ V4 generator is a source of sodium pertechnetate Tc 99 m for use in the preparation of FDA - approved diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals , as described in the labeling of these diagnostic radiopharmaceutical kits .
Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m is used IN ADULTS as an agent for : Thyroid Imaging Salivary Gland Imaging Urinary Bladder Imaging ( direct isotopic cystography ) for detection of vesico - ureteral reflux Nasolacrimal Drainage System Imaging ( dacryoscintigraphy ) Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m is used IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS as an agent for : Thyroid Imaging Urinary Bladder Imaging ( direct isotopic cystography ) for the detection of vesico - ureteral reflux CONTRAINDICATIONS None .
WARNINGS Radiation risks associated with the use of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m are greater in pediatric patients than in adults and , in general , the younger the patient the greater the risk owing to greater absorbed radiation doses and longer life expectancy .
These greater risks should be taken firmly into account in all benefit risk assessments involving pediatric patients .
Long - term cumulative radiation exposure may be associated with an increased risk of cancer .
Only use generator eluant specified for use with the Ultra - Technekow ™ V4 Generator .
Do not use any other generator eluant or saline from any other source .
PRECAUTIONS Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by physicians who are qualified by training and experience in the safe use and handling of radionuclides and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate government agency authorized to license the use of radionuclides .
As in the use of any radioactive material , care should be taken to minimize radiation exposure to the patient consistent with proper patient management and to ensure minimum radiation exposure to occupational workers .
After the termination of the nasolacrimal imaging procedure , blowing the nose and washing the eyes with sterile distilled water or an isotonic sodium chloride solution will further minimize the radiation dose .
Since the eluate does not contain an antimicrobial agent , it should not be used after 12 hours from time of generator elution .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No long - term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or whether Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m may affect fertility in males or females .
Pregnancy In animal reproductive studies , Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m ( as free pertechnetate ) has been shown to cross the placental barrier .
It is not known whether Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity .
Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m should be given to pregnant women only if the expected benefits to be gained clearly outweigh the potential hazards .
Ideally , examinations using radiopharmaceutical drug products - especially those elective in nature - of women of childbearing capability should be performed during the first ten days following the onset of menses .
Nursing Mothers Technetium Tc - 99 m is excreted in human milk during lactation , therefore , formula - feedings should be substituted for breast - feedings .
Pediatric Use See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION sections .
Also see the description of additional risk under WARNINGS .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported infrequently following the administration of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m is administered by intravenous injection .
When imaging the nasolacrimal drainage system , instill the Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m by the use of a device such as a micropipette or similar method which will ensure the accuracy of the dose .
For imaging the urinary bladder and ureters ( direct isotopic cystography ) , the Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m is administered by direct instillation aseptically into the bladder via a urethral catheter , following which the catheter is flushed with approximately 200 mL of sterile saline directly into the bladder .
The suggested dose ranges employed for various diagnostic indications in the average ADULT PATIENT ( 70 kg ) are as follows : Vesico - ureteral imaging : 18 . 5 to 37 MBq ( 0 . 5 to 1 mCi ) Thyroid gland imaging : 37 to 370 MBq ( 1 to 10 mCi ) Salivary gland imaging : 37 to 185 MBq ( 1 to 5 mCi ) Nasolacrimal drainage system : Maximum dose of 3 . 7 MBq ( 100 µCi ) The recommended dosages in PEDIATRIC PATIENTS are : Vesico - ureteral imaging : 18 . 5 to 37 MBq ( 0 . 5 to 1 mCi ) Thyroid gland imaging : 2 . 22 to 2 . 96 MBq ( 60 to 80 µCi ) per kg body weight The patient dose should be measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit .
If the solution is discolored , discontinue use of the generator immediately .
The solution to be administered as the patient dose should be clear , colorless , and contain no particulate matter .
Radiation Dosimetry The estimated absorbed radiation doses to an average ADULT and PEDIATRIC patient from an intravenous injection of various doses of Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m distributed uniformly in the total body are shown in Tables 5 and 6 .
