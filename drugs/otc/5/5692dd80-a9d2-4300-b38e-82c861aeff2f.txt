For All General Irrigation , Washing , Rinsing and Dilution Purposes Not For Injection By Usual Parenteral Routes Flexible Irrigation Container Semi - rigid Irrigation Container Rx only DESCRIPTION These products are sterile , nonpyrogenic solutions of electrolytes in water for injection intended only for sterile irrigation , washing , rinsing and dilution purposes .
Each 100 mL of 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation , USP contains : Sodium chloride 900 mg ; pH 5 . 6 ( 4 . 5 to 7 . 0 ) .
May contain sodium hydroxide and / or hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment .
The solution is isotonic ( 308 mOsmol / liter , CALC . )
and has the following electrolyte content ( mEq / liter ) : Na + 154 ; Cl − 154 .
These irrigations contain no bacteriostat , antimicrobial agent or added buffer and are intended only for use as single - dose or short procedure irrigation .
When smaller volumes are required the unused portion should be discarded .
Each of these irrigations may be classified as a sterile irrigant , wash , rinse , diluent and pharmaceutical vehicle .
Sodium Chloride , USP is chemically designated NaCl , a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water .
Water for Injection , USP is chemically designated H2O .
The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinylchloride .
Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly .
The semi - rigid container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyolefin .
It is a copolymer of ethylene and propylene .
The container requires no vapor barrier to maintain the proper drug concentration .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts ; however , biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials .
Exposure to temperatures above 25 ° C / 77 ° F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content .
Higher temperatures lead to greater losses .
It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Each of these irrigation solutions exert a mechanical cleansing action for sterile irrigation of body cavities , tissues or wounds , indwelling urethral catheters and surgical drainage tubes and for washing , rinsing or soaking surgical dressings , instruments and laboratory specimens .
Each also serves as a diluent or vehicle for drugs used for irrigation or other pharmaceutical preparations .
0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation , USP provides an isotonic saline irrigation identical in composition with 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP ( normal saline ) .
0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Irrigation , USP is considered generally compatible with living tissues and organs .
Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium ( Na + ) and chloride ( Cl − ) ions .
Sodium ( Na + ) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances .
Chloride ( Cl − ) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells .
The distribution and excretion of sodium ( Na + ) and chloride ( Cl − ) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output .
Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70 % of total body weight .
Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters ( 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production ) .
Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms .
Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium ( Na + ) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Each of these solutions is indicated for all general irrigation , washing , rinsing and dilution purposes which permit use of a sterile , nonpyrogenic electrolyte solution .
CONTRAINDICATIONS NOT FOR INJECTION BY USUAL PARENTERAL ROUTES .
An electrolyte solution should not be used for irrigation during electrosurgical procedures .
WARNINGS FOR IRRIGATION ONLY .
NOT FOR INJECTION .
Entry of a hypotonic solution into the circulation may cause hemolysis .
Irrigating fluids have been demonstrated to enter the systemic circulation in relatively large volumes ; thus each of these irrigations must be regarded as a systemic drug .
Absorption of large amounts can cause fluid and / or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of administered parenteral solutions .
The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of such solutions .
Do not heat container over 66 ° C ( 150 ° F ) .
PRECAUTIONS Do not use for irrigation that may result in absorption into the blood .
Caution should be observed when a hypotonic solution is used for continuous irrigation or allowed to " dwell " inside body cavities because of possible absorption into the blood stream and the production of intravascular hemolysis and circulatory overload .
Aseptic technique is essential with the use of sterile solutions for irrigation of body cavities , wounds and urethral catheters or for wetting dressings that come in contact with body tissues .
When used as a " pour " irrigation , no part of the contents should be allowed to contact the surface below the outer protected thread area of the semi - rigid wide mouth container .
The flexible container is designed for use with nonvented irrigation sets .
When used for irrigation via irrigation equipment , the administration set should be attached promptly .
Unused portions should be discarded and a fresh container of appropriate size used for the start - up of each cycle or repeat procedure .
For repeated irrigations of urethral catheters , a separate container should be used for each patient .
Do not administer unless solution is clear , seal is intact and container is undamaged .
Discard unused portion .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : Studies with Sodium Chloride Irrigation , USP have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , mutagenic potential , or effects on fertility .
Nursing Mothers : Caution should be exercised when Sodium Chloride Irrigation , USP is administered to a nursing woman .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects .
Pregnancy Category C . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Sodium Chloride Irrigation , USP .
It is also not known whether Sodium Chloride Irrigation , USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Sodium Chloride Irrigation , USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Pediatric Use : Safety and effectiveness of Sodium Chloride irrigation solution in pediatric patients have not been established by adequate and well - controlled trials .
However , the use of Sodium Chloride irrigation solution in the pediatric population is referenced in the medical literature .
The Warnings , Precautions , and Adverse Reactions identified in the label should be observed in the pediatric population .
Geriatric Use : An evaluation of current literature revealed no clinical experience identifying differences in response between elderly and younger patients .
This drug is known to be substantially secreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Possible adverse effects arising from the irrigation of body cavities , tissues , or indwelling catheters and tubes are usually avoidable when proper procedures are followed .
Displaced catheters or drainage tubes can lead to irrigation or infiltration of unintended structures or cavities .
Excessive volume or pressure during irrigation of closed cavities may cause undue distension or disruption of tissues .
Accidental contamination from careless technique may transmit infection .
Should any adverse reaction occur , discontinue the irrigant , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of overhydration or solute overload , re - evaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective measures .
See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , and ADVERSE REACTIONS .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dose is dependent upon the capacity or surface area of the structure to be irrigated and the nature of the procedure .
When used as a diluent or vehicle for other drugs , the manufacturer ' s recommendations should be followed .
Drug Interactions Additives may be incompatible .
Consult with pharmacist , if available .
When introducing additives , use aseptic technique , mix thoroughly and do not store .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution container permits .
See PRECAUTIONS .
