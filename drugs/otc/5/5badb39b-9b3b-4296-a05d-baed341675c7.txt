The imprinting ink contains Titanium Dioxide .
Chemically , dicyclomine hydrochloride is [ bicyclohexyl ] - 1 - carboxylic acid , 2 - ( diethylamino ) ethyl ester , hydrochloride with the structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Dicyclomine hydrochloride occurs as a fine , white , crystalline , practically odorless powder with a bitter taste .
It is soluble in water , freely soluble in alcohol and chloroform , and very slightly soluble in ether .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Dicyclomine relieves smooth muscle spasm of the gastrointestinal tract .
Animal studies indicate that this action is achieved via a dual mechanism : ( 1 ) a specific anticholinergic effect ( antimuscarinic ) at the acetylcholine - receptor sites with approximately 1 / 8 the milligram potency of atropine ( in vitro , guinea pig ileum ) ; and ( 2 ) a direct effect upon smooth muscle ( musculotropic ) as evidenced by dicyclomine ' s antagonism of bradykinin - and histamine - induced spasms of the isolated guinea pig ileum .
Atropine did not affect responses to these two agonists .
In vivo studies in cats and dogs showed dicyclomine to be equally potent against acetylcholine ( ACh ) - or barium chloride ( BaCl2 ) - induced intestinal spasm while atropine was at least 200 times more potent against effects of ACh than BaCl2 .
Tests for mydriatic effects in mice showed that dicyclomine was approximately 1 / 500 as potent as atropine ; antisialagogue tests in rabbits showed dicyclomine to be 1 / 300 as potent as atropine .
In man , dicyclomine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration , reaching peak values within 60 - 90 minutes .
The principal route of elimination is via the urine ( 79 . 5 % of the dose ) .
Excretion also occurs in the feces , but to a lesser extent ( 8 . 4 % ) .
Mean half - life of plasma elimination in one study was determined to be approximately 1 . 8 hours when plasma concentrations were measured for 9 hours after a single dose .
In subsequent studies , plasma concentrations were followed for up to 24 hours after a single dose , showing a secondary phase of elimination with a somewhat longer half - life .
Mean volume of distribution for a 20 mg oral dose is approximately 3 . 65 L / kg suggesting extensive distribution in tissues .
In controlled clinical trials involving over 100 patients who received drug , 82 % of patients treated for functional bowel / irritable bowel syndrome with dicyclomine hydrochloride at initial doses of 160 mg daily ( 40 mg q . i . d . ) demonstrated a favorable clinical response compared with 55 % treated with placebo .
( p less than . 05 ) .
In these trials , most of the side effects were typically anticholinergic in nature and were reported by 61 % of the patients .
Nine percent ( 9 % ) of patients were discontinued from the drug because of one or more of these side effects ( compared with 2 % in the placebo group ) .
In 41 % of the patients with side effects , side effects disappeared or were tolerated at the 160 mg daily dose without reduction .
A dose reduction from 160 mg daily to an average daily dose of 90 mg was required in 46 % of the patients with side effects who then continued to experience a favorable clinical response ; their side effects either disappeared or were tolerated .

In this instance , treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful .
Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness or blurred vision .
The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness , such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or performing hazardous work while taking this drug .
Psychosis has been reported in sensitive individuals given anticholinergic drugs .
CNS signs and symptoms include confusion , disorientation , short - term memory loss , hallucinations , dysarthria , ataxia , coma , euphoria , decreased anxiety , fatigue , insomnia , agitation and mannerisms , and inappropriate affect .
These CNS signs and symptoms usually resolve within 12 to 24 hours after discontinuation of the drug .
There are reports that administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride syrup to infants has been followed by serious respiratory symptoms ( dyspnea , shortness of breath , breathlessness , respiratory collapse , apnea , asphyxia ) , seizures , syncope , pulse rate fluctuations , muscular hypotonia , and coma .
Death has been reported .
No causal relationship between these effects observed in infants and dicyclomine administration has been established .
DICYCLOMINE IS CONTRAINDICATED IN INFANTS LESS THAN 6 MONTHS OF AGE AND IN NURSING MOTHERS .

Minimum Human Lethal Dose / Maximum Human Dose Recorded : The amount of drug in a single dose that is ordinarily associated with symptoms of overdosage or that is likely to be life threatening , has not been defined .
The maximum human oral dose recorded was 600 mg by mouth in a 10 - month - old child and approximately 1500 mg in an adult , each of whom survived .
In three of the infants who died following administration of dicyclomine hydrochloride ( see WARNINGS ) , the blood concentrations of drug were 200 , 220 , and 505 ng / mL , respectively .
Dialysis : It is not known if dicyclomine hydrochloride is dialyzable .
Treatment : Treatment should consist of gastric lavage , emetics , and activated charcoal .
Sedatives ( e . g . , short - acting barbiturates , benzodiazepines ) may be used for management of overt signs of excitement .
If indicated , an appropriate parenteral cholinergic agent may be used as an antidote .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION DOSAGE MUST BE ADJUSTED TO INDIVIDUAL PATIENT NEEDS .
( See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY . )
Adults - Oral The only oral dose clearly shown to be effective is 160 mg per day ( in 4 equally divided doses ) .
Since this dose is associated with a significant incidence of side effects , it is prudent to begin with 80 mg per day ( in 4 equally divided doses ) .
Depending upon the patient ' s response during the first week of therapy , the dose should be increased to 160 mg per day unless side effects limit dosage escalation .
If efficacy is not achieved within 2 weeks or side effects require doses below 80 mg per day , the drug should be discontinued .
Documented safety data are not available for doses above 80 mg daily for periods longer than 2 weeks .

Eatontown , NJ 07724 Revised September 2008 Information for Patients : Dicyclomine hydrochloride may produce drowsiness or blurred vision .
The patient should be warned not to engage in activities requiring mental alertness , such as operating a motor vehicle or other machinery or to perform hazardous work while taking this drug .
Dicyclomine is contraindicated in infants less than 6 months of age and in nursing mothers .
( See CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS : Nursing Mothers and Pediatric Use . )
In the presence of a high environmental temperature , heat prostration can occur with drug use ( fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating ) .
If symptoms occur , the drug should be discontinued and a physician contacted .
Drug Interactions : The following agents may increase certain actions or side effects of anticholinergic drugs : amantadine , antiarrhythmic agents of Class 1 ( e . g . , quinidine ) , antihistamines , antipsychotic agents ( e . g . , phenothiazines ) , benzodiazepines , MAO inhibitors , narcotic analgesics ( e . g . , meperidine ) , nitrates and nitrites , sympathomimetic agents , tricyclic antidepressants , and other drugs having anticholinergic activity .
Anticholinergics antagonize the effects of antiglaucoma agents .
Anticholinergic drugs in the presence of increased intraocular pressure may be hazardous when taken concurrently with agents such as corticosteroids .
( See also CONTRAINDICATIONS . )
Anticholinergic agents may affect gastrointestinal absorption of various drugs , such as slowly dissolving dosage forms of digoxin ; increased serum digoxin concentrations may result .
Anticholinergic drugs may antagonize the effects of drugs that alter gastrointestinal motility , such as metoclopramide .
Because antacids may interfere with the absorption of anticholinergic agents , simultaneous use of these drugs should be avoided .
The inhibiting effects of anticholinergic drugs on gastric hydrochloric acid secretion are antagonized by agents used to treat achlorhydria and those used to test gastric secretion .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility : There are no known human data on long - term potential for carcinogenicity or mutagenicity .
Long - term studies in animals to determine carcinogenic potential are not known to have been conducted .
In studies in rats at doses of up to 100 mg / kg / day , dicyclomine hydrochloride produced no deleterious effects on breeding , conception , or parturition .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 33 times the maximum recommended human dose based on 160 mg / day ( 3 mg / kg ) and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to dicyclomine .
Epidemiologic studies in pregnant women with products containing dicyclomine hydrochloride ( at doses up to 40 mg / day ) have not shown that dicyclomine increases the risk of fetal abnormalities if administered during the first trimester of pregnancy .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women at the recommended doses ( 80 - 160 mg / day ) .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response , dicyclomine hydrochloride as indicated for functional bowel / irritable bowel syndrome should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers : Since dicyclomine hydrochloride has been reported to be excreted in human milk , DICYCLOMINE HYDROCHLORIDE IS CONTRAINDICATED IN NURSING MOTHERS .
( See CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS : Pediatric Use and ADVERSE REACTIONS . )
Pediatric Use : ( See CONTRAINDICATIONS , WARNINGS , and PRECAUTIONS : Nursing Mothers . )
DICYCLOMINE HYDROCHLORIDE IS CONTRAINDICATED IN INFANTS LESS THAN 6 MONTHS OF AGE .
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Geriatric Use : Clinical studies of dicyclomine hydrochloride did not include sufficient time of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
