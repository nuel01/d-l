Do not store the tablet for future use after the blister has been opened .
• Avoid the use of CUVRIOR in patients who are unable to swallow tablets .
2 . 3 Switching to CUVRIOR from Other Trientine Products CUVRIOR is not substitutable on a milligram - per - milligram basis with other trientine products .
If switching a patient from a trientine hydrochloride formulation to CUVRIOR , note that the content of the active moiety ( trientine base ) is not the same as CUVRIOR .
A 250 mg capsule of trientine hydrochloride contains 167 mg of trientine base ; in contrast , each 300 mg tablet of CUVRIOR contains 150 mg of trientine base [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 4 Clinical Monitoring and Laboratory Monitoring of Copper Adjust the total daily dosage of CUVRIOR according to clinical assessment and serum non - ceruloplasmin copper ( NCC ) levels .
Evaluate serum NCC levels when initiating CUVRIOR treatment , after 3 months of treatment and approximately every 6 months thereafter .
Therapy may also be monitored periodically ( every 6 to 12 months ) with measurement of 24 - hour urinary copper excretion ( UCE ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) ] .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Tablets : 300 mg of trientine tetrahydrochloride ( equivalent to 150 mg of trientine ) , oblong , yellow coated , functionally scored , printed with OL75 on each side of score line in black ink .
Each large carton contains nine small cartons , each containing a blister pack of 8 tablets ( a total of 72 tablets in the large carton ) .

( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS CUVRIOR is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to trientine or to any of the excipients in CUVRIOR [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Hypersensitivity to trientine or to any of the excipients in CUVRIOR .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Potential for Worsening of Clinical Symptoms at Initiation of Therapy : May include neurological deterioration .
Adjust dosage or discontinue CUVRIOR if clinical condition worsens .
( 5 . 1 ) • Copper Deficiency : Periodic monitoring is required .
( 5 . 2 ) • Iron Deficiency : If iron deficiency develops , a short course of iron supplementation may be given .
( 5 . 3 , 7 . 1 ) • Hypersensitivity Reactions : If rash or other hypersensitivity reaction occurs , consider discontinuing CUVRIOR .
( 5 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Potential for Worsening of Clinical Symptoms at Initiation of Therapy Worsening of clinical symptoms , including neurological deterioration , may occur at the beginning of CUVRIOR therapy due to mobilization of excess stores of copper .
Adjust the dosage or discontinue CUVRIOR if the patient ' s clinical condition worsens .
Evaluate serum non - ceruloplasmin copper ( NCC ) levels when initiating CUVRIOR treatment , after 3 months of treatment and approximately every 6 months thereafter .
Therapy may also be monitored periodically ( every 6 to 12 months ) with measurement of 24 - hour urinary copper excretion ( UCE ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 2 Copper Deficiency Copper deficiency may develop following treatment with CUVRIOR .
Close monitoring for manifestations of copper deficiency is required particularly when copper requirements may change , such as in pregnancy , where appropriate control of copper levels are required to ensure proper growth and mental development [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 3 Iron Deficiency Iron deficiency may develop following treatment with CUVRIOR , especially in menstruating or pregnant women , or as a result of the low copper diet recommended for Wilson ' s disease .
If necessary , iron may be given in short courses , but at least two hours should elapse between administration of CUVRIOR and iron [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions , characterized by rash , have been reported with the use of trientine .
In Trial 1 , rash was reported in 12 % ( 3 / 26 ) of CUVRIOR - treated patients , and one of these patients discontinued CUVRIOR because of the rash [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
If a patient develops a rash or other hypersensitivity reaction during treatment with CUVRIOR , assess clinically and consider discontinuing CUVRIOR [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • Potential for Worsening of Clinical Symptoms at Initiation of Therapy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Copper Deficiency [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Iron Deficiency [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( > 5 % ) are abdominal pain , change of bowel habits , rash , alopecia , and mood swings .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Common Adverse Reactions Table 3 presents common adverse reactions over a 24 - week period from Trial 1 , a prospective , randomized , multi - center study that was conducted in adult patients with Wilson ' s disease who were de - coppered and tolerant to penicillamine [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Patients were either switched to receive CUVRIOR ( N = 26 ) or continued to receive penicillamine ( N = 27 ) .

[ 2 ] Abdominal pain is composed of several similar terms [ 3 ] Includes constipation , abnormal feces , soft feces [ 4 ] Rash is composed of several similar terms Other Adverse Reactions In Trial 1 , anemia developed in 4 % ( 1 / 26 ) of CUVRIOR - treated patients and in no patients who continued to receive penicillamine .
In addition , the following adverse reactions have been reported in clinical studies of patients with Wilson ' s disease who were on therapy with trientine hydrochloride : • Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders : Iron deficiency • Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : Systemic lupus erythematosus 6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of trientine hydrochloride .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure : • Gastrointestinal Disorders : Colitis • Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : Muscle spasms , Rhabdomyolysis • Nervous System Disorders : Dystonia , Myasthenia gravis 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Mineral Supplements ( e . g . iron , zinc , calcium , magnesium ) : Avoid concomitant use .
If concomitant use is unavoidable ( 2 . 2 , 7 . 1 ) : • Iron : Take CUVRIOR at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after iron .
• Other Mineral Supplements : Take CUVRIOR at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after other mineral supplements .
• Other Drugs for Oral Administration : Take CUVRIOR at least 1 hour apart from any other oral drug .
( 2 . 2 , 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Mineral Supplements and Other Oral Drugs CUVRIOR has the potential to chelate non - copper cations in mineral supplements and other oral drugs , and could be rendered ineffective prior to systemic absorption .
Mineral Supplements Avoid concomitant use of mineral supplements such as iron , zinc , calcium , or magnesium with CUVRIOR because they may reduce the absorption of CUVRIOR .
However , if iron deficiency develops [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] , iron supplementation may be given in short courses , but because iron and CUVRIOR each inhibit absorption of the other , administer CUVRIOR at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after administration of an iron supplement [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
If concomitant use of other mineral supplements is unavoidable , administer CUVRIOR at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after administration of other mineral supplements .
Other Drugs for Oral Administration Administer CUVRIOR at least 1 hour apart from any other oral drug .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published literature and postmarketing experience over several decades with use of trientine for the treatment of Wilson ' s disease have not identified any drug - associated risks for major birth defects , miscarriages , or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Untreated Wilson ' s disease may result in worsening disease symptoms during pregnancy and increase the risk of miscarriages in some symptomatic patients ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of trientine in rats during organogenesis resulted in increased embryo - fetal loss at a dose lower than the maximum recommended dose and produced fetal abnormalities at 2 . 7 times the maximum recommended dose .
Copper supplementation in pregnant rats produced a marked reduction in trientine - induced fetal abnormalities .
Oral administration of trientine dihydrochloride to pregnant mice during organogenesis increased the percentage of mice with total embryo - fetal loss at approximately 4 . 3 times the maximum recommended dose and produced fetal abnormalities at approximately 1 . 1 times the maximum recommended dose .
The mechanism of embryo - fetal harm ( e . g . , copper depletion ) was not determined in the mouse study [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) and Data ] .
Monitor copper levels throughout pregnancy and use the minimum effective dosage of CUVRIOR throughout pregnancy .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - Associated Maternal and / or Embryo / Fetal Risk Untreated Wilson ' s disease or discontinuation of treatment during pregnancy may result in worsening neurological and hepatic symptoms , including rare reports of hepatic decompensation and liver failure .
Untreated Wilson ' s disease may also increase the risk of miscarriage in some symptomatic patients .
Increased copper deposition in the placenta and fetal liver may adversely impact the fetus .
Maternal Adverse Reactions Trientine may chelate non - copper cations ( e . g . , iron , calcium ) .
Maintain appropriate levels during pregnancy [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 3 ) , and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Fetal / Neonatal Adverse Reactions Chelator - induced copper deficiency may have adverse effects on the fetus .
Data Animal Data In embryo - fetal development studies in rats , trientine was administered orally at doses up to approximately 835 mg / kg / day during organogenesis .
An increased incidence of resorptions was observed at a dose lower than the maximum recommended dose ( 1 , 500 mg / day trientine free base equivalent ) , based on body surface area .
An increased incidence of fetal abnormalities , including hemorrhage and edema , was observed at 2 . 7 times the maximum recommended dose , based on body surface area .
When pregnant rats were treated with trientine and supplemented with copper ( concentration of 50 mcg / g in the diet ) , fetal abnormalities were markedly reduced , indicating that the mechanism of embryo - fetal harm in rats with no copper supplementation was based on copper depletion ( primary pharmacology of trientine ) .
In embryo - fetal development studies in mice , trientine dihydrochloride was administered orally at doses up to approximately 2 , 000 mg / kg / day during organogenesis .
A dose - dependent increase in the incidence of abnormal fetuses occurred at all doses .
Fetal abnormalities included hemorrhages and delayed ossification which were observed starting at 500 mg / kg / day , microcephaly and hydrocephaly starting at 1 , 000 mg / kg / day , and exencephaly at 2 , 000 mg / kg / day ( the doses were 1 . 1 , 2 . 1 , and 4 . 3 times the maximum recommended dose , respectively , based on body surface area ) .
The percentage of dams with total resorption was increased at 2 , 000 mg / kg / day ( 5 . 3 times the maximum recommended dose based on body surface area ) .
The mechanism of embryo - fetal harm ( e . g . copper depletion ) was not determined in this study .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary The available published data are inconsistent regarding the detection of trientine in breastmilk .
Available published literature have not reported drug - associated adverse effects in infants exposed to trientine through breastmilk .
There are no data on the effects of trientine on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for CUVRIOR and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from CUVRIOR or from the underlying condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of CUVRIOR in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In Trial 1 , of the total number of CUVRIOR - treated patients , 1 ( 4 % ) was 65 years of age and older [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Clinical studies with trientine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients .
Other reported clinical experience with trientine is insufficient to determine differences in responses between geriatric and younger adult patients .
In general , dose selection should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
10 OVERDOSAGE Occasional cases of trientine overdose have been reported .
A large overdose of 60 g of trientine hydrochloride ( equivalent to 80 g CUVRIOR ) resulted in nausea , vomiting , dizziness , mild acute kidney injury , mild hypophosphatemia , low serum zinc , and low serum copper .
The patient recovered following intravenous hydration and supportive measures .
There is no antidote for trientine acute overdose .
Chronic use of trientine hydrochloride at dosages above the maximum recommended dosage has resulted in sideroblastic anemia .
11 DESCRIPTION CUVRIOR contains trientine tetrahydrochloride which is a salt of trientine , a copper chelator .
The structural formula of trientine tetrahydrochloride is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Molecular Formula C6H22Cl4N4 Molecular Weight 292 . 08 g mol - 1 CUVRIOR ( trientine tetrahydrochloride ) tablets are for oral administration and contain 300 mg of trientine tetrahydrochloride ( equivalent to 150 mg trientine ) .
Tablets include the following inactive ingredients : colloidal silicon dioxide , glyceryl dibehenate , and mannitol .
The film coating comprises ferric oxide yellow , glyceryl monocaprylocaprate ( Type I ) , polyvinyl alcohol , purified talc , sodium lauryl sulfate , and titanium dioxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Trientine , a copper chelator , eliminates absorbed copper from the body by forming a stable complex that is then eliminated through urinary excretion .
Trientine also chelates copper in the intestinal tract , reducing copper absorption .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In Trial 1 , serum non - ceruloplasmin copper ( NCC ) and 24 - hour urinary copper excretion ( UCE ) were measured in adult patients with Wilson ' s disease who were de - coppered and tolerating penicillamine and who had switched to CUVRIOR .
In patients who had switched to CUVRIOR , mean UCE decreased over time ( see Table 4 ) .
On the other hand , the mean serum NCC in patients who had switched to CUVRIOR was comparable to the mean serum NCC in patients who remained on penicillamine [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .

The median time to the peak concentration ( Tmax ) of trientine ranged from 1 . 25 to 2 hours .
Mean ( ± standard deviation ) maximum plasma concentrations ( Cmax ) after 900 mg and 1 , 500 mg CUVRIOR were 2030 ± 981 , and 3430 ± 1480 ng / mL , respectively .
The systemic exposure ( AUC ) of trientine increased in a dose proportional manner over the range of 900 mg to 1 , 500 mg ( mean AUCinf of 9750 ± 4910 and 17200 ± 9470 ng ∙ h / mL , respectively ) .
After administration of 900 mg ( 3 tablets ) of CUVRIOR , the mean AUC was 11 % lower compared to 750 mg ( 3 capsules ) of trientine hydrochloride .
After administration of 1 , 500 mg ( 5 tablets ) of CUVRIOR , the mean AUC was comparable to 1 , 250 mg ( 5 capsules ) of trientine hydrochloride [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Elimination The mean terminal half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of trientine ranged from 13 . 8 to 16 . 5 hours .
Metabolism Trientine is acetylated into two major active metabolites , N ( 1 ) - acetyltriethylenetetramine ( MAT ) and N ( 1 ) , N ( 10 ) - diacetyltriethylenetetramine ( DAT ) .
After the administration of a 900 mg dose of CUVRIOR , mean Cmax of MAT and DAT respectively were 1450 ± 471 and 500 ± 467 ng / mL and mean AUCinf was 15400 ± 4200 and 5970 ± 3390 ng ∙ h / mL .
Mean T1 / 2 was 17 . 1 ± 9 . 22 and 14 . 7 ± 8 . 39 hours for MAT and DAT , respectively .
After the administration of a 1 , 500 mg dose of CUVRIOR , mean Cmax of MAT and DAT respectively were 2050 ± 596 and 683 ± 632 ng / mL and mean AUCinf was 22000 ± 5770 and 7690 ± 3970 ng ∙ h / mL .
Mean T1 / 2 was 19 . 3 ± 12 . 3 and 11 . 2 ± 3 . 30 hours for MAT and DAT , respectively .
Excretion Trientine and its metabolites are excreted in the urine .
Specific Populations Male and Female Patients Following a single oral dose of 900 mg CUVRIOR , the systemic exposures ( Cmax and AUCinf ) were similar between males and females , although males appeared to have higher systemic exposures of trientine ( approximately 30 % and 50 % higher for Cmax and AUCinf , respectively ) following a single oral dose of 1 , 500 mg of CUVRIOR .
This difference is not considered clinically meaningful for CUVRIOR .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Oral carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with trientine .
Mutagenesis Trientine was positive in the bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay , the in vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in rat hepatocytes , and the sister - chromatid exchange assay in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells .
Trientine was negative in the HGPRT gene mutation assay in CHO cells and the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
Impairment of Fertility Fertility studies have not been conducted with trientine .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Severe pulmonary toxicity occurred in a 26 - week oral toxicity study of trientine dihydrochloride in rats .
However , the relevance of this finding to safety risk in patients with Wilson ' s disease is unknown .
Deaths related to pulmonary injury occurred in male rats at 175 and 600 mg / kg / day ( 1 / 12 and 3 / 20 males , respectively ) .
Pulmonary lesions were observed in male rats at 50 mg / kg / day ( lower than the maximum recommended dose [ 1 , 500 mg / day trientine free base equivalent ] based on body surface area ) .
In female rats , pulmonary lesions occurred at 175 mg / kg / day ( lower than the maximum recommended dose based on body surface area ) .
Pulmonary toxicity was dose - dependent in both sexes .
The lesions included alveolar fibrosis , bronchiolar hyperplasia / epithelialization of alveolar wall , focal chronic interstitial pneumonitis , bronchiolar epithelium hypertrophy , alveolar hemorrhage ( males only ) , necrosis / regenerative hyperplasia of terminal bronchioles ( males only ) , and acute interstitial pneumonitis ( males only ) .
Most of the pulmonary lesions remained after a 13 - week recovery period , and were considered as irreversible ( e . g . , alveolar fibrosis , bronchiolar hyperplasia / epithelialization of alveolar wall , focal chronic interstitial pneumonitis ) .
Pulmonary toxicity also occurred in a 13 - week oral study of trientine dihydrochloride in mice .
The effects included interstitial inflammation and alveolar histiocytic infiltration , observed at a dose approximately equal to the maximum recommended dose based on body surface area .
The mechanism of pulmonary toxicity was not clearly established as due to copper depletion ( primary pharmacology ) or due to other drug activity .
Neurological and / or musculoskeletal clinical signs ( abnormal " stiff - legged " gait , limited use of limb , underactivity , body tremors ) occurred in a 26 - week oral toxicity study of trientine dihydrochloride in dogs at 5 . 5 times the estimated human exposure at the maximum recommended dose ( based on AUC ) .
The mechanism for these clinical signs was not clearly established as due to copper depletion ( primary pharmacology ) or due to other drug activity .
Because of the severity of the clinical signs at exposures above 5 . 5 times the maximum exposure in humans , some dogs were sacrificed for humane reasons after 9 weeks of treatment , and treatment for the remaining animals in the same dose group was stopped after 10 weeks .
Neurological and / or musculoskeletal clinical signs were generally not observed at exposures that were 3 . 4 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended dose .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The effectiveness of CUVRIOR for the treatment of adult patients with stable Wilson ' s disease who are decoppered and tolerant to penicillamine was demonstrated in a phase 3 trial ( Trial 1 ) .
In addition , the safety and effectiveness of CUVRIOR in Wilson ' s Disease is further supported by studies of another trientine product in patients intolerant to penicillamine .
Trial 1 was a randomized , active - controlled , multi - center , non - inferiority study ( NCT03539952 ) conducted in 53 adult patients with Wilson ' s disease .
The objective was to compare treatment with CUVRIOR to treatment with penicillamine .
All patients had been receiving penicillamine for at least 1 year prior to study entry , were adequately controlled and tolerating penicillamine , and had a serum NCC level between ≥ 25 and ≤ 150 mcg / L .
At the start of the study , patients entered a 12 - week baseline period and continued to receive their established total daily dosage of penicillamine for 12 weeks .
At Week 12 , patients were randomized to either remain on penicillamine ( N = 27 ) or to switch to CUVRIOR ( N = 26 ) for the 24 - week post - randomization period ( i . e . , Week 12 through Week 36 ) .
For patients switching to CUVRIOR , where possible , the initial total daily dosage was determined as the trientine base in mg that was the same as the patient ' s total daily dosage in mg of penicillamine .
Where a direct mg to mg conversion was not possible , the total daily dosage of CUVRIOR was rounded to the nearest 150 mg of trientine base ( 300 mg trientine tetrahydrochloride salt ) to the penicillamine total daily dosage .
The dosage was permitted to be adjusted depending on clinical response .
The mean CUVRIOR total daily dosage was 1 , 800 mg .
Upon switching from penicillamine to CUVRIOR , 3 patients switched to a CUVRIOR total daily dosage < 900 mg , 9 patients to a total daily dosage between 900 mg and 1 , 800 mg , and 14 patients to a total daily dosage of 1 , 800 mg or greater .
Three out of 26 patients increased and one patient reduced the total daily dosage across the 24 - week post - randomization period .
The results are presented in Table 5 .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean serum non - ceruloplasmin copper ( NCC ) level at 24 weeks post - randomization ( Week 36 ) .
At Week 12 ( prior to initiation of randomized treatment ) , the mean ( 95 % CI ) NCC levels in the penicillamine and CUVRIOR arms were 77 mcg / L ( 66 ; 88 ) and 66 mcg / L ( 55 ; 76 ) , respectively .
The mean NCC level at Week 36 as measured using an assay not commercially available was similar in patients receiving CUVRIOR and in patients receiving penicillamine .
However , the mean 24 - hour urinary copper excretion ( UCE ) at Week 36 was lower in patients receiving CUVRIOR as compared to patients receiving penicillamine .
