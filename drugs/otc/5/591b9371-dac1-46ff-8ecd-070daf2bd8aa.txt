( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : May cause fetal harm .
Advise patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use an effective non - hormonal method of contraception .
( 5 . 3 , 7 . 3 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Hepatotoxicity TURALIO can cause serious and potentially fatal liver injury and is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Hepatotoxicity with ductopenia and cholestasis occurred in patients treated with TURALIO .
Across 768 patients who received TURALIO in clinical trials , there were two irreversible cases of cholestatic liver injury .
One patient died with advanced cancer and ongoing liver toxicity and one patient required a liver transplant .
The mechanism of cholestatic hepatotoxicity is unknown and its occurrence cannot be predicted .
It is unknown whether liver injury occurs in the absence of increased transaminases .
In ENLIVEN , 3 of 61 ( 5 % ) patients who received TURALIO developed signs of serious liver injury , defined as ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN with total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN .
In these patients , peak ALT ranged from 6 to 9 × ULN , peak total bilirubin ranged from 2 . 5 to 15 × ULN , and alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) was ≥ 2 × ULN .
ALT , AST and total bilirubin improved to < 2 × ULN in these patients 1 to 7 months after discontinuing TURALIO .
Avoid TURALIO in patients with pre - existing increased serum transaminases ; total bilirubin or direct bilirubin ( > ULN ) ; or active liver or biliary tract disease , including increased ALP .
Taking TURALIO with food increases drug exposure by 100 % and may increase the risk of hepatotoxicity .
Administer TURALIO on an empty stomach , either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal or snack [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 , 12 . 3 ) ] .
Monitor liver tests , including AST , ALT , total bilirubin , direct bilirubin , ALP and gamma - glutamyl transferase ( GGT ) , prior to initiation of TURALIO , weekly for the first 8 weeks , every 2 weeks for the next month and every 3 months thereafter .
Withhold and dose reduce , or permanently discontinue TURALIO based on the severity of the hepatotoxicity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Rechallenge with a reduced dose of TURALIO may result in a recurrence of increased serum transaminases , bilirubin , or ALP .
Monitor liver tests weekly for the first month after rechallenge .
5 . 2 TURALIO REMS Program TURALIO is only available through a restricted program under a REMS , because of the risk of hepatotoxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Notable requirements of the TURALIO REMS Program include the following : • Prescribers must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training .
• Patients must complete and sign an enrollment form for inclusion in a patient registry .
• Pharmacies must be certified with the program and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive TURALIO .
Further information is available at www . TURALIOREMS . com or 1 - 833 - 887 - 2546 .
5 . 3 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on animal studies and its mechanism of action , TURALIO may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Oral administration of pexidartinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in malformations , increased post - implantation loss , and abortion at exposures approximately equal to the human exposure at the recommended dose of 800 mg based on area under the curve ( AUC ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non - hormonal contraception , since TURALIO can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective , during treatment with TURALIO and for 1 month after the final dose .
Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TURALIO and for 1 week after the final dose [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • Hepatotoxicity [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Most common adverse reactions ( > 20 % ) were increased lactate dehydrogenase , increased aspartate aminotransferase , hair color changes , fatigue , increased alanine aminotransferase , decreased neutrophils , increased cholesterol , increased alkaline phosphatase , decreased lymphocytes , eye edema , decreased hemoglobin , rash , dysgeusia , and decreased phosphate .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) • Renal Impairment : Reduce the dose for patients with mild to severe renal impairment .
( 2 . 6 , 8 . 6 ) • Hepatic Impairment : Reduce the dose for patients with moderate hepatic impairment .
( 2 . 7 , 8 . 7 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] , TURALIO may cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
The available human data do not establish the presence or absence of major birth defects or miscarriage related to the use of TURALIO .
Oral administration of pexidartinib to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis resulted in malformations , post - implantation loss , and abortion at maternal exposures that were approximately equal to the human exposure at the recommended dose of 800 mg ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Embryo - fetal development studies investigating the administration of pexidartinib during the period of organogenesis were conducted in rats and rabbits .
In rats , pexidartinib resulted in increased post - implantation loss and fetal malformations including localized fetal edema , absence of kidney and ureter , abnormalities of the reproductive tract , and developmental variations including misshapen kidney , decreased skeletal ossification and higher mean litter proportions of slightly or moderately malaligned sternebrae at doses of 40 mg / kg ( approximately equal to the human exposure at the recommended dose of 800 mg ) .
In rabbits , administration of pexidartinib resulted in increased post - implantation loss , abortion , and fetal malformations including absence of kidney or ureter , rudimentary , misshapen or malpositioned kidney , rib abnormalities , and skeletal variations of accessory skull bones at doses of 60 mg / kg ( approximately equal to the human exposure at the recommended dose of 800 mg ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of pexidartinib or its metabolites in either human or animal milk or its effects on a breastfed child or on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with TURALIO and for at least 1 week after the final dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential TURALIO may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to the initiation of TURALIO [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non - hormonal contraception during treatment with TURALIO and for 1 month after the final dose .
Counsel patients to use non - hormonal method ( s ) of contraception , since TURALIO can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Males Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TURALIO and for 1 week after the final dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Based on findings from animal studies , TURALIO may impair both male and female fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of TURALIO in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of TURALIO did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Reduce the dose when administering TURALIO to patients with mild to severe renal impairment ( CLcr 15 to 89 mL / min , estimated by Cockcroft - Gault [ C - G ] ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin less than or equal to upper limit of normal [ ULN ] with AST greater than ULN or total bilirubin greater than 1 and up to 1 . 5 times ULN with any AST ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Reduce the dosage of TURALIO for patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin greater than 1 . 5 and up to 3 times ULN , not due to Gilbert ' s syndrome , with any AST ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
TURALIO has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin greater than 3 to 10 times ULN and any AST ) .
10 OVERDOSAGE Due to the high plasma protein binding , TURALIO is not expected to be dialyzable [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION Pexidartinib is a kinase inhibitor .
The chemical name of pexidartinib hydrochloride is 5 - [ ( 5 - Chloro - 1 H - pyrrolo [ 2 , 3 - b ] pyridin - 3 - yl ) methyl ] - N - { [ 6 - ( trifluoromethyl ) pyridin - 3 - yl ] methyl } pyridin - 2 - amine monohydrochloride .
Pexidartinib hydrochloride is an off - white to white solid .
The molecular formula for pexidartinib hydrochloride is C20H15ClF3N5 ∙ HCl .
The molecular weight is 454 . 28 for the hydrochloride salt and 417 . 81 for the free base .
The chemical structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The solubility of pexidartinib hydrochloride in aqueous solutions decreases with increasing pH . The pKa1 and pKa2 were determined to be 2 . 6 and 5 . 4 respectively for the conjugate acids .
Pexidartinib hydrochloride is soluble in methanol , slightly soluble in water and ethanol , and practically insoluble in heptane .
TURALIO ( pexidartinib ) capsules are for oral use .
Each capsule contains 200 mg pexidartinib which is equivalent to 217 . 5 mg pexidartinib hydrochloride .
The capsule contains the following inactive ingredients : poloxamer 407 , mannitol , crospovidone , and magnesium stearate .
The hypromellose capsule shell contains hypromellose , titanium dioxide , black iron oxide and yellow iron oxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Pexidartinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets colony stimulating factor 1 receptor ( CSF1R ) , KIT proto - oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase ( KIT ) , and FMS - like tyrosine kinase 3 ( FLT3 ) harboring an internal tandem duplication ( ITD ) mutation .
Overexpression of the CSF1R ligand promotes cell proliferation and accumulation in the synovium .
In vitro , pexidartinib inhibited proliferation of cell lines dependent on CSF1R and ligand - induced autophosphorylation of CSF1R .
Pexidartinib also inhibited the proliferation of a CSF1R dependent cell line in vivo .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure - Response Relationships There is an exposure response relationship between pexidartinib steady state exposure and serum transaminase levels ( ALT and AST ) with a higher risk of increased serum transaminases at higher exposure .
Additionally , increased transaminases occurred more frequently with higher pexidartinib doses ( 200 to 1200 mg per day ) .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At two times the mean maximum exposure of the 400 mg twice daily dose , TURALIO does not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of TURALIO was evaluated following single doses in healthy subjects and following multiple doses in patients as summarized in Table 9 .
Table 9 : TURALIO Exposure and Pharmacokinetic ParametersGeneral Information Steady state exposure [ Mean ( SD ) ] [ 1 ] Cmax 8625 ( 2746 ) ng / mL AUC0 - 12 h 77465 ( 24975 ) ng ∙ h / mL Dose proportionality Pexidartinib exposure ( Cmax and AUC0 - INF ) increased linearly over the single oral dose range of 200 to 2400 mg ( 0 . 5 to 6 times the recommended dose ) .
Time to steady state [ 2 ] Approximately 7 days Accumulation ratio ( AUC ) [ Median ] null 3 . 6 Absorption Tmax [ Median ] 2 . 5 hours Effect of food Administration with high - fat meal [ 3 ] • Increased pexidartinib Cmax and AUC0 - INF by 100 % • Delayed Tmax by 2 . 5 hours Administration with low - fat meal [ 4 ] • Increased Cmax by 56 % and AUC0 - INF by 59 % • Delayed Tmax by 1 . 5 hours Distribution In vitro plasma protein binding • Greater than 99 % • Human serum albumin : 99 . 9 % • α - 1 acid glycoprotein : 89 . 9 % Apparent volume of distribution ( Vz / F ) [ Mean ( CV % ) ] [ 5 ] • 187 L ( 27 % ) Elimination Apparent clearance [ Mean ( CV % ) ] null • 5 . 1 L / h ( 36 % ) t1 / 2 [ Mean ( SD ) ] • 26 . 6 ( 6 . 5 ) hours Metabolism Primary pathway • Oxidation : CYP3A4 • Glucuronidation : UGT1A4 N - glucuronide metabolite • Major inactive metabolite formed by UGT1A4 • Approximately 10 % higher exposure than pexidartinib after a single dose Excretion [ 6 ] • Feces : 65 % ( 44 % as unchanged ) • Urine : 27 % as metabolites ( ≥ 10 % as N - glucuronide ) [ 1 ] Pexidartinib 400 mg twice daily [ 2 ] Estimated based on half life [ 3 ] The high - fat meal comprised 800 to 1000 calories with fat being 50 % of total caloric content ; approximately 150 calories from protein , 250 calories from carbohydrates , and 500 - 600 calories from fat .
[ 4 ] The low - fat meal comprised 387 calories with fat being approximately 25 % of total caloric content .
[ 5 ] After a single oral dose of pexidartinib 400 mg [ 6 ] After a single oral dose of radiolabeled pexidartinib 400 mg Specific Populations No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of pexidartinib were observed based on age ( 18 to 84 years ) , sex , race ( White and Black ) , or mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin ≤ ULN with AST > ULN or total bilirubin > 1 to 1 . 5 × ULN with any AST ) .
Patients with Renal Impairment Mild ( CLcr 60 to 89 mL / min ) , moderate ( CLcr 30 to 59 mL / min ) and severe ( CLcr 15 to 29 mL / min ) renal impairment increased pexidartinib exposure ( AUC ) by approximately 30 % , relative to that in patients with normal renal function ( CLcr ≥ 90 mL / min ) .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment Moderate hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 and up to 3 × ULN , not due to Gilbert ' s syndrome , with any AST ) increased pexidartinib exposure ( AUC ) by 43 % relative to exposure in patients with normal hepatic function ( total bilirubin and AST ≤ ULN ) .
The pharmacokinetics of pexidartinib have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 3 to 10 × ULN with any AST ) .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Model - Informed Approaches Effects of Other Drugs on Pexidartinib Strong CYP3A Inducers : Coadministration of rifampicin ( strong CYP3A inducer ) decreased pexidartinib Cmax by 33 % and AUC0 - INF by 65 % .
Moderate CYP3A Inducers : Coadministration of efavirenz ( moderate CYP3A inducer ) is predicted to decrease pexidartinib Cmax by 27 % and AUC by 38 % at steady state .
Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : Coadministration of itraconazole ( strong CYP3A inhibitor ) increased pexidartinib Cmax by 48 % and AUC0 - INF by 70 % .
Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors : Coadministration of fluconazole ( moderate CYP3A inhibitor ) is predicted to increase pexidartinib Cmax by 41 % and AUC by 67 % at steady state .
UGT Inhibitors : Coadministration of probenecid ( UGT inhibitor ) increased pexidartinib Cmax by 5 % and AUC0 - INF by 60 % .

The effects of H2 - receptor antagonists and locally - acting antacids on pexidartinib pharmacokinetics have not been studied .
Effects of Pexidartinib on Other Drugs CYP2C19 Substrates : Coadministration of a single oral dose of TURALIO 1800 mg ( 4 . 5 times the approved recommended dose of 400 mg ) decreased omeprazole ( CYP2C19 substrate ) Cmax by 37 % and AUC0 - INF by 17 % .
CYP3A Substrates : Coadministration of TURALIO 400 mg twice daily decreased midazolam ( CYP3A substrate ) Cmax by 28 % and AUC0 - INF by 59 % .
CYP2C9 Substrates : Coadministration of TURALIO 400 mg twice daily increased tolbutamide ( CYP2C9 substrate ) AUC0 - INF by 28 % .
The effect of pexidartinib on CYP2C9 substrates is not considered clinically relevant .
P - gp Substrates : Coadministration of a single oral dose of TURALIO 1800 mg ( 4 . 5 times the approved recommended dose of 400 mg ) increased digoxin ( P - gp substrate ) Cmax by 30 % and AUC0 - INF by 9 % .
CYP2C8 Substrates : The effect of pexidartinib on CYP2C8 substrates is predicted not to be clinically relevant .
In Vitro Studies CYP / UGT Enzymes : Pexidartinib is likely to inhibit CYP2B6 and induce CYP2B6 at clinically relevant concentrations .
Pexidartinib is likely to inhibit UGT1A1 at clinically relevant concentrations .
Transporter Systems : Pexidartinib is not a substrate for P - gp , BCRP , OAT1 , OAT3 , OCT1 , OCT2 , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OATP2B1 , and BSEP .
Pexidartinib is an inhibitor of MATE1 , MATE2 - K , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 and OATP2B1 .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies were performed in mice and rats .
Both studies were negative for carcinogenic findings at exposures up to 9 times the human exposure at the recommended daily dose of 800 mg based on AUC .
Pexidartinib was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation ( AMES ) assay or clastogenic in either an in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosomal aberrations assay or in an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay .
Based on nonclinical findings , TURALIO may impair male and female fertility .
In a fertility study in which pexidartinib was administered orally to male and female rats , there were reductions in pregnancy , as well as increases in pre - and post - implantation loss with a corresponding reduction in viable embryos at 40 mg / kg ( approximately 1 . 3 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 800 mg ) .
Males at this dose level displayed reductions in spermatogenic parameters and adverse effects on sperm concentration , production , motility , and morphology .
Lower testicular and epididymal weights occurred in this study at doses of ≥ 10 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 3 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 800 mg ) .
This is consistent with findings in chronic toxicology studies of germ cell depletion of the testes and hypospermia and cellular debris in the epididymis in male reproductive tissues of both rats and dogs at respective doses as low as 20 and 30 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 6 and 0 . 1 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 800 mg ) .
In rats , these changes persisted following a 16 - week recovery period at the 60 mg / kg / day dose level ( approximately 1 . 5 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 800 mg ) .
In female rats , necrosis of corpora lutea occurred at doses ≥ 0 . 5 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 01 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 800 mg ) with pigment deposition within the interstitium of the ovaries , an increased incidence of luteal cysts and incidence / severity of hemorrhage of corpora lutea , and a decreased incidence of retained antral follicles and decreased corpora lutea at 60 mg / kg ( approximately 1 . 8 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 800 mg ) .
In female dogs there were decreased follicle numbers and moderate atrophy of the oviduct , uterus , and cervix at doses as low as 1 mg / kg ( approximately 0 . 01 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 800 mg ) .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology In repeat dose toxicity studies of up to 26 weeks in rats , there were findings of myxomatous change in the skin , tongue , and gastrointestinal tract , lymphoid depletion of the bone marrow and thymus , and chronic progressive nephropathy of the kidney at 20 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 6 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 800 mg ) .
Similar changes occurred in the rat carcinogenicity study along with alterations in the tunica intima of the aorta .
Vascular inflammation consistent with polyarteritis nodosa occurred in male rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( approximately 1 . 5 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of 800 mg ) .
There were also dose - dependent findings of minimal to moderate subphyseal or cortical hyperostosis and physeal hypertrophy in the femur that correlated with decreased systemic phosphate levels at doses ≥ 60 mg / kg .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Tenosynovial Giant Cell Tumor The efficacy of TURALIO was evaluated in ENLIVEN ( NCT02371369 ) , a double - blind , randomized ( 1 : 1 ) , placebo - controlled , multicenter trial in patients with symptomatic TGCT [ also referred to as giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath ( GCT - TS ) or pigmented villonodular synovitis ( PVNS ) ] for whom surgical removal of the tumor would be associated with worsening functional limitation or severe morbidity .
Eligible patients were required to have measurable disease per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1 . 1 .
Patients were randomized to placebo or TURALIO 400 mg in the morning and 600 mg in the evening for 2 weeks followed by 400 mg twice daily .
Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression .
Randomization was stratified by geographic region ( US vs . non - US countries ) and disease location ( upper extremity vs . lower extremity involvement ) .
Patients who completed treatment in the double - blind , randomized part of the trial were eligible to advance to an open - label extension part in which all patients were given the option to receive pexidartinib .
The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate ( ORR ) as assessed by blinded independent central review ( BICR ) at Week 25 using RECIST v1 . 1 .
Additional efficacy outcome measures were mean change from baseline in range of motion of the affected joint at Week 25 and ORR as assessed by BICR at Week 25 using tumor volume score ( TVS ) .
Range of motion was measured as a percent of normal reference range for the affected joint .
Range of motion assessments were performed by a third - party clinical assessor using a goniometer .
TVS was defined in ENLIVEN as the estimated volume of the maximally distended synovial cavity or tendon sheath involved , measured in 10 % increments .
Patients in the placebo arm were offered TURALIO at Week 25 beginning with a 400 mg twice daily dose , as permitted by the study protocol .
A total of 120 patients were randomized , 61 to the TURALIO arm and 59 to the placebo arm .
The median age was 44 years ( range : 18 - 79 ) ; 59 % were females ; 88 % were White ; 53 % had prior surgery ; 88 % were diagnosed with diffuse TGCT ; and 9 % had previously been treated with systemic therapy .
Disease locations were knee ( 61 % ) , ankle ( 18 % ) , hip ( 11 % ) , wrist ( 3 % ) , foot ( 3 % ) and other ( 5 % ) .
ENLIVEN demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in ORR in patients randomized to TURALIO compared with placebo .
Efficacy results are summarized in Table 10 .
Table 10 : Efficacy Results Assessed at Week 25 for ENLIVENEfficacy Parameter TURALIO N = 61 Placebo N = 59 CI : confidence interval ; NA : not applicable ; SD : standard deviation ; LS : least squares ; + : denotes ongoing at last assessment Overall Response Rate ( ORR ) [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] ORR ( 95 % CI ) 38 % ( 27 % , 50 % ) 0 ( 0 , 6 % ) Complete Response 15 % 0 Partial Response 23 % 0 P - value [ 3 ] < 0 . 0001 Duration of Response ( DOR ) null Range ( months ) 6 . 9 + , 24 . 9 + NA [ 1 ] Blinded independent central review [ 2 ] Data cut - off date January 31 , 2018 [ 3 ] Fisher ' s exact test The analysis of mean change from baseline in range of motion at Week 25 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in patients randomized to TURALIO compared to placebo .
Figure 1 shows the change from baseline in range of motion for each patient at Week 25 ( TURALIO N = 45 , placebo N = 43 ) .
Results were excluded for 1 patient with missing baseline and 31 patients with a missing range of motion assessment at Week 25 .
Figure 1 : Change from Baseline in Range of Motion at Week 25 for ENLIVEN [ MULTIMEDIA ] ORR by TVS was 56 % ( 95 % CI : 43 % , 67 % ) in patients randomized to the TURALIO arm and 0 % in patients randomized to the placebo arm ; p < 0 . 0001 .
At completion of the open - label extension part of the study in which all patients received TURALIO , the ORR using RECIST v1 . 1 was 61 % ( 95 % CI : 48 % , 72 % ) in the 61 patients originally randomized to the TURALIO arm .
The median duration of response was not reached ( range : 4 . 6 + , 63 . 4 + months ) in the 37 responders .
