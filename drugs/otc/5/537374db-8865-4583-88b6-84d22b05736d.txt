( 2 . 3 ) 2 . 1 Important Dosage and Administration Instructions Depo - subQ provera 104 is only for subcutaneous administration and is only to be administered by a healthcare professional .
Use for longer than 2 years is not recommended ( unless other birth control methods or medical therapies for endometriosis - associated pain are considered inadequate ) due to the impact of long - term depo - subQ provera 104 treatment on bone mineral density ( BMD ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Prior to the first injection confirm that the patient is not pregnant .
For women who are sexually active and who have regular menses , administer the first injection only during the first 5 days of a normal menstrual period .
For women who are breast - feeding , administer the first injection during or after the sixth postpartum week .
The recommended dosage of depo - subQ provera 104 is 104 mg given subcutaneously every 12 to 14 weeks .
If more than 14 weeks elapse between injections , confirm that the patient is not pregnant before the next injection .
Instruct the patient that if they are unable to receive an injection within 12 – 14 weeks , another contraceptive method should be used until the next depo - subQ provera 104 injection .
The dosage does not need to be adjusted for body weight .
Inject the entire contents of the pre - filled syringe using strict aseptic technique into the upper anterior thigh or abdomen , rotating the sites with every injection [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 2 Switching from Another Method of Contraception When switching from another contraceptive method to depo - subQ provera 104 , administer depo - subQ provera 104 in a manner that ensures continuous contraceptive coverage .
Follow the respective recommendations when switching from the contraceptive methods listed below : • Combined hormonal contraceptives : administer the first injection of depo - subQ provera 104 within 7 days after the last day of using the combined hormonal contraceptive method ( i . e . , within 7 days after taking the last active pill ) .
• An implant : administer the first injection of depo - subQ provera 104 on the day of implant removal .
• A contraceptive vaginal ring or transdermal system : administer the first injection of depo - subQ provera 104 on the day the patient would have inserted the next ring or applied the next transdermal system .
• An Intrauterine Device ( IUD ) or Intrauterine System ( IUS ) : administer the first injection of depo - subQ provera 104 on the day of IUD / IUS removal .
If the IUD / IUS is not removed on the first day of the patient ' s menstrual cycle , instruct patients to use a non - hormonal back - up method of birth control for the first 7 days after administration of depo - subQ provera 104 .
• Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension for intramuscular use ( DMPA - IM ) : inject depo - subQ provera 104 12 to 14 weeks after the last dose of DMPA - IM .
2 . 3 Preparation and Administration Instructions Prior to injection : • Ensure all the components in Figure A are available and that depo - subQ provera 104 is at room temperature .
• Shake the pre - filled syringe vigorously prior to injection to ensure appropriate viscosity of the suspension .
• Inspect depo - subQ provera 104 visually for particulate matter and discoloration .
Figure A . Components in the Package [ MULTIMEDIA ] Step 1 : Select & Prepare the Injection Area • Select a preferred injection area , i . e . , the left or right upper thigh or the abdomen ( see shaded areas , Figure B ) .
• Avoid selection of bony areas and the umbilicus .
• Clean the skin in the injection area you have chosen with a clean cotton pad or clean paper tissue .
• Rotate the injection site by injecting into a different puncture site than used for the previous injection .

Injectable suspension : 104 mg / 0 . 65 mL ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of depo - subQ provera 104 is contraindicated in the following conditions : • Active thrombophlebitis , or current or history of thromboembolic disorders , or cerebral vascular disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
• Known , suspected , or past malignancy of the breast [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
• Significant liver disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 13 ) ] .
• Known hypersensitivity to medroxyprogesterone acetate or any of the ingredients in depo - subQ provera 104 [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] .
• Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) ] .
• Active thrombophlebitis , or current or history of thromboembolic disorders , or cerebral vascular disease .
( 4 ) • Known , suspected , or past malignancy of the breast .
( 4 ) • Significant liver disease .
( 4 ) • Known hypersensitivity to medroxyprogesterone acetate or any of the ingredients of depo - subQ provera 104 .
( 4 ) • Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Thromboembolic disorders : Discontinue depo - subQ provera 104 in patients who develop arterial or venous thrombosis .
( 5 . 2 ) • Breast cancer risks : Monitor women with a family history of breast cancer or a significant risk of breast cancer carefully .
( 5 . 3 ) • Ectopic pregnancy : Consider ectopic pregnancy if a woman becomes pregnant or complains of severe abdominal pain .
( 5 . 4 ) • Anaphylaxis : Provide emergency medical treatment .
( 5 . 5 ) • Injection site reactions ( e . g . , persistent atrophy , dimpling / indentation , and lump / nodule ) have been reported .
( 5 . 10 ) • Diabetics may be at greater risk of hyperglycemia .
( 5 . 12 ) • Jaundice and elevated transaminase : Discontinue depo - subQ provera 104 if jaundice or elevated transaminase levels develop .
( 5 . 13 ) 5 . 1 Loss of Bone Mineral Density Use of depo - subQ provera 104 reduces serum estrogen levels and is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density ( BMD ) .
This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence and early adulthood , a critical period of bone accretion .
It is unknown if use of depo - subQ provera 104 by younger women will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life .
A study to assess the reversibility of loss of BMD in adolescents was conducted with DMPA - IM .
After discontinuing DMPA - IM in these adolescents , mean BMD loss at the total hip and femoral neck did not fully recover by 5 years ( 60 months ) post - treatment in the sub - group of adolescents who were treated for more than 2 years [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
Similarly , in adults , there was only partial recovery of mean BMD at the total hip , femoral neck , and lumbar spine towards baseline by 2 years post - treatment [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
The use of depo - subQ provera 104 is not recommended as a long - term ( i . e . , longer than 2 years ) birth control method or medical therapy for endometriosis - associated pain unless other options are considered inadequate .
BMD should be evaluated when a woman needs to continue to use depo - subQ provera 104 long - term .
In adolescents , interpretation of BMD results should take into account patient age and skeletal maturity .
Other birth control methods or therapies for endometriosis - associated pain should be considered in the risk / benefit analysis for the use of depo - subQ provera 104 in women with osteoporosis risk factors .
Depo - subQ provera 104 can pose an additional risk in patients with risk factors for osteoporosis ( e . g . , metabolic bone disease , chronic alcohol and / or tobacco use , anorexia nervosa , strong family history of osteoporosis , or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass such as anticonvulsants or corticosteroids ) .
5 . 2 Arterial and Venous Thromboembolic Disorders There have been reports of serious arterial and venous thrombotic events in women treated with DMPA - IM .
Women with a history of thromboembolic disorders were not studied in clinical trials of depo - subQ provera 104 .
Although no causal relationship between the use of depo - subQ provera 104 and thrombotic events has been clearly established , patients who develop arterial or venous thrombosis while taking depo - subQ provera 104 should discontinue treatment .
Do not re - administer depo - subQ provera 104 pending examination if there is a sudden onset of a suspected vascular ocular event ( e . g . , partial or complete loss of vision , proptosis , or diplopia ) or migraine .
Do not re - administer depo - subQ provera 104 if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions .
5 . 3 Cancer Risks Breast Cancer The use of hormonal contraceptives , including depo sub - Q provera 104 , is contraindicated in women who have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be sensitive to hormones [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Women who have a family history of breast cancer or a significant risk of breast cancer should be monitored .
The results of five large case - control studies assessing the association between DMPA - IM use and the risk of breast cancer are summarized in Figure M . Three of the studies suggest a slightly increased risk of breast cancer in the overall population of users ; these increased risks were statistically significant in one study .
One US study1 evaluated the timing and duration of use and found a statistically significant increased risk of breast cancer in recent DMPA - IM users ( defined as last use within the past five years ) who used DMPA - IM for 12 months or longer ; this is consistent with results of a previous study2 .
Figure M . Risk Estimates of Breast Cancer in DMPA - IM Users Odds ratio estimates were adjusted for the following covariates : Lee et al . ( 1987 ) : age , parity , and socioeconomic status .
Paul et al . ( 1989 ) : age , parity , ethnic group , and year of interview .
WHO ( 1991 ) : age , center , and age at first live birth .
Shapiro et al . ( 2000 ) : age , ethnic group , socioeconomic status , and any combined estrogen / progestogen oral contraceptive use .
Li et al . ( 2012 ) : age , year , BMI , duration of OC use , number of full - term pregnancies , family history of breast cancer , and history of screening mammography .
Odds Ratio [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) ] displayed on logarithmic scale [ MULTIMEDIA ] Based on the published SEER - 18 2015 incidence rate ( age - adjusted to the 2000 US Standard Population ) of breast cancer for US women , all races , age 20 to 49 years , a doubling of risk would increase the incidence of breast cancer in women who use DMPA - IM from about 73 to about 146 cases per 100 , 000 women .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Other Cancers The relative rate of invasive squamous - cell cervical cancer in women who ever used DMPA - IM was estimated to be 1 . 11 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 96 to 1 . 29 ) .
No trends in risk with duration of use or times since initial or most recent exposure were observed .
Long - term , case - controlled surveillance of users of DMPA - IM found no overall increased risk of ovarian or liver cancer .
5 . 4 Ectopic Pregnancy Healthcare professionals should be alert to the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy among women using depo - subQ provera 104 who become pregnant or complain of severe abdominal pain .
5 . 5 Anaphylaxis Serious anaphylactic reactions have been reported in women using depo - subQ provera 104 .
If an anaphylactic reaction occurs , appropriate emergency medical treatment should be administered .
5 . 6 Fluid Retention Because progestational drugs including depo - subQ provera 104 may cause fluid retention , monitor patients with conditions that might be affected by fluid retention .
5 . 7 Weight Gain Weight gain is a common occurrence in women using depo - subQ provera 104 .
In three large clinical trials using depo - subQ provera 104 , the mean weight gain was 3 . 5 lb ( 1 . 6 kg ) in the first year of use .
In a small , two - year study comparing depo - subQ provera 104 to DMPA - IM , the mean weight gain observed for women using depo - subQ provera 104 [ 7 . 5 lb ( 3 . 4 kg ) ] was similar to the mean weight gain for women using DMPA - IM [ 7 . 6 lb ( 3 . 5 kg ) ] .
Although there are no data related to weight gain beyond 2 years for depo - subQ provera 104 , the data on DMPA - IM may be relevant .
In a clinical study , after five years , 41 women using Depo - Provera CI ( 150 mg ) had a mean weight gain of 11 . 2 lb ( 5 . 1 kg ) , while 114 women using non - hormonal contraception had a mean weight gain of 6 . 4 lb ( 2 . 9 kg ) .
5 . 8 Delayed Return of Ovulation or Fertility Return to ovulation is likely to be delayed after stopping depo - subQ provera 104 , as demonstrated in a study of 15 women who received multiple doses of depo - subQ provera 104 : • Median time to ovulation was 10 months after the last injection .
• Earliest return to ovulation was 6 months after the last injection .
• 12 women ( 80 % ) ovulated within 1 year of the last injection .
However , ovulation has occurred as early as 14 weeks after a single dose of depo - subQ provera 104 ; therefore , administer the next depo - subQ provera 104 12 to 14 weeks after the last injection .
Return to fertility also is likely to be delayed after stopping therapy .
Among 28 women using depo - subQ provera 104 for contraception who stopped treatment to become pregnant , 7 women were lost to follow - up .
One woman became pregnant within one year of her last injection and another woman became pregnant 443 days after her last injection .
The remaining 19 women had not become pregnant ; it is not known if these 19 women were still attempting to become pregnant or if they had started a new contraceptive method .
5 . 9 Depression Depression ( 3 % of depo - subQ provera 104 - treated patients ) and other mood disorders have been reported in clinical trials of depo - subQ provera 104 [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Patients with a history of depression or who are on treatment for depression may be at increased risk for depression recurrence or exacerbation and for associated mood disorders while receiving depo - subQ provera 104 .
Therefore , patients should be monitored for symptoms of depression and mood changes .
5 . 10 Injection Site Reactions In five clinical studies of depo - subQ provera 104 involving 2325 women ( 282 treated for up to 6 months , 1780 treated for up to 1 year , and 263 women treated for up to 2 years ) , 5 % of women reported injection site reactions , and 1 % had persistent skin changes ( small areas of induration or atrophy ) .
In post - marketing experience , injection site reactions such as persistent atrophy of the injection site , dimpling / indentation , and injection site lump / nodule have been reported .
5 . 11 Bleeding Irregularities Most women using depo - subQ provera 104 experienced changes in menstrual bleeding patterns , such as amenorrhea , irregular unpredictable spotting or bleeding , prolonged spotting or bleeding , or heavy bleeding [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Fewer women experienced irregular bleeding and more experienced amenorrhea with longer term use of depo - subQ provera 104 , consistent with expected endometrial thinning effects .
In three contraception trials , 39 % of 2053 depo - subQ provera 104 - treated women experienced amenorrhea during Month 6 , and 57 % experienced amenorrhea during Month 12 .
In two endometriosis trials using depo - subQ provera 104 , 24 % of 289 women experienced amenorrhea during Month 6 [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
If abnormal bleeding is persistent or severe , evaluate the patient for underlying pathology or pregnancy .
5 . 12 Risk of Hyperglycemia in Patients with Diabetes Some patients receiving progestins may exhibit a decrease in glucose tolerance ; therefore , patients with diabetes may be at greater risk of hyperglycemia .
5 . 13 Jaundice and Elevated Transaminase Discontinue depo - subQ provera 104 if jaundice or elevated transaminase levels develop .
Depo - subQ provera 104 may be resumed after both the jaundice and elevated transaminase levels resolve , and the healthcare professional determines that depo - subQ provera 104 did not cause the abnormalities .
5 . 14 Protection Against Sexually Transmitted Infections Patients should be counseled that this product does not protect against HIV infection ( including AIDS ) and other sexually transmitted infections .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following important adverse reactions are described in more detail in other sections of the prescribing information : • Loss of bone mineral density [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Arterial and venous thromboembolic disorders [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Anaphylaxis [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Fluid retention [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] • Delayed return of ovulation or fertility [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] • Depression [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] • Injection site reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 10 ) ] • Bleeding irregularities [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 11 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( incidence > 5 % ) are dysfunctional uterine bleeding , headache , increased weight , amenorrhea , and injection site reactions .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The data described below reflect exposure to depo - subQ provera 104 in five clinical trials involving 2325 women including 2043 women who received treatment for contraception ( 1780 treated up to 1 year and 263 treated for up to 2 years ) and 282 women for endometriosis for up to 6 months .
In these pooled trials , 9 % of women discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction and the most common reason for discontinuation was dysfunctional uterine bleeding ( 3 % ) .
Adverse Reactions in the Contraception Adult Studies Table 1 presents frequently reported adverse reactions ( > 1 % ) in the contraception pooled studies .
In these studies , the most frequently reported adverse reactions ( > 5 % ) were dysfunctional uterine bleeding ( e . g . , irregular , increased , decreased , or spotting ) , headache , increased weight , amenorrhea , and injection site reactions ( e . g . , pain / tenderness , nodule / lump , persistent atrophy / indentation / dimpling or lipodystrophy ) .
The frequency reported is based on the all - causality incidence in the pooled results of the three contraception studies .
Closely related " Adverse Reaction " terms were grouped but individual patients reporting two or more grouped events were only counted once .
Table 1 .
Frequently Reported Adverse Reactions in the Contraception Studies ( > 1 % ) Adverse Reaction Frequency Dysfunctional uterine bleeding ( irregular , increase , decrease , spotting ) 18 % Headache 9 % Increased weight ( see below ) 7 % Amenorrhea 6 % Injection site reactions ( such as pain / tenderness , nodule / lump , persistent atrophy / indentation / dimpling , lipodystrophy ) 6 % Vaginitis , including candidiasis and bacterial 5 % Abdominal pain 4 % Urinary tract infections 4 % Acne 4 % Depression 3 % Decreased libido 3 % Nausea 3 % Back pain 3 % Breast pain / tenderness 2 % Fatigue 2 % Anxiety 1 % Irritability 1 % Dizziness 1 % Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding The extent of bleeding and spotting in the three contraception trials is presented in Figure N ; data from the endometriosis trials are presented in Figure O [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure O . Mean Number of Bleeding or Spotting Days in the Subgroup of Women with Bleeding or Spotting Among Women Treated with depo - subQ provera 104 in Endometriosis StudiesN = Number of subjects with bleeding or spotting during indicated month .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Weight Gain In three large clinical trials , the mean weight gain in depo - subQ provera 104 treated patients was 3 . 5 lb ( 1 . 6 kg ) in the first year of use .
Half ( 50 % ) of women remained within 4 . 9 lb ( 2 . 2 kg ) of their initial body weight ; 12 % of women lost more than 4 . 9 lb ( 2 . 2 kg ) , and 38 % of women gained more than 5 . 1 lb ( 2 . 3 kg ) .
In a small , 2 - year study comparing depo - subQ provera 104 to DMPA - IM , the mean weight gain observed for women using depo - subQ provera 104 [ 7 . 5 lb ( 3 . 4 kg ) ] was similar to the mean weight gain for women using DMPA - IM [ 7 . 7 lb ( 3 . 5 kg ) ] .
Other Adverse Reactions Observed in Contraception Clinical Trials with depo - subQ provera 104 Other adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of < 1 % in women who received depo - subQ provera 104 were as follows : • Neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified ( including cysts and polyps ) : breast lump • Blood and lymphatic system disorders : anemia • Immune system disorders : drug hypersensitivity • Metabolism and nutrition disorders : weight decreased , fluid retention • Nervous system disorders : facial palsy , syncope , paresthesia , somnolence • Cardiac disorders : tachycardia • Vascular disorders : hot flushes • Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders : asthma , dyspnea • Gastrointestinal disorders : diarrhea , abdominal distension • Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : urticaria , pruritus , dry skin • Reproductive system and breast disorders : dysmenorrhea , galactorrhea , dyspareunia • General disorders and administration site conditions : chest pain Adverse Reactions in the Endometriosis Adult Studies The safety profile of depo - subQ provera 104 in endometriosis clinical trials was similar to the safety profile of depo - subQ provera 104 in the contraception studies with the exception of the following adverse reactions which were more frequently reported in patients with endometriosis : abdominal pain , diarrhea , nausea , and back pain .
In endometriosis studies , subjects recorded daily the occurrence and severity of hot flushes .
Of the depo - subQ provera 104 users , 29 % reported experiencing moderate or severe hot flushes at baseline , 36 % at Month 3 , and 27 % at Month 6 .
Of the leuprolide users , 33 % reported experiencing moderate or severe hot flushes at baseline , 74 % at Month 3 , and 69 % at Month 6 .
Adverse Reactions in the Adolescent Contraception Study Depo - sub - Q provera 104 and DMPA - IM clinical trials reported similar safety profiles in adult study populations ( see Table 1 above ) .
Accordingly , a similar safety profile is expected for adolescents receiving depo - subQ provera 104 as for adolescents receiving DMPA - IM .
The safety profile of DMPA - IM for prevention of pregnancy in adolescents was observed to be generally similar to the safety profile of adult women using DMPA - IM for prevention of pregnancy , with the exception of the following adverse reactions which were reported more frequently by adolescents : abdominal pain , diarrhea , back pain , weight increased , depression , headache , and dysmenorrhea .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of DMPA - IM .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure : • Immune system disorders : anaphylactic reaction , anaphylactoid reaction , angioedema • Vascular disorders : pulmonary embolism , deep vein thrombosis , thrombophlebitis • Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders : osteoporosis ( including osteoporotic fractures ) • Reproductive system and breast disorders : prolonged anovulation , unexpected pregnancy , uterine hyperplasia • Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders : hoarseness • Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : increased body odor • Gastrointestinal disorders : gastrointestinal disturbances • General disorders and administration site conditions : axillary swelling , chills , thirst 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers : Avoid concomitant use .
( 7 ) 7 . 1 Effect of Other Drugs on Depo - subQ provera 104 Moderate or Strong CYP3A Inducers Concomitant use with moderate or strong CYP3A inducers may decrease concentrations of medroxyprogesterone acetate which may reduce depo - subQ provera 104 efficacy .
This effect is based upon the primary metabolism of medroxyprogesterone acetate by CYP3A and was not confirmed by a clinical study .
Avoid coadministration of depo - subQ provera 104 with moderate or strong CYP3A inducers .
Some examples of moderate CYP3A inducers are bosentan , efavirenz , etravirine , and modafinil .
Some examples of strong CYP3A inducers are rifampin , carbamazepine , phenytoin , phenobarbital , mitotane , and St . John ' s wort ( the CYP3A4 induction effect of St . John ' s wort varies widely and is preparation dependent ) .
These examples are a guide and do not represent a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may fit these categories .
The use of CYP3A inducers may require using a back - up or alternate contraceptive method .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Nursing mothers : Detectable amounts of drug have been identified in the milk of mothers receiving depot - medroxyprogesterone acetate .
( 8 . 3 ) • Pediatric patients ( after menarche ) : Bone loss is a particular concern .
( 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy There is no use for depo - subQ provera 104 in pregnancy and therefore depo - subQ provera 104 should be discontinued during pregnancy .
There appears to be little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who have inadvertently been exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate injections in early pregnancy .
Neonates exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate in - utero and followed to adolescence showed no evidence of any adverse effects on their health including their physical , intellectual , sexual , or social development .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Although medroxyprogesterone acetate is detectable in the milk of mothers receiving DMPA - IM , milk composition , quality , and amount do not appear to be adversely affected .
Effects on milk production and lactation initiation / duration remain unclear when administered before 6 weeks after delivery .
Neonates and infants exposed to medroxyprogesterone acetate from breast milk have been studied for developmental and behavioral effects through puberty , and no adverse effects have been noted .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Depo - subQ provera 104 is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy and management of endometriosis - associated pain in females of reproductive age .
Efficacy is expected to be the same for post - menarchal females under the age of 17 as for users 17 years and older .
Use of depo - subQ provera 104 is associated with significant loss of bone mineral density ( BMD ) .
This loss of BMD is of particular concern during adolescence , a critical period of bone accretion .
It is unknown if use of depo - subQ provera 104 by female adolescents will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fractures in later life .
In a study of adolescent females ( 12 – 18 years of age ) receiving DMPA - IM for contraception , mean BMD 2 years after starting DMPA - IM decreased 1 . 9 % ( spine ) , 4 . 3 % ( total hip ) , and 4 . 2 % ( femoral neck ) .
In those adolescents who used DMPA - IM for more than 2 years , mean BMD at total hip and femoral neck did not return to baseline within 5 years .
Depo - subQ provera 104 is not indicated before menarche .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Depo - subQ provera 104 is not indicated in post - menopausal women .
11 DESCRIPTION Depo - subQ provera 104 contains medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA ) , a derivative of progesterone , as its active ingredient .
MPA is a white to off - white , odorless crystalline powder that is stable in air and that melts between 205 ° C and 209 ° C .
It is freely soluble in chloroform , soluble in acetone and dioxane , sparingly soluble in alcohol and methanol , slightly soluble in ether , and insoluble in water .
The chemical name for MPA is 17 - hydroxy - 6α - methylpregn - 4 - ene - 3 , 20 - dione 17 - acetate .
The structural formula is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Depo - subQ provera 104 for subcutaneous use is available in pre - filled syringes , each containing 0 . 65 mL ( 104 mg ) of sterile medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension .
Each 0 . 65 mL contains the following inactive ingredients : Methylparaben 1 . 040 mg Propylparaben 0 . 098 mg Sodium Chloride 5 . 200 mg Polyethylene Glycol 18 . 688 mg Polysorbate 80 1 . 950 mg Monobasic Sodium Phosphate H2O 0 . 451 mg Dibasic Sodium Phosphate 12H2O 0 . 382 mg Methionine 0 . 975 mg Povidone 3 . 250 mg Water for Injection qs When necessary , the pH is adjusted with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid , or both .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Depo - subQ provera 104 inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins , which primarily prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and causes thickening of cervical mucus .
These actions contribute to its contraceptive effect .
Suppression of serum estradiol concentrations is likely to be responsible for the therapeutic effect on endometriosis - associated pain .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The following laboratory tests are expected to be affected by progestins including depo - subQ provera 104 : • Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased ( e . g . , progesterone , estradiol , pregnanediol , testosterone , cortisol ) .
• Gonadotropin levels are decreased .
• Sex - hormone - binding - globulin concentrations are decreased .
• Histology specimens may demonstrate changes consistent with progestin effects .
The following laboratory tests may be affected by depo - subQ provera 104 , however the clinical significance is unknown : • Protein - bound iodine and butanol extractable protein - bound iodine may increase .
• T3 - uptake values may decrease .
• Coagulation test values for prothrombin ( Factor II ) , and Factors VII , VIII , IX , and X may increase .
• Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased .
• The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on lipid metabolism are inconsistent .
Both increases and decreases in total cholesterol , triglycerides , low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol , and high - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol have been observed in studies .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA following a single subcutaneous injection of depo - subQ provera 104 in healthy women ( n = 42 ) are shown in Table 2 and Figure P . Table 2 .
Pharmacokinetic Parameters of MPA after a Single Subcutaneous Injection of depo - subQ provera 104 in Healthy Women Cmax ( ng / mL ) Tmax ( day ) C91 ( ng / mL ) AUC0 – 91 ( ng ∙ day / mL ) AUC0 –∞ ( ng ∙ day / mL ) t ½ ( day ) Abbreviations : Cmax = peak serum concentration ; Tmax = time when Cmax is observed ; C91 = serum concentration at 91 days ; AUC0 – 91 and AUC0 –∞ = area under the concentration - time curve over 91 days or infinity , respectively ; t ½ = terminal half - life .
Mean 1 . 56 8 . 8 0 . 402 66 . 98 92 . 84 43 Min 0 . 53 2 . 0 0 . 133 20 . 63 31 . 36 16 Max 3 . 08 80 . 0 0 . 733 139 . 79 162 . 29 114 Following subcutaneous administration of single depo - subQ provera 104 doses ranging from 50 to 150 mg ( 0 . 48 and 1 . 4 times the recommended dose , respectively ) , the AUC and Cmin ( Day 91 ) increased with higher doses , but there was considerable overlap across dose levels .
Serum MPA concentrations at Day 91 increased in a dose proportional manner but Cmax did not appear to increase proportionally with increasing dose .
The AUC data were suggestive of dose linearity .
Absorption Following a single subcutaneous injection of depo - subQ provera 104 in healthy women , serum MPA concentrations reached ≥ 0 . 2 ng / mL within 24 hours .
The mean Tmax was attained approximately 1 week after injection .
Figure P . Serum Concentration - Time Profile of MPA Mean ( SD ) after a Single Injection of depo - subQ provera 104 to Healthy Women [ MULTIMEDIA ] In a study to assess accumulation and the achievement of steady state following multiple subcutaneous administrations , trough concentrations of MPA were determined after 6 , 12 , and 24 months , and in a subset of 8 subjects , bi - weekly concentrations were determined within one dosing interval in the second year of administration .
The mean ( SD ) MPA trough concentrations were 0 . 67 ( 0 . 36 ) ng / mL ( n = 157 ) , 0 . 79 ( 0 . 36 ) ng / mL ( n = 144 ) , and 0 . 87 ( 0 . 33 ) ng / mL ( n = 106 ) at 6 , 12 , and 24 months , respectively .
Depo - subQ provera 104 was administered subcutaneously into the anterior thigh or the abdomen to evaluate effects of injection site location on the MPA concentration - time profile .
MPA trough concentrations ( Cmin ; Day 91 ) were similar for the two injection site locations .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Distribution Plasma protein binding of MPA averages 86 % .
MPA binding occurs primarily to serum albumin .
No binding of MPA occurs with sex - hormone - binding globulin ( SHBG ) .
Elimination Metabolism MPA is extensively metabolized in the liver by P450 enzymes .
Its metabolism primarily involves ring A and / or side - chain reduction , loss of the acetyl group , hydroxylation in the 2 - , 6 - , and 21 - positions or a combination of these positions , resulting in more than 10 metabolites .
Excretion Residual MPA concentrations at the end of the first dosing interval ( 12 to 14 weeks ) of depo - subQ provera 104 were generally below 0 . 5 ng / mL , consistent with its apparent terminal half - life of ~ 40 days after subcutaneous administration .
Most MPA metabolites were excreted in the urine as glucuronide conjugates with only small amounts excreted as sulfates .
Specific Populations Racial Groups There were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics and / or pharmacodynamics of MPA after subcutaneous administration of depo - subQ provera 104 in African - American , Caucasian , and Asian women .
Effect of Body Weight Although total MPA exposure was lower in obese women , no dosage adjustment of depo - subQ provera 104 is necessary based on body weight .
The effect of body weight on the pharmacokinetics of MPA following a single dose was assessed in a subset of women [ n = 42 , body mass index ( BMI ) ranged from 18 . 2 to 46 . 7 kg / m2 ] .
The AUC0 – 91 values for MPA were 71 . 6 , 67 . 9 , and 46 . 3 ng ∙ day / mL in women with BMI categories of ≤ 28 kg / m2 , > 28 – 38 kg / m2 , and > 38 kg / m2 , respectively .
The mean MPA Cmax was 1 . 74 ng / mL in women with BMI ≤ 28 kg / m2 , 1 . 53 ng / mL in women with BMI > 28 – 38 kg / m2 , and 1 . 02 ng / mL in women with BMI > 38 kg / m2 , respectively .
The MPA trough ( Cmin ) concentrations had a tendency to be lower in women with BMI > 38 kg / m2 .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 , 5 . 8 ] ) 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Contraception Studies In three open label clinical studies , depo - SubQ provera 104 ( 104 mg given every three months subcutaneously ) , was administered to healthy , sexually - active , nonpregnant women 18 to 49 years of age who desired long - term contraception .
In these three studies , no pregnancies were detected among 2042 women treated with depo - subQ provera 104 for up to 1 year .
In women less than 36 years of age ( at baseline ) , the Pearl Index pregnancy rate in cycles in which no other contraceptive methods were used , was 0 pregnancies per 100 women - years of use ( upper 95 % CI = 0 . 25 ) .
14 . 2 Endometriosis Studies The efficacy of depo - subQ provera 104 in the reduction of endometriosis - associated pain in women with the signs and symptoms of endometriosis was demonstrated in two active comparator - controlled studies in pre - menopausal women 18 to 49 years of age with laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis and persistent endometriosis pain symptoms ( i . e . , Studies 268 and 270 ) .
Each study assessed endometriosis - associated pain over 6 months of treatment and recurrence of symptoms for 12 - months post treatment .
Subjects were treated for six months with depo - subQ provera 104 [ 104 mg given subcutaneously every 3 months ( 2 injections ) ] or leuprolide [ 11 . 25 mg given subcutaneously every 3 months ( 2 injections ) or 3 . 75 mg given subcutaneously every month ( 6 injections ) ] .
Study 268 was conducted in the U . S . and Canada and enrolled 274 subjects ( 136 subjects received depo - subQ provera 104 and 138 subjects received leuprolide ) .
Study 270 was conducted in South America , Europe , and Asia , and enrolled 299 subjects ( 153 subjects received depo - subQ provera 104 and 146 subjects received leuprolide ) .
Reduction in endometriosis pain was evaluated using a modified Biberoglu and Behrman scale that consisted of three patient - reported symptoms ( i . e . , dysmenorrhea , dyspareunia , and pelvic pain not related to menses ) and two signs assessed during pelvic examination ( i . e . , pelvic tenderness and induration ) .
For each category , a favorable response was defined as improvement of at least 1 unit ( severity was assessed on a scale of 0 to 3 ) relative to baseline score ( Figure Q ) .
Figure Q . Responders at End of Treatment ( Month 6 or Last Assessment if Earlier ) in Patients with Endometriosis in Studies 268 and 270 Favorable Response = reduction in severity of symptom or sign of ≥ 1 point on a scale of 0 to 3 , as compared to baseline .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Additionally , scores from each of the five categories were combined into a composite score that was considered a global measurement of overall disease improvement .
For subjects with baseline scores for each of the 5 categories , a mean decrease of 4 points relative to baseline was considered a clinically meaningful improvement .
Across both studies , the mean changes in the composite score met the protocol - defined criterion for improvement for the depo - subQ provera 104 and leuprolide treatment groups .
In the clinical trials , treatment with depo - subQ provera 104 was limited to six months .
Data on the persistence of benefit with longer treatment are not available .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 3 Bone Mineral Density in Women Treated with Depo - medroxyprogesterone acetate for Contraception In a study that compared changes in bone mineral density ( BMD ) in adult women using depo - subQ provera 104 or DMPA - IM for contraception , both treatments showed BMD reductions in the lumbar spine , total hip , and femoral neck .
Mean percent changes in BMD in depo - subQ provera 104 - treated women are shown in Table 3 .
Table 3 .
BMD Mean Percent Change from Baseline in Women Using depo - subQ provera 104 for ContraceptionTime on Treatment Lumbar Spine Total Hip Femoral Neck Mean % Change ( 95 % CI ) Mean % Change ( 95 % CI ) Mean % Change ( 95 % CI ) 1 year ( n = 166 ) - 2 . 7 ( - 3 . 1 to - 2 . 3 ) - 1 . 7 ( - 2 . 1 to - 1 . 3 ) - 1 . 9 ( - 2 . 5 to - 1 . 4 ) 2 years ( n = 106 ) - 4 . 1 ( - 4 . 6 to - 3 . 5 ) - 3 . 5 ( - 4 . 2 to - 2 . 7 ) - 3 . 5 ( - 4 . 3 to - 2 . 6 ) BMD Recovery Post - Treatment in Women Given the similar effects on BMD from depo - subQ provera 104 and DMPA - IM described above , BMD recovery post - treatment is also expected to be similar .
In a controlled clinical study that compared changes in BMD in adult women using DMPA - IM for contraception or no hormonal contraception , the 2 - year post - treatment follow - up demonstrated incomplete recovery of BMD following the last injection of DMPA - IM .
Table 4 shows the change in BMD in women after 5 years of treatment with DMPA - IM and in the control group , as well as the extent of BMD recovery in the subset of women for whom 2 - year post - treatment data were available .

14 . 4 Bone Mineral Density Changes in Adolescent Females ( 12 to 18 years of age ) Treated with DMPA - IM The effect of DMPA - IM on BMD in adolescents is described below , and the effect of depo - subQ provera 104 on BMD in adolescents is expected to be similar .
The impact of DMPA - IM use for up to 240 weeks ( 4 . 6 years ) was evaluated in an open - label non - randomized clinical study in 389 adolescent females ( 12 to 18 years of age ) .
Use of DMPA - IM was associated with a significant decline from baseline in BMD .
Partway through the trial , DMPA - IM administration was stopped ( at 120 weeks ) .
The mean number of injections per DMPA - IM user was 9 . 3 .
Table 5 summarizes the study findings .
The decline in BMD at total hip and femoral neck was greater with longer duration of use .
The mean decrease in BMD at 240 weeks was more pronounced at total hip ( - 6 . 4 % ) and femoral neck ( - 5 . 4 % ) compared to lumbar spine ( - 2 . 1 % ) .
Adolescents in the untreated cohort had an increase in BMD during the period of growth following menarche .
However , the two cohorts were not matched at baseline for age , gynecologic age , race , BMD , and other factors that influence the rate of acquisition of BMD .
Table 5 .

Table 6 shows the extent of recovery of BMD up to 60 months post - treatment for adolescents who received DMPA - IM for two years or less compared to more than two years .
Post - treatment follow - up showed that , in adolescents treated for more than two years , only lumbar spine BMD recovered to baseline levels after treatment was discontinued .
Adolescents treated with DMPA - IM for more than two years did not recover to their baseline BMD level at the femoral neck and total hip even up to 60 months post - treatment .
Adolescents in the untreated cohort gained BMD throughout the trial period [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .

The incidence rates of fracture were compared between DMPA - IM users and contraceptive users who had no recorded use of DMPA - IM .
The Incident Rate Ratio ( IRR ) for any fracture during the follow - up period ( mean = 5 . 5 years ) was 1 . 41 ( 95 % CI 1 . 35 , 1 . 47 ) .
It is not known if this is due to DMPA - IM use or to other related lifestyle factors that have a bearing on fracture rate .
In the study , when cumulative exposure to DMPA - IM was calculated , the fracture rate in users who received fewer than 8 injections was higher than that in women who received 8 or more injections .
However , it is not clear that cumulative exposure , which may include periods of intermittent use separated by periods of non - use , is a useful measure of risk , as compared to exposure measures based on continuous use .
There were very few osteoporotic fractures ( fracture sites known to be related to low BMD ) in the study overall , and the incidence of osteoporotic fractures was not found to be higher in DMPA - IM users compared to non - users .
Importantly , this study could not determine whether use of DMPA - IM has an effect on fracture rate later in life .
Given the similar effects on BMD from depo - subQ provera 104 and DMPA - IM described above , bone fracture incidence may also be expected to be similar .
14 . 6 Bone Mineral Density in Women Treated with Depo - subQ provera 104 for Endometriosis In two clinical studies of 573 adult women with endometriosis , the BMD effects of 6 months of depo - subQ provera 104 treatment ( 104 mg subcutaneously every 3 months ) were compared to 6 months of leuprolide treatment ( either 11 . 25 mg given subcutaneously every 3 months or 3 . 75 mg given subcutaneously every month ) .
Subjects were then observed after treatment completion , for an additional 12 months .
See Table 7 for the results .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] LAB - 0295 - 16 . 0 [ MULTIMEDIA ] PATIENT INFORMATION DEPO - SUBQ PROVERA 104 ® ( deh - poh ' sub - cue ' pro - ver - ah ' one - oh - four ) ( medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension ) for subcutaneous use WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT depo - subQ provera 104 ?
Use of depo - subQ provera 104 may cause you to lose calcium stored in your bones .
The longer you use depo - subQ provera 104 the more calcium you are likely to lose .
The calcium may not return completely once you stop using depo - subQ provera 104 .
Loss of calcium may cause weak , porous bones ( osteoporosis ) that could increase the risk that your bones might break , especially after menopause .
It is not known whether your risk of developing osteoporosis may be greater if you are a teenager when you start to use depo - subQ provera 104 .
You should use depo - subQ provera 104 long - term ( for example , more than 2 years ) only if other methods of birth control or other treatments for endometriosis pain are not right for you .
Depo - subQ provera 104 does not protect you from HIV ( AIDS ) and other infections spread through sex ( STIs ) .
WHAT IS depo - subQ provera 104 ?
Depo - subQ provera 104 is a drug for birth control .
It also helps relieve pain related to endometriosis ( en - do - ME - tree - OH - sis ) .
Symptoms of endometriosis arise when cells normally inside your uterus grow outside the uterus .
The cells respond to menstrual cycle hormones , and may cause painful periods , pelvic pain , and painful sex .
Depo - subQ provera 104 contains a hormone called medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA ) .
It is given as a shot ( injection ) every 3 months .
Three months is the same as 12 to 14 weeks .
HOW WELL DOES depo - subQ provera 104 WORK FOR PREVENTING PREGNANCY ?
When you use depo - subQ provera 104 correctly , the chance of getting pregnant is very low .
In studies , no women became pregnant during the year they used depo - subQ provera 104 injection .
The list below estimates the chances of getting pregnant using different types of birth control .
The numbers are based on typical use .
Typical use includes people who use the method correctly and people who use the method incorrectly .
The list shows the number of women out of 100 women who will likely get pregnant if they use the method for 1 year .

Depo - subQ provera 104 is given as a shot just under the skin on your thigh or belly .
You get it once every 3 months .
For Birth Control First shot : Your healthcare professional will want to be sure that you are not pregnant before you get your first shot .
Normally , you get the shot by the 5 th day from the START of your menstrual period .
You get it whether or not you are still bleeding .
If you are breast - feeding , you may have your first shot as early as 6 weeks after you deliver your baby .
After the first shot : It is very important to keep getting depo - subQ provera 104 every 3 months .
If you wait more than 14 weeks between shots , you could become pregnant .
Your healthcare professional must make sure you are not pregnant before you get your next shot .
When you get your shot , make an appointment for your next shot .
Mark it on your calendar .
