For use on fingernails and toenails and immediatelyadjacent skin only Not for use in eyes DESCRIPTION Ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , contains a synthetic antifungal agent , ciclopirox .
It is intended for topical use on fingernails and toenails and immediately adjacent skin .
Each gram of ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , contains 80 mg ciclopirox in a solution base consisting of butyl monoester of poly [ methylvinyl ether / maleic acid ] , ethyl acetate , and isopropyl alcohol .
Ethyl acetate and isopropyl alcohol are solvents that vaporize after application .
Ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , is a clear , colorless to light yellow solution .
The chemical name for ciclopirox is 6 - cyclohexyl - 1 - hydroxy - 4 - methyl - 2 ( 1 H ) - pyridone .
The CAS Registry Number is [ 29342 - 05 - 0 ] .
The chemical structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] C12H17NO2 M . W . 207 . 27 [ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY MicrobiologyMechanism of Action The mechanism of action of ciclopirox has been investigated using various in vitro and in vivo infection models .
One in vitro study suggested that ciclopirox acts by chelation of polyvalent cations ( Fe + 3 or Al + 3 ) resulting in the inhibition of the metal - dependent enzymes that are responsible for the degradation of peroxides within the fungal cell .
The clinical significance of this observation is not known .
Activity In Vitro and Ex VivoIn vitro methodologies employing various broth or solid media with and without additional nutrients have been utilized to determine ciclopirox minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) values for the dermatophytic molds . 1 - 2 As a consequence , a broad range of MIC values , 1 to 20 mcg / mL , were obtained for Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes species .
Correlation between in vitro MIC results and clinical outcome has yet to be established for ciclopirox .
One ex vivo study was conducted evaluating 8 % ciclopirox against new and established Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes infections in ovine hoof material . 3 After 10 days of treatment the growth of T . rubrum and T . mentagrophytes in the established infection model was very minimally affected .
Elimination of the molds from hoof material was not achieved in either the new or established infection models .
Susceptibility Testing for Trichophyton rubrum SpeciesIn vitro susceptibility testing methods for determining ciclopirox MIC values against the dermatophytic molds , including Trichophyton rubrum species , have not been standardized or validated .
Ciclopirox MIC values will vary depending on the susceptibility testing method employed , composition and pH of media and the utilization of nutritional supplements .
Breakpoints to determine whether clinical isolates of Trichophyton rubrum are susceptible or resistant to ciclopirox have not been established .
ResistanceStudies have not been conducted to evaluate drug resistance development in T . rubrum species exposed to 8 % ciclopirox topical solution .
Studies assessing cross - resistance to ciclopirox and other known antifungal agents have not been performed .
Antifungal Drug InteractionsNo studies have been conducted to determine whether ciclopirox might reduce the effectiveness of systemic antifungal agents for onychomycosis .
Therefore , the concomitant use of 8 % ciclopirox topical solution and systemic antifungal agents for onychomycosis is not recommended .
PharmacokineticsAs demonstrated in pharmacokinetic studies in animals and man , ciclopirox olamine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and completely eliminated in all species via feces and urine .
Most of the compound is excreted either unchanged or as glucuronide .
After oral administration of 10 mg of radiolabeled drug ( 14 C - ciclopirox ) to healthy volunteers , approximately 96 % of the radioactivity was excreted renally within 12 hours of administration .
Ninety - four percent of the renally excreted radioactivity was in the form of glucuronides .
Thus , glucuronidation is the main metabolic pathway of this compound .
Systemic absorption of ciclopirox was determined in 5 patients with dermatophytic onychomycoses , after application of ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , to all 20 digits and adjacent 5 mm of skin once daily for six months .
Random serum concentrations and 24 hour urinary excretion of ciclopirox were determined at two weeks and at 1 , 2 , 4 and 6 months after initiation of treatment and 4 weeks post - treatment .
In this study , ciclopirox serum levels ranged from 12 to 80 ng / mL .
Based on urinary data , mean absorption of ciclopirox from the dosage form was less than 5 % of the applied dose .
One month after cessation of treatment , serum and urine levels of ciclopirox were below the limit of detection .
In two vehicle - controlled trials , patients applied ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , to all toenails and affected fingernails .
Out of a total of 66 randomly selected patients on active treatment , 24 had detectable serum ciclopirox concentrations at some point during the dosing interval ( range 10 . 0 to 24 . 6 ng / mL ) .
It should be noted that eleven of these 24 patients took concomitant medication containing ciclopirox as ciclopirox olamine cream , 0 . 77 % .
The penetration of the ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , was evaluated in an in vitro investigation .
Radiolabeled ciclopirox applied once to onychomycotic toenails that were avulsed demonstrated penetration up to a depth of approximately 0 . 4 mm .
As expected , nail plate concentrations decreased as a function of nail depth .
The clinical significance of these findings in nail plates is unknown .
Nail bed concentrations were not determined .

Ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , as a component of a comprehensive management program , is indicated as topical treatment in immunocompetent patients with mild to moderate onychomycosis of fingernails and toenails without lunula involvement , due to Trichophytonrubrum .
The comprehensive management program includes removal of the unattached , infected nails as frequently as monthly , by a health care professional who has special competence in the diagnosis and treatment of nail disorders , including minor nail procedures .
• No studies have been conducted to determine whether ciclopirox might reduce the effectiveness of systemic antifungal agents for onychomycosis .
Therefore , the concomitant use of 8 % ciclopirox topical solution and systemic antifungal agents for onychomycosis , is not recommended .
• Ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , should be used only under medical supervision as described above .
• The effectiveness and safety of ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , in the following populations has not been studied .
The clinical trials with use of ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , excluded patients who : were pregnant or nursing , planned to become pregnant , had a history of immunosuppression ( e . g . , extensive , persistent , or unusual distribution of dermatomycoses , extensive seborrheic dermatitis , recent or recurring herpes zoster , or persistent herpes simplex ) , were HIV seropositive , received organ transplant , required medication to control epilepsy , were insulin dependent diabetics or had diabetic neuropathy .
Patients with severe plantar ( moccasin ) tinea pedis were also excluded .
• The safety and efficacy of using ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , daily for greater than 48 weeks have not been established .
Clinical Trials DataThe results of use of ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , in treatment of onychomycosis of the toenail without lunula involvement were obtained from two double - blind , placebo - controlled studies conducted in the US .
In these studies , patients with onychomycosis of the great toenails without lunula involvement were treated with ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) in conjunction with monthly removal of the unattached , infected toenail by the investigator .
Ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , was applied for 48 weeks .
At baseline , patients had 20 to 65 % involvement of the target great toenail plate .
Statistical significance was demonstrated in one of two studies for the endpoint “ complete cure ” ( clear nail and negative mycology ) , and in two studies for the endpoint “ almost clear ” ( ≤ 10 % nail involvement and negative mycology ) at the end of study .

Ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , is for external use only .
• Ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , should be applied evenly over the entire nail plate and 5 mm of surrounding skin .
If possible , ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , should be applied to the nail bed , hyponychium , and the under surface of the nail plate when it is free of the nail bed ( e . g . , onycholysis ) .
Contact with the surrounding skin may produce mild , transient irritation ( redness ) .
• Removal of the unattached , infected nail , as frequently as monthly , by a health care professional is needed with use of this medication .
Inform a health care professional if they have diabetes or problems with numbness in your toes or fingers for consideration of the appropriate nail management program .
• Inform a health care professional if the area of application shows signs of increased irritation ( redness , itching , burning , blistering , swelling , oozing ) .
• Up to 48 weeks of daily applications with ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , and professional removal of the unattached , infected nail , as frequently as monthly , are considered the full treatment needed to achieve a clear or almost clear nail ( defined as 10 % or less residual nail involvement ) .
• Six months of therapy with professional removal of the unattached , infected nail may be required before initial improvement of symptoms is noticed .
• A completely clear nail may not be achieved with use of this medication .
In clinical studies less than 12 % of patients were able to achieve either a completely clear or almost clear toenail .
• Do not use the medication for any disorder other than that for which it is prescribed .
• Do not use nail polish or other nail cosmetic products on the treated nails .
• Avoid use near heat or open flame , because product is flammable .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of FertilityNo carcinogenicity study was conducted with ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , formulation .
A carcinogenicity study of ciclopirox ( 1 % and 5 % solutions in polyethylene glycol 400 ) in female mice dosed topically twice per week for 50 weeks followed by a 6 month drug - free observation period prior to necropsy revealed no evidence of tumors at the application sites .
In human systemic tolerability studies following daily application ( ~ 340 mg of ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) ) in subjects with distal subungual onychomycosis , the average maximal serum level of ciclopirox was 31 ± 28 ng / mL after two months of once daily applications .
This level was 159 times lower than the lowest toxic dose and 115 times lower than the highest nontoxic dose in rats and dogs fed 7 . 7 and 23 . 1 mg ciclopirox ( as ciclopirox olamine ) / kg / day .
The following in vitro genotoxicity tests have been conducted with ciclopirox : evaluation of gene mutation in Ames Salmonella and E . coli assays ( negative ) ; chromosome aberration assays in V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts , with and without metabolic activation ( positive ) ; gene mutation assay in the HGPRT - test with V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts ( negative ) ; unscheduled DNA synthesis in human A549 cells ( negative ) ; and BALB / c3T3 cell transformation assay ( negative ) .
In an in vivo Chinese hamster bone marrow cytogenetic assay , ciclopirox was negative for chromosome aberrations at 5 , 000 mg / kg .
The following in vitro genotoxicity tests were conducted with ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) : Ames Salmonella test ( negative ) ; unscheduled DNA synthesis in the rat hepatocytes ( negative ) ; cell transformation assay in BALB / c3T3 cell assay ( positive ) .
The positive response of the lacquer formulation in the BALB / c3T3 test was attributed to its butyl monoester of poly [ methylvinyl ether / maleic acid ] resin component ( Gantrez ® ES - 435 ) , which also tested positive in this test .
The cell transformation assay may have been confounded because of the film - forming nature of the resin .
Gantrez ® ES - 435 tested nonmutagenic in both the in vitro mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay with or without activation and unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in rat hepatocytes .
Oral reproduction studies in rats at doses up to 3 . 85 mg ciclopirox ( as ciclopirox olamine ) / kg / day [ equivalent to approximately 1 . 4 times the potential exposure at the maximum recommended human topical dose ( MRHTD ) ] did not reveal any specific effects on fertility or other reproductive parameters .
MRHTD ( mg / m2 ) is based on the assumption of 100 % systemic absorption of 27 . 12 mg ciclopirox ( ~ 340 mg ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) ) that will cover all the fingernails and toenails including 5 mm proximal and lateral fold area plus onycholysis to a maximal extent of 50 % .
PregnancyTeratogenic EffectsPregnancy category BTeratology studies in mice , rats , rabbits , and monkeys at oral doses of up to 77 , 23 , 23 , or 38 . 5 mg , respectively , of ciclopirox as ciclopirox olamine / kg / day ( 14 , 8 , 17 , and 28 times MRHTD ) , or in rats and rabbits receiving topical doses of up to 92 . 4 and 77 mg / kg / day , respectively ( 33 and 55 times MRHTD ) , did not indicate any significant fetal malformations .
There are no adequate or well - controlled studies of topically applied ciclopirox in pregnant women .
Ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Nursing MothersIt is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Since many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric UseBased on the safety profile in adults , ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) is considered safe for use in children twelve years and older .
No clinical trials have been conducted in the pediatric population .
Geriatric UseClinical studies of ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients .
ADVERSE REACTIONS In the vehicle - controlled clinical trials conducted in the US , 9 % ( 30 / 327 ) of patients treated with ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , and 7 % ( 23 / 328 ) of patients treated with vehicle reported treatment - emergent adverse events ( TEAE ) considered by the investigator to be causally related to the test material .
The incidence of these adverse events , within each body system , was similar between the treatment groups except for Skin and Appendages : 8 % ( 27 / 327 ) and 4 % ( 14 / 328 ) of subjects in the ciclopirox and vehicle groups reported at least one adverse event , respectively .
The most common were rash - related adverse events : periungual erythema and erythema of the proximal nail fold were reported more frequently in patients treated with ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , ( 5 % [ 16 / 327 ] ) than in patients treated with vehicle ( 1 % [ 3 / 328 ] ) .
Other TEAEs thought to be causally related included nail disorders such as shape change , irritation , ingrown toenail , and discoloration .
The incidence of nail disorders was similar between the treatment groups ( 2 % [ 6 / 327 ] in the ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , group and 2 % [ 7 / 328 ] in the vehicle group ) .
Moreover , application site reactions and / or burning of the skin occurred in 1 % of patients treated with ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , ( 3 / 327 ) and vehicle ( 4 / 328 ) .
A 21 Day Cumulative Irritancy study was conducted under conditions of semi - occlusion .
Mild reactions were seen in 46 % of patients with the ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , 32 % with the vehicle and 2 % with the negative control , but all were reactions of mild transient erythema .
There was no evidence of allergic contact sensitization for either the ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , or the vehicle base .
In a separate study of the photosensitization potential of ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) in a maximized test design that included the occluded application of sodium lauryl sulfate , no photoallergic reactions were noted .
In four subjects localized allergic contact reactions were observed .
In the vehicle - controlled studies , one patient treated with ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , discontinued treatment due to a rash , localized to the palm ( causal relation to test material undetermined ) .
Use of ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , for 48 additional weeks was evaluated in an open - label extension study conducted in patients previously treated in the vehicle - controlled studies .
Three percent ( 9 / 281 ) of subjects treated with ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , experienced at least one TEAE that the investigator thought was causally related to the test material .
Mild rash in the form of periungual erythema ( 1 % [ 2 / 281 ] ) and nail disorders ( 1 % [ 4 / 281 ] ) were the most frequently reported .
Four patients discontinued because of TEAEs .
Two of the four had events considered to be related to test material : one patient ’ s great toenail “ broke away ” and another had an elevated creatine phosphokinase level on Day 1 ( after 48 weeks of treatment with vehicle in the previous vehicle - controlled study ) .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Ciclopirox topical solution , 8 % ( nail lacquer ) , should be used as a component of a comprehensive management program for onychomycosis .
