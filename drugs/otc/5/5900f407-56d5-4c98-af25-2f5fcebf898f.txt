7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Moderate and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors : • For adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with a BSA greater than 1 . 50 m2 , reduce the dose of ROZLYTREK if coadministration of moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided .
( 2 . 5 , 7 . 1 ) • For pediatric patients 12 years and older with a BSA less than or equal to 1 . 50 m2 , avoid coadministration with ROZLYTREK .
( 7 . 1 ) • Moderate and Strong CYP3A Inducers : Avoid coadministration with ROZLYTREK .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Effect of Other Drugs on ROZLYTREK Moderate and Strong CYP3A Inhibitors Adults and Pediatric Patients 12 Years and Older with BSA Greater than 1 . 50 m2 Coadministration of ROZLYTREK with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor increases entrectinib plasma concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which could increase the frequency or severity of adverse reactions .
Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors with ROZLYTREK .
If coadministration is unavoidable , reduce the ROZLYTREK dose [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Pediatric Patients 12 Years and Older with BSA Less Than or Equal to 1 . 50 m2 Avoid coadministration of ROZLYTREK with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Avoid grapefruit products during treatment with ROZLYTREK , as they contain inhibitors of CYP3A .
Moderate and Strong CYP3A Inducers Coadministration of ROZLYTREK with a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer decreases entrectinib plasma concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , which may reduce ROZLYTREK efficacy .
Avoid coadministration of strong and moderate CYP3A inducers with ROZLYTREK .
7 . 2 Drugs That Prolong QT Interval QTc interval prolongation can occur with ROZLYTREK .
Avoid coadministration of ROZLYTREK with other products with a known potential to prolong QT / QTc interval [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on literature reports in humans with congenital mutations leading to changes in TRK signaling , findings from animal studies , and its mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] , ROZLYTREK can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no available data on ROZLYTREK use in pregnant women .
Administration of entrectinib to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in malformations at maternal exposures approximately 2 . 7 times the human exposure at the 600 mg dose ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data Published reports of individuals with congenital mutations in TRK pathway proteins suggest that decreases in TRK - mediated signaling are correlated with obesity , developmental delays , cognitive impairment , insensitivity to pain , and anhidrosis .
Animal Data Entrectinib administration to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at a dose of 200 mg / kg [ resulting in exposures up to 2 . 7 times the human exposure ( AUC ) at the 600 mg dose ] resulted in maternal toxicity and fetal malformations including body closure defects ( omphalocele and gastroschisis ) and malformations of the vertebrae , ribs , and limbs ( micromelia and adactyly ) , but not embryolethality .
Lower fetal weights and reduced skeletal ossification occurred at doses ≥ 12 . 5 and 50 mg / kg [ approximately 0 . 2 and 0 . 9 times the human exposure ( AUC ) at the 600 mg dose ] , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of entrectinib or its metabolites in human milk or their effects on either the breastfed child or on milk production .
Because of the potential adverse reactions in breastfed children from ROZLYTREK , advise a lactating woman to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with ROZLYTREK and for 7 days after the final dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating ROZLYTREK [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception ROZLYTREK can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ROZLYTREK and for at least 5 weeks following the final dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Males Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ROZLYTREK and for 3 months following the final dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ROZLYTREK in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with solid tumors that have an NTRK gene fusion have been established .
The effectiveness of ROZLYTREK in adolescent patients was established based on extrapolation of data from three open - label , single - arm clinical trials in adult patients with solid tumors harboring an NTRK gene fusion ( ALKA , STARTRK - 1 , and STARTRK - 2 ) and pharmacokinetic data in adolescents enrolled in STARTRK - NG .
ROZLYTREK doses based on body surface area in pediatric patients 12 years and older resulted in similar systemic exposure compared to that in adults who received a ROZLYTREK dose of 600 mg [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
There is limited clinical experience with ROZLYTREK in pediatric patients .
The safety of ROZLYTREK in pediatric patients 12 years of age and older was established based on extrapolation of data in adults and data from 30 pediatric patients enrolled in STARTRK - NG .
Of these 30 patients , 7 % were < 2 years ( n = 2 ) , 77 % were 2 to < 12 years ( n = 23 ) , 17 % were 12 to < 18 years ( n = 5 ) ; 57 % had metastatic disease ( n = 17 ) and 44 % had locally advanced disease ( n = 13 ) ; and all patients had received prior treatment for their cancer , including surgery , radiotherapy , or systemic therapy .
The most common cancers were neuroblastoma ( 47 % ) , primary CNS tumors ( 30 % ) , and sarcoma ( 10 % ) .
The median duration of exposure for all pediatric patients was 4 . 2 months ( range : 0 . 2 to 22 . 7 months ) .
Due to the small number of pediatric and adult patients , the single arm design of clinical studies of ROZLYTREK , and confounding factors such as differences in susceptibility to infections between pediatric and adult patients , it is not possible to determine whether the observed differences in the incidence of adverse reactions to ROZLYTREK are related to patient age or other factors .
In an expanded safety database that included 338 adult patients and 30 pediatric patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials , the Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities that occurred more frequently ( ≥ 5 % ) in pediatric patients ( n = 30 ) compared with adults ( n = 338 ) were neutropenia ( 27 % vs 2 % ) , bone fractures ( 23 % vs 5 % ) , increased weight ( 20 % vs 7 % ) , thrombocytopenia ( 10 % vs 0 . 3 % ) , lymphopenia ( 7 % vs 1 % ) , increased gamma - glutamyl transferase ( 7 % vs 0 % ) , and device - related infection ( 7 % vs 0 . 3 % ) .
Three pediatric patients discontinued ROZLYTREK due to an adverse reaction ( Grade 4 pulmonary edema , Grade 3 dyspnea , and Grade 4 pancreatitis ) .
The safety and effectiveness of ROZLYTREK in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age with solid tumors who have an NTRK gene fusion have not been established .
The safety and effectiveness of ROZLYTREK in pediatric patients with ROS1 - positive NSCLC have not been established .
Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In a 13 - week juvenile rat toxicology study , animals were dosed daily from post - natal day 7 to day 97 ( approximately equivalent to neonate to adulthood ) .
Entrectinib resulted in : • decreased body weight gain and delayed sexual maturation at doses ≥ 4 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 06 times the human exposure ( AUC ) at the 600 mg dose ) , • deficits in neurobehavioral assessments including functional observational battery and learning and memory ( at doses ≥ 8 mg / kg / day , approximately 0 . 14 times the human exposure at the 600 mg dose ) , and • decreased femur length at doses ≥ 16 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 18 times the human exposure at the 600 mg dose ) .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 355 patients who received ROZLYTREK across clinical trials , 25 % were 65 years or older , and 5 % were 75 years of age or older .
Clinical studies of ROZLYTREK did not include sufficient numbers of geriatric patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment ( CLcr 30 to < 90 mL / min calculated by Cockcroft - Gault equation ) .
ROZLYTREK has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild ( total bilirubin ≤ 1 . 5 times ULN ) hepatic impairment .
ROZLYTREK has not been studied in patients with moderate ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 to 3 times ULN ) and severe ( total bilirubin > 3 times ULN ) hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Entrectinib is an inhibitor of the tropomyosin receptor tyrosine kinases ( TRK ) TRKA , TRKB , and TRKC ( encoded by the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase [ NTRK ] genes NTRK1 , NTRK2 , and NTRK3 , respectively ) , proto - oncogene tyrosine - protein kinase ROS1 ( ROS1 ) , and anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) with IC50 values of 0 . 1 to 2 nM .
Entrectinib also inhibits JAK2 and TNK2 with IC50 values > 5 nM .
The major active metabolite of entrectinib , M5 , showed similar in vitro activity against TRK , ROS1 , and ALK .
Fusion proteins that include TRK , ROS1 , or ALK kinase domains can drive tumorigenic potential through hyperactivation of downstream signaling pathways leading to unconstrained cell proliferation .
Entrectinib demonstrated in vitro and in vivo inhibition of cancer cell lines derived from multiple tumor types harboring NTRK , ROS1 , and ALK fusion genes .
Entrectinib demonstrated steady - state brain - to - plasma concentration ratios of 0 . 4 – 2 . 2 in multiple animal species ( mice , rats , and dogs ) and demonstrated in vivo anti - tumor activity in mice with intracranial implantation of TRKA - and ALK - driven tumor cell lines .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Entrectinib exposure - response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic responses are unknown .
Cardiac Electrophysiology Across clinical trials , 3 . 1 % of 355 patients , who received ROZLYTREK at doses ranging from 100 mg to 2600 mg daily under fasting or fed conditions ( 75 % received 600 mg orally once daily ) and had at least one post - baseline ECG assessment , experienced QTcF interval prolongation of > 60 ms after starting ROZLYTREK and 0 . 6 % had a QTc interval > 500 ms [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics for entrectinib and its pharmacologically active major circulating metabolite M5 were characterized in adult patients with ROS1 - positive NSCLC , NTRK gene fusion - positive solid tumors , and healthy subjects .
The pharmacokinetics of entrectinib and M5 are linear and are not dose - dependent or time - dependent .
Steady state is achieved within one week for entrectinib and two weeks for M5 following daily administration of ROZLYTREK .
The pharmacokinetic parameters for entrectinib and M5 are described in Table 6 .
Table 6 : Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Entrectinib and Metabolite M5Parameter Entrectinib Mean [ 1 ] ( % CV ) M5 Mean null ( % CV ) AUCD1 ( nM * h ) 31800 ( 48 % ) 10200 ( 82 % ) AUCss ( nM * h ) 48000 ( 77 % ) 24000 ( 97 % ) CmaxD1 ( nM ) 2250 ( 58 % ) 622 ( 79 % ) Cmaxss ( nM ) 3130 ( 80 % ) 1250 ( 90 % ) Racc ( AUC ) 1 . 55 ( 49 % ) 2 . 84 ( 93 % ) [ 1 ] Geometric mean Absorption The maximum entrectinib plasma concentration was reached 4 – 6 hours after oral administration of a 600 mg dose .
Effect of Food A high - fat ( approximately 50 % of total caloric content ) , high - calorie ( approximately 800 to 1000 calories ) meal did not have a significant effect on entrectinib exposure .
Distribution Entrectinib and its active major metabolite M5 are both > 99 % bound to human plasma proteins in vitro .
The estimated apparent volume of distribution ( V / F ) was 551 L and 81 . 1 L for entrectinib and M5 , respectively .
Elimination The estimated apparent clearance ( CL / F ) was 19 . 6 L / h and 52 . 4 L / h for entrectinib and M5 , respectively .
The elimination half - lives of entrectinib and M5 were estimated to be 20 and 40 hours , respectively .
Metabolism Entrectinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 ( ~ 76 % ) .
The active metabolite M5 ( formed by CYP3A4 ) is the only major active circulating metabolite identified .
M5 has similar pharmacological potency to entrectinib in vitro and circulating M5 exposures at steady - state in patients were 40 % of the corresponding entrectinib exposure .
Excretion Following oral administration of a single oral dose of [ 14 C ] - labeled entrectinib , 83 % of radioactivity was excreted in feces ( 36 % of the dose as unchanged entrectinib and 22 % as M5 ) with minimal excretion in urine ( 3 % ) .
Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib were observed based on age ( 12 years to 86 years ) , sex , race ( White , Asian and Black ) , body weight ( 32 to 130 kg ) , mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr 30 to < 90 mL / min ) and mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin ≤ 1 . 5 times ULN ) .
The impact of moderate to severe hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of entrectinib is unknown .
Pediatric Patients The predicted systemic exposures for body surface area - based doses of 600 mg ( BSA > 1 . 50 m2 ) , 500 mg ( BSA of 1 . 11 to 1 . 50 m2 ) and 400 mg ( BSA of 0 . 91 to 1 . 10 m2 ) in pediatric patients 12 years and older are comparable to the exposure in adults at the 600 mg dose [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors on Entrectinib : Coadministration of itraconazole ( a strong CYP3A inhibitor ) with a single 100 mg ROZLYTREK dose increased entrectinib AUC0 - INF by 6 - fold and Cmax by 1 . 7 - fold [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Coadministration of a moderate CYP3A inhibitor with ROZLYTREK is predicted to increase entrectinib AUC0 - Tau by 3 - fold and Cmax by 2 . 9 - fold .
Effect of CYP3A Inducers on Entrectinib : Coadministration of rifampin ( a strong CYP3A inducer ) with a single 600 mg ROZLYTREK dose reduced entrectinib AUC0 - INF by 77 % and Cmax by 56 % [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Coadministration of a moderate CYP3A inducer with ROZLYTREK is predicted to reduce entrectinib AUC0 - Tau by 56 % and Cmax by 43 % .
Effect of Gastric Acid Reducing Drugs on Entrectinib : Coadministration of a proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) , lansoprazole with a single 600 mg ROZLYTREK dose reduced entrectinib AUC by 25 % and Cmax by 23 % .
Effect of Entrectinib on CYP Substrates : Coadministration of ROZLYTREK 600 mg once daily with oral midazolam ( a sensitive CYP3A substrate ) in patients increased the midazolam AUC by 50 % but reduced midazolam Cmax by 21 % [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Effect of Entrectinib on Transporters : Coadministration of a single 600 mg ROZLYTREK dose with digoxin [ a sensitive P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) substrate ] increased digoxin Cmax by 28 % and AUC by 18 % .
In Vitro Studies Entrectinib is not a substrate of P - gp or BCRP , but M5 is a substrate of P - gp and BCRP .
Entrectinib and M5 are not substrates of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies were not conducted with entrectinib .
Entrectinib was not mutagenic in vitro in the bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay ; however , an in vitro assay in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes did demonstrate a potential for abnormal chromosome segregation ( aneugenicity ) .
Entrectinib was not clastogenic or aneugenic in the in vivo micronucleus assay in rats and did not induce DNA damage in a comet assay in rats .
Dedicated fertility studies were not conducted with entrectinib .
With the exception of dose - dependent decreases in prostate weight in male dogs , there were no effects on male and female reproductive organs observed in general toxicology studies conducted in rats and dogs at doses resulting in exposures of up to approximately 3 . 2 fold the human exposure ( AUC ) at the 600 mg dose .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1ROS1 - Positive Non - Small Cell Lung Cancer The efficacy of ROZLYTREK was evaluated in a pooled subgroup of patients with ROS1 - positive metastatic NSCLC who received ROZLYTREK at various doses and schedules ( 90 % received ROZLYTREK 600 mg orally once daily ) and were enrolled in one of three multicenter , single - arm , open - label clinical trials : ALKA , STARTRK - 1 ( NCT02097810 ) and STARTRK - 2 ( NCT02568267 ) .
To be included in this pooled subgroup , patients were required to have histologically confirmed , recurrent or metastatic , ROS1 - positive NSCLC , ECOG performance status ≤ 2 , measurable disease per RECIST v 1 . 1 , ≥ 18 months of follow - up from first post - treatment tumor assessment , and no prior therapy with a ROS1 inhibitor .
Identification of ROS1 gene fusion in tumor specimens was prospectively determined in local laboratories using either a fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) , next - generation sequencing ( NGS ) , or polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) laboratory - developed tests .
All patients were assessed for CNS lesions at baseline .
The major efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate ( ORR ) and duration of response ( DOR ) according to RECIST v1 . 1 as assessed by blinded independent central review ( BICR ) .
Intracranial response according to RECIST v1 . 1 was assessed by BICR .
Tumor assessments with imaging were performed every 8 weeks .
Efficacy was assessed in 92 patients with ROS1 - positive NSCLC .
The median age was 53 years ( range : 27 to 86 ) ; female ( 65 % ) ; White ( 48 % ) , Asian ( 45 % ) , and Black ( 5 % ) ; and Hispanic or Latino ( 2 . 4 % ) ; never smoked ( 59 % ) ; and ECOG performance status 0 or 1 ( 88 % ) .
Ninety - nine percent of patients had metastatic disease , including 42 % with CNS metastases ; 96 % had adenocarcinoma ; 65 % received prior platinum - based chemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent disease and no patient had progressed in less than 6 months following platinum - based adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy .
ROS1 positivity was determined by NGS in 79 % , FISH in 16 % , and PCR in 4 % .
Twenty - five percent had central laboratory confirmation of ROS1 positivity using an analytically validated NGS test .
Efficacy results are summarized in Table 7 .

Responses in intracranial lesions were observed in 7 of these 10 patients .
14 . 2 NTRK Gene Fusion - Positive Solid Tumors The efficacy of ROZLYTREK was evaluated in a pooled subgroup of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with a NTRK gene fusion enrolled in one of three multicenter , single - arm , open - label clinical trials : ALKA , STARTRK - 1 ( NCT02097810 ) and STARTRK - 2 ( NCT02568267 ) .
To be included in this pooled subgroup , patients were required to have progressed following systemic therapy for their disease , if available , or would have required surgery causing significant morbidity for locally advanced disease ; measurable disease per RECIST v1 . 1 ; at least 2 years of follow - up from first post - treatment tumor assessment ; and no prior therapy with a TRK inhibitor .
Patients received ROZLYTREK at various doses and schedules ( 94 % received ROZLYTREK 600 mg orally once daily ) until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression .
Identification of positive NTRK gene fusion status was prospectively determined in local laboratories or a central laboratory using various nucleic acid - based tests .
The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DOR , as determined by a BICR according to RECIST v1 . 1 .
Intracranial response according to RECIST v1 . 1 as evaluated by BICR .
Tumor assessments with imaging were performed every 8 weeks .
Efficacy was assessed in the first 54 adult patients with solid tumors with an NTRK gene fusion enrolled into these trials .
The median age was 58 years ( range : 21 to 83 ) ; female ( 59 % ) ; White ( 80 % ) , Asian ( 13 % ) and Hispanic or Latino ( 7 % ) ; and ECOG performance status 0 ( 43 % ) or 1 ( 46 % ) .
Ninety - six percent of patients had metastatic disease , including 22 % with CNS metastases , and 4 % had locally advanced , unresectable disease .
All patients had received prior treatment for their cancer including surgery ( n = 43 ) , radiotherapy ( n = 36 ) , or systemic therapy ( n = 48 ) .
Forty patients ( 74 % ) received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease with a median of 1 prior systemic regimen and 17 % ( n = 9 ) received 3 or more prior systemic regimens .
The most common cancers were sarcoma ( 24 % ) , lung cancer ( 19 % ) , salivary gland tumors ( 13 % ) , breast cancer ( 11 % ) , thyroid cancer ( 9 % ) , and colorectal cancer ( 7 % ) .
A total of 52 ( 96 % ) patients had an NTRK gene fusion detected by NGS and 2 ( 4 % ) had an NTRK gene fusion detected by other nucleic acid - based tests .
Eighty - three percent of patients had central laboratory confirmation of NTRK gene fusion using an analytically validated NGS test .
