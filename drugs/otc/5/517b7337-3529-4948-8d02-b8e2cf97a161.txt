USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • In one study of 46 subjects who received Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi administration , the radioactivity in both children and adolescents exhibited blood PK profiles similar to those previously reported in adults .
• Lactation : Interruption of breastfeeding after exposure to Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi is not necessary , however , a lactating woman should be advised to consider restricting close contact with her breast fed infant to a maximum of 5 hours in the 24 hour period after Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi administration in order to minimize radiation exposure .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi use in pregnant women have not identified a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
Animal reproduction and teratogenicity studies have not been conducted with Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi .
However , all radiopharmaceuticals have the potential to cause fetal harm depending on the fetal stage of development and the magnitude of the radiation dose .
If considering Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi administration to a pregnant woman , inform the patient about the potential for adverse pregnancy outcomes based on the radiation dose from Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi and the gestational timing of exposure .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defects , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited data in the scientific literature on the presence of Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi in human milk , demonstrate that between 0 . 01 % and 0 . 03 % of maternal injected activity of technetium Tc99m Sestamibi was excreted in human milk .
Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi accumulates in the lactating breast [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
There are limited data in the scientific literature on effects of Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi on the breastfed infant or on milk production The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi or from the underlying maternal condition .
Clinical Considerations Interruption of breastfeeding after exposure to Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi is not necessary because Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi excretion in breast milk is low .
However , a lactating woman may restrict close contact with her breast fed infant to a maximum of 5 hours in the 24 hour period after Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi administration in order to minimize radiation exposure .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established .
No evidence of diagnostic efficacy or clinical utility of Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi scan was found in clinical studies of children and adolescents with Kawasaki disease .
A prospective study of 445 pediatric patients with Kawasaki disease was designed to determine the predictive value of Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi rest and stress myocardial perfusion imaging to define a pediatric population with Kawasaki disease that was at risk of developing cardiac events .
Cardiac events were defined as cardiac death , MI , hospitalization due to cardiac etiology , heart failure , CABG or coronary angioplasty .
The standard of truth was defined as cardiac events occurring 6 months following the administration of Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi .
Only three cardiac events were observed at six months in this study .
In all three cases , the scan was negative .
No clinically meaningful measurements of sensitivity , specificity or other diagnostic performance parameters could be demonstrated in this study .
A ten year retrospective case history study of pediatric Kawasaki disease patients who completed Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi myocardial perfusion imaging and who had coronary angiography within three months of the Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi scan was designed to measure sensitivity and specificity of Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi scan .
Out of 72 patients who had both evaluable Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi scans and evaluable angiographic images , only one patient had both an abnormal angiogram and an abnormal Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi scan .
No clinically meaningful measurements of sensitivity , specificity or other diagnostic performance parameters could be demonstrated in this study .
In a clinical pharmacology study , 46 pediatric patients with Kawasaki disease received Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi administration at the following doses : 0 . 1 - 0 . 2 mCi / kg for rest , 0 . 3 mCi / kg for stress in one day studies ; 0 . 2 mCi / kg for rest and 0 . 2 mCi / kg for stress in two day studies .
The radioactivity both in younger children and in adolescents exhibited PK profiles similar to those previously reported in adults ( See Section 12 ) .
The radiation absorbed doses in adolescents , both at rest and stress , were similar to those observed in adults ( see Section 2 ) .
When comparing weight - adjusted radioactivity ( up to 0 . 3 mCi / kg ) doses administered to adolescents and younger children to the recommended dose administered to adults ( up to 30 mCi ) , the radiation absorbed doses in both adolescents and younger children were similar to those in adults .
Adverse events were evaluated in 609 pediatric patients from the three clinical studies described above .
The frequency and the type of the adverse events were similar to the ones observed in the studies of Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi in adults .
Two of the 609 had a serious adverse event : one patient received a Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi overdose but remained asymptomatic , and one patient had an asthma exacerbation following administration .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of 3068 patients in clinical studies of Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi , 693 patients were 65 or older and 121 were 75 or older .
Of 673 patients in clinical studies of Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi , 138 patients were 65 or older and 30 were 75 or older .
Based on the evaluation of the frequency of adverse events and review of vital signs data , no overall differences in safety were observed between these subjects and younger subjects .
Although reported clinical experience has not identified differences in response between elderly and younger patients , greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi is a cationic Tc99m complex which has been found to accumulate in viable myocardial tissue in a manner analogous to that of thallous chloride Tl - 201 .
Scintigraphic images obtained in humans after the intravenous administration of the drug have been comparable to those obtained with thallous chloride Tl - 201 in normal and abnormal myocardial tissue .
Animal studies have shown that myocardial uptake is not blocked when the sodium pump mechanism is inhibited .
Although studies of subcellular fractionation and electron micrographic analysis of heart cell aggregates suggest that Tc99m Sestamibi cellular retention occurs specifically within the mitochondria as a result of electrostatic interactions , the clinical relevance of these findings has not been determined .
The mechanism of Tc99m Sestamibi localization in various types of breast tissue ( e . g . , benign , inflammatory , malignant , fibrous ) has not been established .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Pulmonary activity is negligible even immediately after injection .
Blood clearance studies indicate that the fast clearing component clears with a t1 / 2 of 4 . 3 minutes at rest , and clears with a t1 / 2 of 1 . 6 minutes under exercise conditions .
At five minutes post injection about 8 % of the injected dose remains in circulation .
There is less than 1 % protein binding of Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi in plasma .
The myocardial biological half - life is approximately six hours after a rest or exercise injection .
The biological half - life for the liver is approximately 30 minutes after a rest or exercise injection .
The effective half - life of clearance ( which includes both the biological half - life and radionuclide decay ) for the heart is approximately 3 hours , and for the liver is approximately 30 minutes , after a rest or exercise injection .
The ideal imaging time reflects the best compromise between heart count rate and surrounding organ uptake .
Myocardial uptake which is coronary flow dependent is 1 . 2 % of the injected dose at rest and 1 . 5 % of the injected dose at exercise .
Table 6 . 0 illustrates the biological clearance as well as effective clearance ( which includes biological clearance and radionuclide decay ) of Tc99m Sestamibi from the heart and liver .
[ Organ concentrations expressed as percentage of injected dose ; data based on an average of 5 subjects at rest and 5 subjects during exercise ] .

A study in a dog myocardial infarction model reported that the drug showed no redistribution of any consequence .
Definitive human studies to demonstrate possible redistribution have not been reported .
In patients with documented myocardial infarction , imaging revealed the infarct up to four hours post dose .
12 . 3 . 1 Metabolism The agent is excreted without any evidence of metabolism .
12 . 3 . 2 Elimination The major pathway for clearance of Tc99m Sestamibi is the hepatobiliary system .
Activity from the gall bladder appears in the intestines within one hour of injection .
Twenty - seven percent of the injected dose is excreted in the urine , and approximately thirty - three percent of the injected dose is cleared through the feces in 48 hours .

NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility In comparison with most other diagnostic technetium labeled radiopharmaceuticals , the radiation dose to the ovaries ( 1 . 5 rads / 30 mCi at rest , 1 . 2 rads / 30 mCi at exercise ) is high .
Minimal exposure ( ALARA ) is necessary in women of childbearing capability .
( See Section 2 . )
The active intermediate , Cu ( MIBI ) 4BF4 , was evaluated for genotoxic potential in a battery of five tests .
No genotoxic activity was observed in the Ames , CHO / HPRT and sister chromatid exchange tests ( all in vitro ) .
At cytotoxic concentrations ( > 20 µg / mL ) , an increase in cells with chromosome aberrations was observed in the in vitro human lymphocyte assay .
Cu ( MIBI ) 4BF4 did not show genotoxic effects in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test at a dose which caused systemic and bone marrow toxicity ( 9 mg / kg , > 600 × maximal human dose ) .

CLINICAL STUDIES CLINICAL TRIALS : MYOCARDIAL IMAGING : In a trial of rest and stress Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi imaging , the relationship of normal or abnormal perfusion scans and long term cardiac events was evaluated in 521 patients ( 511 men , 10 women ) with stable chest pain .
There were 73 . 9 % Caucasians , 25 . 9 % Blacks and 0 . 2 % Asians .
The mean age was 59 . 6 years ( range : 29 to 84 years ) .
All patients had a baseline rest and exercise Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi scan and were followed for 13 . 2 ± 4 . 9 months ( range : 1 to 24 months ) .
Images were correlated with the occurrence of a cardiac event ( cardiac death or non - fatal myocardial infarction ) .
In this trial as summarized in Table 7 . 0 , 24 / 521 ( 4 . 6 % ) had a cardiac event .
Table 7 . 0 Cardiac EventsBaseline Scan [ 1 ] Proportion of patients with events by scan results null Proportion of scan result in patients with events ; N = 24 null Proportion of event - free patients by scan result null Normal 1 / 206 ( 0 . 5 % ) 1 / 24 ( 4 . 2 % ) 205 / 206 ( 99 . 5 % ) Abnormal 23 / 315 ( 7 . 3 % ) [ 2 ] 23 / 24 ( 95 . 8 % ) null 292 / 315 ( 92 . 7 % ) null [ 1 ] Note : Similar findings were found in two studies with patients who had pharmacologic stress Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi imaging .
[ 2 ] p < 0 . 01 Although patients with normal images had a lower cardiac event rate than those with abnormal images , in all patients with abnormal images it was not possible to predict which patient would be likely to have further cardiac events ; i . e . , such individuals were not distinguishable from other patients with abnormal images .
The findings were not evaluated for defect location , disease duration , specific vessel involvement or intervening management .
In earlier trials , using a template consisting of the anterior wall , inferior - posterior wall and isolated apex , localization in the anterior or inferior - posterior wall in patients with suspected angina or coronary artery disease was shown .
Disease localization isolated to the apex has not been established .
In adults , Tc99m Sestamibi has not been studied or evaluated in cardiac disorders other than coronary artery disease .
BREAST IMAGING : Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi was evaluated in two multicenter , clinical trials of a total of 673 woman patients .
Overall the mean age was 52 ( range 23 to 87 years ) .
The racial and ethnic representation was 70 % Caucasian , 15 % African - American , 14 % Hispanic and 1 % Asian .
Both clinical studies evaluated women who were referred for further evaluation for either : 1 ) a mammographically detected ( with varying degrees of malignant likelihood ) but not palpable breast lesion ( study A , n = 387 , mean age = 54 years ) , or 2 ) a palpable breast lesion ( study B , n = 286 , mean age = 50 years ) .
In both studies all patients were scheduled for biopsy .
Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi ( 20 - 30 mCi ) was injected intravenously in a vein that was contralateral to the breast lesion in question .
Planar imaging was completed with a high resolution collimator with a 10 % window centered at 140 KeV , and 128 × 128 matrix .
An initial marker image , that was not used in the data analysis , was obtained using a cobalt Co57 point source as a marker of a palpable mass .
Images were obtained 5 minutes after injection as follows : lateral image of the affected breast for 10 minutes , lateral image of the contralateral breast for 10 minutes , and an anterior image of both breasts for 10 minutes .
For the lateral image the patients were positioned in a prone position .
For the anterior image , the patients were supine .
The Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi scintigraphic images were read in a randomized method by two groups of three blinded readers .
Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi uptake was scored as : normal ( no uptake ) , equivocal , low , moderate , or high uptake .
The results of Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi images and mammography were analyzed in comparison to histopathologic findings of malignant or non - malignant disease .
As shown in Table 8 . 0 for the 483 evaluable patients , the sensitivity and specificity of any degree of Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi uptake appear to vary with the presence or absence of palpable mass .

Overall , the studies were not designed to compare the performance of Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi with the performance of mammography in patients with breast densities or other coexistent breast tissue disorders .
In general the histology seems to correlate with the degree of Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi uptake .
As shown in Tables 9 . 0 and 10 . 0 , the majority of the normal Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi images are associated with non - malignant tissue ( 78 - 81 % ) and the majority of low , moderate or high uptake Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi images are associated with malignant disease ( 79 - 83 % ) .
In an individual patient , however , the intensity of Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi uptake can not be used to confirm the presence or absence of malignancy .
Equivocal results do not have a correlation with histology .

An estimate of the likelihood of malignancy based on the Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi uptake score in combination with the mammographic score has not been studied .
In these two studies approximately 150 additional , non - biopsied lesions were found to be positive after Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi imaging .
These lesions were identified in sites that did not physically correlate with identified entry criteria mammographic lesions and these lesions were not palpable .
These lesions were not biopsied .
Whether these lesions were benign or malignant is not known .
Technetium Tc99m Sestamibi uptake can occur in both benign and malignant disease .
THE CLINICAL USEFULNESS OF A POSITIVE TECHNETIUM Tc99M SESTAMIBI IMAGE IN THE ABSENCE OF AN ABNORMAL MAMMOGRAM OR A PALPABLE LESION IS NOT KNOWN .
