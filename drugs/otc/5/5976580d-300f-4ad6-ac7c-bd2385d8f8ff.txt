SPL UNCLASSIFIED SECTION For Dermatologic Use Rx Only DESCRIPTION SECTION Each gram of Mupirocin Ointment USP , 2 % contains 20 mg mupirocin in a bland water miscible ointment base ( polyethylene glycol ointment , NF ) consisting of polyethylene glycol 400 and polyethylene glycol 3350 .
Mupirocin is a naturally occurring antibiotic .
The chemical name is ( E ) - ( 2 S , 3 R , 4 R , 5 S ) - 5 - [ ( 2 S , 3 S , 4 S , 5 S ) - 2 , 3 - Epoxy - 5 - hydroxy - 4 - methylhexyl ] tetrahydro - 3 , 4 - dihydroxy - β - methyl - 2 H - pyran - 2 - crotonic acid , ester with 9 - hydroxynonanoic acid .
The molecular formula of mupirocin is C26H44O9 and the molecular weight is 500 . 62 .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION • Application of 14 C - labeled mupirocin ointment to the lower arm of normal male subjects followed by occlusion for 24 hours showed no measurable systemic absorption ( < 1 . 1 nanogram mupirocin per milliliter of whole blood ) .
Measurable radioactivity was present in the stratum corneum of these subjects 72 hours after application .
Following intravenous or oral administration , mupirocin is rapidly metabolized .
The principal metabolite , monic acid , is eliminated by renal excretion , and demonstrates no antibacterial activity .
In a study conducted in 7 healthy adult male subjects , the elimination half - life after intravenous administration of mupirocin was 20 to 40 minutes for mupirocin and 30 to 80 minutes for monic acid .
The pharmacokinetics of mupirocin has not been studied in individuals with renal insufficiency .
Microbiology - Mupirocin is an antibacterial agent produced by fermentation using the organism Pseudomonas fluorescens .
It is active against a wide range of gram - positive bacteria including methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) .
It is also active against certain gram - negative bacteria .
Mupirocin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by reversibly and specifically binding to bacterial isoleucyl transfer - RNA synthetase .
Due to this unique mode of action , mupirocin demonstrates no in vitro cross - resistance with other classes of antimicrobial agents .
Resistance occurs rarely .
However , when mupirocin resistance does occur , it appears to result from the production of a modified isoleucyl - tRNA synthetase .
High - level plasmid - mediated resistance ( MIC > 1024 mcg / mL ) has been reported in some strains of S . aureus and coagulase - negative staphylococci .
Mupirocin is bactericidal at concentrations achieved by topical administration .
However , the minimum bactericidal concentration ( MBC ) against relevant pathogens is generally 8 - fold to 30 - fold higher than the minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) .
In addition , mupirocin is highly protein bound ( > 97 % ) , and the effect of wound secretions on the MICs of mupirocin has not been determined .
Mupirocin has been shown to be active against most strains of S . aureusand Streptococcus pyogenes , both in vitro and in clinical studies ( see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) .
The following in vitro data are available , BUT THEIR CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE IS UNKNOWN .
Mupirocin is active against most strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus .
INDICATIONS & USAGE SECTION Mupirocin Ointment USP , 2 % is indicated for the topical treatment of impetigo due to : S . aureusand S . pyogenes .
CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION This drug is contraindicated in individuals with a history of sensitivity reactions to any of its components .
WARNINGS SECTION Mupirocin Ointment USP , 2 % is not for ophthalmic use PRECAUTIONS SECTION • If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur with the use of Mupirocin Ointment USP , 2 % , treatment should be discontinued and appropriate alternative therapy for the infection instituted .
As with other antibacterial products , prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms , including fungi .
Mupirocin Ointment USP , 2 % is not formulated for use on mucosal surfaces .
Intranasal use has been associated with isolated reports of stinging and drying .
A paraffin - based formulation - * Bactroban Nasal ® ( mupirocin calcium ointment ) – is available for intranasal use .
Polyethylene glycol can be absorbed from open wounds and damaged skin and is excreted by the kidneys .
In common with other polyethylene glycol - based ointments , Mupirocin Ointment USP , 2 % should not be used in conditions where absorption of large quantities of polyethylene glycol is possible , especially if there is evidence of moderate or severe renal impairment .
Information for Patients - Use this medication only as directed by your healthcare provider .
It is for external use only .
Avoid contact with the eyes .
The medication should be stopped and your healthcare practitioner contacted if irritation , severe itching , or rash occurs .
If impetigo has not improved in 3 to 5 days , contact your healthcare practitioner .
Drug Interactions - The effect of the concurrent application of Mupirocin Ointment USP , 2 % and other drug products has not been studied .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility - Long - term studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential of mupirocin have not been conducted .
Results of the following studies performed with mupirocin calcium or mupirocin sodium in vitro and in vivo did not indicate a potential for genotoxicity : Rat primary hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis , sediment analysis for DNA strand breaks , Salmonella reversion test ( Ames ) , Escherichia coli mutation assay , metaphase analysis of human lymphocytes , mouse lymphoma assay , and bone marrow micronuclei assay in mice .
Reproduction studies were performed in male and female rats with mupirocin administered subcutaneously at doses up to 14 times a human topical dose ( approximately 60 mg mupirocin per day ) on a mg / m2 basis and revealed no evidence of impaired fertility and reproductive performance from mupirocin .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects - Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits with mupirocin administered subcutaneously at doses up to 22 and 43 times , respectively , the human topical dose ( approximately 60 mg mupirocin per day ) on a mg / m2 basis and revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to mupirocin .
There are however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response , this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers - It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when Mupirocin Ointment USP , 2 % is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use - The safety and effectiveness of Mupirocin Ointment USP , 2 % have been established in the age range of 2 months to 16 years .
Use of mupirocin ointment USP , 2 % in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies of mupirocin ointment USP , 2 % in impetigo in pediatric patients studied as part of the pivotal clinical trials ( see CLINICAL STUDIES ) .
