[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] DRAXIMAGE ® MDP - 25 Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc 99 m Medronate Injection For Intravenous Use DIAGNOSTIC – FOR SKELETAL IMAGING DESCRIPTION The kit consists of reaction vials which contain the sterile , non - pyrogenic , non - radioactive ingredients necessary to produce Technetium Tc 99 m Medronate Injection for diagnostic use by intravenous injection .
MDP - 25 reaction vials are intended to be used as multidose vials .
Each 10 mL MDP - 25 reaction vial contains 25 . 0 mg medronic acid and not less than 2 . 0 mg of stannous chloride dihydrate ( maximum total tin expressed as stannous chloride dihydrate 3 . 0 mg ) and 5 . 0 mg of p - aminobenzoic acid in lyophilized form under an atmosphere of nitrogen .
The pH is adjusted to 6 . 8 to 6 . 9 with HCI or NaOH prior to lyophilization .
The addition of sterile , non - pyrogenic , and oxidant - free sodium pertechnetate Tc - 99 m sterile solution produces a rapid labeling which is essentially quantitative and which remains stable in vitro throughout the 12 - hours life of the preparation .
No bacteriostatic preservative is present .
The structural formula of medronic acid is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS Technetium Tc - 99 m decays by isomeric transition with a physical half - life of 6 . 02 hours . 1 The principal photon that is useful for detection and imaging studies is listed in Table 1 .
Table 1 Principal Radiation Emission Data Radiation Mean % / Disintegration Energy ( keV ) Gamma - 2 89 . 07 140 . 5 EXTERNAL RADIATION The specific gamma ray constant for Tc - 99 m is 0 . 78 R / mCi - hr at 1 cm .
The first half value layer is 0 . 017 cm of lead .
To facilitate control of the radiation exposure from millicurie amounts of this radionuclide , the use of a 0 . 25 cm thickness of lead will attenuate the radiation emitted by a factor of about 1000 .
A range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of lead is shown in Table 2 .

About 10 % of the injected dose remains in the blood at 1 hour post - injection , 5 % at 2 hours , and less than 1 % remains at 24 hours .
The resultant blood clearance curve is tri - exponential with the two fastest components accounting for all but a few percent of the injected dose .
Following intravenous administration of Technetium Tc 99 m Medronate , skeletal uptake occurs as a function of blood flow to bone and bone efficiency in extracting the complex .
Bone mineral crystals are generally considered to be hydroxyapatite , and the complex appears to have an affinity for the hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone .
The rapid blood clearance provides bone to soft - tissue ratios which favor early imaging .
The skeletal uptake is bilaterally symmetrical and is greater in the axial skeleton than in the long bones .
Areas of abnormal osteogenesis show altered uptake making it possible to visualize a variety of osseous lesions .
INDICATIONS & USAGE MDP - 25 ( Kit for the Preparation of Technetium Tc 99 m Medronate ) may be used as a bone imaging agent to delineate areas of altered osteogenesis .
CONTRAINDICATIONS None known at present .
WARNINGS This class of compounds is known to complex cations such as calcium .
Particular caution should be used with patients who have , or who may be predisposed to , hypocalcemia ( i . e . , alkalosis ) .
The contents of the kit before preparation are not radioactive .
However , after the sodium pertechnetate Tc - 99 m is added , adequate shielding of the final preparation must be maintained .
Preliminary reports indicate impairment of brain images using Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m Injection which have been preceded by bone imaging using an agent containing stannous ions .
The impairment may result in false - positive or false - negative brain images .
It is recommended , where feasible , that brain imaging using Sodium Pertechnetate Tc 99 m Injection precede bone imaging procedures .
Alternatively , a brain imaging agent such as technetium Tc - 99 m pentetate may be employed .
PRECAUTIONS Contents of the reaction vial are intended only for use in the preparation of Technetium Tc 99 m Medronate and are NOT to be administered directly to the patient .

MDP - 25 reaction vials are intended for the preparation of multiple doses of Technetium Tc 99 Medronate and the entire contents of the vial should not be used as a single dose .
Before reconstituting a vial , it should be inspected for cracks and / or a melted plug or any other indication that the integrity of the vacuum seal has been compromised .
To prepare Technetium Tc 99 m Medronate : • Remove the central metal disc from a reaction vial and swab the closure with either an alcohol swab or a suitable bacteriostatic agent .
• Place the reaction vial in a suitable lead vial shield ( minimum wall thickness 1 / 8 inch ) which has a fitted lead cap .
Obtain 2 to 10 mL of sterile , non - pyrogenic sodium pertechnetate Tc - 99 m , using a shielded syringe .
The recommended maximum amount of Technetium Tc - 99 m to be added to a reaction vial is 37 . 0 gigabecquerels ( 1000 mCi ) .
Sufficient sodium pertechnetate is to be used for the reconstitution of a reaction vial to ensure that the dose of medronate administered does not exceed 10 mg .
Sodium pertechnetate Tc - 99 m solutions containing an oxidizing agent are not suitable for use .
• Using a shielded syringe , add the sodium pertechnetate Tc - 99 m solution to the reaction vial aseptically .
• Place the lead cap on the reaction vial shield and agitate the shielded reaction vial until the contents are completely dissolved .
The solution must be clear and free of particulate matter before proceeding .
• Assay the product in a suitable calibrator , record the radioassay information on the label with radiation warning symbol , and apply it to the reaction vial .
• Withdrawals for administration must be made aseptically using a shielded sterile syringe and needle .
Since the reaction vials contain nitrogen to prevent oxidation of the complex , they should not be vented .
If repeated withdrawals are made , minimize the replacement of contents with room air .
