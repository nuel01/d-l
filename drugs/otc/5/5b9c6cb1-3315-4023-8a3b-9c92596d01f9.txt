Patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction were not studied .
Insufficient numbers of non - White patients were available to draw conclusions in these clinical trials .
Serious adverse reactions that occurred in patients receiving Decitabine for Injection not previously reported in Tables 1 and 2 include : • Allergic Reaction : hypersensitivity ( anaphylactic reaction ) • Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : myelosuppression , splenomegaly • Cardiac Disorders : myocardial infarction , cardio - respiratory arrest , cardiomyopathy , atrial fibrillation , supraventricular tachycardia • Gastrointestinal Disorders : gingival pain , upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage • General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions : chest pain , catheter site hemorrhage • Hepatobiliary Disorders : cholecystitis • Infections and Infestations : fungal infection , sepsis , bronchopulmonary aspergillosis , peridiverticular abscess , respiratory tract infection , pseudomonal lung infection , Mycobacterium avium complex infection • Injury , Poisoning and Procedural Complications : post procedural pain , post procedural hemorrhage • Nervous System Disorders : intracranial hemorrhage • Psychiatric Disorders : mental status changes • Renal and Urinary Disorders : renal failure , urethral hemorrhage • Respiratory , Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders : hemoptysis , lung infiltration , pulmonary embolism , respiratory arrest , pulmonary mass 6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of Decitabine for Injection .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Sweet ’ s Syndrome ( acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis ) • Differentiation syndrome • Interstitial lung disease 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drug interaction studies with decitabine have not been conducted .
In vitro studies in human liver microsomes suggest that decitabine is unlikely to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzymes .
In vitro metabolism studies have suggested that decitabine is not a substrate for human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes .
As plasma protein binding of decitabine is negligible ( < 1 % ) , interactions due to displacement of more highly protein bound drugs from plasma proteins are not expected .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from human data , animal studies , and the mechanism of action , Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Limited published data on Decitabine for Injection use throughout the first trimester during pregnancy describe adverse developmental outcomes including major birth defects ( structural abnormalities ) .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of decitabine to pregnant mice and rats during organogenesis caused adverse developmental outcomes including malformations and embryo - fetal lethality starting at doses approximately 7 % of the recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the U . S . general population is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies , respectively .
Data Human Data A single published case report of decitabine pregnancy exposure in a 39 - year old woman with a hematologic malignancy described multiple structural abnormalities after 6 cycles of therapy in the 18 th week of gestation .
These abnormalities included holoprosencephaly , absence of nasal bone , mid - facial deformity , cleft lip and palate , polydactyly and rocker - bottom feet .
The pregnancy was terminated .
Animal Data In utero exposure to decitabine causes temporal related defects in the rat and / or mouse , which include growth suppression , exencephaly , defective skull bones , rib / sternabrae defects , phocomelia , digit defects , micrognathia , gastroschisis , micromelia .
Decitabine inhibits proliferation and increases apoptosis of neural progenitor cells of the fetal CNS and induces palatal clefting in the developing murine fetus .
Studies in mice have also shown that decitabine administration during osteoblastogenesis ( day 10 of gestation ) induces bone loss in offspring .
In mice exposed to single IP ( intraperitoneal ) injections ( 0 , 0 . 9 and 3 . 0 mg / m2 , approximately 2 % and 7 % of the recommended daily clinical dose , respectively ) over gestation days 8 , 9 , 10 or 11 , no maternal toxicity was observed but reduced fetal survival was observed after treatment at 3 mg / m2 and decreased fetal weight was observed at both dose levels .
The 3 mg / m2 dose elicited characteristic fetal defects for each treatment day , including supernumerary ribs ( both dose levels ) , fused vertebrae and ribs , cleft palate , vertebral defects , hind - limb defects and digital defects of fore - and hind - limbs .
In rats given a single IP injection of 2 . 4 , 3 . 6 or 6 mg / m2 ( approximately 5 % , 8 % , or 13 % the daily recommended clinical dose , respectively ) on gestation days 9 to 12 , no maternal toxicity was observed .
No live fetuses were seen at any dose when decitabine was injected on gestation day 9 .
A significant decrease in fetal survival and reduced fetal weight at doses greater than 3 . 6 mg / m2 was seen when decitabine was given on gestation day 10 .
Increased incidences of vertebral and rib anomalies were seen at all dose levels , and induction of exophthalmia , exencephaly , and cleft palate were observed at 6 . 0 mg / m2 .
Increased incidence of foredigit defects was seen in fetuses at doses greater than 3 . 6 mg / m2 .
Reduced size and ossification of long bones of the fore - limb and hind - limb were noted at 6 . 0 mg / m2 .
The effect of decitabine on postnatal development and reproductive capacity was evaluated in mice administered a single 3 mg / m2 IP injection ( approximately 7 % the recommended daily clinical dose ) on day 10 of gestation .
Body weights of males and females exposed in utero to decitabine were significantly reduced relative to controls at all postnatal time points .
No consistent effect on fertility was seen when female mice exposed in utero were mated to untreated males .
Untreated females mated to males exposed in utero showed decreased fertility at 3 and 5 months of age ( 36 % and 0 % pregnancy rate , respectively ) .
Follow up studies indicated that treatment of pregnant mice with decitabine on gestation day 10 was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate resulting from effects on sperm production in the F1 - generation .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of decitabine or its metabolites in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions from Decitabine for Injection in a breastfed child , advise women not to breastfeed while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for at least 2 weeks after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Conduct pregnancy testing of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating Decitabine for Injection .
Contraception Females Decitabine for Injection can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving Decitabine for Injection and for 6 months following the last dose .
Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception while receiving treatment with Decitabine for Injection and for 3 months following the last dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Infertility Based on findings of decitabine in animals , male fertility may be compromised by treatment with Decitabine for Injection .
The reversibility of the effect on fertility is unknown [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Decitabine for Injection in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients exposed to Decitabine for Injection in the controlled clinical trial , 61 of 83 patients were age 65 years and over , while 21 of 83 patients were age 75 years and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known antidote for overdosage with Decitabine for Injection .
Higher doses are associated with increased myelosuppression including prolonged neutropenia and thrombocytopenia .
Standard supportive measures should be taken in the event of an overdose .
11 DESCRIPTION Decitabine is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor .
Decitabine is a fine , white to almost white powder with the molecular formula of C8H12N4O4 and a molecular weight of 228 . 21 .
Its chemical name is 4 - amino - 1 - ( 2 - deoxy - β - D - erythro - pentofuranosyl ) - 1 , 3 , 5 - triazin - 2 ( 1 H ) - one and it has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Decitabine is slightly soluble in ethanol / water ( 50 / 50 ) , methanol / water ( 50 / 50 ) and methanol ; sparingly soluble in water and soluble in dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) .
Decitabine for Injection , for intravenous use , is a sterile , white to almost white lyophilized powder supplied in a clear colorless glass single - dose vial .
Each 20 mL vial contains 50 mg decitabine , 68 mg monobasic potassium phosphate ( potassium dihydrogen phosphate ) and 11 . 6 mg sodium hydroxide .
Sodium hydroxide and / or hydrochloric acid are used for pH adjustment .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Decitabine is believed to exert its antineoplastic effects after phosphorylation and direct incorporation into DNA and inhibition of DNA methyltransferase , causing hypomethylation of DNA and cellular differentiation or apoptosis .
Decitabine inhibits DNA methylation in vitro , which is achieved at concentrations that do not cause major suppression of DNA synthesis .
Decitabine - induced hypomethylation in neoplastic cells may restore normal function to genes that are critical for the control of cellular differentiation and proliferation .
In rapidly dividing cells , the cytotoxicity of decitabine may also be attributed to the formation of covalent adducts between DNA methyltransferase and decitabine incorporated into DNA .
Non - proliferating cells are relatively insensitive to decitabine .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Decitabine has been shown to induce hypomethylation both in vitro and in vivo .
However , there have been no studies of decitabine - induced hypomethylation and pharmacokinetic parameters .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) parameters were evaluated in patients .
Eleven patients received 20 mg / m2 infused over 1 hour intravenously ( treatment Option 2 ) .
Fourteen patients received 15 mg / m2 infused over 3 hours intravenously ( treatment Option 1 ) .
PK parameters are shown in Table 3 .
Plasma concentration - time profiles after discontinuation of infusion showed a biexponential decline .
The clearance ( CL ) of decitabine was higher following treatment Option 2 .
Upon repeat doses , there was no systemic accumulation of decitabine or any changes in PK parameters .
Population PK analysis ( N = 35 ) showed that the cumulative AUC per cycle for treatment Option 2 was 2 . 3 - fold lower than the cumulative AUC per cycle following treatment Option 1 .

One of the pathways of elimination of decitabine appears to be deamination by cytidine deaminase found principally in the liver but also in granulocytes , intestinal epithelium and whole blood .
Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment There are no data on the use of Decitabine for Injection in patients with renal impairment .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment There are no data on the use of Decitabine for Injection in patients with hepatic impairment .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with decitabine have not been conducted .
The mutagenic potential of decitabine was tested in several in vitro and in vivo systems .
Decitabine increased mutation frequency in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells , and mutations were produced in an Escherichia coli lac - I transgene in colonic DNA of decitabine - treated mice .
Decitabine caused chromosomal rearrangements in larvae of fruit flies .
In male mice given IP injections of 0 . 15 , 0 . 3 or 0 . 45 mg / m2 decitabine ( approximately 0 . 3 % to 1 % the recommended clinical dose ) 3 times a week for 7 weeks , decitabine did not affect survival , body weight gain or hematological measures ( hemoglobin and white blood cell counts ) .
Testes weights were reduced , abnormal histology was observed and significant decreases in sperm number were found at doses ≥ 0 . 3 mg / m2 .
In females mated to males dosed with ≥ 0 . 3 mg / m2 decitabine , pregnancy rate was reduced and preimplantation loss was significantly increased .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Controlled Trial in Myelodysplastic Syndrome A randomized open - label , multicenter , controlled trial evaluated 170 adult patients with myelodysplastic syndromes ( MDS ) meeting French - American - British ( FAB ) classification criteria and International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) High - Risk , Intermediate - 2 and Intermediate - 1 prognostic scores .
Eighty - nine patients were randomized to Decitabine for Injection therapy plus supportive care ( only 83 received Decitabine for Injection ) , and 81 to Supportive Care ( SC ) alone .
Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) were not intended to be included .
Of the 170 patients included in the study , independent review ( adjudicated diagnosis ) found that 12 patients ( 9 in the Decitabine for Injection arm and 3 in the SC arm ) had the diagnosis of AML at baseline .
Baseline demographics and other patient characteristics in the Intent - to - Treat ( ITT ) population were similar between the 2 groups , as shown in Table 4 .

This cycle was repeated every 6 weeks , depending on the patient ’ s clinical response and toxicity .
Supportive care consisted of blood and blood product transfusions , prophylactic antibiotics , and hematopoietic growth factors .
The study endpoints were overall response rate ( complete response + partial response ) and time to AML or death .
Responses were classified using the MDS International Working Group ( IWG ) criteria ; patients were required to be RBC and platelet transfusion independent during the time of response .
Response criteria are given in Table 5 .

Complete Response ( CR ) ≥ 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates : • < 5 % myeloblasts • No dysplastic changes Peripheral Blood In all samples during response : • Hgb > 11 g / dL ( no transfusions or erythropoietin • ANC ≥ 1500 / µL ( no growth factor ) • Platelets ≥ 100 , 000 / µL ( no thrombopoietic agent ) • No blasts and no dysplasia Partial Response ( PR ) ≥ 8 weeks Bone Marrow On repeat aspirates : • ≥ 50 % decrease in blasts over pretreatment values OR • Improvement to a less advanced MDS FAB classification Peripheral Blood Same as for CR The overall response rate ( CR + PR ) in the ITT population was 17 % in Decitabine for Injection - treated patients and 0 % in the SC group ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( see Table 6 ) .
The overall response rate was 21 % ( 12 / 56 ) in Decitabine for Injection - treated patients considered evaluable for response ( i . e . , those patients with pathologically confirmed MDS at baseline who received at least 2 cycles of treatment ) .
The median duration of response ( range ) for patients who responded to Decitabine for Injection was 288 days ( 116 to 388 ) and median time to response ( range ) was 93 days ( 55 to 272 ) .
All but one of the Decitabine for Injection - treated patients who responded did so by the fourth cycle .
Benefit was seen in an additional 13 % of Decitabine for Injection - treated patients who had hematologic improvement , defined as a response less than PR lasting at least 8 weeks , compared to 7 % of SC patients .
Decitabine for Injection treatment did not significantly delay the median time to AML or death versus supportive care .

Responses occurred in patients with an adjudicated baseline diagnosis of AML .
14 . 2 Single - arm Studies in Myelodysplastic Syndrome Three open - label , single - arm , multicenter studies were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Decitabine for Injection in MDS patients with any of the FAB subtypes .
In one study conducted in North America , 99 patients with IPSS Intermediate - 1 , Intermediate - 2 , or high - risk prognostic scores received Decitabine for Injection 20 mg / m2 as an intravenous infusion over 1 - hour daily , on days 1 to 5 of week 1 every 4 weeks ( 1 cycle ) .
The results were consistent with the results of the controlled trial and are summarized in Table 8 .
