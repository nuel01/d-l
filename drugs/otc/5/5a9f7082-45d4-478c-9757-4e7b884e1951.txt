Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and use of effective contraception ( 5 . 4 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) .
5 . 1 Risks of Substitution with Other Azacitidine Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , the recommended dose and schedule for ONUREG are different from those for the intravenous or subcutaneous azacitidine products .
Treatment of patients using intravenous or subcutaneous azacitidine at the recommended dosage of ONUREG may result in a fatal adverse reaction .
Treatment of patients using ONUREG at the doses recommended for intravenous or subcutaneous azacitidine may not be effective .
Do not substitute ONUREG for intravenous or subcutaneous azacitidine [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 2 Myelosuppression New or worsening Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 49 % and 22 % of patients who received ONUREG , respectively .
Febrile neutropenia occurred in 12 % .
A dose reduction was required for 7 % and 2 % of patients due to neutropenia and thrombocytopenia , respectively .
Less than 1 % of patients discontinued ONUREG due to either neutropenia or thrombocytopenia .
Monitor complete blood counts and modify the dosage as recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 ) ] .
Provide standard supportive care , including hematopoietic growth factors , if myelosuppression occurs .
5 . 3 Increased Early Mortality in Patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes In AZA - MDS - 003 ( NCT01566695 ) , 216 patients with red blood cell transfusion - dependent anemia and thrombocytopenia due to myelodysplastic syndromes were randomized to ONUREG or placebo .
One - hundred and seven patients received a median of 5 cycles of ONUREG 300 mg daily for 21 days of a 28 - day cycle .

8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] and findings in animals , ONUREG can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no available data on ONUREG use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug - associated risk .
Azacitidine was teratogenic and caused embryo - fetal lethality in animals at doses less than the recommended human daily dose of oral azacitidine on a mg / m2 basis ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus .
The estimated background of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data No reproductive or developmental toxicity studies have been conducted with oral azacitidine .
Early embryotoxicity studies in mice revealed a 44 % frequency of intrauterine embryonal death ( increased resorption ) after a single intraperitoneal injection of 6 mg / m2 azacitidine ( at doses less than the recommended human daily dose of oral azacitidine on a mg / m2 basis ) on gestation Day 10 .
Developmental abnormalities in the brain have been detected in mice given azacitidine on or before gestation Day 15 at doses of approximately 3 to 12 mg / m2 ( at doses less than the recommended human daily dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
In rats , azacitidine was clearly embryotoxic when given an intraperitoneal injection on gestation Days 4 to 8 ( postimplantation ) at a dose of 6 mg / m2 ( at doses less than the recommended human daily dose on a mg / m2 basis ) , although treatment in the preimplantation period ( on gestation Days 1 to 3 ) had no adverse effect on the embryos .
Azacitidine caused multiple fetal abnormalities in rats after a single intraperitoneal dose of 3 to 12 mg / m2 ( at doses less than the recommended human daily dose on a mg / m2 basis ) given on gestation Days 9 , 10 , 11 , or 12 .
In this study , azacitidine caused fetal death when administered at 3 to 12 mg / m2 on gestation Days 9 and 10 ; average live animals per litter was reduced to 9 % of control at the highest dose on gestation Day 9 .
Fetal anomalies included : CNS anomalies ( exencephaly / encephalocele ) , limb anomalies ( micromelia , club foot , syndactyly , oligodactyly ) , and others ( micrognathia , gastroschisis , edema , and rib abnormalities ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data regarding the presence of azacitidine in human milk or the effects on the breastfed child or milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with ONUREG and for 1 week after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential ONUREG can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy testing is recommended for females of reproductive potential before starting ONUREG .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ONUREG and for at least 6 months after the last dose .
Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with ONUREG and for at least 3 months after the last dose .

8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ONUREG in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 238 patients in QUAZAR who received ONUREG , 72 % were 65 years of age or older , while 12 % were 75 years of age or older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of ONUREG were observed between these patients and younger patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Monitor patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance [ CLcr ] 15 to 29 mL / min calculated by Cockcroft - Gault formula ) more frequently for adverse reactions and modify the ONUREG dosage for adverse reactions [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
No dose adjustment of ONUREG is recommended for patients with mild to severe renal impairment ( CLcr 15 to 89 mL / min ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment ONUREG has not been studied in patients with pre - existing severe hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 3 × ULN ) .
A recommended dosage of ONUREG has not been established for patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 to 3 × ULN ) .
No dose adjustment of ONUREG is recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN , or total bilirubin 1 to 1 . 5 × ULN and any AST ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine that inhibits DNA / RNA methyltransferases .
Azacitidine is incorporated into DNA and RNA following cellular uptake and enzymatic biotransformation to nucleotide triphosphates .
Incorporation of azacitidine into the DNA of cancer cells in vitro , including acute myeloid leukemia cells , inhibited DNA methyltransferases , reduced DNA methylation and altered gene expression , including re - expression of genes regulating tumor suppression and cell differentiation .
Incorporation of azacitidine into the RNA of cancer cells , including leukemic cells , inhibited RNA methyltransferases , reduced RNA methylation , decreased RNA stability and decreased protein synthesis .
Antileukemic activity of azacitidine was demonstrated by reduction of cell viability and induction of apoptosis in AML cell lines in vitro .
Azacitidine decreased tumor burden and increased survival in leukemic tumor models in vivo .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Greater reduction in global DNA methylation was observed with higher azacitidine plasma exposure in patients with AML administered ONUREG for 14 days of a 28 - day cycle .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The systemic exposure of azacitidine is approximately dose proportional over the dose range of 120 mg to 600 mg once daily of ONUREG ( 0 . 4 to 2 times the recommended dosage ) .
Following a single 300 mg dose of ONUREG , the mean ( coefficient of variation [ CV % ] ) Cmax of azacitidine was 145 ng / mL ( 64 % ) and the mean AUC of azacitidine was 242 ng h / mL ( 65 % ) .
No accumulation was observed following ONUREG 300 mg once daily .
Absorption The mean oral bioavailability is approximately 11 % relative to subcutaneous administration .
The median time to peak plasma concentration of azacitidine is 1 hour .
Effect of Food A high - fat , high - calorie meal ( approximately 800 to 1000 calories , 50 % fat ) did not affect AUC0 - INF and decreased Cmax by 21 % .
Distribution The mean ( CV % ) apparent volume of distribution ( Vz / F ) of azacitidine is 881 L ( 67 % ) .
The in vitro serum protein binding of azacitidine is approximately 6 % to 12 % .
The blood - to - plasma ratio is approximately 0 . 3 .
Elimination The mean ( CV % ) terminal half - life is approximately 0 . 5 hours ( 27 % ) and the apparent clearance ( CL / F ) is 1240 L / hour ( 64 % ) .
Metabolism Azacitidine undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination mediated by cytidine deaminase .
Excretion Following the administration of ONUREG 300 mg orally once daily , < 2 % of the dose was recovered unchanged in the urine .
Specific Populations Age ( 46 years to 93 years ) , sex , body weight ( 39 . 3 kg to 129 kg ) , mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN , or total bilirubin 1 to 1 . 5 × ULN and any AST ) , and mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr 30 to 89 mL / min ) have no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral azacitidine .
The effects of race / ethnicity , moderate to severe hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 × ULN and any AST ) , and severe renal impairment ( CLcr 15 to 29 mL / min ) on the pharmacokinetics of oral azacitidine is unknown .
Severe renal impairment increased azacitidine exposure by approximately 70 % after a single or 41 % after multiple subcutaneous daily administration .
Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Gastric Acid Reducing Agents on Azacitidine : Coadministration of omeprazole ( a proton pump inhibitor ) with ONUREG increased azacitidine AUC0 - INF by 19 % and had no effect on Cmax .
In Vitro Studies Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) Enzymes : Azacitidine does not inhibit CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP3A4 , or CYP2E1 at clinically relevant concentrations .
Azacitidine is not an inducer of CYP1A2 , CYP2C19 , or CYP3A .
Transporter Systems : Azacitidine is not a substrate of P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) .
Azacitidine does not inhibit P - gp , breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) , organic anion transporters ( OAT ) OAT1 and OAT3 , organic anion transporting polypeptides ( OATP ) OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 , or organic cation transporter ( OCT ) OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility The potential carcinogenicity of azacitidine was evaluated in mice and rats .
Azacitidine induced tumors of the hematopoietic system in female mice at 2 . 2 mg / kg ( 6 . 6 mg / m2 , approximately 4 % of the recommended human daily dose of oral azacitidine on a mg / m2 basis ) administered intraperitoneal 3 times per week for 52 weeks .
An increased incidence of tumors in the lymphoreticular system , lung , mammary gland , and skin was seen in mice treated with intraperitoneal azacitidine at 2 mg / kg ( 6 mg / m2 , approximately 3 % of the recommended human daily dose of oral azacitidine on a mg / m2 basis ) once a week for 50 weeks .
A tumorigenicity study in rats dosed twice weekly at 15 or 60 mg / m2 ( approximately 8 % to 32 % of the recommended human daily dose of oral azacitidine on a mg / m2 basis ) revealed an increased incidence of testicular tumors compared with controls .
The mutagenic and clastogenic potential of azacitidine was tested in in vitro bacterial systems Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100 and several strains of trpE8 , Escherichia coli strains WP14 Pro , WP3103P , WP3104P , and CC103 ; in an in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells and human lymphoblast cells ; and in an in vitro micronucleus assay in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells .
Azacitidine was mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cell systems .
The clastogenic effect of azacitidine was shown by the induction of micronuclei in L5178Y mouse cells and Syrian hamster embryo cells .
Administration of azacitidine by intraperitoneal injection to male mice at 9 . 9 mg / m2 ( at doses less than the recommended human daily dose on a mg / m2 basis ) daily for 3 days prior to mating with untreated female mice resulted in decreased fertility and loss of offspring during subsequent embryonic and postnatal development .
Treatment of male rats 3 times per week for 11 or 16 weeks at doses of 15 to 30 mg / m2 ( at doses less than the recommended human daily dose on a mg / m2 basis ) resulted in decreased weight of the testes and epididymides , decreased sperm counts accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates , and increased loss of embryos in mated females .
In a related study , male rats treated for 16 weeks at 24 mg / m2 resulted in an increase in abnormal embryos in mated females when examined on Day 2 of gestation .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of ONUREG was evaluated in QUAZAR ( NCT01757535 ) , a multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study .
Eligible patients were ages 55 years or older , had AML , and were within 4 months of achieving first complete remission ( CR ) or complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery ( CRi ) with intensive induction chemotherapy .
Patients may have received consolidation ( see Table 4 ) .
Patients were excluded if they were candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at the time of screening .
A total of 472 patients who completed induction with or without consolidation therapy were randomized 1 : 1 to receive ONUREG 300 mg ( n = 238 ) or placebo ( n = 234 ) orally on Days 1 through 14 of each 28 - day cycle .
Randomization was stratified by age at time of induction therapy ( 55 to 64 vs . ≥ 65 years ) , cytogenetic risk category at time of induction therapy ( intermediate risk vs . poor risk ) , prior history of MDS / CMML ( yes vs . no ) , and received consolidation therapy following induction therapy ( yes vs . no ) .
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics are shown in Table 4 .
