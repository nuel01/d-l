6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety of nitazoxanide was evaluated in 2177 HIV - uninfected subjects 12 months of age and older who received nitazoxanide tablets or nitazoxanide for oral suspension at the recommended dose for at least three days .
In pooled controlled clinical trials involving 536 HIV - uninfected subjects treated with nitazoxanide tablets or nitazoxanide for oral suspension , the most common adverse reactions were abdominal pain , headache , chromaturia and nausea ( ≥ 2 % ) .
Safety data were analyzed separately for 280 HIV - uninfected subjects ≥ 12 years of age receiving nitazoxanide at the recommended dose for at least three days in 5 placebo - controlled clinical trials and for 256 HIV - uninfected subjects 1 through 11 years of age in 7 controlled clinical trials .
There were no differences between the adverse reactions reported for nitazoxanide - treated subjects based upon age .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of nitazoxanide .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
The following is a list of adverse reactions spontaneously reported with nitazoxanide tablets which were not included in clinical trial listings : Gastrointestinal disorders : diarrhea , gastroesophageal reflux disease Nervous System disorders : dizziness Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders : dyspnea Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : rash , urticaria 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Competition for binding sites may occur when administered concurrently with other highly plasma protein - bound drugs with narrow therapeutic indices .
Monitor for adverse reactions ( 7 ) .
7 . 1 Highly Protein Bound Drugs with Narrow Therapeutic Indices Tizoxanide ( the active metabolite of nitazoxanide ) is highly bound to plasma protein ( > 99 . 9 % ) .
Therefore , monitor for adverse reactions when administering nitazoxanide concurrently with other highly plasma protein - bound drugs with narrow therapeutic indices , as competition for binding sites may occur ( e . g . , warfarin ) .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pediatric Patients : Safety and efficacy of ALINIA for Oral Suspension in pediatric patients less than one year of age has not been studied ( 8 . 4 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no data with nitazoxanide in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk .
No teratogenicity or fetotoxicity was observed in animal reproduction studies with administration of nitazoxanide to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at exposures 30 and 2 times , respectively , the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 500 mg twice daily based on body surface area ( BSA ) .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Nitazoxanide was administered orally to pregnant rats at doses of 0 , 200 , 800 or 3200 mg / kg / day on gestation days 6 to 15 .
Nitazoxanide produced no evidence of systemic maternal toxicity when administered once daily via oral gavage to pregnant female rats at levels up to 3200 mg / kg / day during the period of organogenesis .
In rabbits , nitazoxanide was administered at doses of 0 , 25 , 50 , or 100 mg / kg / day on gestation days 7 to 20 .
Oral treatment of pregnant rabbits with nitazoxanide during organogenesis resulted in minimal maternal toxicity and no external fetal anomalies .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary No information regarding the presence of nitazoxanide in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production is available .
The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for nitazoxanide and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from nitazoxanide or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of ALINIA for Oral Suspension for the treatment of diarrhea caused by G . lamblia or C . parvum in pediatric patients 1 to 11 years of age has been established based on three ( 3 ) randomized , controlled studies with 104 pediatric subjects treated with ALINIA for Oral Suspension 100 mg / 5 mL .
Furthermore , the safety and efficacy of ALINIA for Oral Suspension for the treatment of diarrhea caused by G . lamblia or C . parvum in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age has been established based on two ( 2 ) randomized controlled studies with 44 pediatric subjects treated with ALINIA for Oral Suspension 100 mg / 5 mL .
[ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] The safety and efficacy of nitazoxanide tablets for the treatment of diarrhea caused by G . lamblia or C . parvum in pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age has been established based on three ( 3 ) randomized controlled studies with 47 pediatric subjects treated with nitazoxanide tablets 500 mg .
A single nitazoxanide tablet contains a greater amount of nitazoxanide than is recommended for use in pediatric patients 11 years or younger .
[ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Safety and efficacy of ALINIA for Oral Suspension in pediatric patients less than one year of age has not been studied .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of nitazoxanide tablets and Alinia for oral suspension did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in elderly patients should be considered when prescribing nitazoxanide tablets and Alinia for oral suspension .
8 . 6 Renal and Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of nitazoxanide in patients with compromised renal or hepatic function has not been studied .
8 . 7 HIV - Infected or Immunodeficient Patients Nitazoxanide tablets and Alinia for oral suspension have not been studied for the treatment of diarrhea caused by G . lamblia in HIV - infected or immunodeficient patients .
Nitazoxanide tablets and Alinia for oral suspension have not been shown to be superior to placebo for the treatment of diarrhea caused by C . parvum in HIV - infected or immunodeficient patients [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Limited information on nitazoxanide overdosage is available .
In the event of overdose , gastric lavage may be appropriate soon after oral administration .
Patients should be observed and given symptomatic and supportive treatment .
There is no specific antidote for overdose with nitazoxanide .
Because tizoxanide is highly protein bound ( > 99 . 9 % ) , dialysis is unlikely to significantly reduce plasma concentrations of the drug .

Bioavailability : Nitazoxanide for oral suspension is not bioequivalent to nitazoxanide tablets .
The relative bioavailability of the suspension compared to the tablet was 70 % .
When nitazoxanide tablets are administered with food , the AUCԏ of tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide in plasma is increased almost two - fold and the Cmax is increased by almost 50 % .
When nitazoxanide for oral suspension was administered with food , the AUCԏ of tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide increased by about 45 - 50 % and the Cmax increased by ≤ 10 % .
Nitazoxanide tablets and nitazoxanide for oral suspension were administered with food in clinical trials and hence they are recommended to be administered with food [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Distribution In plasma , more than 99 % of tizoxanide is bound to proteins .
Elimination Metabolism Following oral administration in humans , nitazoxanide is rapidly hydrolyzed to an active metabolite , tizoxanide ( desacetyl - nitazoxanide ) .
Tizoxanide then undergoes conjugation , primarily by glucuronidation .
Excretion Tizoxanide is excreted in the urine , bile and feces , and tizoxanide glucuronide is excreted in urine and bile .
Approximately two - thirds of the oral dose of nitazoxanide is excreted in the feces and one - third in the urine .

Mean ( ± SD ) plasma pharmacokinetic of tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide parameter values following administration of a single dose of ALINIA for Oral suspension with food to subjects ≥ 1 year of age .
Drug Interaction Studies In vitro studies demonstrated that tizoxanide has no significant inhibitory effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action The antiprotozoal activity of nitazoxanide is believed to be due to interference with the pyruvate : ferredoxin oxidoreductase ( PFOR ) enzyme - dependent electron transfer reaction which is essential to anaerobic energy metabolism .
Studies have shown that the PFOR enzyme from G . lamblia directly reduces nitazoxanide by transfer of electrons in the absence of ferredoxin .
The DNA - derived PFOR protein sequence of C . parvum appears to be similar to that of G . lamblia .
Interference with the PFOR enzyme - dependent electron transfer reaction may not be the only pathway by which nitazoxanide exhibits antiprotozoal activity .
Resistance A potential for development of resistance by C . parvum or G . lamblia to nitazoxanide has not been examined .
Antimicrobial Activity Nitazoxanide and its metabolite , tizoxanide , are active in vitro in inhibiting the growth of ( i ) sporozoites and oocysts of C . parvum and ( ii ) trophozoites of G . lamblia .
Susceptibility Test Methods For protozoa such as C . parvum and G . lamblia , standardized tests for use in clinical microbiology laboratories are not available .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment Of Fertility Carcinogenesis Long - term carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted .
Mutagenesis Nitazoxanide was not genotoxic in the Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell chromosomal aberration assay or the mouse micronucleus assay .
Nitazoxanide was genotoxic in one tester strain ( TA 100 ) in the Ames bacterial mutation assay .
Impairment of Fertility Nitazoxanide did not adversely affect male or female fertility in the rat at 2400 mg / kg / day ( approximately 20 times the clinical adult dose adjusted for body surface area ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Diarrhea Caused by G . lamblia Diarrhea caused by G . lamblia in adults and adolescents 12 years of age or older : In a double - blind , controlled trial ( Study 1 ) conducted in Peru and Egypt in adults and adolescents with diarrhea and with one or more enteric symptoms ( e . g . , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , fever , abdominal distention , loss of appetite , flatulence ) caused by G . lamblia , a three - day course of treatment with nitazoxanide tablets administered 500 mg twice daily was compared with a placebo tablet for 3 days .
