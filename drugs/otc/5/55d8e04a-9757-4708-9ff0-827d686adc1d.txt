2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Loading Dose : 20 mg IV administered over 30 minutes ( 2 . 1 ) , followed by : • Continuous infusion : 20 mg / day over 24 hours , for 2 to 4 days ( 2 . 1 ) .
• Following initial day of treatment , dosage may be increased to 40 mg / day continuous infusion as needed to raise serum sodium ( 2 . 1 ) .
• Monitor volume status and serum sodium frequently and discontinue if patient develops hypovolemia , hypotension or undesirable rapid rate of increase in serum sodium ( 2 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) .
• Hepatic impairment : Decrease the dose in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment ( 8 . 6 , 12 . 3 ) .
2 . 1 General Dosing Information VAPRISOL is for intravenous use only .
VAPRISOL is for use in hospitalized patients only .
Administer VAPRISOL through large veins and change of the infusion site every 24 hours to minimize the risk of vascular irritation [ see Warnings and Precaution ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Initiate with a loading dose of 20 mg VAPRISOL administered intravenously over 30 minutes .
Follow the loading dose with 20 mg VAPRISOL administered in a continuous intravenous infusion over 24 hours .
After the initial day of treatment , administer VAPRISOL for an additional 1 to 3 days in a continuous infusion of 20 mg / day .
If serum sodium is not rising at the desired rate , VAPRISOL may be titrated upward to a maximum dose of 40 mg daily , administered in a continuous intravenous infusion over 24 hours .
The total duration of infusion of VAPRISOL ( after the loading dose ) should not exceed four days .
Patients receiving VAPRISOL must have frequent monitoring of serum sodium and volume status [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 2 Preparation , Compatibility and Stability Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
If particulate matter , discoloration or cloudiness is observed , the drug solution should not be used .
VAPRISOL is supplied ready - to - use ; no further dilution of this preparation is necessary .
VAPRISOL is compatible with 5 % Dextrose Injection .
VAPRISOL is physically and chemically compatible with 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection for up to 48 hours when the two solutions are co - administered via a Y - site connection at a flow rate for VAPRISOL of 4 . 2 mL / hour and at flow rates for 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection of either 2 . 1 mL / hour or 6 . 3 mL / hour .
VAPRISOL is incompatible with both Lactated Ringer ' s Injection and furosemide injection when these products are mixed in the same container ; therefore , do not combine VAPRISOL with these products in the same intravenous line or container .
Do not combine VAPRISOL with any other product in the same intravenous line or container .
Do not use plastic containers in series connections .
Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is completed .
Do not remove container from overwrap until ready for use .
The overwrap is a moisture and light barrier .
The inner container maintains the sterility of the product .
Tear overwrap down side at slit and remove solution container .
Some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed .
This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety .
The opacity will diminish gradually .
After removing overwrap , check for minute leaks by squeezing inner container firmly .
If leaks are found , discard solution as sterility may be impaired .
Do not use if the solution is cloudy or a precipitate is present .
Preparation for Administration : • Suspend container from eyelet support .
• Remove protector from outlet port at bottom of container .
• Attach administration set .
Refer to complete directions accompanying set .
2 . 3 Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate ( Child - Pugh Class B ) and severe ( Child - Pugh Class C ) hepatic impairment , initiate VAPRISOL with a loading dose of 10 mg over 30 minutes followed by 10 mg per day as a continuous infusion for 2 to 4 days .
If serum sodium is not rising at the desired rate , VAPRISOL may be titrated upward to 20 mg per day [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

4 . 3 Anuric Patients In patients unable to make urine , no benefit can be expected [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Hypervolemic hyponatremia associated with heart failure : Data are limited .
Consider other treatment options ( 5 . 1 , 6 . 1 ) .
• Overly rapid correction of serum sodium : Monitor serum sodium and neurologic status as serious neurologic sequelae can result from over rapid correction of serum sodium ( 2 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) .
• Infusion site reactions : Serious reactions have occurred .
Administer through large veins and change infusion site every 24 hours ( 2 . 1 , 5 . 4 , 6 ) .
5 . 1 Hyponatremia Associated with Heart Failure The amount of safety data on the use of VAPRISOL in patients with hypervolemic hyponatremia associated with heart failure is limited .
VAPRISOL should be used to raise serum sodium in such patients only after consideration of other treatment options [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 2 Overly Rapid Correction of Serum Sodium Osmotic demyelination syndrome is a risk associated with overly rapid correction of hyponatremia ( i . e . , > 12 mEq / L / 24 hours ) .
Osmotic demyelination results in dysarthria , mutism , dysphagia , lethargy , affective changes , spastic quadriparesis , seizures , coma or death .
In susceptible patients , including those with severe malnutrition , alcoholism or advanced liver disease , use slower rates of correction .
In controlled clinical trials of VAPRISOL , about 9 % of patients who received VAPRISOL in doses of 20 - 40 mg / day IV had rises of serum sodium > 12 mEq / L / 24 hours , but none of these patients had evidence of osmotic demyelination or permanent neurologic sequelae .
Serum sodium concentration and neurologic status should be monitored appropriately during VAPRISOL administration , and VAPRISOL administration should be discontinued if the patient develops an undesirably rapid rate of rise of serum sodium .
If the serum sodium concentration continues to rise , VAPRISOL should not be resumed .
If hyponatremia persists or recurs ( after initial discontinuation of VAPRISOL for an undesirably rapid rate of rise of serum sodium concentration ) , and the patient has had no evidence of neurologic sequelae of rapid rise in serum sodium , VAPRISOL may be resumed at a reduced dose [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 3 Hypovolemia or Hypotension For patients who develop hypovolemia or hypotension while receiving VAPRISOL , VAPRISOL should be discontinued , and volume status and vital signs should be frequently monitored .
Once the patient is again euvolemic and is no longer hypotensive , VAPRISOL may be resumed at a reduced dose if the patient remains hyponatremic .
5 . 4 Infusion Site Reactions Infusion site reactions are common and can include serious reactions , even with proper infusion rates [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Administer VAPRISOL via large veins , and rotate the infusion site every 24 hours [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in labeling : • Osmotic demyelination syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Infusion site reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 10 % ) are infusion site reactions ( including phlebitis ) , pyrexia , hypokalemia , headache and orthostatic hypotension ( 6 ) .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reactions rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The adverse event information from clinical trials does , however , provide a basis for identifying the adverse events that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates .
The most common adverse reactions reported with VAPRISOL administration were infusion site reactions .
In studies in patients and healthy volunteers , infusion site reactions occurred in 73 % and 63 % of subjects treated with VAPRISOL 20 mg / day and 40 mg / day , respectively , compared to 4 % in the placebo group .
Infusion site reactions were the most common type of adverse event leading to discontinuation of VAPRISOL .
Discontinuations from treatment due to infusion site reactions were more common among VAPRISOL - treated patients ( 3 % ) than among placebo - treated patients ( 0 % ) .
Some serious infusion site reactions did occur [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
The adverse reactions presented in Table 1 are derived from 72 healthy volunteers and 243 patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia who received VAPRISOL 20 mg IV as a loading dose followed by 40 mg / day IV for 2 to 4 days , from 37 patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia who received VAPRISOL 20 mg IV as a loading dose followed by 20 mg / day IV for 2 to 4 days in an open - label study , and from 40 healthy volunteers and 29 patients with euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia who received placebo .
The adverse reactions occurred in at least 5 % of patients treated with VAPRISOL and at a higher incidence for VAPRISOL - treated patients than for placebo - treated patients .

The maximum recommended daily dose of VAPRISOL ( after the loading dose ) is 40 mg / day .
Heart failure with hypervolemic hyponatremia In clinical trials where VAPRISOL was administered to 79 hypervolemic hyponatremic patients with underlying heart failure and intravenous placebo administered to 10 patients , adverse cardiac failure events , atrial dysrhythmias , and sepsis occurred more frequently among patients treated with VAPRISOL ( 32 % , 5 % and 8 % respectively ) than among patients treated with placebo ( 20 % , 0 % and 0 % respectively ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Potent CYP3A inhibitors may increase the exposure of conivaptan and are contraindicated ( 4 . 2 , 7 . 1 ) .
• Generally avoid CYP3A substrates ( 5 . 3 , 7 . 1 ) .
• Exposure to coadministered digoxin may be increased and digoxin levels should be monitored ( 7 . 2 ) .
7 . 1 CYP3A Inhibitors and Substrates Conivaptan is a sensitive substrate of CYP3A .
Coadministration with strong CYP3A inhibitors ( e . g . ketoconazole , itraconazole , clarithromycin , ritonavir and indinavir ) increases conivaptan exposure and is contraindicated [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Coadministration with CYP3A substrates results in increased exposure of the other drug .
Avoid concomitant use with drugs eliminated primarily by CYP3A - mediated metabolism .
Subsequent treatment with CYP3A substrates may be initiated no sooner than 1 week after the infusion of VAPRISOL is completed [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Digoxin Coadministration of digoxin with oral conivaptan resulted in a 1 . 8 - and 1 . 4 - fold increase in digoxin Cmax and AUC , respectively .
Monitor digoxin levels .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended ( 8 . 2 ) .
• Pediatric Use : There are no studies ( 8 . 4 ) .
• Severe renal impairment : VAPRISOL is not recommended ( 8 . 7 , 12 . 3 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with VAPRISOL in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major malformations and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % , and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data When pregnant rats were given intravenous conivaptan hydrochloride up to 2 . 5 mg / kg / day on gestation days 7 through 17 ( systemic exposures less than human therapeutic exposure based on AUC comparisons ) , no significant fetal or maternal effects were noted .
However , when the same doses were administered to pregnant rats from gestation day 7 through lactation day 20 ( weaning ) , the pups showed decreased neonatal viability and weaning indices , decreased body weight , and delayed reflex and physical development ( including sexual maturation ) .
These effects occurred only at the highest dose administered ( 2 . 5 mg / kg / day ) .
No maternal adverse effects of conivaptan were seen in this study .
When pregnant rabbits were administered intravenous doses of conivaptan hydrochloride up to 12 mg / kg / day on gestation days 6 through 18 ( at about twice the human therapeutic exposure ) , there were no fetal or maternal findings .
Rat fetal tissue levels were < 10 % of maternal plasma concentrations while placental levels were 2 . 2 - fold higher than maternal plasma concentrations .
Conivaptan that is taken up by fetal tissue is slowly cleared , suggesting that fetal accumulation is possible .
Conivaptan hydrochloride delayed delivery in rats dosed at 10 mg / kg / day by oral gavage ( systemic exposure equivalent to the human therapeutic exposure based on AUC comparison ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding conivaptan or its metabolites in human milk , the effects of conivaptan on the breastfed infant , or the effects of conivaptan on milk production .
Conivaptan is present in rat milk ; however , due to species - specific differences in lactation physiology , the clinical relevance of these data are not clear [ see Data ] .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions , including electrolyte abnormalities ( e . g . , hypernatremia ) , hypotension , and volume depletion in breastfed infants , advise a woman not to breastfeed during treatment with VAPRISOL .
Data Milk levels of conivaptan in rats reached maximal levels at 1 hour following intravenous administration and were up to 3 times maternal plasma levels following an intravenous dose of 1 mg / kg ( systemic exposure less than human therapeutic exposure based on AUC comparison ) .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Females Based on findings of decreased fertility in female rats , conivaptan may impair fertility in females of reproductive potential .
It is not known whether these effects on fertility are reversible [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In clinical studies of VAPRISOL administered as a 20 mg IV loading dose followed by 20 mg / day or 40 mg / day IV for 2 to 4 days , 89 % ( 20 mg / day regimen ) and 60 % ( 40 mg / day regimen ) of participants were greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 60 % ( 20 mg / day regimen ) and 40 % ( 40 mg / day regimen ) were greater than or equal to 75 years of age .
In general , the adverse event profile in elderly patients was similar to that seen in the general study population .
8 . 6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No clinically relevant increase in exposure was observed in subjects with mild hepatic impairment ; therefore no dose adjustment of VAPRISOL is necessary .
The systemic exposure to unbound conivaptan doubled in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No clinically relevant increase in exposure was observed in subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment ( CLcr 30 – 80 mL / min ) .
No dose adjustment of VAPRISOL is necessary .
Because of the high incidence of infusion site phlebitis ( which can reduce vascular access sites ) and unlikely benefit , use in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) is not recommended [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Although no data on overdosage in humans are available , VAPRISOL has been administered as a 20 mg loading dose on Day 1 followed by continuous infusion of 80 mg / day for 4 days in hyponatremia patients and up to 120 mg / day for 2 days in CHF patients .
No new toxicities were identified at these higher doses , but adverse events related to the pharmacologic activity of VAPRISOL , e . g . hypotension and thirst , occurred more frequently at these higher doses .
In case of overdose , based on expected exaggerated pharmacological activity , symptomatic treatment with frequent monitoring of vital signs and close observation of the patient is recommended .
11 DESCRIPTION Conivaptan hydrochloride is chemically [ 1 , 1 ' - biphenyl ] - 2 - carboxamide , N - [ 4 - [ ( 4 , 5 - dihydro - 2 - methylimidazo [ 4 , 5 - d ] [ 1 ] benzazepin - 6 ( 1 H ) - yl ) carbonyl ] phenyl ] - , monohydrochloride , having a molecular weight of 535 . 04 and molecular formula C32H26N4O2 ∙ HCl .
The structural formula of conivaptan hydrochloride is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Conivaptan hydrochloride is a white to off - white or pale orange - white powder that is very slightly soluble in water ( 0 . 15 mg / mL at 23 ° C ) .
Conivaptan hydrochloride injection is supplied as a sterile premixed solution with dextrose in a flexible plastic container .
Each container contains a clear , colorless , sterile , non - pyrogenic solution of conivaptan hydrochloride in dextrose injection for intravenous use .
Each 100 mL , single - use premixed INTRAVIA Container contains 20 mg of conivaptan hydrochloride and 5 g of Dextrose Hydrous , USP .
Lactic Acid , USP is added for pH adjustment to pH 3 . 4 to 3 . 8 .
The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially designed multilayer plastic ( PL 2408 ) .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container leach out certain of the chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts ; however , biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials .
The flexible container has a foil overwrap .
Water can permeate the plastic into the overwrap , but the amount is insufficient to affect the premixed solution significantly .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Conivaptan hydrochloride is a dual arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) antagonist with nanomolar affinity for human V1A and V2 receptors in vitro .
The level of AVP in circulating blood is critical for the regulation of water and electrolyte balance and is usually elevated in both euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia .
The AVP effect is mediated through V2 receptors , which are functionally coupled to aquaporin channels in the apical membrane of the collecting ducts of the kidney .
These receptors help to maintain plasma osmolality within the normal range .
The predominant pharmacodynamic effect of conivaptan hydrochloride in the treatment of hyponatremia is through its V2 antagonism of AVP in the renal collecting ducts , an effect that results in aquaresis , or excretion of free water .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The pharmacodynamic effects of conivaptan hydrochloride include increased free water excretion ( i . e . , effective water clearance [ EWC ] ) generally accompanied by increased net fluid loss , increased urine output , and decreased urine osmolality .
Studies in animal models of hyponatremia showed that conivaptan hydrochloride prevented the occurrence of hyponatremia - related physical signs in rats with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion .
Electrophysiology The effect of VAPRISOL 40 mg IV and 80 mg IV on the QT interval was evaluated after the first dose ( Day 1 ) and at the last day during treatment ( Day 4 ) in a randomized , single - blind , parallel group , placebo - and positive - controlled ( moxifloxacin 400 mg IV ) study in healthy male and female volunteers aged 18 to 45 years .
Digital ECGs were obtained at baseline and on Days 1 and 4 .
Moxifloxacin elicited placebo - corrected changes from baseline in individualized QT correction ( QTcI ) of + 7 to + 10 msec on Days 1 and 4 , respectively , indicating that the study had assay sensitivity .
The placebo - corrected changes from baseline in QTcI in the VAPRISOL 40 mg and 80 mg dose groups on Day 1 were - 3 . 5 msec and - 2 . 9 msec , respectively , and - 2 . 1 msec for both dose groups on Day 4 .
The results suggest that conivaptan has no clinically significant effect on cardiac repolarization .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of conivaptan have been characterized in healthy subjects , specific populations and patients following both oral and intravenous dosing regimens .
The pharmacokinetics of conivaptan following intravenous infusion ( 40 mg / day to 80 mg / day ) and oral administration are non - linear , and inhibition by conivaptan of its own metabolism seems to be the major factor for the non - linearity .
The intersubject variability of conivaptan pharmacokinetics is high ( 94 % CV in CL ) .
The pharmacokinetics of conivaptan and its metabolites were characterized in healthy male subjects administered conivaptan hydrochloride as a 20 mg loading dose ( infused over 30 minutes ) followed by a continuous infusion of 40 mg / day for 3 days .
Mean Cmax for conivaptan was 619 ng / mL and occurred at the end of the loading dose .
Plasma concentrations reached a minimum at approximately 12 hours after start of the loading dose , then gradually increased over the duration of the infusion to a mean concentration of 188 ng / mL at the end of the infusion .
The mean terminal elimination half - life after conivaptan infusion was 5 . 0 hours , and the mean clearance was 253 . 3 mL / min .
In an open - label safety and efficacy study , the pharmacokinetics of conivaptan were characterized in hypervolemic or euvolemic hyponatremia patients ( ages 20 - 92 years ) receiving conivaptan hydrochloride as a 20 mg loading dose ( infused over 30 minutes ) followed by a continuous infusion of 20 or 40 mg / day for 4 days .
The median - plasma conivaptan concentrations are shown in Figure 1 .
The median ( range ) elimination half - life was 5 . 3 ( 3 . 3 - 9 . 3 ) or 8 . 1 ( 4 . 1 - 22 . 5 ) hours in the 20 mg / day or 40 mg / day group , respectively , based on data from rich PK sampling .
Figure 1 .
Median Plasma Concentration - Time Profiles from Rich PK Sampling Post 20 mg Loading Dose and 20 mg / day ( open circle ) or 40 mg / day ( closed circle ) Infusion for 4 Days [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Distribution Conivaptan is extensively bound to human plasma proteins , being 99 % bound over the concentration range of approximately 10 to 1000 ng / mL .
Metabolism and Excretion CYP3A was identified as the sole cytochrome P450 isozyme responsible for the metabolism of conivaptan .
Four metabolites have been identified .
The pharmacological activity of the metabolites at V1A and V2 receptors ranged from approximately 3 - 50 % and 50 - 100 % that of conivaptan , respectively .
The combined exposure of the metabolites following intravenous administration of conivaptan is approximately 7 % that of conivaptan and hence , their contribution to the clinical effect of conivaptan is minimal .
After intravenous ( 10 mg ) or oral ( 20 mg ) administration of conivaptan hydrochloride in a mass balance study , approximately 83 % of the dose was excreted in feces as total radioactivity and 12 % in urine over several days of collection .
Over the first 24 hours after dosing , approximately 1 % of the intravenous dose was excreted in urine as intact conivaptan .
Specific Populations Hepatic Impairment In subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment , the area under the plasma concentration - time curve for unbound conivaptan was 2 . 3 - to 2 . 5 - fold the values observed in normal volunteers .
The plasma protein binding of conivaptan decreased approximately 27 % and 50 % , respectively in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment .
No clinically relevant increase in systemic exposure was observed in subjects with mild hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Renal Impairment Mild and moderate renal impairment ( CLcr 30 – 80 mL / min ) do not affect exposure to VAPRISOL to a clinically relevant extent .
Use in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min ) is not recommended [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Drug Interactions CYP3A Conivaptan is a sensitive substrate of CYP3A .
The effect of ketoconazole , a potent CYP3A inhibitor , on the pharmacokinetics of intravenous conivaptan has not been evaluated .
Coadministration of oral conivaptan hydrochloride 10 mg with ketoconazole 200 mg resulted in Cmax and AUC of conivaptan 4 - and 11 - fold , respectively , levels with conivaptan alone [ see Contraindications ( 4 . 2 ) Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Conivaptan is a potent mechanism - based inhibitor of CYP3A .
The effect of conivaptan on the pharmacokinetics of co - administered CYP3A substrates has been evaluated with the coadministration of conivaptan with midazolam , simvastatin , and amlodipine .
VAPRISOL 40 mg / day increased the mean AUC values by approximately 100 % - for 1 mg intravenous or by 200 % for 2 mg oral doses of midazolam .
VAPRISOL 30 mg / day tripled the AUC of simvastatin .
Oral conivaptan hydrochloride 40 mg twice daily doubled the AUC and half - life of amlodipine .
Digoxin Coadministration of a 0 . 5 mg dose of digoxin , a P - glycoprotein substrate , with oral conivaptan hydrochloride 40 mg twice daily resulted in a 30 % reduction in clearance and 79 % and 43 % increases in digoxin Cmax and AUC values , respectively [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
Warfarin VAPRISOL ( 40 mg / day for 4 days ) administered with a single 25 mg dose of warfarin , which undergoes major metabolism by CYP2C9 and minor metabolism by CYP3A , increased the mean S - warfarin AUC and S - warfarin Cmax by 14 % and 17 % , respectively .
The corresponding prothrombin time and international normalized ratio values were unchanged .
Captopril and Furosemide The pharmacokinetics of oral conivaptan ( 20 - 40 mg / day ) were unchanged with coadministration of either captopril 25 mg or furosemide up to 80 mg / day .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Standard lifetime ( 104 week ) carcinogenicity bioassays were conducted in mice and rats .
Male and female mice were given oral doses of conivaptan hydrochloride up to 30 mg / kg / day and 10 mg / kg / day , respectively , by gavage .
Male and female rats were given oral doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day and 30 mg / kg / day , respectively , by gavage .
There was no increased incidence of tumors associated with exposure to conivaptan in either species .
The 30 mg / kg / day dosage regimen in male mice and female rats was shown to result in a systemic exposure ( AUC ) about twice the human systemic exposure from an IV bolus of 20 mg on day 1 followed by IV infusion of 40 mg / day for 3 days .
The 10 mg / kg / day dosage regimen in female mice and male rats was shown to result in about one - fourth and one - half the human therapeutic exposure , respectively .
Conivaptan was not genotoxic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay , the in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosomal aberration assay , or in vivo rat micronucleus assay .
Fertility of male rats treated with conivaptan hydrochloride by IV bolus doses of up to 2 . 5 mg / kg / day for the 4 weeks preceding mating and throughout the mating period was unaffected .
However , when female rats were given IV bolus conivaptan from 15 days before mating through gestation day 7 , there was prolonged diestrus , decreased fertility ( decreased numbers of corpora lutea and implantations ) and increased post - implantation loss at 2 . 5 mg / kg / day ( systemic exposure less than human exposure at the therapeutic dose ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Hyponatremia The effect on serum sodium of VAPRISOL was demonstrated in a double - blind , placebo - controlled , randomized , multicenter study conducted in 84 patients with euvolemic ( N = 56 ) or hypervolemic ( N = 28 ) hyponatremia ( serum sodium 115 - 130 mEq / L ) from a variety of underlying causes ( malignant or nonmalignant diseases of the central nervous system , lung , or abdomen ; congestive heart failure ; hypertension ; myocardial infarction ; diabetes ; osteoarthritis ; or idiopathic ) .
Study participants were randomized to receive either placebo IV ( N = 29 ) , VAPRISOL 40 mg / day IV ( N = 29 ) , or VAPRISOL 80 mg / day IV ( N = 26 ) .
Daily fluid intake was restricted to 2 liters .
VAPRISOL or placebo was administered as a continuous infusion following a 30 minute IV loading dose on the first treatment day and patients were treated for 4 days .
Serum or plasma sodium concentrations were assessed pre - dose ( Hour 0 ) and at 4 , 6 , 10 , and 24 hours post - dose on all treatment days .
Mean serum sodium concentration was 123 . 3 mEq / L at study entry .
The mean change in serum sodium concentration from baseline over the 4 - day treatment period is shown in Figure 2 .
Figure 2 .
Mean ( SE ) Change from Baseline in Sodium Concentrations with VAPRISOL 40 mg / day [ MULTIMEDIA ] Following treatment with 40 mg / day of VAPRISOL , the mean change from baseline in serum sodium concentration at the end of 2 days of treatment with VAPRISOL was 5 . 3 mEq / L ( mean concentration 128 . 6 mEq / L ) .
At the end of the 4 - day treatment period , the mean change from baseline was 6 . 5 mEq / L ( mean concentration 129 . 8 mEq / L ) .
In addition , after 2 days and 4 days of treatment with VAPRISOL , 41 % ( after 2 days ) and 69 % ( after 4 days ) of patients achieved a ≥ 6 mEq / L increase in serum sodium concentration or a normal serum sodium of ≥ 135 mEq / L .
Although 80 mg / day was also studied , it was not significantly more effective than 40 mg / day and was associated with a higher incidence of infusion site reactions and a higher rate of discontinuations for adverse events [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Additional efficacy data are summarized in Table 2 .

In 10 Phase 2 / pilot heart failure studies , VAPRISOL did not show statistically significant improvement for heart failure outcomes , including such measures as length of hospital stay , changes in categorized physical findings of heart failure , change in ejection fraction , change in exercise tolerance , change in functional status , or change in heart failure symptoms , compared to placebo .
In these studies , the changes in the physical findings and heart failure symptoms were no worse in the VAPRISOL - treated group ( N = 818 ) compared to the placebo group ( N = 290 ) [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
