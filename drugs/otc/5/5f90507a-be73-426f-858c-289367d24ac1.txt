WARNING : COMPLEX SLEEP BEHAVIORS See full prescribing information for complete box warning .
Complex sleep behaviors including sleep - walking , sleep - driving , and engaging in other activities while not fully awake may occur following use of zolpidem tartrate .
Some of these events may result in serious injuries , including death .
Discontinue zolpidem tartrate immediately if a patient experiences a complex sleep behavior ( 4 , 5 . 1 ) .
1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablets are indicated for use as needed for the treatment of insomnia when a middle - of - the - night awakening is followed by difficulty returning to sleep .
Limitations of Use : Zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablets are not indicated for the treatment of middle - of - the - night insomnia when the patient has fewer than 4 hours of bedtime remaining before the planned time of waking .
Zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablets are a GABAA agonist indicated for use as needed for the treatment of insomnia when a middle - of - the - night awakening is followed by difficulty returning to sleep ( 1 ) Limitation of Use : Not indicated for the treatment of middle - of - the night awakening when the patient has fewer than 4 hours of bedtime remaining before the planned time of waking ( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Take only if 4 hours of bedtime remain before the planned time of waking ( 2 . 1 , 5 . 1 ) • Zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablets should be placed under the tongue and allowed to disintegrate completely before swallowing .
The tablet should not be swallowed whole .
( 2 . 1 ) • The effect of zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablets may be slowed if taken with or immediately after a meal ( 2 . 1 ) • Recommended dose is 1 . 75 mg for women and 3 . 5 mg for men , taken only once per night if needed ( 2 . 2 ) • Lower doses of CNS depressants may be necessary when taken concomitantly with zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablets ( 2 . 3 ) • Co - administration with CNS depressants : Recommended dose is 1 . 75 mg for men and women ( 2 . 3 ) • Geriatric patients and patients with hepatic impairment : Recommended dose is 1 . 75 mg for men and women ( 2 . 4 , 2 . 5 ) 2 . 1 Important Administration Instructions Zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablets are to be taken in bed when a patient wakes in the middle of the night and has difficulty returning to sleep .
Zolpidem Tartrate Sublingual Tablets should only be taken if the patient has at least 4 hours of bedtime remaining before the planned time of waking [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablets should be placed under the tongue and allowed to disintegrate completely before swallowing .
The tablet should not be swallowed whole .
For optimal effect , zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablets should not be administered with or immediately after a meal .
The tablet should be removed from the pouch just prior to dosing .
2 . 2 Basic Dosing Information The recommended and maximum dose of zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablets are 1 . 75 mg for women and 3 . 5 mg for men , taken only once per night as needed if a middle - of - the - night awakening is followed by difficulty returning to sleep .
The recommended doses for women and men are different because women clear zolpidem from the body at a lower rate than men [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
2 . 3 Use with CNS Depressants The recommended zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablets dose for men and women who are taking concomitant CNS depressants is 1 . 75 mg .
Dose adjustment of concomitant CNS depressants may be necessary when co - administered with zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablets because of potentially additive effects .
The use of zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablets with other sedative - hypnotics ( including other zolpidem products ) at bedtime or the middle of the night is not recommended [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 4 Use in Geriatric Patients Geriatric patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of zolpidem .
The recommended dose of zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablets in men and women over 65 years old is 1 . 75 mg , taken only once per night if needed [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
2 . 5 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The recommended dose of zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablets in patients with hepatic impairment is 1 . 75 mg , taken only once per night if needed [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Zolpidem tartrate is available as 1 . 75 mg and 3 . 5 mg tablets for sublingual administration .

1 . 75 mg and 3 . 5 mg sublingual tablets ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Zolpidem tartrate is contraindicated in patients who have experienced complex sleep behaviors after taking zolpidem tartrate [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Zolpidem tartrate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to zolpidem .
Observed reactions with zolpidem include anaphylaxis and angioedema [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
• Patients who have experienced complex sleep behaviors after taking zolpidem tartrate ( 4 , 5 . 1 ) • Known hypersensitivity to zolpidem ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • CNS depressant effects : Impairs alertness and motor coordination , including risk of morning impairment .
Risk increases with dose and use with other CNS depressants and alcohol .
Instruct patients on correct use ( 5 . 2 ) • Evaluate for co - morbid diagnoses : Re - evaluate if insomnia persists after 7 to 10 days of use ( 5 . 2 ) • Severe anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions : Angioedema and anaphylaxis have been reported .
Do not re - challenge if such reactions occur ( 5 . 3 ) • Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes : Changes including decreased inhibition , bizarre behavior , agitation and depersonalization have been reported .
Immediately evaluate any new onset behavioral changes ( 5 . 5 ) • Depression : Worsening of depression or suicidal thinking may occur .
Prescribe the least number of tablets feasible to avoid intentional overdose ( 5 . 6 ) • Respiratory Depression : Consider this risk before prescribing in patients with compromised respiratory function ( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Complex Sleep Behaviors Complex sleep behaviors including sleep - walking , sleep - driving , and engaging in other activities while not fully awake may occur following the first or any subsequent use of zolpidem .
Patients can be seriously injured or injure others during complex sleep behaviors .
Such injuries may result in a fatal outcome .
Other complex sleep behaviors ( e . g . , preparing and eating food , making phone calls , or having sex ) have also been reported .
Patients usually do not remember these events .
Post - marketing reports have shown that complex sleep behaviors may occur with zolpidem alone at recommended dosages , with or without the concomitant use of alcohol or other central nervous system ( CNS ) depressants [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Discontinue zolpidem tartrate immediately if a patient experiences a complex sleep behavior .
5 . 2 CNS Depressant Effects and Next - Day Impairment Zolpidem tartrate , like other sedative - hypnotic drugs , has CNS depressant effects .
Co - administration with other CNS depressants ( e . g . , benzodiazepines , opioids , tricyclic antidepressants , alcohol ) increases the risk of CNS depression .
Dosage adjustments of zolpidem tartrate and of other concomitant CNS depressants may be necessary when zolpidem tartrate is administered with such agents because of the potentially additive effects .
The use of zolpidem tartrate with other sedative - hypnotics ( including other zolpidem products ) at bedtime or the middle of the night is not recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
In a driving study , healthy subjects who received zolpidem tartrate with fewer than four hours of bedtime remaining had evidence of impaired driving compared to subjects who received placebo [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The risk of next - day driving impairment ( and psychomotor impairment ) is increased if zolpidem tartrate is taken with less than 4 hours of bedtime remaining , if higher than recommended dose is taken , if co - administered with other CNS depressants , or co - administered with other drugs that increase the blood levels of zolpidem .
Because zolpidem tartrate can cause drowsiness and a decreased level of consciousness , patients , particularly the elderly , are at a higher risk of falls .
5 . 3 Need to Evaluate for Co - Morbid Diagnoses Because sleep disturbances may be the presenting manifestation of a physical and / or psychiatric disorder , symptomatic treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after a careful evaluation of the patient .
The failure of insomnia to remit after 7 to 10 days of treatment may indicate the presence of a primary psychiatric and / or medical illness that should be evaluated .
Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new thinking or behavior abnormalities may be the consequence of an unrecognized psychiatric or physical disorder .
Such findings have emerged during the course of treatment with sedative - hypnotic drugs , including zolpidem .
5 . 4 Severe Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid Reactions Cases of angioedema involving the tongue , glottis , or larynx have been reported in patients after taking the first or subsequent doses of zolpidem .
Some patients have had additional symptoms such as dyspnea , throat closing , or nausea and vomiting that suggest anaphylaxis .
Some patients have required medical therapy in the emergency department .
If angioedema involves the throat , glottis or larynx , airway obstruction may occur and be fatal .
Patients who develop angioedema or anaphylaxis after treatment with zolpidem should not be rechallenged with zolpidem tartrate .
5 . 5 Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes Abnormal thinking and behavior changes have been reported in patients treated with sedative - hypnotics including zolpidem .
Some of these changes included decreased inhibition ( e . g . , aggressiveness and extroversion that seemed out of character ) , bizarre behavior , agitation , and depersonalization .
Visual and auditory hallucinations have also been reported .
In controlled trials of zolpidem tartrate 10 mg taken at bedtime , < 1 % of adults with insomnia who received zolpidem reported hallucinations .
In a clinical trial , 7 % of pediatric patients treated with zolpidem tartrate 0 . 25 mg / kg taken at bedtime , reported hallucinations , versus 0 % treated with placebo [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
The emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation .
5 . 6 Use in Patients with Depression In primarily depressed patients treated with sedative - hypnotics , worsening of depression , and suicidal thoughts and actions ( including completed suicides ) , have been reported .
Suicidal tendencies may be present in such patients and protective measures may be required .
Intentional overdosage is more common in this group of patients ; therefore , the lowest number of tablets that is feasible should be prescribed for the patient at any one time .
5 . 7 Respiratory Depression Although studies with 10 mg zolpidem tartrate did not reveal respiratory depressant effects at hypnotic doses in healthy subjects or in patients with mild - to - moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , a reduction in the Total Arousal Index , together with a reduction in lowest oxygen saturation and increase in the times of oxygen desaturation below 80 % and 90 % , was observed in patients with mild - to - moderate sleep apnea when treated with zolpidem compared to placebo .
Since sedative - hypnotics have the capacity to depress respiratory drive , precautions should be taken if zolpidem tartrate is prescribed to patients with compromised respiratory function .
Post - marketing reports of respiratory insufficiency in patients receiving 10 mg of zolpidem tartrate , most of whom had pre - existing respiratory impairment , have been reported .
The risks of respiratory depression should be considered prior to prescribing zolpidem tartrate in patients with respiratory impairment including sleep apnea and myasthenia gravis .
5 . 8 Withdrawal Effects There have been reports of withdrawal signs and symptoms following the rapid dose decrease or abrupt discontinuation of zolpidem .
Monitor patients for tolerance , abuse , and dependence [ see Drug Abuse and Dependence ( 9 . 2 ) and ( 9 . 3 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions in zolpidem - treated patients are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling : • Complex Sleep Behaviors [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • CNS - Depressant Effects and Next - Day Impairment [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Serious Anaphylactic and Anaphylactoid Reactions [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Abnormal Thinking and Behavioral Changes [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] • Withdrawal Effects [ See Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] Most commonly observed adverse reactions ( > 1 % in adult patients ) are headache , nausea , and fatigue .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience The safety data described below are based on two double - blind placebo - controlled trials of zolpidem tartrate in adult patients with insomnia characterized by difficulty returning to sleep after a middle - of - the - night awakening [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
These two trials included 230 and 82 patients treated with 3 . 5 mg and 1 . 75 mg of zolpidem tartrate , respectively .
The first study was a 3 - way crossover sleep - laboratory study in 82 patients ( 58 female and 24 male ; median age 47 years ; 51 % Caucasian , 44 % African - American ) of 1 . 75 mg and 3 . 5 mg of zolpidem tartrate compared to placebo ( Study 1 ) .
The second study was a 4 - week , parallel - group at - home study in 295 patients ( 201 female and 94 male ; median age 43 years ) of 3 . 5 mg of zolpidem tartrate compared to placebo , used on an as - needed basis after spontaneous middle - of - the - night awakenings ( Study 2 ) .
In Study 2 , patients took zolpidem tartrate during the night on 62 % of study nights .
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in actual practice .
Table 1 shows the incidence of adverse reactions reported in Study 2 that occurred in 2 % or more of zolpidem tartrate - treated ( 3 . 5 mg ) patients in which the incidence was greater than the incidence in placebo - treated patients .
For women and other patients taking the 1 . 75 mg dose in Study 1 , the incidence of adverse reactions was similar to the incidence seen with 3 . 5 mg of zolpidem tartrate inTable 1 .
The most commonly reported adverse reactions in all treatment groups were headache , nausea , and fatigue .
Table 1 : Summary of Adverse Reactions ( ≥ 2 % ) in Outpatient , Double - Blind , Parallel - Group , Placebo - Controlled Study ( Study 2 ) MedDRA System Organ Class Preferred Term 3 . 5 mg zolpidem tartrate ( n = 150 ) Placebo ( n = 145 ) Gastrointestinal Disorders 4 % 2 % Nausea 1 % 1 % General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions 3 % 0 % Fatigue 1 % 0 % Nervous System Disorders 5 % 3 % Headache 3 % 1 % 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • CNS depressants , including alcohol : Possible adverse additive CNS depressant effects ( 5 . 1 , 7 . 1 ) • Imipramine : Decreased alertness observed ( 7 . 1 ) • Chlorpromazine : Impaired alertness and psychomotor performance observed ( 7 . 1 ) • Rifampin : Combination use may decrease effects ( 7 . 2 ) • Ketoconazole : Combination use may increase effects ( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 CNS - active Drugs Co - administration of zolpidem with other CNS depressants increases the risk of CNS depression [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) ] .
Zolpidem tartrate was evaluated in healthy volunteers in single - dose interaction studies for several CNS drugs .
Imipramine Imipramine in combination with zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction other than a 20 % decrease in peak levels of imipramine , but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness .
Similarly , chlorpromazine in combination with zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction , but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness and psychomotor performance .
Haloperidol A study involving haloperidol and zolpidem revealed no effect of haloperidol on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of zolpidem .
The lack of a drug interaction following single - dose administration does not predict the absence of an effect following chronic administration .
Alcohol An additive adverse effect on psychomotor performance between alcohol and oral zolpidem was demonstrated [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) ] .
Sertraline Concomitant administration of zolpidem and sertraline increases exposure to zolpidem and may increase the pharmacodynamic effect of zolpidem .
Fluoxetine After multiple doses of zolpidem tartrate and fluoxetine , an increase in the zolpidem half - life ( 17 % ) was observed .
There was no evidence of an additive effect in psychomotor performance [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Drugs that Affect Drug Metabolism via Cytochrome P450 Some compounds known to inhibit CYP3A may increase exposure to zolpidem .
The effect of other P450 enzymes on the exposure to zolpidem is not known .
Rifampin Rifampin , a CYP3A4 inducer , significantly reduced the exposure to and the pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem .
Use of rifampin in combination with zolpidem may decrease the efficacy of zolpidem .
Ketoconazole Ketoconazole , a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor , increased the pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem .
Consideration should be given to using a lower dose of zolpidem when ketoconazole and zolpidem are given together .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Pregnancy : Based on animal data , zolpidem may cause fetal harm .
( 8 . 1 ) • Pediatric use : Safety and effectiveness of zolpidem tartrate not established .
With bedtime dosing of zolpidem , hallucinations observed ( incidence 7 % ) ( 8 . 4 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of zolpidem in pregnant women .
Studies in children to assess the effects of prenatal exposure to zolpidem have not been conducted ; however , cases of severe neonatal respiratory depression have been reported when zolpidem was used at the end of pregnancy , especially when taken with other CNS - depressants .
Children born to mothers taking sedative - hypnotic drugs may be at risk for withdrawal symptoms during the postnatal period .
Neonatal flaccidity has also been reported in infants born to mothers who received sedative - hypnotic drugs during pregnancy .
Zolpidem tartrate should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus .
Administration of zolpidem to pregnant rats and rabbits resulted in adverse effects on offspring at doses greater than the recommended human dose ( RHD ) of 3 . 5 mg / day ( approximately 2 . 8 mg / day zolpidem base ) ; however , teratogenicity was not observed .
When zolpidem was administered at oral doses of 4 , 20 , and 100 mg base / kg / day to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis , dose - related decreases in fetal skull ossification were observed at all but the lowest dose , which is approximately 15 times the RHD on a mg / m2 basis .
In rabbits treated during organogenesis with zolpidem at oral doses of 1 , 4 , and 16 mg base / kg / day , increased embryo - fetal death and incomplete fetal skull ossification were seen at the highest dose tested .
The no - effect dose for embryo - fetal toxicity in rabbits is approximately 30 times the RHD on a mg / m2 basis .
Administration of zolpidem to rats at oral doses of 4 , 20 , and 100 mg base / kg / day during the latter part of pregnancy and throughout lactation produced decreased offspring growth and survival at all but the lowest dose , which is approximately 15 times the RHD on a mg / m2 basis .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Zolpidem is excreted in human milk .
The effect of zolpidem on the nursing infant is not known .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Zolpidem tartrate is not recommended for use in children .
Safety and effectiveness of zolpidem tartrate have not been established in pediatric patients below the age of 18 .
In an 8 - week study in pediatric patients ( aged 6 to 17 years ) with insomnia associated with ADHD , an oral solution of zolpidem tartrate dosed at 0 . 25 mg / kg at bedtime did not decrease sleep latency compared to placebo .
Hallucinations were reported in 7 % of the pediatric patients who received zolpidem ; none of the pediatric patients who received placebo reported hallucinations .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Zolpidem tartrate dosage adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients .
Sedating drugs may cause confusion and over - sedation in the elderly ; elderly patients generally should be started on low doses of zolpidem tartrate and observed closely [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Clinical trial experience with other zolpidem formulations ( 5 mg to 10 mg oral zolpidem tartrate ) given at bedtime : A total of 154 patients in U . S . - controlled clinical trials and 897 patients in non - U . S . clinical trials who received oral zolpidem were ≥ 60 years of age .
For a pool of U . S . patients receiving oral zolpidem tartrate at doses of ≤ 10 mg or placebo , there were three adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of at least 3 % for zolpidem and for which the zolpidem incidence was at least twice the placebo incidence ( see Table 2 ) .
Table 2 : Adverse Reactions in Geriatric Patients in Pooled Trials of 5 mg to 10 mg of Oral Zolpidem Tartrate Given at Bedtime Adverse Reaction 5 to 10 mg Oral Zolpidem tartrate Placebo Dizziness 3 % 0 % Drowsiness 5 % 2 % Diarrhea 3 % 1 % Falls in geriatric patients : A total of 30 / 1 , 959 ( 2 % ) non - U . S . patients receiving other zolpidem formulations ( 5 mg to 10 mg oral zolpidem tartrate ) reported falls , including 28 / 30 ( 93 % ) who were ≥ 70 years of age .
Of these 28 patients , 23 ( 82 % ) were receiving zolpidem tartrate doses > 10 mg .
A total of 24 / 1 , 959 ( 1 % ) non - U . S . patients receiving zolpidem reported confusion , including 18 / 24 ( 75 % ) who were ≥ 70 years of age .
Of these 18 patients , 14 ( 78 % ) were receiving zolpidem tartrate doses > 10 mg .
The dose of zolpidem tartrate in elderly patients is 1 . 75 mg to minimize adverse effects related to impaired motor and / or cognitive performance and unusual sensitivity to sedative - hypnotic drugs .
8 . 6 Gender Difference in Pharmacokinetics Women cleared zolpidem tartrate from the body after sublingual administration of a 3 . 5 mg dose of zolpidem tartrate at a lower rate than men ( 2 . 7 mL / min / kg vs . 4 . 0 mL / min / kg ) .
Cmax and AUC parameters of zolpidem were approximately 45 % higher at the same dose in female subjects compared with male subjects .
Given the higher blood levels of zolpidem tartrate in women compared to men at a given dose , the recommended dose of zolpidem tartrate for women is 1 . 75 mg , and the recommended dose for adult men is 3 . 5 mg .
9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9 . 1 Controlled Substance Zolpidem tartrate is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance by federal regulation .
9 . 2 Abuse Abuse and addiction are separate and distinct from physical dependence and tolerance .
Abuse is characterized by misuse of the drug for non - medical purposes , often in combination with other psychoactive substances .
Tolerance is a state of adaptation in which exposure to a drug induces changes that result in diminution of one or more of the drug effects over time .
Tolerance may occur to both desired and undesired effects of drugs and may develop at different rates for different effects .
Addiction is a primary , chronic , neurobiological disease with genetic , psychosocial , and environmental factors influencing its development and manifestations .
It is characterized by behaviors that include one or more of the following : impaired control over drug use , compulsive use , continued use despite harm , and craving .
Drug addiction is a treatable disease , using a multidisciplinary approach , but relapse is common .
Studies of abuse potential in former drug abusers found that the effects of single - doses of 40 mg of oral zolpidem tartrate were similar , but not identical , to diazepam 20 mg , while 10 mg of oral zolpidem tartrate was difficult to distinguish from placebo .
Because persons with a history of addiction to or abuse of drugs or alcohol are at increased risk for misuse , abuse and addiction of zolpidem , they should be monitored carefully when receiving zolpidem tartrate .
9 . 3 Dependence Physical dependence is a state of adaptation that is manifested by a specific withdrawal syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation , rapid dose reduction , decreasing blood level of the drug , and / or administration of an antagonist .
Sedative - hypnotics have produced withdrawal signs and symptoms following abrupt discontinuation .
These reported symptoms range from mild dysphoria and insomnia to a withdrawal syndrome that may include abdominal and muscle cramps , vomiting , sweating , tremors , and convulsions .
The following adverse events which are considered to meet the DSM - III - R criteria for uncomplicated sedative - hypnotic withdrawal were reported during U . S . clinical trials with other oral zolpidem formulations following placebo substitution occurring within 48 hours following the last zolpidem treatment : fatigue , nausea , flushing , lightheadedness , uncontrolled crying , emesis , stomach cramps , panic attack , nervousness , and abdominal discomfort .
These reported adverse events occurred at an incidence of 1 % or less .
However , available data cannot provide a reliable estimate of the incidence , if any , of dependence during treatment at recommended doses .
Post - marketing reports of abuse , dependence , and withdrawal resulting from use of oral zolpidem tartrate have been received .
10 OVERDOSAGE 10 . 1 Signs and Symptoms In post - marketing experience of overdose with oral zolpidem tartrate alone , or in combination with CNS - depressant agents , impairment of consciousness ranging from somnolence to coma , cardiovascular and / or respiratory compromise , and fatal outcomes have been reported .
10 . 2 Recommended Treatment General symptomatic and supportive measures should be used along with immediate gastric lavage where appropriate .
Intravenous fluids should be administered as needed .
Zolpidem ’ s sedative - hypnotic effect was shown to be reduced by flumazenil and therefore flumazenil may be useful ; however , flumazenil administration may contribute to the appearance of neurological symptoms ( convulsions ) .
As in all cases of drug overdose , respiration , pulse , blood pressure , and other appropriate signs should be monitored and general supportive measures employed .
Hypotension and CNS depression should be treated by appropriate medical intervention .
Sedating drugs should be withheld following zolpidem overdosage , even if excitation occurs .
The value of dialysis in the treatment of overdosage has not been determined , although hemodialysis studies in patients with renal failure receiving therapeutic doses have demonstrated that zolpidem is not dialyzable .
As with management of all overdosage , the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered .
The healthcare provider may wish to consider contacting a poison control center for up - to - date information on the management of hypnotic drug overdosage .
11 DESCRIPTION Zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablets contain zolpidem tartrate , USP a non - benzodiazepine hypnotic of the imidazopyridine class .
Zolpidem tartrate are available in 1 . 75 mg and 3 . 5 mg strength tablets for sublingual administration .
Zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablets are intended to be placed under the tongue where they will disintegrate .
Chemically , zolpidem tartrate , USP is N , N - 6 - trimethyl - 2 - p - tolylimidazo [ 1 , 2 - α ] pyridine - 3 - acetamide L - ( + ) - tartrate ( 2 : 1 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Zolpidem tartrate , USP is a white or almost white , crystalline , hygroscopic powder that is slightly soluble in water , sparingly soluble in methanol and practically insoluble in methylene chloride .
It has a molecular weight of 764 . 9 .
Each zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablets includes the following inactive ingredients : colloidal silicon dioxide , crospovidone , magnesium stearate , pregelatinized starch , mannitol , peppermint flavor , saccharin sodium and corn starch .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Zolpidem , the active moiety of zolpidem tartrate , is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines , barbiturates , or other drugs with known hypnotic properties .
It interacts with a GABA - BZ complex and shares some of the pharmacological properties of the benzodiazepines .
In contrast to the benzodiazepines , which nonselectively bind to and activate all BZ receptor subtypes , zolpidem in vitro binds the BZ1 receptor preferentially with a high affinity ratio of the alpha1 / alpha5 subunits .
This selective binding of zolpidem on the BZ1 receptor is not absolute , but it may explain the relative absence of myorelaxant and anticonvulsant effects in animal studies as well as the preservation of deep sleep ( stages 3 and 4 ) in human studies of zolpidem at hypnotic doses .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Zolpidem tartrate disintegrates in the sublingual cavity after administration .
On average , zolpidem tartrate is rapidly absorbed in both genders , with a mean Tmax across studies of about 35 minutes to about 75 minutes .
In healthy normal volunteers ( age 21 to 45 years ) dosed with 3 . 5 mg zolpidem tartrate , the average Cmax and AUC were 77 ng / mL and 296 ng · h / mL , respectively in women .
The average Cmax and AUC were 53 ng / mL and 198 ng · h / mL , respectively in men .
In women , the average Cmax and AUC of the 1 . 75 mg zolpidem tartrate dose were 37 ng / mL and 151 ng · h / mL , respectively .
Food decreased the overall Cmax and AUC of zolpidem tartrate 3 . 5 mg by 42 % and 19 % , respectively , and increased the time to peak exposure ( Tmax ) to nearly 3 hours .
For optimal effect , zolpidem tartrate should not be administered with or immediately after a meal .
Distribution Based on data obtained with oral zolpidem , the total protein binding was found to be 93 % ± 0 . 1 % and remained constant independent of concentration between 40 ng / mL and 790 ng / mL .
Metabolism Based on data obtained with oral zolpidem , zolpidem tartrate is converted to inactive metabolites that are eliminated primarily by renal excretion .
Elimination The elimination half - life of a single - dose of a 3 . 5 mg zolpidem tartrate sublingual tablet is approximately 2 . 5 hours ( range 1 . 4 to 3 . 6 hours ) .
Special Populations Elderly : The recommended dose for Zolpidem tartrate is 1 . 75 mg .
A pharmacokinetic study of 1 . 75 mg and 3 . 5 mg doses of zolpidem tartrate showed that the plasma Cmax and AUC 0 - 4 hr in elderly subjects following the 3 . 5 mg dose was higher by 34 % and 30 % , respectively , than the non - elderly subjects .
The Cmax and AUC of 1 . 75 mg in elderly subjects were consistently lower than those observed for the 3 . 5 mg dose in non - elderly subjects but consistently higher than the 1 . 75 mg dose in non - elderly subjects .
The elimination half - life remained unchanged .
Hepatic Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of oral zolpidem tartrate in eight patients with chronic hepatic insufficiency were compared to results in subjects with normal hepatic function .
Following a single 20 mg oral zolpidem tartrate dose , mean Cmax and AUC were found to be two times ( 250 ng / mL vs . 499 ng / mL ) and five times ( 788 ng · hr / mL vs . 4203 ng · hr / mL ) higher , respectively , in hepatically compromised patients compared to subjects with normal hepatic function .
Tmax did not change .
The mean half - life in cirrhotic patients of 9 . 9 hr ( range : 4 . 1 to 25 . 8 hr ) was greater than that observed in subjects with normal hepatic function of 2 . 2 hr ( range : 1 . 6 to 2 . 4 hr ) .
Dosing should be modified accordingly in patients with hepatic insufficiency [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
Renal Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of zolpidem tartrate were studied in 11 patients with end - stage renal failure ( mean ClCr = 6 . 5 ± 1 . 5 mL / min ) undergoing hemodialysis three times a week , who were dosed with zolpidem tartrate 10 mg orally each day for 14 or 21 days .
No statistically significant differences were observed for Cmax , Tmax , half - life , and AUC between the first and last day of drug administration when baseline concentration adjustments were made .
Zolpidem was not hemodialyzable .
No accumulation of unchanged drug appeared after 14 or 21 days .
Zolpidem pharmacokinetics were not significantly different in renally - impaired patients .
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment .
Drug Interactions CNS - depressants Co - administration of zolpidem with other CNS depressants increases the risk of CNS depression [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Zolpidem tartrate was evaluated in healthy volunteers in single - dose interaction studies for several CNS drugs .
Imipramine in combination with zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction other than a 20 % decrease in peak levels of imipramine , but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness .
Similarly , chlorpromazine in combination with zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction , but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness and psychomotor performance .
A study involving haloperidol and zolpidem revealed no effect of haloperidol on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of zolpidem .
The lack of a drug interaction following single - dose administration does not predict the absence of an effect following chronic administration .
An additive adverse effect on psychomotor performance between alcohol and oral zolpidem was demonstrated [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Following five consecutive nightly doses at bedtime of oral zolpidem tartrate 10 mg in the presence of sertraline 50 mg ( 17 consecutive daily doses , at 7 : 00 am , in healthy female volunteers ) , zolpidem Cmax was significantly higher ( 43 % ) and Tmax was significantly decreased ( - 53 % ) .
Pharmacokinetics of sertraline and N - desmethylsertraline were unaffected by zolpidem .
A single - dose interaction study with zolpidem tartrate 10 mg and fluoxetine 20 mg at steady - state levels in male volunteers did not demonstrate any clinically significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions .
When multiple doses of zolpidem and fluoxetine were given at steady - state and the concentrations evaluated in healthy females , an increase in the zolpidem half - life ( 17 % ) was observed .
There was no evidence of an additive effect in psychomotor performance .
Drugs that Affect Drug Metabolism via Cytochrome P450 Some compounds known to inhibit CYP3A may increase exposure to zolpidem .
The effect of inhibitors of other P450 enzymes on the pharmacokinetics of zolpidem is unknown .
A single - dose interaction study with zolpidem tartrate 10 mg and itraconazole 200 mg at steady - state levels in male volunteers resulted in a 34 % increase in AUC0 - ∞ of zolpidem tartrate .
There were no pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem detected on subjective drowsiness , postural sway , or psychomotor performance .
A single - dose interaction study with zolpidem tartrate 10 mg and rifampin 600 mg at steady - state levels in female subjects showed significant reductions of the AUC ( - 73 % ) , Cmax ( - 58 % ) , and T1 / 2 ( - 36 % ) of zolpidem together with significant reductions in the pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem tartrate .
Rifampin , a CYP3A4 inducer , significantly reduced the exposure to and the pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem .
A single - dose interaction study with zolpidem tartrate 5 mg and ketoconazole , a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor , given as 200 mg twice daily for 2 days increased Cmax of zolpidem ( 30 % ) and the total AUC of zolpidem ( 70 % ) compared to zolpidem alone and prolonged the elimination half - life ( 30 % ) along with an increase in the pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem .
Consideration should be given to using a lower dose of zolpidem when ketoconazole and zolpidem are given together .
Other Drugs with No Interactions with Zolpidem A study involving cimetidine / zolpidem tartrate and ranitidine / zolpidem tartrate combinations revealed no effect of either drug on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of zolpidem .
Zolpidem tartrate had no effect on digoxin pharmacokinetics and did not affect prothrombin time when given with warfarin in healthy subjects .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis : Zolpidem was administered in the diet to rats and mice for 2 years at doses of 4 , 18 , and 80 mg base / kg / day .
In mice , these doses are approximately 7 , 30 , and 140 times , respectively , the recommended human dose ( RHD ) of 3 . 5 mg / day ( approximately 2 . 8 mg zolpidem base ) on a mg / m2basis .
In rats , these doses are approximately 15 , 60 , and 280 times , respectively , the RHD on a mg / m2 basis .
No evidence of carcinogenic potential was observed in mice .
In rats , renal tumors ( lipoma , liposarcoma ) were seen at the mid - and high doses .
Mutagenesis : Zolpidem was negative in in vitro ( bacterial reverse mutation , mouse lymphoma , and chromosomal aberration ) and in vivo ( mouse micronucleus ) genetic toxicology assays .
Impairment of fertility : Oral administration of zolpidem ( doses of 4 , 20 , and 100 mg base / kg / day ) to rats prior to and during mating , and continuing in females through postpartum day 25 , resulted in irregular estrus cycles and prolonged precoital intervals at the highest dose tested .
The no - effect dose for these findings is approximately 70 times the RHD on a mg / m2basis .
There was no impairment of fertility at any dose tested .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Middle - of - the - Night Awakening Trials Zolpidem tartrate was evaluated in two randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled studies ( Studies 1 and 2 ) in patients with insomnia characterized by difficulty returning to sleep after a middle - of - the - night ( MOTN ) awakening .
In these studies , patients met the diagnosis for primary insomnia as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM - IV - TR ) and had at least three prolonged MOTN awakenings per week that were at least 30 minutes in duration .
Sleep Laboratory Study ( Scheduled Dosing ) Adult patients aged 19 to 64 years ( N = 82 ; 58 female , 24 male ) with a history of difficulty returning to sleep after middle - of - the - night awakenings were evaluated in a double - blind , placebo - controlled , 3 - period cross - over sleep laboratory study ( Study 1 ) .
The primary outcome measure was latency to persistent sleep ( LPS ) .
Doses of 3 . 5 mg and 1 . 75 mg of zolpidem tartrate significantly decreased both objective ( by polysomnography ) and subjective ( patient - estimated ) sleep latency after a scheduled middle - of - the - night awakening as compared to placebo .
The effect on sleep latency was similar for females receiving 1 . 75 mg of zolpidem tartrate and males receiving 3 . 5 mg of zolpidem tartrate .
Outpatient Study ( As - needed Dosing ) Adult patients aged 18 to 64 years ( N = 295 ; 201 women , 94 men ) with difficulty returning to sleep after middle - of - the - night awakenings were evaluated in a double - blind , placebo - controlled 4 week outpatient study of zolpidem tartrate .
Patients took study drug ( 3 . 5 mg of zolpidem tartrate or placebo ) on an as - needed ( prn ) basis , when they had difficulty returning to sleep after waking in the middle of the night , provided they had at least 4 hours time remaining in bed .
Subjective ( patient - estimated ) time to fall back to sleep after middle - of - the - night awakening was significantly shorter for zolpidem tartrate 3 . 5 mg compared to placebo .
14 . 2 Special Safety Studies Driving Study A randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , active - control , single - center , four - period , crossover study in 40 healthy subjects was conducted to evaluate the effects of middle - of - the - night administration of zolpidem tartrate on next - morning driving performance .
The four randomized treatments included zolpidem tartrate 3 . 5 mg four hours before driving , zolpidem tartrate 3 . 5 mg three hours before driving , placebo , and a positive control ( an unapproved sedative - hypnotic ) given nine hours before driving .
The primary outcome measure was the change in the standard deviation of lateral position ( SDLP ) , a measure of driving impairment .
The results were analyzed using a symmetry analysis , which determined the proportion of subjects whose change from their own SDLP in the placebo condition was statistically significantly above a threshold thought to reflect clinically meaningful driving impairment .
When driving began 3 hours after taking zolpidem tartrate , testing had to be terminated for one subject ( a 23 - year old woman ) due to somnolence .
Overall , the symmetry analysis showed a statistically significant impairing effect at 3 hours .
When driving began 4 hours after taking zolpidem tartrate , statistically significant impairment was not found , but numerically zolpidem tartrate was worse than placebo .
Zolpidem blood levels were not measured in the driving study , and the study was not designed to correlate specific blood level with degree of impairment .
However , the estimated blood level of zolpidem in patients whose SDLP worsened according to the symmetry analysis is considered to present a risk for driving impairment .
In some women , the 3 . 5 mg dose of zolpidem tartrate results in zolpidem blood levels that remain at or sometimes considerably above this level 4 or more hours after dosing .
Therefore , the recommended dose for women is 1 . 75 mg .
A small negative effect on SDLP may remain in some patients 4 hours after the 1 . 75 mg dose in women , and after the 3 . 5 mg dose in men , such that a potential negative effect on driving cannot be completely excluded .
Rebound effects In studies performed with other zolpidem formulations ( 5 mg to 10 mg oral zolpidem tartrate ) given at bedtime , there was no objective ( polysomnographic ) evidence of rebound insomnia at recommended doses seen in studies evaluating sleep on the nights following discontinuation .
There was subjective evidence of impaired sleep in the elderly on the first post - treatment night at doses above the recommended elderly dose of 5 mg oral zolpidem tartrate .
Memory impairment in controlled studies Controlled studies in adults utilizing objective measures of memory yielded no consistent evidence of next - day memory impairment following the administration at bedtime of 5 mg to 10 mg oral zolpidem tartrate .
However , in one study involving zolpidem tartrate doses of 10 mg and 20 mg , there was a significant decrease in next - morning recall of information presented to subjects during peak drug effect ( 90 minutes post - dose ) , i . e . , these subjects experienced anterograde amnesia .
There was also subjective evidence from adverse event data for anterograde amnesia occurring in association with the administration of oral zolpidem tartrate , predominantly at doses above 10 mg .
