If interfering particle deposition occurs , consider additional diagnostic options .
5 . 3 Radiation Exposure Risk Technetium Tc 99 m contributes to a patient ’ s overall long - term cumulative radiation exposure .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage .
Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate is transferred across the placenta ( see Data ) .
No animal reproductive studies have been conducted with Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate .
All radiopharmaceuticals have the potential to cause fetal harm depending on the fetal stage of development and the magnitude of the radiation dose .
If considering Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate administration to a pregnant woman , inform the patient about the potential for adverse pregnancy outcomes based on the radiation dose from Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate and the gestational timing of exposure .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . , general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data Limited published literature describes Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate crossing the placental barrier .
No adverse fetal effects or radiation - related risks have been identified for diagnostic procedures involving less than 50 mGy , which represents less than 10 mGy fetal doses .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are limited data available in scientific literature on the presence of Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate in human milk .
There are no data available on the effects of Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production .
Based on the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission guidelines for breast feeding interruption after exposure to radiopharmaceuticals , breastfeeding interruption is not recommended for Technetium 99 m pentetate at levels less than 1000 MBq ( 30 mCi ) .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate , any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate is indicated for lung ventilation and evaluation of pulmonary embolism when paired with perfusion imaging and for renal visualization , assessment of renal perfusion , and estimation of glomerular filtration rate in pediatric patients ages birth to less than 17 years of age .
Pediatric use is supported by evidence from controlled studies in adults and dosing and safety are based on clinical experience .
The radiation risk of Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate is greater in pediatric patients than adults [ See Warnings and Precautions , ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use No formal studies of Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate in the elderly were performed to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 11 . 2 Physical Characteristics Technetium Tc 99 m decays by isomeric transition with a physical half - life of 6 hours .
The principal photon that is useful for detection and imaging studies is listed in Table 7 .
Table 7 Principal Radiation Emission DataRadiation Mean % per Disintegration Mean Energy ( keV ) Gamma - 2 88 . 5 140 . 5 The air - kerma - rate ( exposure - rate ) constant for Technetium Tc 99 m is 5 . 23 m2 · pGy · ( MBq ) − 1 · s − 1 [ 0 . 795 cm2 · R · ( mCi ) − 1 · h − 1 ] .
A range of values for the relative radiation attenuation by the various thicknesses of lead is shown in Table 8 .

It is cleared by the kidneys , which results in the ability to image the kidney .
Aerosolized Inhalation Administration Following inhalation of the aerosol , Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate deposits on the epithelium of ventilated alveoli .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Brain Imaging Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate with intravenous administration tends to accumulate in intra - cranial lesions with excessive neovascularity or an altered blood brain barrier .
Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate accumulation in the brain is prevented by an intact blood brain barrier .
It does not accumulate in the choroid plexus .
Renal Scintigraphy The first few minutes after intravenous administration , Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate is present in the vascular compartment within the renal system .
Lung Ventilation Imaging In patients with normal lungs , the deposition of Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate is homogeneous throughout the lungs .
In patients with airway disease , the deposition patterns become inhomogeneous with irregular deposition of Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate in the airways and alveolar regions of the lung .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics After an intravenous administration , the pharmacokinetics of Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate were studied by monitoring radioactivity in serial venous blood samples for 7 hours post - administration .
The mean plasma clearance rate was 6 . 8 ( L / h ) and the mean plasma elimination half - life ( t ½ ) was 2 . 1 hours .
The mean volume of distribution at steady state conditions calculated with clearance and mean residence time was 17 L .
This relatively low volume of distribution after intravenous administration suggests that Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate distributes to the extracellular fluid only .
The rate of elimination of Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate from the systemic circulation appears to be constant over an approximately 20 - fold intravenous dose range .
Absorption Following inhalation Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate was absorbed ( Tmax < 2 hours after inhalation ) and distributed across the lung epithelium ( bioavailability approximately 70 % ) and into the systemic circulation .
Distribution Following intravenous administration , Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate is distributed throughout the extracellular fluid space and is cleared from the body by the kidney .
The steady - state volume of distribution ( Vss ) was 17 L following an intravenous administration .
Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate distribution appears to be limited to the extravascular compartment .
A variable percentage of the Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate binds to the serum proteins ; this ranges from 3 . 7 % following a single injection to approximately 10 % if the material is continuously infused .
Although the chelate gives useful information on the glomerular filtration rate , the variable percent which is protein bound leads to a measured renal clearance rate which is lower than that determined by inulin clearance .
Elimination Metabolism Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate is not metabolized .
Excretion After either intravenous administration or inhalation , excretion is by glomerular filtration .
The mean fraction of intravenously administered Technetium Tc 99 m pentetate excreted in urine over 24 hours was 102 % .
