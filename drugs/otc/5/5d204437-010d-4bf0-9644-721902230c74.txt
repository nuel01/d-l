Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Cardiac disorders : dyspnea , palpitation , tachycardia Ear and labyrinth disorders : vertigo Eye disorders : vision blurred , visual disturbances Gastrointestinal disorders : abdominal distension , abdominal pain , constipation , diarrhea General disorders and administration site conditions : chest discomfort , fatigue , irritability , malaise Immune system disorders : hypersensitivity Nervous system disorders : dizziness , headache , migraines , paresthesia , psychomotor hyperactivity Psychiatric disorders : anxiety , disorientation , insomnia , nightmares Renal and urinary disorders : dysuria , urinary retention Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : hyperhidrosis , pruritus , rash , rash maculopapular 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Severe drowsiness can occur when used in combination with alcohol or other sedating medications .
( 7 ) 7 . 1 Drug Interactions Use of BONJESTA is contraindicated in women who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) , which prolong and intensify the adverse central nervous system effects ( the anticholinergic effects ) of antihistamines .
Concurrent use of alcohol and other CNS depressants ( such as hypnotic sedatives and tranquilizers ) with BONJESTA is not recommended .
7 . 2 Drug - Food Interactions A food - effect trial demonstrated that the delay in the onset of action of BONJESTA may be further delayed , and a reduction in absorption may occur when tablets are taken with food [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Therefore , BONJESTA should be taken on an empty stomach with a glass of water [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) ] .
7 . 3 False Positive Urine Tests for Methadone , Opiates and PCP False positive drug screens for methadone , opiates , and PCP can occur with doxylamine succinate / pyridoxine hydrochloride use .
Confirmatory tests , such as Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry ( GC - MS ) , should be used to confirm the identity of the substance in the event of a positive immunoassay result .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS BONJESTA is intended for use in pregnant women .
( 8 . 1 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary BONJESTA is intended for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy in women who do not respond to conservative management .
Maternal risks are discussed throughout the labeling .
No increased risk for congenital malformations has been reported in epidemiologic studies in pregnant women .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risks for major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data The combination of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride has been the subject of many epidemiological studies ( cohort , case control and meta - analyses ) designed to detect possible teratogenicity .
A meta - analysis of 16 cohort and 11 case - control studies published between 1963 and 1991 reported no increased risk for malformations from first trimester exposures to doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride , with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride .
A second meta - analysis of 12 cohort and 5 case - control studies published between 1963 and 1985 reported no statistically significant relationships between fetal abnormalities and the first trimester use of the combination of doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride with or without dicyclomine hydrochloride .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary Women should not breastfeed while using BONJESTA .
The molecular weight of doxylamine succinate is low enough that passage into breast milk can be expected .
Excitement , irritability and sedation have been reported in nursing infants presumably exposed to doxylamine succinate through breast milk .
Infants with apnea or other respiratory syndromes may be particularly vulnerable to the sedative effects of BONJESTA resulting in worsening of their apnea or respiratory conditions .
Pyridoxine hydrochloride is excreted into breast milk .
There have been no reports of adverse events in infants presumably exposed to pyridoxine hydrochloride through breast milk .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of BONJESTA in children under 18 years of age have not been established .
Fatalities have been reported from doxylamine overdose in children .
The overdose cases have been characterized by coma , grand mal seizures and cardiorespiratory arrest .
Children appear to be at a high risk for cardiorespiratory arrest .
A toxic dose for children of more than 1 . 8 mg / kg has been reported .
A 3 year old child died 18 hours after ingesting 1 , 000 mg doxylamine succinate .
However , there is no correlation between the amount of doxylamine ingested , the doxylamine plasma level and clinical symptomatology .
10 OVERDOSAGE 10 . 1 Signs and Symptoms of Overdose BONJESTA is an extended - release formulation , therefore , signs and symptoms of intoxication may not be apparent immediately .
Signs and symptoms of overdose may include restlessness , dryness of mouth , dilated pupils , sleepiness , vertigo , mental confusion and tachycardia .
At toxic doses , doxylamine exhibits anticholinergic effects , including seizures , rhabdomyolysis , acute renal failure and death .
10 . 2 Management of Overdose If treatment is needed , it consists of gastric lavage or activated charcoal , whole bowel irrigation and symptomatic treatment .
For additional information about overdose treatment , call a poison control center ( 1 - 800 - 222 - 1222 ) .

Mean ± SD plasma ( whole blood for pyridoxal ) PK parameters are summarized in Table 3 .
Table 3 – Mean ± SD Multiple - Dose ( Day 11 ) Pharmacokinetic Parameters of BONJESTA ( given twice daily ) in Healthy Premenopausal Adult Women BONJESTA Mean ± SD AUC0 - 24 ( ng • h / mL ) AUC0 - 12 ( ng • h / mL ) AUC0 - 6 ( ng • h / mL ) Cmax ( ng / mL ) Tmax [ 1 ] ( h ) Doxylamine N = 34 2879 . 4 ± 696 . 0 1573 . 2 ± 406 . 5 883 . 6 ± 228 . 5 173 . 6 ± 45 . 5 3 . 5 ( 1 . 0 - 20 . 0 ) Pyridoxine N = 34 80 . 0 ± 22 . 7 46 . 3 ± 15 . 4 45 . 3 ± 16 . 3 48 . 2 ± 23 . 7 1 . 5 ( 0 . 3 - 16 . 5 ) Pyridoxal [ 2 ] N = 34 1511 . 3 ± 300 . 0 848 . 1 ± 183 . 6 647 . 2 ± 149 . 6 189 . 6 ± 48 . 3 3 . 0 ( 2 . 0 - 15 . 0 ) Pyridoxal 5 ′ - Phosphate null N = 34 1742 . 3 ± 554 . 3 831 . 7 ± 274 . 5 426 . 2 ± 144 . 0 85 . 9 ± 26 . 2 15 . 0 ( 2 . 0 - 24 . 0 ) [ 1 ] Median ( range ) [ 2 ] Baseline corrected values Food Effect In a single - dose , crossover clinical trial conducted in 23 healthy , premenopausal women , the administration of a high fat , high calorie meal delayed the absorption of doxylamine , pyridoxine , and pyridoxine metabolites .
This delay is associated with lower peak concentrations of doxylamine , pyridoxine , and pyridoxal .
The extent of absorption for pyridoxine was decreased .
The effect of food on the peak concentration and the extent of absorption of the pyridoxine component is more complex because the pyridoxine metabolites such as pyridoxal , pyridoxamine , pyridoxal 5 ′ - phosphate , and pyridoxamine 5 ′ - phosphate also contribute to the biological activity .
Food significantly reduces the bioavailability of pyridoxine , lowering its Cmax and AUC by approximately 67 % and 37 % , respectively , compared to fasting conditions .
Similarly , food significantly reduces pyridoxal Cmax by approximately 46 % compared to fasting conditions .
In contrast , food did not affect pyridoxal 5 ′ - phosphate Cmax and AUC .

Doxylamine succinate is not likely to have human carcinogenic potential .
The carcinogenic potential of pyridoxine hydrochloride has not been evaluated .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES There have been no efficacy and safety trials conducted with BONJESTA .
A double - blind , randomized , multi - center , placebo - controlled study was conducted to support the safety and efficacy of 10 mg doxylamine succinate and 10 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride tablets ( a different formulation and dosage strength than BONJESTA ) in the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy .
Adult women 18 years of age or older and 7 to 14 weeks gestation ( median 9 weeks of gestation ) with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were randomized to 14 days of 10 mg doxylamine succinate and 10 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride tablets or placebo .
Two tablets of 10 mg doxylamine succinate and 10 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride were administered at bedtime on Day 1 .
If symptoms of nausea and vomiting persisted into the afternoon hours of Day 2 , the woman was directed to take her usual dose of two tablets at bedtime that night and , beginning on Day 3 , to take one tablet in the morning and two tablets at bedtime .
Based upon assessment of remaining symptoms at her clinic visit on Day 4 ( ± 1 day ) , the woman may have been directed to take an additional tablet mid - afternoon .
A maximum of four tablets ( one in the morning , one in the mid - afternoon and two at bedtime ) were taken daily .
Over the treatment period , 19 % of 10 mg doxylamine succinate and 10 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride tablet - treated women remained on 2 tablets daily , 21 % received 3 tablets daily , and 60 % received 4 tablets daily .
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline at Day 15 in the Pregnancy Unique - Quantification of Emesis ( PUQE ) score .
The PUQE score incorporates the number of daily vomiting episodes , number of daily heaves , and length of daily nausea in hours , for an overall score of symptoms rated from 3 ( no symptoms ) to 15 ( most severe ) .
At baseline , the mean PUQE score was 9 . 0 in the 10 mg doxylamine succinate and 10 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride tablets arm and 8 . 8 in the placebo arm .
There was a 0 . 7 ( 95 % confidence interval 0 . 2 to 1 . 2 with p - value 0 . 006 ) mean decrease ( improvement in nausea and vomiting symptoms ) from baseline in PUQE score at Day 15 with 10 mg doxylamine succinate and 10 mg pyridoxine hydrochloride tablets compared to placebo ( see Table 6 ) .
