Cardiotoxicity Discontinue VYXEOS in patients who exhibit impaired cardiac function unless the benefit of continuing treatment outweighs the risk [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 3 Preparation and Handling Instructions VYXEOS is a hazardous drug .
Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures . 1 VYXEOS is supplied as a single - dose vial and does not contain any preservatives .
Do not save any unused portions for later administration .
Reconstitute and further dilute VYXEOS prior to intravenous infusion .
Reconstitution : • • Calculate the VYXEOS dose based on daunorubicin and individual patient ' s BSA .
• • Calculate the number of vials of VYXEOS based on the daunorubicin dose .
• • Remove the appropriate number of vials of VYXEOS from the refrigerator and equilibrate to the room temperature for 30 minutes .
• • Then , reconstitute each vial with 19 mL of Sterile Water for Injection using a sterile syringe and immediately thereafter start a 5 - minute timer .
• • Carefully swirl the contents of the vial for 5 minutes while gently inverting the vial every 30 seconds .
• • Do not heat , vortex , or shake vigorously .
• • After reconstitution , let rest for 15 minutes .
• • The reconstituted product should be an opaque , purple , homogeneous dispersion , essentially free from visible particulates .
After reconstitution ( but before final dilution ) , each mL will contain 2 . 2 mg of daunorubicin and 5 mg of cytarabine .
• • Use the reconstituted solution immediately .
If needed , store the reconstituted solution in the vial refrigerated at 2ºC to 8ºC ( 36 ° F to 46 ° F ) for up to 4 hours .
Note that the reconstituted product in the vial and the reconstituted product which has been diluted into an infusion solution are stable for a total of 4 hours ( not 4 hours each ) when stored at 2 ° C to 8 ° C . Dilution : • • Calculate the volume of reconstituted VYXEOS required using the following formula : [ volume required ( mL ) = dose of daunorubicin ( mg / m2 ) X patient ' s BSA ( m2 ) ÷ 2 . 2 ( mg / mL ) ] • • Gently invert each vial 5 times prior to withdrawing the reconstituted product for further dilution .
• • Aseptically withdraw the calculated volume of the reconstituted product from the vial ( s ) with a sterile syringe and transfer it to an infusion bag containing 500 mL of 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP or 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP .
There may be residual product remaining in the vial .
Discard unused portion .
• • Gently invert the bag to mix the solution .
The dilution of the reconstituted product results in a deep purple , translucent , homogeneous dispersion , free from visible particulates .
• • If the diluted infusion solution is not used immediately , store in a refrigerator at 2ºC to 8ºC ( 36 ° F to 46 ° F ) for up to 4 hours .
If the reconstituted solution in the vial was stored for 4 hours , the diluted infusion solution must be used immediately and cannot be stored for an additional 4 hours .
• • Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
Only solutions without visible particles should be used .
2 . 4 Administration Instructions • • For intravenous use only .
• • Do not mix VYXEOS with or administer as an infusion with other drugs .
• • Administer VYXEOS by constant intravenous infusion over 90 minutes via an infusion pump through a central venous catheter or a peripherally inserted central catheter .
An in - line membrane filter may be used for the intravenous infusion of Vyxeos , provided the minimum pore diameter of the filter is greater than or equal to 15 µm .
• • Flush the line after administration with 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP or 5 % Dextrose Injection , USP .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS VYXEOS is a sterile , preservative - free , purple , lyophilized cake for reconstitution supplied in a single - dose clear glass vial as follows : • • For injection : 44 mg daunorubicin and 100 mg cytarabine encapsulated in liposomes .
For injection : 44 mg daunorubicin and 100 mg cytarabine encapsulated in liposomes as a lyophilized cake in a single - dose vial for reconstitution .
( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS The use of VYXEOS is contraindicated in patients with the following : • • History of serious hypersensitivity reaction to cytarabine , daunorubicin , or any component of the formulation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
• • History of serious hypersensitivity to daunorubicin , cytarabine or any components of the formulation .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Hemorrhage : Serious or fatal hemorrhagic events with associated prolonged thrombocytopenia have occurred with VYXEOS .
Monitor blood counts regularly until recovery .
( 5 . 2 ) • • Cardiotoxicity : VYXEOS treatment is not recommended in patients with cardiac function that is less than normal .
Discontinue VYXEOS in patients with impaired cardiac function unless the benefit of continuing treatment outweighs the risk .
( 2 . 2 , 5 . 3 ) • • Hypersensitivity : If severe or life - threatening hypersensitivity reaction occurs , discontinue VYXEOS , treat according to standard of care , and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve .
( 2 . 2 , 5 . 4 ) • • Tissue Necrosis : Daunorubicin has been associated with local tissue necrosis at the site of drug extravasation .
Confirm intravenous access before administration .
( 5 . 6 ) • • Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm .
Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception .
( 5 . 7 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Do Not Interchange With Other Daunorubicin And / Or Cytarabine - Containing Products Due to substantial differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters , the dose and schedule recommendations for VYXEOS are different from those for daunorubicin hydrochloride injection , cytarabine injection , daunorubicin citrate liposome injection , and cytarabine liposome injection .
Verify drug name and dose prior to preparation and administration to avoid dosing errors .
Do not substitute other preparations of daunorubicin or cytarabine for VYXEOS .
5 . 2 Hemorrhage Serious or fatal hemorrhage events , including fatal central nervous system ( CNS ) hemorrhages , associated with prolonged severe thrombocytopenia , have occurred in patients treated with VYXEOS .
In Study 1 ( NCT01696084 ) , the incidence of any grade hemorrhagic events during the entire treatment period was 74 % of patients on the VYXEOS arm and 56 % on the control arm .
The most frequently reported hemorrhagic event was epistaxis ( 36 % in VYXEOS arm and 18 % in control arm ) .
Grade 3 or greater events occurred in 12 % of VYXEOS treated patients and 8 % of patients treated with 7 + 3 .
Fatal treatment - emergent CNS hemorrhage not in the setting of progressive disease occurred in 2 % of patients on the VYXEOS arm and in 0 . 7 % of patients on the control arm .
Monitor blood counts regularly until recovery and administer platelet transfusion support as required [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 3 Cardiotoxicity VYXEOS contains the anthracycline daunorubicin , which has a known risk of cardiotoxicity .
Prior therapy with anthracyclines , pre - existing cardiac disease , previous radiotherapy to the mediastinum , or concomitant use of cardiotoxic drugs may increase the risk of daunorubicin - induced cardiac toxicity .
Prior to administering VYXEOS , obtain an electrocardiogram ( ECG ) and assess cardiac function by multi - gated radionuclide angiography ( MUGA ) scan or echocardiography ( ECHO ) .
Repeat MUGA or ECHO determinations of left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) prior to consolidation with VYXEOS and as clinically required .
Discontinue VYXEOS in patients with impaired cardiac function unless the benefit of initiating or continuing treatment outweighs the risk .
VYXEOS treatment is not recommended in patients with LVEF that is less than normal .
Total cumulative doses of non - liposomal daunorubicin greater than 550 mg / m2 have been associated with an increased incidence of drug - induced congestive heart failure .
The tolerable limit appears lower ( 400 mg / m2 ) in patients who received radiation therapy to the mediastinum .
Calculate the lifetime cumulative anthracycline exposure prior to each cycle of VYXEOS .
VYXEOS treatment is not recommended in patients whose lifetime anthracycline exposure has reached the maximum cumulative limit .
The exposure to daunorubicin following each cycle of VYXEOS is shown in Table 2 .
Table 2 : Cumulative Exposure of Daunorubicin per Cycle of VYXEOSTherapy Daunorubicin per Dose Number of Doses per Cycle Daunorubicin per Cycle First Induction Cycle 44 mg / m2 3 132 mg / m2 Second Induction Cycle 44 mg / m2 2 88 mg / m2 Each Consolidation Cycle 29 mg / m2 2 58 mg / m2 5 . 4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Serious or fatal hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylactic reactions , have been reported with daunorubicin and cytarabine .
Monitor patients for hypersensitivity reactions .
If a mild or moderate hypersensitivity reaction occurs , interrupt or slow the rate of infusion with VYXEOS and manage symptoms .
If a severe or life - threatening hypersensitivity reaction occurs , discontinue VYXEOS permanently , treat symptoms according to the standard of care , and monitor until symptoms resolve [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 5 Copper Overload Reconstituted VYXEOS contains 5 mg / mL copper gluconate , of which 14 % is elemental copper .
There is no clinical experience with VYXEOS in patients with Wilson ’ s disease or other copper - related metabolic disorders .
The maximum theoretical total exposure of copper under the recommended VYXEOS dosing regimen is 106 mg / m2 [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Consult with a hepatologist and nephrologist with expertise in managing acute copper toxicity in patients with Wilson ’ s disease treated with VYXEOS .
Monitor total serum copper , serum non - ceruloplasmin bound copper , 24 - hour urine copper levels and serial neuropsychological examinations in these patients .
Use VYXEOS in patients with Wilson ’ s disease only if the benefits outweigh the risks .
Discontinue VYXEOS in patients with signs or symptoms of acute copper toxicity .
5 . 6 Tissue Necrosis Daunorubicin has been associated with severe local tissue necrosis at the site of drug extravasation .
Administer VYXEOS by the intravenous route only .
Confirm patency of the intravenous access before administration .
Do not administer by the intramuscular or subcutaneous route .
5 . 7 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies with daunorubicin and cytarabine , VYXEOS can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of VYXEOS , daunorubicin , or cytarabine in pregnant women .
Daunorubicin and cytarabine are reproductive and developmental toxicants in multiple species ( mice , rats , and / or dogs ) , starting at a dose that was approximately 0 . 02 times the exposure in patients at the recommended human dose on an mg / m2 basis .
Patients should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while taking VYXEOS .
If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , apprise the patient of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females and males of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months following the last dose of VYXEOS [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) and ( 8 . 3 ) ] .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
The safety of VYXEOS was determined in a randomized trial for adults with newly - diagnosed t ‑ AML or AML - MRC [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] which included 153 patients treated with VYXEOS and 151 patients treated with a standard combination of cytarabine and daunorubicin ( 7 + 3 ) .
At study entry , patients were required to have a LVEF of at least 50 % and a prior lifetime cumulative anthracycline exposure less than 368 mg / m2 daunorubicin ( or equivalent ) .
On study , the median number of cycles administered was 2 ( range , 1 – 4 cycles ) on the VYXEOS arm and 1 ( range , 1 – 4 cycles ) on the control arm .
The median cumulative daunorubicin dose was 189 mg / m2 ( range , 44 – 337 mg / m2 ) on the VYXEOS arm and 186 mg / m2 ( range , 44 – 532 mg / m2 ) on the control arm .
Nine patients each on the VYXEOS arm ( 6 % ) and the control arm ( 6 % ) had a fatal adverse reaction on treatment or within 30 days of therapy that was not in the setting of progressive disease .
Fatal adverse reactions on the VYXEOS arm included infection , CNS hemorrhage , and respiratory failure .
Overall , all - cause day - 30 mortality was 6 % in the VYXEOS arm and 11 % in the control arm .
During the first 60 days of the study , 14 % ( 21 / 153 ) of patients died in the VYXEOS arm vs . 21 % ( 32 / 151 ) of patients in the 7 + 3 treatment group .
The most common serious adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 5 % ) on the VYXEOS arm were dyspnea , myocardial toxicity , sepsis , pneumonia , febrile neutropenia , bacteremia and hemorrhage .
Adverse reactions led to discontinuation of VYXEOS in 18 % ( 28 / 153 ) of patients , and 13 % ( 20 / 151 ) in the control arm .
The adverse reactions leading to discontinuation on the VYXEOS arm included prolonged cytopenias , infection , cardiotoxicity , respiratory failure , hemorrhage ( GI and CNS ) , renal insufficiency , colitis , and generalized medical deterioration .
The most common adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 25 % ) in patients on the VYXEOS arm were hemorrhagic events , febrile neutropenia , rash , edema , nausea , mucositis , diarrhea , constipation , musculoskeletal pain , fatigue , abdominal pain , dyspnea , headache , cough , decreased appetite , arrhythmia , pneumonia , bacteremia , chills , sleep disorders , and vomiting .

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on anecdotal data of cytarabine in pregnant women and results of studies of daunorubicin and cytarabine in animals , VYXEOS can cause embryo - fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of VYXEOS , daunorubicin , or cytarabine in pregnant women .
Daunorubicin and cytarabine are reproductive and developmental toxicants in multiple species ( mice , rats , and / or dogs ) , starting at a dose that was approximately 0 . 02 times the exposure in patients at the recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis [ see Animal Data ] .
Patients should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while taking VYXEOS .
If this drug is used during pregnancy , or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , apprise the patient of the potential harm to a fetus .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
Data Human Data Cytarabine can cause fetal harm if a pregnant woman is exposed to the drug .
Four anecdotal cases of major limb malformations have been reported in infants after their mothers received intravenous cytarabine , alone or in combination with other agents , during the first trimester .
Animal Data A liposomal formulation of daunorubicin was administered to rats on gestation days 6 through 15 at 0 . 3 , 1 . 0 , or 2 . 0 mg / kg / day ( about 0 . 04 , 0 . 14 , or 0 . 27 the recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) and produced severe maternal toxicity and embryolethality at 2 . 0 mg / kg / day and was embryotoxic and caused fetal malformations ( anophthalmia , microphthalmia , incomplete ossification ) at 0 . 3 mg / kg / day .
Embryotoxicity was characterized by increased embryo - fetal deaths , reduced numbers of litters , and reduced litter sizes .
Cytarabine was teratogenic in mice ( cleft palate , phocomelia , deformed appendages , skeletal abnormalities ) when doses ≥ 2 mg / kg / day were administered IP during the period of organogenesis ( about 0 . 06 times the recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) , and in rats ( deformed appendages ) when 20 mg / kg was administered as a single IP dose on day 12 of gestation ( about 1 . 2 times the recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
Single IP doses of 50 mg / kg in rats ( about 3 times the recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) on day 14 of gestation reduced prenatal and postnatal brain size and permanent impairment of learning ability .
Cytarabine was embryotoxic in mice when administered during the period of organogenesis .
Embryotoxicity was characterized by decreased fetal weight at 0 . 5 mg / kg / day ( about 0 . 02 times the recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) , and increased early and late resorptions and decreased live litter sizes at 8 mg / kg / day ( about 0 . 24 times the recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of daunorubicin , cytarabine , or their metabolites in human milk , their effects on the breastfed infant , or their effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants , advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with VYXEOS and for 2 weeks after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential VYXEOS can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating VYXEOS .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VYXEOS and for 6 months after the last dose .
Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VYXEOS and for 6 months after the last dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Inferrtility Based on findings of daunorubicin and cytarabine in animals , male fertility may be compromised by treatment with VYXEOS [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of VYXEOS have been established in pediatric patients 1 year and older with newly diagnosed t AML or AML - MRC .
The use of VYXEOS for this indication is supported by evidence of effectiveness from an adequate and well - controlled study in adults with data on safety from two single - arm trials , which included patients in the following age groups : 7 patients 1 year to less than 2 years old , 33 patients 2 years to less than 12 years old , 13 patients 12 years old to less than 17 years old .
[ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No new safety signals were observed in pediatric patients in these two single - arm trials .
No differences in safety were observed by age .
The safety and effectiveness of VYXEOS in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age with newly - diagnosed t - AML or AML - MRC have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 375 patients who received VYXEOS ( daunorubicin 44 mg / m2 and cytarabine 100 mg / m2 ) liposome in clinical studies , 57 % were 65 years and over .
No overall differences in safety were observed between these patients and younger patients , with the exception of bleeding events , which occurred more frequently in patients 65 years and older compared to younger patients ( 77 % vs . 59 % ) .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Dosage adjustment is not required for patients with mild ( creatinine clearance [ CLCR ] 60 mL / min to 89 mL / min by Cockcroft Gault equation [ C - G ] ) , moderate ( CLCR 30 mL / min to 59 mL / min ) or severe ( CLCR 15 mL / min to 29 mL / min ) renal impairment .
VYXEOS has not been studied in patients with end - stage renal disease on hemodialysis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Dosage adjustment is not required for patients with a bilirubin level less than or equal to 3 mg / dL .
VYXEOS has not been studied in patients with bilirubin level greater than 3 mg / dL [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION VYXEOS ( daunorubicin and cytarabine ) liposome for injection is a combination of daunorubicin and cytarabine in a 1 : 5 molar ratio encapsulated in liposomes for intravenous administration .
The liposome membrane is composed of distearoylphosphatidylcholine ( DSPC ) , distearoylphosphatidylglycerol ( DSPG ) , and cholesterol in a 7 : 2 : 1 molar ratio .
Daunorubicin is an anthracycline topoisomerase inhibitor .
The chemical name for daunorubicin is ( 1 S , 3 S ) - 3 - acetyl - 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 11 - hexahydro - 3 , 5 , 12 - trihydroxy - 10 - methoxy - 6 , 11 - dioxo - 1 - naphthacenyl - 3 - amino - 2 , 3 , 6 - trideoxy - α - L - lyxo - hexopyranoside ; its molecular weight is 527 . 52 .
Daunorubicin has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Cytarabine is a nucleoside metabolic inhibitor .
The chemical name of cytarabine is 4 - amino - 1 - β - D - arabinofuranosyl - 2 ( 1 H ) - pyrimidinone ; its molecular weight is 243 . 22 .
Cytarabine has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] VYXEOS liposome for injection is supplied as a sterile , preservative - free , purple , lyophilized cake , in a single - dose vial .
Each vial contains 44 mg daunorubicin and 100 mg cytarabine , and the following inactive ingredients : distearoylphosphatidylcholine 454 mg , distearoylphosphatidylglycerol 132 mg , cholesterol HP 32 mg , copper gluconate 100 mg , triethanolamine 4 mg , and sucrose 2054 mg .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action VYXEOS ( daunorubicin and cytarabine ) liposome for injection is a liposomal formulation of daunorubicin and cytarabine at a fixed 1 : 5 molar ratio .
The 1 : 5 molar ratio of daunorubicin : cytarabine has been shown to have synergistic effects at killing leukemia cells in vitro and in murine models .
Daunorubicin has antimitotic and cytotoxic activity , which is achieved by forming complexes with DNA , inhibiting topoisomerase II activity , inhibiting DNA polymerase activity , affecting regulation of gene expression , and producing DNA - damaging free radicals .
Cytarabine is a cell cycle phase - specific antineoplastic agent , affecting cells only during the S - phase of cell division .
Cytarabine acts primarily through inhibition of DNA polymerase .
Based on animal data , the liposomes enter and persist in the bone marrow , where they are taken up intact by bone marrow cells .
In leukemia - bearing mice , the liposomes are taken up by leukemia cells to a greater extent than by normal bone marrow cells .
After cellular internalization , liposomes undergo degradation releasing cytarabine and daunorubicin within the intracellular environment .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology At the therapeutic exposures with the recommended dosing regimen , no large mean changes in the QTc interval ( i . e . , > 20 msecs ) were observed .
An exposure - QTc analysis suggested no concentration - dependent QTc interval prolongation .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin and cytarabine administered as VYXEOS were investigated in adult patients who received a dose of daunorubicin 44 mg / m2 and cytarabine 100 mg / m2 administered as a 90 - minute intravenous infusion on days 1 , 3 , and 5 .
The pharmacokinetics of each drug was based on total plasma concentrations ( i . e . , encapsulated plus unencapsulated drug ) .
Following the dose administered on day 5 , the mean ( % coefficient of variation [ CV ] ) maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) for daunorubicin was 26 . 0 ( 32 . 7 % ) mcg / mL and cytarabine was 62 . 2 ( 33 . 7 % ) mcg / mL .
The mean ( % CV ) area under the curve ( AUC ) during one dosing interval for daunorubicin was 637 ( 38 . 4 % ) mcg ∙ h / mL and cytarabine was 1900 ( 44 . 3 % ) mcg ∙ h / mL .
The accumulation ratio was 1 . 3 for daunorubicin and 1 . 4 for cytarabine .
There was no evidence of time - dependent kinetics or major departures from dose proportionality over the range of 1 . 3 mg / 3 mg per m2 to 59 mg / 134 mg per m2 ( 0 . 03 to 1 . 3 times the approved recommended dosage ) .
Distribution The volume of distribution ( % CV ) for daunorubicin is 6 . 6 L ( 36 . 8 % ) and cytarabine is 7 . 1 L ( 49 . 2 % ) .
Plasma protein binding was not evaluated .
Elimination VYXEOS exhibits a prolonged half - life ( % CV ) of 31 . 5 h ( 28 . 5 % ) for daunorubicin and 40 . 4 h ( 24 . 2 % ) for cytarabine with greater than 99 % of the daunorubicin and cytarabine in the plasma remaining encapsulated within the liposomes .
The clearance ( % CV ) is 0 . 16 L / h ( 53 . 3 % ) for daunorubicin and 0 . 13 L / h ( 60 . 2 % ) for cytarabine .
Metabolism Subsequent to release from VYXEOS liposomes , daunorubicin is catalyzed by aldoketo reductase and carbonyl reductase enzymes to the active metabolite daunorubicinol .
Cytarabine is metabolized by cytidine deaminase to the inactive metabolite 1 - β - D - arabinofuranosyluracil ( AraU ) .
Excretion Urinary excretion of daunorubicin and daunorubicinol accounts for 9 % of the administered dose of daunorubicin , and urinary excretion of cytarabine and AraU accounts for 71 % of the administered dose of cytarabine .
Specific Populations No clinically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of daunorubicin and cytarabine were observed based on age ( 1 to 81 years ) , sex , race , body weight ( 9 to 156 kg ) , body mass index ( 14 to 48 kg / m2 ) , and white blood cell count ( 0 . 2 to 111 Gi / L ) after adjusting dose by body surface area .
Pediatric Patients The exposures of total daunorubicin and cytarabine observed in pediatric patients were within the values observed in adults given the same dose based on body surface area .
Geriatric Patients The exposures of total daunorubicin and cytarabine observed in patients aged > 65 years were within the values observed in patients aged 18 to 64 years given the same dose based on body surface area .
Patients with Renal Impairment Comparing to patients with normal renal function ( n = 7 , CLcr ≥ 90 mL / min ) , patients with moderate renal impairment ( n = 8 , CLcr 30 to 59 mL / min ) showed 8 % and 6 % decrease , respectively , in the mean AUCtau of total cytarabine and daunorubicin ; patients with severe renal impairment ( n = 6 , CLcr 15 to 29 mL / min ) showed 0 . 4 % increase and 3 % decrease , respectively , in the mean AUCtau of cytarabine and daunorubicin in a dedicated study .
There are no data in patients with end - stage renal disease managed with hemodialysis .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of total cytarabine and daunorubicin were not altered in patients with bilirubin less than and equal to 3 mg / dL .
The pharmacokinetics in patients with bilirubin greater than 3 mg / dL is unknown .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity , mutagenicity , and impairment of fertility studies with VYXEOS ( daunorubicin and cytarabine ) liposome for injection have not been conducted .
Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity studies have been conducted with daunorubicin .
Published literature reported data that suggest daunorubicin ( 5 mg / kg ) could be tumorigenic in rats at 0 . 68 times the recommended human dose on an mg / m2 basis .
A high incidence of mammary tumors was observed about 120 days after a single intravenous dose of 12 . 5 mg / kg daunorubicin in rats ( about 1 . 7 times the recommended human dose on an mg / m2 basis ) .
A carcinogenic evaluation of daunorubicin by the IARC Working Group classified daunorubicin as a possible human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence in animals and inadequate data in humans .
Daunorubicin was mutagenic in in vitro tests ( Ames assay , V79 hamster cell assay ) , and clastogenic in in vitro ( CCRF - CEM human lymphoblasts ) and in in vivo ( SCE assay in mouse bone marrow ) tests .
Daunorubicin intravenous doses of 0 . 25 mg / kg / day ( about 0 . 12 times the recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) in male dogs caused testicular atrophy and total aplasia of spermatocytes in the seminiferous tubules .
Cytarabine was mutagenic in in vitro tests and was clastogenic in vitro ( chromosome aberrations and SCE in human leukocytes ) and in vivo ( chromosome aberrations and SCE assay in rodent bone marrow , mouse micronucleus assay ) .
Cytarabine caused the transformation of hamster embryo cells and rat H43 cells in vitro .
No studies assessing the impact of cytarabine on fertility are available in the literature .
Cytarabine was clastogenic to meiotic cells ; a dose - dependent increase in sperm - head abnormalities and chromosomal aberrations occurred in mice given IP cytarabine .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Study 1 Study 1 ( NCT01696084 ) was a randomized , multicenter , open - label , active - controlled study which compared VYXEOS to a standard combination of cytarabine and daunorubicin ( 7 + 3 ) in patients 60 to 75 years of age with newly diagnosed t - AML or AML - MRC .
The patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) and stratified by age and AML sub - type to receive VYXEOS or 7 + 3 for induction and consolidation .
VYXEOS ( daunorubicin 44 mg / m2 and cytarabine 100 mg / m2 ) liposome was given intravenously on days 1 , 3 , and 5 for the first induction and on days 1 and 3 for the second induction if needed .
For consolidation , the VYXEOS dose was ( daunorubicin 29 mg / m2 and cytarabine 65 mg / m2 ) liposome on days 1 and 3 .
In the 7 + 3 arm , first induction consisted of cytarabine 100 mg / m2 / day on days 1 through 7 by continuous infusion and daunorubicin 60 mg / m2 / day on days 1 , 2 , and 3 ; for second induction and consolidation cycles , cytarabine 100 mg / m2 / day was given on days 1 through 5 and daunorubicin 60 mg / m2 / day on days 1 and 2 .
Patients could receive up to 2 cycles of induction and 2 cycles of consolidation in each arm .
A second induction was highly recommended for patients who did not achieve a response and was mandatory for patients achieving greater than 50 % reduction in percent blasts .
Post remission therapy with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) was permitted either in place of or after consolidation chemotherapy .
There were 153 patients randomized to VYXEOS and 156 patients randomized to the 7 + 3 control arm .
The randomized patients had a median age of 68 ( range , 60 - 75 years ) , 61 % were male , and 88 % had an ECOG performance status of 0 – 1 .
Twenty percent had t - AML , 54 % had AML with an antecedent hematological disorder , and 25 % had de novo AML with myelodysplasia - related cytogenetic abnormalities .
Thirty - four percent had been treated previously with a hypomethylating agent for MDS .
Fifty - four percent of patients with cytogenetics data had an adverse karyotype .
The demographic and baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between the study arms .
FLT3 mutation was identified in 15 % ( 43 / 279 ) of patients tested , and NPM1 mutation was identified in 9 % ( 25 / 283 ) patients tested .
All patients on the VYXEOS arm and 97 % of those on the control arm received at least 1 cycle of induction , and 32 % on the VYXEOS arm and 21 % on the control arm received at least 1 cycle of consolidation .
The rate of HSCT in first CR was 20 % in the VYXEOS arm and 12 % in the control arm ; the overall rate of HSCT ( induction failure , first CR , or as salvage after relapse ) was 34 % ( 52 / 153 ) in the VYXEOS arm and 25 % ( 39 / 156 ) on the control arm .
Efficacy was established on the basis of overall survival from the date of randomization to death from any cause .
VYXEOS demonstrated superiority in overall survival compared with the 7 + 3 control ( Figure 1 ) .
The efficacy results are shown in Table 6 .
