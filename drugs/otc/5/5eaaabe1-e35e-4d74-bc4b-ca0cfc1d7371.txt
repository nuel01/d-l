DESCRIPTION 3 % Sorbitol Urologic Irrigating Solution is a sterile , nonpyrogenic , nonhemolytic , electrically nonconductive solution in a single dose UROMATIC Plastic Container for use as a urologic irrigating solution .
Each liter contains 30 g Sorbitol in Water for Injection .
pH 5 . 0 ( 4 . 5 to 6 . 5 ) .
Osmolarity 165 mOsmol / L ( calc . )
.
No antimicrobial agent has been added .
Sorbitol is a reduced form of dextrose and is designated chemically as D - Glucitol , [ MULTIMEDIA ] The UROMATIC plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinyl chloride ( PL 146 plastic ) .
The amount of water that can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period , e . g . , di - 2 - ethylhexyl phthalate ( DEHP ) , up to 5 parts per million ; however , the safety of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 3 % Sorbitol Urologic Irrigating Solution is useful as an irrigating fluid for the urinary bladder because the sorbitol solution is nonhemolytic , electrically nonconductive , and provides a high degree of visibility for urologic procedures requiring endoscopy .
During transurethral surgical procedures , the solution acts as a lavage for removing blood and tissue fragments .
It is also useful as an irrigating fluid to maintain the patency of an indwelling catheter in the immediate postoperative period .
If absorbed either intravascularly or extravascularly during transurethral resections , the sorbitol will be either metabolized to carbon dioxide and water via the fructose pathway , or excreted by a normally functioning kidney .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE 3 % Sorbitol Urologic Irrigating Solution is indicated for use as a urologic irrigating fluid with endoscopic instruments during transurethral procedures requiring distension , irrigation , and lavage of the urinary bladder .
It may be used for lavage of an indwelling catheter to maintain patency .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Anuria .
WARNINGS Not for injection .
Not for use in patients with documented or suspected fructose intolerance .
Solutions for urologic irrigation must be used with caution in patients with severe cardiopulmonary or renal dysfunction .
Irrigating fluids used during transurethral prostatectomy have been demonstrated to enter the systemic circulation in relatively large volumes ; thus sorbitol irrigating solution must be regarded as a systemic drug .
Absorption of large amounts of fluids containing sorbitol may significantly alter cardiopulmonary and renal dynamics .
Appropriate patient monitoring should be maintained due to the possibility of fluid overload .
Should fluid overload occur , intensive fluid and electrolyte management is necessary .
Monitoring of fluid and electrolyte levels beyond the acute phase may be considered due to the possibility of delayed fluid absorption .
( See ADVERSE REACTIONS , Post - Marketing Experience ) Hyperglycemia from metabolism of absorbed sorbitol may occur in patients with diabetes mellitus .
The contents of an opened container should be used promptly to minimize the possibility of bacterial growth or pyrogen formation .
Discard the unused portion of irrigating solution since no antimicrobial agent has been added .
PRECAUTIONS The cardiovascular status , especially of the patient with cardiac disease , should be carefully observed before and during transurethral resection of the prostate when using 3 % Sorbitol Urologic Irrigating Solution , because the quantity of fluid absorbed into the systemic circulation by opened prostatic veins may produce significant expansion of the intravascular fluid and lead to fulminating congestive heart failure .
Shift of sodium free intracellular fluid into the extracellular compartment , following systemic absorption may lower serum concentration and aggravate preexisting hyponatremia .
Excessive loss of water and electrolytes may lead to serious imbalances .
With continuous administration of solution , loss of water may occur in excess of electrolytes , producing hypernatremia .
Sustained diuresis that results from transurethral irrigation with sorbitol irrigating solutions may obscure and intensify inadequate hydration or hypovolemia .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with 3 % Sorbitol Urologic Irrigating Solution .
It is not known whether 3 % Sorbitol Urologic Irrigating Solution can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproductive capacity .
3 % Sorbitol Urologic Irrigating Solution should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Irrigation Solutions did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from other younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
Do not administer unless the solution is clear and the seal is intact .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Life threatening adverse reactions with intravenous sorbitol infusions have been reported in patients with fructose intolerance .
The literature reports occasional adverse reactions for intravenous sorbitol infusions .
These include disturbances such as acidosis , electrolyte loss , marked diuresis , urinary retention , edema , dryness of mouth and thirst , and dehydration ; cardiovascular / pulmonary disorders such as pulmonary congestion , hypotension , tachycardia , angina - like pains , and other general reactions such as blurred vision , convulsions , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , rhinitis , chills , vertigo , and backache .
Allergic reactions reported to occur from sorbitol include urticaria .
Should adverse reactions occur , discontinue the irrigant and reevaluate the clinical status of the patient .
Post - Marketing Experience Following off - label use of 3 % Sorbitol Urologic Irrigating Solution for hysteroscopic procedures in women , life - threatening adverse events related to fluid overload have been reported .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The volume of solution needed will vary with the nature and duration of the urologic procedure .
If desired , warm in overwrap to near body temperature in a water bath or oven heated to not more than 45 ° C . Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit .
HOW SUPPLIED 3 % Sorbitol Urologic Irrigating Solution in UROMATIC plastic containers is available as follows : 2B7357 3000 mL NDC 0338 - 0295 - 47 Exposure of pharmaceutical products to heat should be minimized .
Avoid excessive heat .
It is recommended the product be stored at room temperature ( 25 ° C ) ; brief exposure up to 40 ° C does not adversely affect the product .
DIRECTIONS FOR USE Tear overwrap down side at slit and remove solution container .
Visually inspect the container .
If the outlet port protector is damaged , detached , or not present , discard container as solution path sterility may be impaired .
Some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed .
This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety .
The opacity will diminish gradually .
Check for minute leaks by squeezing bag firmly .
If leaks are found , discard solution as sterility may be impaired .
Use Aseptic Technique .
• 1 .
Suspend container using hanger hole .
• 2 .
Remove protector from outlet port .
• 3 .
Attach irrigation set .
Refer to complete directions accompanying set .
