1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE RAPIVAB is indicated for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in patients 6 months and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 2 days .
RAPIVAB is an influenza virus neuraminidase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in patients 6 months and older who have been symptomatic for no more than two days .
( 1 ) Limitations of Use : • Efficacy based on clinical trials in which the predominant influenza virus type was influenza A ; a limited number of subjects infected with influenza B virus were enrolled .
( 1 ) • Consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use .
( 1 ) • Efficacy could not be established in patients with serious influenza requiring hospitalization .
( 1 ) Limitations of Use : • Efficacy of RAPIVAB is based on clinical trials of naturally occurring influenza in which the predominant influenza infections were influenza A virus ; a limited number of subjects infected with influenza B virus were enrolled .
• Influenza viruses change over time .
Emergence of resistance substitutions could decrease drug effectiveness .
Other factors ( for example , changes in viral virulence ) might also diminish clinical benefit of antiviral drugs .
Prescribers should consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use RAPIVAB [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
• The efficacy of RAPIVAB could not be established in patients with serious influenza requiring hospitalization [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Administer RAPIVAB as a single dose within 2 days of onset of influenza symptoms ( 2 . 1 ) • Administer RAPIVAB by intravenous infusion for a minimum of 15 minutes ( 2 . 1 ) Recommended Dosage Single Dose Adults and adolescents ( 13 years and older ) 600 mg Pediatric patients ( 6 months to 12 years of age ) 12 mg / kg ( up to 600 mg ) Recommended Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Altered Creatinine Clearance Creatinine Clearance ( mL / min ) ≥ 50 30 - 49 10 - 29 a Up to maximum dose of 600 mg .
Adults and adolescents ( 13 years and older ) 600 mg 200 mg 100 mg Pediatric patientsa ( 2 to 12 years of age ) 12 mg / kg 4 mg / kg 2 mg / kg • No recommendation for dosage adjustment can be made for pediatric patients 6 months to less than 2 years of age with creatinine clearance less than 50 mL / min ( 2 . 2 ) • Hemodialysis : Administer after dialysis ( 2 . 2 ) • RAPIVAB must be diluted prior to administration ( 2 . 3 ) • See the Full Prescribing Information for drug compatibility information ( 2 . 4 ) 2 . 1 Dosage in Acute Uncomplicated Influenza Administer RAPIVAB within 2 days of onset of symptoms of influenza .
Adults and Adolescents ( 13 years of age and older ) The recommended dosage of RAPIVAB in adult and adolescent patients 13 years of age and older with acute uncomplicated influenza is a single 600 mg dose , administered via intravenous infusion for 15 to 30 minutes .
Pediatric Patients ( 6 months to 12 years of age ) The recommended dosage of RAPIVAB in pediatric patients 6 months to 12 years of age with acute uncomplicated influenza is a single 12 mg / kg dose ( up to a maximum dose of 600 mg ) , administered via intravenous infusion for 15 to 30 minutes .
2 . 2 Dosing in Patients with Renal Impairment Significantly increased drug exposures were observed when RAPIVAB was administered to adult subjects with renal dysfunction [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Therefore , the RAPIVAB dosage should be reduced for patients with baseline creatinine clearance below 50 mL / min using the recommendations in Table 1 and Table 2 .
No dosage adjustment is required for single administration of RAPIVAB in patients with creatinine clearance of 50 mL / min or higher [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In patients with chronic renal impairment maintained on hemodialysis , RAPIVAB should be administered after dialysis at a dose adjusted based on renal function ( Table 1 and Table 2 ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

Do not mix or co - infuse RAPIVAB with other intravenous medications .
RAPIVAB injection is compatible with materials commonly used for administration such as polyvinylchloride ( PVC ) bags and PVC - free bags , polypropylene syringes , and polyethylene tubing .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Each vial of RAPIVAB injection contains 200 mg per 20 mL ( 10 mg per mL ) as a clear , colorless solution [ see How Supplied / Storage and Handling ( 16 ) ] .
Injection : 200 mg in 20 mL ( 10 mg / mL ) in a single - use vial ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS RAPIVAB is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis to peramivir or any component of the product .
Severe allergic reactions have included anaphylaxis , erythema multiforme , and Stevens - Johnson syndrome [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Patients with known serious hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis to peramivir or any component of RAPIVAB ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Cases of anaphylaxis and serious skin / hypersensitivity reactions such as Stevens - Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme have occurred with RAPIVAB .
Discontinue RAPIVAB and initiate appropriate treatment if anaphylaxis or serious skin reaction occurs or is suspected .
( 5 . 1 ) • Neuropsychiatric events : Patients with influenza may be at an increased risk of hallucinations , delirium and abnormal behavior early in their illness .
Monitor for signs of abnormal behavior .
( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Serious Skin / Hypersensitivity Reactions Rare cases of serious skin reactions , including erythema multiforme , have been reported with RAPIVAB in clinical studies and in postmarketing experience .
Cases of anaphylaxis and Stevens - Johnson syndrome have been reported in postmarketing experience with RAPIVAB .
Discontinue RAPIVAB and institute appropriate treatment if anaphylaxis or a serious skin reaction occurs or is suspected .
The use of RAPIVAB is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis to RAPIVAB [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 2 Neuropsychiatric Events Influenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioral symptoms that can include events such as hallucinations , delirium , and abnormal behavior , in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes .
These events may occur in the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur in uncomplicated influenza as well .
There have been postmarketing reports of delirium and abnormal behavior leading to injury in patients with influenza who were receiving neuraminidase inhibitors , including RAPIVAB .
Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice , estimates of frequency cannot be made , but they appear to be uncommon .
These events were reported primarily among pediatric patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution .
The contribution of RAPIVAB to these events has not been established .
Patients with influenza should be closely monitored for signs of abnormal behavior .
5 . 3 Risk of Bacterial Infections There is no evidence for efficacy of RAPIVAB in any illness caused by agents other than influenza viruses .
Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza - like symptoms or may coexist with or occur as complications during the course of influenza .
RAPIVAB has not been shown to prevent such complications .
Prescribers should be alert to the potential for secondary bacterial infections and treat with antibiotics as appropriate .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are discussed in other sections of the labeling : • Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Neuropsychiatric events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] Most common adverse reaction ( incidence > 2 % ) is diarrhea .

Adverse Reactions in Adults ( 18 years of age and older ) In 5 randomized , double - blind , controlled trials , 1 , 399 subjects with acute uncomplicated influenza received a single dose of RAPIVAB , administered intravenously or intramuscularly , at doses up to 600 mg .
Among the 664 subjects receiving RAPIVAB 600 mg ( intravenous or intramuscular ) , the most commonly observed adverse reaction was diarrhea , occurring at a rate of 8 % versus 7 % in subjects receiving placebo .
No subject receiving RAPIVAB 600 mg experienced a serious adverse event and < 1 % discontinued study because of an adverse reaction .
Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities ( DAIDS Grades 2 to 4 ) listed in Table 4 occurred more frequently in subjects treated with RAPIVAB 600 mg ( intravenous or intramuscular ) than placebo .
Only events occurring at ≥ 2 % are included .
Table 4 : Laboratory Abnormalities Occurring in ≥ 2 % of Subjects Treated with RAPIVAB 600 mgLaboratory Parameter Abnormalitya RAPIVAB 600 mg Placebo a Frequencies based on treatment - emergent laboratory abnormalities .
Alanine Aminotransferase ( > 2 . 5 × ULN ) ( n = 654 ) 3 % ( n = 430 ) 2 % Serum Glucose ( > 160 mg / dL ) ( n = 660 ) 5 % ( n = 433 ) 3 % Creatine Phosphokinase ( ≥ 6 . 0 × ULN ) ( n = 654 ) 4 % ( n = 431 ) 2 % Neutrophils ( < 1 . 000 × 109 / L ) ( n = 654 ) 8 % ( n = 430 ) 6 % In a subset of subjects with serious influenza requiring hospitalization treated with RAPIVAB 600 mg as monotherapy ( n = 101 ) , the following adverse reactions were also reported more frequently with RAPIVAB as compared to placebo : constipation ( 4 % versus 2 % ) , insomnia ( 3 % versus 0 % ) , AST increased ( 3 % versus 2 % ) , and hypertension ( 2 % versus 0 % ) .
Adverse Reactions in Adolescent and Pediatric Subjects ( 6 months to 17 years of age ) Assessment of adverse reactions is based on a randomized , active - controlled study in which 130 adolescent and pediatric subjects ages 6 months to 17 years of age with acute uncomplicated influenza received open - label treatment with a single dose of RAPIVAB ( n = 107 ) , or 5 days of treatment with oseltamivir ( n = 23 ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
The safety profile of RAPIVAB in subjects 6 months to 17 years of age was generally similar to that observed in adults .
The only adverse reaction reported in pediatric subjects treated with RAPIVAB ( occurring in ≥ 2 % of subjects ) and not reported in adults was vomiting ( 3 % versus 9 % for oseltamivir ) .
The only clinically significant laboratory abnormality ( DAIDS Grade 2 ) occurring in ≥ 2 % of pediatric subjects treated with RAPIVAB ( and not previously reported in adults ) was proteinuria by dipstick analysis ( 3 % versus 0 % for oseltamivir ) .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of RAPIVAB .
Because postmarketing reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Dermatologic : Stevens - Johnson syndrome , exfoliative dermatitis , rash [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : Anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Psychiatric : Abnormal behavior , hallucination [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS This section describes clinically relevant drug interactions with RAPIVAB .
Drug - drug interaction studies are described elsewhere in the labeling [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Live attenuated influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) , intranasal : Avoid use of LAIV within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after administration of RAPIVAB , unless medically indicated ( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Influenza Vaccines Inactivated influenza vaccine can be administered at any time relative to use of RAPIVAB .
For live attenuated influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) , antiviral drugs may inhibit viral replication and thus may reduce vaccine efficacy .
The concurrent use of RAPIVAB with LAIV intranasal has not been evaluated .
Because of the potential for interference between these two products , avoid use of LAIV within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after administration of RAPIVAB unless medically indicated .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with RAPIVAB use in pregnant women are insufficient to determine a drug - associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes .
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with influenza in pregnancy [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
In animal reproduction studies , no adverse developmental effects were observed in rats when peramivir was administered by intravenous bolus injection during organogenesis at the maximum feasible dose , resulting in systemic drug exposures ( AUC ) approximately 8 times those in humans at the recommended dose .
However , when peramivir was administered to rats by continuous intravenous infusion during the same gestation period , fetal abnormalities of reduced renal papilla and dilated ureters were observed .
In rabbits , administration of peramivir during organogenesis at exposures 8 times those in humans at the recommended dose resulted in developmental toxicity ( abortion or premature delivery ) at a maternally toxic dose [ see Data ] .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - Associated Maternal and / or Embryo / Fetal Risk Pregnant women are at higher risk of severe complications from influenza , which may lead to adverse pregnancy and / or fetal outcomes including maternal death , stillbirths , birth defects , preterm delivery , low birthweight , and small for gestational age .
Data Animal Data Reproductive toxicity studies have been performed in rats and rabbits .
In rats , peramivir was administered once daily by intravenous bolus injection at doses of 200 , 400 , and 600 mg / kg / day on Gestational Days 6 to 17 .
No treatment - related fetal toxicities were observed when peramivir was administered by intravenous bolus injection at the maximum feasible dose of 600 mg / kg , resulting in exposures approximately 8 times those in humans at the recommended dose .
Peramivir was also administered by continuous intravenous infusion to rats at daily doses of 50 , 400 , and 1000 mg / kg / day on Gestational Days 6 to 17 .
Dose related increases in the incidence of fetal abnormalities of reduced renal papilla and dilated ureters were observed at 400 and 1000 mg / kg / day .
The systemic drug exposure in rats at a dose without fetal effects was less than the exposures in humans at the recommended dose .
In rabbits , peramivir was administered once daily by intravenous bolus injection at doses of 25 , 50 , 100 , and 200 mg / kg / day on Gestational Days 7 to 19 .
Developmental toxicity ( abortion or premature delivery ) was observed at maternally toxic dose levels ( 100 and 200 mg / kg / day ) resulting in exposures approximately 8 times those in humans at the recommended dose .
The exposure in rabbits at doses without developmental toxicity was less than the exposure in humans at the recommended dose .
A pre / post - natal developmental toxicity study was performed in pregnant rats administered peramivir once daily by intravenous infusion at doses of 50 , 200 , 400 and 600 mg / kg / day on Gestational Day 6 through Lactation Day 20 .
No significant effects of peramivir on developmental outcomes were observed in nursing pups at up to the highest dose tested .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of RAPIVAB in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Peramivir is present in rat milk [ see Data ] .
Limited clinical data during lactation preclude a clear determination of the risk of RAPIVAB to an infant during lactation ; therefore , the developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for RAPIVAB and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition .
Data A pharmacokinetic study was performed in lactating rats administered a single intravenous dose of peramivir ( 10 mg / kg ) on Lactation / Postpartum Days 11 to 13 .
The maximum concentration of peramivir in milk was reached at 0 . 75 hours post - dose .
The milk to plasma AUC ratio of peramivir was approximately 0 . 5 .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of RAPIVAB for the treatment of influenza has been established in pediatric patients 6 months to 17 years of age .
Use of RAPIVAB for this indication is supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled trials of RAPIVAB in adults with additional data from Study 305 , a randomized , active - controlled trial of 130 adolescent and pediatric subjects with acute uncomplicated influenza who received open - label treatment with a single dose of RAPIVAB or 5 days of treatment with oseltamivir administered within 48 hours of onset of symptoms of influenza [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 2 , 2 . 3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
Study 305 included : • 13 to 17 years of age : 21 subjects treated with RAPIVAB 600 mg • 6 months to 12 years of age : 86 subjects treated with RAPIVAB 12 mg / kg ( up to a maximum dose of 600 mg ) Safety and effectiveness of RAPIVAB in pediatric patients less than 6 months of age have not been established .
No data are available for RAPIVAB use in pediatric patients 6 months to less than 2 years with creatinine clearance < 50 mL / min to inform a recommendation for dosage adjustment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of RAPIVAB did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in exposures between the elderly and younger subjects [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Patients with Impaired Renal Function A reduced dose of RAPIVAB is recommended for patients 2 years and older with creatinine clearance < 50 mL / min [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Dose adjustment is not required for a single administration of RAPIVAB for patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL / min [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
In patients with chronic renal impairment maintained on hemodialysis , RAPIVAB should be administered after dialysis at a dose adjusted based on renal function [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No data are available for RAPIVAB use in pediatric patients 6 months to less than 2 years with creatinine clearance < 50 mL / min to inform a recommendation for dosage adjustment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Patients with Serious Influenza Requiring Hospitalization The use of RAPIVAB was not shown to provide benefit in patients with serious influenza requiring hospitalization [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) , Clinical Studies ( 14 . 2 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no human experience of acute overdosage with RAPIVAB .
Treatment of overdosage with RAPIVAB should consist of general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status of the patient .
There is no specific antidote for overdose with RAPIVAB .
RAPIVAB is cleared by renal excretion and can be cleared by hemodialysis .
11 DESCRIPTION RAPIVAB ( peramivir ) is an inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase .
The chemical name is ( 1 S , 2 S , 3 R , 4 R ) - 3 - [ ( 1 S ) - 1 - ( acetylamino ) - 2 - ethylbutyl ] - 4 - ( carbamimidoylamino ) - 2 - hydroxycyclopentanecarboxylic acid , trihydrate .
The chemical formula is C15H28N4O4 ∙ 3H2O , representing a molecular weight of 382 . 45 .
The molecular structure is as follows : [ MULTIMEDIA ] RAPIVAB injection is a clear , colorless , sterile , isotonic solution ( 200 mg per 20 mL ) in glass vials fitted with rubber stoppers and royal blue flip - off seals .
Each mL contains 10 mg peramivir ( on an anhydrous basis ) in 0 . 9 % sodium chloride solution .
The pH may have been adjusted with sodium hydroxide , USP and / or hydrochloric acid , USP .
The pH is 5 . 5 to 8 . 5 .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Peramivir is an antiviral drug with activity against influenza virus [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Cardiac Electrophysiology At twice the maximum recommended dose , RAPIVAB did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of RAPIVAB was evaluated in Phase 1 trials in adults .
The pharmacokinetic parameters following intravenous administration of RAPIVAB ( 0 . 17 to 2 times the recommended dose ) showed a linear relationship between dose and exposure parameters ( Cmax and AUC ) .
Following intravenous administration of a single dose of RAPIVAB 600 mg over 30 minutes , a maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) of 46 , 800 ng / mL ( 46 . 8 µg / mL ) was reached at the end of infusion .
AUC0 - ∞ values were 102 , 700 ng ∙ hr / mL .
Distribution In vitro binding of peramivir to human plasma proteins is < 30 % .
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis , the central volume of distribution was 12 . 56 L . Metabolism and Elimination Peramivir is not a substrate for cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes , does not affect glucuronidation , and is not a substrate or inhibitor of P - glycoprotein mediated transport .
Peramivir is not significantly metabolized in humans .
The elimination half - life of RAPIVAB following intravenous administration to healthy subjects of 600 mg as a single dose is approximately 20 hours .
The major route of elimination of RAPIVAB is via the kidney .
Renal clearance of unchanged peramivir accounts for approximately 90 % of total clearance .
Negligible accumulation was observed following multiple doses , either once or twice daily , for up to 10 days .
Specific Populations Race : Pharmacokinetics of peramivir was evaluated primarily in Caucasians and Asians .
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis including race as a covariate , volume of distribution was dependent on weight and Asian race .
No dose adjustment is required based on weight or Asian race .
Gender : Peramivir pharmacokinetics was similar in male and female subjects .
Pediatric Patients : The pharmacokinetics of peramivir has been evaluated in a study in pediatric subjects 6 months to 17 years of age with acute uncomplicated influenza .
Pharmacokinetic sampling in this study was limited to approximately 3 hours after administration of peramivir .
Geometric mean ( GM ) PK parameters are provided in Table 5 .
Table 5 .
Geometric Mean ( % CV ) Cmax and AUC0 - 3 by Age Group in Comparison to AdultsAge Group GM Cmax ( ng / mL ) ( % CV ) GM AUC0 - 3 ( ng . h / mL ) ( % CV ) 6 months to < 2 years 38 , 000 ( 73 . 7 ) 46 , 200 ( 35 . 8 ) 2 to < 7 years 47 , 400 ( 48 . 4 ) 62 , 700 ( 39 . 7 ) 7 to < 13 years 61 , 200 ( 53 ) 76 , 300 ( 43 . 1 ) 13 to < 18 years 51 , 500 ( 33 ) 65 , 500 ( 28 . 1 ) Healthy Adults ( Study 113 ) 45 , 700 ( 21 . 5 ) 68 , 500 ( 19 . 1 ) Peramivir pharmacokinetics in subjects 2 to 17 years of age was similar to adults .
In pediatric patients 6 months to less than 2 years of age , the GM AUC0 - 3 and Cmax were lower than that of healthy adult subjects , with GM ratios ( 90 % CI ) of 0 . 68 ( 0 . 52 to 0 . 88 ) and 0 . 83 ( 0 . 59 to 1 . 18 ) , respectively .
The difference in exposure is not considered to be clinically significant .
Geriatric Patients : Peramivir pharmacokinetics in elderly subjects was similar to non - elderly subjects .
Peak concentrations of peramivir after a single 4 mg / kg intravenous dose were approximately 10 % higher in elderly subjects when compared to young adults ( 22 , 647 vs 20 , 490 ng / mL , respectively ) .
Exposure ( AUC0 - 12 ) to peramivir at steady state was roughly 34 % higher in elderly subjects compared to young adults ( 61 , 572 vs 46 , 000 ng ∙ hr / mL , respectively ) .
Dose adjustment is not required for elderly patients .
Patients with Impaired Renal Function : A trial was conducted in adult subjects with various degrees of renal impairment .
When compared to a concurrent cohort with normal renal function , no change in mean Cmax was observed ( 6 subjects per cohort ) .
However , mean AUC0 - ∞ after a single 2 mg / kg intravenous dose was increased by 28 % , by 302 % , and by 412 % in subjects with creatinine clearance 50 to 79 , 30 to 49 , and 10 to 29 mL / min , respectively .
Hemodialysis was effective in reducing systemic exposure of peramivir by 73 % to 81 % .
A reduced dose of RAPIVAB is recommended for adult and adolescent patients 13 years and older with creatinine clearance < 50 mL / min [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
The pharmacokinetics of peramivir has not been studied in pediatric subjects with renal impairment .
Given that the pharmacokinetics in pediatric subjects with normal renal function is comparable to that observed in adults , the same proportional dose reduction is recommended in pediatric patients with renal impairment > 2 years of age [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
In pediatric patients with renal impairment less than 2 years of age , given the developmental immaturity of renal function in this age group , a recommendation for dose reduction cannot be made [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment : The pharmacokinetics of peramivir in subjects with hepatic impairment has not been studied .
No clinically relevant alterations to peramivir pharmacokinetics are expected in patients with hepatic impairment based on the route of peramivir elimination .
Assessment of Drug Interactions The potential for CYP - mediated interactions involving RAPIVAB with other drugs is low , based on the known elimination pathway of RAPIVAB , and data from in vitro studies indicating RAPIVAB does not induce or inhibit CYP P450 .
There was no evidence of drug - drug interactions when RAPIVAB was administered with oral rimantadine , oseltamivir , or oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel ; or when peramivir IM was administered with oral probenecid .
RAPIVAB is primarily cleared in the urine by glomerular filtration .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Peramivir is an inhibitor of influenza virus neuraminidase , an enzyme that releases viral particles from the plasma membrane of infected cells .
The median neuraminidase inhibitory activities ( IC50 values ) of peramivir in biochemical assays against influenza A / H1N1 virus , influenza A / H3N2 virus , and influenza B virus clinical isolates were 0 . 16 nM ( n = 44 ; range : 0 . 01 to 1 . 77 nM ) , 0 . 13 nM ( n = 32 ; range : 0 . 05 to 11 nM ) , and 0 . 99 nM ( n = 39 ; range : 0 . 04 to 54 . 2 nM ) , respectively , in a neuraminidase assay with a fluorescently labeled MUNANA substrate .
Antiviral Activity The antiviral activity of peramivir against laboratory strains and clinical isolates of influenza virus was determined in cell culture .
The concentrations of peramivir required for inhibition of influenza virus in cell culture varied depending on the assay method used and the virus tested .
The median 50 % effective concentrations ( EC50 values ) of peramivir in cell culture assays were 2 . 6 nM ( n = 13 ; range : 0 . 09 to 21 nM ) , 0 . 08 nM ( n = 17 ; range : 0 . 01 to 1 . 9 nM ) and 4 . 8 nM ( n = 11 ; range : 0 . 06 to 120 nM ) for influenza A / H1N1 virus , A / H3N2 virus , and B virus strains , respectively .
The relationship between the antiviral activity in cell culture , inhibitory activity in the neuraminidase assay , and the inhibition of influenza virus replication in humans has not been established .
Resistance Cell culture : Influenza A and B virus isolates with reduced susceptibility to peramivir were recovered by serial passage of virus in cell culture in the presence of increasing concentrations of peramivir .
Reduced susceptibility of influenza virus to inhibition by peramivir may be conferred by amino acid substitutions in the viral neuraminidase or hemagglutinin proteins ( Table 6 ) .

However , a virus may carry a neuraminidase inhibitor resistance - associated substitution in neuraminidase and an M2 ion channel inhibitor resistance - associated substitution in M2 and may therefore be resistant to both classes of inhibitors .
The clinical relevance of phenotypic cross - resistance evaluations has not been established and may be strain dependent .
Immune Response No influenza vaccine / peramivir interaction study has been conducted .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies by intravenous injection of peramivir were not performed .
However , in an oral carcinogenicity study in Sprague - Dawley rats no drug - related neoplasms were observed at drug exposures 0 . 2 - to 0 . 5 - fold that of humans at the clinically recommended dose of 600 mg / day .
Mutagenesis Peramivir was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo assays including the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay , the Chinese hamster ovary chromosomal aberration test , and the in vivo mouse micronucleus test with intravenous administration .
Impairment of Fertility Peramivir had no effects on mating or fertility in rats up to 600 mg / kg / day , at which exposures were approximately 8 - fold of those in humans at the clinically recommended dose .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Peramivir caused renal tubular necrosis and abnormal renal function in rabbits .
Toxicities included tubular dilatation and necrosis with protein casts in cortical areas , dilated tubules with mineralization in corticomedullary junction areas , and multifocal tubular regeneration .
The rabbit appeared to be the sensitive species for peramivir renal toxicity , which was noted at exposures approximately 2 - to 4 - fold those in humans at the clinically recommended dose .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Acute Uncomplicated Influenza in Adults Study 621 was a randomized , multicenter , blinded study conducted in Japan that evaluated a single intravenous administration of RAPIVAB 300 mg , RAPIVAB 600 mg , or placebo administered over 30 minutes in subjects 20 to 65 years of age with acute uncomplicated influenza .
Subjects were eligible if they had fever ≥ 38 ° C ( axillary ) and a positive rapid antigen test for influenza virus , accompanied by at least 2 symptoms ( cough , nasal symptoms , sore throat , myalgia , chills / sweats , malaise , fatigue , or headache ) .
In addition , all subjects enrolled were allowed to take fever - reducing medications .
Study treatment was started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms .
Subjects participating in the study were required to self - assess their influenza symptoms as " none " , " mild " , " moderate " , or " severe " twice daily .
The primary endpoint , time to alleviation of symptoms , was defined as the number of hours from initiation of study drug until the start of the 24 - hour period in which all 7 symptoms of influenza ( cough , sore throat , nasal congestion , headache , feverishness , myalgia , and fatigue ) were either absent or present at a level no greater than mild for at least 21 . 5 hours .
The overall efficacy population , consisting of subjects with confirmed influenza and administered study drug , totaled 297 subjects .
Among the 98 subjects enrolled in the RAPIVAB 600 mg dose group , the mean age was 34 years ; 55 % were male ; 34 % were smokers ; 99 % were infected with influenza A virus and 1 % were infected with influenza B virus .
The majority of subjects ( 53 % ) had influenza illness lasting < 24 hours at the time of presentation .
Overall , subjects receiving RAPIVAB 600 mg experienced alleviation of their combined influenza symptoms a median of 21 hours sooner than those receiving placebo .
The median time to recovery to normal temperature ( < 37 ° C ) in the 600 mg group was approximately 12 hours sooner compared to placebo .
Insufficient numbers of subjects infected with influenza B virus were enrolled to determine efficacy of RAPIVAB in this influenza type .
14 . 2 Acute Uncomplicated Influenza in Pediatric Subjects Study 305 was a randomized , multicenter , open - label , active - controlled trial to evaluate the safety , pharmacokinetics , and efficacy of a single intravenous dose of RAPIVAB administered for a minimum of 15 minutes in subjects 6 months to 17 years of age with acute uncomplicated influenza who had fever ≥ 37 . 8 ° C ( oral ) with at least one respiratory symptom ( cough or rhinitis ) or a positive influenza rapid antigen test .
Study treatment was started within 48 hours of onset of symptoms .
Subjects were randomized to receive RAPIVAB 600 mg ( 13 to 17 years of age ) , RAPIVAB 12 mg / kg up to a maximum dose of 600 mg ( 6 months to 12 years of age ) , or oral oseltamivir taken twice daily for 5 days .
In addition , all enrolled subjects were allowed to take fever - reducing medications .
The overall efficacy population , consisting of subjects with confirmed influenza who were administered study drug , totaled 97 subjects .
Among the 81 subjects treated with RAPIVAB , the median age was 7 . 5 years ; 52 % were male ; 60 % were infected with influenza A virus , 33 % were infected with influenza B virus , and 6 % were co - infected with influenza A and B viruses .
The primary endpoint was the safety of peramivir compared to oseltamivir as measured by adverse events , laboratory analysis , vital signs , and physical exams .
Secondary endpoints included efficacy outcomes such as time to resolution of influenza symptoms and time to resolution of fever ; however , the study was not powered to detect statistically significant differences in these secondary endpoints .
Subjects receiving RAPIVAB experienced a median time to alleviation of their combined influenza symptoms of 79 hours ( interquartile range : 31 to 126 hours ) compared to 100 hours ( interquartile range : 57 to 145 hours ) in subjects receiving oseltamivir .
The median time to recovery to normal temperature ( < 37 ° C ) was 40 hours ( interquartile range : 21 to 68 hours ) and 35 hours ( interquartile range : 16 to 42 hours ) in subjects receiving RAPIVAB and oseltamivir , respectively [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
14 . 3 Serious Influenza Requiring Hospitalization The efficacy of RAPIVAB could not be established in patients with serious influenza requiring hospitalization [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ] .
A randomized , double - blind , multicenter , placebo - controlled trial ( Study 301 ) was conducted in 398 subjects with serious influenza requiring hospitalization .
Subjects were randomized to receive RAPIVAB 600 mg daily for 5 days plus standard of care versus standard of care plus placebo within 72 hours of start of symptoms .
The primary endpoint was time to clinical resolution defined as the time in hours from initiation of study treatment until resolution of at least 4 of 5 signs ( temperature , oxygen saturation , respiration rate , heart rate , or systolic blood pressure ) , maintained for at least 24 hours .
RAPIVAB plus standard of care did not improve median time to clinical resolution compared with standard of care alone .
