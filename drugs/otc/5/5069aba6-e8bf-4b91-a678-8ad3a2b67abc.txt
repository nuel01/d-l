( 5 . 1 ) 5 . 1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Infusion - Associated Events Hypersensitivity reactions including infusion - associated events have been reported during and post - infusion with INMAZEB .
These may include acute , life - threatening reactions during and after the infusion .
Monitor all patients for signs and symptoms including , but not limited to , hypotension , chills and elevation of fever , during and following INMAZEB infusion .
In the case of severe or life - threatening hypersensitivity reactions , discontinue the administration of INMAZEB immediately and administer appropriate emergency care [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Infusion could not be completed in 1 % of subjects who received INMAZEB due to infusion - associated adverse events .
The rate of infusion of INMAZEB may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops any signs of infusion - associated events or other adverse events [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Infusion - Associated Events [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] The most common adverse events ( incidence ≥ 20 % ) were pyrexia , chills , tachycardia , tachypnea , and vomiting .
( 6 . 1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Regeneron at 1 - 844 - 734 - 6643 or FDA AT 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Overall , 382 adult and pediatric subjects with Zaire ebolavirus infection received INMAZEB in one clinical trial ( the PALM trial ) and as part of an expanded access program conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo during a Zaire ebolavirus outbreak in 2018 - 2019 .
In the PALM trial , the safety of INMAZEB was evaluated in a multi - center , open - label , randomized controlled trial , in which 154 subjects ( 115 adult subjects and 39 pediatric subjects ) received INMAZEB [ 50 mg of atoltivimab , 50 mg of maftivimab , and 50 mg of odesivimab per kg ( 3 mL / kg ) ] intravenously as a single infusion and 168 subjects received an investigational control [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
All subjects received optimized standard of care treatment .
During the same outbreak , INMAZEB [ 50 mg of atoltivimab , 50 mg of maftivimab , and 50 mg of odesivimab per kg ( 3 mL / kg ) ] was given to 228 subjects ( 190 adult subjects and 38 pediatric subjects ) in the expanded access program .
The safety data described below is derived from the PALM trial .
Table 4 summarizes adverse events that were reported during INMAZEB infusion .
The evaluation of adverse events in subjects who received INMAZEB may have been confounded by the signs and symptoms of the underlying Zaire ebolavirus infection .
The most common adverse events reported in at least 20 % of subjects who received INMAZEB were pyrexia ( or elevation in fever ) , chills , tachycardia , tachypnea , and vomiting .
The adverse event profile in adult and pediatric subjects treated with INMAZEB was similar .
Table 4 : Adverse Events That Occurred during INMAZEB Infusion in ≥ 10 % of Adult and Pediatric Subjects in the PALM TrialAdverse Event [ 1 ] INMAZEB ( N = 154 ) % Control [ 2 ] ( N = 168 ) % Pyrexia ( Elevation in fever ) 54 58 Chills 39 33 Tachycardia 20 32 Tachypnea 19 28 Vomiting [ 3 ] 19 23 Hypotension 15 31 Diarrhea null 11 18 Hypoxia null 10 11 [ 1 ] Adverse events in this table were reported as preferred terms from a list of pre - defined or other adverse events that occurred on the day of infusion , and included signs and symptoms that occurred during or immediately after infusion [ 2 ] Investigational therapy administered as three separate infusions [ 3 ] Adverse events that were not pre - specified The following pre - specified symptoms , which were assessed on a daily basis while admitted to the treatment unit , were reported in 40 % or more of subjects who received INMAZEB : diarrhea , pyrexia , and vomiting .
Evaluation of these symptoms may have been confounded by the underlying Zaire ebolavirus infection .
Discontinuation and Infusion Rate Adjustments in the PALM Trial Approximately 99 % of subjects who received INMAZEB in the PALM trial were able to complete their dose within three hours .
Two subjects who received INMAZEB ( 1 % ) did not receive their complete infusion .
One of the two subjects did not complete their INMAZEB infusion because of fever elevation [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Selected Laboratory Abnormalities in the PALM Trial Table 5 presents selected laboratory abnormalities ( worsening to Grade 3 or 4 compared to baseline ) for adult and pediatric subjects in the PALM trial .
Table 5 : Selected Grade 3 and 4 Laboratory Abnormalities , Worsened Grade from Baseline for Adult and Pediatric Subjects in the PALM TrialLaboratory Test [ 1 ] INMAZEB N = 154 % Control N = 168 % ULN = upper limit of normal Sodium , high ≥ 154 mmol / L 9 4 Sodium , low < 125 mmol / L 7 11 Potassium , high ≥ 6 . 5 mmol / L 13 12 Potassium , low < 2 . 5 mmol / L 9 8 Creatinine ( mg / dL ) ≥ 1 . 8 × ULN [ 2 ] 15 23 Alanine aminotransferase ( U / L ) ≥ 5 × ULN 10 14 Aspartate aminotransferase ( U / L ) ≥ 5 × ULN 21 18 [ 1 ] Graded per Division of AIDS ( DAIDS ) v2 . 1 [ 2 ] ULN for creatinine was 1 . 2 mg / dL .
Criterion for increase to ≥ 1 . 5 × from baseline was applied if the worsening grade was higher .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is potential for immunogenicity .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the study described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other atoltivimab , maftivimab , and odesivimab products may be misleading .
The development of anti - atoltivimab , anti - maftivimab , and anti - odesivimab antibodies was evaluated in 24 healthy adults in a single dose , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , dose escalation study .
Immunogenic responses against atoltivimab , maftivimab , and odesivimab were not detected at baseline or through 168 days post - dose in any subjects .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Interaction with live vaccine indicated for prevention of Zaire ebolavirus infection : No vaccine interaction studies have been performed .
INMAZEB may reduce the efficacy of the live vaccine .
The interval between live vaccination following initiation of INMAZEB therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines .
( 7 . 1 ) 7 . 1 Vaccine Interactions No vaccine - therapeutic interaction studies have been performed in human subjects using INMAZEB .
However , because of the potential for INMAZEB to inhibit replication of a live vaccine virus indicated for prevention of Zaire ebolavirus infection and possibly reduce the efficacy of the vaccine , avoid the concurrent administration of a live vaccine during treatment with INMAZEB .
The interval between live vaccination following initiation of INMAZEB therapy should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines .
The efficacy of INMAZEB among subjects who reported receipt of a recombinant live vaccine prior to their enrollment in the PALM clinical trial was similar to subjects who did not receive a vaccine .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Patients infected with Zaire ebolavirus should be instructed not to breastfeed due to the potential for Zaire ebolavirus transmission .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Zaire ebolavirus infection is life - threatening for both the mother and fetus and treatment should not be withheld due to pregnancy ( see Clinical Considerations ) .
Available data from the PALM trial and an expanded access program in which pregnant women with Zaire ebolavirus infection were treated with INMAZEB demonstrate the high rate of maternal and fetal / neonatal morbidity consistent with published literature regarding the risk associated with underlying maternal Zaire ebolavirus infection .
These data are insufficient to evaluate for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or adverse maternal / fetal outcome .
Animal reproduction studies with INMAZEB have not been conducted .
Human monoclonal antibodies , such as INMAZEB , are transported across the placenta ; therefore , INMAZEB has the potential to be transferred from the mother to the developing fetus .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk Maternal , fetal and neonatal outcomes are poor among pregnant women infected with Zaire ebolavirus .
The majority of such pregnancies result in maternal death with miscarriage , stillbirth , or neonatal death .
Treatment should not be withheld due to pregnancy .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that patients with confirmed Zaire ebolavirus not breastfeed their infants to reduce the risk of postnatal transmission of Zaire ebolavirus infection .
There are no data on the presence of atoltivimab , maftivimab , and odesivimab - ebgn in human or animal milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk .
The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure in the breastfed infant to atoltivimab , maftivimab , or odesivimab - ebgn are unknown .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of INMAZEB for the treatment of infection caused by Zaire ebolavirus have been established in pediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age .
Use of INMAZEB for this indication is supported by evidence from a multi - center , open label , randomized controlled trial of INMAZEB in adults and pediatric subjects that included 39 pediatric subjects birth to less than 18 years of age , including neonates born to a mother who is RT - PCR positive for Zaire ebolavirus infection .
The 28 - day mortality and safety in adult and pediatric subjects treated with INMAZEB were similar [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
An additional 38 pediatric subjects from birth to less than 18 years of age received INMAZEB in an expanded access program .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of INMAZEB did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Of the 154 subjects with Zaire ebolavirus infection who received INMAZEB in the randomized controlled trial , 5 ( 3 . 2 % ) were 65 years or older .
The limited clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects .

Specific Populations The effect of age ( < 21 or > 60 ) , renal impairment , or hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of atoltivimab , maftivimab , and odesivimab is unknown .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action INMAZEB is a combination of three recombinant human IgG1κ monoclonal antibodies each targeting the Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein ( GP ) .
Zaire ebolavirus encodes a sole envelope protein , the glycoprotein , which mediates virus attachment and membrane fusion with the host cell membranes .
In addition , GP is expressed on the surface of Zaire ebolavirus infected host cells making it a target for antibodies that can mediate killing of these cells by antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and / or other effector functions .
The 3 antibodies that make up the combination bind to 3 non - overlapping epitopes on GP and all 3 antibodies can bind the GP simultaneously .
The mean KD values for atoltivimab , maftivimab , and odesivimab were 7 . 84 nM , 3 . 34 nM , and 8 . 26 nM , respectively , as determined by surface plasmon resonance .
Maftivimab is a neutralizing antibody that blocks entry of the virus into susceptible cells .
Odesivimab is a non - neutralizing antibody that induces antibody - dependent effector function through FcyRIIIa signaling when bound to its target .
Odesivimab also binds to the soluble form of Zaire ebolavirus glycoprotein ( sGP ) .
Atoltivimab combines both neutralization and FcyRIIIa signaling activities .
Antiviral Activity In a live virus infection assay on Vero cells , maftivimab neutralized Mayinga , Kikwit , and Makona strains of Zaire ebolavirus , with a concentration between 0 . 2 and 1 . 2 nM ( 0 . 03 and 0 . 18 μg / mL ) providing 80 % inhibition of viral infection in a plaque - reduction neutralization test ( PRNT - 80 ) .
Atoltivimab and odesivimab did not demonstrate any neutralizing activity in this assay .
Effector function activity of INMAZEB individual antibodies was assessed with an EBOV Makona - GP expressing cell line and Jurkat / NFAT - Luc / FcγRIIIa reporter effector cells .
The EC50 values of atoltivimab and odesivimab were 2 . 9 nM and 1 . 6 nM , respectively , whereas maftivimab did not exhibit any FcγRIIIa signaling activity at the maximum concentration tested , 40 nM .
Treatment of Zaire ebolavirus infected rhesus macaques with a single intravenous dose of INMAZEB ( 50 mg of atoltivimab , 50 mg of maftivimab , and 50 mg of odesivimab per kg ) generally protected infected animals from Zaire ebolavirus mediated death when drug was administered 5 days post - infection .
Resistance No clinical data are available on the development of EBOV resistance to INMAZEB .
The cell culture development of EBOV resistance to INMAZEB has not been assessed to date .
Amino acid substitutions in GP have been identified in isolates collected through routine surveillance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( E280G ) , studies conducted in non - human primates ( G528R , N563T , E564A , E564K ) , and published literature ( I274M , W275L , T544I , H549R ) .
The clinical significance of these substitutions is unknown .
Binding Activity Binding was assessed with an ECL - based assay using virus like particles ( VLPs ) pseudotyped with wild - type or variant EBOV GP .
None of the GP substitutions evaluated impacted binding of INMAZEB by > 2 . 5 - fold based on affinity assessments .
GP substitution E280G impacted the binding of atoltivimab with a ≥ 186 - fold decrease in affinity .
GP substitutions G528R , N563T , and E564K impacted the binding of maftivimab with a ≥ 454 - fold decreases in affinity .
GP substitution I274M impacted the binding of odesivimab with a 4 . 5 - fold decrease in affinity .
Neutralization Activity Neutralization by atoltivimab , maftivimab , and INMAZEB was assessed using VLPs pseudotyped with wild - type or variant EBOV GP .
Odesivimab did not demonstrate any neutralizing activity in this assay .
GP substitutions W275L and E280G impacted atoltivimab neutralization with ≥ 170 - and ≥ 445 - fold increases in EC50 value and had no impact on INMAZEB neutralization potency .
GP substitutions G528R , N563T , E564A , and E564K impacted maftivimab neutralization with EC50 value increases of ≥ 81 - , ≥ 81 - , 38 - , and ≥ 451 fold , respectively , and had no impact on INMAZEB neutralization potency .
GP substitutions I274M , T544I , and H549R did not impact the neutralization potency of atoltivimab , maftivimab or INMAZEB .

14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of INMAZEB was evaluated in PALM , a multi - center , open - label , randomized controlled trial sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ; NCT03719586 ) .
The trial was conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo , where an outbreak began in August 2018 , and enrolled 681 subjects of all ages , including pregnant women , with documented Zaire ebolavirus infection and symptoms of any duration who were receiving optimized standard of care ( oSOC ) .
Subjects were randomized to receive INMAZEB ( 50 mg of atoltivimab , 50 mg of maftivimab , and 50 mg of odesivimab per kg ) intravenously as a single infusion , an investigational control 50 mg / kg intravenously every third day , for a total of 3 doses , or other investigational drugs .
Eligible subjects had a positive reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) for the nucleoprotein ( NP ) gene of Zaire ebolavirus and had not received other investigational treatments ( with the exception of experimental vaccines ) within the previous 30 days .
Neonates ≤ 7 days of age were eligible if the mother had documented infection .
Neonates born to a mother who had cleared Zaire ebolavirus following a course of her assigned investigational medication were also eligible to be enrolled at investigator discretion regarding the likelihood that the neonate was infected .
Randomization was stratified by reverse transcription - PCR cycle threshold calculated using NP targets ( CtNP ≤ 22 . 0 vs > 22 . 0 ; corresponding to high and low viral load , respectively ) and Ebola Treatment Unit ( ETU ) site .
All subjects received oSOC consisting of a minimum of intravenous fluids , daily clinical laboratory testing , correction of hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalances , and broad - spectrum antibiotics and antimalarials , as indicated .
The primary efficacy endpoint was 28 - day mortality .
The primary analysis population includes all subjects who were randomized and concurrently eligible to receive either INMAZEB or the investigational control during the same time period of the trial .
The demographics and baseline characteristics are provided in Table 7 below .
