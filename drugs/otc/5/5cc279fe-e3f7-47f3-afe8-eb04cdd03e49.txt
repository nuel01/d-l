FOR ALL GENERAL IRRIGATION , WASHING AND RINSING PURPOSES Not For Injection By Usual Parenteral Routes Flexible Irrigation Container Rx Only DESCRIPTION Lactated Ringer ’ s Irrigation is a sterile , nonpyrogenic solution of electrolytes in water for injection intended only for sterile irrigation , washing and rinsing purposes .
The composition is based on a modification of the injectable formula originally known as Hartmann ’ s Solution .
Each 100 mL of Lactated Ringer ’ s Irrigation contains : Sodium chloride 600 mg ; sodium lactate , anhydrous 310 mg ; potassium chloride 30 mg ; calcium chloride , dihydrate 20 mg .
The pH is 6 . 6 ( 6 . 0 — 7 . 5 ) .
The solution is isotonic ( 274 mOsmol / liter , calc . )
and has the following electrolyte content ( mEq / liter ) : Sodium ( Na + ) 130 ; potassium ( K + ) 4 ; calcium ( Ca + + ) 3 ; chloride ( Cl − ) 109 and lactate ( CH3CH ( OH ) COO − ) 28 .
Contains sodium hydroxide and may contain hydrochloric acid for pH adjustment .
The solution contains no bacteriostat , antimicrobial agent or added buffer and is intended only for use as a single - dose or short procedure irrigation .
When smaller volumes are required , the unused portion should be discarded .
Lactated Ringer ’ s Irrigation may be classified as a sterile irrigant , wash , rinse and pharmaceutical vehicle .
Calcium Chloride , USP is chemically designated calcium chloride , dihydrate ( CaCl2 • 2H2O ) , white fragments or granules freely soluble in water .
Potassium Chloride , USP is chemically designated KCl , a white granular powder freely soluble in water .
Sodium Chloride , USP is chemically designated NaCl , a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water .
Sodium Lactate , USP is chemically designated C3H5NaO3 , a 60 % aqueous solution miscible in water .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Water for Injection , USP is chemically designated H2O .
The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinylchloride .
Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions inside the plastic container also can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts before the expiration period is attained .
However , the safety of the plastic has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological standards for plastic containers .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Lactated Ringer ’ s Irrigation exerts a mechanical cleansing action for sterile irrigation of body cavities , tissues or wounds , indwelling urethral catheters and surgical drainage tubes , and for washing , rinsing or soaking surgical dressings , instruments and laboratory specimens .
It also serves as a vehicle for drugs used for irrigation or other pharmaceutical preparations .
Lactated Ringer ’ s Irrigation provides an isotonic irrigation with the same ionic constituents as Lactated Ringer ’ s Injection , USP , a modification of Hartmann ’ s Solution .
Lactated Ringer ’ s Irrigation is considered generally compatible with living tissues and organs .
Calcium chloride in water dissociates to provide calcium ( Ca + + ) and chloride ( Cl − ) ions .
They are normal constituents of the body fluids and are dependent on various physiologic mechanisms for maintenance of balance between intake and output .
Approximately 80 % of body calcium is excreted in the feces as insoluble salts ; urinary excretion accounts for the remaining 20 % .
Potassium chloride in water dissociates to provide potassium ( K + ) and chloride ( Cl − ) ions .
Potassium is the chief cation of body cells ( 160 mEq / liter of intracellular water ) .
It is found in low concentration in plasma and extracellular fluids ( 3 . 5 to 5 . 0 mEq / liter in a healthy adult ) .
Potassium plays an important role in electrolyte balance .
Normally about 80 to 90 % of the potassium intake is excreted in the urine ; the remainder in the stools and to a small extent , in the perspiration .
The kidney does not conserve potassium well so that during fasting or in patients on a potassium - free diet , potassium loss from the body continues resulting in potassium depletion .
Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium ( Na + ) and chloride ( Cl − ) ions .
Sodium ( Na + ) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances .
Chloride ( Cl − ) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells .
The distribution and excretion of sodium ( Na + ) and chloride ( Cl − ) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output .
Sodium lactate in water dissociates to provide sodium ( Na + ) and lactate ( C3H5O3 – ) ions .
The lactate anion provides an alkalizing effect resulting from simultaneous removal by the liver of lactate and hydrogen ions .
In the liver , the lactate is metabolized to glycogen which is ultimately converted to carbon dioxide and water by oxidative metabolism .
The lactate anion acts as a source ( alternate ) of bicarbonate when normal production and utilization of lactic acid is not impaired as a result of disordered lactate metabolism .
Since metabolic conversion is dependent on the integrity of cellular oxidative processes , lactate may be inadequate or ineffective as a source of bicarbonate in patients suffering from acidosis associated with shock or other disorders involving reduced perfusion of body tissues .
When oxidative activity is intact , one to two hours time is required for metabolism of lactate .
Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70 % of total body weight .
Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters ( 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production ) .
Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms .
Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium ( Na + ) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Lactated Ringer ’ s Irrigation is indicated for all general irrigation , washing and rinsing purposes which permit use of a sterile , nonpyrogenic electrolyte solution .
CONTRAINDICATIONS NOT FOR INJECTION BY USUAL PARENTERAL ROUTES .
An electrolyte solution should not be used for irrigation during electrosurgical procedures .
WARNINGS FOR IRRIGATION ONLY .
NOT FOR INJECTION .
Irrigating fluids have been demonstrated to enter the systemic circulation in relatively large volumes ; thus this irrigation must be regarded as a systemic drug .
Absorption of large amounts can cause fluid and / or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of administered parenteral solutions .
The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of such solutions .
Do not heat container over 66 ° C ( 150 ° F ) .
PRECAUTIONS Do not use for irrigation that may result in absorption into the blood .
Caution should be observed when the solution is used for continuous irrigation or allowed to “ dwell ” inside body cavities because of possible absorption into the blood stream and the production of circulatory overload .
Aseptic technique is essential with the use of sterile solutions for irrigation of body cavities , wounds and urethral catheters or for wetting dressings that come in contact with body tissues .
The flexible container is designed for use with nonvented irrigation sets .
When used for irrigation via irrigation equipment , the administration set should be attached promptly .
Unused portions should be discarded and a fresh container of appropriate size used for the start - up of each cycle or repeat procedure .
For repeated irrigations of urethral catheters , a separate container should be used for each patient .
Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged .
Discard unused portion .
Pregnancy Category C . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Lactated Ringer ’ s Irrigation .
It is also not known whether it can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
It should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Pediatric Use : The safety and effectiveness of Lactated Ringer ’ s Irrigation have not been established .
Its limited use in pediatric patients has been inadequate to fully define proper dosage and limitations for use .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Possible adverse effects arising from the irrigation of body cavities , tissues , or indwelling catheters and tubes are usually avoidable when proper procedures are followed .
Displaced catheters or drainage tubes can lead to irrigation or infiltration of unintended structures or cavities .
Excessive volume or pressure during irrigation of closed cavities may cause undue distension or disruption of tissues .
Accidental contamination from careless technique may transmit infection .
Should any adverse reaction occur , discontinue the irrigant , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of overhydration or solute overload , re - evaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective measures .
( See WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS . )
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dose is dependent upon the capacity or surface area of the structure to be irrigated and the nature of the procedure .
When used as a vehicle for other drugs , the manufacturer ’ s recommendations should be followed .
Tear at notch and along dotted line and remove container .
Some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed .
This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety .
The opacity will diminish gradually .
Drug Interactions Additives may be incompatible .
Consult with pharmacist , if available .
When introducing additives , use aseptic technique , mix thoroughly and do not store .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution container permits .
