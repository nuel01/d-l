Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Dermatologic : SCAR ( including DRESS and SJS ) 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS MEKINIST is indicated for use in combination with dabrafenib .
Refer to the dabrafenib labeling for additional risk information that applies to combination use treatment .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Do not breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) • Females and Males of Reproductive Potential : May impair fertility .
Counsel patients on pregnancy planning and prevention .
( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] and findings from animal reproduction studies , MEKINIST can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There is insufficient data in pregnant women exposed to MEKINIST to assess the risks .
Trametinib was embryotoxic and abortifacient in rabbits at doses greater than or equal to those resulting in exposures approximately 0 . 3 times the human exposure at the recommended clinical dose ( seeData ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In reproductive toxicity studies , administration of trametinib to rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal weights at doses greater than or equal to 0 . 031 mg / kg / day [ approximately 0 . 3 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on area under the curve ( AUC ) ] .
In rats , at a dose resulting in exposures 1 . 8 - fold higher than the human exposure at the recommended dose , there was maternal toxicity and an increase in post - implantation loss .
In pregnant rabbits , administration of trametinib during the period of organogenesis resulted in decreased fetal body weight and increased incidence of variations in ossification at doses greater than or equal to 0 . 039 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 08 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC ) .
In rabbits administered trametinib at 0 . 15 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 3 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC ) there was an increase in post - implantation loss , including total loss of pregnancy , compared with control animals .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of trametinib in human milk , or the effects of trametinib on the breastfed infant or on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with MEKINIST and for 4 months following the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating MEKINIST .
Contraception Based on data from animal studies and its mechanism of action , MEKINIST can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with MEKINIST and for 4 months after the last dose .
Males To avoid potential drug exposure to pregnant partners and female partners of reproductive potential , advise male patients ( including those who have had vasectomies ) with female partners of reproductive potential to use condoms during treatment with MEKINIST and for at least 4 months after the last dose .
Infertility Females Advise female patients of reproductive potential that MEKINIST may impair fertility .
Increased follicular cysts and decreased corpora lutea were observed in female rats at dose exposures equivalent to 0 . 3 times the human exposure at the recommended dose [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use BRAF V600E Mutation - Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors The safety and effectiveness of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older that weigh at least 26 kg was established based on data in adults and data from a pediatric study X2101 .
In study X2101 , Parts C and D enrolled a total of 48 patients ( ages 1 to 17 ) with the following tumor types : LGG ( n = 34 ) , HGG ( n = 2 ) , LCH ( n = 11 ) , and juvenile xanthogranulomatosis ( n = 1 ) [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 6 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib in pediatric patients younger than 6 years old have not been established .
The safety and effectiveness of MEKINIST as a single agent in pediatric patients have not been established .
Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In a repeat - dose toxicity study in juvenile rats , decreased bone length and corneal dystrophy were observed at doses resulting in exposures as low as 0 . 3 times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC .
Additionally , a delay in sexual maturation was noted at doses resulting in exposures as low as 1 . 6 times the human exposure at the recommended adult dose based on AUC .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 214 patients with melanoma who received single agent MEKINIST in the METRIC study , 27 % were aged 65 years and older and 4 % were over 75 years old [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
This study of single agent MEKINIST in melanoma did not include sufficient numbers of geriatric patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults .
Of the 994 patients with melanoma who received MEKINIST plus dabrafenib in the COMBI - d , COMBI - v , and COMBI - AD studies [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 , 14 . 2 ) ] , 21 % were aged 65 years and older and 5 % were aged 75 years and older .
No overall differences in the effectiveness of MEKINIST plus dabrafenib were observed in geriatric patients as compared to younger adults across these melanoma studies .
The incidences of peripheral edema ( 26 % vs . 12 % ) and anorexia ( 21 % vs . 9 % ) increased in geriatric patients as compared to younger adults in these studies .
Of the 93 patients with NSCLC who received MEKINIST in Study BRF113928 , there were insufficient numbers of geriatric patients aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adults [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
Of the 26 patients with ATC who received MEKINIST in Study BRF117019 , 77 % were aged 65 years and older and 31 % were aged 75 years and older [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 4 ) ] .
This study did not include sufficient numbers of younger adults to determine whether they respond differently compared to geriatric patients .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild ( bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal ( ULN ) and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) > ULN or bilirubin > 1 x to 1 . 5 x ULN and any AST ) hepatic impairment .
A recommended dosage of MEKINIST has not been established for patients with moderate ( bilirubin > 1 . 5 x to 3 x ULN and any AST ) or severe ( bilirubin > 3 x to 10 x ULN and any AST ) hepatic impairment .
Consider the risk - benefit profile of MEKINIST related to dosing prior to determining whether to administer MEKINIST to patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment .
In patients with moderate hepatic impairment , 3 patients who received a starting dose of 1 . 5 mg orally once daily and two patients who received a starting dose of 2 mg orally once daily did not experience dose limiting toxicities ( DLTs ) during the first cycle of therapy .
In patients with severe hepatic impairment , 3 patients who received a starting dose of 1 mg orally once daily did not experience DLTs during the first cycle ; one patient who received a starting dose of 1 . 5 mg orally once daily experienced a DLT ( grade 3 acneiform rash ) .
Compared to patients with normal hepatic function , there was no increase in exposure of trametinib in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE The highest doses of MEKINIST evaluated in clinical trials were 4 mg orally once daily and 10 mg administered orally once daily on 2 consecutive days followed by 3 mg once daily .
In seven patients treated on one of these two schedules , there were two cases of RPEDs for an incidence of 28 % .
Since trametinib is highly bound to plasma proteins , hemodialysis is likely to be ineffective in the treatment of overdose with MEKINIST .
11 DESCRIPTION Trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide is a kinase inhibitor .
The chemical name is acetamide , N - [ 3 - [ 3 - cyclopropyl - 5 - [ ( 2 - fluoro - 4 - iodophenyl ) amino ] - 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 - tetrahydro - 6 , 8 - dimethyl - 2 , 4 , 7 - trioxopyrido [ 4 , 3 - d ] pyrimidin - 1 ( 2 H ) - yl ] phenyl ] - , compound with 1 , 1 ’ - sulfinylbis [ methane ] ( 1 : 1 ) .
It has a molecular formula C26H23FIN5O4 • C2H6OS with a molecular mass of 693 . 53 g / mol .
Trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide has the following chemical structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide is a white to almost white powder .
It is practically insoluble in the pH range of 2 to 8 in aqueous media .
MEKINIST ( trametinib ) tablets for oral use are supplied as 0 . 5 mg and 2 mg tablets for oral administration .

Each 2 mg tablet contains 2 . 254 mg trametinib dimethyl sulfoxide equivalent to 2 mg of trametinib non - solvated parent .
The inactive ingredients of MEKINIST tablets are : Tablet Core : colloidal silicon dioxide , croscarmellose sodium , hypromellose , magnesium stearate ( vegetable source ) , mannitol , microcrystalline cellulose , and sodium lauryl sulfate .
Coating : hypromellose , iron oxide red ( 2 mg tablets ) , iron oxide yellow ( 0 . 5 mg tablets ) , polyethylene glycol , polysorbate 80 ( 2 mg tablets ) , and titanium dioxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Trametinib is a reversible inhibitor of mitogen - activated extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 ( MEK1 ) and MEK2 activation and of MEK1 and MEK2 kinase activity .
MEK proteins are upstream regulators of the extracellular signal - related kinase ( ERK ) pathway , which promotes cellular proliferation .
BRAF V600E mutations result in constitutive activation of the BRAF pathway which includes MEK1 and MEK2 .
Trametinib inhibits cell growth of various BRAF V600 mutation - positive tumors in vitro and in vivo .
Trametinib and dabrafenib target two different kinases in the RAS / RAF / MEK / ERK pathway .
Use of trametinib and dabrafenib in combination resulted in greater growth inhibition of BRAF V600 mutation - positive tumor cell lines in vitro and prolonged inhibition of tumor growth in BRAF V600 mutation positive tumor xenografts compared with either drug alone .
In the setting of BRAF - mutant colorectal cancer , induction of EGFR - mediated MAPK pathway re - activation has been identified as a mechanism of intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 . 6 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Administration of 1 mg and 2 mg MEKINIST to patients with BRAF V600 mutation - positive melanoma resulted in dose - dependent changes in tumor biomarkers , including inhibition of phosphorylated ERK , inhibition of Ki67 ( a marker of cell proliferation ) , and increases in p27 ( a marker of apoptosis ) .
Cardiac Electrophysiology The heart rate - corrected QT ( QTc ) prolongation potential of trametinib was assessed in a dedicated study in 32 patients who received placebo on Day 1 and MEKINIST 2 mg once daily on Days 2 - 14 followed by MEKINIST 3 mg on Day 15 .
No clinically relevant QTc prolongation was detected in the study .
In clinical trials in patients who received MEKINIST with dabrafenib , QTc prolongation > 500 ms occurred in 0 . 8 % of patients and QTc increased by > 60 ms from baseline in 3 . 8 % of patients .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of trametinib were characterized following single - and repeat - oral administration in patients with solid tumors and BRAF V600 mutation - positive metastatic melanoma .
Absorption After oral administration of MEKINIST , the median time to achieve peak plasma concentrations ( Tmax ) is 1 . 5 hours post - dose .
The mean absolute bioavailability of a single oral dose of MEKINIST 2 mg is 72 % .
The increase in Cmax was dose proportional after a single dose of 0 . 125 mg ( 0 . 0625 times the approved recommended dosage ) to 10 mg ( 5 times the approved recommended dosage ) while the increase in AUC was greater than dose proportional .
After repeat doses of 0 . 125 mg to 4 mg daily , both Cmax and AUC increase proportionally with dose .
Inter - subject variability in AUC and Cmax at steady state is 22 % and 28 % , respectively .
Effect of Food Administration of a single dose of MEKINIST with a high - fat , high - calorie meal ( approximately 1000 calories ) decreased trametinib AUC by 24 % , Cmax by 70 % , and delayed Tmax by approximately 4 hours as compared with fasted conditions .
Distribution Trametinib is 97 . 4 % bound to human plasma proteins .
The apparent volume of distribution ( Vc / F ) is 214 L . Elimination The estimated elimination half - life of trametinibbased on the population PK model is 3 . 9 to 4 . 8 days .
The apparent clearance is 4 . 9 L / h .
Metabolism Trametinib is metabolized predominantly via deacetylation alone or with mono - oxygenation or in combination with glucuronidation biotransformation pathways in vitro .
Deacetylation is mediated by carboxylesterases ( i . e . , carboxylesterase 1 b / c and 2 ) and may also be mediated by other hydrolytic enzymes .
Following a single dose of [ 14 C ] - trametinib , approximately 50 % of circulating radioactivity is represented as the parent compound .
However , based on metabolite profiling after repeat dosing of trametinib , ≥ 75 % of drug - related material in plasma is the parent compound .
Excretion Following oral administration of [ 14 C ] - trametinib , greater than 80 % of excreted radioactivity was recovered in the feces while less than 20 % of excreted radioactivity was recovered in the urine with less than 0 . 1 % of the excreted dose as parent .
Specific Populations Age , sex , body weight , and renal impairment ( eGFR 15 to 89 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) do not have a clinically important effect on the exposure of trametinib .
There are insufficient data to evaluate potential differences in the exposure of trametinib by race or ethnicity .
Pediatric Patients : The pharmacokinetics of trametinib were evaluated in 95 pediatric patients after single or repeat weight - adjusted dosing .
The pharmacokinetic exposures of trametinib at the recommended weight - adjusted dosage in pediatric patients were within range of those observed in adults .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment : Based on results from a pharmacokinetic study in patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment defined by bilirubin and AST levels , mild , moderate , and severe hepatic impairment had no significant effect in trametinib exposure or apparent drug clearance compared with patients with normal hepatic function [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Dabrafenib on Trametinib : Coadministration of trametinib 2 mg daily with dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily resulted in no change in AUC of trametinib as compared with administration of trametinib .
Effect of Trametinib on CYP Substrates : Based on in vitro studies , trametinib is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 , but is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2 , CYP2A6 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , or CYP3A4 at a clinically relevant systemic concentration of 0 . 04 µM .
Trametinib is an inducer of CYP3A in vitro .
Based on cross - study comparisons , oral administration of MEKINIST 2 mg once daily with a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate had no clinically important effect on the AUC and Cmax of the sensitive CYP3A4 substrate .
Effect of Transporters on Trametinib : Trametinib is a substrate of P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) and BSEP .
Inhibition of P - gp is unlikely to result in a clinically important increase in trametinib concentrations as trametinib exhibits high passive permeability and bioavailability .
Trametinib is not a substrate of BCRP , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OATP2B1 , OCT1 , MRP2 , or MATE1 in vitro .
Effect of Trametinib on Transporters : Based on in vitro studies , trametinib is not an inhibitor of P - gp , BCRP , OATP1B1 , OATP1B3 , OAT1 , OAT3 , OCT2 , BSEP , MRP2 , or MATE1 at a clinically relevant systemic concentration of 0 . 04 µM .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies with trametinib have not been conducted .
Trametinib was not genotoxic in studies evaluating reverse mutations in bacteria , chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells , and micronuclei in the bone marrow of rats .
Trametinib may impair fertility in humans .
In female rats given trametinib for up to 13 weeks , increased follicular cysts and decreased corpora lutea were observed at doses ≥ 0 . 016 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 3 times the human exposure at the recommended dose based on AUC ) .
In rat and dog toxicity studies up to 13 weeks in duration , there were no treatment effects observed on male reproductive tissues [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 1 BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation - Positive Unresectable or Metastatic Melanoma MEKINIST as a Single Agent The safety and efficacy of MEKINIST were evaluated in an international , multicenter , randomized ( 2 : 1 ) , open - label , active - controlled trial ( the METRIC study ; NCT01245062 ) in 322 patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation - positive , unresectable or metastatic melanoma .
In the METRIC study , patients were not permitted to have more than one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced or metastatic disease ; prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor or MEK inhibitor was not permitted .
Patients were randomized to receive MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily ( N = 214 ) or chemotherapy ( N = 108 ) consisting of either dacarbazine 1000 mg / m2 intravenously every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 intravenously every 3 weeks .
Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Randomization was stratified according to prior use of chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease ( yes vs . no ) and LDH level ( normal vs . greater than ULN ) .
Tumor tissue was evaluated for BRAF mutations at a central testing site using a clinical trial assay .
Tumor samples from 289 patients ( 196 patients treated with MEKINIST and 93 chemotherapy - treated patients ) were also tested retrospectively using an FDA - approved companion diagnostic test , THxID ® - BRAF assay .
The major efficacy outcome measure was progression - free survival ( PFS ) .
The median age for randomized patients was 54 years , 54 % were male , greater than 99 % were white , and all patients had baseline ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 .
Most patients had metastatic disease ( 94 % ) , were Stage M1c ( 64 % ) , had elevated LDH ( 36 % ) , had no history of brain metastasis ( 97 % ) , and received no prior chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic disease ( 66 % ) .
The distribution of BRAF V600 mutations was BRAF V600E ( 87 % ) , V600K ( 12 % ) , or both ( less than 1 % ) .
The median durations of follow - up prior to initiation of alternative treatment were 4 . 9 months for patients treated with MEKINIST and 3 . 1 months for patients treated with chemotherapy .
Fifty - one ( 47 % ) patients crossed over from the chemotherapy arm at the time of disease progression to receive MEKINIST .
The METRIC study demonstrated a statistically significant increase in PFS in the patients treated with MEKINIST .

MEKINIST with Dabrafenib COMBI - d Study The safety and efficacy of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib were evaluated in an international , randomized , double - blind , active - controlled trial ( the COMBI - d study ; NCT01584648 ) .
The COMBI - d study compared dabrafenib plus MEKINIST to dabrafenib plus placebo as first - line treatment for patients with unresectable ( Stage IIIc ) or metastatic ( Stage IV ) BRAF V600E or V600K mutation - positive cutaneous melanoma .
Patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to receive MEKINIST 2 mg once daily plus dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily or dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily plus matching placebo .
Randomization was stratified by LDH level ( greater than the ULN vs . ≤ ULN ) and BRAF mutation subtype ( V600E vs . V600K ) .
The major efficacy outcome was investigator - assessed PFS per RECIST v1 . 1 with additional efficacy outcome measures of overall survival ( OS ) and confirmed overall response rate ( ORR ) .
In the COMBI - d study , 423 patients were randomized to MEKINIST plus dabrafenib ( n = 211 ) or dabrafenib plus placebo ( n = 212 ) .
The median age was 56 years ( range : 22 to 89 years ) , 53 % were male , > 99 % were white , 72 % had ECOG performance status of 0 , 4 % had Stage IIIc , 66 % had M1c disease , 65 % had a normal LDH , and 2 patients had a history of brain metastases .
All patients had tumor containing BRAF V600E or V600K mutations as determined by centralized testing with the FDA - approved companion diagnostic test ; 85 % had BRAF V600E mutation - positive melanoma and 15 % had BRAF V600K mutation - positive melanoma .
The COMBI - d study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in PFS and OS .

Eligible patients were required to have at least one measurable intracranial lesion and to have no leptomeningeal disease , parenchymal brain metastasis greater than 4 cm in diameter , ocular melanoma , or primary mucosal melanoma .
Patients received MEKINIST 2 mg orally once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
The major efficacy outcome measure was intracranial response rate , defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed intracranial response per RECIST v1 . 1 , modified to allow up to five intracranial target lesions at least 5 mm in diameter , as assessed by independent review .
The COMBI - MB study enrolled 121 patients with a BRAF V600E ( 85 % ) or V600K ( 15 % ) mutation .
The median age was 54 years ( range : 23 to 84 years ) , 58 % were male , 100 % were white , 8 % were from the United States , 65 % had a normal LDH value at baseline , and 97 % had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 .
Intracranial metastases were asymptomatic in 87 % and symptomatic in 13 % of patients , 22 % received prior local therapy for brain metastases , and 87 % also had extracranial metastases .
The intracranial response rate was 50 % ( 95 % CI : 40 , 60 ) , with a complete response rate of 4 . 1 % and a partial response rate of 46 % .
The median duration of intracranial response was 6 . 4 months ( range : 1 to 31 months ) .
Of the patients with an intracranial response , 9 % had stable or progressive disease as their best overall response .
14 . 2 Adjuvant Treatment of BRAF V600E or V600K Mutation - Positive Melanoma The safety and efficacy of MEKINIST administered with dabrafenib were evaluated in an international , multicenter , randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial ( COMBI - AD ; NCT01682083 ) that enrolled patients with Stage III melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations as detected by the THxID ® - BRAF assay and pathologic involvement of regional lymph node ( s ) .
Enrollment required complete resection of melanoma with complete lymphadenectomy within 12 weeks prior to randomization .
The trial excluded patients with mucosal or ocular melanoma , unresectable in - transit metastases , distant metastatic disease , or prior systemic anticancer treatment , including radiotherapy .
Patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to receive MEKINIST 2 mg once daily in combination with dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily or two placebos for up to 1 year .
Randomization was stratified by BRAF mutation status ( V600E or V600K ) and American Joint Committee on Cancer ( AJCC ; 7 th Edition ) Stage ( IIIa , IIIb , or IIIc ) .
The major efficacy outcome measure was relapse - free survival ( RFS ) defined as the time from randomization to disease recurrence ( local , regional , or distant metastasis ) , new primary melanoma , or death from any cause , whichever occurred first as assessed by the investigator .
Patients underwent imaging for tumor recurrence every 3 months for the first two years and every 6 months thereafter .
In COMBI - AD , a total of 870 patients were randomized : 438 to the MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib and 432 to placebo .
Median age was 51 years ( range : 18 to 89 ) , 55 % were male , 99 % were white , and 91 % had an ECOG performance status of 0 .
Disease characteristics were AJCC Stage IIIa ( 18 % ) , Stage IIIb ( 41 % ) , Stage IIIc ( 40 % ) , stage unknown ( 1 % ) ; BRAF V600E mutation ( 91 % ) , BRAF V600K mutation ( 9 % ) ; macroscopic lymph nodes ( 65 % ) ; and tumor ulceration ( 41 % ) .
The median duration of follow - up ( time from randomization to last contact or death ) was 2 . 8 years .
COMBI - AD showed a statistically significant improvement in RFS in patients randomized to MEKINIST in combination with dabrafenib arm compared to those randomized to placebo .
Efficacy results are presented in Table 19 and Figure 3 .

Key eligibility criteria were locally confirmed BRAF V600E mutation - positive metastatic NSCLC , no prior exposure to BRAF or MEK inhibitor , and absence of EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement ( unless patients had progression on prior tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy ) .
Patients enrolled in Cohorts A and B were required to have received at least one previous platinum - based chemotherapy regimen with demonstrated disease progression but no more than three prior systemic regimens .
Patients in Cohort C could not have received prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease .
Patients in Cohort A received dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily .
Patients in Cohorts B and C received MEKINIST 2 mg once daily and dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily .
The major efficacy outcome was ORR per RECIST v1 . 1 as assessed by independent review committee ( IRC ) and duration of response .
There were a total of 171 patients enrolled , which included 78 patients enrolled in Cohort A , 57 patients enrolled in Cohort B , and 36 patients enrolled in Cohort C .
The characteristics of the population were : a median age of 66 years ; 48 % male ; 81 % white , 14 % Asian , 3 % black , and 2 % Hispanic ; 60 % former smokers , 32 % never smokers , and 8 % current smokers ; 27 % had ECOG performance status ( PS ) of 0 , 63 % had ECOG PS of 1 , and 11 % had ECOG PS of 2 ; 99 % had metastatic disease of which 6 % had brain metastasis at baseline and 14 % had liver metastasis at baseline ; 11 % had systemic anti - cancer therapy in the adjuvant setting , 58 % of the 135 previously treated patients had only one line of prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease ; 98 % had non - squamous histology .
