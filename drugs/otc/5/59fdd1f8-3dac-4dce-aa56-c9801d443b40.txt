( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities ( ARIA ) : Enhanced clinical vigilance for ARIA is recommended during the first 8 doses of treatment with ADUHELM , particularly during titration .
If a patient experiences symptoms which could be suggestive of ARIA , clinical evaluation should be performed , including MRI testing if indicated .
( 2 . 3 , 5 . 1 ) • Hypersensitivity Reactions : Angioedema and urticaria have occurred .
If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs , promptly discontinue the infusion of ADUHELM and initiate appropriate therapy .
( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities ADUHELM can cause amyloid related imaging abnormalities - edema ( ARIA - E ) , which can be observed on MRI as brain edema or sulcal effusions , and amyloid related imaging abnormalities - hemosiderin deposition ( ARIA - H ) , which includes microhemorrhage and superficial siderosis .
The safety of ADUHELM in patients with 10 or more brain microhemorrhages , any pre - treatment localized superficial siderosis , and / or with a brain hemorrhage greater than 1 cm within one year of treatment initiation has not been established .
In clinical studies of ADUHELM , the severity of ARIA was classified by radiographic criteria , as shown in Table 4 .
Table 4 : ARIA MRI Classification Criteria ARIA Type Radiographic Severity Mild Moderate Severe ARIA - E FLAIR hyperintensity confined to sulcus and or cortex / subcortical white matter in one location < 5 cm FLAIR hyperintensity 5 to 10 cm , or more than 1 site of involvement , each measuring < 10 cm FLAIR hyperintensity measuring > 10 cm , often with significant subcortical white matter and / or sulcal involvement .
One or more separate sites of involvement may be noted .
ARIA - H microhemorrhage ≤ 4 new incident microhemorrhages 5 to 9 new incident microhemorrhages 10 or more new incident microhemorrhages ARIA - H superficial siderosis 1 focal area of superficial siderosis 2 focal areas of superficial siderosis > 2 focal areas of superficial siderosis In Studies 1 and 2 , ARIA ( - E and / or - H ) was observed in 41 % of patients treated with ADUHELM with a planned dose of 10 mg / kg ( 454 out of 1105 ) , compared to 10 % of patients on placebo ( 111 out of 1087 ) .
ARIA - E was observed in 35 % of patients treated with ADUHELM 10 mg / kg , compared to 3 % of patients on placebo .
In Studies 1 and 2 , 16 % of patients in the ADUHELM 10 mg / kg group were apolipoprotein E ε4 ( ApoE ε4 ) homozygotes , 51 % were heterozygotes , and 32 % were noncarriers .
In these studies , randomization was stratified by ApoE ε4 carrier status ( i . e . , carrier or noncarrier ) ; therefore , interpretation of analyses by ApoE ε4 homozygous and heterozygous carrier status should consider the limitations of the unbalanced subgroups and the small number of homozygotes enrolled in the study .
The incidence of ARIA - E was higher in ApoE ε4 carriers than in ApoE ε4 non - carriers ( 64 % in homozygotes , 35 % in heterozygotes , and 20 % in noncarriers ) .
Severe radiographic ARIA - E occurred in 11 % of homozygotes , 4 % of heterozygotes , and 2 % of noncarriers .
However , the incidence of serious adverse reactions with ARIA - E , including risk of death , persistent or significant disability or incapacity , hospitalization , or other medically important event that may require intervention to prevent serious outcomes , was similar for ApoE ε4 carriers and noncarriers ( 2 % in homozygotes , 1 % in heterozygotes , 2 % in noncarriers ) .
The recommendations on management of ARIA do not differ between ApoE ε4 carriers and noncarriers [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Testing for ApoE ε4 carrier status may be considered when initiating treatment with ADUHELM to inform the risk of developing ARIA .
The majority of ARIA - E radiographic events occurred early in treatment ( within the first 8 doses ) , although ARIA can occur at any time .
Among patients treated with a planned dose of ADUHELM 10 mg / kg who had ARIA - E , the maximum radiographic severity was mild in 30 % , moderate in 58 % , and severe in 13 % of patients .
Resolution occurred in 68 % of ARIA - E patients by 12 weeks , 91 % by 20 weeks , and 98 % overall after detection .
10 % of all patients who received ADUHELM 10 mg / kg had more than one episode of ARIA - E , and 1 % had three or more episodes of ARIA - E .
ARIA - H in the setting of ARIA - E associated with the use of ADUHELM 10 mg / kg was observed in 21 % of patients treated with ADUHELM 10 mg / kg , compared to 1 % of patients on placebo .
There was no imbalance in isolated ARIA - H ( i . e . , ARIA - H in patients who did not also experience ARIA - E ) between ADUHELM and placebo .
Intracerebral hemorrhage greater than 1 cm in diameter was reported in 0 . 5 % of patients after treatment with ADUHELM 10 mg / kg compared to 0 . 4 % of patients on placebo .
Patients were excluded from enrollment in Studies 1 and 2 for the following criteria : prior intracerebral hemorrhage greater than 1 cm in diameter , more than 4 microhemorrhages , superficial siderosis , history of diffuse white matter disease , and use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications other than 325 mg or less daily of aspirin .
Although patients were allowed to receive aspirin in daily doses of 325 mg or less , some patients , because of intercurrent medical events that occurred after enrollment and required treatment , received aspirin in doses greater than 325 mg , other antiplatelet drugs , or anticoagulants during Studies 1 and 2 .
In patients treated with 10 mg / kg ADUHELM during the placebo - controlled portion of the studies , those who received any antithrombotic medication ( aspirin at any dose , other antiplatelet drugs , or anticoagulants ; n = 435 ) did not have an increased risk for ARIA or intracerebral hemorrhage when compared with those who did not receive any antithrombotic medication ( n = 670 ) .
The majority of exposures to antithrombotic medications were to aspirin ; 77 patients were exposed to other antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants , limiting any definitive conclusions about the risk of ARIA or intracerebral hemorrhage in patients taking other antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants .
Clinical symptoms were present in 24 % of patients treated with ADUHELM 10 mg / kg who had an observation of ARIA ( - E and / or - H ) , compared to 5 % of patients on placebo .
The most common symptom in patients treated with ADUHELM 10 mg / kg with ARIA was headache ( 13 % ) .
Other frequent symptoms were confusion / delirium / altered mental status / disorientation ( 5 % ) , dizziness / vertigo ( 4 % ) , visual disturbance ( 2 % ) , and nausea ( 2 % ) .
Serious symptoms associated with ARIA were reported in 0 . 3 % of patients treated with ADUHELM 10 mg / kg .
Overall , recurrent episodes of ARIA - E were less frequently symptomatic ( 12 % ) compared with initial episodes of ARIA - E ( 25 % ) .
Clinical symptoms associated with ARIA resolved in the majority of patients ( 88 % ) during the period of observation .
Seizure , including status epilepticus , which can be serious and life - threatening , has been associated with ARIA .
The overall incidence of seizure , independent of ARIA , was 0 . 5 % in the 10 mg / kg ADUHELM group and 0 . 8 % in the placebo group in Studies 1 and 2 .
In patients with ARIA in the 10 mg / kg ADUHELM group , the incidence of seizure was 0 . 7 % .
Status epilepticus was reported in the placebo - controlled and long - term extension studies in patients treated with ADUHELM .
Monitoring and Management Monitoring for ARIA - E and ARIA - H Obtain recent ( within one year ) baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) prior to initiating treatment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Enhanced clinical vigilance for ARIA is recommended during the first 8 doses of treatment with ADUHELM , particularly during titration , as this is the time the majority of ARIA was observed in Studies 1 and 2 .
If a patient experiences symptoms suggestive of ARIA , clinical evaluation should be performed , including MRI testing if indicated .
If ARIA is observed on MRI , careful clinical evaluation should be performed prior to continuing treatment ( see Management ) .
Obtain brain MRIs prior to the 5 th infusion ( first dose of 6 mg / kg ) , 7 th infusion ( first dose of 10 mg / kg ) , 9 th infusion ( third dose of 10 mg / kg ) , and 12 th infusion ( sixth dose of 10 mg / kg ) of ADUHELM to evaluate for the presence of asymptomatic ARIA .
For patients with radiographic findings of ARIA , enhanced clinical vigilance is recommended .
Additional MRIs may be considered if clinically indicated .
ARIA - E Management In Studies 1 and 2 , dosing was suspended for symptomatic patients with ARIA - E of any severity and for asymptomatic patients with moderate or severe ARIA - E .
There is limited experience in patients who continued dosing through symptomatic ARIA - E or through asymptomatic moderate or severe ARIA - E .
Recommendations for dosing in patients with ARIA - E are dependent on clinical symptoms and radiographic severity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
There is limited data in dosing patients who experienced three or more episodes of ARIA - E .
Use clinical judgment in considering whether to continue dosing in patients with recurrent ARIA - E ( more than two episodes ) .
ARIA - H Management In Studies 1 and 2 , dosing was suspended for symptomatic patients with ARIA - H of any severity and for asymptomatic patients with moderate ARIA - H .
Dosing was permanently discontinued for any severe ARIA - H .
Recommendations for dosing in patients with ARIA - H are dependent on the type of ARIA - H and radiographic severity [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Angioedema and urticaria were reported in one patient in the placebo - controlled period of Studies 1 and 2 , and occurred during the ADUHELM infusion .
Promptly discontinue the infusion upon the first observation of any signs or symptoms consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction , and initiate appropriate therapy .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling : • Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] Most common adverse reactions ( at least 10 % and higher incidence compared to placebo ) : ARIA - Edema , headache , ARIA - H microhemorrhage , ARIA - H superficial siderosis , and fall .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
The safety of ADUHELM has been evaluated in 3 , 078 patients who received at least one dose of ADUHELM .
In two placebo - controlled studies ( Studies 1 and 2 ) in patients with Alzheimer ' s disease , a total of 1105 patients received ADUHELM 10 mg / kg [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Of these 1105 patients , approximately 52 % were female , 76 % were White , 10 % were Asian , and 3 % were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity .
The mean age at study entry was 70 years ( range from 50 to 85 ) .
In the combined placebo - controlled and long - term extension periods of Studies 1 and 2 , 834 patients received at least one dose of ADUHELM 10 mg / kg once monthly for at least 6 months , 551 patients for at least 12 months , and 309 patients for at least 18 months .
In the combined placebo - controlled and long - term extension periods , 5 % ( 66 out of 1386 ) of patients in the 10 mg / kg dose group withdrew from the study because of an adverse reaction .
The most common adverse reaction resulting in study withdrawal in the combined placebo - controlled and long - term extension periods was ARIA - H superficial siderosis .
Table 5 shows adverse reactions that were reported in at least 2 % of patients treated with ADUHELM and at least 2 % more frequently than in patients on placebo .

The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other aducanumab products may be misleading .
The immunogenicity of ADUHELM has been evaluated using an in vitro assay for the detection of binding anti - aducanumab - avwa antibodies .
In up to 41 months of treatment in the combined placebo - controlled and long - term extension periods of Studies 1 and 2 , up to 0 . 6 % ( 15 / 2689 ) of patients receiving ADUHELM once monthly developed anti - aducanumab - avwa antibodies .
Based on the limited number of patients who tested positive for anti - aducanumab - avwa antibodies , no observations were made concerning a potential effect of neutralizing activity of anti - aducanumab - avwa antibodies on exposure or efficacy ; however , the available data are too limited to make definitive conclusions regarding an effect on pharmacokinetics , safety , or efficacy of ADUHELM .
Quantification of neutralizing anti - aducanumab - avwa antibodies has not been assessed .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate data on ADUHELM use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug - associated risk of major birth defects , miscarriage , or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
Data Animal Data Intravenous administration of aducanumab - avwa ( 0 , 100 , 300 , or 1000 mg / kg / week ) to female rats through organogenesis had no adverse effect on embryofetal development .
Intravenous administration of aducanumab - avwa ( 0 , 100 , 300 , or 1000 mg / kg / week ) to female rats throughout pregnancy and lactation had no adverse effects on pre - or postnatal development .
The relevance of these data to humans is limited because aggregated amyloid beta , the pharmacological target of aducanumab - avwa , is not present in rat .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of aducanumab - avwa in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects of the drug on milk production .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for ADUHELM and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ADUHELM or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In Studies 1 and 2 , the age of patients ranged from 50 to 85 years , with a mean age of 70 years ; 79 % were 65 and older , and 32 % were 75 and older .
There were no notable differences in the incidence of adverse reactions between these age groups , and no additional safety concerns in patients 65 years of age and older compared to younger patients .
11 DESCRIPTION Aducanumab - avwa is a recombinant human immunoglobulin gamma 1 ( IgG1 ) monoclonal antibody directed against aggregated soluble and insoluble forms of amyloid beta , and is expressed in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line .
Aducanumab - avwa has an approximate molecular weight of 146 kDa .
ADUHELM ( aducanumab - avwa ) injection is a preservative - free , sterile , clear to opalescent , and colorless to yellow solution for intravenous infusion after dilution supplied in single - dose vials available in concentrations of 170 mg / 1 . 7 mL ( 100 mg / mL ) or 300 mg / 3 mL ( 100 mg / mL ) of ADUHELM .
Each mL of solution contains 100 mg of aducanumab - avwa and L - arginine hydrochloride ( 31 . 60 mg ) , L - histidine ( 0 . 60 mg ) , L - histidine hydrochloride monohydrate ( 3 . 39 mg ) , L - methionine ( 1 . 49 mg ) , polysorbate 80 ( 0 . 50 mg ) , and Water for Injection at an approximate pH of 5 . 5 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Aducanumab - avwa is a human , immunoglobulin gamma 1 ( IgG1 ) monoclonal antibody directed against aggregated soluble and insoluble forms of amyloid beta .
The accumulation of amyloid beta plaques in the brain is a defining pathophysiological feature of Alzheimer ' s disease .
ADUHELM reduces amyloid beta plaques , as evaluated in Studies 1 , 2 , and 3 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Effect of ADUHELM on Amyloid Beta Pathology ADUHELM reduced amyloid beta plaque in a dose - and time - dependent manner in Study 1 , Study 2 , and Study 3 , compared with placebo [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The effect of ADUHELM on amyloid beta plaque levels in the brain was evaluated using PET imaging ( 18 F - florbetapir tracer ) .
The PET signal was quantified using the Standard Uptake Value Ratio ( SUVR ) method to estimate brain levels of amyloid beta plaque in composites of brain areas expected to be widely affected by Alzheimer ' s disease pathology ( frontal , parietal , lateral temporal , sensorimotor , and anterior and posterior cingulate cortices ) , compared to a brain region expected to be spared of such pathology ( cerebellum ) .
The SUVR was also expressed on the Centiloid scale .
In substudies of Study 1 and Study 2 , ADUHELM reduced amyloid beta plaque levels in the brain , producing reductions at both ADUHELM low dose and high dose levels and at both Weeks 26 and 78 ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , compared to placebo .
The magnitude of reduction was time - and dose - dependent .
In the long - term extension of Study 1 and Study 2 , a continued decrease in brain amyloid beta plaque levels was observed at Week 132 in patients initially randomized to ADUHELM .
In Study 3 , ADUHELM reduced amyloid beta plaque levels in the brain , producing statistically significant dose - and time - dependent reductions compared to placebo in the 3 mg / kg , 6 mg / kg , and 10 mg / kg ADUHELM treatment groups at Week 26 , and in all ADUHELM treatment groups at Week 54 .
Among those dosed with ADUHELM during the placebo - controlled period in Study 3 , amyloid beta plaque levels in the brain continued to decline in a time - and dose - dependent manner in the long - term extension period through Week 222 .
Effect of ADUHELM on Tau Pathophysiology ADUHELM reduced markers of tau pathophysiology ( CSF p - Tau and Tau PET ) and neurodegeneration ( CSF t - Tau ) in Study 1 and Study 2 [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
ADUHELM reduced CSF levels of p - Tau in substudies conducted in Study 1 and Study 2 .
The adjusted mean change from baseline in CSF p - Tau levels relative to placebo was in favor of the ADUHELM low ( p < 0 . 01 ) and high ( p < 0 . 001 ) dose groups at Week 78 in Study 1 .
Results in Study 2 numerically favored ADUHELM but were not statistically significant .
ADUHELM reduced CSF levels of t - Tau in substudies conducted in Study 1 and Study 2 .
The adjusted mean change from baseline in CSF t - Tau levels relative to placebo was in favor of the ADUHELM low ( p < 0 . 05 ) and high ( p < 0 . 01 ) dose groups at Week 78 in Study 1 .
Results in Study 2 numerically favored ADUHELM but were not statistically significant .
Substudies were conducted in both Study 1 and Study 2 to evaluate the effect of ADUHELM on neurofibrillary tangles composed of tau protein using PET imaging ( 18 F - MK6240 tracer ) .
The PET signal was quantified using the SUVR method to estimate brain levels of tau in brain regions expected to be affected by Alzheimer ' s disease pathology ( medial temporal , temporal , frontal , cingulate , parietal , and occipital cortices ) in the study population compared to a brain region expected to be spared of such pathology ( cerebellum ) .
Data from the substudies were pooled , comprising 37 patients with longitudinal follow - up .
The adjusted mean change from baseline in tau PET SUVR relative to placebo at follow - up was in favor of ADUHELM high dose in the medial temporal ( p < 0 . 001 ) , temporal ( p < 0 . 05 ) , and frontal ( p < 0 . 05 ) brain regions .
No statistically significant differences were observed for the cingulate , parietal , or occipital cortices .
Exposure - Response Relationships Model based exposure - response analyses for Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that higher exposures to ADUHELM were associated with greater reduction in clinical decline on CDR - SB , ADAS - Cog13 , and ADCS - ADL - MCI .
In addition , higher exposures to ADUHELM were associated with greater reduction in amyloid beta plaque in Studies 1 and 2 .
An association between reduction in amyloid beta plaque and clinical decline on CDR - SB was also observed .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of ADUHELM were characterized using a population PK analysis with concentration data collected from 2961 subjects with Alzheimer ' s disease who received ADUHELM in single or multiple doses .
Steady - state concentrations of ADUHELM were reached by 16 weeks of repeated dosing with an every 4 - week regimen , and the systemic accumulation was 1 . 7 - fold .
The peak concentration ( Cmax ) , trough concentration ( Cmin ) , and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve at steady state ( AUCss ) of ADUHELM increased dose proportionally in the dose range of 1 to 10 mg / kg every 4 weeks .
Distribution The mean value ( 95 % CI ) for volume of distribution at steady state is 9 . 63 L ( 9 . 48 , 9 . 79 ) .
Elimination ADUHELM is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous IgG .
ADUHELM clearance ( 95 % CI ) is 0 . 0159 ( 0 . 0156 , 0 . 0161 ) L / hr .
The terminal half - life is 24 . 8 ( 14 . 8 , 37 . 9 ) days .
Specific Populations Body weight , age , sex , and race were found to impact exposure to ADUHELM .
However , none of these covariates were found to be clinically significant .
Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment No studies were conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ADUHELM in patients with renal or hepatic impairment .
ADUHELM is not expected to undergo renal elimination or metabolism by hepatic enzymes .

Impairment of Fertility Intravenous administration of aducanumab - avwa ( 0 , 100 , 300 , or 1000 mg / kg / week ) to male and female rats prior to and during mating and continuing in females to gestation day 7 resulted in no adverse effects on fertility or reproductive performance .
The relevance of these data to humans is limited because aggregated amyloid beta , the pharmacological target of aducanumab - avwa , is not present in rat .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of ADUHELM was evaluated in two double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled , parallel group studies ( Study 1 , NCT 02484547 and Study 2 , NCT 02477800 ) in patients with Alzheimer ' s disease ( patients with confirmed presence of amyloid pathology and mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of disease , consistent with Stage 3 and Stage 4 Alzheimer ' s disease , stratified to include 80 % Stage 3 patients and 20 % Stage 4 patients ) .
The effects of ADUHELM were also supported by a double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled , dose - ranging study ( Study 3 , NCT 01677572 ) in patients with Alzheimer ' s disease ( patients with confirmed presence of amyloid pathology and prodromal or mild dementia stage of disease , consistent with Stage 3 and Stage 4 Alzheimer ' s disease , with an enrolled distribution of 43 % Stage 3 patients and 57 % Stage 4 patients ) , followed by an optional , dose - blind , long - term extension period .
In Studies 1 and 2 , patients were randomized to receive ADUHELM low dose ( 3 or 6 mg / kg for ApoE ε4 carriers and noncarriers , respectively ) , ADUHELM high dose ( 10 mg / kg ) , or placebo every 4 weeks for 18 months , followed by an optional , dose - blind , long - term extension period .
Both studies included an initial titration period of up to 6 months to the maximum target dose .
At the beginning of the study , ApoE ε4 carriers were initially titrated up to a maximum of 6 mg / kg in the high dose group , which was later adjusted to 10 mg / kg .
In Studies 1 and 2 , patients were enrolled with a Clinical Dementia Rating ( CDR ) global score of 0 . 5 , a Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status ( RBANS ) delayed memory index score ≤ 85 , and a Mini - Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) score of 24 - 30 .
In Study 3 , patients were enrolled with a global CDR score of 0 . 5 or 1 . 0 and an MMSE score of 20 - 30 .
Patients were enrolled with or without concomitant approved therapies ( cholinesterase inhibitors and the N - methyl - D - aspartate antagonist memantine ) for Alzheimer ' s disease .
Studies 1 and 2 were terminated prior to their planned completion .
Study endpoints were analyzed based on the prespecified statistical analysis plan .
Study 1 In Study 1 , 1638 patients were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to receive ADUHELM low dose , ADUHELM high dose , or placebo .
At baseline , the mean age of patients was 71 years , with a range of 50 to 85 years .
A subgroup of 488 patients were enrolled in the amyloid PET substudy ; of these , 302 were evaluated at week 78 .
Results from the amyloid beta PET and CSF biomarker substudies are described in Figure 1 and Table 6 .

In Study 1 , treatment with ADUHELM high dose demonstrated reduced clinical decline , as evidenced by a statistically significant treatment effect on change from baseline in CDR - SB compared to placebo ( - 0 . 39 [ - 22 % ] , p = 0 . 0120 ) , as shown in Figure 2 and Table 7 .
The estimate of the treatment effect favored ADUHELM across all prespecified subgroups of interest .
Figure 2 : Line Plot of Primary Efficacy Endpoint ( Change From Baseline in CDR Sum of Boxes ) in Study 1 [ MULTIMEDIA ] * p < 0 . 05 Secondary efficacy endpoints included the change from baseline in MMSE score at Week 78 , the change from baseline in the Alzheimer ' s Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale ( 13 items ) ( ADAS - Cog 13 ) at Week 78 , and the change from baseline in the Alzheimer ' s Disease Cooperative Study – Activities of Daily Living Inventory ( Mild Cognitive Impairment version ) ( ADCS - ADL - MCI ) score at Week 78 .
In Study 1 , statistically significant differences from placebo were observed in the ADUHELM high dose group on all secondary efficacy endpoints evaluated .
The estimate of the treatment effect favored ADUHELM across most prespecified subgroups of interest for the secondary efficacy endpoints .
The Neuropsychiatric Inventory - 10 item ( NPI - 10 ) was the only tertiary endpoint that assessed efficacy .
The results of the high dose group , compared to placebo , are presented in Table 7 .
Differences from placebo observed in the ADUHELM low dose group numerically favored ADUHELM but were not statistically significant .
