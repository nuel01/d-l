4 CONTRAINDICATIONS NUZYRA is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to omadacycline or tetracycline - class antibacterial drugs , or to any of the excipients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Known hypersensitivity to omadacycline , tetracycline - class antibacterial drugs or any of the excipients in NUZYRA ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Mortality Imbalance in Patients with CABP : In the CABP trial , mortality rate of 2 % was observed in NUZYRA - treated patients compared to 1 % in moxifloxacin - treated patients .
The cause of the mortality imbalance has not been established .
Closely monitor clinical response to therapy in CABP patients , particularly in those at higher risk for mortality .
( 5 . 1 , 6 . 1 ) • Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia : The use of NUZYRA during tooth development ( last half of pregnancy , infancy and childhood to the age of 8 years ) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth ( yellow - gray - brown ) and enamel hypoplasia .
( 5 . 2 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 4 ) • Inhibition of Bone Growth : The use of NUZYRA during the second and third trimester of pregnancy , infancy and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth .
( 5 . 3 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 4 ) .
• Clostridioides difficile - associated diarrhea : Evaluate if diarrhea occurs .
( 5 . 5 ) 5 . 1 Mortality Imbalance in Patients with Community - Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia Mortality imbalance was observed in the CABP clinical trial with eight deaths ( 2 % ) occurring in patients treated with NUZYRA compared to four deaths ( 1 % ) in patients treated with moxifloxacin .
The cause of the mortality imbalance has not been established .
All deaths , in both treatment arms , occurred in patients > 65 years of age ; most patients had multiple comorbidities [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 5 ) ] .
The causes of death varied and included worsening and / or complications of infection and underlying conditions .
Closely monitor clinical response to therapy in CABP patients , particularly in those at higher risk for mortality [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 2 Tooth Discoloration and Enamel Hypoplasia The use of NUZYRA during tooth development ( last half of pregnancy , infancy , and childhood up to the age of 8 years ) may cause permanent discoloration of the teeth ( yellow - gray - brown ) .
This adverse reaction is more common during long - term use of the tetracycline class drugs , but it has been observed following repeated short - term courses .
Enamel hypoplasia has also been reported with tetracycline class drugs .
Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if NUZYRA is used during the second or third trimester of pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 3 Inhibition of Bone Growth The use of NUZYRA during the second and third trimester of pregnancy , infancy and childhood up to the age of 8 years may cause reversible inhibition of bone growth .
All tetracyclines form a stable calcium complex in any bone - forming tissue .
A decrease in fibula growth rate has been observed in premature infants given oral tetracycline in doses of 25 mg / kg every 6 hours .
This reaction was shown to be reversible when the drug was discontinued .
Advise the patient of the potential risk to the fetus if NUZYRA is used during the second or third trimester of pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 4 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with NUZYRA [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Life - threatening hypersensitivity ( anaphylactic ) reactions have been reported with other tetracycline - class antibacterial drugs .
NUZYRA is structurally similar to other tetracycline - class antibacterial drugs and is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline - class antibacterial drugs [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Discontinue NUZYRA if an allergic reaction occurs .
5 . 5 Clostridioides difficile - Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile - associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibacterial drug use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibacterial drug use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibacterial drug treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
5 . 6 Tetracycline Class Effects NUZYRA is structurally similar to tetracycline - class of antibacterial drugs and may have similar adverse reactions .
Adverse reactions including photosensitivity , pseudotumor cerebri , and anti - anabolic action which has led to increased BUN , azotemia , acidosis , hyperphosphatemia , pancreatitis , and abnormal liver function tests , have been reported for other tetracycline - class antibacterial drugs , and may occur with NUZYRA .
Discontinue NUZYRA if any of these adverse reactions are suspected .
5 . 7 Development of Drug - Resistant Bacteria Prescribing NUZYRA in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 . 3 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described in greater detail in the Warnings and Precautions section of labeling : • Mortality Imbalance in Patients with Community - Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • Tooth Development and Enamel Hypoplasia [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Inhibition of Bone Growth [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] • Hypersensitivity Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] • Tetracycline Class Effects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ] The most common adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 2 % ) are nausea , vomiting , infusion site reactions , alanine aminotransferase increased , aspartate aminotransferase increased , gamma - glutamyl transferase increased , hypertension , headache , diarrhea , insomnia , and constipation .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Overview of the Safety Evaluation of NUZYRA NUZYRA was evaluated in three Phase 3 clinical trials ( Trial 1 , Trial 2 and Trial 3 ) .
These trials included a single Phase 3 trial in CABP patients ( Trial 1 ) and two Phase 3 trials in ABSSSI patients ( Trial 2 and Trial 3 ) .
Across all Phase 3 trials , a total of 1073 patients were treated with NUZYRA ( 382 patients in Trial 1 and 691 in Trials 2 and 3 of which 368 patients were treated with only oral NUZYRA .
Clinical Trial Experience in Patients with Community - Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia Trial 1 was a Phase 3 CABP trial that enrolled 774 adult patients , 386 randomized to NUZYRA ( 382 received at least one dose of NUZYRA and 4 patients did not receive the study drug ) and 388 randomized to moxifloxacin ( all 388 received at least one dose of moxifloxacin ) .

Selected Adverse Reactions Occurring in Less Than 2 % of Patients Receiving NUZYRA in Trials 1 , 2 and 3 The following selected adverse reactions were reported in NUZYRA - treated patients at a rate of less than 2 % in Trials 1 , 2 and 3 .
Cardiovascular System Disorders : tachycardia , atrial fibrillation Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : anemia , thrombocytosis Ear and Labyrinth Disorders : vertigo Gastrointestinal Disorders : abdominal pain , dyspepsia General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : fatigue Immune System Disorders : hypersensitivity Infections and Infestations : oral candidiasis , vulvovaginal mycotic infection Investigations : creatinine phosphokinase increased , bilirubin increased , lipase increased , alkaline phosphatase increased Nervous System Disorders : dysgeusia , lethargy Respiratory , Thoracic , and Mediastinal disorders : oropharyngeal pain Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : pruritus , erythema , hyperhidrosis , urticaria 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage while taking NUZYRA .
( 7 . 1 ) • Absorption of tetracyclines , including NUZYRA is impaired by antacids containing aluminum , calcium , or magnesium , bismuth subsalicylate and iron containing preparations .
( 2 . 1 , 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Anticoagulant Drugs Because tetracyclines have been shown to depress plasma prothrombin activity , patients who are on anticoagulant therapy may require downward adjustment of their anticoagulant dosage while also taking NUZYRA .
7 . 2 Antacids and Iron Preparations Absorption of oral tetracyclines , including NUZYRA , is impaired by antacids containing aluminum , calcium , or magnesium , bismuth subsalicylate , and iron containing preparations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with NUZYRA .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary NUZYRA , like other tetracycline - class antibacterial drugs , may cause discoloration of deciduous teeth and reversible inhibition of bone growth when administered during the second and third trimester of pregnancy [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 , 5 . 3 ) , Data , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
The limited available data of NUZYRA use in pregnant women is insufficient to inform drug associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriages .
Animal studies indicate that administration of omadacycline during the period of organogenesis resulted in fetal loss and / or congenital malformations in pregnant rats and rabbits at 7 times and 3 times the mean AUC exposure , respectively , of the clinical intravenous dose of 100 - mg and the oral dose of 300 - mg .
Reductions in fetal weight occurred in rats at all administered doses ( see Data ) .
In a fertility study , administration to rats during mating and early pregnancy resulted in embryo loss at 20 mg / kg / day ; systemic exposure based on AUC was approximately equal to the clinical exposure level [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Results of studies in rats with omadacycline have shown tooth discoloration .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4 % and 15 - 20 % .
Data Animal Data Intravenous infusion of omadacycline to pregnant rats during organogenesis ( gestation days 6 - 17 ) at doses of 5 to 80 mg / kg / day resulted in maternal lethality at 80 mg / kg / day .
Increased embryo - fetal lethality and fetal malformations ( whole body edema ) occurred at 60 mg / kg / day ( 7 times the clinical AUC ) , dose - dependent reductions in fetal body weight occurred at all doses , and delayed skeletal ossification occurred at doses as low as 10 mg / kg / day ( Systemic exposure based on AUC at a similar dose in unmated female rats in a separate study was approximately half the clinical exposure ) .
In pregnant rabbits , intravenous infusion of 5 , 10 or 20 mg / kg / day during organogenesis ( gestation days 7 - 18 ) resulted in maternal lethality and body weight loss at 20 mg / kg / day .
Embryo - fetal lethality , congenital malformations of the skeleton , and reduced fetal weight also occurred at 20 mg / kg / day ( 7 times the clinical AUC ) .
Cardiac and lung malformations were present in dose - related incidence at 10 and 20 mg / kg / day .
The fetal no - adverse - effect - level in the rabbit embryo - fetal development study was 5 mg / kg / day , at approximately 1 . 2 times the clinical steady state AUC .
Intravenous infusion of omadacycline to pregnant and lactating rats at doses of 7 . 5 , 15 and 30 mg / kg / day did not adversely affect survival , growth ( other than lower pup body weights and / or gains at the high dose that were only statistically significant at sporadic intervals ) , postnatal development , behavior , or reproductive capability of offspring at maternal doses up to 30 mg / kg / day ( approximately equivalent to 3 times the IV clinical dose of 100 mg / day , based on doses normalized for total body surface area ) , the highest dose tested , although dosing was discontinued early in a number of animals in this group due to injection site intolerance .
Results of animal studies indicate that tetracyclines cross the placenta , are found in fetal tissues , and can have toxic effects on the developing fetus ( often related to retardation of skeletal development ) .
Evidence of embryotoxicity also has been noted in animals treated early in pregnancy .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of omadacycline in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production .
Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk ; however , the extent of absorption of tetracyclines , including omadacycline , by the breastfed infant is not known .
Because there are other antibacterial drug options available to treat CABP and ABSSSI in lactating women and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions , including tooth discoloration and inhibition of bone growth , advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with NUZYRA and for 4 days ( based on half - life ) after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females NUZYRA may produce embryonic or fetal harm [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise patients to use an acceptable form of contraception while taking NUZYRA .
Infertility Males In rat studies , injury to the testis and reduced sperm counts and motility occurred in male rats after treatment with omadacycline [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
Females In rat studies , omadacycline affected fertility parameters in female rats , resulting in reduced ovulation and increased embryonic loss at intended human exposures [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of NUZYRA in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years have not been established .
Due to the adverse effects of the tetracycline - class of drugs , including NUZYRA on tooth development and bone growth , use of NUZYRA in pediatric patients less than 8 years of age is not recommended [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 ) ] 8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients who received NUZYRA in the Phase 3 clinical trials ( n = 1073 ) , 200 patients were ≥ 65 years of age , including 92 patients who were ≥ 75 years of age .
In Trial 1 , numerically lower clinical success rates at early clinical response ( ECR ) timepoint for NUZYRA - treated and moxifloxacin - treated patients ( 75 . 5 % and 78 . 7 % , respectively ) were observed in CABP patients ≥ 65 years of age as compared to patients < 65 years of age ( 85 . 2 % and 86 . 3 % , respectively ) .
Additionally , all deaths in the CABP trial occurred in patients > 65 years of age [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
No significant difference in NUZYRA exposure was observed between healthy elderly subjects and younger subjects following a single 100 - mg IV dose of NUZYRA [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment of NUZYRA is warranted in patients with mild , moderate , or severe hepatic insufficiency ( Child - Pugh classes A , B , or C ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of NUZYRA is warranted in patients with mild , moderate , or severe renal impairment , including patients with end stage renal disease who are receiving hemodialysis [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with NUZYRA .
Following a 100 mg single dose intravenous administration of omadacycline , 8 . 9 % of dose is recovered in the dialysate .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action NUZYRA is an antibacterial drug [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] 12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Electrophysiology Based on the nonclinical and clinical data , including electrocardiogram evaluation in the phase 3 clinical trials , one of which had moxifloxacin as a control group , no clinically relevant QTc prolongation was observed at the maximum recommended dose of omadacycline .
Cardiac Physiology - Increase in Heart Rate In phase 1 studies conducted in healthy volunteers , reversible dose - dependent increases in heart rate have been observed following administration of single and multiple doses of omadacycline .
The clinical implication of this finding is unknown [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
In a standard radiolabeled ligand binding assays , omadacycline was shown to inhibit binding of H - scopolamine to the M2 subtype of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor .
In the heart , muscarinic M2 receptors serve as mediators of the parasympathetic input that normally is received via the vagus nerve and stimulation of the receptor increases membrane potassium conductance through the acetylcholine - dependent channel , which slows depolarization and reduces pacemaker activity in the sinoatrial node .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetic parameters of NUZYRA after single and multiple oral and intravenous doses are summarized in Table 6 .

Effect of Food Ingestion of a standard high - fat nondairy meal ( 855 calories ; 59 % calories from fat ) and standard high - fat meal including dairy ( 985 calories ; 60 % calories from fat ) 2 - hours before administration of a single 300 - mg oral dose of NUZYRA decreased the rate ( Cmax ) and extent of absorption ( AUC ) by 40 % and 42 % , and 59 % and 63 % , respectively compared to administration of NUZYRA under fasting conditions .
The rate and extent of absorption of NUZYRA were not substantially decreased when a high - fat nondairy meal ( 800 - 1000 calories ; 50 % calories from fat ) was ingested 4 hours pre - dose .
Following ingestion of either a light non - fat ( 300 - 350 calories ; ≤ 5 % calories from fat ) , or a standard low - fat ( 800 - 1000 calories ; 30 % calories from fat ) , or a standard high fat ( 800 - 1000 calories ; 50 % calories from fat ) meal 2 hours post - dose , the AUC and Cmax were not substantially altered , as compared to fasting conditions .
Distribution Plasma protein binding of omadacycline is approximately 20 % and is not concentration dependent .
The mean ( % CV ) volume of distribution of omadacycline at steady - state following IV administration of NUZYRA in healthy subjects was 190 ( 27 . 7 ) L . Elimination Renal clearance of omadacycline following IV administration of NUZYRA ranged from 2 . 4 to 3 . 3 L / h in healthy subjects .
Metabolism In vitro studies using human liver microsomes and hepatocytes demonstrated that omadacycline is not metabolized .
Excretion Following a 100 - mg IV dose of NUZYRA , 27 % of the dose was recovered as unchanged omadacycline in the urine .
In healthy male volunteers receiving 300 - mg oral [ 14 C ] NUZYRA , 77 . 5 % to 84 . 0 % of the dose was recovered in the feces , approximately 14 . 4 % ( range 10 . 8 % to 17 . 4 % ) in the urine , with 95 . 5 % of the administered radioactive dose recovered after 7 days .
Lung Penetration The mean omadacycline concentrations over time for alveolar cells ( AC ) , epithelial lining fluid ( ELF ) , and plasma following IV administration of multiple doses of 100 - mg of NUZYRA to healthy volunteers are shown in Figure 1 .
The steady - state omadacycline AUC0 - 24 h ( 302 . 5 hr * mcg / mL ) in AC was 25 . 8 - fold higher than the plasma AUC0 - 24 h , and the AUC0 - 24 h ( 17 . 2 hr * mcg / mL ) in ELF was 1 . 5 - fold higher than the AUC0 - 24 h in plasma .
Figure 1 : Mean ( ± SD ) Concentrations of Omadacycline in Alveolar Cells , Epithelial Lining , and Plasma Following Multiple 100 mg IV Doses of NUZYRA to Healthy Subjects During Bronchoscopy Sampling Times [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of omadacycline were observed based on age , gender , race , weight , renal impairment or end - stage renal disease , and hepatic impairment .
Patients with Renal Impairment A study was conducted to compare NUZYRA pharmacokinetics following 100 - mg IV administration in 8 subjects with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) on stable hemodialysis , with and 8 - matched healthy control subjects .
In the ESRD subjects , NUZYRA was administered on two separate occasions ; immediately prior to dialysis and after dialysis , and the AUC , Cmax , and CL of NUZYRA were comparable between the renally impaired subjects and the matching healthy subjects .
During dialysis , 7 . 9 % of omadacycline was recovered in the dialysate .
Renal impairment did not impact NUZYRA elimination .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment A study was conducted to compare NUZYRA pharmacokinetics following intravenous and oral dosing to 5 subjects with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class A ) , 6 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class B ) , and 6 subjects with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Class C ) as compared to 12 matched healthy control subjects .
The AUC and Cmax of NUZYRA were comparable between the hepatically impaired subjects and the matching healthy subjects , and similar clearance was observed across all cohorts .
Hepatic impairment did not impact NUZYRA elimination .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies Administration of oral verapamil ( P - gp inhibitor ) two hours prior to a single 300 mg oral dose of NUZYRA increased omadacycline AUC by approximately 25 % and Cmax by approximately 9 % .
In vitro Studies In vitro studies in human liver microsomes indicate that omadacycline does not inhibit nor induce metabolism mediated by CYP 1A1 , 1A2 , 2A6 , 2B6 , 2C8 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , and 3A4 / 5 , or UGT1A1 .
Therefore , NUZYRA is not expected to alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by the above stated human hepatic enzymes .
Omadacycline is not an inhibitor of P - gp and organic anion transporting polypeptide ( OATP ) 1B1 and OATP1B3 .
Omadacycline is a substrate of P - gp ( see Clinical Studies above ) .
Omadacycline is not a substrate or inhibitor of the major organic anion transporters ( OAT - 1 and 3 ) , breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) , or multidrug resistance - associated protein 2 ( MRP2 ) .
Omadacycline was not an OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 substrate at supra - therapeutic concentrations ( 5 - 13 fold higher than clinically relevant concentrations ) .
12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Omadacycline is an aminomethylcycline antibacterial within the tetracycline class of antibacterial drugs .
Omadacycline binds to the 30 S ribosomal subunit and blocks protein synthesis .
In general , omadacycline is considered bacteriostatic ; however , omadacycline has demonstrated bactericidal activity against some isolates of S . pneumoniae and H . influenzae .
Resistance The following in vitro data are available , but their clinical significance is unknown .
Omadacycline was active in vitro against Gram - positive bacteria expressing ribosomal protection proteins ( TetM ) and tetracycline resistance active efflux pumps ( TetK and TetL ) , and in Enterobactericeae expressing the TetB efflux pump .
Additionally , omadacycline was active against some S . aureus , S . pneumoniae , and H . influenzae strains carrying macrolide resistance genes ( ermA , B and / or C ) , or ciprofloxacin resistance genes ( gyrA and parC ) and beta - lactamase positive H . influenzae .
Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In vitro studies have not demonstrated antagonism between omadacycline and other commonly used antibacterials ( ampicillin , ceftazidime , ceftriaxone , imipenem , piperacillin / tazobactam , gentamicin , vancomycin , daptomycin , linezolid ) .
Antimicrobial Activity Omadacycline has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria , both in vitro and in clinical infections [ see Indications and Usage ( 1 . 1 , 1 . 2 ) ] .
Community - Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia ( CABP ) • Gram - positive bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae Staphylococcus aureus ( methicillin - susceptible isolates ) • Gram - negative bacteria Haemophilus influenzae Haemophilus parainfluenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae • Other microorganisms Chlamydophila pneumoniae Legionella pneumophila Mycoplasma pneumoniae Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections ( ABSSSI ) • Gram - positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis Staphylococcus aureus ( methicillin - susceptible and - resistant isolates ) Staphylococcus lugdunensis Streptococcus anginosus grp .
( includes S . anginosus , S . intermedius , and S . constellatus ) Streptococcus pyogenes • Gram - negative bacteria Enterobacter cloacae Klebsiella pneumoniae The following in vitro data are available , but their clinical significance is unknown .
At least 90 % of isolates of the following bacteria exhibit an in - vitro minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for NUZYRA against isolates of similar genus or organism group .
However , the efficacy of NUZYRA in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well controlled clinical trials .
• Gram - positive bacteria Enterococcus faecium ( vancomycin - susceptible and - resistant isolates ) Streptococcus agalactiae • Gram - negative bacteria Enterobacter aerogenes Escherichia coli Citrobacter freundii Citrobacter koseri Klebsiella oxytoca Moraxella catarrhalis Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug , please see : https : / / www . fda . gov / STIC .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies with omadacycline have not been conducted .
However , there has been evidence of oncogenic activity in rats in studies with the related antibacterial drugs , oxytetracycline ( adrenal and pituitary tumors ) , and minocycline ( thyroid tumors ) .
Mutagenesis Omadacycline was positive for clastogenicity and aneugenicity in an in vitro chromosome aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells and for mutagenicity in an in vitro forward mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells .
These effects were seen in the presence of metabolizing enzymes .
Omadacycline was negative in a chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster V79 cells and in vivo micronucleus assays administered intraperitoneally to ICR mice or intravenously to HanRcc : WIST rats .
Impairment of Fertility Omadacycline administration to male rats in a fertility study caused reduced sperm counts and sperm motility at 20 - mg / kg / day ( approximately 1 . 3 times clinical systemic exposure , based on AUC in a separate study in rats at a similar dose ) , but had no effect on male fertility parameters .
In general toxicity studies , inhibition of spermatogenesis occurred after administration of 45 - mg / kg / day omadacycline ( 6 to 8 times the clinical AUC exposure ) for 37 days or longer , but not at lower doses ( 15 - mg / kg / day , ≤ 2 times clinical AUC exposure ) or shorter treatment periods ( 4 weeks or less ) .
In female rats , fertility was reduced at the 20 - mg / kg / day dose ( approximately equivalent to human exposures in a separate study in unmated females ) , characterized by reduced ovulation and increased embryonic loss when treatment occurred from before mating through early pregnancy .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Hyperpigmentation of the thyroid has been produced by members of the tetracycline class in the following species : in rats by omadacycline , oxytetracycline , doxycycline , tetracycline PO4 , and methacycline ; in minipigs by doxycycline , minocycline , tetracycline PO4 , and methacycline ; in dogs by doxycycline and minocycline ; in monkeys by omadacycline and minocycline .
Minocycline , tetracycline PO4 , methacycline , doxycycline , tetracycline base , oxytetracycline HCl , and tetracycline HCl were goitrogenic in rats fed a low iodine diet .
This goitrogenic effect was accompanied by high radioactive iodine uptake .
Administration of minocycline also produced a large goiter with high radioiodine uptake in rats fed a relatively high iodine diet .
Treatment of various animal species with this class of drugs has also resulted in the induction of thyroid hyperplasia in the following : in rats and dogs ( minocycline ) ; in chickens ( chlortetracycline ) ; and in rats and mice ( oxytetracycline ) .
Adrenal gland hyperplasia has been observed in goats and rats treated with oxytetracycline .
