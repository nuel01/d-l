For patients on short - acting somatostatin analogs , a washout period of 2 days is recommended prior to imaging [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Patient Hydration Instruct patients to drink water to ensure adequate hydration prior to administration of Detectnet and to continue to drink and void frequently during the first hours following administration to reduce radiation exposure [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Status Assessment of pregnancy status is recommended in females of reproductive potential before administering Detectnet .
2 . 4 Image Acquisition For Detectnet PET imaging , a whole - body acquisition from the skull vertex to mid - thigh is recommended .
Image acquisition can begin between 45 to 90 minutes after the intravenous administration of Detectnet .
Adapt Detectnet uptake time and scan duration according to the equipment used and the patient and tumor characteristics , to obtain the optimal image quality .
2 . 5 Image Interpretation Copper Cu 64 dotatate binds to somatostatin receptors .
Based upon the intensity of the signals , PET images obtained using copper Cu 64 dotatate injection indicate the presence and density of somatostatin receptors in tissues .
Uptake can also be seen in a variety of non - NET tumors that contain somatostatin receptors or as a normal physiologic variant [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
NET tumors that do not bear somatostatin receptors will not be visualized .
2 . 6 Radiation Dosimetry Estimated radiation absorbed doses per injected activity for organs and tissues of adult patients following an intravenous administration of copper Cu 64 dotatate injection are shown in Table 1 .
Table 1 .
Estimated radiation absorbed dose per injected activity in selected organs with copper Cu 64 dotatate injectionTarget Organ Mean [ 1 ] absorbed dose ( mGy / MBq ) Adrenals 0 . 137 Brain 0 . 013 Breasts 0 . 013 Gallbladder wall 0 . 040 Lower large intestine wall 0 . 043 Small intestine 0 . 066 Stomach wall 0 . 019 Upper large intestine wall 0 . 022 Heart wall 0 . 019 Kidneys 0 . 139 Liver 0 . 161 Lungs 0 . 017 Muscle 0 . 019 Ovaries 0 . 019 Pancreas 0 . 093 Red marrow 0 . 027 Osteogenic cells 0 . 034 Skin 0 . 012 Spleen 0 . 115 Testes 0 . 014 Thymus 0 . 015 Thyroid 0 . 014 Urinary bladder wall 0 . 037 Uterus 0 . 019 Total body 0 . 025 Effective dose ( mSv / MBq ) 0 . 032 [ 1 ] Mean of 5 patients .
The effective radiation dose resulting from the administration of 148 MBq ( 4 mCi ) to an adult is about 4 . 7 mSv .
For an administered activity of 148 MBq ( 4 mCi ) the typical radiation dose to the critical organs , which are the liver , the kidneys / adrenals , and the spleen , are about 24 mGy , 21 mGy and 17 mGy , respectively .
Because the spleen has one of the highest physiological uptakes , higher uptake and radiation dose to other organs or pathologic tissues may occur in patients with splenectomy .

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Radiation Risk : Ensure safe handling and preparation procedures to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure ( 5 . 1 ) .
Advise patients to hydrate before and after administration and to void frequently after administration .
( 2 . 3 ) • Hypersensitivity Reactions : Most reported reactions were rash and pruritus and reversible either spontaneously or with routine symptomatic management .
( 5 . 2 ) • Risk for Image Misinterpretation : Uptake of Detectnet can be seen in a variety of tumor types other than NETs , in other pathologic conditions , and as a normal physiologic variant ( e . g . , uncinate process of the pancreas ) .
( 5 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Radiation Risk Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals , including Detectnet , contribute to a patient ’ s overall long - term cumulative radiation exposure .
Long - term cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer .
Ensure safe handling and preparation procedures to protect patients and health care workers from unintentional radiation exposure .
Advise patients to hydrate before and after administration and to void frequently after administration [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 , 2 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 2 Hypersensitivity Reactions Hypersensitivity reactions following administration of somatostatin receptor imaging agents predominantly consisted of cutaneous reactions such as rash and pruritus .
Reactions reversed either spontaneously or with routine symptomatic management .
Less frequently hypersensitivity reactions included angioedema or cases with features of anaphylaxis .
5 . 3 Risk for Image Misinterpretation The uptake of copper Cu 64 dotatate reflects the level of somatostatin receptor density in NETs , however , uptake can also be seen in a variety of other tumors that also express somatostatin receptors .
Increased uptake might also be seen in other non - cancerous pathologic conditions that express somatostatin receptors including thyroid disease or in subacute inflammation , or might occur as a normal physiologic variant ( e . g . uncinate process of the pancreas ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .
A negative scan after the administration of Detectnet in patients who do not have a history of NET disease does not rule out disease [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .

8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Detectnet have not been established in pediatric patients .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Detectnet did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of a radiation overdose , the absorbed dose to the patient should be reduced where possible by increasing the elimination of the radionuclide from the body by reinforced hydration and frequent bladder voiding .
A diuretic might also be considered .
If possible , estimation of the radioactive dose given to the patient should be performed .

14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy of Detectnet was established in two single - center , open - label studies .
Study 1 prospectively evaluated a total of 63 subjects , including 42 patients with known or suspected NET based on histology , conventional imaging , or clinical evaluations and 21 healthy volunteers .
Of the 42 patients , 37 ( 88 % ) had a history of NETs at the time of Detectnet imaging .
Among the total study population of 63 subjects , 28 ( 44 % ) were men and 35 ( 56 % ) were women with most subjects being white ( 86 % ) .
The mean age of the subjects was 54 years ( range 25 to 82 years ) .
Detectnet images from each subject were interpreted as either positive or negative for NET by three independent readers who were blinded to clinical information and other imaging results .
PET imaging results were compared to a composite reference standard consisting of a single oncologist ’ s blinded assessment of subject diagnosis based on available histopathology results , reports of conventional imaging ( MRI , contrast CT , bone scintigraphy , F 18 fludeoxyglucose PET / CT , F 18 sodium fluoride PET / CT , In 111 pentetreotide SPECT / CT , Ga 68 dotatate PET / CT ) performed within 8 weeks prior to Detectnet imaging , and clinical and laboratory data including chromogranin A and serotonin levels .
The proportion of subjects positive for disease per composite reference who were identified as positive by Detectnet imaging was used to quantify positive percent agreement .
The proportion of subjects without disease per composite reference who were identified as negative by Detectnet imaging was used to quantify negative percent agreement .
