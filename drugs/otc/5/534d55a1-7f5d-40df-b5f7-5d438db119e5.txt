[ 5 ] Based on investigator - reported adverse reactions .
Study 2 and Study 3 Study 2 was a single - arm , multicenter , expanded access trial that enrolled patients with high - risk neuroblastoma ( N = 783 ) .
The reported adverse event profile of Unituxin in Study 2 was similar to that observed in Study 1 .
Study 3 was a multicenter , single - arm safety study of Unituxin in combination with GM - CSF , IL - 2 , and RA .
In Study 3 , adverse events of all CTCAE grades and laboratory data were systematically and comprehensively collected .
Of 104 patients enrolled and treated in Study 3 , 77 % of patients completed study therapy .
In general , the adverse reaction profile of Unituxin observed in Study 3 was similar to that observed in Study 1 and Study 2 .
The following adverse reactions not previously reported in Study 1 were reported in at least 10 % of patients in Study 3 : nasal congestion ( 20 % ) and wheezing ( 15 % ) .
Table 7 provides the per - patient incidence of laboratory abnormalities in Study 3 .

[ 2 ] Based on CTCAE version 4 . 0 .
[ 3 ] Urinalysis results were reported as positive or negative without assessment of grade .
6 . 2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins , there is a potential for immunogenicity .
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors , including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other products may be misleading .
Among the 418 patients who were treated with Unituxin in combination with GM - CSF , IL - 2 , and RA in Study 2 , Study 3 and Study DIV - NB - 201 , 86 patients ( 20 . 6 % ) tested positive for anti - dinutuximab antibodies ( ADA ) .
Of the 86 ADA positive patients , 45 ( 52 . 3 % ) tested positive for neutralizing antibodies .
Among the 27 patients who were treated with Unituxin in combination with lenalidomide and isotretinoin in Study NANT 2011 - 04 , 13 patients ( 48 . 1 % ) tested positive for ADA .
Of the 13 ADA positive patients , 2 ( 15 . 4 % ) also tested positive for neutralizing antibodies .
The clearance of dinutuximab was 60 % higher for the ADA positive patients than the ADA negative patients .
The presence of ADA did not have a clinically significant effect on the incidence or severity of adverse reactions .
There were insufficient number of patients with ADA to determine whether ADA alters the efficacy of Unituxin .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of Unituxin .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Neurotoxicity : prolonged urinary retention , transverse myelitis , and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome ( RPLS ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS No drug - drug interaction studies have been conducted with dinutuximab .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action , Unituxin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no studies in pregnant women and no reproductive studies in animals to inform the drug - associated risk .
Monoclonal antibodies are transported across the placenta in a linear fashion as pregnancy progresses , with the largest amount transferred during the third trimester .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
However , the background risk in the U . S . general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 to 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of dinutuximab in human milk , the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant , or the effects of the drug on milk production .
However , human IgG is present in human milk .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant , advise a nursing woman to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with Unituxin .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception Females Unituxin may cause fetal harm [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 2 months after the last dose of Unituxin .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Unituxin as part of multi - agent , multimodality therapy have been established in pediatric patients with high - risk neuroblastoma based on results of an open - label , randomized ( 1 : 1 ) trial conducted in 226 patients aged 11 months to 15 years ( median age 3 . 8 years ) ( Study 1 ) .
Prior to enrollment , patients achieved at least a partial response to prior first - line therapy for high - risk neuroblastoma consisting of induction combination chemotherapy , maximum feasible surgical resection , myeloablative consolidation chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant , and received radiation therapy to residual soft tissue disease .
Patients randomized to the Unituxin / 13 - cis - retinoic acid ( RA ) arm ( Unituxin / RA ) received up to 5 cycles of Unituxin in combination with alternating cycles of granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) and interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) plus RA , followed by 1 cycle of RA alone .
Patients randomized to the RA arm received up to 6 cycles of RA monotherapy .
Study 1 demonstrated an improvement in event - free survival ( EFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) in patients in the Unituxin / RA arm compared to those in the RA arm [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Juvenile monkeys ( 13 to 18 months of age at study start ) received dinutuximab daily via intravenous infusion for 4 consecutive days over five 28 - day cycles at doses of 1 , 3 , or 10 mg / kg .
Monkeys also received morphine during infusion for pain management .
At the high dose of 10 mg / kg ( approximately equal to the 17 . 5 mg / m2 clinical dose ) , mild degeneration of nerve fibers in the brain ( medulla oblongata ) and moderate degeneration of nerve fibers in the spinal cord ( cervical , thoracic , and lumbar ) were present .
Mild neuronal and nerve fiber degeneration were also present in the dorsal root ganglia ( cervical , thoracic , and lumbar ) .
Nerve fiber degeneration in the spinal cord and neuronal degeneration in dorsal root ganglia persisted 6 months after the end of dosing , though at lower severity .
At the 10 mg / kg dose level , nerve conduction velocity ( NCV ) analysis showed motor and sensory NCV decreases of less than 10 % compared to vehicle controls , starting on Day 27 and continuing to Day 83 .
Sensory NCV decreases were still present at the end of the dosing period but were on a trend towards recovery 6 months after the end of dosing .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Unituxin in geriatric patients have not been established .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Unituxin has not been studied in patients with renal impairment .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment Unituxin has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment .
11 DESCRIPTION Dinutuximab is a glycolipid disialoganglioside ( GD2 ) - binding chimeric monoclonal antibody composed of murine variable heavy and light chain regions and the human constant region for the heavy chain IgG1 and light chain kappa .
Dinutuximab is produced in the murine myeloma cell line , SP2 / 0 and has an approximate molecular weight of 150 kDa .
Unituxin ( dinutuximab ) injection is a sterile , preservative - free , clear and colorless to slightly opalescent solution for intravenous infusion .
Unituxin is supplied in single - dose vials of 17 . 5 mg / 5 mL .
Each mL of solution contains 3 . 5 mg of dinutuximab , and histidine ( 3 . 10 mg ) , polysorbate 20 ( 0 . 55 mg ) , sodium chloride ( 8 . 77 mg ) , and Water for Injection , USP ; hydrochloric acid is added to adjust pH to 6 . 8 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Dinutuximab binds to the glycolipid GD2 .
This glycolipid is expressed on neuroblastoma cells and on normal cells of neuroectodermal origin , including the central nervous system and peripheral nerves .
Dinutuximab binds to cell surface GD2 and induces cell lysis of GD2 - expressing cells through antibody - dependent cell - mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) and complement - dependent cytotoxicity ( CDC ) .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of dinutuximab was evaluated by a population pharmacokinetic analysis in a clinical study of Unituxin in combination with GM - CSF , IL - 2 , and RA .
In this study , 27 children with high - risk neuroblastoma ( age : 3 . 9 ± 1 . 9 years ) received up to 5 cycles of Unituxin at 17 . 5 mg / m2 / day as an intravenous infusion over 10 to 20 hours for 4 consecutive days every 28 days .
The observed maximum plasma dinutuximab concentration ( Cmax ) was 11 . 5 mcg / mL ( 20 % , coefficient of variation [ CV ] ) .
The mean volume of distribution at steady state ( Vdss ) was 5 . 4 L ( 28 % ) .
The clearance was 0 . 21 L / day ( 62 % ) and increased with body size .
The terminal half - life was 10 days ( 56 % ) .
No formal pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of dinutuximab .
Dedicated studies examining the effects of dinutuximab on fertility in animals have not been conducted .
No clear effects on reproductive organs were observed in general toxicology studies conducted in rats .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Nonclinical studies suggest that dinutuximab - induced neuropathic pain and neurotoxicity are mediated by binding of the antibody to the GD2 antigen located on the surface of nerve fibers and myelin and subsequent induction of CDC and ADCC activity .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and effectiveness of Unituxin was evaluated in a randomized , open - label , multicenter trial conducted in pediatric patients with high - risk neuroblastoma ( Study 1 ) .
All patients had received prior therapy consisting of induction combination chemotherapy , maximum feasible surgical resection , myeloablative consolidation chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant , and radiation therapy to residual soft tissue disease .
Patients were randomized between Day 50 and Day 77 post - autologous stem cell transplantation .
Patients were required to have achieved at least a partial response prior to autologous stem cell transplantation , have no evidence of disease progression following completion of front - line multi - modality therapy , have adequate pulmonary function ( no dyspnea at rest and peripheral arterial oxygen saturation of at least 94 % on room air ) , adequate hepatic function ( total bilirubin < 1 . 5 × the upper limit of normal and ALT < 5 × the upper limit of normal ) , adequate cardiac function ( shortening fraction of > 30 % by echocardiogram , or if shortening fraction abnormal , ejection fraction of 55 % by gated radionuclide study ) , and adequate renal function ( glomerular filtration rate at least 70 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) .
Patients with systemic infections or a requirement for concomitant systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressant usage were not eligible for enrollment .
Patients randomized to the Unituxin / RA arm received up to 5 cycles of Unituxin ( clinical trials material ) in combination with granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) ( Table 8 ) or interleukin - 2 ( IL - 2 ) ( Table 9 ) plus 13 - cis - retinoic acid ( RA ) , followed by 1 cycle of RA alone .
Patients randomized to the RA arm received 6 cycles of RA .
Unituxin was administered at a dose of 17 . 5 mg / m2 / day ( equivalent to 25 mg / m2 / day of clinical trials material ) on 4 consecutive days .
Patients in both treatment arms received 6 cycles of RA at a dose of 160 mg / m2 / day orally ( for patients weighing more than 12 kg ) or 5 . 33 mg / kg / day ( for patients weighing less than or equal to 12 kg ) in 2 divided doses for 14 consecutive days .

A total of 226 patients were randomized , 113 patients to each arm .
In general , demographic and baseline tumor characteristics were similar across study arms .
Across the study population , 60 % were male , the median age was 3 . 8 years and 3 % of patients were less than 1 . 5 years , 82 % were White and 7 % were Black .
The majority ( 80 % ) of patients had International Neuroblastoma Staging System Stage 4 disease .
Thirty - five percent of patients had a complete response , 43 % had a very good partial response , and 23 % had a partial response to therapy received prior to autologous stem cell transplant .
Forty - six percent of patients had neuroblastoma that was not MYCN - amplified , 36 % had tumors with known MYCN - amplification , and MYCN status was unknown or missing in 19 % of patients .
Forty - three percent of patients had hyperdiploid tumors , 36 % had diploid tumors , and DNA ploidy status was unknown or missing in 21 % of patients .
The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator - assessed event - free survival ( EFS ) , defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of relapse , progressive disease , secondary malignancy , or death .
Overall survival ( OS ) was also evaluated .
After observing a numerical improvement in EFS based on the seventh interim analysis , the Data Monitoring Committee recommended termination of accrual .
Efficacy results are shown in Table 10 .
