What is a vaginal yeast infection ?
A vaginal yeast infection is a common condition caused by an overgrowth of yeast ( Candida ) that may normally live in the vagina .
Your doctor may call this infection " monilia " or " candidiasis . "
Some women may have a yeast infection on the skin outside of the vagina ( vulva ) at the same time that they have a vaginal infection .
Who can get a vaginal yeast infection ?
You can get a vaginal yeast infection at any age .
It is most common during the childbearing years .
Women who are pregnant or diabetic , taking antibiotics , birth control pills or steroids , or who have a weakened immune system are more likely to get repeated yeast infections that may not clear up easily with proper treatment .
Some medical conditions can weaken the body ' s normal ability to fight infection .
One of the most serious of these conditions is infection with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV - the virus that causes AIDS ) .
The HIV virus causes the body to be more likely to get infections , including vaginal yeast infections that may not clear up easily with proper treatment .
If you may have been exposed to HIV and get repeated vaginal yeast infections , you should see your doctor right away .
For more information on HIV infection , please contact your doctor or the CDC National AIDS HOTLINE .
The CDC phone numbers are : 1 - 800 - 232 - 4636 ( English / Spanish ) , or 1 - 888 - 232 - 6348 ( hearing impaired , TTY ) .
How can I tell if I have a vaginal yeast infection ?
When you have a vaginal yeast infection , you may have one or more of the following symptoms : • • vaginal itching • • vaginal discharge that may be thick , white , and lumpy like cottage cheese • • vaginal soreness , irritation , or burning • • rash or redness on the skin outside the vagina ( vulva ) • • burning on urination • • painful vaginal intercourse ( sex ) Note : Vaginal yeast infections do NOT cause fever , chills , lower abdominal , back or shoulder pain , foul - smelling vaginal discharge , or a missed period .
These may be signs of a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) or a tubal pregnancy .
If you have these symptoms , call your doctor right away .
What are other causes of a vaginal discharge ?
It is normal to have a small amount of vaginal discharge at certain times of the month .
This normal discharge may be clear or slightly white and does not cause itching , pain or a foul odor .
The most common cause of an abnormal vaginal discharge is an infection .
These infections include bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) , trichomoniasis ( Trich ) , gonorrhea ( GC ) and / or chlamydia .
All of these may be transmitted sexually and are called sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) .
If you have more questions about sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) call the CDC Hotline at 1 - 800 - 232 - 4636 .
Although many of the infections mentioned above can cause symptoms similar to a vaginal yeast infection ( vaginal discharge , irritation and itching ) , their diagnosis must be made by a doctor so that proper treatment can be given .
If these infections are not properly treated or if proper treatment is delayed , serious problems , such as pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID ) may result , which may prevent you from having children in the future .
If you are pregnant and do not get the proper treatment , the infection may be passed to your baby before or during delivery and may cause your baby to have permanent damage .
If you have multiple sex partners or a new sex partner , you should also ask a doctor before use to make sure you do not have an STD .
Why do women get repeated vaginal yeast infections ?
Women may get repeated vaginal yeast infections that may not clear up easily with proper treatment .
Listed below are some of the causes of repeated yeast infections : • • hormonal changes occurring a few days before the monthly period • • use of antibiotics • • use of some birth control pills • • pregnancy • • diabetes ( " sugar " or " high blood sugar " ) • • clothing - wearing tight layers or moist clothing in the genital area • • weakened immune system - some drugs ( such as chemotherapy or steroids ) and medical conditions can weaken the body ' s normal ability to fight infection .
One of the most serious of these conditions is infection with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV - the virus that causes AIDS ) .
Infection with HIV causes the person to be more likely to get infections , including vaginal yeast infections .
If you get vaginal yeast infections often ( such as once a month or 3 in 6 months ) , you should talk to a doctor .
Are vaginal yeast infections sexually transmitted ?
Vaginal yeast infections are usually not spread by having intercourse ( sex ) .
However , if your partner has a rash , itching or discomfort in his genital area , he should contact a doctor to find out the cause of his symptoms and tell the doctor that you are treating your vaginal yeast infection with this product .
