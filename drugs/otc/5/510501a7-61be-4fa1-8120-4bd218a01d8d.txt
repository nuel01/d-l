2 . 3 CYP2C19 Poor Metabolizers CYP2C19 poor metabolizer status is associated with diminished antiplatelet response to clopidogrel .
Although a higher dose regimen ( 600 mg loading dose followed by 150 mg once daily ) in poor metabolizers increases antiplatelet response [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 5 ) ] , an appropriate dose regimen for this patient population has not been established in clinical outcome trials .

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Reduced effectiveness in impaired CYP2C19 function : Avoid concomitant use with drugs that inhibit CYP2C19 ( e . g . , omeprazole ) .
( 5 . 1 ) • Bleeding : Plavix increases risk of bleeding .
Discontinue 5 days prior to elective surgery .
( 5 . 2 ) • Discontinuation of Plavix : Premature discontinuation increases risk of cardiovascular events .
( 5 . 3 ) • Recent transient ischemic attack or stroke : Combination use of Plavix and aspirin in these patients was not shown to be more effective than Plavix alone , but was shown to increase major bleeding .
( 5 . 4 ) • Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP ) : TTP has been reported with Plavix , including fatal cases .
( 5 . 5 ) 5 . 1 Diminished Antiplatelet Activity Due to Impaired CYP2C19 Function Clopidogrel is a prodrug .
Inhibition of platelet aggregation by clopidogrel is entirely due to an active metabolite .
The metabolism of clopidogrel to its active metabolite can be impaired by genetic variations in CYP2C19 [ see Boxed Warning ] and by concomitant medications that interfere with CYP2C19 .
Avoid concomitant use of Plavix and drugs that inhibit CYP2C19 activity .
Co - administration of Plavix with omeprazole , a proton pump inhibitor that is an inhibitor of CYP2C19 , reduces the pharmacological activity of Plavix if given concomitantly or if given 12 hours apart [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 2 General Risk of Bleeding Thienopyridines , including Plavix , increase the risk of bleeding .
If a patient is to undergo surgery and an antiplatelet effect is not desired , discontinue Plavix 5 days prior to surgery .
In patients who stopped therapy more than five days prior to CABG the rates of major bleeding were similar ( event rate 4 . 4 % Plavix + aspirin ; 5 . 3 % placebo + aspirin ) .
In patients who remained on therapy within five days of CABG , the major bleeding rate was 9 . 6 % for Plavix + aspirin , and 6 . 3 % for placebo + aspirin .
Thienopyridines inhibit platelet aggregation for the lifetime of the platelet ( 7 – 10 days ) , so withholding a dose will not be useful in managing a bleeding event or the risk of bleeding associated with an invasive procedure .
Because the half - life of clopidogrel ' s active metabolite is short , it may be possible to restore hemostasis by administering exogenous platelets ; however , platelet transfusions within 4 hours of the loading dose or 2 hours of the maintenance dose may be less effective .
5 . 3 Discontinuation of Plavix Avoid lapses in therapy , and if Plavix must be temporarily discontinued , restart as soon as possible .
Premature discontinuation of Plavix may increase the risk of cardiovascular events .
5 . 4 Patients with Recent Transient Ischemic Attack ( TIA ) or Stroke In patients with recent TIA or stroke who are at high risk for recurrent ischemic events , the combination of aspirin and Plavix has not been shown to be more effective than Plavix alone , but the combination has been shown to increase major bleeding .
5 . 5 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura ( TTP ) TTP , sometimes fatal , has been reported following use of Plavix , sometimes after a short exposure ( < 2 weeks ) .
TTP is a serious condition that requires urgent treatment including plasmapheresis ( plasma exchange ) .
It is characterized by thrombocytopenia , microangiopathic hemolytic anemia ( schistocytes [ fragmented RBCs ] seen on peripheral smear ) , neurological findings , renal dysfunction , and fever [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed below and elsewhere in the labeling : • Bleeding [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] • Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) ] Bleeding , including life - threatening and fatal bleeding , is the most commonly reported adverse reaction .

6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions and durations of follow up , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
Plavix has been evaluated for safety in more than 54 , 000 patients , including over 21 , 000 patients treated for 1 year or more .
The clinically important adverse reactions observed in trials comparing Plavix plus aspirin to placebo plus aspirin and trials comparing Plavix alone to aspirin alone are discussed below .
Bleeding CURE In CURE , Plavix use with aspirin was associated with an increase in major bleeding ( primarily gastrointestinal and at puncture sites ) compared to placebo with aspirin ( see Table 1 ) .
The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage ( 0 . 1 % ) and fatal bleeding ( 0 . 2 % ) were the same in both groups .
Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the clopidogrel group were epistaxis , hematuria , and bruise .
The overall incidence of bleeding is described in Table 1 .
Table 1 : CURE Incidence of Bleeding Complications ( % patients ) Event Plavix ( + aspirin ) [ 1 ] Placebo ( + aspirin ) null p - value ( n = 6259 ) ( n = 6303 ) Major bleeding [ 2 ] 3 . 7 [ 3 ] 2 . 7 [ 4 ] 0 . 001 Life - threatening bleeding 2 . 2 1 . 8 0 . 13 Fatal 0 . 2 0 . 2 5 g / dL hemoglobin drop 0 . 9 0 . 9 Requiring surgical intervention 0 . 7 0 . 7 Hemorrhagic strokes 0 . 1 0 . 1 Requiring inotropes 0 . 5 0 . 5 Requiring transfusion ( ≥ 4 units ) 1 . 2 1 . 0 Other major bleeding 1 . 6 1 . 0 0 . 005 Significantly disabling 0 . 4 0 . 3 Intraocular bleeding with significant loss of vision 0 . 05 0 . 03 Requiring 2 – 3 units of blood 1 . 3 0 . 9 Minor bleeding [ 5 ] 5 . 1 2 . 4 < 0 . 001 [ 1 ] Other standard therapies were used as appropriate .
[ 2 ] Life - threatening and other major bleeding .
[ 3 ] Major bleeding event rate for Plavix + aspirin was dose - dependent on aspirin : < 100 mg = 2 . 6 % ; 100 – 200 mg = 3 . 5 % ; > 200 mg = 4 . 9 % Major bleeding event rates for Plavix + aspirin by age were : < 65 years = 2 . 5 % , ≥ 65 to < 75 years = 4 . 1 % , ≥ 75 years = 5 . 9 % [ 4 ] Major bleeding event rate for placebo + aspirin was dose - dependent on aspirin : < 100 mg = 2 . 0 % ; 100 – 200 mg = 2 . 3 % ; > 200 mg = 4 . 0 % Major bleeding event rates for placebo + aspirin by age were : < 65 years = 2 . 1 % , ≥ 65 to < 75 years = 3 . 1 % , ≥ 75 years = 3 . 6 % [ 5 ] Led to interruption of study medication .
Ninety - two percent ( 92 % ) of the patients in the CURE study received heparin or low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) , and the rate of bleeding in these patients was similar to the overall results .
COMMIT In COMMIT , similar rates of major bleeding were observed in the Plavix and placebo groups , both of which also received aspirin ( see Table 2 ) .
Table 2 : Incidence of Bleeding Events in COMMIT ( % patients ) Type of bleeding Plavix ( + aspirin ) ( n = 22961 ) Placebo ( + aspirin ) ( n = 22891 ) p - value Major [ 1 ] noncerebral or cerebral bleeding [ 2 ] 0 . 6 0 . 5 0 . 59 Major noncerebral 0 . 4 0 . 3 0 . 48 Fatal 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 90 Hemorrhagic stroke 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 91 Fatal 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 81 Other noncerebral bleeding ( non - major ) 3 . 6 3 . 1 0 . 005 Any noncerebral bleeding 3 . 9 3 . 4 0 . 004 [ 1 ] Major bleeds were cerebral bleeds or non - cerebral bleeds thought to have caused death or that required transfusion .
[ 2 ] The relative rate of major noncerebral or cerebral bleeding was independent of age .
Event rates for Plavix + aspirin by age were : < 60 years = 0 . 3 % , ≥ 60 to < 70 years = 0 . 7 % , ≥ 70 years = 0 . 8 % .
Event rates for placebo + aspirin by age were : < 60 years = 0 . 4 % , ≥ 60 to < 70 years = 0 . 6 % , ≥ 70 years = 0 . 7 % .
CAPRIE ( Plavix vs . Aspirin ) In CAPRIE , gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred at a rate of 2 . 0 % in those taking Plavix vs . 2 . 7 % in those taking aspirin ; bleeding requiring hospitalization occurred in 0 . 7 % and 1 . 1 % , respectively .
The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 0 . 4 % for Plavix compared to 0 . 5 % for aspirin .
Other bleeding events that were reported more frequently in the Plavix group were epistaxis and hematoma .
Other Adverse Events In CURE and CHARISMA , which compared Plavix plus aspirin to aspirin alone , there was no difference in the rate of adverse events ( other than bleeding ) between Plavix and placebo .
In CAPRIE , which compared Plavix to aspirin , pruritus was more frequently reported in those taking Plavix .
No other difference in the rate of adverse events ( other than bleeding ) was reported .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of Plavix .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of an unknown size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Blood and lymphatic system disorders : Agranulocytosis , aplastic anemia / pancytopenia , thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( TTP ) • Gastrointestinal disorders : Gastrointestinal and retroperitoneal hemorrhage with fatal outcome , colitis ( including ulcerative or lymphocytic colitis ) , pancreatitis , stomatitis • General disorders and administration site condition : Fever , hemorrhage of operative wound • Hepato - biliary disorders : Acute liver failure , hepatitis ( non - infectious ) , abnormal liver function test • Immune system disorders : Hypersensitivity reactions , anaphylactoid reactions , serum sickness • Musculoskeletal , connective tissue and bone disorders : Musculoskeletal bleeding , myalgia , arthralgia , arthritis • Nervous system disorders : Taste disorders , fatal intracranial bleeding • Eye disorders : Eye ( conjunctival , ocular , retinal ) bleeding • Psychiatric disorders : Confusion , hallucinations • Respiratory , thoracic and mediastinal disorders : Bronchospasm , interstitial pneumonitis , respiratory tract bleeding • Renal and urinary disorders : Glomerulopathy , increased creatinine levels • Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Maculopapular or erythematous rash , urticaria , bullous dermatitis , eczema , toxic epidermal necrolysis , Stevens - Johnson syndrome , angioedema , erythema multiforme , skin bleeding , lichen planus • Vascular disorders : Vasculitis , hypotension 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • CYP2C19 inhibitors ( e . g . , omeprazole ) : Avoid concomitant use .
( 7 . 1 ) • Nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) : Combination use increases risk of gastrointestinal bleeding .
( 7 . 2 ) • Warfarin : Combination use increases risk of bleeding .
( 7 . 3 ) 7 . 1 CYP2C19 Inhibitors Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19 .
Concomitant use of drugs that inhibit the activity of this enzyme results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition .
Avoid concomitant use of drugs that inhibit CYP2C19 , e . g . , omeprazole [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 5 ) ] .
Omeprazole In a crossover clinical study , 72 healthy subjects were administered Plavix ( 300 mg loading dose followed by 75 mg per day ) alone and with omeprazole ( 80 mg at the same time as Plavix ) for 5 days .
The exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel was decreased by 46 % ( Day 1 ) and 42 % ( Day 5 ) when Plavix and omeprazole were administered together .
Mean inhibition of platelet aggregation was diminished by 47 % ( 24 hours ) and 30 % ( Day 5 ) when Plavix and omeprazole were administered together .
In another study , 72 healthy subjects were given the same doses of Plavix and omeprazole but the drugs were administered 12 hours apart ; the results were similar , indicating that administering Plavix and omeprazole at different times does not prevent their interaction [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
7 . 2 Nonsteroidal Anti - Inflammatory Drugs ( NSAIDs ) Coadministration of Plavix and NSAIDs increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding .
7 . 3 Warfarin ( CYP2C9 Substrates ) Although the administration of clopidogrel 75 mg per day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S - warfarin ( a CYP2C9 substrate ) or INR in patients receiving long - term warfarin therapy , coadministration of Plavix with warfarin increases the risk of bleeding because of independent effects on hemostasis .
However , at high concentrations in vitro , clopidogrel inhibits CYP2C9 .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers : Discontinue drug or nursing , taking into consideration importance of drug to mother .
( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 500 and 300 mg / kg / day , respectively ( 65 and 78 times the recommended daily human dose , respectively , on a mg / m2 basis ) , revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or fetotoxicity due to clopidogrel .
There are , however , no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of a human response , Plavix should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Studies in rats have shown that clopidogrel and / or its metabolites are excreted in the milk .
It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from clopidogrel , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects in the CAPRIE and CURE controlled clinical studies , approximately 50 % of patients treated with Plavix were 65 years of age and older , and 15 % were 75 years and older .
In COMMIT , approximately 58 % of the patients treated with Plavix were 60 years and older , 26 % of whom were 70 years and older .
The observed risk of thrombotic events with clopidogrel plus aspirin versus placebo plus aspirin by age category is provided in Figures 2 and 5 for the CURE and COMMIT trials , respectively [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 ) ] .
The observed risk of bleeding events with clopidogrel plus aspirin versus placebo plus aspirin by age category is provided in Tables 1 and 2 for the CURE and COMMIT trials , respectively [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Experience is limited in patients with severe and moderate renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Platelet inhibition by Plavix is irreversible and will last for the life of the platelet .
Overdose following clopidogrel administration may result in bleeding complications .
A single oral dose of clopidogrel at 1500 or 2000 mg / kg was lethal to mice and to rats and at 3000 mg / kg to baboons .
Symptoms of acute toxicity were vomiting , prostration , difficult breathing , and gastrointestinal hemorrhage in animals .
Based on biological plausibility , platelet transfusion may restore clotting ability .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Clopidogrel is an inhibitor of platelet activation and aggregation through the irreversible binding of its active metabolite to the P2Y12 class of ADP receptors on platelets .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Clopidogrel must be metabolized by CYP450 enzymes to produce the active metabolite that inhibits platelet aggregation .
The active metabolite of clopidogrel selectively inhibits the binding of adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) to its platelet P2Y12 receptor and the subsequent ADP - mediated activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb / IIIa complex , thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation .
This action is irreversible .
Consequently , platelets exposed to clopidogrel ' s active metabolite are affected for the remainder of their lifespan ( about 7 to 10 days ) .
Platelet aggregation induced by agonists other than ADP is also inhibited by blocking the amplification of platelet activation by released ADP .
Dose - dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation can be seen 2 hours after single oral doses of Plavix .
Repeated doses of 75 mg Plavix per day inhibit ADP - induced platelet aggregation on the first day , and inhibition reaches steady state between Day 3 and Day 7 .
At steady state , the average inhibition level observed with a dose of 75 mg Plavix per day was between 40 % and 60 % .
Platelet aggregation and bleeding time gradually return to baseline values after treatment is discontinued , generally in about 5 days .
Geriatric Patients Elderly ( ≥ 75 years ) and young healthy subjects had similar effects on platelet aggregation .
Renally - Impaired Patients After repeated doses of 75 mg Plavix per day , patients with severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance from 5 to 15 mL / min ) and moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance from 30 to 60 mL / min ) showed low ( 25 % ) inhibition of ADP - induced platelet aggregation .
Hepatically - Impaired Patients After repeated doses of 75 mg Plavix per day for 10 days in patients with severe hepatic impairment , inhibition of ADP - induced platelet aggregation was similar to that observed in healthy subjects .
Gender In a small study comparing men and women , less inhibition of ADP - induced platelet aggregation was observed in women .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Clopidogrel is a prodrug and is metabolized to a pharmacologically active metabolite and inactive metabolites .
Absorption After single and repeated oral doses of 75 mg per day , clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed .
Absorption is at least 50 % , based on urinary excretion of clopidogrel metabolites .
Effect of Food Plavix can be administered with or without food .
In a study in healthy male subjects when Plavix 75 mg per day was given with a standard breakfast , mean inhibition of ADP - induced platelet aggregation was reduced by less than 9 % .
The active metabolite AUC0 – 24 was unchanged in the presence of food , while there was a 57 % decrease in active metabolite Cmax .
Similar results were observed when a Plavix 300 mg loading dose was administered with a high - fat breakfast .
Metabolism Clopidogrel is extensively metabolized by two main metabolic pathways : one mediated by esterases and leading to hydrolysis into an inactive carboxylic acid derivative ( 85 % of circulating metabolites ) and one mediated by multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes .
Cytochromes first oxidize clopidogrel to a 2 - oxo - clopidogrel intermediate metabolite .
Subsequent metabolism of the 2 - oxo - clopidogrel intermediate metabolite results in formation of the active metabolite , a thiol derivative of clopidogrel .
This metabolic pathway is mediated by CYP2C19 , CYP3A , CYP2B6 and CYP1A2 .
The active thiol metabolite binds rapidly and irreversibly to platelet receptors , thus inhibiting platelet aggregation for the lifespan of the platelet .
The Cmax of the active metabolite is twice as high following a single 300 mg clopidogrel loading dose as it is after four days of 75 mg maintenance dose .
Cmax occurs approximately 30 to 60 minutes after dosing .
In the 75 to 300 mg dose range , the pharmacokinetics of the active metabolite deviates from dose proportionality : increasing the dose by a factor of four results in 2 . 0 - and 2 . 7 - fold increases in Cmax and AUC , respectively .
Elimination Following an oral dose of 14 C - labeled clopidogrel in humans , approximately 50 % of total radioactivity was excreted in urine and approximately 46 % in feces over the 5 days post - dosing .
After a single , oral dose of 75 mg , clopidogrel has a half - life of approximately 6 hours .
The half - life of the active metabolite is about 30 minutes .
12 . 5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C19 is involved in the formation of both the active metabolite and the 2 - oxo - clopidogrel intermediate metabolite .
Clopidogrel active metabolite pharmacokinetics and antiplatelet effects , as measured by ex vivo platelet aggregation assays , differ according to CYP2C19 genotype .
Genetic variants of other CYP450 enzymes may also affect the formation of clopidogrel ' s active metabolite .
The CYP2C19 * 1 allele corresponds to fully functional metabolism while the CYP2C19 * 2 and * 3 alleles are nonfunctional .
CYP2C19 * 2 and * 3 account for the majority of reduced function alleles in white ( 85 % ) and Asian ( 99 % ) poor metabolizers .
Other alleles associated with absent or reduced metabolism are less frequent , and include , but are not limited to , CYP2C19 * 4 , * 5 , * 6 , * 7 , and * 8 .
A patient with poor metabolizer status will possess two loss - of - function alleles as defined above .
Published frequencies for poor CYP2C19 metabolizer genotypes are approximately 2 % for whites , 4 % for blacks and 14 % for Chinese .
Tests are available to determine a patient ' s CYP2C19 genotype .
A crossover study in 40 healthy subjects , 10 each in the four CYP2C19 metabolizer groups , evaluated pharmacokinetic and antiplatelet responses using 300 mg followed by 75 mg per day and 600 mg followed by 150 mg per day , each for a total of 5 days .
Decreased active metabolite exposure and diminished inhibition of platelet aggregation were observed in the poor metabolizers as compared to the other groups .
When poor metabolizers received the 600 mg / 150 mg regimen , active metabolite exposure and antiplatelet response were greater than with the 300 mg / 75 mg regimen ( see Table 3 ) .
An appropriate dose regimen for this patient population has not been established in clinical outcome trials .

The relationship between CYP2C19 genotype and Plavix treatment outcome was evaluated in retrospective analyses of Plavix - treated subjects in CHARISMA ( n = 4862 ) and TRITON - TIMI 38 ( n = 1477 ) , and in several published cohort studies .
In TRITON - TIMI 38 and the majority of the cohort studies , the combined group of patients with either intermediate or poor metabolizer status had a higher rate of cardiovascular events ( death , myocardial infarction , and stroke ) or stent thrombosis compared to extensive metabolizers .
In CHARISMA and one cohort study , the increased event rate was observed only in poor metabolizers .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility There was no evidence of tumorigenicity when clopidogrel was administered for 78 weeks to mice and 104 weeks to rats at dosages up to 77 mg / kg per day , which afforded plasma exposures > 25 times that in humans at the recommended daily dose of 75 mg .
Clopidogrel was not genotoxic in four in vitro tests ( Ames test , DNA - repair test in rat hepatocytes , gene mutation assay in Chinese hamster fibroblasts , and metaphase chromosome analysis of human lymphocytes ) and in one in vivo test ( micronucleus test by oral route in mice ) .
Clopidogrel was found to have no effect on fertility of male and female rats at oral doses up to 400 mg / kg per day ( 52 times the recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The clinical evidence of the efficacy of Plavix is derived from three double - blind trials involving 77 , 599 patients .
The CAPRIE study ( Clopidogrel vs . Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events ) was a comparison of Plavix to aspirin .
The CURE ( Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Ischemic Events ) and the COMMIT / CCS - 2 ( Clopidogrel and Metoprolol in Myocardial Infarction Trial / Second Chinese Cardiac Study ) studies were comparisons of Plavix to placebo , given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy .
The CHARISMA ( Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk Ischemic Stabilization , Management , and Avoidance ) study ( n = 15 , 603 ) also compared Plavix to placebo , given in combination with aspirin and other standard therapy .
14 . 1 Acute Coronary Syndrome CURE The CURE study included 12 , 562 patients with ACS without ST - elevation ( UA or NSTEMI ) and presenting within 24 hours of onset of the most recent episode of chest pain or symptoms consistent with ischemia .
Patients were required to have either ECG changes compatible with new ischemia ( without ST - elevation ) or elevated cardiac enzymes or troponin I or T to at least twice the upper limit of normal .
The patient population was largely Caucasian ( 82 % ) and included 38 % women , and 52 % patients ≥ 65 years of age .
Patients were randomized to receive Plavix ( 300 - mg loading dose followed by 75 mg once daily ) or placebo , and were treated for up to one year .
Patients also received aspirin ( 75 – 325 mg once daily ) and other standard therapies such as heparin .
The use of GPIIb / IIIa inhibitors was not permitted for three days prior to randomization .
The number of patients experiencing the primary outcome ( CV death , MI , or stroke ) was 582 ( 9 . 3 % ) in the Plavix - treated group and 719 ( 11 . 4 % ) in the placebo - treated group , a 20 % relative risk reduction ( 95 % CI of 10 % – 28 % ; p < 0 . 001 ) for the Plavix - treated group ( see Table 4 ) .
Table 4 : Outcome Events in the CURE Primary AnalysisOutcome Plavix ( + aspirin ) [ 1 ] Placebo ( + aspirin ) null Relative Risk Reduction ( % ) ( 95 % CI ) ( n = 6259 ) ( n = 6303 ) Primary outcome ( Cardiovascular death , MI , stroke ) 582 ( 9 . 3 % ) 719 ( 11 . 4 % ) 20 % ( 10 . 3 , 27 . 9 ) p < 0 . 001 All Individual Outcome Events : [ 2 ] CV death 318 ( 5 . 1 % ) 345 ( 5 . 5 % ) 7 % ( - 7 . 7 , 20 . 6 ) MI 324 ( 5 . 2 % ) 419 ( 6 . 6 % ) 23 % ( 11 . 0 , 33 . 4 ) Stroke 75 ( 1 . 2 % ) 87 ( 1 . 4 % ) 14 % ( - 17 . 7 , 36 . 6 ) [ 1 ] Other standard therapies were used as appropriate .
[ 2 ] The individual components do not represent a breakdown of the primary and co - primary outcomes , but rather the total number of subjects experiencing an event during the course of the study .
Most of the benefit of Plavix occurred in the first two months , but the difference from placebo was maintained throughout the course of the trial ( up to 12 months ) ( see Figure 1 ) .
Figure 1 : Cardiovascular Death , Myocardial Infarction , and Stroke in the CURE Study [ MULTIMEDIA ] In CURE , the use of Plavix was associated with a lower incidence of CV death , MI or stroke in patient populations with different characteristics , as shown in Figure 2 .
The benefits associated with Plavix were independent of the use of other acute and long - term cardiovascular therapies , including heparin / LMWH , intravenous glycoprotein IIb / IIIa ( GPIIb / IIIa ) inhibitors , lipid - lowering drugs , beta - blockers , and ACE - inhibitors .
The efficacy of Plavix was observed independently of the dose of aspirin ( 75 – 325 mg once daily ) .
The use of oral anticoagulants , non - study anti - platelet drugs , and chronic NSAIDs was not allowed in CURE .
Figure 2 : Hazard Ratio for Patient Baseline Characteristics and On - Study Concomitant Medications / Interventions for the CURE Study [ MULTIMEDIA ] The use of Plavix in CURE was associated with a decrease in the use of thrombolytic therapy ( 71 patients [ 1 . 1 % ] in the Plavix group , 126 patients [ 2 . 0 % ] in the placebo group ; relative risk reduction of 43 % ) , and GPIIb / IIIa inhibitors ( 369 patients [ 5 . 9 % ] in the Plavix group , 454 patients [ 7 . 2 % ] in the placebo group , relative risk reduction of 18 % ) .
The use of Plavix in CURE did not affect the number of patients treated with CABG or PCI ( with or without stenting ) , ( 2253 patients [ 36 . 0 % ] in the Plavix group , 2324 patients [ 36 . 9 % ] in the placebo group ; relative risk reduction of 4 . 0 % ) .
COMMIT In patients with STEMI , the safety and efficacy of Plavix were evaluated in the randomized , placebo - controlled , double - blind study , COMMIT .
COMMIT included 45 , 852 patients presenting within 24 hours of the onset of the symptoms of myocardial infarction with supporting ECG abnormalities ( i . e . , ST - elevation , ST - depression or left bundle - branch block ) .
Patients were randomized to receive Plavix ( 75 mg once daily ) or placebo , in combination with aspirin ( 162 mg per day ) , for 28 days or until hospital discharge , whichever came first .
The primary endpoints were death from any cause and the first occurrence of re - infarction , stroke or death .
The patient population included 28 % women , 58 % age ≥ 60 years ( 26 % age ≥ 70 years ) , 55 % patients who received thrombolytics , 68 % who received ACE - inhibitors , and only 3 % who underwent PCI .
As shown in Table 5 and Figures 3 and 4 below , Plavix significantly reduced the relative risk of death from any cause by 7 % ( p = 0 . 029 ) , and the relative risk of the combination of re - infarction , stroke or death by 9 % ( p = 0 . 002 ) .

[ 2 ] Non - fatal MI and non - fatal stroke exclude patients who died ( of any cause ) .
Figure 3 : Cumulative Event Rates for Death in the COMMIT Study [ 1 ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ 1 ] All treated patients received aspirin .
Figure 4 : Cumulative Event Rates for the Combined End point Re - Infarction , Stroke or Death in the COMMIT Study [ 1 ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ 1 ] All treated patients received aspirin .
The effect of Plavix did not differ significantly in various pre - specified subgroups as shown in Figure 5 .
The effect was also similar in non - prespecified subgroups including those based on infarct location , Killip class or prior MI history ( see Figure 6 ) .
Such subgroup analyses should be interpreted cautiously .
Figure 5 : Effects of Adding Plavix to Aspirin on the Combined Primary Endpoint across Baseline and Concomitant Medication Subgroups for the COMMIT Study [ MULTIMEDIA ] * Three similar - sized prognostic index groups were based on absolute risk of primary composite outcome for each patient calculated from baseline prognostic variables ( excluding allocated treatments ) with a Cox regression model .

The patients randomized had : 1 ) recent histories of myocardial infarction ( within 35 days ) ; 2 ) recent histories of ischemic stroke ( within 6 months ) with at least a week of residual neurological signs ; or 3 ) established peripheral arterial disease .
Patients received randomized treatment for an average of 1 . 6 years ( maximum of 3 years ) .
The trial ' s primary outcome was the time to first occurrence of new ischemic stroke ( fatal or not ) , new myocardial infarction ( fatal or not ) , or other vascular death .
Deaths not easily attributable to nonvascular causes were all classified as vascular .
Table 6 : Outcome Events in the CAPRIE Primary Analysis Plavix aspirin Patients n = 9599 n = 9586 Ischemic stroke ( fatal or not ) 438 ( 4 . 6 % ) 461 ( 4 . 8 % ) MI ( fatal or not ) 275 ( 2 . 9 % ) 333 ( 3 . 5 % ) Other vascular death 226 ( 2 . 4 % ) 226 ( 2 . 4 % ) Total 939 ( 9 . 8 % ) 1020 ( 10 . 6 % ) As shown in the table , Plavix was associated with a lower incidence of outcome events , primarily MI .
The overall relative risk reduction ( 9 . 8 % vs . 10 . 6 % ) was 8 . 7 % , p = 0 . 045 .
Similar results were obtained when all - cause mortality and all - cause strokes were counted instead of vascular mortality and ischemic strokes ( risk reduction 6 . 9 % ) .
In patients who survived an on - study stroke or myocardial infarction , the incidence of subsequent events was lower in the Plavix group .
The curves showing the overall event rate are shown in Figure 7 .
The event curves separated early and continued to diverge over the 3 - year follow - up period .
Figure 7 : Fatal or Non - Fatal Vascular Events in the CAPRIE Study [ MULTIMEDIA ] The statistical significance favoring Plavix over aspirin was marginal ( p = 0 . 045 ) .
However , because aspirin is itself effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with recent myocardial infarction or stroke , the effect of Plavix is substantial .
The CAPRIE trial included a population that was randomized on the basis of 3 entry criteria .
The efficacy of Plavix relative to aspirin was heterogeneous across these randomized subgroups ( p = 0 . 043 ) .
It is not clear whether this difference is real or a chance occurrence .
Although the CAPRIE trial was not designed to evaluate the relative benefit of Plavix over aspirin in the individual patient subgroups , the benefit appeared to be strongest in patients who were enrolled because of peripheral vascular disease ( especially those who also had a history of myocardial infarction ) and weaker in stroke patients .
In patients who were enrolled in the trial on the sole basis of a recent myocardial infarction , Plavix was not numerically superior to aspirin .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 3 Lack of Established Benefit of Plavix plus Aspirin in Patients with Multiple Risk Factors or Established Vascular Disease CHARISMA The CHARISMA trial was a 15 , 603 subject , randomized , double - blind , parallel group study comparing Plavix ( 75 mg daily ) to placebo for prevention of ischemic events in patients with vascular disease or multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis .
All subjects were treated with aspirin 75 – 162 mg daily .
The mean duration of treatment was 23 months .
The study failed to demonstrate a reduction in the occurrence of the primary endpoint , a composite of CV death , MI , or stroke .
A total of 534 ( 6 . 9 % ) patients in the Plavix group versus 573 ( 7 . 4 % ) patients in the placebo group experienced a primary outcome event ( p = 0 . 22 ) .
Bleeding of all severities was more common in the subjects randomized to Plavix .
