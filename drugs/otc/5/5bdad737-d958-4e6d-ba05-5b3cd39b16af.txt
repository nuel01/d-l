The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay .
Additionally , the observed incidence of antibody ( including neutralizing antibody ) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology , sample handling , timing of sample collection , concomitant medications , and underlying disease .
For these reasons , comparison of incidence of antibodies to CYRAMZA with the incidences of antibodies to other products may be misleading .
In clinical trials , 86 / 2890 ( 3 % ) of CYRAMZA - treated patients tested positive for treatment - emergent anti - ramucirumab antibodies by an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) .
Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 14 of the 86 patients who tested positive for treatment - emergent anti - ramucirumab antibodies .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of CYRAMZA .
Because such reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Blood and lymphatic system : Thrombotic microangiopathy • Neoplasms benign , malignant and unspecified : Hemangioma • Respiratory , thoracic , and mediastinal : Dysphonia • Vascular : Arterial ( including aortic ) aneurysms , dissections , and rupture • Cardiac : Heart failure 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] , CYRAMZA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no available data on CYRAMZA use in pregnant women .
Animal models link angiogenesis , VEGF and VEGFR2 to critical aspects of female reproduction , embryo - fetal development , and postnatal development .
No animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of ramucirumab on reproduction and fetal development .
Advise a pregnant woman of the potential risk to a fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data No animal studies have been specifically conducted to evaluate the effect of ramucirumab on reproduction and fetal development .
In mice , loss of the VEGFR2 gene resulted in embryo - fetal death and these fetuses lacked organized blood vessels and blood islands in the yolk sac .
In other models , VEGFR2 signaling was associated with development and maintenance of endometrial and placental vascular function , successful blastocyst implantation , maternal and feto - placental vascular differentiation , and development during early pregnancy in rodents and non - human primates .
Disruption of VEGF signaling has also been associated with developmental anomalies including poor development of the cranial region , forelimbs , forebrain , heart , and blood vessels .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of ramucirumab in human milk or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production .
Human IgG is present in human milk , but published data suggest that breast milk antibodies do not enter the neonatal and infant circulation in substantial amounts .
Because of the potential risk for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children from ramucirumab , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with CYRAMZA and for 2 months after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating CYRAMZA [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception Based on its mechanism of action , CYRAMZA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with CYRAMZA and for 3 months after the last dose .
Infertility Females Advise females of reproductive potential that based on animal data CYRAMZA may impair fertility [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of CYRAMZA in pediatric patients have not been established .
The safety and effectiveness of CYRAMZA as a single agent were assessed but not established in a single - arm , multicenter , open - label study [ NCT02564198 ] that included 23 pediatric patients aged 1 year to 16 years with relapsed or refractory solid tumors .
The effect on open tibial growth plates in pediatric patients who received CYRAMZA has not been adequately studied ; however , one patient in this study had progressive widening of distal femoral growth plate .
No other new safety signals were observed in pediatric patients .
The pharmacokinetics ( PK ) for these pediatric patients was within the range of the values previously observed in adults given the same dose per body weight .
Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data In animal studies , effects on epiphyseal growth plates were identified .
In cynomolgus monkeys , anatomical pathology revealed adverse effects on the epiphyseal growth plate ( thickening and osteochondropathy ) at all doses tested ( 5 - 50 mg / kg ) .
Ramucirumab exposure at the lowest weekly dose tested in the cynomolgus monkey was 0 . 2 times the exposure in humans at the recommended dose of ramucirumab as a single agent .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 563 CYRAMZA - treated patients in REGARD and RAINBOW , 205 ( 36 % ) were 65 and over , while 41 ( 7 % ) were 75 and over .

Of the 627 patients who received CYRAMZA with docetaxel in REVEL , 237 ( 38 % ) were 65 and over , while 45 ( 7 % ) were 75 and over .
In an exploratory subgroup analysis of REVEL , the hazard ratio for overall survival in patients less than 65 years old was 0 . 74 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 62 , 0 . 87 ) and in patients 65 years and over was 1 . 10 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 89 , 1 . 36 ) .
Of the 529 patients who received CYRAMZA with FOLFIRI in RAISE , 209 ( 40 % ) were 65 and over , while 51 ( 10 % ) were 75 and over .
Overall , no differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects .
Of the 197 patients who received CYRAMZA in REACH - 2 , 95 ( 48 % ) were 65 years and over , while 37 ( 19 % ) were 75 years and over .
Overall , no differences in efficacy were observed between these subjects and younger subjects .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild ( total bilirubin within ULN and aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ] > ULN or total bilirubin > 1 to 1 . 5 times ULN and any AST ) or moderate ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 to 3 times ULN and any AST ) hepatic impairment .
Clinical deterioration was reported in patients with Child - Pugh B or C cirrhosis who received single agent CYRAMZA [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION Ramucirumab is a human VEGFR2 antagonist .
It is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody .
Ramucirumab has an approximate molecular weight of 147 kDa .
Ramucirumab is produced in genetically engineered mammalian NS0 cells .
CYRAMZA ( ramucirumab ) injection for intravenous use is a sterile , preservative - free , clear to slightly opalescent and colorless to slightly yellow solution .
CYRAMZA is supplied at a concentration of 10 mg / mL in either 100 mg ( 10 mL ) or 500 mg ( 50 mL ) single - dose vials .
CYRAMZA is formulated in glycine ( 9 . 98 mg / mL ) , histidine ( 0 . 65 mg / mL ) , histidine monohydrochloride ( 1 . 22 mg / mL ) , polysorbate 80 ( 0 . 1 mg / mL ) , sodium chloride ( 4 . 383 mg / mL ) , and Water for Injection , USP , pH 6 . 0 .
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Ramucirumab is a VEGFR2 antagonist that specifically binds VEGFR2 and blocks binding of VEGFR ligands , VEGF - A , VEGF - C , and VEGF - D .
As a result , ramucirumab inhibits ligand - stimulated activation of VEGFR2 , thereby inhibiting ligand - induced proliferation , and migration of human endothelial cells .
Ramucirumab inhibited angiogenesis in an in vivo animal model .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of ramucirumab were studied in patients with various cancers over a dose range of 6 - 12 mg / kg administered every two or three weeks .
The PK characteristics of ramucirumab are similar for patients across cancer types based on a population PK analysis .
Ramucirumab systemic exposure increased dose proportionally at doses of 8 mg / kg and above and steady state concentrations were achieved at approximately 12 weeks .
Distribution The mean ( % coefficient of variation [ CV % ] ) volume of distribution of ramucirumab at steady - state ( Vss ) was 5 . 4 L ( 15 % ) .
Elimination The mean ( CV % ) clearance of ramucirumab was 0 . 015 L / hour ( 30 % ) and the mean elimination half - life was 14 days ( 20 % ) .
Specific Populations Age ( 19 - 88 years ) , sex ( 68 % male ) , race ( 70 % White , 24 % Asian ) , renal impairment ( creatinine clearance [ CLcr ] calculated by Cockcroft - Gault , 15 - 89 mL / min , mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin within ULN and AST > ULN or total bilirubin > 1 to 1 . 5 times ULN and any AST ) , or moderate hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 to 3 times ULN ) had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of ramucirumab .
The effect of severe hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 3 times ULN and any AST ) on the PK of ramucirumab is unknown .
Drug Interaction Studies No clinically meaningful changes in the exposure of either ramucirumab or its concomitant drugs in the approved combinations , including paclitaxel , docetaxel , irinotecan ( or its active metabolite , SN - 38 ) , and erlotinib were observed in patients with solid tumors .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No animal studies have been performed to test ramucirumab for potential carcinogenicity or genotoxicity .
Inhibition of VEGFR2 signaling in animal models was shown to result in changes to hormone levels critical for pregnancy , and , in monkeys , an increased duration of the follicular cycle .
In a 39 week animal study , female monkeys treated with ramucirumab showed dose dependent increases in follicular mineralization of the ovary .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Adverse effects in the kidney ( glomerulonephritis ) occurred in monkeys at doses of 16 - 50 mg / kg ( 0 . 7 - 5 . 5 times the exposure in humans at the recommended dose of ramucirumab as a single agent ) .
A single dose of ramucirumab resulting in an exposure approximately 10 times the human exposure at the recommended dose of ramucirumab as a single agent did not significantly impair wound healing in monkeys using a full - thickness incisional model .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Gastric Cancer REGARD The efficacy of CYRAMZA was evaluated in REGARD ( NCT00917384 ) , a multinational , randomized , double - blind , multicenter study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer ( including adenocarcinoma of the GEJ ) who previously received platinum - or fluoropyrimidine - containing chemotherapy .
Patients were required to have experienced disease progression either within 4 months after the last dose of first - line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease or within 6 months after the last dose of adjuvant therapy .
Patients were also required to have ECOG PS of 0 or 1 .
Patients were randomized ( 2 : 1 ) to receive either an intravenous infusion of CYRAMZA 8 mg / kg or placebo every 2 weeks .
Randomization was stratified by weight loss over the prior 3 months ( ≥ 10 % versus < 10 % ) , geographic region , and location of the primary tumor ( gastric versus GEJ ) .
The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival ( OS ) .
An additional efficacy outcome measure was progression - free survival ( PFS ) .
A total of 355 patients were randomized , 238 to the CYRAMZA - treatment group and 117 to the placebo - treatment group .
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between treatment arms .
The median age was 60 years ( range 24 - 87 ) ; 70 % were men ; 77 % were White , 16 % Asian ; 28 % had ECOG PS 0 and 72 % had ECOG PS 1 ; 91 % had measurable disease ; 75 % had gastric cancer ; and 25 % had adenocarcinoma of the GEJ .
The majority of patients ( 85 % ) experienced disease progression during or following first - line therapy for metastatic disease .
Prior chemotherapy for gastric cancer consisted of platinum / fluoropyrimidine combination therapy ( 81 % ) , fluoropyrimidine - containing regimens without platinum ( 15 % ) , and platinum - containing regimens without fluoropyrimidine ( 4 % ) .
Patients received a median of 4 doses ( range 1 - 34 ) of CYRAMZA or a median of 3 doses ( range 1 - 30 ) of placebo .
Efficacy results are shown in Table 10 and Figure 1 .

Patients were required to have experienced disease progression during , or within 4 months after the last dose of first - line therapy .
Patients were also required to have ECOG PS of 0 or 1 .
Patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to receive either CYRAMZA 8 mg / kg or placebo as an intravenous infusion every 2 weeks ( on Days 1 and 15 ) of each 28 - day cycle .
Patients in both arms received paclitaxel 80 mg / m2 by intravenous infusion on Days 1 , 8 , and 15 of each 28 - day cycle .
Prior to administration of each dose of paclitaxel , patients were required to have adequate hematopoietic and hepatic function .
The paclitaxel dose was permanently reduced , in increments of 10 mg / m2 , for a maximum of two dose reductions for Grade 4 hematologic toxicity or Grade 3 paclitaxel - related non - hematologic toxicity .
