Dosage and Administration 2 . 1 General Dosing Recommendations Because the formulations have different pharmacokinetic profiles , do not substitute ISENTRESS chewable tablets or ISENTRESS for oral suspension for the ISENTRESS 400 mg film - coated tablet or the ISENTRESS HD 600 mg film - coated tablet .
See specific dosing guidance for chewable tablets and the formulation for oral suspension .
Because the extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown , dosing before a dialysis session should be avoided [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
ISENTRESS film - coated tablets must be swallowed whole .
ISENTRESS chewable tablets may be chewed or swallowed whole .
Maximum daily dose is 300 mg taken by mouth twice daily .
ISENTRESS for oral suspension : Pour packet contents of ISENTRESS for oral suspension into 5 mL of water and mix .
Each single - use packet for oral suspension contains 100 mg of raltegravir which is suspended in 5 mL of water giving a final concentration of 20 mg per mL .
Maximum daily dose is 100 mg taken by mouth twice daily .
Once mixed , measure the recommended volume ( dose ) of suspension with a syringe and administer the dose orally .
The dose of suspension should be administered orally within 30 minutes of mixing .

Contraindications none Warnings and Precautions 5 . 1 Severe Skin and Hypersensitivity Reactions Severe , potentially life - threatening , and fatal skin reactions have been reported .
These include cases of Stevens - Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis .
Hypersensitivity reactions have also been reported and were characterized by rash , constitutional findings , and sometimes , organ dysfunction , including hepatic failure .
Discontinue ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD and other suspect agents immediately if signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions develop ( including , but not limited to , severe rash or rash accompanied by fever , general malaise , fatigue , muscle or joint aches , blisters , oral lesions , conjunctivitis , facial edema , hepatitis , eosinophilia , angioedema ) .
Clinical status including liver aminotransferases should be monitored and appropriate therapy initiated .
Delay in stopping ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD treatment or other suspect agents after the onset of severe rash may result in a life - threatening reaction .
5 . 2 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy , including ISENTRESS .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , patients whose immune systems respond may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia , tuberculosis ) , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
Autoimmune disorders ( such as Graves ' disease , polymyositis , and Guillain - Barré syndrome ) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution ; however , the time to onset is more variable , and can occur many months after initiation of treatment .
5 . 3 Phenylketonurics ISENTRESS Chewable Tablets contain phenylalanine , a component of aspartame .
Each 25 mg ISENTRESS Chewable Tablet contains approximately 0 . 05 mg phenylalanine .
Each 100 mg ISENTRESS Chewable Tablet contains approximately 0 . 10 mg phenylalanine .
Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria .
Adverse reactions Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Treatment - Naïve Adults The safety of ISENTRESS was evaluated in HIV - infected treatment - naïve subjects in 2 Phase III studies : STARTMRK evaluated ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily versus efavirenz , both in combination with emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) , and ONCEMRK evaluated ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg ( 2 × 600 mg ) once daily versus ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily , both in combination with emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate .
Safety data from these two studies are presented side - by - side in Tables 5 and 6 to simplify presentation ; direct comparisons across trials should not be made due to differing duration of follow - up and study design .
STARTMRK ( ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily ) In STARTMRK , subjects received ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily ( N = 281 ) or efavirenz ( EFV ) 600 mg at bedtime ( N = 282 ) both in combination with emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , ( N = 282 ) .
During double - blind treatment , the total follow - up for subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily + emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was 1104 patient - years and 1036 patient - years for subjects receiving efavirenz 600 mg at bedtime + emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate .
In STARTMRK , the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events through Week 240 was 5 % in subjects receiving ISENTRESS + emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and 10 % in subjects receiving efavirenz + emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate .
ONCEMRK ( ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg [ 2 × 600 mg ] once daily ) In ONCEMRK , subjects received ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily ( n = 531 ) or ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily ( n = 266 ) both in combination with emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate .
During double - blind treatment , the total follow - up for subjects with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily was 516 patient - years and for ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily was 258 patient - years .
In ONCEMRK , the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events through Week 48 was 1 % in subjects receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg ( 2 × 600 mg ) once daily and 2 % in subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily .
Clinical adverse reactions of moderate to severe intensity occurring in ≥ 2 % of treatment - naïve subjects treated with ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily or efavirenz in STARTMRK through Week 240 or ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily or ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in ONCEMRK through Week 48 are presented in Table 5 .
In STARTMRK , clinical adverse reactions of all intensities ( mild , moderate and severe ) occurring in ≥ 2 % of subjects on ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily through Week 240 also include diarrhea , flatulence , asthenia , decreased appetite , abnormal dreams , depression and nightmare .
In ONCEMRK , clinical adverse reactions of all intensities ( mild , moderate and severe ) occurring in ≥ 2 % of subjects on ISENTRESS HD or ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily through Week 48 also include abdominal pain , diarrhea , vomiting , and decreased appetite .

A total of 462 subjects received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in combination with optimized background therapy ( OBT ) compared to 237 subjects taking placebo in combination with OBT .
The median duration of therapy in these trials was 96 weeks for subjects receiving ISENTRESS and 38 weeks for subjects receiving placebo .
The total exposure to ISENTRESS was 708 patient - years versus 244 patient - years on placebo .
The rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were 4 % in subjects receiving ISENTRESS and 5 % in subjects receiving placebo .
Clinical ADRs were considered by investigators to be causally related to ISENTRESS + OBT or placebo + OBT .
Clinical ADRs of moderate to severe intensity occurring in ≥ 2 % of subjects treated with ISENTRESS and occurring at a higher rate compared to placebo are presented in Table 8 .

These events have been included because of their seriousness , increased frequency compared with efavirenz or placebo , or investigator ' s assessment of potential causal relationship .
Gastrointestinal Disorders : abdominal pain , gastritis , dyspepsia , vomiting General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : asthenia Hepatobiliary Disorders : hepatitis Immune System Disorders : hypersensitivity Infections and Infestations : genital herpes , herpes zoster Psychiatric Disorders : depression ( particularly in subjects with a pre - existing history of psychiatric illness ) , including suicidal ideation and behaviors Renal and Urinary Disorders : nephrolithiasis , renal failure Selected Adverse Events - Adults In studies of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily , cancers were reported in treatment - experienced subjects who initiated ISENTRESS or placebo , both with OBT , and in treatment - naïve subjects who initiated ISENTRESS or efavirenz , both with emtricitabine ( + ) tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ; several were recurrent .
The types and rates of specific cancers were those expected in a highly immunodeficient population ( many had CD4 + counts below 50 cells / mm3 and most had prior AIDS diagnoses ) .
The risk of developing cancer in these studies was similar in the group receiving ISENTRESS and the group receiving the comparator .
Grade 2 - 4 creatine kinase laboratory abnormalities were observed in subjects treated with ISENTRESS and ISENTRESS HD ( see TABLES 6 and 8 ) .
Myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with ISENTRESS .
Use with caution in patients at increased risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis , such as patients receiving concomitant medications known to cause these conditions and patients with a history of rhabdomyolysis , myopathy or increased serum creatine kinase .
Rash occurred more commonly in treatment - experienced subjects receiving regimens containing ISENTRESS + darunavir / ritonavir compared to subjects receiving ISENTRESS without darunavir / ritonavir or darunavir / ritonavir without ISENTRESS .
However , rash that was considered drug related occurred at similar rates for all three groups .
These rashes were mild to moderate in severity and did not limit therapy ; there were no discontinuations due to rash .
Patients with Co - existing Conditions - Adults Patients Co - infected with Hepatitis B and / or Hepatitis C Virus In Phase III studies of ISENTRESS , patients with chronic ( but not acute ) active hepatitis B and / or hepatitis C virus co - infection were permitted to enroll provided that baseline liver function tests did not exceed 5 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) .
In the treatment - experienced studies , BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 , 16 % of all patients ( 114 / 699 ) were co - infected ; in the treatment - naïve studies , STARTMRK and ONCEMRK , 6 % ( 34 / 563 ) and 3 % ( 23 / 797 ) , respectively , were co - infected .
In general the safety profile of ISENTRESS in subjects with hepatitis B and / or hepatitis C virus co - infection was similar to that in subjects without hepatitis B and / or hepatitis C virus co - infection , although the rates of AST and ALT abnormalities were higher in the subgroup with hepatitis B and / or hepatitis C virus co - infection for all treatment groups .
At 96 weeks , in treatment - experienced subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily , Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST , ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 29 % , 34 % and 13 % , respectively , of co - infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS as compared to 11 % , 10 % and 9 % of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS .
At 240 weeks , in treatment - naïve subjects receiving ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily , Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST , ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 22 % , 44 % and 17 % , respectively , of co - infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS as compared to 13 % , 13 % and 5 % of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS .
At 48 weeks , in treatment - naïve subjects receiving ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg ( 2 × 600 mg ) once daily , Grade 2 or higher laboratory abnormalities that represent a worsening Grade from baseline of AST , ALT or total bilirubin occurred in 13 % , 33 % and 13 % , respectively , of co - infected subjects treated with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily as compared to 4 % , 3 % and 2 % of all other subjects treated with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily .
Pediatrics 2 to 18 Years of Age ISENTRESS has been studied in 126 antiretroviral treatment - experienced HIV - 1 infected children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age , in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 [ see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8 . 4 ) and CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
Of the 126 patients , 96 received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS .
In these 96 children and adolescents , frequency , type and severity of drug related adverse reactions through Week 24 were comparable to those observed in adults .
One patient experienced drug related clinical adverse reactions of Grade 3 psychomotor hyperactivity , abnormal behavior and insomnia ; one patient experienced a Grade 2 serious drug related allergic rash .
One patient experienced drug related laboratory abnormalities , Grade 4 AST and Grade 3 ALT , which were considered serious .
4 Weeks to less than 2 Years of Age ISENTRESS has also been studied in 26 HIV - 1 infected infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age , in combination with other antiretroviral agents in IMPAACT P1066 [ see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS ( 8 . 4 ) and CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
In these 26 infants and toddlers , the frequency , type and severity of drug - related adverse reactions through Week 48 were comparable to those observed in adults .
One patient experienced a Grade 3 serious drug - related allergic rash that resulted in treatment discontinuation .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ISENTRESS .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders : thrombocytopenia Gastrointestinal Disorders : diarrhea Hepatobiliary Disorders : hepatic failure ( with and without associated hypersensitivity ) in patients with underlying liver disease and / or concomitant medications Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : rhabdomyolysis Nervous System Disorders : cerebellar ataxia Psychiatric Disorders : anxiety , paranoia CLOSE Drug Interactions 7 . 1 Effect of Other Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir Raltegravir is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) enzymes .
Based on in vivo and in vitro studies , raltegravir is eliminated mainly by metabolism via a UGT1A1 - mediated glucuronidation pathway .
Coadministration of ISENTRESS with drugs that inhibit UGT1A1 may increase plasma levels of raltegravir and coadministration of ISENTRESS with drugs that induce UGT1A1 , such as rifampin , may reduce plasma levels of raltegravir ( see TABLE 10 ) .
Selected drug interactions are presented in Table 10 [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

7 . 2 Drugs without Clinically Significant Interactions with ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD ISENTRESS In drug interaction studies performed using ISENTRESS film - coated tablets 400 mg twice daily dose , raltegravir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of the following : ethinyl estradiol / norgestimate , methadone , midazolam , lamivudine , tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , etravirine , darunavir / ritonavir , or boceprevir .
Moreover , atazanavir , atazanavir / ritonavir , boceprevir , calcium carbonate antacids , darunavir / ritonavir , efavirenz , etravirine , omeprazole , or tipranavir / ritonavir did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of 400 mg twice daily raltegravir .
No dose adjustment is required when ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily is coadministered with these drugs .
ISENTRESS HD In drug interaction studies , efavirenz did not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg ( 2 × 600 mg ) once daily .
No dose adjustment is recommended when ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg once daily is coadministered with atazanavir , atazanavir / ritonavir , hormonal contraceptives , methadone , lamivudine , tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , darunavir / ritonavir , boceprevir , efavirenz and omeprazole .
Use in Specific Populations 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry ( APR ) at 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
Risk Summary Available data from the APR show no difference in the rate of overall birth defects for raltegravir compared to the background rate for major birth defects of 2 . 7 % in the U . S . reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program ( MACDP ) [ see DATA ] .
The rate of miscarriage is not reported in the APR .
The estimated background rate of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies in the U . S . general population is 15 - 20 % .
The background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
Methodological limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group .
The MACDP population is not disease - specific , evaluates women and infants from a limited geographic area , and does not include outcomes for births that occurred at < 20 weeks gestation [ see DATA ] .
In animal reproduction studies in rats and rabbits , no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed with oral administration of raltegravir during organogenesis at doses that produced exposures up to approximately 4 times the maximal recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 1200 mg [ see DATA ] .
Data Human Data Based on prospective reports from the APR of over 400 exposures to raltegravir during pregnancy resulting in live births ( including over 200 exposures in the first trimester ) , there was no difference between the overall risk of birth defects for raltegravir compared with the background birth defect rate of 2 . 7 % in the U . S . reference population of the MACDP .
The prevalence of defects in live births was 2 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 1 % to 5 . 8 % ) following first trimester exposure to raltegravir - containing regimens and 3 . 4 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 5 % to 6 . 6 % ) following second and third trimester exposure to raltegravir - containing regimens .
Animal Data In a combined embryo / fetal and pre / postnatal development study , raltegravir was administered orally to rats at doses of 100 , 300 , 600 mg / kg / day on gestation day 6 to 20 or from gestation day 6 to lactation day 20 .
No effects on pre / postnatal development were observed up to the highest dose tested .
Embryo - fetal findings were limited to an increase in the incidence of supernumerary ribs in the 600 mg / kg / day group .
Systemic exposure ( AUC ) at 600 mg / kg / day was approximately 3 times higher than exposure at the MRHD of 1200 mg .
In pregnant rabbits , raltegravir was administered orally at doses of 100 , 500 , or 1000 mg / kg / day during the gestation days 7 to 20 .
No embryo / fetal effects were noted up to the highest dose of 1000 mg / kg / day .
Systemic exposures ( AUC ) at 1000 mg / kg / day was approximately 4 times higher than exposures at the MRHD of 1200 mg .
In both species , raltegravir has been shown to cross the placenta , with fetal plasma concentrations observed in rats approximately 1 . 5 to 2 . 5 times greater than in maternal plasma and fetal plasma concentrations in rabbits approximately 2 % that of maternal concentrations on gestation day 20 .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV - 1 infected mothers in the United States not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV - 1 infection .
There are no data on the presence of raltegravir in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
When administered to lactating rats , raltegravir was present in milk [ see DATA ] .
Because of the potential for : 1 ) HIV transmission ( in HIV - negative infants ) , 2 ) developing viral resistance ( in HIV - positive infants ) , and 3 ) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant , instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving ISENTRESS / ISENTRESS HD .
Data Raltegravir was excreted into the milk of lactating rats following oral administration ( 600 mg / kg / day ) from gestation day 6 to lactation day 14 , with milk concentrations approximately 3 times that of maternal plasma concentrations observed 2 hours postdose on lactation day 14 .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic profile , and efficacy of twice daily ISENTRESS were evaluated in HIV - 1 infected infants , children and adolescents 4 weeks to 18 years of age in an open - label , multicenter clinical trial , IMPAACT P1066 [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) and CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
The safety profile was comparable to that observed in adults [ see ADVERSE REACTIONS ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 3 ) for dosing recommendations for children 4 weeks of age and older .
The safety and dosing information for ISENTRESS have not been established in infants less than 4 weeks of age .
ISENTRESS HD once daily has not been studied in pediatric patients .
However population PK modeling and simulation support the use of 1200 mg ( 2 × 600 mg ) once daily in pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of ISENTRESS / ISENTRESS HD did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger subjects .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment of ISENTRESS is necessary for patients with mild to moderate ( Child - Pugh A and B ) hepatic impairment .
No hepatic impairment study has been conducted with ISENTRESS HD and therefore administration in subjects with hepatic impairment is not recommended .
The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Use in Patients with Renal Impairment No dosage adjustment of ISENTRESS or ISENTRESS HD is necessary in patients with any degree of renal impairment [ see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
The extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown .
Overdosage In the event of an overdose , it is reasonable to employ the standard supportive measures , e . g . , remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract , employ clinical monitoring ( including obtaining an electrocardiogram ) , and institute supportive therapy if required .
The extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Clinical Pharmacology 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Raltegravir is an HIV - 1 antiviral drug [ see MICROBIOLOGY ( 12 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In a monotherapy study raltegravir ( 400 mg twice daily ) demonstrated rapid antiviral activity with mean viral load reduction of 1 . 66 log10 copies / mL by Day 10 .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At a dose 1 . 33 times the maximum approved recommended dose ( and peak concentrations 1 . 25 - fold higher than the maximum approved dose ) , raltegravir does not prolong the QT interval or PR interval to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Adults Absorption Raltegravir , given 400 mg twice daily , is absorbed with a Tmax of approximately 3 hours postdose in the fasted state in healthy subjects .
Raltegravir 1200 mg once daily is rapidly absorbed with median Tmaxof ~ 1 . 5 to 2 hours in the fasted state .
Raltegravir increases dose proportionally ( AUC and Cmax ) or slightly less than dose proportionally ( C12hr ) over the dose range 100 mg to 1600 mg .
The absolute bioavailability of raltegravir has not been established .
The chewable tablet and oral suspension have higher oral bioavailability compared to the 400 mg film - coated tablet .
Relative to the raltegravir 400 mg formulation , the raltegravir 600 mg formulation has higher relative bioavailability .
Steady - state is generally reached in 2 days , with little to no accumulation with multiple dose administration for the 400 mg twice daily and 1200 once daily formulation .
Effect of Food on Oral Absorption The food effect of various formulations are presented in Table 11 .
Table 11 : Effect of Food on the Pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir Formulations PK parameter ratio ( fed / fasted ) Formulation Meal Type AUC Ratio ( 90 % CI ) Cmax Ratio ( 90 % CI ) Cmin Ratio ( 90 % CI ) Low - fat meal : 300 Kcal , 2 . 5 g fat Moderate - fat meal : 600 Kcal , 21 g fat High - fat meal : 825 Kcal , 52 g fat 400 mg twice daily Low Fat 0 . 54 ( 0 . 41 - 0 . 71 ) 0 . 48 ( 0 . 35 - 0 . 67 ) 0 . 86 ( 0 . 54 - 1 . 36 ) Moderate Fat 1 . 13 ( 0 . 85 - 1 . 49 ) 1 . 05 ( 0 . 75 - 1 . 46 ) 1 . 66 ( 1 . 04 - 2 . 64 ) High Fat 2 . 11 ( 1 . 60 - 2 . 80 ) 1 . 96 ( 1 . 41 - 2 . 73 ) 4 . 13 ( 2 . 60 - 6 . 57 ) 1200 mg once daily Low Fat 0 . 58 ( 0 . 46 - 0 . 74 ) 0 . 48 ( 0 . 37 - 0 . 62 ) 0 . 84 ( 0 . 63 - 1 . 10 ) High Fat 1 . 02 ( 0 . 86 - 1 . 21 ) 0 . 72 ( 0 . 58 - 0 . 90 ) 0 . 88 ( 0 . 66 - 1 . 18 ) Chewable tablet High Fat 0 . 94 ( 0 . 78 - 1 . 14 ) 0 . 38 ( 0 . 28 - 0 . 52 ) 2 . 88 ( 2 . 21 - 3 . 75 ) Oral suspension The effect of food on oral suspension was not studied .
Distribution Raltegravir is approximately 83 % bound to human plasma protein over the concentration range of 2 to 10 µM .
In one study of HIV - 1 infected subjects who received raltegravir 400 mg twice daily , raltegravir was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid .
In the study ( n = 18 ) , the median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 5 . 8 % ( range 1 to 53 . 5 % ) of the corresponding plasma concentration .
This median proportion was approximately 3 - fold lower than the free fraction of raltegravir in plasma .
The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown .
Metabolism and Excretion The apparent terminal half - life of raltegravir is approximately 9 hours , with a shorter α - phase half - life ( ~ 1 hour ) accounting for much of the AUC .
Following administration of an oral dose of radiolabeled raltegravir , approximately 51 and 32 % of the dose was excreted in feces and urine , respectively .
In feces , only raltegravir was present , most of which is likely derived from hydrolysis of raltegravir - glucuronide secreted in bile as observed in preclinical species .
Two components , namely raltegravir and raltegravir - glucuronide , were detected in urine and accounted for approximately 9 and 23 % of the dose , respectively .
The major circulating entity was raltegravir and represented approximately 70 % of the total radioactivity ; the remaining radioactivity in plasma was accounted for by raltegravir - glucuronide .
The major mechanism of clearance of raltegravir in humans is UGT1A1 - mediated glucuronidation .
Table 12 : Multiple - Dose Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Raltegravir Following the Administration of 400 mg Twice Daily and 1200 mg Once Daily in HIV - infected Subjects Parameter 400 mg BID Geometric Mean ( % CV ) N = 6 1200 mg QD Geometric Mean ( % CV ) N = 524 AUC ( µM ∙ hr ) AUC0 - 12 = 14 . 3 ( 88 . 6 ) AUC0 - 24 = 55 . 3 ( 41 . 5 ) Cmax ( µM ) 4 . 5 ( 128 ) 15 . 7 ( 45 . 8 ) Cmin ( nM ) C12 = 142 ( 63 . 8 ) C24 = 107 ( 97 . 5 ) Special Populations Pediatric ISENTRESS Two pediatric formulations were evaluated in healthy adult volunteers , where the chewable tablet and oral suspension were compared to the 400 mg tablet .
The chewable tablet and oral suspension demonstrated higher oral bioavailability , thus higher AUC , compared to the 400 mg tablet .
In the same study , the oral suspension resulted in higher oral bioavailability compared to the chewable tablet .
These observations resulted in proposed pediatric doses targeting 6 mg / kg / dose for the chewable tablets and oral suspension .
As displayed in Table 13 , the doses recommended for HIV - infected infants , children and adolescents 4 weeks to 18 years of age [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 3 ) ] resulted in a pharmacokinetic profile of raltegravir similar to that observed in adults receiving 400 mg twice daily .
Overall , dosing in pediatric patients achieved exposures ( Ctrough ) above 45 nM in the majority of subjects , but some differences in exposures between formulations were observed .
Pediatric patients above 25 kg administered the chewable tablets had lower trough concentrations ( 113 nM ) compared to pediatric patients above 25 kg administered the 400 mg tablet formulation ( 233 nM ) [ see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14 . 3 ) ] .
As a result , the 400 mg film - coated tablet is the recommended dose in patients weighing at least 25 kg ; however , the chewable tablet offers an alternative regimen in patients weighing at least 25 kg who are unable to swallow the film - coated tablet [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
In addition , pediatric patients weighing 11 to 25 kg who were administered the chewable tablets had the lowest trough concentrations ( 82 nM ) compared to all other pediatric subgroups .

ISENTRESS HD ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg ( 2 × 600 mg ) was not evaluated in a pediatric clinical study .
Exposures for pediatric subjects weighing at least 40 kg administered ISENTRESS HD are predicted to be comparable to adult exposures observed from Phase III ONCEMRK .
Age / Race / Gender There is no clinically meaningful effect of age ( 18 years and older ) , race , or gender on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir .
Hepatic Impairment Raltegravir is eliminated primarily by glucuronidation in the liver .
The pharmacokinetics of a single 400 - mg dose of raltegravir were not altered in patients with moderate ( Child - Pugh Score 7 to 9 ) hepatic impairment .
No hepatic impairment study has been conducted with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg ( 2 × 600 mg ) once daily . The effect of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir has not been studied .
Renal Impairment Renal clearance of unchanged drug is a minor pathway of elimination .
The pharmacokinetics of a single 400 - mg dose of raltegravir were not altered in patients with severe ( 24 - hour creatinine clearance of < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) renal impairment .
No renal impairment study was conducted with ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg ( 2 × 600 mg ) once daily .
The extent to which ISENTRESS may be dialyzable is unknown .
Drug Interactions In vitro , raltegravir does not inhibit ( IC50 > 100 µM ) CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 or CYP3A .
In vivo , raltegravir does not inhibit CYP3A4 .
Moreover , in vitro , raltegravir did not induce CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 .
Similarly , raltegravir is not an inhibitor ( IC50 > 50 µM ) of UGT1A1 or UGT2B7 , and raltegravir does not inhibit P - glycoprotein - mediated transport .
Raltegravir drug interaction study results are shown in Tables 14 and 15 .

12 . 4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Raltegravir inhibits the catalytic activity of HIV - 1 integrase , an HIV - 1 encoded enzyme that is required for viral replication .
Inhibition of integrase prevents the covalent insertion , or integration , of unintegrated linear HIV - 1 DNA into the host cell genome preventing the formation of the HIV - 1 provirus .
The provirus is required to direct the production of progeny virus , so inhibiting integration prevents propagation of the viral infection .
Raltegravir did not significantly inhibit human phosphoryltransferases including DNA polymerases α , β , and γ .
Antiviral Activity in Cell Culture Raltegravir at concentrations of 31 ± 20 nM resulted in 95 % inhibition ( EC95 ) of viral spread ( relative to an untreated virus - infected culture ) in human T - lymphoid cell cultures infected with the cell - line adapted HIV - 1 variant H9IIIB .
In addition , 5 clinical isolates of HIV - 1 subtype B had EC95 values ranging from 9 to 19 nM in cultures of mitogen - activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
In a single - cycle infection assay , raltegravir inhibited infection of 23 HIV - 1 isolates representing 5 non - B subtypes ( A , C , D , F , and G ) and 5 circulating recombinant forms ( AE , AG , BF , BG , and cpx ) with EC50values ranging from 5 to 12 nM .
Raltegravir also inhibited replication of an HIV - 2 isolate when tested in CEMx174 cells ( EC95 value = 6 nM ) .
No antagonism was observed when human T - lymphoid cells infected with the H9IIIB variant of HIV - 1 were incubated with raltegravir in combination with non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( delavirdine , efavirenz , or nevirapine ) ; nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( abacavir , didanosine , lamivudine , stavudine , tenofovir , or zidovudine ) ; protease inhibitors ( amprenavir , atazanavir , indinavir , lopinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , or saquinavir ) ; or the entry inhibitor enfuvirtide .
Resistance The mutations observed in the HIV - 1 integrase coding sequence that contributed to raltegravir resistance ( evolved either in cell culture or in subjects treated with raltegravir ) generally included an amino acid substitution at either Y143 ( changed to C , H , or R ) or Q148 ( changed to H , K , or R ) or N155 ( changed to H ) plus one or more additional substitutions ( i . e . , L74M , E92Q , Q95K / R , T97A , E138A / K , G140A / S , V151I , G163R , H183P , Y226C / D / F / H , S230R , and D232N ) .
E92Q and F121C are occasionally seen in the absence of substitutions at Y143 , Q148 , or N155 in raltegravir - treatment failure subjects .
Treatment - Naïve Adult Subjects : By Week 240 in the STARTMRK trial , the primary raltegravir resistance - associated substitutions were observed in 4 ( 2 with Y143H / R and 2 with Q148H / R ) of the 12 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment - failure isolates .
By Week 48 in the ONCEMRK trial , primary resistance substitutions were observed in on - treatment isolates obtained from 4 ( N155H / I203M , N155H / V151I / D232N , N155H , E92Q / L74M ) of the 14 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data .
These isolates exhibited 9 . 3 - to 19 - fold reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir .
Treatment - Experienced Adult Subjects : By Week 96 in the BENCHMRK trials , at least one of the primary raltegravir resistance - associated substitutions , Y143C / H / R , Q148H / K / R , and N155H , was observed in 76 of the 112 virologic failure subjects with evaluable genotypic data from paired baseline and raltegravir treatment - failure isolates .
The emergence of the primary raltegravir resistance - associated substitutions was observed cumulatively in 70 subjects by Week 48 and 78 subjects by Week 96 , 15 . 2 % and 17 % of the raltegravir recipients , respectively .
Some ( n = 58 ) of those HIV - 1 isolates harboring one or more of the primary raltegravir resistance - associated substitutions were evaluated for raltegravir susceptibility yielding a median decrease of 26 . 3 - fold ( mean 48 . 9 ± 44 . 8 - fold decrease , ranging from 0 . 8 - to 159 - fold ) compared to the wild - type reference .
Cross Resistance Cross resistance has been observed among HIV - 1 integrase strand transfer inhibitors ( INSTIs ) .
Amino acid substitutions in HIV - 1 integrase conferring resistance to raltegravir generally also confer resistance to elvitegravir .
Substitutions at amino acid Y143 confer greater reductions in susceptibility to raltegravir than to elvitegravir , and the E92Q substitution confers greater reductions in susceptibility to elvitegravir than to raltegravir .
Viruses harboring a substitution at amino acid Q148 , along with one or more other raltegravir resistance substitutions , may also have clinically significant resistance to dolutegravir .
12 . 5 Pharmacogenomics UGT1A1 Polymorphism There is no evidence that common UGT1A1 polymorphisms alter raltegravir pharmacokinetics to a clinically meaningful extent .
In a comparison of 30 adult subjects with * 28 / * 28 genotype ( associated with reduced activity of UGT1A1 ) to 27 adult subjects with wild - type genotype , the geometric mean ratio ( 90 % CI ) of AUC was 1 . 41 ( 0 . 96 , 2 . 09 ) .
Nonclinical toxicology 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies of raltegravir in mice did not show any carcinogenic potential .
At the highest dose levels , 400 mg / kg / day in females and 250 mg / kg / day in males , systemic exposure was 1 . 8 - fold ( females ) or 1 . 2 - fold ( males ) greater than the AUC ( 54 µM ∙ hr ) at the 400 - mg twice daily human dose .
Treatment - related squamous cell carcinoma of nose / nasopharynx was observed in female rats dosed with 600 mg / kg / day raltegravir for 104 weeks .
These tumors were possibly the result of local irritation and inflammation due to local deposition and / or aspiration of drug in the mucosa of the nose / nasopharynx during dosing .
No tumors of the nose / nasopharynx were observed in rats dosed with 150 mg / kg / day ( males ) and 50 mg / kg / day ( females ) and the systemic exposure in rats was 1 . 7 - fold ( males ) to 1 . 4 - fold ( females ) greater than the AUC ( 54 µM ∙ hr ) at the 400 - mg twice daily human dose .
No evidence of mutagenicity or genotoxicity was observed in in vitro microbial mutagenesis ( Ames ) tests , in vitro alkaline elution assays for DNA breakage , and in vitro and in vivo chromosomal aberration studies .
No effect on fertility was seen in male and female rats at doses up to 600 mg / kg / day which resulted in a 3 - fold exposure above the exposure at the recommended human dose .
Clinical Studies 14 . 1 Description of Clinical Studies The evidence of durable efficacy of ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily is based on the analyses of 240 - week data from a randomized , double - blind , active - controlled trial , STARTMRK evaluating ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in antiretroviral treatment - naïve HIV - 1 infected adult subjects , the analysis of 48 - week data from a randomized , double - blind , active - control trial , ONCEMRK evaluating ISENTRESS HD 1200 mg ( 2 × 600 mg ) once daily in treatment - naïve adult subjects , and 96 - week data from 2 randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled studies , BENCHMRK 1 and BENCHMRK 2 , evaluating ISENTRESS 400 mg twice daily in antiretroviral treatment - experienced HIV - 1 infected adult subjects .

The primary virology endpoint was the proportion of subjects with HIV - 1 RNA less than 50 copies / mL at Week 24 with a prespecified non - inferiority margin of - 12 % for each study ; and the frequency of adverse events up to 24 weeks .
Subjects with a prior history of virological failure were not excluded and the number of previous antiretroviral therapies was not limited .
These studies were terminated after the primary efficacy analysis at Week 24 because they each failed to demonstrate non - inferiority of switching to ISENTRESS versus continuing on lopinavir ( + ) ritonavir .
In the combined analysis of these studies at Week 24 , suppression of HIV - 1 RNA to less than 50 copies / mL was maintained in 82 . 3 % of the ISENTRESS group versus 90 . 3 % of the lopinavir ( + ) ritonavir group .
Clinical and laboratory adverse events occurred at similar frequencies in the treatment groups .
14 . 4 Pediatric Subjects 2 to 18 Years of Age IMPAACT P1066 is a Phase I / II open label multicenter trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile , safety , tolerability , and efficacy of raltegravir in HIV infected children .
This study enrolled 126 treatment experienced children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age .
Subjects were stratified by age , enrolling adolescents first and then successively younger children .
Subjects were enrolled into cohorts according to age and received the following formulations : Cohort I ( 12 to less than 18 years old ) , 400 mg film - coated tablet ; Cohort IIa ( 6 to less than 12 years old ) , 400 mg film - coated tablet ; Cohort IIb ( 6 to less than 12 years old ) , chewable tablet ; Cohort III ( 2 to less than 6 years ) , chewable tablet .
Raltegravir was administered with an optimized background regimen .
The initial dose finding stage included intensive pharmacokinetic evaluation .
Dose selection was based upon achieving similar raltegravir plasma exposure and trough concentration as seen in adults , and acceptable short term safety .
After dose selection , additional subjects were enrolled for evaluation of long term safety , tolerability and efficacy .
Of the 126 subjects , 96 received the recommended dose of ISENTRESS [ see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
These 96 subjects had a median age of 13 ( range 2 to 18 ) years , were 51 % Female , 34 % Caucasian , and 59 % Black .
At baseline , mean plasma HIV - 1 RNA was 4 . 3 log10 copies / mL , median CD4 cell count was 481 cells / mm3 ( range : 0 – 2361 ) and median CD4 % was 23 . 3 % ( range : 0 – 44 ) .
Overall , 8 % had baseline plasma HIV - 1 RNA > 100 , 000 copies / mL and 59 % had a CDC HIV clinical classification of category B or C . Most subjects had previously used at least one NNRTI ( 78 % ) or one PI ( 83 % ) .
Ninety - three ( 97 % ) subjects 2 to 18 years of age completed 24 weeks of treatment ( 3 discontinued due to non - compliance ) .
At Week 24 , 54 % achieved HIV RNA < 50 copies / mL ; 66 % achieved HIV RNA < 400 copies / mL .
The mean CD4 count ( percent ) increase from baseline to Week 24 was 119 cells / mm3 ( 3 . 8 % ) .
4 Weeks to Less Than 2 Years of Age IMPAACT P1066 also enrolled HIV - infected , infants and toddlers 4 weeks to less than 2 years of age ( Cohorts IV and V ) who had received prior antiretroviral therapy either as prophylaxis for prevention of mother - to - child transmission ( PMTCT ) and / or as combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV infection .
Raltegravir was administered as an oral suspension without regard to food in combination with an optimized background regimen .
The 26 subjects had a median age of 28 weeks ( range : 4 - 100 ) , were 35 % female , 85 % Black and 8 % Caucasian .
At baseline , mean plasma HIV - 1 RNA was 5 . 7 log10 copies / mL ( range : 3 . 1 – 7 ) , median CD4 cell count was 1400 cells / mm3 ( range : 131 – 3648 ) and median CD4 % was 18 . 6 % ( range : 3 . 3 – 39 . 3 ) .
Overall , 69 % had baseline plasma HIV - 1 RNA exceeding 100 , 000 copies / mL and 23 % had a CDC HIV clinical classification of category B or C . None of the 26 subjects were completely treatment naïve .
All infants under 6 months of age had received nevirapine or zidovudine for prevention of mother - to - infant transmission , and 43 % of subjects greater than 6 months of age had received two or more antiretrovirals .
Of the 26 treated subjects , 23 subjects were included in the Week 24 and 48 efficacy analyses , respectively .
All 26 treated subjects were included for safety analyses .
At Week 24 , 39 % achieved HIV RNA < 50 copies / mL and 61 % achieved HIV RNA < 400 copies / mL .
The mean CD4 count ( percent ) increase from baseline to Week 24 was 500 cells / mm3 ( 7 . 5 % ) .
At Week 48 , 44 % achieved HIV RNA < 50 copies / mL and 61 % achieved HIV RNA < 400 copies / mL .
The mean CD4 count ( percent ) increase from baseline to Week 48 was 492 cells / mm3 ( 7 . 8 % ) .
