FOR DRUG DILUENT USE ONLY Flexible Plastic Container Rx only DESCRIPTION Sterile Water for Injection , USP is a sterile , nonpyrogenic , solute - free preparation of distilled water for injection .
It is for use only as a sterile solvent or diluent vehicle for drugs or solutions suitable for parenteral administration .
The pH is 5 . 5 ( 5 . 0 to 7 . 0 ) .
Sterile Water for Injection contains no bacteriostat , antimicrobial agent or added buffer and is intended only for single - dose injection after admixture with an appropriate solute or solution .
When smaller amounts are required , the unused portion should be discarded .
Sterile Water for Injection is a pharmaceutic aid ( vehicle ) and parenteral fluid replenisher after addition of an appropriate solute .
Water for Injection , USP is chemically designated H2O .
The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated polyvinylchloride .
Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly .
Solutions inside the plastic container also can leach out certain chemical components of the plastic in very small amounts before the expiration period is attained .
However , the safety of the plastic has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological standards for plastic containers .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When administered intravenously as a vehicle for drugs , sterile water for injection provides a source of water for parenteral fluid replenishment after sufficient solute is introduced to achieve an osmolarity of 112 mOsmol or more per liter .
Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70 % of total body weight .
Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters ( 1 . 0 to 1 . 5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production ) .
Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms .
Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium ( Na + ) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Sterile Water for Injection , USP is indicated for use only as a solvent or diluent vehicle for parenterally administered drugs or solutions and as a source of water for parenteral fluid replenishment after suitable additives are introduced .
For intravenous administration , an osmolar concentration not less than two - fifths ( 0 . 4 ) of the normal osmolarity of the extracellular fluid ( 280 mOsmol / liter ) is essential to avoid intravascular hemolysis .
CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not administer without the addition of a solute .
WARNINGS FOR DRUG DILUENT USE ONLY .
Intravenous administration of Sterile Water for Injection , USP without additives may result in hemolysis .
The intravenous administration of sterile water for injection with additives can cause fluid and / or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations , overhydration , congested states or pulmonary edema .
The risk of dilutional states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of administered parenteral solutions .
The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of such solutions .
WARNING : This product contains aluminum that may be toxic .
Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired .
Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature , and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions , which contain aluminum .
Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function , including premature neonates , who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg / kg / day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity .
Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration .
PRECAUTIONS Do not use for intravenous injection unless the osmolar concentration of additives totals at least 112 mOsmol / liter ( two - fifths of the normal osmolarity of the extracellular fluid — 280 mOsmol / liter ) .
Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged .
Discard unused portion .
Pregnancy Category C : Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with sterile water for injection .
It is also not known whether sterile water containing additives can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Sterile water for injection with additives should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Pediatric Use : The safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population are based on the similarity of the clinical conditions of the pediatric and adult populations .
In neonates or very small infants the volume of fluid may affect fluid and electrolyte balance .
This product contains no more than 25 mcg / L of aluminum .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Reactions which may occur because of the technique of administration include febrile response , infection at the site of injection , venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection , extravasation and hypervolemia .
If an adverse reaction does occur , discontinue the infusion , evaluate the patient , institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of overhydration or solute overload , re - evaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective measures .
( See WARNINGS . )
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Following suitable admixture of prescribed additive , the dose is usually dependent upon the age , weight and clinical condition of the patient .
Drug Interactions Additives may be incompatible .
Consult with pharmacist , if available .
When introducing additives , use aseptic technique , mix thoroughly and do not store .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
( See PRECAUTIONS ) .
HOW SUPPLIED Sterile Water for Injection , USP is supplied in a single - dose 1000 mL flexible plastic container ( NDC 0409 - 7990 - 09 [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] and 0990 - 7990 - 09 null , null ) .
ICU Medical is transitioning NDC codes from the " 0409 " to a " 0990 " labeler code .
Both NDC codes are expected to be in the market for a period of time .
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE To Open Tear outer wrap at notch and remove solution container .
If supplemental medication is desired , follow directions below before preparing for administration .
Some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed .
This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety .
The opacity will diminish gradually .
To Add Medication • Prepare additive port .
• Using aseptic technique and an additive delivery needle of appropriate length , puncture resealable additive port at target area , inner diaphragm and inject .
Withdraw needle after injecting medication .
• The additive port may be protected by covering with an additive cap .
• Mix container contents thoroughly .
Preparation for Administration ( Use aseptic technique ) • Close flow control clamp of administration set .
• Remove cover from outlet port at bottom of container .
• Insert piercing pin of administration set into port with a twisting motion until the set is firmly seated .
NOTE : See full directions on administration set carton .
• Suspend container from hanger .
• Squeeze and release drip chamber to establish proper fluid level in chamber .
• Open flow control clamp and clear air from set .
Close clamp .
• Attach set to venipuncture device .
If device is not indwelling , prime and make venipuncture .
• Regulate rate of administration with flow control clamp .
