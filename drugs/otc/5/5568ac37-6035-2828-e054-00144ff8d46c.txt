Rx Only Description Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % contains fluticasone propionate [ ( 6α , 11β , 16α , 17α ) - 6 , 9 , - difluoro - 11 - hydroxy - 16 - methyl - 3 - oxo - 17 - ( 1 - oxopropoxy ) androsta - 1 , 4 - diene - 17 - carbothioic acid , S - fluoromethyl ester ] , a synthetic fluorinated corticosteroid , for topical dermatologic use .
The topical corticosteroids constitute a class of primarily synthetic steroids used as anti - inflammatory and antipruritic agents .
Chemically , fluticasone propionate is C25H31F3O5S .
It has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Fluticasone propionate has a molecular weight of 500 . 6 .
It is a white to off - white powder and is insoluble in water .
Each gram of Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % contains fluticasone propionate 0 . 5 mg in a base of ceteth - 20 , cetostearyl alcohol , citric acid , dibasic sodium phosphate , isopropyl myristate , mineral oil , propylene glycol , and purified water , with imidurea as a preservative .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Clinical Pharmacology Like other topical corticosteroids , fluticasone propionate has anti - inflammatory , antipruritic , and vasoconstrictive properties .
The mechanism of the anti - inflammatory activity of the topical steroids , in general , is unclear .
However , corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2inhibitory proteins , collectively called lipocortins .
It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor , arachidonic acid .
Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2 .
Fluticasone propionate is lipophilic and has a strong affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor .
It has weak affinity for the progesterone receptor , and virtually no affinity for the mineralocorticoid , estrogen , or androgen receptors .
The therapeutic potency of glucocorticoids is related to the half - life of the glucocorticoid - receptor complex .
The half - life of the fluticasone propionate - glucocorticoid receptor complex is approximately 10 hours .
Studies performed with fluticasone propionate cream , 0 . 05 % indicate that it is in the medium range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids .
Pharmacokinetics Absorption - The activity of Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % is due to the parent drug , fluticasone propionate .
The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors , including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier .
Occlusive dressing enhances penetration .
Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin .
Inflammation and / or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption .
In a human study of 12 healthy males receiving 12 . 5 g of 0 . 05 % fluticasone propionate cream twice daily for 3 weeks , plasma levels were generally below the level of quantification ( 0 . 05 ng / mL ) .
In another study of 6 healthy males administered 25 g of 0 . 05 % fluticasone propionate cream under occlusion for 5 days , plasma levels of fluticasone ranged from 0 . 07 to 0 . 39 ng / mL .
In an animal study using radiolabeled 0 . 05 % fluticasone propionate cream and ointment preparations , rats received a topical dose of 1 g / kg for a 24 - hour period .
Total recovery of radioactivity was approximately 80 % at the end of 7 days .
The majority of the dose ( 73 % ) was recovered from the surface of the application site .
Less than 1 % of the dose was recovered in the skin at the application site .
Approximately 5 % of the dose was absorbed systemically through the skin .
Absorption from the skin continued for the duration of the study ( 7 days ) , indicating a long retention time at the application site .
Distribution - Following intravenous administration of 1 mg fluticasone propionate in healthy volunteers , the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding .
The apparent volume of distribution averaged 4 . 2 L / kg ( range , 2 . 3 to 16 . 7 L / kg ) .
The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 91 % .
Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes .
Fluticasone propionate is not significantly bound to human transcortin .
Metabolism - No metabolites of fluticasone propionate were detected in an in vitro study of radiolabeled fluticasone propionate incubated in a human skin homogenate .
The total blood clearance of systemically absorbed fluticasone propionate averages 1 , 093 mL / min ( range , 618 to 1 , 702 mL / min ) after a 1 - mg intravenous dose , with renal clearance accounting for less than 0 . 02 % of the total .
Fluticasone propionate is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 3A4 - mediated hydrolysis of the 5 - fluoromethyl carbothioate grouping .
This transformation occurs in 1 metabolic step to produce the inactive 17 - β - carboxylic acid metabolite , the only known metabolite detected in man .
This metabolite has approximately 2 , 000 times less affinity than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies .
Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man .
Excretion - Following intravenous dose of 1 mg in healthy volunteers , fluticasone propionate showed polyexponential kinetics and had an average terminal half - life of 7 . 2 hours ( range , 3 . 2 to 11 . 2 hour INdications & Usage Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % is a medium potency corticosteroid indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid - responsive dermatoses .
Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % may be used with caution in pediatric patients 3 months of age or older .
The safety and efficacy of drug use for longer than 4 weeks in this population have not been established .
The safety and efficacy of Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % in pediatric patients below 3 months of age have not been established .
Contraindications Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % is contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the components in the preparation ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
Precautions Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % contains the excipient imidurea which releases formaldehyde as a breakdown product .
Formaldehyde may cause allergic sensitization or irritation upon contact with the skin .
Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % should not be used in individuals with hypersensitivity to formaldehyde as it may prevent healing or worsen dermatitis .
General - Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis suppression with the potential for glucocorticosteroid insufficiency after withdrawal from treatment .
Manifestations of Cushing ' s syndrome , hyperglycemia , and glucosuria can also be produced in some patients by systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids while on treatment .
Patients applying a potent topical steroid to a large surface area or to areas under occlusion should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression .
This may be done by using the ACTH stimulation , A . M . plasma cortisol , and urinary free cortisol tests .
If HPA axis suppression is noted , an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug , to reduce the frequency of application , or to substitute a less potent steroid .
Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids .
Infrequently , signs and symptoms of glucocorticosteroid insufficiency may occur requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids .
For information on systemic supplementation , see prescribing information for those products .
Fluticasone propionate cream , 0 . 05 % caused depression of A . M . plasma cortisol levels in 1 of 6 adult patients when used daily for 7 days in patients with psoriasis or eczema involving at least 30 % of the body surface .
After 2 days of treatment , this patient developed a 60 % decrease from pretreatment values in the A . M . plasma cortisol level .
There was some evidence of corresponding decrease in the 24 - hour urinary free cortisol levels .
The A . M . plasma cortisol level remained slightly depressed for 48 hours but recovered by day 6 of treatment .
Fluticasone propionate cream , 0 . 05 % , caused HPA axis suppression in 2 of 43 pediatric patients , ages 2 and 5 years old , who were treated for 4 weeks covering at least 35 % of the body surface area .
Follow - up testing 12 days after treatment discontinuation , available for 1 of the 2 subjects , demonstrated a normally responsive HPA axis ( see PRECAUTIONS - PEDIATRIC USE ) .
Pediatric patients may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses due to their larger skin surface to body mass ratios ( see PRECAUTIONS - PEDIATRIC USE ) .
The following local adverse reactions have been reported with topical corticosteroids , and they may occur more frequently with the use of occlusive dressings and higher potency corticosteroids .
These reactions are listed in an approximately decreasing order of occurrence : irritation , folliculitis , acneiform eruptions , hypopigmentation , perioral dermatitis , allergic contact dermatitis , secondary infections , skin atrophy , striae , hypertrichosis , and miliaria .
Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % may cause local cutaneous adverse reactions ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
If irritation develops , Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted .
Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids .
Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing .
If concomitant skin infections are present or develop , an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used .
If a favorable response does not occur promptly , use of Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled .
Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % should not be used in the presence of preexisting skin atrophy and should not be used where infection is present at the treatment site .
Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % should not be used in the treatment of rosacea and perioral dermatitis .

Laboratory Tests - The following tests may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression : ACTH stimulation test A . M . plasma cortisol test Urinary free cortisol test Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility - Two 18 - month studies were performed in mice to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of fluticasone propionate when given topically ( as an 0 . 05 % ointment ) and orally .
No evidence of carcinogenicity was found in either study .
Fluticasone propionate was not mutagenic in the standard Ames test , E . coli fluctuation test , S . cerevisiae gene conversion test , or Chinese Hamster ovarian cell assay .
It was not clastogenic in mouse micronucleus or cultured human lymphocyte tests .
In a fertility and general reproductive performance study in rats , fluticasone propionate administered subcutaneously to females at up to 50 mcg / kg per day and to males at up to 100 mcg / kg per day ( later reduced to 50 mcg / kg per day ) had no effect upon mating performance or fertility .
These doses are approximately 15 and 30 times , respectively , the human systemic exposure following use of the recommended human topical dose of fluticasone propionate cream , 0 . 05 % , assuming human percutaneous absorption of approximately 3 % and the use in a 70 - kg person of 15 g / day .
Pregnancy : Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category C - Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels .
Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals .
Teratology studies in the mouse demonstrated fluticasone propionate to be teratogenic ( cleft palate ) when administered subcutaneously in doses of 45 mcg / kg / day and 150 mcg / kg / day .
This dose is approximately 14 and 45 times , respectively , the human topical dose of fluticasone propionate cream , 0 . 05 % .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % , should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Nursing Mothers - Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth , interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production , or cause other untoward effects .
It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % is administered to a nursing woman .

Formaldehyde may cause allergic sensitization or irritation upon contact with the skin .
Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % should not be used in individuals with hypersensitivity to formaldehyde as it may prevent healing or worsen dermatitis .
Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % should be discontinued if control is achieved before 4 weeks .
If no improvement is seen within 2 weeks , contact a physician .
The safety and efficacy of drug use for longer than 4 weeks in this population have not been established .
The safety and efficacy of Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % in pediatric patients below 3 months of age have not been established .
Parents of pediatric patients should be advised not to use this medication in the treatment of diaper dermatitis unless directed by the physician .
Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % should not be applied in the diaper areas as diapers or plastic pants may constitute occlusive dressing .
Fluticasone propionate cream , 0 . 05 % caused HPA axis suppression in 2 of 43 pediatric patients , ages 2 and 5 years old , who were treated for 4 weeks covering at least 35 % of the body surface area .
Follow - up testing 12 days after treatment discontinuation , available for 1 of the 2 subjects , demonstrated a normally responsive HPA axis ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
Adverse effects including striae have been reported with use of topical corticosteroids in pediatric patients .
HPA axis suppression , Cushing ' s syndrome , linear growth retardation , delayed weight gain , and intracranial hypertension have been reported in pediatric patients receiving topical corticosteroids .
Manifestations of adrenal suppression in pediatric patients include low plasma cortisol levels to an absence of response to ACTH stimulation .
Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles , headaches , and bilateral papilledema .
Administration of topical corticosteroids to children should be limited to the least amount compatible with an effective therapeutic regimen .
Chronic corticosteroid therapy may interfere with the growth and development of children .
Geriatric Use - A limited number of patients above 65 years of age ( n = 126 ) have been treated with fluticasone propionate cream , 0 . 05 % in US and non - US clinical trials .
While the number of patients is too small to permit separate analysis of efficacy and safety , the adverse reactions reported in this population were similar to those reported by younger patients .
Based on available data , no adjustment of dosage of Fluticasone Propionate Cream , 0 . 05 % in geriatric patients is warranted .
Adverse Reactions Clinical Trial Experience - In controlled clinical trials of twice - daily administration , the total incidence of adverse reactions associated with the use of fluticasone propionate cream , 0 . 05 % was approximately 4 % .
These adverse reactions were usually mild ; self - limiting ; and consisted primarily of pruritus , dryness , numbness of fingers , and burning .
These events occurred in 2 . 9 % , 1 . 2 % , 1 . 0 % , and 0 . 6 % of patients , respectively .
Two clinical studies compared once - to twice - daily administration of fluticasone propionate cream , 0 . 05 % for the treatment of moderate to severe eczema .
The local drug - related adverse events for the 491 patients enrolled in both studies are shown in Table 1 .
In the study enrolling both adult and pediatric patients , the incidence of local adverse events in the 119 pediatric patients ages 1 to 12 years was comparable to the 140 patients ages 13 to 62 years .
Fifty - one pediatric patients ages 3 months to 5 years , with moderate to severe eczema , were enrolled in an open - label HPA axis safety study .
Fluticasone propionate cream , 0 . 05 % was applied twice daily for 3 to 4 weeks over an arithmetic mean body surface area of 64 % ( range , 35 % to 95 % ) .
The mean morning cortisol levels with standard deviations before treatment ( prestimulation mean value = 13 . 76 ± 6 . 94 mcg / dL , poststimulation mean value = 30 . 53 ± 7 . 23 mcg / dL ) and at end treatment ( prestimulation mean value = 12 . 32 ± 6 . 92 mcg / dL , poststimulation mean value = 28 . 84 ± 7 . 16 mcg / dL ) showed little change .
In 2 of 43 ( 4 . 7 % ) patients with end - treatment results , peak cortisol levels following cosyntropin stimulation testing were ≤ 18 μg / dL , indicating adrenal suppression .
Follow - up testing after treatment discontinuation , available for 1 of the 2 subjects , demonstrated a normally responsive HPA axis .
Local drug - related adverse events were transient burning , resolving the same day it was reported ; transient urticaria , resolving the same day it was reported ; erythematous rash ; dusky erythema , resolving within 1 month after cessation of fluticasone propionate cream , 0 . 05 % ; and telangiectasia , resolving within 3 months after stopping fluticasone propionate cream , 0 . 05 % .
