[ MULTIMEDIA ] Figure 1 .
Plasma Concentrations of Linezolid in Adults at Steady - State Following Oral Dosing Every 12 Hours ( Mean ± Standard Deviation , n = 16 ) Absorption Linezolid is rapidly and extensively absorbed after oral dosing .
Maximum plasma concentrations are reached approximately 1 to 2 hours after dosing , and the absolute bioavailability is approximately 100 % .
Therefore , linezolid may be given orally or intravenously without dose adjustment .
Linezolid may be administered without regard to the timing of meals .
The time to reach the maximum concentration is delayed from 1 . 5 hours to 2 . 2 hours and Cmax is decreased by about 17 % when high fat food is given with linezolid .
However , the total exposure measured as AUC0 - ∞ values is similar under both conditions .
Distribution Animal and human pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that linezolid readily distributes to well - perfused tissues .
The plasma protein binding of linezolid is approximately 31 % and is concentration - independent .
The volume of distribution of linezolid at steady - state averaged 40 to 50 liters in healthy adult volunteers .
Linezolid concentrations have been determined in various fluids from a limited number of subjects in Phase 1 volunteer studies following multiple dosing of linezolid .
The ratio of linezolid in saliva relative to plasma was 1 . 2 to 1 and for sweat relative to plasma was 0 . 55 to 1 .
Metabolism Linezolid is primarily metabolized by oxidation of the morpholine ring , which results in two inactive ring - opened carboxylic acid metabolites : the aminoethoxyacetic acid metabolite ( A ) , and the hydroxyethyl glycine metabolite ( B ) .
Formation of metabolite A is presumed to be formed via an enzymatic pathway whereas metabolite B is mediated by a non - enzymatic chemical oxidation mechanism in vitro .
In vitro studies have demonstrated that linezolid is minimally metabolized and may be mediated by human cytochrome P450 .
However , the metabolic pathway of linezolid is not fully understood .
Excretion Nonrenal clearance accounts for approximately 65 % of the total clearance of linezolid .
Under steady - state conditions , approximately 30 % of the dose appears in the urine as linezolid , 40 % as metabolite B , and 10 % as metabolite A .
The renal clearance of linezolid is low ( average 40 mL / min ) and suggests net tubular reabsorption .
Virtually no linezolid appears in the feces , while approximately 6 % of the dose appears in the feces as metabolite B , and 3 % as metabolite A .
A small degree of nonlinearity in clearance was observed with increasing doses of linezolid , which appears to be due to lower renal and nonrenal clearance of linezolid at higher concentrations .
However , the difference in clearance was small and was not reflected in the apparent elimination half - life .
Special Populations Geriatric The pharmacokinetics of linezolid are not significantly altered in elderly patients ( 65 years or older ) .
Therefore , dose adjustment for geriatric patients is not necessary .
Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of linezolid following a single IV dose were investigated in pediatric patients ranging in age from birth through 17 years ( including premature and full - term neonates ) , in healthy adolescent subjects ranging in age from 12 through 17 years , and in pediatric patients ranging in age from 1 week through 12 years .
The pharmacokinetic parameters of linezolid are summarized in Table 2 for the pediatric populations studied and healthy adult subjects after administration of single IV doses .
The Cmax and the volume of distribution ( Vss ) of linezolid are similar regardless of age in pediatric patients .
However , clearance of linezolid varies as a function of age .
With the exclusion of pre - term neonates less than one week of age , clearance is most rapid in the youngest age groups ranging from > 1 week old to 11 years , resulting in lower single - dose systemic exposure ( AUC ) and shorter half - life as compared with adults .
As age of pediatric patients increases , the clearance of linezolid gradually decreases , and by adolescence mean clearance values approach those observed for the adult population .
There is wider inter - subject variability in linezolid clearance and systemic drug exposure ( AUC ) across all pediatric age groups as compared with adults .
Similar mean daily AUC values were observed in pediatric patients from birth to 11 years of age dosed every 8 hours ( q8h ) relative to adolescents or adults dosed every 12 hours ( q12h ) .
Therefore , the dosage for pediatric patients up to 11 years of age should be 10 mg / kg q8h .
Pediatric patients 12 years and older should receive 600 mg q12h ( see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .

Plasma concentrations are higher in females than in males , which is partly due to body weight differences .
After a 600 - mg dose , mean oral clearance is approximately 38 % lower in females than in males .
However , there are no significant gender differences in mean apparent elimination - rate constant or half - life .
Thus , drug exposure in females is not expected to substantially increase beyond levels known to be well tolerated .
Therefore , dose adjustment by gender does not appear to be necessary .
Renal Insufficiency The pharmacokinetics of the parent drug , linezolid , are not altered in patients with any degree of renal insufficiency ; however , the two primary metabolites of linezolid may accumulate in patients with renal insufficiency , with the amount of accumulation increasing with the severity of renal dysfunction ( see Table 3 ) .
The clinical significance of accumulation of these two metabolites has not been determined in patients with severe renal insufficiency .
Because similar plasma concentrations of linezolid are achieved regardless of renal function , no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal insufficiency .
However , given the absence of information on the clinical significance of accumulation of the primary metabolites , use of linezolid in patients with renal insufficiency should be weighed against the potential risks of accumulation of these metabolites .
Both linezolid and the two metabolites are eliminated by dialysis .
No information is available on the effect of peritoneal dialysis on the pharmacokinetics of linezolid .
Approximately 30 % of a dose was eliminated in a 3 - hour dialysis session beginning 3 hours after the dose of linezolid was administered ; therefore , linezolid should be given after hemodialysis .

On the basis of the available information , no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild - to - moderate hepatic insufficiency .
The pharmacokinetics of linezolid in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency have not been evaluated .
Drug - Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Linezolid is not an inducer of cytochrome P450 ( CYP450 ) in rats .
In addition , linezolid does not inhibit the activities of clinically significant human CYP isoforms ( e . g . , 1A2 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 , 2E1 , 3A4 ) .
Therefore , linezolid is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of other drugs metabolized by these major enzymes .
Concurrent administration of linezolid does not substantially alter the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ( S ) - warfarin , which is extensively metabolized by CYP2C9 .
Drugs such as warfarin and phenytoin , which are CYP2C9 substrates , may be given with linezolid without changes in dosage regimen .
Antibiotics Aztreonam : The pharmacokinetics of linezolid or aztreonam are not altered when administered together .
Gentamicin : The pharmacokinetics of linezolid or gentamicin are not altered when administered together .
Rifampin : The effect of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of linezolid was evaluated in a study of 16 healthy adult males .
Volunteers were administered oral linezolid 600 mg twice daily for 5 doses with and without rifampin 600 mg once daily for 8 days .
Co - administration of rifampin with linezolid resulted in a 21 % decrease in linezolid Cmax [ 90 % CI , 15 % – 27 % ] and a 32 % decrease in linezolid AUC0 – 12 [ 90 % CI , 27 % – 37 % ] .
The mechanism of this interaction is not fully understood and may be related to the induction of hepatic enzymes ( see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ) .
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibition Linezolid is a reversible , nonselective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase .
Therefore , linezolid has the potential for interaction with adrenergic and serotonergic agents .
Adrenergic Agents : A significant pressor response has been observed in normal adult subjects receiving linezolid and tyramine doses of more than 100 mg .
Therefore , patients receiving linezolid need to avoid consuming large amounts of foods or beverages with high tyramine content ( see PRECAUTIONS , Information for Patients ) .
A reversible enhancement of the pressor response of either pseudoephedrine HCl ( PSE ) or phenylpropanolamine HCl ( PPA ) is observed when linezolid is administered to healthy normotensive subjects ( see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ) .
A similar study has not been conducted in hypertensive patients .
The interaction studies conducted in normotensive subjects evaluated the blood pressure and heart rate effects of placebo , PPA or PSE alone , linezolid alone , and the combination of steady - state linezolid ( 600 mg q12h for 3 days ) with two doses of PPA ( 25 mg ) or PSE ( 60 mg ) given 4 hours apart .
Heart rate was not affected by any of the treatments .
Blood pressure was increased with both combination treatments .
Maximum blood pressure levels were seen 2 to 3 hours after the second dose of PPA or PSE , and returned to baseline 2 to 3 hours after peak .
The results of the PPA study follow , showing the mean ( and range ) maximum systolic blood pressure in mm Hg : placebo = 121 ( 103 to 158 ) ; linezolid alone = 120 ( 107 to 135 ) ; PPA alone = 125 ( 106 to 139 ) ; PPA with linezolid = 147 ( 129 to 176 ) .
The results from the PSE study were similar to those in the PPA study .
The mean maximum increase in systolic blood pressure over baseline was 32 mm Hg ( range : 20 – 52 mm Hg ) and 38 mm Hg ( range : 18 – 79 mm Hg ) during co - administration of linezolid with pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine , respectively .
Serotonergic Agents : The potential drug - drug interaction with dextromethorphan was studied in healthy volunteers .
Subjects were administered dextromethorphan ( two 20 - mg doses given 4 hours apart ) with or without linezolid .
No serotonin syndrome effects ( confusion , delirium , restlessness , tremors , blushing , diaphoresis , hyperpyrexia ) have been observed in normal subjects receiving linezolid and dextromethorphan .
MICROBIOLOGY Linezolid is a synthetic antibacterial agent of a new class of antibiotics , the oxazolidinones , which has clinical utility in the treatment of infections caused by aerobic Gram - positive bacteria .
The in vitro spectrum of activity of linezolid also includes certain Gram - negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria .
Linezolid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis through a mechanism of action different from that of other antibacterial agents ; therefore , cross - resistance between linezolid and other classes of antibiotics is unlikely .
Linezolid binds to a site on the bacterial 23 S ribosomal RNA of the 50 S subunit and prevents the formation of a functional 70 S initiation complex , which is an essential component of the bacterial translation process .
The results of time - kill studies have shown linezolid to be bacteriostatic against enterococci and staphylococci .
For streptococci , linezolid was found to be bactericidal for the majority of strains .
In clinical trials , resistance to linezolid developed in 6 patients infected with Enterococcus faecium ( 4 patients received 200 mg q12h , lower than the recommended dose , and 2 patients received 600 mg q12h ) .
In a compassionate use program , resistance to linezolid developed in 8 patients with E . faecium and in 1 patient with Enterococcus faecalis .
All patients had either unremoved prosthetic devices or undrained abscesses .
Resistance to linezolid occurs in vitro at a frequency of 1 x 10 - 9 to 1 x 10 - 11 .
In vitro studies have shown that point mutations in the 23 S rRNA are associated with linezolid resistance .
Reports of vancomycin - resistant E . faecium becoming resistant to linezolid during its clinical use have been published . 1 In one report nosocomial spread of vancomycin - and linezolid - resistant E . faecium occurred 2 .
There has been a report of Staphylococcus aureus ( methicillin - resistant ) developing resistance to linezolid during its clinical use . 3 The linezolid resistance in these organisms was associated with a point mutation in the 23 S rRNA ( substitution of thymine for guanine at position 2576 ) of the organism .
When antibiotic - resistant organisms are encountered in the hospital , it is important to emphasize infection control policies . 4 , 5 Resistance to linezolid has not been reported in Streptococcus spp . , including Streptococcus pneumoniae .
In vitro studies have demonstrated additivity or indifference between linezolid and vancomycin , gentamicin , rifampin , imipenem - cilastatin , aztreonam , ampicillin , or streptomycin .
Linezolid has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms , both in vitro and in clinical infections , as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section .
Aerobic and facultative Gram - positive microorganisms Enterococcus faecium ( vancomycin - resistant strains only ) Staphylococcus aureus ( including methicillin - resistant strains ) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae ( including multi - drug resistant isolates [ MDRSP ] [ 1 ] ) Streptococcus pyogenes The following in vitro data are available , but their clinical significance is unknown .
At least 90 % of the following microorganisms exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for linezolid .
However , the safety and effectiveness of linezolid in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well - controlled clinical trials .
[ 1 ] MDRSP refers to isolates resistant to two or more of the following antibiotics : penicillin , second - generation cephalosporins , macrolides , tetracycline , and trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole .
Aerobic and facultative Gram - positive microorganisms Enterococcus faecalis ( including vancomycin - resistant strains ) Enterococcus faecium ( vancomycin - susceptible strains ) Staphylococcus epidermidis ( including methicillin - resistant strains ) Staphylococcus haemolyticus Viridans group streptococci Aerobic and facultative Gram - negative microorganisms Pasteurella multocida Susceptibility Testing Methods NOTE : Susceptibility testing by dilution methods requires the use of linezolid susceptibility powder .
When available , the results of in vitro susceptibility tests should be provided to the physician as periodic reports which describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community - acquired pathogens .
These reports should aid the physician in selecting the most effective antimicrobial .
Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations ( MICs ) .
These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds .
The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure .
Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method 6 , 7 ( broth or agar ) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of linezolid powder .
The MIC values should be interpreted according to criteria provided in Table 4 .
Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds .
One such standardized procedure 7 , 8 requires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations .
This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 µg of linezolid to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to linezolid .
The disk diffusion interpretive criteria are provided in Table 4 .
Table 4 .
Susceptibility Interpretive Criteria for LinezolidPathogen Susceptibility Interpretive Criteria Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations ( MIC in µg / mL ) Disk Diffusion ( Zone Diameters in mm ) S I R S I R Enterococcus spp ≤ 2 4 ≥ 8 ≥ 23 21 – 22 ≤ 20 Staphylococcus spp [ 1 ] ≤ 4 --- --- ≥ 21 --- --- Streptococcus pneumoniae null ≤ 2 [ 2 ] --- --- ≥ 21 [ 3 ] --- --- Streptococcus spp other than S pneumoniae null ≤ 2 null --- --- ≥ 21 null --- --- [ 1 ] The current absence of data on resistant strains precludes defining any categories other than " Susceptible . "
Strains yielding test results suggestive of a " nonsusceptible " category should be retested , and if the result is confirmed , the isolate should be submitted to a reference laboratory for further testing .
[ 2 ] These interpretive standards for S . pneumoniae and Streptococcus spp .
other than S . pneumoniae are applicable only to tests performed by broth microdilution using cation - adjusted Mueller - Hinton broth with 2 to 5 % lysed horse blood inoculated with a direct colony suspension and incubated in ambient air at 35 ° C for 20 to 24 hours .
[ 3 ] These zone diameter interpretive standards are applicable only to tests performed using Mueller - Hinton agar supplemented with 5 % defibrinated sheep blood inoculated with a direct colony suspension and incubated in 5 % CO2 at 35 ° C for 20 to 24 hours .
A report of " Susceptible " indicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable .
A report of " Intermediate " indicates that the result should be considered equivocal , and , if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative , clinically feasible drugs , the test should be repeated .
This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used .
This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation .
A report of " Resistant " indicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable ; other therapy should be selected .
Quality Control Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of quality control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the test procedures .
Standard linezolid powder should provide the following range of values noted in Table 5 .
NOTE : Quality control microorganisms are specific strains of organisms with intrinsic biological properties relating to resistance mechanisms and their genetic expression within bacteria ; the specific strains used for microbiological quality control are not clinically significant .

When culture and susceptibility information are available , they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy .
In the absence of such data , local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy .
[ 1 ] MDRSP refers to isolates resistant to two or more of the following antibiotics : penicillin , second - generation cephalosporins , macrolides , tetracycline , and trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole .
CONTRAINDICATIONS ZYVOX formulations are contraindicated for use in patients who have known hypersensitivity to linezolid or any of the other product components .
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Linezolid should not be used in patients taking any medicinal product which inhibits monoamine oxidases A or B ( e . g . , phenelzine , isocarboxazid ) or within two weeks of taking any such medicinal product .
Potential Interactions Producing Elevation of Blood Pressure Unless patients are monitored for potential increases in blood pressure , linezolid should not be administered to patients with uncontrolled hypertension , pheochromocytoma , thyrotoxicosis and / or patients taking any of the following types of medications : directly and indirectly acting sympathomimetic agents ( e . g . , pseudoephedrine ) , vasopressive agents ( e . g . , epinephrine , norepinephrine ) , dopaminergic agents ( e . g . , dopamine , dobutamine ) ( see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ) .
Potential Serotonergic Interactions Unless patients are carefully observed for signs and / or symptoms of serotonin syndrome , linezolid should not be administered to patients with carcinoid syndrome and / or patients taking any of the following medications : serotonin re - uptake inhibitors , tricyclic antidepressants , serotonin 5 - HT1 receptor agonists ( triptans ) , meperidine or buspirone ( see PRECAUTIONS , General and Drug Interactions ) .
WARNINGS Myelosuppression ( including anemia , leukopenia , pancytopenia , and thrombocytopenia ) has been reported in patients receiving linezolid .
In cases where the outcome is known , when linezolid was discontinued , the affected hematologic parameters have risen toward pretreatment levels .
Complete blood counts should be monitored weekly in patients who receive linezolid , particularly in those who receive linezolid for longer than two weeks , those with pre - existing myelosuppression , those receiving concomitant drugs that produce bone marrow suppression , or those with a chronic infection who have received previous or concomitant antibiotic therapy .
Discontinuation of therapy with linezolid should be considered in patients who develop or have worsening myelosuppression .
In adult and juvenile dogs and rats , myelosuppression , reduced extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen and liver , and lymphoid depletion of thymus , lymph nodes , and spleen were observed ( see ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY ) .
Mortality Imbalance in an Investigational Study in Patients with Catheter - Related Bloodstream Infections , including those with catheter - site infections An imbalance in mortality was seen in patients treated with linezolid relative to vancomycin / dicloxacillin / oxacillin in an open - label study in seriously ill patients with intravascular catheter - related infections [ 78 / 363 ( 21 . 5 % ) vs . 58 / 363 ( 16 . 0 % ) ; odds ratio 1 . 426 , 95 % CI 0 . 970 , 2 . 098 ] .
While causality has not been established , this observed imbalance occurred primarily in linezolid - treated patients in whom either Gram - negative pathogens , mixed Gram - negative and Gram - positive pathogens , or no pathogen were identified at baseline , but was not seen in patients with Gram - positive infections only .
Linezolid is not approved and should not be used for the treatment of patients with catheter - related bloodstream infections or catheter - site infections .
Linezolid has no clinical activity against Gram - negative pathogens and is not indicated for the treatment of Gram - negative infections .
It is critical that specific Gram - negative therapy be initiated immediately if a concomitant Gram - negative pathogen is documented or suspected ( see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) .
Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea ( CDAD ) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents , including ZYVOX , and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis .
Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C . difficile .
C . difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD .
Hypertoxin producing strains of C . difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality , as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy .
CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use .
Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents .
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed , ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C . difficile may need to be discontinued .
Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management , protein supplementation , antibiotic treatment of C . difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated .
PRECAUTIONS General Lactic Acidosis Lactic acidosis has been reported with the use of ZYVOX .
In reported cases , patients experienced repeated episodes of nausea and vomiting .
Patients who develop recurrent nausea or vomiting , unexplained acidosis , or a low bicarbonate level while receiving ZYVOX should receive immediate medical evaluation .
Serotonin Syndrome Spontaneous reports of serotonin syndrome associated with the co - administration of ZYVOX and serotonergic agents , including antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , have been reported ( see PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions ) .
Where administration of ZYVOX and concomitant serotonergic agents is clinically appropriate , patients should be closely observed for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome such as cognitive dysfunction , hyperpyrexia , hyperreflexia and incoordination .
If signs or symptoms occur physicians should consider discontinuation of either one or both agents .
If the concomitant serotonergic agent is withdrawn , discontinuation symptoms can be observed ( see package insert of the specified agent ( s ) for a description of the associated discontinuation symptoms ) .
Peripheral and Optic Neuropathy Peripheral and optic neuropathy have been reported in patients treated with ZYVOX , primarily those patients treated for longer than the maximum recommended duration of 28 days .
In cases of optic neuropathy that progressed to loss of vision , patients were treated for extended periods beyond the maximum recommended duration .
Visual blurring has been reported in some patients treated with ZYVOX for less than 28 days .
If patients experience symptoms of visual impairment , such as changes in visual acuity , changes in color vision , blurred vision , or visual field defect , prompt ophthalmic evaluation is recommended .
Visual function should be monitored in all patients taking ZYVOX for extended periods ( ≥ 3 months ) and in all patients reporting new visual symptoms regardless of length of therapy with ZYVOX .
If peripheral or optic neuropathy occurs , the continued use of ZYVOX in these patients should be weighed against the potential risks .
Convulsions Convulsions have been reported in patients when treated with linezolid .
In some of these cases , a history of seizures or risk factors for seizures was reported .
The use of antibiotics may promote the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms .
Should superinfection occur during therapy , appropriate measures should be taken .
ZYVOX has not been studied in patients with uncontrolled hypertension , pheochromocytoma , carcinoid syndrome , or untreated hyperthyroidism .
The safety and efficacy of ZYVOX formulations given for longer than 28 days have not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials .
Prescribing ZYVOX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug - resistant bacteria .
Information for Patients Patients should be advised that : • ZYVOX may be taken with or without food .
• They should inform their physician if they have a history of hypertension .
• Large quantities of foods or beverages with high tyramine content should be avoided while taking ZYVOX .
Quantities of tyramine consumed should be less than 100 mg per meal .
Foods high in tyramine content include those that may have undergone protein changes by aging , fermentation , pickling , or smoking to improve flavor , such as aged cheeses ( 0 to 15 mg tyramine per ounce ) ; fermented or air - dried meats ( 0 . 1 to 8 mg tyramine per ounce ) ; sauerkraut ( 8 mg tyramine per 8 ounces ) ; soy sauce ( 5 mg tyramine per 1 teaspoon ) ; tap beers ( 4 mg tyramine per 12 ounces ) ; red wines ( 0 to 6 mg tyramine per 8 ounces ) .
The tyramine content of any protein - rich food may be increased if stored for long periods or improperly refrigerated . 9 , 10 • They should inform their physician if taking medications containing pseudoephedrine HCl or phenylpropanolamine HCl , such as cold remedies and decongestants .
• They should inform their physician if taking serotonin re - uptake inhibitors or other antidepressants .
• Phenylketonurics : Each 5 mL of the 100 mg / 5 mL ZYVOX for Oral Suspension contains 20 mg phenylalanine .
The other ZYVOX formulations do not contain phenylalanine .
Contact your physician or pharmacist .
• They should inform their physician if they experience changes in vision .
• They should inform their physician if they have a history of seizures .
• Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics , which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued .
Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics , patients can develop watery and bloody stools ( with or without stomach cramps and fever ) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic .
If this occurs , patients should contact their physician as soon as possible .
Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including ZYVOX should only be used to treat bacterial infections .
They do not treat viral infections ( e . g . , the common cold ) .
When ZYVOX is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection , patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy , the medication should be taken exactly as directed .
Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may ( 1 ) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and ( 2 ) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ZYVOX or other antibacterial drugs in the future .
Drug Interactions ( see also CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Drug - Drug Interactions ) Monoamine Oxidase Inhibition Linezolid is a reversible , nonselective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase .
Therefore , linezolid has the potential for interaction with adrenergic and serotonergic agents .
Adrenergic Agents : Some individuals receiving ZYVOX may experience a reversible enhancement of the pressor response to indirect - acting sympathomimetic agents , vasopressor or dopaminergic agents .
Commonly used drugs such as phenylpropanolamine and pseudoephedrine have been specifically studied .
Initial doses of adrenergic agents , such as dopamine or epinephrine , should be reduced and titrated to achieve the desired response .
Serotonergic Agents : Co - administration of linezolid and serotonergic agents was not associated with serotonin syndrome in Phase 1 , 2 or 3 studies .
Spontaneous reports of serotonin syndrome associated with co - administration of ZYVOX and serotonergic agents , including antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) , have been reported .
Patients who are treated with ZYVOX and concomitant serotonergic agents should be closely observed as described in the PRECAUTIONS , General Section .
Strong CYP450 Inducers : In a study in healthy volunteers , co - administration of rifampin with oral linezolid resulted in a 21 % decrease in linezolid Cmax and a 32 % decrease in linezolid AUC0 – 12 .
The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown .
Other strong inducers of hepatic enzymes ( e . g . carbamazepine , phenytoin , phenobarbital ) could cause a similar or smaller decrease in linezolid exposure ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Drug - Drug Interactions ) Drug - Laboratory Test Interactions There are no reported drug - laboratory test interactions .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Lifetime studies in animals have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of linezolid .
Neither mutagenic nor clastogenic potential was found in a battery of tests including : assays for mutagenicity ( Ames bacterial reversion and CHO cell mutation ) , an in vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis ( UDS ) assay , an in vitro chromosome aberration assay in human lymphocytes , and an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
Linezolid did not affect the fertility or reproductive performance of adult female rats .
It reversibly decreased fertility and reproductive performance in adult male rats when given at doses ≥ 50 mg / kg / day , with exposures approximately equal to or greater than the expected human exposure level ( exposure comparisons are based on AUCs ) .
The reversible fertility effects were mediated through altered spermatogenesis .
Affected spermatids contained abnormally formed and oriented mitochondria and were non - viable .
Epithelial cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia in the epididymis was observed in conjunction with decreased fertility .
Similar epididymal changes were not seen in dogs .
In sexually mature male rats exposed to drug as juveniles , mildly decreased fertility was observed following treatment with linezolid through most of their period of sexual development ( 50 mg / kg / day from days 7 to 36 of age , and 100 mg / kg / day from days 37 to 55 of age ) , with exposures up to 1 . 7 - fold greater than mean AUCs observed in pediatric patients aged 3 months to 11 years .
Decreased fertility was not observed with shorter treatment periods , corresponding to exposure in utero through the early neonatal period ( gestation day 6 through postnatal day 5 ) , neonatal exposure ( postnatal days 5 to 21 ) , or to juvenile exposure ( postnatal days 22 to 35 ) .
Reversible reductions in sperm motility and altered sperm morphology were observed in rats treated from postnatal day 22 to 35 .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects .
Pregnancy Category C Linezolid was not teratogenic in mice , rats , or rabbits at exposure levels 6 . 5 - fold ( in mice ) , equivalent to ( in rats ) , or 0 . 06 - fold ( in rabbits ) the expected human exposure level , based on AUCs .
However , embryo and fetal toxicities were seen ( see Non - teratogenic Effects ) .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
ZYVOX should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Non - teratogenic Effects In mice , embryo and fetal toxicities were seen only at doses that caused maternal toxicity ( clinical signs and reduced body weight gain ) .
A dose of 450 mg / kg / day ( 6 . 5 - fold the estimated human exposure level based on AUCs ) correlated with increased postimplantational embryo death , including total litter loss , decreased fetal body weights , and an increased incidence of costal cartilage fusion .
In rats , mild fetal toxicity was observed at 15 and 50 mg / kg / day ( exposure levels 0 . 22 - fold to approximately equivalent to the estimated human exposure , respectively based on AUCs ) .
The effects consisted of decreased fetal body weights and reduced ossification of sternebrae , a finding often seen in association with decreased fetal body weights .
Slight maternal toxicity , in the form of reduced body weight gain , was seen at 50 mg / kg / day .
In rabbits , reduced fetal body weight occurred only in the presence of maternal toxicity ( clinical signs , reduced body weight gain and food consumption ) when administered at a dose of 15 mg / kg / day ( 0 . 06 - fold the estimated human exposure based on AUCs ) .
When female rats were treated with 50 mg / kg / day ( approximately equivalent to the estimated human exposure based on AUCs ) of linezolid during pregnancy and lactation , survival of pups was decreased on postnatal days 1 to 4 .
Male and female pups permitted to mature to reproductive age , when mated , showed an increase in preimplantation loss .
Nursing Mothers Linezolid and its metabolites are excreted in the milk of lactating rats .
Concentrations in milk were similar to those in maternal plasma .
It is not known whether linezolid is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when ZYVOX is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ZYVOX for the treatment of pediatric patients with the following infections are supported by evidence from adequate and well - controlled studies in adults , pharmacokinetic data in pediatric patients , and additional data from a comparator - controlled study of Gram - positive infections in pediatric patients ranging in age from birth through 11 years ( see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CLINICAL STUDIES ) : • nosocomial pneumonia • complicated skin and skin structure infections • community - acquired pneumonia ( also supported by evidence from an uncontrolled study in patients ranging in age from 8 months through 12 years ) • vancomycin - resistant Enterococcus faecium infections The safety and effectiveness of ZYVOX for the treatment of pediatric patients with the following infection have been established in a comparator - controlled study in pediatric patients ranging in age from 5 through 17 years ( see CLINICAL STUDIES ) : • uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus ( methicillin - susceptible strains only ) or Streptococcus pyogenes Pharmacokinetic information generated in pediatric patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts showed variable cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) linezolid concentrations following single and multiple dosing of linezolid ; therapeutic concentrations were not consistently achieved or maintained in the CSF .
Therefore , the use of linezolid for the empiric treatment of pediatric patients with central nervous system infections is not recommended .
The Cmax and the volume of distribution ( Vss ) of linezolid are similar regardless of age in pediatric patients .
However , linezolid clearance is a function of age .
Excluding neonates less than a week of age , clearance is most rapid in the youngest age groups ranging from > 1 week old to 11 years , resulting in lower single - dose systemic exposure ( AUC ) and shorter half - life as compared with adults .
As age of pediatric patients increases , the clearance of linezolid gradually decreases , and by adolescence , mean clearance values approach those observed for the adult population .
There is wider inter - subject variability in linezolid clearance and in systemic drug exposure ( AUC ) across all pediatric age groups as compared with adults .
Similar mean daily AUC values were observed in pediatric patients from birth to 11 years of age dosed q8h relative to adolescents or adults dosed q12h .
Therefore , the dosage for pediatric patients up to 11 years of age should be 10 mg / kg q8h .
Pediatric patients 12 years and older should receive 600 mg q12h .
Recommendations for the dosage regimen for pre - term neonates less than 7 days of age ( gestational age less than 34 weeks ) are based on pharmacokinetic data from 9 pre - term neonates .
Most of these pre - term neonates have lower systemic linezolid clearance values and larger AUC values than many full - term neonates and older infants .
Therefore , these pre - term neonates should be initiated with a dosing regimen of 10 mg / kg q12h .
Consideration may be given to the use of a 10 mg / kg q8h regimen in neonates with a sub - optimal clinical response .
All neonatal patients should receive 10 mg / kg q8h by 7 days of life ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Special Populations , Pediatric and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
In limited clinical experience , 5 out of 6 ( 83 % ) pediatric patients with infections due to Gram - positive pathogens with MICs of 4 µg / mL treated with ZYVOX had clinical cures .
However , pediatric patients exhibit wider variability in linezolid clearance and systemic exposure ( AUC ) compared with adults .
In pediatric patients with a sub - optimal clinical response , particularly those with pathogens with MIC of 4 µg / mL , lower systemic exposure , site and severity of infection , and the underlying medical condition should be considered when assessing clinical response ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Special Populations , Pediatric and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Geriatric Use Of the 2046 patients treated with ZYVOX in Phase 3 comparator - controlled clinical trials , 589 ( 29 % ) were 65 years or older and 253 ( 12 % ) were 75 years or older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients .
ANIMAL PHARMACOLOGY Target organs of linezolid toxicity were similar in juvenile and adult rats and dogs .
Dose - and time - dependent myelosuppression , as evidenced by bone marrow hypocellularity / decreased hematopoiesis , decreased extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen and liver , and decreased levels of circulating erythrocytes , leukocytes , and platelets have been seen in animal studies .
Lymphoid depletion occurred in thymus , lymph nodes , and spleen .
Generally , the lymphoid findings were associated with anorexia , weight loss , and suppression of body weight gain , which may have contributed to the observed effects .
In rats administered linezolid orally for 6 months , non - reversible , minimal to mild axonal degeneration of sciatic nerves was observed at 80 mg / kg / day ; minimal degeneration of the sciatic nerve was also observed in 1 male at this dose level at a 3 - month interim necropsy .
Sensitive morphologic evaluation of perfusion - fixed tissues was conducted to investigate evidence of optic nerve degeneration .
Minimal to moderate optic nerve degeneration was evident in 2 male rats after 6 months of dosing , but the direct relationship to drug was equivocal because of the acute nature of the finding and its asymmetrical distribution .
The nerve degeneration observed was microscopically comparable to spontaneous unilateral optic nerve degeneration reported in aging rats and may be an exacerbation of common background change .
These effects were observed at exposure levels that are comparable to those observed in some human subjects .
The hematopoietic and lymphoid effects were reversible , although in some studies , reversal was incomplete within the duration of the recovery period .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Adult Patients The safety of ZYVOX formulations was evaluated in 2046 adult patients enrolled in seven Phase 3 comparator - controlled clinical trials , who were treated for up to 28 days .
In these studies , 85 % of the adverse events reported with ZYVOX were described as mild to moderate in intensity .
Table 6 shows the incidence of adverse events reported in at least 2 % of patients in these trials .
The most common adverse events in patients treated with ZYVOX were diarrhea ( incidence across studies : 2 . 8 % to 11 . 0 % ) , headache ( incidence across studies : 0 . 5 % to 11 . 3 % ) , and nausea ( incidence across studies : 3 . 4 % to 9 . 6 % ) .

[ 2 ] The most commonly reported drug - related adverse events leading to discontinuation in patients treated with ZYVOX were nausea , headache , diarrhea , and vomiting .
Pediatric Patients The safety of ZYVOX formulations was evaluated in 215 pediatric patients ranging in age from birth through 11 years , and in 248 pediatric patients aged 5 through 17 years ( 146 of these 248 were age 5 through 11 and 102 were age 12 to 17 ) .
These patients were enrolled in two Phase 3 comparator - controlled clinical trials and were treated for up to 28 days .
In these studies , 83 % and 99 % , respectively , of the adverse events reported with ZYVOX were described as mild to moderate in intensity .
In the study of hospitalized pediatric patients ( birth through 11 years ) with Gram - positive infections , who were randomized 2 to 1 ( linezolid : vancomycin ) , mortality was 6 . 0 % ( 13 / 215 ) in the linezolid arm and 3 . 0 % ( 3 / 101 ) in the vancomycin arm .
However , given the severe underlying illness in the patient population , no causality could be established .
Table 8 shows the incidence of adverse events reported in at least 2 % of pediatric patients treated with ZYVOX in these trials .

[ 2 ] Patients from birth through 11 years of age received ZYVOX 10 mg / kg IV / PO q8h or vancomycin 10 to 15 mg / kg IV q6 – 24 h , depending on age and renal clearance .
Table 9 shows the incidence of drug - related adverse events reported in more than 1 % of pediatric patients ( and more than 1 patient ) in either treatment group in the comparator - controlled Phase 3 trials .

Patients 12 years or older received ZYVOX 600 mg PO q12h or cefadroxil 500 mg PO q12h .
[ 2 ] Patients from birth through 11 years of age received ZYVOX 10 mg / kg IV / PO q8h or vancomycin 10 to 15 mg / kg IV q6 – 24 h , depending on age and renal clearance .
[ 3 ] These reports were of ' red - man syndrome ' , which were coded as anaphylaxis .
Laboratory Changes ZYVOX has been associated with thrombocytopenia when used in doses up to and including 600 mg every 12 hours for up to 28 days .
In Phase 3 comparator - controlled trials , the percentage of adult patients who developed a substantially low platelet count ( defined as less than 75 % of lower limit of normal and / or baseline ) was 2 . 4 % ( range among studies : 0 . 3 to 10 . 0 % ) with ZYVOX and 1 . 5 % ( range among studies : 0 . 4 to 7 . 0 % ) with a comparator .
In a study of hospitalized pediatric patients ranging in age from birth through 11 years , the percentage of patients who developed a substantially low platelet count ( defined as less than 75 % of lower limit of normal and / or baseline ) was 12 . 9 % with ZYVOX and 13 . 4 % with vancomycin .
In an outpatient study of pediatric patients aged from 5 through 17 years , the percentage of patients who developed a substantially low platelet count was 0 % with ZYVOX and 0 . 4 % with cefadroxil .
Thrombocytopenia associated with the use of ZYVOX appears to be dependent on duration of therapy , ( generally greater than 2 weeks of treatment ) .
The platelet counts for most patients returned to the normal range / baseline during the follow - up period .
No related clinical adverse events were identified in Phase 3 clinical trials in patients developing thrombocytopenia .
Bleeding events were identified in thrombocytopenic patients in a compassionate use program for ZYVOX ; the role of linezolid in these events cannot be determined ( see WARNINGS ) .
Changes seen in other laboratory parameters , without regard to drug relationship , revealed no substantial differences between ZYVOX and the comparators .
These changes were generally not clinically significant , did not lead to discontinuation of therapy , and were reversible .
The incidence of adult and pediatric patients with at least one substantially abnormal hematologic or serum chemistry value is presented in Tables 10 , 11 , 12 , and 13 .

Postmarketing Experience Myelosuppression ( including anemia , leukopenia , pancytopenia , and thrombocytopenia ) has been reported during postmarketing use of ZYVOX ( see WARNINGS ) .
Peripheral neuropathy , and optic neuropathy sometimes progressing to loss of vision , have been reported in patients treated with ZYVOX .
Lactic acidosis has been reported with the use of ZYVOX ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
Although these reports have primarily been in patients treated for longer than the maximum recommended duration of 28 days , these events have also been reported in patients receiving shorter courses of therapy .
Serotonin syndrome has been reported in patients receiving concomitant serotonergic agents , including antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) and ZYVOX ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
Convulsions have been reported with the use of ZYVOX ( see PRECAUTIONS ) .
Anaphylaxis , angioedema , and bullous skin disorders such as those described as Stevens Johnson syndrome have been reported .
Superficial tooth discoloration and tongue discoloration have been reported with the use of linezolid .
The tooth discoloration was removable with professional dental cleaning ( manual descaling ) in cases with known outcome .
These events have been chosen for inclusion due to either their seriousness , frequency of reporting , possible causal connection to ZYVOX , or a combination of these factors .
Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , estimates of frequency cannot be made and causal relationship cannot be precisely established .
OVERDOSAGE In the event of overdosage , supportive care is advised , with maintenance of glomerular filtration .
Hemodialysis may facilitate more rapid elimination of linezolid .
In a Phase 1 clinical trial , approximately 30 % of a dose of linezolid was removed during a 3 - hour hemodialysis session beginning 3 hours after the dose of linezolid was administered .
Data are not available for removal of linezolid with peritoneal dialysis or hemoperfusion .
Clinical signs of acute toxicity in animals were decreased activity and ataxia in rats and vomiting and tremors in dogs treated with 3000 mg / kg / day and 2000 mg / kg / day , respectively .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The recommended dosage for ZYVOX formulations for the treatment of infections is described in Table 14 .
Table 14 .
Dosage Guidelines for ZYVOXInfection [ 1 ] Dosage and Route of Administration Recommended Duration of Treatment ( consecutive days ) Pediatric Patients [ 2 ] ( Birth through 11 Years of Age ) Adults and Adolescents ( 12 Years and Older ) Complicated skin and skin structure infections 10 mg / kg IV or oral [ 3 ] q8h 600 mg IV or oral null q12h 10 to 14 Community - acquired pneumonia , including concurrent bacteremia Nosocomial pneumonia Vancomycin - resistant Enterococcus faecium infections , including concurrent bacteremia 10 mg / kg IV or oral null q8h 600 mg IV or oral null q12h 14 to 28 Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections < 5 yrs : 10 mg / kg oral null q8h 5 – 11 yrs : 10 mg / kg oral null q12h Adults : 400 mg oral null q12h Adolescents : 600 mg oral null q12h 10 to 14 [ 1 ] Due to the designated pathogens ( see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ) [ 2 ] Neonates < 7 days : Most pre - term neonates < 7 days of age ( gestational age < 34 weeks ) have lower systemic linezolid clearance values and larger AUC values than many full - term neonates and older infants .
These neonates should be initiated with a dosing regimen of 10 mg / kg q12h .
Consideration may be given to the use of 10 mg / kg q8h regimen in neonates with a sub - optimal clinical response .
All neonatal patients should receive 10 mg / kg q8h by 7 days of life ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Special Populations , Pediatric ) .
[ 3 ] Oral dosing using either ZYVOX Tablets or ZYVOX for Oral Suspension Adult patients with infection due to MRSA should be treated with ZYVOX 600 mg q12h .
In limited clinical experience , 5 out of 6 ( 83 % ) pediatric patients with infections due to Gram - positive pathogens with MICs of 4 µg / mL treated with ZYVOX had clinical cures .
However , pediatric patients exhibit wider variability in linezolid clearance and systemic exposure ( AUC ) compared with adults .
In pediatric patients with a sub - optimal clinical response , particularly those with pathogens with MIC of 4 µg / mL , lower systemic exposure , site and severity of infection , and the underlying medical condition should be considered when assessing clinical response ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Special Populations , Pediatric and PRECAUTIONS , Pediatric Use ) .
In controlled clinical trials , the protocol - defined duration of treatment for all infections ranged from 7 to 28 days .
Total treatment duration was determined by the treating physician based on site and severity of the infection , and on the patient ' s clinical response .
No dose adjustment is necessary when switching from intravenous to oral administration .
Patients whose therapy is started with ZYVOX I . V . Injection may be switched to either ZYVOX Tablets or Oral Suspension at the discretion of the physician , when clinically indicated .
Intravenous Administration ZYVOX I . V . Injection is supplied in single - use , ready - to - use infusion bags ( see HOW SUPPLIED for container sizes ) .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter prior to administration .
Check for minute leaks by firmly squeezing the bag .

ZYVOX I . V . Injection should be administered by intravenous infusion over a period of 30 to 120 minutes .
Do not use this intravenous infusion bag in series connections .
Additives should not be introduced into this solution .
If ZYVOX I . V . Injection is to be given concomitantly with another drug , each drug should be given separately in accordance with the recommended dosage and route of administration for each product .
In particular , physical incompatibilities resulted when ZYVOX I . V . Injection was combined with the following drugs during simulated Y - site administration : amphotericin B , chlorpromazine HCl , diazepam , pentamidine isothionate , erythromycin lactobionate , phenytoin sodium , and trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole .
Additionally , chemical incompatibility resulted when ZYVOX I . V . Injection was combined with ceftriaxone sodium .
If the same intravenous line is used for sequential infusion of several drugs , the line should be flushed before and after infusion of ZYVOX I . V . Injection with an infusion solution compatible with ZYVOX I . V . Injection and with any other drug ( s ) administered via this common line ( see Compatible Intravenous Solutions ) .

CLINICAL STUDIES Adults Vancomycin - Resistant Enterococcal Infections Adult patients with documented or suspected vancomycin - resistant enterococcal infection were enrolled in a randomized , multi - center , double - blind trial comparing a high dose of ZYVOX ( 600 mg ) with a low dose of ZYVOX ( 200 mg ) given every 12 hours ( q12h ) either intravenously ( IV ) or orally for 7 to 28 days .
Patients could receive concomitant aztreonam or aminoglycosides .
There were 79 patients randomized to high - dose linezolid and 66 to low - dose linezolid .
The intent - to - treat ( ITT ) population with documented vancomycin - resistant enterococcal infection at baseline consisted of 65 patients in the high - dose arm and 52 in the low - dose arm .
The cure rates for the ITT population with documented vancomycin - resistant enterococcal infection at baseline are presented in Table 15 by source of infection .
These cure rates do not include patients with missing or indeterminate outcomes .
The cure rate was higher in the high - dose arm than in the low - dose arm , although the difference was not statistically significant at the 0 . 05 level .

This was a randomized , open - label trial in hospitalized adult patients with documented or suspected MRSA infection .
One group of patients received ZYVOX I . V . Injection 600 mg q12h followed by ZYVOX Tablets 600 mg q12h .
The other group of patients received vancomycin 1 g q12h IV .
Both groups were treated for 7 to 28 days , and could receive concomitant aztreonam or gentamicin if clinically indicated .
The cure rates in microbiologically evaluable patients with MRSA skin and skin structure infection were 26 / 33 ( 79 % ) for linezolid - treated patients and 24 / 33 ( 73 % ) for vancomycin - treated patients .
Diabetic Foot Infections Adult diabetic patients with clinically documented complicated skin and skin structure infections ( " diabetic foot infections " ) were enrolled in a randomized ( 2 : 1 ratio ) , multi - center , open - label trial comparing study medications administered IV or orally for a total of 14 to 28 days of treatment .
One group of patients received ZYVOX 600 mg q12h IV or orally ; the other group received ampicillin / sulbactam 1 . 5 to 3 g IV or amoxicillin / clavulanate 500 to 875 mg every 8 to 12 hours ( q8 – 12 h ) orally .
In countries where ampicillin / sulbactam is not marketed , amoxicillin / clavulanate 500 mg to 2 g every 6 hours ( q6h ) was used for the intravenous regimen .
Patients in the comparator group could also be treated with vancomycin 1 g q12h IV if MRSA was isolated from the foot infection .
Patients in either treatment group who had Gram - negative bacilli isolated from the infection site could also receive aztreonam 1 to 2 g q8 – 12 h IV .
All patients were eligible to receive appropriate adjunctive treatment methods , such as debridement and off - loading , as typically required in the treatment of diabetic foot infections , and most patients received these treatments .
There were 241 linezolid - treated and 120 comparator - treated patients in the intent - to - treat ( ITT ) study population .
Two hundred twelve ( 86 % ) linezolid - treated patients and 105 ( 85 % ) comparator - treated patients were clinically evaluable .
In the ITT population , the cure rates were 68 . 5 % ( 165 / 241 ) in linezolid - treated patients and 64 % ( 77 / 120 ) in comparator - treated patients , where those with indeterminate and missing outcomes were considered failures .
The cure rates in the clinically evaluable patients ( excluding those with indeterminate and missing outcomes ) were 83 % ( 159 / 192 ) and 73 % ( 74 / 101 ) in the linezolid - and comparator - treated patients , respectively .
A critical post - hoc analysis focused on 121 linezolid - treated and 60 comparator - treated patients who had a Gram - positive pathogen isolated from the site of infection or from blood , who had less evidence of underlying osteomyelitis than the overall study population , and who did not receive prohibited antimicrobials .
Based upon that analysis , the cure rates were 71 % ( 86 / 121 ) in the linezolid - treated patients and 63 % ( 38 / 60 ) in the comparator - treated patients .
None of the above analyses were adjusted for the use of adjunctive therapies .
The cure rates by pathogen for microbiologically evaluable patients are presented in Table 19 .

Pediatric Patients Infections Due to Gram - positive Organisms A safety and efficacy study provided experience on the use of ZYVOX in pediatric patients for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia , complicated skin and skin structure infections , catheter - related bacteremia , bacteremia of unidentified source , and other infections due to Gram - positive bacterial pathogens , including methicillin - resistant and - susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin - resistant Enterococcus faecium .
Pediatric patients ranging in age from birth through 11 years with infections caused by the documented or suspected Gram - positive organisms were enrolled in a randomized , open - label , comparator - controlled trial .
One group of patients received ZYVOX I . V . Injection 10 mg / kg every 8 hours ( q8h ) followed by ZYVOX for Oral Suspension 10 mg / kg q8h .
A second group received vancomycin 10 to 15 mg / kg IV every 6 to 24 hours , depending on age and renal clearance .
Patients who had confirmed VRE infections were placed in a third arm of the study and received ZYVOX 10 mg / kg q8h IV and / or orally .
All patients were treated for a total of 10 to 28 days and could receive concomitant Gram - negative antibiotics if clinically indicated .
In the intent - to - treat ( ITT ) population , there were 206 patients randomized to linezolid and 102 patients randomized to vancomycin .
One hundred seventeen ( 57 % ) linezolid - treated patients and 55 ( 54 % ) vancomycin - treated patients were clinically evaluable .
The cure rates in ITT patients were 81 % in patients randomized to linezolid and 83 % in patients randomized to vancomycin ( 95 % Confidence Interval of the treatment difference ; - 13 % , 8 % ) .
The cure rates in clinically evaluable patients were 91 % in linezolid - treated patients and 91 % in vancomycin - treated patients ( 95 % CI ; - 11 % , 11 % ) .
Modified intent - to - treat ( MITT ) patients included ITT patients who , at baseline , had a Gram - positive pathogen isolated from the site of infection or from blood .
The cure rates in MITT patients were 80 % in patients randomized to linezolid and 90 % in patients randomized to vancomycin ( 95 % CI ; - 23 % , 3 % ) .
The cure rates for ITT , MITT , and clinically evaluable patients are presented in Table 20 .
After the study was completed , 13 additional patients ranging from 4 days through 16 years of age were enrolled in an open - label extension of the VRE arm of the study .
