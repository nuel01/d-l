2 . 5 Imaging Guidelines • Instruct the patient to void immediately before imaging , 70 minutes post administration .
• Start imaging at about 80 minutes post administration ( with a 9 second CT scan for attenuation correction ) followed by 3 D PET scan from 80 to 100 minutes post administration .
2 . 6 Image Interpretation Fluorodopa F 18 PET scans are interpreted visually , based upon the appearance and shape of the putamen and caudate of the striatum .
Optimum presentation of the reconstructed images for visual interpretation is transaxial slices parallel to the anterior commissure - posterior commissure ( AC - PC ) line .
Determination of whether an image is negative or positive is made by assessing the shape and intensity of the striatal signal ( see Figure 1 and 2 ) .
Image interpretation does not involve integration of the image with clinical signs and / or symptoms .
Negative Scans : A full crescent shaped putamen and caudate image ( see Figure 1 ) .
FDOPA uptake is clearly delineated from the background activity in the brain .
It is bilaterally symmetrical and of uniform thickness in both caudate and putamen ( comma - or crescent - shaped ) .
Figure 1 : Negative Scan [ MULTIMEDIA ] Positive Scans : A reduction in the size and shape of putamen ( unilaterally or bilaterally ) or both putamen and caudate ( unilaterally or bilaterally ) .
All of the following are considered positive : • FDOPA uptake is asymmetric in the putamen ; normal on one side but reduced on the contralateral side with respect to the background , especially in the posterior part .
Caudate uptake is symmetrical on both sides and clearly delineated from the background ( see Figure 2 , A ) .
• FDOPA uptake is bilaterally reduced in the putamen ( see Figure 2 , B ) .
• FDOPA uptake is bilaterally reduced in the putamen and in the caudate nuclei ( see Figure 2 , C ) .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval of use of Fluorodopa F 18 Injection outside of the United States .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : Pain 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Aromatic L - amino acid decarboxylase ( AADC ) inhibitors Prior to Fluorodopa F 18 Injection administration , use of AADC inhibitors ( e . g . carbidopa , benserazide etc . ) may increase Fluorodopa F 18 bioavailability to the brain by inhibiting peripheral decarboxylase activity and restricting peripheral Fluorodopa F 18 metabolism [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Dopamine agonists , dopamine reuptake inhibitors , dopamine releasing agents ( DRAs ) , peripheral catechol - O - methyltransferase ( COMT ) inhibitors , and monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitors Therapy for Parkinson ’ s syndromes includes dopamine agonists , dopamine reuptake inhibitors , dopamine releasing agents ( DRAs ) such as psychostimulants of the amphetamine class , peripheral catechol - O - methyltransferase ( COMT ) inhibitors , and monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitors .
Whether discontinuation of these drugs prior to Fluorodopa F 18 administration may minimize the interference with a Fluorodopa F 18 image is not fully known ; however , if use of these drugs can be safely suspended , discontinue use 12 hours before administration of Fluorodopa F18 Injection [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : To decrease radiation exposure to a nursing infant , advise a lactating woman to pump and discard breastmilk for at least 24 hours ( 12 half - lives ) after administration of Fluorodopa F 18 Injection .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on Fluorodopa F 18 Injection use in pregnant women .
Additionally , animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with Fluorodopa F 18 Injection .
However , all radiopharmaceuticals , including Fluorodopa F 18 Injection , have a potential to cause fetal harm depending on the stage of fetal development , and the magnitude of the radiation dose .
If considering Fluorodopa F 18 Injection administration to a pregnant woman , inform the patient about the potential for adverse pregnancy outcomes based on the radiation dose from the drug and the gestational timing of exposure .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies are 2 to 4 % and 15 to 20 % , respectively , regardless of drug exposure .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary No data are available regarding the presence of Fluorodopa F 18 Injection in human milk , the effects of the drug on the breastfed child , or the effects of the drug on milk production .
Exposure of Fluorodopa F 18 Injection to a breast fed infant can be minimized by temporary discontinuation of breastfeeding [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for Fluorodopa F 18 Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Fluorodopa F 18 Injection or from the underlying maternal condition .
The body of scientific information related to radioactivity decay , drug tissue distribution and drug elimination shows that less than 0 . 01 % of the radioactivity administered remains in the body after 24 hours .
Clinical Considerations To decrease radiation exposure to a nursing infant , advise a lactating woman to pump and discard breastmilk for at least 24 hours ( 12 half - lives ) after administration of Fluorodopa F 18 Injection .

The accumulation of F 18 FDA in the striatum is visually detected in the PET scan .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Optimal PET imaging is achieved between 75 to 90 minutes after administration of Fluorodopa F 18 Injection based on its pharmacokinetics .
The relationship between Fluorodopa F 18 dose and plasma concentration is not fully characterized .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Distribution Following the intravenous administration , Fluorodopa F 18 is cleared from the blood with a biologic half - life of about 1 to 3 hours .
The time course of “ background ” brain radioactivity after Fluorodopa F 18 was evaluated .
F 18 activity in the cerebellum was greater than the parietal or occipital cortex during the first 30 minutes after Fluorodopa F 18 suggesting regional differences in amino acid transport .
Elimination Fluorodopa F 18 is cleared from the blood and tissue within 24 hours .
Metabolism : Fluorodopa F 18 is decarboxylated by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase in the striatum to Fluorodopamine F 18 .
Fluorodopamine F 18 is also metabolized via monoamine oxidase to yield [ 18 F ] 6 - fluoro - 3 , 4 - dihydroxyphenylacetic acid ( 18 FDOPAC ) and subsequently by COMT to yield [ 18 F ] 6 - fluorohomovanillic acid ( 18 FHVA ) .
Elimination : 80 % of the radioactivity is eliminated through the urine .
Urine radioactivity peaks at about 30 minutes post - injection .
The radiation absorbed dose to the bladder wall is reduced by emptying the bladder just before scanning .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of F - 18 FDOPA were evaluated in a prospective single - arm study conducted at a single center that enrolled 68 adult patients with possible Parkinsonian syndrome ( PS ) .
In the study , F - 18 FDOPA image reads were compared to a reference clinical diagnostic standard of Parkinsonian syndrome or non - Parkinsonian syndrome ( non - PS ) established at 6 to 9 months after the F - 18 FDOPA PET scan by a movement disorder specialist blinded to F - 18 FDOPA PET results .
The reference clinical diagnostic standard for PS included Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) , progressive supranuclear palsy ( PSP ) , corticobasal degeneration ( CBD ) , and multiple system atrophy ( MSA ) .
These conditions have been associated with dopaminergic neurodegeneration and F - 18 FDOPA PET imaging was not designed to distinguish among the conditions .
The reference clinical diagnostic standard for non - PS included essential tremor ( ET ) diagnosis , vascular parkinsonism , drug - induced parkinsonism , and other non - PS diagnoses .
Carbidopa ( 150 mg ) was administered orally to patients approximately 60 minutes prior to the administration of Fluorodopa F 18 Injection .
Each patient was injected 5 mCi F - 18 FDOPA ( range 4 . 5 - 5 . 5 mCi ) , and PET images were acquired 80 - 100 minutes post injection .
F - 18 FDOPA PET images were evaluated independently by 3 readers blinded to clinical information who had no other role in patient assessment .
Patients with at least one cardinal feature of PS were referred to the study by physicians who were uncertain of a diagnosis .
Thirty - three of these patients had symptoms for 2 years or less .
Fifty - six of these patients completed F - 18 FDOPA PET imaging and at least 6 month clinical follow - up .
Among these 56 patients , 32 % were female and 68 % were male .
Mean patient age was 66 years .
Thirty - three patients were categorized as PS , and twenty - three patients were categorized as non - PS based on minimum 6 month clinical follow - up by a movement disorder specialist .
Table 5 shows the positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement of F - 18 FDOPA Injection PET image results with the reference clinical diagnostic standard .
Positive percent agreement represents the percent of patients with positive F - 18 FDOPA PET images among all the patients with a clinical diagnostic reference standard of PS .
Negative percent agreement represents the percent of patients with negative F - 18 FDOPA PET images among the patients with a non - PS clinical diagnostic reference standard .
