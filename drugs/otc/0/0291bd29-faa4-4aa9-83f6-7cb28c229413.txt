1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE CRESTOR is an HMG Co ‑ A reductase inhibitor indicated for : • • patients with primary hyperlipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia as an adjunct to diet to reduce elevated total ‑ C , LDL ‑ C , ApoB , nonHDL ‑ C , and TG levels and to increase HDL ‑ C ( 1 . 1 ) • • patients with hypertriglyceridemia as an adjunct to diet ( 1 . 2 ) • • patients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia ( Type III hyperlipoproteinemia ) as an adjunct to diet ( 1 . 3 ) • • patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ( HoFH ) to reduce LDL ‑ C , total - C , and ApoB ( 1 . 4 ) • • slowing the progression of atherosclerosis as part of a treatment strategy to lower total ‑ C and LDL ‑ C as an adjunct to diet ( 1 . 5 ) • • pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ( HeFH ) to reduce elevated total ‑ C , LDL ‑ C and ApoB after failing an adequate trial of diet therapy ( 1 . 1 ) • • risk reduction of MI , stroke , and arterial revascularization procedures in patients without clinically evident CHD , but with multiple risk factors ( 1 . 6 ) Limitations of use ( 1 . 7 ) : • • CRESTOR has not been studied in Fredrickson Type I and V dyslipidemias .
1 . 1 Hyperlipidemia and Mixed Dyslipidemia CRESTOR is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated Total - C , LDL - C , ApoB , nonHDL ‑ C , and triglycerides and to increase HDL ‑ C in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia .
Lipid - altering agents should be used in addition to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol when response to diet and nonpharmacological interventions alone has been inadequate .
Pediatric Patients 10 to 17 years of age with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia ( HeFH ) Adjunct to diet to reduce Total ‑ C , LDL ‑ C and ApoB levels in adolescent boys and girls , who are at least one year post - menarche , 10 ‑ 17 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia if after an adequate trial of diet therapy the following findings are present : LDL ‑ C > 190 mg / dL or > 160 mg / dL and there is a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) or two or more other CVD risk factors .
1 . 2 Hypertriglyceridemia CRESTOR is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for the treatment of adult patients with hypertriglyceridemia .
1 . 3 Primary Dysbetalipoproteinemia ( Type III Hyperlipoproteinemia ) CRESTOR is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the treatment of patients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia ( Type III Hyperlipoproteinemia ) .
1 . 4 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia CRESTOR is indicated as adjunctive therapy to other lipid - lowering treatments ( e . g . , LDL apheresis ) or alone if such treatments are unavailable to reduce LDL ‑ C , Total ‑ C , and ApoB in adult patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia .
1 . 5 Slowing of the Progression of Atherosclerosis CRESTOR is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet to slow the progression of atherosclerosis in adult patients as part of a treatment strategy to lower Total ‑ C and LDL ‑ C to target levels .
1 . 6 Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In individuals without clinically evident coronary heart disease but with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease based on age ≥ 50 years old in men and ≥ 60 years old in women , hsCRP ≥ 2 mg / L , and the presence of at least one additional cardiovascular disease risk factor such as hypertension , low HDL ‑ C , smoking , or a family history of premature coronary heart disease , CRESTOR is indicated to : • • reduce the risk of stroke • • reduce the risk of myocardial infarction • • reduce the risk of arterial revascularization procedures 1 . 7 Limitations of Use CRESTOR has not been studied in Fredrickson Type I and V dyslipidemias .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • • CRESTOR can be taken with or without food , at any time of day .
( 2 . 1 ) • • Dose range : 5 ‑ 40 mg once daily .
Use 40 mg dose only for patients not reaching LDL ‑ C goal with 20 mg .
( 2 . 1 ) • • HoFH : Starting dose 20 mg .
( 2 . 3 ) • • In pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age with HeFH , the usual dose range is 5 ‑ 20 mg / day ; doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population .
( 2 . 2 ) 2 . 1 General Dosing Information The dose range for CRESTOR is 5 to 40 mg orally once daily .
The usual starting dose is 10 ‑ 20 mg .
CRESTOR can be administered as a single dose at any time of day , with or without food .
When initiating CRESTOR therapy or switching from another HMG ‑ CoA reductase inhibitor therapy , the appropriate CRESTOR starting dose should first be utilized , and only then titrated according to the patient ’ s response and individualized goal of therapy .
After initiation or upon titration of CRESTOR , lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and the dosage adjusted accordingly .
The 40 mg dose of CRESTOR should be used only for those patients who have not achieved their LDL ‑ C goal utilizing the 20 mg dose [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
2 . 2 Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia in Pediatric Patients ( 10 to 17 years of age ) The usual dose range of CRESTOR is 5 ‑ 20 mg / day ; the maximum recommended dose is 20 mg / day ( doses greater than 20 mg have not been studied in this patient population ) .
Doses should be individualized according to the recommended goal of therapy [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 ) and Indications and Usage ( 1 . 2 ) ] .
Adjustments should be made at intervals of 4 weeks or more .
2 . 3 Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia The recommended starting dose of CRESTOR is 20 mg once daily .
Response to therapy should be estimated from preapheresis LDL ‑ C levels .
2 . 4 Dosing in Asian Patients In Asian patients , consider initiation of CRESTOR therapy with 5 mg once daily due to increased rosuvastatin plasma concentrations .
The increased systemic exposure should be taken into consideration when treating Asian patients not adequately controlled at doses up to 20 mg / day .
[ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 8 ) andClinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 5 Use with Concomitant Therapy Patients taking cyclosporine The dose of CRESTOR should not exceed 5 mg once daily [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] Patients taking gemfibrozil Initiate CRESTOR therapy with 5 mg once daily .
The dose of CRESTOR should not exceed 10 mg once daily [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Patients taking lopinavir and ritonavir or atazanavir and ritonavir Initiate CRESTOR therapy with 5 mg once daily .
The dose of CRESTOR should not exceed 10 mg once daily [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , Drug Interactions ( 7 . 3 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 6 Dosing in Patients with Severe Renal Impairment For patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) not on hemodialysis , dosing of CRESTOR should be started at 5 mg once daily and not exceed 10 mg once daily [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

Tablets : 5 mg , 10 mg , 20 mg , and 40 mg ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS CRESTOR is contraindicated in the following conditions : • • Patients with a known hypersensitivity to any component of this product .
Hypersensitivity reactions including rash , pruritus , urticaria , and angioedema have been reported with CRESTOR [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
• • Patients with active liver disease , which may include unexplained persistent elevations of hepatic transaminase levels [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
• • Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant .
Because HMG ‑ CoA reductase inhibitors decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol , CRESTOR may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women .
Additionally , there is no apparent benefit to therapy during pregnancy , and safety in pregnant women has not been established .
If the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug , the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) and Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 2 ) ] .
• • Nursing mothers .
Because another drug in this class passes into breast milk , and because HMG ‑ CoA reductase inhibitors have the potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants , women who require CRESTOR treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 3 ) ] .
• • Known hypersensitivity to product components ( 4 ) • • Active liver disease , which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels ( 4 ) • • Women who are pregnant or may become pregnant ( 4 , 8 . 1 ) • • Nursing mothers ( 4 , 8 . 3 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Skeletal muscle effects ( e . g . , myopathy and rhabdomyolysis ) : Risks increase with use of 40 mg dose , advanced age ( ≥ 65 ) , hypothyroidism , renal impairment , and combination use with cyclosporine , lopinavir / ritonavir , or atazanavir / ritonavir .
Advise patients to promptly report to their physician unexplained and / or persistent muscle pain , tenderness , or weakness and discontinue CRESTOR if signs or symptoms appear .
( 5 . 1 , 7 . 5 , 7 . 6 ) • • Liver enzyme abnormalities : Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur .
Perform liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter .
( 5 . 2 ) 5 . 1 Skeletal Muscle Effects Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors , including CRESTOR .
These risks can occur at any dose level , but are increased at the highest dose ( 40 mg ) .
CRESTOR should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy ( e . g . , age ≥ 65 years , inadequately treated hypothyroidism , renal impairment ) .
The risk of myopathy during treatment with CRESTOR may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid - lowering therapies ( fibrates or niacin ) , gemfibrozil , cyclosporine , lopinavir / ritonavir , or atazanavir / ritonavir [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Cases of myopathy , including rhabdomyolysis , have been reported with HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors , including rosuvastatin , coadministered with colchicine , and caution should be exercised when prescribing CRESTOR with colchicine [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 7 ) ] .
CRESTOR therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated creatine kinase levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected .
CRESTOR therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient with an acute , serious condition suggestive of myopathy or predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis ( e . g . , sepsis , hypotension , dehydration , major surgery , trauma , severe metabolic , endocrine , and electrolyte disorders , or uncontrolled seizures ) .
There have been rare reports of immune - mediated necrotizing myopathy ( IMNM ) , an autoimmune myopathy , associated with statin use .
IMNM is characterized by : proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase , which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment ; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation ; improvement with immunosuppressive agents .
All patients should be advised to promptly report to their physician unexplained muscle pain , tenderness , or weakness , particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing CRESTOR .
5 . 2 Liver Enzyme Abnormalities It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be performed before the initiation of CRESTOR , and if signs or symptoms of liver injury occur .
Increases in serum transaminases [ AST ( SGOT ) or ALT ( SGPT ) ] have been reported with HMG ‑ CoA reductase inhibitors , including CRESTOR .
In most cases , the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy .
There were two cases of jaundice , for which a relationship to CRESTOR therapy could not be determined , which resolved after discontinuation of therapy .
There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials .
In a pooled analysis of placebo - controlled trials , increases in serum transaminases to > 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 1 . 1 % of patients taking CRESTOR versus 0 . 5 % of patients treated with placebo .
There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non - fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins , including rosuvastatin .
If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and / or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with CRESTOR , promptly interrupt therapy .
If an alternate etiology is not found , do not restart CRESTOR .
CRESTOR should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and / or have a history of chronic liver disease [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Active liver disease , which may include unexplained persistent transaminase elevations , is a contraindication to the use of CRESTOR [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
5 . 3 Concomitant Coumarin Anticoagulants Caution should be exercised when anticoagulants are given in conjunction with CRESTOR because of its potentiation of the effect of coumarin - type anticoagulants in prolonging the prothrombin time / INR .
In patients taking coumarin anticoagulants and CRESTOR concomitantly , INR should be determined before starting CRESTOR and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significant alteration of INR occurs [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 4 Proteinuria and Hematuria In the CRESTOR clinical trial program , dipstick - positive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were observed among CRESTOR treated patients .
These findings were more frequent in patients taking CRESTOR 40 mg , when compared to lower doses of CRESTOR or comparator HMG ‑ CoA reductase inhibitors , though it was generally transient and was not associated with worsening renal function .
Although the clinical significance of this finding is unknown , a dose reduction should be considered for patients on CRESTOR therapy with unexplained persistent proteinuria and / or hematuria during routine urinalysis testing .
5 . 5 Endocrine Effects Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG ‑ CoA reductase inhibitors , including CRESTOR .
Based on clinical trial data with CRESTOR , in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Although clinical studies have shown that CRESTOR alone does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve , caution should be exercised if CRESTOR is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones such as ketoconazole , spironolactone , and cimetidine .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label : • • Rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria and acute renal failure and myopathy ( including myositis ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] • • Liver enzyme abnormalities [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] In the CRESTOR controlled clinical trials database ( placebo or active - controlled ) of 5394 patients with a mean treatment duration of 15 weeks , 1 . 4 % of patients discontinued due to adverse reactions .
The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation were : • • myalgia • • abdominal pain • • nausea The most commonly reported adverse reactions ( incidence ≥ 2 % ) in the CRESTOR controlled clinical trial database of 5394 patients were : • • headache • • myalgia • • abdominal pain • • asthenia • • nausea Most frequent adverse reactions ( rate > 2 % ) are headache , myalgia , abdominal pain , asthenia , and nausea .

6 . 1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2 % of patients in placebo - controlled clinical studies and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 1 .
These studies had a treatment duration of up to 12 weeks .
• Table 1 .
Adverse Reactions1 Reported in ≥ 2 % of Patients Treated with CRESTOR and > Placebo in Placebo ‑ Controlled Trials ( % of Patients ) Adverse Reactions CRESTOR 5 mg N = 291 CRESTOR 10 mg N = 283 CRESTOR 20 mg N = 64 CRESTOR 40 mg N = 106 Total CRESTOR 5 mg ‑ 40 mg N = 744 Placebo N = 382 Headache 5 . 5 4 . 9 3 . 1 8 . 5 5 . 5 5 . 0 Nausea 3 . 8 3 . 5 6 . 3 0 3 . 4 3 . 1 Myalgia 3 . 1 2 . 1 6 . 3 1 . 9 2 . 8 1 . 3 Asthenia 2 . 4 3 . 2 4 . 7 0 . 9 2 . 7 2 . 6 Constipation 2 . 1 2 . 1 4 . 7 2 . 8 2 . 4 2 . 4 Other adverse reactions reported in clinical studies were abdominal pain , dizziness , hypersensitivity ( including rash , pruritus , urticaria , and angioedema ) and pancreatitis .
The following laboratory abnormalities have also been reported : dipstick - positive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] ; elevated creatine phosphokinase , transaminases , glucose , glutamyl transpeptidase , alkaline phosphatase , and bilirubin ; and thyroid function abnormalities .
In the METEOR study , involving 981 participants treated with rosuvastatin 40 mg ( n = 700 ) or placebo ( n = 281 ) with a mean treatment duration of 1 . 7 years , 5 . 6 % of subjects treated with CRESTOR versus 2 . 8 % of placebo - treated subjects discontinued due to adverse reactions .
The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation were : myalgia , hepatic enzyme increased , headache , and nausea [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 7 ) ] .
Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2 % of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 2 .
• Table 2 .
Adverse Reactions1 Reported in 2 % of Patients Treated with CRESTOR and > Placebo in the METEOR Trial ( % of Patients ) Adverse Reactions CRESTOR 40 mg N = 700 Placebo N = 281 Myalgia 12 . 7 12 . 1 Arthralgia 10 . 1 7 . 1 Headache 6 . 4 5 . 3 Dizziness 4 . 0 2 . 8 Increased CPK 2 . 6 0 . 7 Abdominal pain 2 . 4 1 . 8 [ 1 ] ALT > 3 x ULN 2 . 2 0 . 7 [ 1 ] Frequency recorded as abnormal laboratory value .
In the JUPITER study , 17 , 802 participants were treated with rosuvastatin 20 mg ( n = 8901 ) or placebo ( n = 8901 ) for a mean duration of 2 years .
A higher percentage of rosuvastatin - treated patients versus placebo - treated patients , 6 . 6 % and 6 . 2 % , respectively , discontinued study medication due to an adverse event , irrespective of treatment causality .
Myalgia was the most common adverse reaction that led to treatment discontinuation .
In JUPITER , there was a significantly higher frequency of diabetes mellitus reported in patients taking rosuvastatin ( 2 . 8 % ) versus patients taking placebo ( 2 . 3 % ) .
Mean HbA1c was significantly increased by 0 . 1 % in rosuvastatin - treated patients compared to placebo - treated patients .
The number of patients with a HbA1c > 6 . 5 % at the end of the trial was significantly higher in rosuvastatin - treated versus placebo - treated patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 8 ) ] .
Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2 % of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 3 .
• Table 3 .
Adverse Reactions1 Reported in ≥ 2 % of Patients Treated with CRESTOR and > Placebo in the JUPITER Trial ( % of Patients ) Adverse Reactions CRESTOR 20 mg N = 8901 Placebo N = 8901 Myalgia 7 . 6 6 . 6 Arthralgia 3 . 8 3 . 2 Constipation 3 . 3 3 . 0 Diabetes mellitus 2 . 8 2 . 3 Nausea 2 . 4 2 . 3 6 . 2 Pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age In a 12 - week controlled study in boys and postmenarchal girls , the safety and tolerability profile of CRESTOR 5 to 20 mg daily was generally similar to that of placebo [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 6 ) and Use in Specific Populations , Pediatric Use ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
However , elevations in serum creatine phosphokinase ( CK ) > 10 x ULN were observed more frequently in rosuvastatin compared with placebo - treated children .
Four of 130 ( 3 % ) children treated with rosuvastatin ( 2 treated with 10 mg and 2 treated with 20 mg ) had increased CK > 10 x ULN , compared to 0 of 46 children on placebo .
6 . 3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of CRESTOR : arthralgia , fatal and non - fatal hepatic failure , hepatitis , jaundice , thrombocytopenia , depression , sleep disorders ( including insomnia and nightmares ) and gynecomastia .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
There have been rare reports of immune - mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use [ seeWarnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment ( e . g . , memory loss , forgetfulness , amnesia , memory impairment , confusion ) associated with statin use .
These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins .
The reports are generally nonserious , and reversible upon statin discontinuation , with variable times to symptom onset ( 1 day to years ) and symptom resolution ( median of 3 weeks ) .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • • Cyclosporine : Combination increases rosuvastatin exposure .
Limit CRESTOR dose to 5 mg once daily .
( 2 . 5 , 5 . 1 , 7 . 1 , 12 . 3 ) • • Gemfibrozil : Combination should be avoided .
If used together , limit CRESTOR dose to 10 mg once daily .
( 5 . 1 , 7 . 2 ) • • Lopinavir / Ritonavir or atazanavir / ritonavir : Combination increases rosuvastatin exposure .
Limit CRESTOR dose to 10 mg once daily .
( 2 . 5 , 5 . 1 , 7 . 3 , 12 . 3 ) • • Coumarin anticoagulants : Combination prolongs INR .
Achieve stable INR prior to starting CRESTOR .
Monitor INR frequently until stable upon initiation or alteration of CRESTOR therapy .
( 5 . 3 , 7 . 4 ) • • Concomitant lipid - lowering therapies : Use with fibrates or lipid - modifying doses ( ≥ 1 g / day ) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects .
Caution should be used when prescribing with CRESTOR .
( 5 . 1 , 7 . 5 , 7 . 6 ) 7 . 1 Cyclosporine Cyclosporine increased rosuvastatin exposure ( AUC ) 7 ‑ fold .
Therefore , in patients taking cyclosporine , the dose of CRESTOR should not exceed 5 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2 Gemfibrozil Gemfibrozil significantly increased rosuvastatin exposure .
Due to an observed increased risk of myopathy / rhabdomyolysis , combination therapy with CRESTOR and gemfibrozil should be avoided .
If used together , the dose of CRESTOR should not exceed 10 mg once daily [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 3 Protease Inhibitors Coadministration of rosuvastatin with certain protease inhibitors given in combination with ritonavir has differing effects on rosuvastatin exposure .
The protease inhibitor combinations lopinavir / ritonavir and atazanavir / ritonavir increase rosuvastatin exposure ( AUC ) up to threefold [ see Table 4 – Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
For these combinations the dose of CRESTOR should not exceed 10 mg once daily .
The combinations of tipranavir / ritonavir or fosamprenavir / ritonavir produce little or no change in rosuvastatin exposure .
Caution should be exercised when rosuvastatin is coadministered with protease inhibitors given in combination with ritonavir [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) andClinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 4 Coumarin Anticoagulants CRESTOR significantly increased INR in patients receiving coumarin anticoagulants .
Therefore , caution should be exercised when coumarin anticoagulants are given in conjunction with CRESTOR .
In patients taking coumarin anticoagulants and CRESTOR concomitantly , INR should be determined before starting CRESTOR and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significant alteration of INR occurs [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 5 Niacin The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when CRESTOR is used in combination with lipid - modifying doses ( ≥ 1 g / day ) of niacin ; caution should be used when prescribing with CRESTOR [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
7 . 6 Fenofibrate When CRESTOR was coadministered with fenofibrate , no clinically significant increase in the AUC of rosuvastatin or fenofibrate was observed .
Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG - CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concomitant use of fenofibrates , caution should be used when prescribing fenofibrates with CRESTOR [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) andClinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 7 Colchicine Cases of myopathy , including rhabdomyolysis , have been reported with HMG ‑ CoA reductase inhibitors , including rosuvastatin , coadministered with colchicine , and caution should be exercised when prescribing CRESTOR with colchicine [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • • Severe renal impairment ( not on hemodialysis ) : Starting dose is 5 mg , not to exceed 10 mg .
( 2 . 6 , 5 . 1 , 8 . 6 ) • • Asian population : Consider 5 mg starting dose .
( 2 . 4 , 8 . 8 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic effects : Pregnancy Category X . CRESTOR is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant .
Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy , and cholesterol products are essential for fetal development .
Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and discontinuation of lipid - lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on long - term outcomes of primary hyperlipidemia therapy [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
There are no adequate and well - controlled studies of CRESTOR in pregnant women .
There have been rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to HMG ‑ CoA reductase inhibitors .
In a review of about 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to other HMG ‑ CoA reductase inhibitors , the incidences of congenital anomalies , spontaneous abortions , and fetal deaths / stillbirths did not exceed the rate expected in the general population .
However , this study was only able to exclude a three - to - fourfold increased risk of congenital anomalies over background incidence .
In 89 % of these cases , drug treatment started before pregnancy and stopped during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified .
Rosuvastatin crosses the placenta in rats and rabbits .
In rats , CRESTOR was not teratogenic at systemic exposures equivalent to a human therapeutic dose of 40 mg / day .
At 10 ‑ 12 times the human dose of 40 mg / day , there was decreased pup survival , decreased fetal body weight among female pups , and delayed ossification .
In rabbits , pup viability decreased and maternal mortality increased at doses equivalent to the human dose of 40 mg / day [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 2 ) ] .
CRESTOR may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
If the patient becomes pregnant while taking CRESTOR , the patient should be apprised of the potential risks to the fetus and the lack of known clinical benefit with continued use during pregnancy .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether rosuvastatin is excreted in human milk , but a small amount of another drug in this class does pass into breast milk .
In rats , breast milk concentrations of rosuvastatin are three times higher than plasma levels ; however , animal breast milk drug levels may not accurately reflect human breast milk levels .
Because another drug in this class passes into human milk and because HMG ‑ CoA reductase inhibitors have a potential to cause serious adverse reactions in nursing infants , women who require CRESTOR treatment should be advised not to nurse their infants [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of CRESTOR in patients 10 to 17 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia were evaluated in a controlled clinical trial of 12 weeks duration followed by 40 weeks of open - label exposure .
Patients treated with 5 mg , 10 mg , and 20 mg daily CRESTOR had an adverse experience profile generally similar to that of patients treated with placebo [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Although not all adverse reactions identified in the adult population have been observed in clinical trials of children and adolescent patients , the same warnings and precautions for adults should be considered for children and adolescents .
There was no detectable effect of CRESTOR on growth , weight , BMI ( body mass index ) , or sexual maturation [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 ) ] in pediatric patients ( 10 to 17 years of age ) .
Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on CRESTOR therapy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
CRESTOR has not been studied in controlled clinical trials involving prepubertal patients or patients younger than 10 years of age .
Doses of CRESTOR greater than 20 mg have not been studied in the pediatric population .
In children and adolescents with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia experience is limited to eight patients ( aged 8 years and above ) .
In a pharmacokinetic study , 18 patients ( 9 boys and 9 girls ) 10 to 17 years of age with heterozygous FH received single and multiple oral doses of CRESTOR .
Both Cmax and AUC of rosuvastatin were similar to values observed in adult subjects administered the same doses .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 10 , 275 patients in clinical studies with CRESTOR , 3159 ( 31 % ) were 65 years and older , and 698 ( 6 . 8 % ) were 75 years and older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects , and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
Elderly patients are at higher risk of myopathy and CRESTOR should be prescribed with caution in the elderly [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment Rosuvastatin exposure is not influenced by mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr ≥ 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) ; however , exposure to rosuvastatin is increased to a clinically significant extent in patients with severe renal impairment who are not receiving hemodialysis .
CRESTOR dosing should be adjusted in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) not requiring hemodialysis [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment CRESTOR is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease , which may include unexplained persistent elevations of hepatic transaminase levels .
Chronic alcohol liver disease is known to increase rosuvastatin exposure ; CRESTOR should be used with caution in these patients [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) , Warning and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) , andClinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 8 Asian Patients Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated an approximate 2 ‑ fold increase in median exposure to rosuvastatin in Asian subjects when compared with Caucasian controls .
CRESTOR dosage should be adjusted in Asian patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no specific treatment in the event of overdose .
In the event of overdose , the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted as required .
Hemodialysis does not significantly enhance clearance of rosuvastatin .
11 DESCRIPTION CRESTOR ( rosuvastatin calcium ) is a synthetic lipid - lowering agent for oral administration .
The chemical name for rosuvastatin calcium is bis [ ( E ) - 7 - [ 4 - ( 4 - fluorophenyl ) - 6 - isopropyl - 2 - [ methyl ( methylsulfonyl ) amino ] pyrimidin - 5 - yl ] ( 3 R , 5 S ) - 3 , 5 - dihydroxyhept - 6 - enoic acid ] calcium salt with the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] The empirical formula for rosuvastatin calcium is ( C22H27FN3O6S ) 2 Ca and the molecular weight is 1001 . 14 .
Rosuvastatin calcium is a white amorphous powder that is sparingly soluble in water and methanol , and slightly soluble in ethanol .
Rosuvastatin calcium is a hydrophilic compound with a partition coefficient ( octanol / water ) of 0 . 13 at pH of 7 . 0 .
CRESTOR Tablets for oral administration contain 5 , 10 , 20 , or 40 mg of rosuvastatin and the following inactive ingredients : Each tablet contains : microcrystalline cellulose NF , lactose monohydrate NF , tribasic calcium phosphate NF , crospovidone NF , magnesium stearate NF , hypromellose NF , triacetin NF , titanium dioxide USP , yellow ferric oxide , and red ferric oxide NF .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action CRESTOR is a selective and competitive inhibitor of HMG - CoA reductase , the rate - limiting enzyme that converts 3 ‑ hydroxy ‑ 3 ‑ methylglutaryl coenzyme A to mevalonate , a precursor of cholesterol .
In vivo studies in animals , and in vitro studies in cultured animal and human cells have shown rosuvastatin to have a high uptake into , and selectivity for , action in the liver , the target organ for cholesterol lowering .
In in vivo and in vitro studies , rosuvastatin produces its lipid - modifying effects in two ways .
First , it increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell - surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL .
Second , rosuvastatin inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL , which reduces the total number of VLDL and LDL particles .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics • • Absorption : In clinical pharmacology studies in man , peak plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were reached 3 to 5 hours following oral dosing .
Both Cmax and AUC increased in approximate proportion to CRESTOR dose .
The absolute bioavailability of rosuvastatin is approximately 20 % .
• Administration of CRESTOR with food did not affect the AUC of rosuvastatin .
• The AUC of rosuvastatin does not differ following evening or morning drug administration .
• • Distribution : Mean volume of distribution at steady - state of rosuvastatin is approximately 134 liters .
Rosuvastatin is 88 % bound to plasma proteins , mostly albumin .
This binding is reversible and independent of plasma concentrations .
• • Metabolism : Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolized ; approximately 10 % of a radiolabeled dose is recovered as metabolite .
The major metabolite is N - desmethyl rosuvastatin , which is formed principally by cytochrome P450 \ 2C9 , and in vitro studies have demonstrated that N - desmethyl rosuvastatin has approximately one - sixth to one - half the HMG ‑ CoA reductase inhibitory activity of the parent compound .
Overall , greater than 90 % of active plasma HMG ‑ CoA reductase inhibitory activity is accounted for by the parent compound .
• • Excretion : Following oral administration , rosuvastatin and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the feces ( 90 % ) .
The elimination half - life ( t1 / 2 ) of rosuvastatin is approximately 19 hours .
• After an intravenous dose , approximately 28 % of total body clearance was via the renal route , and 72 % by the hepatic route .
• • Race : A population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics among Caucasian , Hispanic , and Black or Afro - Caribbean groups .
However , pharmacokinetic studies , including one conducted in the US , have demonstrated an approximate 2 ‑ fold elevation in median exposure ( AUC and Cmax ) in Asian subjects when compared with a Caucasian control group .
• • Gender : There were no differences in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin between men and women .
• • Geriatric : There were no differences in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin between the nonelderly and elderly populations ( age ≥ 65 years ) .
• • Renal Impairment : Mild to moderate renal impairment ( CLcr ≥ 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) had no influence on plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin .
However , plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin increased to a clinically significant extent ( about 3 ‑ fold ) in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) not receiving hemodialysis compared with healthy subjects ( CLcr > 80 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) .
• • Hemodialysis : Steady - state plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin in patients on chronic hemodialysis were approximately 50 % greater compared with healthy volunteer subjects with normal renal function .
• • Hepatic Impairment : In patients with chronic alcohol liver disease , plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were modestly increased .
• In patients with Child ‑ Pugh A disease , Cmax and AUC were increased by 60 % and 5 % , respectively , as compared with patients with normal liver function .
In patients with Child ‑ Pugh B disease , Cmax and AUC were increased 100 % and 21 % , respectively , compared with patients with normal liver function .
Drug - Drug Interactions : Rosuvastatin clearance is not dependent on metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4 to a clinically significant extent .
Rosuvastatin is a substrate for certain transporter proteins including the hepatic uptake transporter organic anion - transporting polyprotein 1B1 ( OATP1B1 ) and efflux transporter breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) .
Concomitant administration of CRESTOR with medications that are inhibitors of these transporter proteins ( e . g . cyclosporine , certain HIV protease inhibitors ) may result in increased rosuvastatin plasma concentrations and an increased risk of myopathy [ seeDosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) ] .

Increased incidence of polyps was not seen at lower doses .
In a 107 - week carcinogenicity study in mice given 10 , 60 , 200 mg / kg / day by oral gavage , an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenoma / carcinoma was observed at 200 mg / kg / day at systemic exposures 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC .
An increased incidence of hepatocellular tumors was not seen at lower doses .
Rosuvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli , the mouse lymphoma assay , and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells .
Rosuvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test .
In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 5 , 15 , 50 mg / kg / day , males were treated for 9 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating and throughout mating until gestation day 7 .
No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 50 mg / kg / day ( systemic exposures up to 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC ) .
In testicles of dogs treated with rosuvastatin at 30 mg / kg / day for one month , spermatidic giant cells were seen .
Spermatidic giant cells were observed in monkeys after 6 ‑ month treatment at 30 mg / kg / day in addition to vacuolation of seminiferous tubular epithelium .
Exposures in the dog were 20 times and in the monkey 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on body surface area .
Similar findings have been seen with other drugs in this class .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Embryo - fetal Development Rosuvastatin crosses the placenta and is found in fetal tissue and amniotic fluid at 3 % and 20 % , respectively , of the maternal plasma concentration following a single 25 mg / kg oral gavage dose on gestation day 16 in rats .
A higher fetal tissue distribution ( 25 % maternal plasma concentration ) was observed in rabbits after a single oral gavage dose of 1 mg / kg on gestation day 18 .
In female rats given oral gavage doses of 5 , 15 , 50 mg / kg / day rosuvastatin before mating and continuing through day 7 postcoitus results in decreased fetal body weight ( female pups ) and delayed ossification at the high dose ( systemic exposures 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC ) .
In pregnant rats given oral gavage doses of 2 , 10 , 50 mg / kg / day from gestation day 7 through lactation day 21 ( weaning ) , decreased pup survival occurred in groups given 50 mg / kg / day , systemic exposures ≥ 12 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on body surface area .
In pregnant rabbits given oral gavage doses of 0 . 3 , 1 , 3 mg / kg / day from gestation day 6 to lactation day 18 ( weaning ) , exposures equivalent to the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on body surface area , decreased fetal viability and maternal mortality was observed .
Rosuvastatin was not teratogenic in rats at ≤ 25 mg / kg / day or in rabbits ≤ 3 mg / kg / day ( systemic exposures equivalent to the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC or body surface area , respectively ) .
Central Nervous System Toxicity CNS vascular lesions , characterized by perivascular hemorrhages , edema , and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces , have been observed in dogs treated with several other members of this drug class .
A chemically similar drug in this class produced dose - dependent optic nerve degeneration ( Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers ) in dogs , at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose .
Edema , hemorrhage , and partial necrosis in the interstitium of the choroid plexus was observed in a female dog sacrificed moribund at day 24 at 90 mg / kg / day by oral gavage ( systemic exposures 100 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC ) .
Corneal opacity was seen in dogs treated for 52 weeks at 6 mg / kg / day by oral gavage ( systemic exposures 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC ) .
Cataracts were seen in dogs treated for 12 weeks by oral gavage at 30 mg / kg / day ( systemic exposures 60 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC ) .
Retinal dysplasia and retinal loss were seen in dogs treated for 4 weeks by oral gavage at 90 mg / kg / day ( systemic exposures 100 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC ) .
Doses ≤ 30 mg / kg / day ( systemic exposures ≤ 60 times the human exposure at 40 mg / day based on AUC ) did not reveal retinal findings during treatment for up to one year .

In the overall population , the mean LDL ‑ C reduction from baseline was 22 % .
About one - third of the patients benefited from increasing their dose from 20 mg to 40 mg with further LDL lowering of greater than 6 % .
In the 27 patients with at least a 15 % reduction in LDL ‑ C , the mean LDL - C reduction was 30 % ( median 28 % reduction ) .
Among 13 patients with an LDL ‑ C reduction of < 15 % , 3 had no change or an increase in LDL ‑ C .
Reductions in LDL ‑ C of 15 % or greater were observed in 3 of 5 patients with known receptor negative status .
14 . 6 Pediatric Patients with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia In a double blind , randomized , multicenter , placebo - controlled , 12 week study , 176 ( 97 male and 79 female ) children and adolescents with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia were randomized to rosuvastatin 5 , 10 or 20 mg or placebo daily .
Patients ranged in age from 10 to 17 years ( median age of 14 years ) with approximately 30 % of the patients 10 to 13 years and approximately 17 % , 18 % , 40 % , and 25 % at Tanner stages II , III , IV , and V , respectively .
Females were at least 1 year postmenarche .
Mean LDL C at baseline was 233 mg / dL ( range of 129 to 399 ) .
The 12 week double blind phase was followed by a 40 week open label dose - titration phase , where all patients ( n = 173 ) received 5 mg , 10 mg or 20 mg rosuvastatin daily .
Rosuvastatin significantly reduced LDL - C ( primary end point ) , total cholesterol and ApoB levels at each dose compared to placebo .
Results are shown in Table 11 below .

For the 40 week , open label phase , 71 % of the patients were titrated to the maximum dose of 20 mg and 41 % of the patients achieved the LDL C goal of 110 mg / dL .
The long - term efficacy of rosuvastatin therapy initiated in childhood to reduce morbidity and mortality in adulthood has not been established .
14 . 7 Slowing of the Progression of Atherosclerosis In the Measuring Effects on Intima Media Thickness : an Evaluation Of Rosuvastatin 40 mg ( METEOR ) study , the effect of therapy with CRESTOR on carotid atherosclerosis was assessed by B - mode ultrasonography in patients with elevated LDL ‑ C , at low risk ( Framingham risk < 10 % over ten years ) for symptomatic coronary artery disease and with subclinical atherosclerosis as evidenced by carotid intimal - medial thickness ( cIMT ) .
In this double - blind , placebo - controlled clinical study 984 patients were randomized ( of whom 876 were analyzed ) in a 5 : 2 ratio to CRESTOR 40 mg or placebo once daily .
Ultrasonograms of the carotid walls were used to determine the annualized rate of change per patient from baseline to two years in mean maximum cIMT of 12 measured segments .
The estimated difference in the rate of change in the maximum cIMT analyzed over all 12 carotid artery sites between patients treated with CRESTOR and placebo - treated patients was - 0 . 0145 mm / year ( 95 % CI – 0 . 0196 , – 0 . 0093 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .
The annualized rate of change from baseline for the placebo group was + 0 . 0131 mm / year ( p < 0 . 0001 ) .
The annualized rate of change from baseline for the group treated with CRESTOR was - 0 . 0014 mm / year ( p = 0 . 32 ) .
At an individual patient level in the group treated with CRESTOR , 52 . 1 % of patients demonstrated an absence of disease progression ( defined as a negative annualized rate of change ) , compared to 37 . 7 % of patients in the placebo group .
14 . 8 Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease In the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention : An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin ( JUPITER ) study , the effect of CRESTOR ( rosuvastatin calcium ) on the occurrence of major cardiovascular ( CV ) disease events was assessed in 17 , 802 men ( ≥ 50 years ) and women ( ≥ 60 years ) who had no clinically evident cardiovascular disease , LDL ‑ C levels < 130 mg / dL ( 3 . 3 mmol / l ) and hs ‑ CRP levels ≥ 2 mg / L .
The study population had an estimated baseline coronary heart disease risk of 11 . 6 % over 10 years based on the Framingham risk criteria and included a high percentage of patients with additional risk factors such as hypertension ( 58 % ) , low HDL ‑ C levels ( 23 % ) , cigarette smoking ( 16 % ) , or a family history of premature CHD ( 12 % ) .
Study participants had a median baseline LDL ‑ C of 108 mg / dL and hsCRP of 4 . 3 mg / L .
Study participants were randomly assigned to placebo ( n = 8901 ) or rosuvastatin 20 mg once daily ( n = 8901 ) and were followed for a mean duration of 2 years .
The JUPITER study was stopped early by the Data Safety Monitoring Board due to meeting predefined stopping rules for efficacy in rosuvastatin - treated subjects .
The primary end point was a composite end point consisting of the time - to - first occurrence of any of the following major CV events : CV death , nonfatal myocardial infarction , nonfatal stroke , hospitalization for unstable angina or an arterial revascularization procedure .
Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of major CV events ( 252 events in the placebo group vs . 142 events in the rosuvastatin group ) with a statistically significant ( p < 0 . 001 ) relative risk reduction of 44 % and absolute risk reduction of 1 . 2 % ( see Figure 2 ) .
The risk reduction for the primary end point was consistent across the following predefined subgroups : age , sex , race , smoking status , family history of premature CHD , body mass index , LDL ‑ C , HDL ‑ C , and hsCRP levels .
Figure 2 .
Time to first occurrence of major cardiovascular events in JUPITER [ MULTIMEDIA ] The individual components of the primary end point are presented in Figure 3 .
Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction , nonfatal stroke , and arterial revascularization procedures .
There were no significant treatment differences between the rosuvastatin and placebo groups for death due to cardiovascular causes or hospitalizations for unstable angina .
Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction ( 6 fatal events and 62 nonfatal events in placebo - treated subjects vs . 9 fatal events and 22 nonfatal events in rosuvastatin - treated subjects ) and the risk of stroke ( 6 fatal events and 58 nonfatal events in placebo - treated subjects vs . 3 fatal events and 30 nonfatal events in rosuvastatin - treated subjects ) .
In a post - hoc subgroup analysis of JUPITER subjects ( n = 1405 ; rosuvastatin = 725 , placebo = 680 ) with a hsCRP ≥ 2 mg / L and no other traditional risk factors ( smoking , BP ≥ 140 / 90 or taking antihypertensives , low HDL ‑ C ) other than age , after adjustment for high HDL ‑ C , there was no significant treatment benefit with rosuvastatin treatment .

What is CRESTOR ?
CRESTOR is a prescription medicine that belongs to a group of cholesterol - lowering medicines called statins .
Along with diet , CRESTOR lowers “ bad ” cholesterol ( LDL ‑ C ) , increases “ good ” cholesterol ( HDL ‑ C ) .
If bad cholesterol levels are left untreated , fatty deposits ( plaque ) can build up in the walls of the blood vessels .
This plaque buildup over time , can lead to narrowing of these vessels .
This is one of the most common causes of heart disease .
By lowering bad cholesterol in your blood , CRESTOR can slow this plaque buildup in the walls of blood vessels .
CRESTOR has been proven to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in older adults without known heart disease .
What is Cholesterol ?
Cholesterol is a fatty substance , also called a lipid , normally found in your bloodstream .
Your body needs a certain amount of cholesterol to function properly .
But high cholesterol can lead to health problems .
LDL - C is called bad cholesterol because if you have too much in your bloodstream , it can become a danger to your health and can lead to potentially serious conditions .
HDL ‑ C is known as good cholesterol because it may help remove excess cholesterol .
Common health factors such as diabetes , high blood pressure , smoking , obesity , family history of early heart disease , and age can make controlling your cholesterol even more important .
What is Atherosclerosis ?
Atherosclerosis is the progressive buildup of plaque in the arteries over time .
One major cause is high levels of LDL ‑ C .
Other health factors , such as family history , diabetes , high blood pressure , or if you smoke , or are overweight , may also play a role in the formation of plaque in arteries .
Often this plaque starts building up in arteries in early adulthood and gets worse over time .
How Does CRESTOR Work ?
