• Hypertension : Monitor blood pressure and treat ( 5 . 4 ) .
• Cytopenias : Check complete blood counts monthly ( 5 . 5 ) .
• Second Primary Malignancies : Other malignancies have occurred in patients , including skin cancers , and other carcinomas ( 5 . 6 ) .
• Tumor Lysis Syndrome ( TLS ) : Assess baseline risk and take precautions .
Monitor and treat for TLS ( 5 . 7 ) .
• Embryo - Fetal Toxicity : Can cause fetal harm .
Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception ( 5 . 8 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) .
5 . 1 Hemorrhage Fatal bleeding events have occurred in patients who received IMBRUVICA .
Major hemorrhage ( ≥ Grade 3 , serious , or any central nervous system events ; e . g . , intracranial hemorrhage [ including subdural hematoma ] , gastrointestinal bleeding , hematuria , and post procedural hemorrhage ) occurred in 4 . 2 % of patients , with fatalities occurring in 0 . 4 % of 2 , 838 patients who received IMBRUVICA in 27 clinical trials .
Bleeding events of any grade including bruising and petechiae occurred in 39 % , and excluding bruising and petechiae occurred in 23 % of patients who received IMBRUVICA , respectively [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood .
Use of either anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents concomitantly with IMBRUVICA increases the risk of major hemorrhage .
Across clinical trials , 3 . 1 % of 2 , 838 patients who received IMBRUVICA without antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy experienced major hemorrhage .
The addition of antiplatelet therapy with or without anticoagulant therapy increased this percentage to 4 . 4 % , and the addition of anticoagulant therapy with or without antiplatelet therapy increased this percentage to 6 . 1 % .
Consider the risks and benefits of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy when co - administered with IMBRUVICA .
Monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding .
Consider the benefit - risk of withholding IMBRUVICA for at least 3 to 7 days pre - and post - surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding [ seeClinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
5 . 2 Infections Fatal and non - fatal infections ( including bacterial , viral , or fungal ) have occurred with IMBRUVICA therapy .
Grade 3 or greater infections occurred in 21 % of 1 , 476 patients who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 , 6 . 2 ) ] .
Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia ( PJP ) have occurred in patients treated with IMBRUVICA .
Consider prophylaxis according to standard of care in patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections .
Monitor and evaluate patients for fever and infections and treat appropriately .
5 . 3 Cardiac Arrhythmias , Cardiac Failure , and Sudden Death Fatal and serious cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure have occurred with IMBRUVICA .
Deaths due to cardiac causes or sudden deaths occurred in 1 % of 4 , 896 patients who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials , including in patients who received IMBRUVICA in unapproved monotherapy or combination regimens .
These adverse reactions occurred in patients with and without preexisting hypertension or cardiac comorbidities .
Patients with cardiac comorbidities may be at greater risk of these events .
Grade 3 or greater ventricular tachyarrhythmias were reported in 0 . 2 % , Grade 3 or greater atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter were reported in 3 . 7 % , and Grade 3 or greater cardiac failure was reported in 1 . 3 % of 4 , 896 patients who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials , including in patients who received IMBRUVICA in unapproved monotherapy or combination regimens .
These events have occurred particularly in patients with cardiac risk factors including hypertension and diabetes mellitus , a previous history of cardiac arrhythmias , and in patients with acute infections [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Evaluate cardiac history and function at baseline , and monitor patients for cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac function .
Obtain further evaluation ( e . g . , ECG , echocardiogram ) as indicated for patients who develop symptoms of arrhythmia ( e . g . , palpitations , lightheadedness , syncope , chest pain ) , new onset dyspnea , or other cardiovascular concerns .
Manage cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac failure appropriately , follow dose modification guidelines [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] , and consider the risks and benefits of continued IMBRUVICA treatment .
5 . 4 Hypertension Hypertension occurred in 19 % of 1 , 476 patients who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials .
Grade 3 or greater hypertension occurred in 8 % of patients [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Based on data from 1 , 124 of these patients , the median time to onset was 5 . 9 months ( range , 0 . 03 to 24 months ) .
Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with IMBRUVICA , initiate or adjust anti - hypertensive medication throughout treatment with IMBRUVICA as appropriate , and follow dosage modification guidelines for Grade 3 or higher hypertension [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 5 Cytopenias In 645 patients with B - cell malignancies who received IMBRUVICA as a single agent , grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 23 % of patients , grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia in 8 % and grade 3 or 4 anemia in 2 . 8 % , based on laboratory measurements [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Monitor complete blood counts monthly .
5 . 6 Second Primary Malignancies Other malignancies ( 10 % ) , including non - skin carcinomas ( 3 . 9 % ) , occurred among the 1 , 476 patients who received IMBRUVICA in clinical trials [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
The most frequent second primary malignancy was non - melanoma skin cancer ( 6 % ) .
5 . 7 Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome has been infrequently reported with IMBRUVICA [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Assess the baseline risk ( e . g . , high tumor burden ) and take appropriate precautions .
Monitor patients closely and treat as appropriate .
5 . 8 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on findings in animals , IMBRUVICA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
Administration of ibrutinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis caused embryo - fetal toxicity including malformations at exposures that were 2 - 20 times higher than those reported in patients with hematologic malignancies .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IMBRUVICA and for 1 month after the last dose .
[ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .

Visual Disturbance In randomized controlled trials ( n = 2 , 115 ; median treatment duration of 19 . 1 months for 1 , 157 patients treated with IMBRUVICA and 5 . 3 months for 958 patients in the control arm ) , blurred vision and decreased visual acuity of any grade occurred in 11 % of patients treated with IMBRUVICA ( 9 % Grade 1 , 2 % Grade 2 , no Grade 3 or higher ) compared to 6 % in the control arm ( 5 % Grade 1 and < 1 % Grade 2 and 3 ) .
Based on data from 1 , 605 of these patients , the median time to first onset was 91 days ( range , 0 to 617 ) versus 100 days ( range , 2 to 477 ) in IMBRUVICA - treated patients compared to the control arm , respectively .
Of the patients who reported visual disturbances , 60 % versus 71 % had complete resolution and 40 % versus 29 % had not reported resolution at the time of analysis in IMBRUVICA - treated patients compared to the control arm , respectively .
The median time from onset to resolution was 37 days ( range , 1 to 457 ) versus 26 days ( range , 1 to 721 ) in IMBRUVICA - treated subjects compared to the control arm , respectively .
Long - Term Safety The safety data from long - term treatment with IMBRUVICA over 5 years of 1 , 284 patients ( treatment - naïve CLL / SLL n = 162 , relapsed / refractory CLL / SLL n = 646 , relapsed / refractory MCL n = 370 , and WM n = 106 ) were analyzed .
The median treatment duration was 51 months ( range , 0 . 2 to 98 months ) for CLL / SLL , 11 months ( range , 0 to 87 months ) for MCL , and 47 months ( range , 0 . 3 to 61 months ) for WM . The cumulative rate of hypertension increased over time .
The prevalence for Grade 3 or greater hypertension was 4 % ( year 0 - 1 ) , 7 % ( year 1 - 2 ) , 9 % ( year 2 - 3 ) , 9 % ( year 3 - 4 ) , and 9 % ( year 4 - 5 ) ; the overall incidence for the 5 - year period was 11 % .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of IMBRUVICA .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
• Hepatobiliary disorders : hepatic failure including acute and / or fatal events , hepatic cirrhosis • Respiratory disorders : interstitial lung disease • Metabolic and nutrition disorders : tumor lysis syndrome • Immune system disorders : anaphylactic shock , angioedema , urticaria • Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Stevens - Johnson Syndrome ( SJS ) , onychoclasis , panniculitis , neutrophilic dermatoses • Infections : hepatitis B reactivation • Nervous system disorders : peripheral neuropathy 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • CYP3A Inhibitors : Modify IMBRUVICA dose as described ( 2 . 3 , 7 . 1 ) .
• CYP3A Inducers : Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A inducers ( 7 . 2 ) .
7 . 1 Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors on Ibrutinib The coadministration of IMBRUVICA with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor may increase ibrutinib plasma concentrations [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Increased ibrutinib concentrations may increase the risk of drug - related toxicity .
Dose modifications of IMBRUVICA are recommended when used concomitantly with posaconazole , voriconazole and moderate CYP3A inhibitors [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Avoid concomitant use of other strong CYP3A inhibitors .
Interrupt IMBRUVICA if these inhibitors will be used short - term ( such as anti - infectives for seven days or less ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
Avoid grapefruit and Seville oranges during IMBRUVICA treatment , as these contain strong or moderate inhibitors of CYP3A .
7 . 2 Effect of CYP3A Inducers on Ibrutinib The coadministration of IMBRUVICA with strong CYP3A inducers may decrease ibrutinib concentrations .
Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A inducers [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) • Hepatic Impairment : Avoid use of IMBRUVICA in patients with severe hepatic impairment .
In patients with mild or moderate impairment , reduce IMBRUVICA dose ( 2 . 4 , 8 . 6 ) .
8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary IMBRUVICA can cause fetal harm based on findings from animal studies .
There are no available data on IMBRUVICA use in pregnant women to inform a drug - associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of ibrutinib to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis at exposures up to 2 - 20 times the clinical doses of 420 - 560 mg daily produced embryofetal toxicity including structural abnormalities ( see Data ) .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data Ibrutinib was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 10 , 40 and 80 mg / kg / day .
Ibrutinib at a dose of 80 mg / kg / day was associated with visceral malformations ( heart and major vessels ) and increased resorptions and post - implantation loss .
The dose of 80 mg / kg / day in rats is approximately 14 times the exposure ( AUC ) in patients with MCL or MZL and 20 times the exposure in patients with CLL / SLL or WM administered the dose of 560 mg daily and 420 mg daily , respectively .
Ibrutinib at doses of 40 mg / kg / day or greater was associated with decreased fetal weights .
The dose of 40 mg / kg / day in rats is approximately 6 times the exposure ( AUC ) in patients with MCL administered the dose of 560 mg daily .
Ibrutinib was also administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses of 5 , 15 , and 45 mg / kg / day .
Ibrutinib at a dose of 15 mg / kg / day or greater was associated with skeletal variations ( fused sternebrae ) and ibrutinib at a dose of 45 mg / kg / day was associated with increased resorptions and post - implantation loss .
The dose of 15 mg / kg / day in rabbits is approximately 2 . 0 times the exposure ( AUC ) in patients with MCL and 2 . 8 times the exposure in patients with CLL / SLL or WM administered the dose of 560 and 420 mg daily , respectively .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of ibrutinib or its metabolites in human milk , the effects on the breastfed child , or the effects on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child , advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with IMBRUVICA and for 1 week after the last dose .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential IMBRUVICA can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating IMBRUVICA .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IMBRUVICA and for 1 month after the last dose .
Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IMBRUVICA and for 1 month following the last dose .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Chronic GVHD The safety and effectiveness of IMBRUVICA have been established for treatment of cGVHD after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy in pediatric patients 1 year of age and older .
Use of IMBRUVICA for this indication is supported by evidence from iMAGINE , a study which included pediatric patients age 1 year and older with previously treated cGVHD , including patients in the following age groups : one patient 1 year to less than 2 years of age , 20 patients 2 years to less than 12 years of age , and 19 patients 12 years to less than 17 years of age .
Additional supportive efficacy data was provided from Study 1129 in adults [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) , and Clinical Studies ( 14 . 5 ) ] .
The recommended dosage of IMBRUVICA in patients age 12 years and older is the same as that in adults , and the recommended dosage in patients age 1 year to less than 12 years old is based on body - surface area ( BSA ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of IMBRUVICA have not been established for this indication in pediatric patients less than 1 year of age .
Mature B - cell Non - Hodgkin Lymphoma The safety and effectiveness of IMBRUVICA in combination with chemoimmunotherapy were assessed but have not been established based on an open - label , randomized study ( NCT02703272 ) in 35 patients , which included 26 pediatric patients age 5 to less than 17 years , with previously treated mature B - cell non - Hodgkin lymphoma .
The study was stopped for futility .
In the randomized population , major hemorrhage and discontinuation of chemoimmunotherapy due to adverse reactions occurred more frequently in the ibrutinib plus chemoimmunotherapy arm compared to the chemoimmunotherapy alone arm .
MCL , CLL / SLL , CLL / SLL with 17 p deletion , WM , MZL The safety and effectiveness of IMBRUVICA in pediatric patients have not been established in MCL , CLL / SLL , CLL / SLL with 17 p deletion , WM , or MZL .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 1 , 124 patients in clinical studies of IMBRUVICA for MCL , CLL / SLL , CLL / SLL with 17 p deletion , WM , MZL , and cGVHD , 64 % were ≥ 65 years of age , while 23 % were ≥ 75 years of age [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 . 1 , 14 . 2 , 14 . 3 , 14 . 4 , 14 . 5 ) ] .
No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between younger and older patients .
Anemia ( all grades ) , pneumonia ( Grade 3 or higher ) , thrombocytopenia , hypertension , and atrial fibrillation occurred more frequently among older patients treated with IMBRUVICA [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment Adult Patients with B - cell Malignancies Avoid use of IMBRUVICA in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class C ) .
The safety of IMBRUVICA has not been evaluated in patients with mild to severe hepatic impairment by Child - Pugh criteria .
Reduce the recommended dose when administering IMBRUVICA to patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class A and B ) .
Monitor patients more frequently for adverse reactions of IMBRUVICA [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Patients with cGVHD Avoid use of IMBRUVICA in patients with total bilirubin level > 3 x ULN ( unless of non - hepatic origin or due to Gilbert ’ s syndrome ) .
Reduce recommended dose when administering IMBRUVICA to patients with total bilirubin level > 1 . 5 to 3 x ULN ( unless of non - hepatic origin or due to Gilbert ’ s syndrome ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 4 ) ] .
8 . 7 Plasmapheresis Management of hyperviscosity in WM patients may include plasmapheresis before and during treatment with IMBRUVICA .
Modifications to IMBRUVICA dosing are not required .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no specific experience in the management of ibrutinib overdose in patients .
One healthy subject experienced reversible Grade 4 hepatic enzyme increases ( AST and ALT ) after a dose of 1680 mg .
Closely monitor patients who ingest more than the recommended dosage and provide appropriate supportive treatment .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Ibrutinib is a small - molecule inhibitor of Bruton ’ s tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) .
Ibrutinib forms a covalent bond with a cysteine residue in the BTK active site , leading to inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity .
BTK is a signaling molecule of the B - cell antigen receptor ( BCR ) and cytokine receptor pathways .
BTK ’ s role in signaling through the B - cell surface receptors results in activation of pathways necessary for B - cell trafficking , chemotaxis , and adhesion .
Nonclinical studies show that ibrutinib inhibits malignant B - cell proliferation and survival in vivo as well as cell migration and substrate adhesion in vitro .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics In patients with recurrent B - cell lymphoma > 90 % occupancy of the BTK active site in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was observed up to 24 hours after ibrutinib doses of ≥ 2 . 5 mg / kg / day ( ≥ 175 mg / day for average weight of 70 kg ) .
In adult patients with cGVHD , 93 % occupancy of the BTK active site in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was observed at the ibrutinib recommended dose .
The mean BTK occupancy in pediatric patients ranged from 95 . 1 % to 99 . 6 % .
In vitro Platelet Aggregation Ibrutinib demonstrated inhibition of collagen - induced platelet aggregation , with IC50 values at 4 . 6 µM ( 2026 ng / mL ) , 0 . 8 µM ( 352 ng / mL ) , and 3 µM ( 1321 ng / mL ) in blood samples from healthy donors , donors taking warfarin , and donors with severe renal dysfunction , respectively .
Ibrutinib did not show meaningful inhibition of platelet aggregation for ADP , arachidonic acid , ristocetin , and TRAP - 6 .
Cardiac Electrophysiology At a single dose 3 times the maximum recommended dose ( 1680 mg ) , IMBRUVICA did not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Ibrutinib exposure increases with doses up to 840 mg ( 1 . 5 times the maximum approved recommended dosage ) in patients with B - cell malignancies .
The mean steady - state AUC ( % coefficient of variation ) observed in patients at 560 mg with MCL is 865 ( 69 % ) ng ● h / mL and with MZL is 978 ( 82 % ) ng ● h / mL , and in patients at 420 mg with CLL / SLL is 708 ( 71 % ) ng ● h / mL , with WM is 707 ( 72 % ) ng ● h / mL , and in adult patients with previously treated cGVHD is 1159 ( 50 % ) ng ● h / mL .
Steady - state concentrations of ibrutinib without CYP3A inhibitors were achieved with an accumulation ratio of 1 to 1 . 6 after 1 week of multiple daily doses of 420 mg or 560 mg .
Absorption Absolute bioavailability of ibrutinib in fasted condition was 2 . 9 % ( 90 % CI : 2 . 1 , 3 . 9 ) in healthy subjects .
Ibrutinib is absorbed after oral administration with a median Tmaxof 1 hour to 2 hours .
Effect of Food The administration of IMBRUVICA with a high - fat and high - calorie meal ( 800 calories to 1 , 000 calories with approximately 50 % of total caloric content of the meal from fat ) increased ibrutinib Cmax by 2 - to 4 - fold and AUC by approximately 2 - fold , compared with administration of ibrutinib after overnight fasting .
In vitro studies suggest that ibrutinib is not a substrate of p - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) or breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) .
Distribution Reversible binding of ibrutinib to human plasma protein in vitro was 97 . 3 % with no concentration dependence in the range of 50 ng / mL to 1000 ng / mL .
The volume of distribution ( Vd ) was 683 L , and the apparent volume of distribution at steady state ( Vd , ss / F ) was approximately 10 , 000 L . Elimination Intravenous clearance was 62 L / h in fasted conditions and 76 L / h in fed conditions .
In line with the high first - pass effect , the apparent oral clearance is 2000 L / h in fasted conditions and 1000 L / h in fed conditions .
The half - life of ibrutinib is 4 hours to 6 hours .
Metabolism Metabolism is the main route of elimination for ibrutinib .
It is metabolized to several metabolites primarily by cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3 A and to a minor extent by CYP2D6 .
The active metabolite , PCI - 45227 , is a dihydrodiol metabolite with inhibitory activity towards BTK approximately 15 times lower than that of ibrutinib .
The range of the mean metabolite to parent ratio for PCI - 45227 at steady - state is 1 to 2 . 8 .
Excretion Ibrutinib , mainly in the form of metabolites , is eliminated primarily via feces .
After a single oral administration of radiolabeled ibrutinib , 90 % of radioactivity was excreted within 168 hours , with 80 % excreted in the feces and less than 10 % eliminated in urine .
Unchanged ibrutinib accounted for 1 % of the radiolabeled excreted dose in feces and none in urine , with the remainder of the excreted dose being metabolites .
Specific Populations Age and Sex Age and sex have no clinically meaningful effect on ibrutinib pharmacokinetics .
Patients with Renal Impairment Mild and moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance [ CLcr ] > 25 mL / min as estimated by Cockcroft - Gault equation ) had no influence on the exposure of ibrutinib .
No data is available in patients with severe renal impairment ( CLcr < 25 mL / min ) or in patients on dialysis .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment The AUC of ibrutinib increased 2 . 7 - fold in subjects with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class A ) , 8 . 2 - fold in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class B ) and 9 . 8 - fold in subjects with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class C ) relative to subjects with normal liver function .
The Cmax of ibrutinib increased 5 . 2 - fold in mild hepatic impairment , 8 . 8 - fold in moderate hepatic impairment and 7 - fold in severe hepatic impairment relative to subjects with normal liver function [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients with cGVHD treated with ibrutinib at 240 mg / m2 once daily ( patients age ≥ 1 to < 12 years ) or 420 mg once daily ( patients age ≥ 12 years ) , the geometric mean ( % CV ) steady state AUC and Cmax in patients age ≥ 1 to < 12 years is 467 ( 102 % ) ng ● h / mL and 65 . 7 ( 96 % ) ng / mL , respectively , and in patients age ≥ 12 to < 17 years is 966 ( 78 % ) ng ● h / mL and 149 ( 79 % ) ng / mL , respectively .
Drug Interaction Studies Clinical Studies and Model - Informed Approaches Effect of CYP3A Inhibitors on Ibrutinib : The coadministration of multiple doses of ketoconazole ( strong CYP3A inhibitor ) increased the Cmax of ibrutinib by 29 - fold and AUC by 24 - fold .
The coadministration of multiple doses of voriconazole ( strong CYP3A inhibitor ) increased steady state Cmax of ibrutinib by 6 . 7 - fold and AUC by 5 . 7 - fold .
Simulations under fed conditions suggest that posaconazole ( strong CYP3A inhibitor ) may increase the AUC of ibrutinib 3 - fold to 10 - fold .
The coadministration of multiple doses of erythromycin ( moderate CYP3A inhibitor ) increased steady state Cmax of ibrutinib by 3 . 4 - fold and AUC by 3 - fold .
Effect of CYP3A Inducers on Ibrutinib : The coadministration of rifampin ( strong CYP3A inducer ) decreased the Cmax of ibrutinib by more than 13 - fold and AUC by more than 10 - fold .
Simulations suggest that efavirenz ( moderate CYP3A inducer ) may decrease the AUC of ibrutinib by 3 - fold .
In Vitro Studies Effect of Ibrutinib on CYP Substrates : In vitro studies suggest that ibrutinib and PCI - 45227 are unlikely to inhibit CYP1A2 , 2B6 , 2C8 , 2C9 , 2C19 , 2D6 or 3 A at clinical doses .
Both ibrutinib and PCI - 45227 are unlikely to induce CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 or CYP3A at clinical doses .
Effect of Ibrutinib on Substrates of Transporters : In vitro studies suggest that ibrutinib may inhibit BCRP and P - gp transport at clinical doses .
The coadministration of oral P - gp or BCRP substrates ( e . g . , digoxin , methotrexate ) with IMBRUVICA may increase their concentrations .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Ibrutinib was not carcinogenic in a 6 - month rasH2 mouse study at oral doses up to 2000 mg / kg / day resulting in exposures approximately 23 ( males ) to 37 ( females ) times higher than the exposure in humans at a dose of 560 mg daily [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 6 ) ] .
Ibrutinib was not mutagenic in a bacterial mutagenicity ( Ames ) assay , was not clastogenic in a chromosome aberration assay in mammalian ( CHO ) cells , nor was it clastogenic in an in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice at doses up to 2000 mg / kg .
Rats were administered oral daily doses of ibrutinib for 4 weeks prior to pairing and during pairing in males and 2 weeks prior to pairing and during pairing in females .
Treatment of female rats continued following pregnancy up to gestation day ( GD ) 7 , and treatment of male rats continued until end of study .
No effects on fertility or reproductive capacities were observed in male or female rats up to the maximum dose tested , 100 mg / kg / day ( Human Equivalent Dose [ HED ] 16 mg / kg ) .
