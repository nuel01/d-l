( 4 ) • • Severe hypersensitivity reactions to ABRAXANE .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • • Sensory neuropathy occurs frequently and may require dose reduction or treatment interruption .
( 5 . 2 ) • • Sepsis occurred in patients with or without neutropenia who received ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine ; interrupt ABRAXANE and gemcitabine until sepsis resolves , and if neutropenia , until neutrophils are at least 1500 cells / mm3 , then resume treatment at reduced dose levels .
( 5 . 3 ) • • Pneumonitis occurred with the use of ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine ; permanently discontinue treatment with ABRAXANE and gemcitabine .
( 5 . 4 ) • • Severe hypersensitivity reactions with fatal outcome have been reported .
Do not rechallenge with this drug .
( 4 , 5 . 5 ) • • Exposure and toxicity of paclitaxel can be increased in patients with hepatic impairment , consider dose reduction and closely monitor patients with hepatic impairment .
( 2 . 5 , 5 . 6 ) • • ABRAXANE contains albumin derived from human blood , which has a theoretical risk of viral transmission .
( 5 . 7 ) • • ABRAXANE can cause fetal harm .
Advise patients of potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception .
( 5 . 8 , 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) 5 . 1 Severe Myelosuppression Severe myelosuppression ( primarily neutropenia ) is dose - dependent and a dose - limiting toxicity of ABRAXANE .
In clinical studies , Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia occurred in 34 % of patients with metastatic breast cancer ( MBC ) , 47 % of patients with non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , and 38 % of patients with pancreatic cancer .
Monitor for severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia by performing complete blood cell counts frequently , including prior to dosing on Day 1 ( for MBC ) and Days 1 , 8 , and 15 ( for NSCLC and for pancreatic cancer ) .
Do not administer ABRAXANE to patients with baseline absolute neutrophil counts ( ANC ) of less than 1 , 500 cells / mm3 [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
In the case of severe neutropenia ( < 500 cells / mm3 for seven days or more ) during a course of ABRAXANE therapy , reduce the dose of ABRAXANE in subsequent courses in patients with either MBC or NSCLC .
In patients with MBC , resume treatment with every - 3 - week cycles of ABRAXANE after ANC recovers to a level > 1 , 500 cells / mm3 and platelets recover to a level > 100 , 000 cells / mm3 .
In patients with NSCLC , resume treatment if recommended at permanently reduced doses for both weekly ABRAXANE and every - 3 - week carboplatin after ANC recovers to at least 1500 cells / mm3 and platelet count of at least 100 , 000 cells / mm3 on Day 1 or to an ANC of at least 500 cells / mm3 and platelet count of at least 50 , 000 cells / mm3 on Days 8 or 15 of the cycle [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
In patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas , withhold ABRAXANE and gemcitabine if the ANC is less than 500 cells / mm3 or platelets are less than 50 , 000 cells / mm3 and delay initiation of the next cycle if the ANC is less than 1500 cells / mm3 or platelet count is less than 100 , 000 cells / mm3 on Day 1 of the cycle .
Resume treatment with appropriate dose reduction if recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
5 . 2 Severe Neuropathy Sensory neuropathy is dose - and schedule - dependent [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
If ≥ Grade 3 sensory neuropathy develops , withhold ABRAXANE treatment until resolution to Grade 1 or 2 for metastatic breast cancer or until resolution to ≤ Grade 1 for NSCLC and pancreatic cancer followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses of ABRAXANE [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
5 . 3 Sepsis Sepsis occurred in 5 % of patients with or without neutropenia who received ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine .
Biliary obstruction or presence of biliary stent were risk factors for severe or fatal sepsis .
If a patient becomes febrile ( regardless of ANC ) initiate treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics .
For febrile neutropenia , interrupt ABRAXANE and gemcitabine until fever resolves and ANC ≥ 1500 , then resume treatment at reduced dose levels [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 6 ) ] .
5 . 4 Pneumonitis Pneumonitis , including some cases that were fatal , occurred in 4 % of patients receiving ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine .
Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis and interrupt ABRAXANE and gemcitabine during evaluation of suspected pneumonitis .
After ruling out infectious etiology and upon making a diagnosis of pneumonitis , permanently discontinue treatment with ABRAXANE and gemcitabine .
5 . 5 Severe Hypersensitivity Severe and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity reactions , including anaphylactic reactions , have been reported .
Do not rechallenge patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reaction to ABRAXANE with this drug [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Cross - hypersensitivity between ABRAXANE and other taxane products has been reported and may include severe reactions such as anaphylaxis .
Closely monitor patients with a previous history of hypersensitivity to other taxanes during initiation of ABRAXANE therapy .
5 . 6 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The exposure and toxicity of paclitaxel can be increased in patients with hepatic impairment .
Closely monitor patients with hepatic impairment for severe myelosuppression .
ABRAXANE is not recommended in patients who have total bilirubin > 5 x ULN or AST > 10 x ULN .
In addition , ABRAXANE is not recommended in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have moderate to severe hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 x ULN and AST ≤ 10 x ULN ) .
Reduce the starting dose for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
5 . 7 Albumin ( Human ) ABRAXANE contains albumin ( human ) , a derivative of human blood .
Based on effective donor screening and product manufacturing processes , it carries a remote risk for transmission of viral diseases .
A theoretical risk for transmission of Creutzfeldt - Jakob Disease ( CJD ) also is considered extremely remote .
No cases of transmission of viral diseases or CJD have ever been identified for albumin .
5 . 8 Embryo - Fetal Toxicity Based on mechanism of action and findings in animals , ABRAXANE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of paclitaxel formulated as albumin - bound particles to rats during pregnancy at doses lower than the maximum recommended human dose , based on body surface area , caused embryo - fetal toxicities , including intrauterine mortality , increased resorptions , reduced numbers of live fetuses , and malformations .
Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus .
Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception and avoid becoming pregnant during treatment with ABRAXANE and for at least six months after the last dose of ABRAXANE [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
Based on findings from genetic toxicity and animal reproduction studies , advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception and avoid fathering a child during treatment with ABRAXANE and for at least three months after the last dose of ABRAXANE [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 , 8 . 3 ) , Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .

( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals , ABRAXANE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
There are no available human data on ABRAXANE use in pregnant women to inform the drug - associated risk .
In animal reproduction studies , administration of paclitaxel formulated as albumin - bound particles to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in embryo - fetal toxicity at doses approximately 2 % of the daily maximum recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis ( see Data ) .
Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus .
The background rate of major birth defects and miscarriage is unknown for the indicated population .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In embryo - fetal development studies , intravenous administration of paclitaxel formulated as albumin - bound particles to rats during pregnancy , on gestation days 7 to 17 at doses of 6 mg / m2 ( approximately 2 % of the daily maximum recommended human dose on a mg / m2 basis ) caused embryo - fetal toxicities , as indicated by intrauterine mortality , increased resorptions ( up to 5 - fold ) , reduced numbers of litters and live fetuses , reduction in fetal body weight , and increase in fetal anomalies .
Fetal anomalies included soft tissue and skeletal malformations , such as eye bulge , folded retina , microphthalmia , and dilation of brain ventricles .

10 OVERDOSAGE There is no known antidote for ABRAXANE overdosage .
The primary anticipated complications of overdosage would consist of bone marrow suppression , sensory neurotoxicity , and mucositis .
11 DESCRIPTION ABRAXANE for Injectable Suspension ( paclitaxel protein - bound particles for injectable suspension ) ( albumin - bound ) is paclitaxel formulated as albumin - bound nanoparticles with a mean particle size of approximately 130 nanometers .
Paclitaxel exists in the particles in a non - crystalline , amorphous state .
Paclitaxel is a microtubule inhibitor .
The chemical name for paclitaxel is 5β , 20 - Epoxy - 1 , 2α , 4 , 7β , 10β , 13α - hexahydroxytax - 11 - en - 9 - one 4 , 10 - diacetate 2 - benzoate 13 - ester with ( 2 R , 3 S ) - N - benzoyl - 3 - phenylisoserine .
The empirical formula is C47H51NO14 and the molecular weight is 853 . 91 .
Paclitaxel has the following structural formula : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Paclitaxel is a white to off - white crystalline powder .
It is highly lipophilic , insoluble in water , and melts at approximately 216 ° C to 217 ° C . ABRAXANE is supplied as a white to yellow , sterile , lyophilized powder for reconstitution with 20 mL of 0 . 9 % Sodium Chloride Injection , USP prior to intravenous infusion .
Each single ‑ dose vial contains 100 mg of paclitaxel ( bound to human albumin ) and approximately 900 mg of human albumin ( containing sodium caprylate and sodium acetyltryptophanate ) .
Each milliliter ( mL ) of reconstituted suspension contains 5 mg paclitaxel formulated as albumin ‑ bound particles .
ABRAXANE is free of solvents .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action ABRAXANE is a microtubule inhibitor that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by preventing depolymerization .
This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions .
Paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or " bundles " of microtubules throughout the cell cycle and multiple asters of microtubules during mitosis .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30 - and 180 - minute infusions of ABRAXANE at dose levels of 80 to 375 mg / m2 ( 0 . 31 to 1 . 15 times the maximum approved recommended dosage ) were determined in clinical studies .
Dose levels of mg / m2 refer to mg of paclitaxel in ABRAXANE .
Following intravenous administration of ABRAXANE to patients with solid tumors , paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a biphasic manner , the initial rapid decline representing distribution to the peripheral compartment and the slower second phase representing drug elimination .
Following ABRAXANE infusion , paclitaxel exhibited linear drug exposure ( AUC ) across clinical doses ranging from 80 to 300 mg / m2 ( 0 . 31 to 1 . 15 times the maximum approved recommended dosage ) .
The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in ABRAXANE were independent of the duration of intravenous administration .
The pharmacokinetic data of 260 mg / m2 ABRAXANE administered over a 30 - minute infusion was compared to the pharmacokinetics of 175 mg / m2 paclitaxel injection over a 3 - hour infusion .
Clearance was larger ( 43 % ) and the volume of distribution was higher ( 53 % ) for ABRAXANE than for paclitaxel injection .
There were no differences in terminal half - lives .
Distribution Following ABRAXANE administration to patients with solid tumors , paclitaxel is evenly distributed into blood cells and plasma and is highly bound to plasma proteins ( 94 % ) .
The total volume of distribution is approximately 1741 L ; the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular distribution and / or tissue binding of paclitaxel .
In a within - patient comparison study , the fraction of unbound paclitaxel in plasma was significantly higher with ABRAXANE ( 6 . 2 % ) than with solvent - based paclitaxel ( 2 . 3 % ) .
This contributes to significantly higher exposure to unbound paclitaxel with ABRAXANE compared with solvent - based paclitaxel , when the total exposure is comparable .
In vitro studies of binding to human serum proteins , using paclitaxel concentrations ranging from 0 . 1 to 50 µg / mL , indicated that the presence of cimetidine , ranitidine , dexamethasone , or diphenhydramine did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel .
Elimination At the clinical dose range of 80 to 300 mg / m2 ( 0 . 31 to 1 . 15 times the maximum approved recommended dosage ) , the mean total clearance of paclitaxel ranges from 13 to 30 L / h / m2 and the mean terminal half - life ranges from 13 to 27 hours .
Metabolism In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices showed that paclitaxel in ABRAXANE was metabolized primarily to 6α - hydroxypaclitaxel by CYP2C8 ; and to two minor metabolites , 3 ' - p - hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α , 3 ' - p - dihydroxypaclitaxel , by CYP3A4 .
In vitro , the metabolism of paclitaxel to 6α - hydroxypaclitaxel was inhibited by a number of agents ( ketoconazole , verapamil , diazepam , quinidine , dexamethasone , cyclosporin , teniposide , etoposide , and vincristine ) , but the concentrations used exceeded those found in vivo following normal therapeutic doses .
Testosterone , 17α - ethinyl estradiol , retinoic acid , and quercetin , a specific inhibitor of CYP2C8 , also inhibited the formation of 6α - hydroxypaclitaxel in vitro .
The pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel may also be altered in vivo as a result of interactions with compounds that are substrates , inducers , or inhibitors of CYP2C8 and / or CYP3A4 [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] .
Excretion After a 30 - minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 doses of ABRAXANE , the mean values for cumulative urinary recovery of unchanged drug ( 4 % ) indicated extensive non - renal clearance .
Less than 1 % of the total administered dose was excreted in urine as the metabolites 6α - hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 ' - p - hydroxypaclitaxel .
Fecal excretion was approximately 20 % of the total dose administered .
Specific Populations No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in ABRAXANE were observed based on body weight ( 40 to 143 kg ) , body surface area ( 1 . 3 to 2 . 4 m2 ) , sex , race ( Asian vs . White ) , age ( 24 to 85 years ) , type of solid tumors , mild to moderate renal impairment ( creatinine clearance 30 to < 90 mL / min ) , and mild hepatic impairment ( total bilirubin > 1 to ≤ 1 . 5 x ULN and AST ≤ 10 x ULN ) .
Patients with moderate ( total bilirubin > 1 . 5 to 3 x ULN and AST ≤ 10 x ULN ) or severe ( total bilirubin > 3 to 5 x ULN ) hepatic impairment had a 22 % to 26 % decrease in the maximum elimination rate of paclitaxel and approximately 20 % increase in mean paclitaxel AUC compared with patients with normal hepatic function ( total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST ≤ ULN ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 5 ) and Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
The effect of severe renal impairment or end stage renal disease ( creatinine clearance < 30 mL / min ) on the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in ABRAXANE is unknown .
Drug Interaction Studies Carboplatin : Administration of carboplatin immediately after the completion of the ABRAXANE infusion to patients with NSCLC did not cause clinically meaningful changes in paclitaxel exposure .
The observed mean AUCinf of free carboplatin was approximately 23 % higher than the targeted value ( 6 min * mg / mL ) , but its mean half - life and clearance were consistent with those reported in the absence of paclitaxel .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility The carcinogenic potential of ABRAXANE has not been studied .
Paclitaxel was clastogenic in vitro ( chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes ) and in vivo ( micronucleus test in mice ) .
Paclitaxel was not mutagenic in the Ames test or the CHO / HGPRT gene mutation assay .
Administration of paclitaxel formulated as albumin - bound particles to male rats at 42 mg / m2 on a weekly basis ( approximately 16 % of the daily maximum recommended human exposure on a body surface area basis ) for 11 weeks prior to mating with untreated female rats resulted in significantly reduced fertility accompanied by decreased pregnancy rates and increased loss of embryos in mated females .
A dose of 42 mg / m2 also reduced male reproductive organ weights , mating performance , and sperm production .
Testicular atrophy / degeneration was observed in single - dose toxicology studies in animals administered paclitaxel formulated as albumin - bound particles at doses lower than the recommended human dose ; doses were 54 mg / m2 in rodents and 175 mg / m2 in dogs .
Similar testicular degeneration was seen in monkeys administered three weekly doses of 108 mg / m2 paclitaxel formulated as albumin bound particles .
Administration of paclitaxel prior to and during mating produced impairment of fertility in male and female rats .
Paclitaxel caused reduced fertility and reproductive indices , and increased embryo - fetal toxicity .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 Metastatic Breast Cancer Data from 106 patients accrued in two single arm open label studies and from 460 patients enrolled in a randomized comparative study were available to support the use of ABRAXANE in metastatic breast cancer .
Single Arm Open Label Studies In one study , ABRAXANE was administered as a 30 - minute infusion at a dose of 175 mg / m2 to 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
The second trial utilized a dose of 300 mg / m2 as a 30 - minute infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
Cycles were administered at 3 - week intervals .
Objective responses were observed in both studies .
Randomized Comparative Study This multicenter trial was conducted in 460 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
Patients were randomized to receive ABRAXANE at a dose of 260 mg / m2 given as a 30 - minute infusion , or paclitaxel injection at 175 mg / m2 given as a 3 - hour infusion .
Sixty - four percent of patients had impaired performance status ( ECOG 1 or 2 ) at study entry ; 79 % had visceral metastases ; and 76 % had > 3 sites of metastases .
Fourteen percent of the patients had not received prior chemotherapy ; 27 % had received chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting , 40 % in the metastatic setting and 19 % in both metastatic and adjuvant settings .
Fifty - nine percent received study drug as second or greater than second - line therapy .
Seventy - seven percent of the patients had been previously exposed to anthracyclines .
In this trial , patients in the ABRAXANE treatment arm had a statistically significantly higher reconciled target lesion response rate ( the trial primary endpoint ) of 21 . 5 % ( 95 % CI : 16 . 2 % to 26 . 7 % ) , compared to 11 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 6 . 9 % to 15 . 1 % ) for patients in the paclitaxel injection treatment arm .
See Table 11 .
There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two study arms .
Table 11 : Efficacy Results from Randomized Metastatic Breast Cancer Triala Reconciled Target Lesion Response Rate ( TLRR ) was the prospectively defined protocol specific endpoint , based on independent radiologic assessment of tumor responses reconciled with investigator responses ( which also included clinical information ) for the first 6 cycles of therapy .
The reconciled TLRR was lower than the investigator Reported Response Rates , which are based on all cycles of therapy .
b From Cochran - Mantel - Haenszel test stratified by 1 st line vs . > 1 st line therapy .
c Prior therapy included an anthracycline unless clinically contraindicated .

ABRAXANE was administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at a dose of 100 mg / m2 on Days 1 , 8 , and 15 of each 21 - day cycle .
Paclitaxel injection was administered as an intravenous infusion over 3 hours at a dose of 200 mg / m2 , following premedication .
In both treatment arms carboplatin at a dose of AUC = 6 mg • min / mL was administered intravenously on Day 1 of each 21 - day cycle after completion of ABRAXANE / paclitaxel infusion .
Treatment was administered until disease progression or development of an unacceptable toxicity .
The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate as determined by a central independent review committee using RECIST guidelines ( Version 1 . 0 ) .
In the intent - to - treat ( all - randomized ) population , the median age was 60 years , 75 % were men , 81 % were White , 49 % had adenocarcinoma , 43 % had squamous cell lung cancer , 76 % were ECOG PS 1 , and 73 % were current or former smokers .
Patients received a median of 6 cycles of treatment in both study arms .
Patients in the ABRAXANE / carboplatin arm had a statistically significantly higher overall response rate compared to patients in the paclitaxel injection / carboplatin arm [ ( 33 % versus 25 % ) see Table 12 ] .
There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the two study arms .

Key eligibility criteria were Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) ≥ 70 , normal bilirubin level , transaminase levels ≤ 2 . 5 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) or ≤ 5 times the ULN for patients with liver metastasis , no prior cytotoxic chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting or for metastatic disease , no ongoing active infection requiring systemic therapy , and no history of interstitial lung disease .
Patients with rapid decline in KPS ( ≥ 10 % ) or serum albumin ( ≥ 20 % ) during the 14 day screening period prior to study randomization were ineligible .
A total of 861 patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to the ABRAXANE / gemcitabine arm ( N = 431 ) or to the gemcitabine arm ( N = 430 ) .
Randomization was stratified by geographic region ( Australia , Western Europe , Eastern Europe , or North America ) , KPS ( 70 to 80 versus 90 to 100 ) , and presence of liver metastasis ( yes versus no ) .
Patients randomized to ABRAXANE / gemcitabine received ABRAXANE 125 mg / m2 as an intravenous infusion over 30 - 40 minutes followed by gemcitabine 1000 mg / m2 as an intravenous infusion over 30 - 40 minutes on Days 1 , 8 , and 15 of each 28 - day cycle .
Patients randomized to gemcitabine received 1000 mg / m2 as an intravenous infusion over 30 - 40 minutes weekly for 7 weeks followed by a 1 - week rest period in Cycle 1 then as 1000 mg / m2 on Days 1 , 8 , and 15 of each subsequent 28 - day cycle .
Patients in both arms received treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival ( OS ) .
Additional outcome measures were progression - free survival ( PFS ) and overall response rate ( ORR ) , both assessed by independent , central , blinded radiological review using RECIST ( version 1 . 0 ) .
In the intent - to - treat ( all randomized ) population , the median age was 63 years ( range 27 - 88 years ) with 42 % ≥ 65 years of age ; 58 % were men ; 93 % were White and KPS was 90 - 100 in 60 % .
Disease characteristics included 46 % of patients with 3 or more metastatic sites ; 84 % of patients had liver metastasis ; and the location of the primary pancreatic lesion was in the head of pancreas ( 43 % ) , body ( 31 % ) , or tail ( 25 % ) .
Results for overall survival , progression - free survival , and overall response rate are shown in Table 13 .
