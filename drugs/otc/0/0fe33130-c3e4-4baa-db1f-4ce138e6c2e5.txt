Treatment of Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency As there are significant differences in the half - life of IgG among patients with primary humoral immunodeficiencies , the frequency and amount of immunoglobulin therapy may vary from patient to patient .
The proper amount can be determined by monitoring clinical response .
The dose of Octagam 5 % liquid for replacement therapy in primary humoral immunodeficiency diseases is 300 to 600 mg / kg body weight ( 6 - 12 ml / kg ) administered every 3 to 4 weeks .
The dosage may be adjusted over time to achieve the desired trough levels and clinical responses .
If a patient is at risk of measles exposure ( ie . , outbreak in US or travel to endemic areas outside of the US ) and receives a dose of less than 400 mg / kg every 3 to 4 weeks , the dose should be increased to at least 400 mg / kg .
If a patient has been exposed to measles , this dose should be administered as soon as possible after exposure .
Missed Doses If a patient on regular treatment missed a dose , the missed dose should be administered as soon as possible , and then treatment should continue as before .
Administration Octagam 5 % liquid should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container permit .
Do not use if turbid and / or discoloration is observed .
Octagam 5 % liquid should be at room temperature during administration .
Only administer intravenously .
Any bottle that has been opened should be used promptly .

DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Octagam 5 % liquid is supplied in 1 . 0 g , 2 . 5 g , 5 g , 10 g or 25 g single use bottles ( See How Supplied / Storage and Handling [ 16 ] ) .
Octagam 5 % liquid is supplied in 1 . 0 g , 2 . 5 g , 5 g , 10 g or 25 g single use bottles ( 3 , 16 ) CONTRAINDICATIONS Octagam 5 % liquid is contraindicated in patients who have acute severe hypersensitivity reactions to human immunoglobulin .
Octagam 5 % liquid contains trace amounts of IgA ( not more than 0 . 2 mg / ml in a 5 % solution ) .
It is contraindicated in IgA deficient patients with antibodies against IgA and history of hypersensitivity ( See Description [ 11 ] ) .
Octagam 5 % liquid is contraindicated in patients with acute hypersensitivity reaction to corn .
Octagam 5 % liquid contains maltose , a disaccharide sugar which is derived from corn .
Patients known to have corn allergies should avoid using Octagam 5 % liquid .
Anaphylactic or severe systemic reactions to human immunoglobulin ( 4 ) IgA deficient patients with antibodies against IgA and a history of hypersensitivity ( 4 ) Patients with acute hypersensitivity reaction to corn ( 4 ) WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS IgA deficient patients with antibodies against IgA are at greater risk of developing severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions Epinephrine should be available immediately to treat any acute severe hypersensitivity reactions .
( 5 . 1 ) Monitor renal function , including blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine , and urine output in patients at risk of developing acute renal failure .
( 5 . 2 ) Falsely elevated blood glucose readings may occur during and after the infusion of Octagam 5 % liquid with some glucometer and test strip systems ( 5 . 3 ) Hyperproteinemia , increased serum viscosity and hyponatremia occur in patients receiving IGIV therapy .
( 5 . 4 ) Thrombotic events have occurred in patients receiving IGIV therapy .
Monitor patients with known risk factors for thrombotic events ; consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity for those at risk of hyperviscosity .
( 5 . 5 ) Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome has been reported with Octagam 5 % liquid and other IGIV treatments , especially with high doses or rapid infusion .
( 5 . 6 ) Hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration ( 5 . 7 ) IGIV recipients should be monitored for pulmonary adverse reactions ( TRALI ) ( 5 . 8 ) The product is made from human plasma and may contain infectious agents , e . g . viruses and , theoretically , the Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease agent ( 5 . 9 ) Sensitivity Severe hypersensitivity reactions may occur [ 1 ] ( See Contraindications [ 4 . 1 ] ) .
In case of hypersensitivity , Octagam 5 % liquid infusion should be immediately discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted .
Epinephrine should be immediately available for treatment of acute severe hypersensitivity reaction .
IgA deficient patients with antibodies against IgA are at greater risk of developing severe hypersensitivity and anaphylactoid reactions when administered Octagam 5 % liquid ( See Contraindications [ 4 . 2 ] ) .
Patients known to have corn allergies should avoid using Octagam 5 % liquid ( See Contraindications [ 4 . 3 ] ) .
Renal Failure Assure that patients are not volume depleted prior to the initiation of the infusion of Octagam 5 % liquid .
Periodic monitoring of renal function tests and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to have a potential increased risk of developing acute renal failure .
Renal function , including a measurement of blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) / serum creatinine , should be assessed prior to the initial infusion of Octagam 5 % liquid and again at appropriate intervals thereafter .
If renal function deteriorates , discontinuation of the product should be considered ( See Patient Counselling Information [ 17 ] ) For patients judged to be at risk for developing renal dysfunction and / or at risk of developing thrombotic events , it may be prudent to reduce the amount of product infused per unit time by infusing Octagam 5 % liquid at a maximum rate less than 0 . 07 ml / kg ( 3 . 3 mg / kg ) / minute ( 200 mg / kg / hour ) ( See Boxed Warning , and Dosage and Administration [ 2 . 4 ] ) .
Blood Glucose Monitoring Blood Glucose Testing [ 2 ] : some types of blood glucose testing systems ( for example , those based on the glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinolinequinone ( GDH - PQQ ) or glucose - dye - oxidoreductase methods ) falsely interpret the maltose contained in Octagam 5 % liquid as glucose .
This has resulted in falsely elevated glucose readings and , consequently , in the inappropriate administration of insulin , resulting in life - threatening hypoglycemia .
Also , cases of true hypoglycemia may go untreated if the hypoglycemic state is masked by falsely elevated glucose readings .
Accordingly , when administering Octagam 5 % liquid , the measurement of blood glucose must be done with a glucose - specific method .
The product information of the blood glucose testing system , including that of the test strips , should be carefully reviewed to determine if the system is appropriate for use with maltose - containing parenteral products .
If any uncertainty exists , contact the manufacturer of the testing system to determine if the system is appropriate for use with maltose - containing parenteral products .
Hyperproteinemia Hyperproteinemia , increased serum viscosity and hyponatremia may occur in patients receiving IGIV therapy .
The hyponatremia is likely to be a pseudohyponatremia as demonstrated by a decreased calculated serum osmolality or elevated osmolar gap .
Distinguishing true hyponatremia from pseudohyponatremia is clinically critical , as treatment aimed at decreasing serum free water in patients with pseudohyponatremia may lead to volume depletion , a further increase in serum viscosity and a disposition to thromboembolic events [ 3 ] .
Thrombotic events Thrombotic events have been reported in association with IGIV therapy [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .
Patients at risk may include those with a history of atherosclerosis , multiple cardiovascular risk factors , advanced age , impaired cardiac output , coagulation disorders , prolonged periods of immobilization and / or known or suspected hyperviscosity .
The potential risks and benefits of IGIV should be weighed against those of alternative therapies for all patients for whom IGIV administration is being considered .
Baseline assessment of blood viscosity should be considered in patients at risk for hyperviscosity , including those with cryoglobulins , fasting chylomicronemia / markedly high triacylglycerols ( triglycerides ) , or monoclonal gammopathies .
Aseptic meningitis syndrome Aseptic meningitis syndrome ( AMS ) has been reported to occur infrequently in association with IGIV treatment .
Discontinuation of IGIV treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae .
The syndrome usually begins within several hours to two days following IGIV treatment and rapid infusion .
It is characterized by symptoms and signs including severe headache , nuchal rigidity , drowsiness , fever , photophobia , painful eye movements , nausea and vomiting .
Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) studies are frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per cu mm , predominantly from the granulocytic series , and elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg / dl .
Patients exhibiting such symptoms and signs should receive a thorough neurological examination , including CSF studies , to rule out other causes of meningitis .
It appears that patients with a history of migraine may be more susceptible .
[ 7 ] ( See Patient Counselling Information [ 17 ] ) .
Hemolysis IGIV products can contain blood group antibodies which may act as hemolysins and induce in vivo coating of red blood cells with immunoglobulin , causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction and , rarely , hemolysis [ 8 ] .
Hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration [ See ADVERSE REACTIONS ] [ 9 ] .
IGIV recipients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis .
If signs and / or symptoms of hemolysis are present after IGIV infusion , appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing should be done ( See Patient Counseling Information [ 17 ] ) .
Transfusion - Related Acute Lung Injury ( TRALI ) There have been reports of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema [ Transfusion - Related Acute Lung Injury ( TRALI ) ] in patients administered IGIV [ 10 ] .
TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress , pulmonary edema , hypoxemia , normal left ventricular function , and fever and typically occurs within 1 - 6 hours after transfusion .
Patients with TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support .
IGIV recipients should be monitored for pulmonary adverse reactions ( See Patient Counseling Information [ 17 ] ) .
If TRALI is suspected , appropriate tests should be performed for the presence of anti - neutrophil antibodies in both the product and patient serum .
General Because this product is made from human blood , it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents , e . g . , viruses and theoretically , the Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease ( CJD ) agent .
All infections thought by a physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported by the physician or other healthcare provider to Octapharma .
The physician should discuss the risks and benefits of this product with the patient , before prescribing or administering it to the patient ( See Patient Counseling Information [ 17 ] ) .
Laboratory Tests If signs and / or symptoms of hemolysis are present after IGIV infusion , appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing should be done .
If TRALI is susppected , appropriate tests should be performed for the presence of anti - neutrophil antibodies in both the product and patient serum .
Because of the potentially increased risk of thrombosis , baseline assessment of blood viscosity should be considered in patients at risk for hyperviscosity , including those with cryoglobulins , fasting chylomicronemia / markedly high triacylglycerols ( triglycerides ) , or monoclonal gammopathies .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions with an incidence of > 5 % during a clinical trial were headache and nausea .

Adverse Drug Reaction Overview The most serious adverse reactions observed with Octagam 5 % Liquid treatment have been immediate anaphylactic reactions , aseptic meningitis , and hemolytic anemia .
The most common adverse reactions observed with Octagam 5 % Liquid treatment during clinical trial ( > 5 % ) were headache and nausea .
Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a product cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another product and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice .
The clinical trial database includes a multi - center , open - label , single arm study in 46 children and adults with PI .
Subjects participated in the study for a mean of 346 days and received 300 to 450 mg / kg every 21 days or 400 to 600 mg / kg every 28 days .
Infusions were initiated at a rate of 30 mg / kg / hour for the first 30 minutes , and , if tolerated , could be advanced to a maximum tolerated rate not exceeding 200 mg / kg / hour .
Over half of the subjects were male ( n = 28 ; 61 % ) , and more than half were on the 28 - day infusion schedule ( n = 27 ; 59 % ) .
The mean age of subjects was 31 . 5 years .
Six subjects experienced a total of 12 SAEs ( abdominal pain ( 2 occurrences ) , cardiac arrest , pneumonia , cellulitis , coxsackie viral infection , renal calculus ( 2 occurrences ) , blood culture positive , ketonuria , gastroenteritis , and colitis pseudomembranosus ) .
Eleven of the 12 SAEs were not suspected to be related to study drug ; the other SAE was noted before the subject began receiving the next scheduled infusion , and it was not temporally related to the previous infusion .
Pre - medications were used in 165 ( 25 . 2 % ) out of 654 infusions and in 14 ( 30 . 4 % ) out of 46 patients .
Infusions were slowed or interrupted in 9 out of 489 infusions ( 1 . 84 % ) without pre - medication and in 10 out of 165 infusions ( 6 . 06 % ) with pre - medication .
Five out of 32 ( 15 . 63 % ) patients who never received any pre - medication had at least one slowed or interrupted infusion , whereas 9 out of 14 ( 64 . 29 % ) patients who received pre - medication at least once also had a slowed or interrupted infusion .
Six of the 46 subjects in the trial ( 13 % ) were withdrawn from the study : 2 on the subjects ' request ; 1 because of investigator ' s decision ( non - compliance ) ; 1 because of loss to follow - up ; 1 death ( cardiac arrest , not suspected to be related to study drug ) ; and 1 by error of the study coordinator .
All adverse events in trial OCTA - 06 , irrespective of the causality assessment , reported by at least 5 % of subjects during the 12 - months treatment are given in the table below .

Three subjects ( 7 % ) had incidences of AST ( > 2 . 5 x ULN ) which were all assessed as clinically non - significant .
Four subjects ( 9 % ) had incidences of serum creatinine increases being stable throughout the course of the study .
Therefore , these observations were not regarded as indicative of acute renal dysfunction .
Postmarketing Experience Because postmarketing reporting of adverse reactions is voluntary and from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency of these reactions or establish a causal relationship to product exposure .
Octagam 5 % liquid Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of Octagam 5 % liquid .

It is recommended that Octagam 5 % liquid be administered separately from other drugs or medications which the patient may be receiving .
The product should not be mixed with IGIVs from other manufacturers .
The infusion line may be flushed before and after administration of Octagam 5 % liquid with either normal saline or 5 % dextrose in water .
Various passively transferred antibodies in immunoglobulin preparations can confound the results of serological testing .
Antibodies in Octagam 5 % liquid may interfere with the response to live viral vaccines , such as measles , mumps , and rubella .
Physicians should be informed of recent therapy with IGIVs , so that administration of live viral vaccines , if indicated , can be appropriately delayed 3 or more months from the time of IGIV administration .
The passive transfer of antibodies may confound the results of serological testing ( 7 ) .
The passive transfer of antibodies may interfere with the response to live viral vaccines ( 7 ) .
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : no human or animal data .
Use only if clearly needed ( 8 . 1 ) .
In patients over age 65 or in any person at risk of developing renal insufficiency , do not exceed the recommended dose , and infuse Octagam 5 % liquid at the minimum infusion rate practicable ( 8 . 5 ) .
See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION .
Revised : September 2009 _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Pregnancy Pregnancy Category C . Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Octagam 5 % liquid .
It is also not known whether Octagam 5 % liquid can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Octagam 5 % liquid should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Nursing Mothers Octagam 5 % liquid has not been evaluated in nursing mothers .
Pediatric Use Octagam 5 % liquid was evaluated in 11 pediatric subjects ( age range 6 – 16 years ) .
There were no obvious differences observed between adults and pediatric subjects with respect to pharmacokinetics , efficacy and safety .
No pediatric specific dose requirements were necessary to achieve the desired serum IgG levels .
Geriatric Use Patients > 65 years of age may be at increased risk for developing certain adverse reactions such as thromboembolic events and acute renal failure ( See Boxed Warnings and Precautions [ 5 . 3 ] ) .
In the clinical trial only 4 geriatric patients ( > 65 years ) were enrolled , a number insufficient to determine whether geriatric patients respond differently from younger subjects .
In these 4 patients no particular issues were observed .
OVERDOSAGE Overdose may lead to fluid overload and hyperviscosity , particularly in the elderly and in patients with impaired renal function .
DESCRIPTION Immune Globulin Intravenous ( Human ) , Octagam 5 % liquid , is a solvent / detergent ( S / D ) - treated , sterile preparation of highly purified immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) derived from large pools of human plasma .
Octagam 5 % liquid is a solution for infusion which must be administered intravenously .
All units of human plasma used in the manufacture of Octagam 5 % liquid are provided by FDA - approved blood establishments only , and are tested by FDA - licensed serological tests for HBsAg , antibodies to HCV and HIV and Nucleic Acid Test ( NAT ) for HCV and HIV - 1 and found to be non - reactive ( negative ) .
The product is manufactured by the cold ethanol fractionation process followed by ultrafiltration and chromatography .
The manufacturing process includes treatment with an organic S / D mixture composed of tri - n - butyl phosphate ( TNBP ) and Triton X - 100 ( Octoxynol ) .
The Octagam 5 % liquid manufacturing process provides a significant viral reduction in in vitro studies ( table 7 ) .
These reductions are achieved through a combination of process steps including cold ethanol fractionation , S / D treatment and pH 4 treatment .
Table 7 : In vitro reduction factor during Octagam 5 % liquid manufacturing [ MULTIMEDIA ] WNV : West Nile Virus HIV - 1 : Human Immunodeficiency Virus - 1 PRV : Pseudorabies Virus SBV : Sindbis Virus MEV : Mouse Encephalomyelitis Virus PPV : Porcine Parvovirus [ MULTIMEDIA ] Composition The composition of Octagam 5 % liquid is shown in table 8 as follows : Table 8 : Composition Component Quantity / ml Protein , of which not less than 96 % is human normal immunoglobulin G 50 mg Maltose 100 mg Triton X - 100 not more than 5 mcg TNBP not more than 1 mcg IgA not more than 0 . 2 mg IgM not more than 0 . 1 mg Water for Injection ad .
This preparation contains approximately 50 mg of protein per ml ( 5 % ) of which not less than 96 % is human normal immunoglobulin G . Octagam 5 % liquid contains not more than 3 % aggregates , not less than 90 % monomers and dimers and not more than 3 % fragments .
The sodium content of the final solution is not more than 30 mmol / l and the pH is between 5 . 1 and 6 . 0 .
The osmolality is 310 - 380 mosmol / kg .
The manufacturing process for Octagam 5 % liquid isolates IgG without additional chemical or enzymatic modification , and the Fc portion is maintained intact Octagam 5 % liquid contains the IgG antibody activities present in the donor population .
IgG subclasses are fully represented with the following approximate percents of total IgG : IgG 1 is 65 % , IgG 2 is 30 % , IgG 3 is 3 % and IgG 4 is 2 % .
Octagam 5 % liquid contains a broad spectrum of IgG antibodies against bacterial and viral agents that are capable of opsonization and neutralization of microbes and toxins .
Octagam 5 % liquid contains no preservative and no sucrose .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism of Action Octagam 5 % liquid supplies a broad spectrum of opsonic and neutralizing IgG antibodies against bacteria or their toxins .
The mechanism of action in PI has not been fully elucidated .
Pharmacodynamics Octagam 5 % liquid contains mainly immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) with a broad spectrum of antibodies against various infectious agents reflecting the IgG activity found in the donor population .
Octagam 5 % liquid which is prepared from pooled material from not less than 1000 donors , has an IgG subclass distribution similar to that of native human plasma .
Adequate doses of IGIV can restore abnormally low IgG level to the normal range .
Standard pharmacodynamic studies were not performed .
Pharmacokinetics Peak levels of IgG are reached immediately after infusion of Octagam 5 % liquid .
It has been shown that after infusion , exogenous IgG is distributed relatively rapidly between plasma and extravascular fluid until approximately half is partitioned in the extravascular space .
Therefore a rapid initial drop in serum IgG is expected [ 11 ] .
Studies show that the apparent half - life of Octagam 5 % liquid is approximately 40 days in immunodeficient patients .
The main pharmacokinetic parameters of Octagam 5 % liquid measured as total IgG in study OCTA - 06 are displayed below : In the pharmacokinetic study , a subset of 14 patients aged between 10 and 70 years with PI underwent pharmacokinetic assessments .
Patients received infusions of Octagam 5 % liquid ( 300 to 600 mg / kg ) every 3 ( n = 6 ) to 4 ( n = 8 ) weeks for 12 months .
Pharmacokinetic samples were collected at baseline and after the 5 th month of treatment .
After the infusion , blood samples were taken until day 28 ( for patients on a 21 day schedule , the interval was extended to 4 weeks for the pharmacokinetic study ) .

In particular , high concentrations of lgG and hypermetabolism associated with fever and infection have been seen to coincide with a shortened half - life of IgG .
Longer half - lives are often seen with immunodeficient patients [ 12 ] .
NON - CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No studies were conducted on carcinogenesis , mutagenesis , or impairment of fertililty with Octagam 5 % liquid .
Repeated - dose toxicity studies and the genotoxic studies gave no evidence of carcinogenic properties of TNBP and Octoxynol [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
The results of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies for TNBP and Octoxynol were negative .
The results of studies on the embryotoxic and teratogenic properties of TNBP and Octoxynol in rats and rabbits at a wide range of i . v . doses were also negative .
Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology No studies were conducted on non - clinical pharmacology , toxicology , local tolerance or pharmacokinetics with Octagam 5 % liquid .
A variety of single - dose toxicity studies were performed for TNBP and Octoxynol alone or in combination .
The lowest toxic dose of TNBP + Octoxynol ( 1 + 5 ) was 10 , 000 mcg / kg BM in rats after intravenous administration .
Studies on 13 - week toxicity were performed for combinations of TNBP + Octoxynol in a broad dose range intravenously in dogs and rats .
In these studies the lowest toxic dose for rats was local 60 mcg TNBP / kg + 300 mcg Octoxynol / kg BM i . v . ( concentration : 0 . 0006 % and 0 . 003 % , respectively ) and systemic 300 mcg TNBP / kg + 1 , 500 mcg Octoxynol / kg BM i . v . ( concentration : 0 . 003 % and 0 . 015 % , respectively ) .
The lowest toxic dose for dogs was local 50 mcg TNBP / kg + 250 mcg Octoxynol / kg BM i . v . ( concentration : 0 . 005 % and 0 . 025 % , respectively ) and systemic 500 mcg TNBP / kg + 2 , 500 mcg Octoxynol / kg BM i . v . ( concentration : 0 . 05 % and 0 . 25 % , respectively ) .
Local tolerance of TNBP and Octoxynol was evaluated from the experiments on repeat - dose toxicity ( rats , dogs ) and on developmental toxicity ( rats , rabbits ) .
In these animal studies the lowest dose exerting local adverse reactions was 50 + 250 mcg / kg BM ( TNBP + Octoxynol ; daily injections ) in dogs .
At this dose 4 out of 6 dogs were affected starting in week 7 of treatment .
A pharmacokinetic study was carried out in rats given 300 mcg of TNBP / kg and 1 , 500 mcg Octoxynol / kg BM i . v .
The plasma half - life for TNBP was approximately 20 minutes .
Octoxynol was not detected .
CLINICAL STUDIES In an open - label , multicenter study , 46 patients ( including 10 patients between the ages of 6 and 12 , and one 15 years old ) with primary humoral immunodeficiency ( PI ) received Octagam 5 % liquid individualized doses of 300 - 600 mg / kg every 3 or 4 weeks for 12 months .
