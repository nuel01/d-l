WARNING : POSTTREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATIONS OF HEPATITIS B Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are co - infected with hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV - 1 ) and have discontinued lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate .
Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow - up for at least several months in patients who discontinue TEMIXYS and are co - infected with HIV - 1 and HBV .
If appropriate , initiation of anti - hepatitis B therapy may be warranted [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
WARNING : POSTTREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATIONS OF HEPATITIS B See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning .
Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are co - infected with hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) and human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV - 1 ) and have discontinued lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate .
Monitor hepatic function closely in these patients and , if appropriate , initiate anti - hepatitis B treatment .
( 5 . 1 ) Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 , 5 . 2 , 5 . 4 , 5 . 6 ) 10 / 2019 Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) 10 / 2019 Early Virologic Failure Removed 10 / 2019 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE TEMIXYS is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) infection in adult and pediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg .
TEMIXYS , a combination of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ) , is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV - 1 infection in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg .
( 1 ) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • Testing : Prior to initiation and during treatment with TEMIXYS , patients should be tested for hepatitis B virus infection and HIV - 1 infection .
Prior to initiation and during use of TEMIXYS , on a clinically appropriate schedule , assess serum creatinine , estimated creatinine clearance , urine glucose , and urine protein in all patients .
In patients with chronic kidney disease , also assess serum phosphorus .
( 2 . 1 ) • Recommended dose in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg : One tablet once daily with or without food .
( 2 . 2 ) • Renal impairment : Not recommended in patients with estimated creatinine clearance less than 50 mL / min or patients with end - stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis .
( 2 . 3 ) 2 . 1 Testing Prior to Initiation and During Treatment with TEMIXYS Prior to initiation treatment with TEMIXYS , test patients for hepatitis B virus infection [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
Prior to initiation and during use of TEMIXYS , on a clinically appropriate schedule , assess serum creatinine , estimated creatinine clearance , urine glucose and urine protein in all patients .
In patients with chronic kidney disease , also assess serum phosphorus [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
2 . 2 Recommended Dose for Adult and Pediatric Patients Weighing at Least 35 kg TEMIXYS is a two - drug fixed - dose combination product containing 300 mg of lamivudine ( 3 TC ) and 300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) .
The recommended dosage of TEMIXYS in HIV - 1 infected adult and pediatric patients weighing at least 35 kg is one tablet taken orally once daily with or without food .
2 . 3 Not Recommended in Renal Impairment Because TEMIXYS is a fixed - dose combination formulation and cannot be dose adjusted , it is not recommended for patients with impaired renal function ( creatinine clearance less than 50 mL / min ) or patients with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) requiring hemodialysis [ see Use in Specific Population ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS TEMIXYS contains 300 mg of lamivudine and 300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate .
The tablets are white , oblong shape , film - coated tablets debossed with “ C 0 ” on one side and plain on the other side .
• Tablet : 300 mg lamivudine and 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( 3 ) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS TEMIXYS is contraindicated in patients with a previous hypersensitivity reaction to any of the components contained in the formulation .
• TEMIXYS is contraindicated in patients with previous hypersensitivity to any of the components of this product .
( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Co - infected HIV - 1 / HBV Patients : Emergence of lamivudine - resistant HBV variants associated with lamivudine - containing antiretroviral regimens has been reported .
( 5 . 1 ) • New onset or worsening renal impairment : Can include acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome .
Avoid administering TEMIXYS with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs .
( 5 . 2 ) • Immune reconstitution syndrome : Observed in HIV - infected patients .
May necessitate further evaluation and treatment ( 5 . 3 ) • Decreases in bone mineral density ( BMD ) : Consider assessment of BMD in patients with a history of pathologic fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss .
( 5 . 4 ) • Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis : Discontinue treatment in patients who develop symptoms or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity .
( 5 . 5 ) • Hepatic decompensation , some fatal , has occurred in HIV - 1 / HCV co - infected patients receiving interferon and ribavirin - based regimens .
Monitor for treatment - associated toxicities .
Discontinue TEMIXYS as medically appropriate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa , ribavirin , or both .
( 5 . 7 ) • Pancreatitis : Use with caution in pediatric patients with a history of pancreatitis or other significant risk factors for pancreatitis .
Discontinue treatment as clinically appropriate .
( 5 . 8 ) 5 . 1 Severe Acute Exacerbation of Hepatitis B in Patients Coinfected with HIV - 1 and HBV All patients with HIV - 1 should be tested for the presence of chronic hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) before initiating antiretroviral therapy .
Posttreatment Exacerbations of Hepatitis : Discontinuation of anti - HBV therapy , including 3 TC and TDF may be associated with severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis .
Patients infected with HBV who discontinue TEMIXYS should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow - up for at least several months after stopping treatment .
If appropriate , resumption of anti - hepatitis B therapy may be warranted , especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis , since posttreatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure .
If treatment with EPIVIR - HBV , TDF or a tenofovir alafenamide ( TAF ) - containing product is prescribed for chronic hepatitis B for a patient with unrecognized or untreated HIV - 1 infection , rapid emergence of HIV - 1 resistance is likely to result because of the subtherapeutic dose and the inappropriateness of monotherapy HIV - 1 treatment .
5 . 2 New Onset or Worsening Renal Impairment TDF , a component of TEMIXYS , is principally eliminated by the kidney .
Renal impairment , including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome ( renal tubular injury with severe hypophosphatemia ) , has been reported with the use of TDF [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Prior to initiation and during use of TEMIXYS , on a clinically appropriate schedule , assess serum creatinine , estimated creatinine clearance , urine glucose , and urine protein in all patients .
In patients with chronic kidney disease , also assess serum phosphorus .
Avoid TEMIXYS with concurrent or recent use of a nephrotoxic agent ( e . g . , high - dose or multiple non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs [ NSAIDs ] ) [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) ] .
Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high - dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in HIV - infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate .
Some patients required hospitalization and renal replacement therapy .
Alternatives to NSAIDs should be considered , if needed , in patients at risk for renal dysfunction .
Persistent or worsening bone pain , pain in extremities , fractures and / or muscular pain or weakness may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal function in patients at risk of renal dysfunction .
5 . 3 Immune Reconstitution Syndrome Immune reconstitution syndrome has been reported in HIV - infected patients treated with combination antiretroviral therapy , including 3 TC and TDF .
During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment , HIV - 1 infected patients whose immune system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic infections ( such as Mycobacterium avium infection , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia [ PCP ] , or tuberculosis ) , which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment .
Autoimmune disorders ( such as Graves ’ disease , polymyositis , and Guillain - Barré syndrome ) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reconstitution ; however , the time to onset is more variable , and can occur many months after initiation of treatment .
5 . 4 Bone Loss and Mineralization Defects Bone Mineral Density ( BMD ) : In clinical trials in HIV - 1 infected adults , TDF was associated with greater decreases in BMD and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism , suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators .
Serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1 , 25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving TDF [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
Clinical trials evaluating TDF - containing regimens in pediatric subjects were conducted .
Under normal circumstances , BMD increases rapidly in pediatric patients .
In HIV - 1 infected pediatric subjects less than 18 years of age , bone effects were similar to those observed in adult subjects and suggest increased bone turnover .
Total body BMD gain was less in the TDF - treated HIV - 1 infected pediatric subjects as compared to the control groups .
In all pediatric trials , normal skeletal growth ( height ) was not affected for the duration of the clinical trials .
The effects of TDF - associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long - term bone health and future fracture risk are unknown .
The long - term effect of lower spine and total body BMD on skeletal growth in pediatric patients , and in particular , the effects of long - duration exposure in younger children is unknown .
Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D was not studied , such supplementation may be beneficial .
Assessment of BMD should be considered for adults and pediatric patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for osteoporosis or bone loss .
If bone abnormalities are suspected , appropriate consultation should be obtained .
Mineralization Defects : Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy , manifested as bone pain or pain in extremities and which may contribute to fractures , have been reported in association with the use of TDF [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Arthralgia and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of proximal renal tubulopathy .
Hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving TDF - containing products [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
5 . 5 Lactic Acidosis and Severe Hepatomegaly with Steatosis Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis , including fatal cases , have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals .
Treatment with TEMIXYS should be suspended in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity ( which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked transaminase elevations ) .
5 . 6 Risk of Adverse Reactions Due to Drug Interactions The concomitant use of TEMIXYS and other drugs may result in known or potentially significant drug interactions , some of which may lead to possible clinically significant adverse reactions from greater exposures of concomitant drugs [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
See Table 3 for steps to prevent or manage these possible and known significant drug interactions , including dosing recommendations .
Consider the potential for drug interactions prior to and during therapy with TEMIXYS ; review concomitant medications during therapy with TEMIXYS ; and monitor for adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drugs .
5 . 7 Risk of Hepatic Decompensation When Used with Interferon - and Ribavirin - Based Regimens In vitro studies have shown ribavirin can reduce the phosphorylation of pyrimidine nucleoside analogues such as 3 TC , a component of TEMIXYS .
Although no evidence of a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction ( e . g . , loss of HIV - 1 / HCV virologic suppression ) was seen when ribavirin was coadministered with 3 TC in HIV - 1 / HCV co - infected patients [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] , hepatic decompensation ( some fatal ) has occurred in HIV - 1 / HCV co - infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV - 1 and interferon alfa with or without ribavirin .
Patients receiving interferon alfa with or without ribavirin and 3 TC should be closely monitored for treatment - associated toxicities , especially hepatic decompensation .
Discontinuation of 3 TC should be considered as medically appropriate .
Dose reduction or discontinuation of interferon alfa , ribavirin , or both should also be considered if worsening clinical toxicities are observed , including hepatic decompensation ( e . g . , Child - Pugh greater than 6 ) .
See the full prescribing information for interferon and ribavirin .
5 . 8 Pancreatitis In pediatric patients with a history of prior antiretroviral nucleoside exposure , a history of pancreatitis , or other significant risk factors for the development of pancreatitis , 3 TC , a component of TEMIXYS , should be used with caution .
Treatment with TEMIXYS should be stopped immediately if clinical signs , symptoms , or laboratory abnormalities suggestive of pancreatitis occur [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 1 ) ] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions ( incidence greater than 10 % , with lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ) were headache , pain , depression , diarrhea , and rash .

Lamivudine and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate Clinical Trials in Treatment - Naïve HIV - 1 Infected Adult Subjects In Trial 903 , 600 antiretroviral - naïve subjects received TDF ( N = 299 ) or stavudine ( d4T ) ( N = 301 ) administered in combination with lamivudine ( 3 TC ) and efavirenz ( EFV ) for 144 weeks .
The most common adverse reactions were mild to moderate gastrointestinal events and dizziness .
Mild adverse reactions ( Grade 1 ) were common with a similar incidence in both arms , and included dizziness , diarrhea , and nausea .
Table 1 provides the treatment - emergent adverse reactions ( Grade 2 - 4 ) occurring in greater than or equal to 5 % of subjects treated in any treatment group .

d Peripheral neuropathy includes peripheral neuritis and neuropathy .
Laboratory Abnormalities : Table 2 provides a list of laboratory abnormalities ( Grades 3 - 4 ) observed in Trial 903 .
With the exception of fasting cholesterol and fasting triglyceride elevations that were more common in the d4T group ( 40 % and 9 % ) compared with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate group ( 19 % and 1 % ) , respectively , laboratory abnormalities observed in this trial occurred with similar frequency in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and d4T treatment arms .
Table 2 : Grades 3 - 4 Laboratory Abnormalities Reported in ≥ 1 % of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate - treated subjects in Trial 903 ( 0 - 144 Weeks ) TDF + 3 TC + EFV d4T + 3 TC + EFV N = 299 N = 301 Any ≥ Grade 3 Laboratory Abnormality 36 % 42 % Fasting Cholesterol ( > 240 mg / dL ) 19 % 40 % Creatine Kinase ( M : > 990 U / L ; F : > 845 U / L ) 12 % 12 % Serum Amylase ( > 175 U / L ) 9 % 8 % AST ( M : > 180 U / L ; F : > 170 U / L ) 5 % 7 % ALT ( M : > 215 U / L ; F : > 170 U / L ) 4 % 5 % Hematuria ( > 100 RBC / HPF ) 7 % 7 % Neutrophils ( < 750 / mm3 ) 3 % 1 % Fasting Triglycerides ( > 750 mg / dL ) 1 % 9 % Pancreatitis : Pancreatitis , which has been fatal in some cases , has been observed in antiretroviral nucleoside - experiences pediatric subjects receiving 3 TC alone or in combination with other antiretroviral agents [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 8 ) ] .
Changes in Bone Mineral Density In HIV - 1 infected adult subjects in Trial 903 , there was a significantly greater mean percentage decrease from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine in subjects receiving TDF + 3 TC + EFV ( − 2 . 2 % ± 3 . 9 ) compared with subjects receiving d4T + 3 TC + EFV ( − 1 . 0 % ± 4 . 6 ) through 144 weeks .
Changes in BMD at the hip were similar between the two treatment groups ( − 2 . 8 % ± 3 . 5 in the TDF group vs . − 2 . 4 % ± 4 . 5 in the d4T group ) .
In both groups , the majority of the reduction in BMD occurred in the first 24 - 48 weeks of the trial and this reduction was sustained through Week 144 .
Twenty - eight percent of TDF - treated subjects vs . 21 % of the d4T - treated subjects lost at least 5 % of BMD at the spine or 7 % of BMD at the hip .
Clinically relevant fractures ( excluding fingers and toes ) were reported in 4 subjects in the TDF group and 6 subjects in the d4T group .
In addition , there were significant increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism ( serum bone - specific alkaline phosphatase , serum osteocalcin , serum C telopeptide , and urinary N telopeptide ) and higher serum parathyroid hormone levels and 1 , 25 Vitamin D levels in the TDF group relative to the d4T group ; however , except for bone - specific alkaline phosphatase , these changes resulted in values that remained within the normal range [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use for each of the individual components of TEMIXYS .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate increases didanosine concentrations .
Dose reduction and close monitoring for didanosine toxicity are warranted .
( 7 . 2 ) • Coadministration decreases atazanavir concentration .
When coadministered with TEMIXYS , use atazanavir given with ritonavir .
( 7 . 2 ) • Coadministration of TEMIXYS with certain HIV - 1 protease inhibitors or certain drugs to treat HCV increases tenofovir concentrations .
Monitor for evidence of tenofovir toxicity .
( 7 . 2 ) • Sorbitol : Avoid chronic administration of sorbitol with TEMIXYS .
( 7 . 4 ) • Consult Full Prescribing Information prior to and during treatment for important drug interactions .
( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1 Drugs Affecting Renal Function Tenofovir , a component of TEMIXYS , is primarily eliminated by the kidneys [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Coadministration of TEMIXYS with drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of tenofovir and / or coadministered drug .
Some examples include , but are not limited to , acyclovir , cidofovir , ganciclovir , valacyclovir , valganciclovir , aminoglycosides ( e . g . , gentamicin ) , and high - dose or multiple NSAIDs [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
Drugs that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of tenofovir .
Do not administer TEMIXYS with HEPSERA ( adefovir dipivoxil ) .
7 . 2 Established and Significant Interactions Table 3 provides a listing of established or clinically significant drug interactions .
The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with TDF [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Table 3 : Established and Significanta Drug Interactions : Alteration in Dose or Regimen May Be Recommended Based on Drug Interaction Trials Concomitant Drug Class : Drug Name Effect on Concentrationb Clinical Comment NRTI : didanosine ↑ didanosine Patients receiving TDF , a component of TEMIXYS , and didanosine should be monitored closely for didanosine - associated adverse reactions .
Discontinue didanosine in patients who develop didanosine - associated adverse reactions .
Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosine - associated adverse reactions , including pancreatitis , and neuropathy .
Suppression of CD4 + cell counts has been observed in patients receiving TDF with didanosine 400 mg daily .
In patients weighing greater than 60 kg , reduce the didanosine dose to 250 mg when it is coadministered with TDF .
In patients weighing less than 60 kg , reduce the didanosine dose to 200 mg when it is coadministered with TDF .
When coadministered , tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and Videx ® - EC may be taken under fasted conditions or with a light meal ( less than 400 kcal , 20 % fat ) .
HIV - 1 Protease Inhibitors : Atazanavir ↓ atazanavir When coadministered with TEMIXYS , atazanavir 300 mg should be given with ritonavir 100 mg .
lopinavir / ritonavir atazanavir / ritonavir darunavir / ritonavir ↑ tenofovir Monitor patients receiving TEMIXYS concomitantly with lopinavir / ritonavir , ritonavir - boosted atazanavir , or ritonavir - boosted darunavir for TDF - associated adverse reactions .
Discontinue TEMIXYS in patients who develop TDF - associated adverse reactions .
Hepatitis C Antiviral Agents : sofosbuvir / velpatasvir sofosbuvir / velpatasvir / voxilaprevir ↑ tenofovir Monitor patients receiving TEMIXYS concomitantly with EPCLUSA ® ( sofosbuvir / velpatasvir ) for adverse reactions associated with TDF .
ledipasvir / sofosbuvir Monitor patients receiving TEMIXYS concomitantly with HARVONI ® ( ledipasvir / sofosbuvir ) without an HIV - 1 protease inhibitor / ritonavir or an HIV - 1 protease inhibitor / cobicistat combination for adverse reactions associated with TDF .
In patients receiving TEMIXYS concomitantly with HARVONI ® and an HIV - 1 protease inhibitor / ritonavir or an HIV - 1 protease inhibitor / cobicistat combination , consider an alternative HCV or antiretroviral therapy , as the safety of increased tenofovir concentrations in this setting has not been established .
If coadministration is necessary , monitor for adverse reactions associated with TDF .
a .
This table is not all inclusive .
b . ↑ = Increase , ↓ = Decrease 7 . 3 Drug Inhibiting Organic Cation Transporters 3 TC , a component of TEMIXYS , is predominantly eliminated in the urine by active organic cationic secretion .
The possibility of interactions with other drugs administered concurrently should be considered , particularly when their main route of elimination is active renal secretion via the organic cationic transport system ( e . g . , trimethoprim ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No data are available regarding interactions with other drugs that have renal clearance mechanisms similar to that of 3 TC .
7 . 4 Sorbitol Coadministration of single doses of lamivudine and sorbitol resulted in a sorbitol dose - dependent reduction in lamivudine exposures .
When possible , avoid use of sorbitol - containing medicines with lamivudine [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Breastfeeding not recommended due to potential for HIV transmission .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to TEMIXYS during pregnancy .
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry ( APR ) at 1 - 800 - 258 - 4263 .
Risk Summary Lamivudine : Available data from the APR show no difference in the risk of overall major birth defects for 3 TC compared to the background rate for major birth defects of 2 . 7 % in U . S . reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program ( MACDP ) ( see Data ) .
3 TC produced embryonic toxicity in rabbits at a dose the produced similar human exposures as the recommended clinical dose .
The relevance of animal findings to human pregnancy registry data is not known .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate : Available data from the APR show no increase in the overall risk of major birth defects with first trimester exposure for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) ( 2 . 1 % ) compared with the background rate for major birth defects of 2 . 7 % in a U . S . reference population of the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program ( MACDP ) ( see Data ) .
The rate of miscarriage for individual drugs is not reported in the APR .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 15 – 20 % .
In animal reproduction studies , no adverse developmental effects were observed when TDF was administered at doses / exposures ≥ 14 ( TDF ) and 2 . 7 ( tenofovir ) times those of the recommended daily dose of TDF ( see Data ) .
Data Human Data Lamivudine : Based on prospective reports from the APR of over 11 , 000 exposures to 3 TC during pregnancy resulting in live births ( including over 4 , 500 exposed in the first trimester ) , there was no difference between lamivudine and overall birth defects compared with the background birth defect rate of 2 . 7 % in the U . S . reference population of the MACDP .
The prevalence of defects in the first trimester was 3 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 2 . 6 % to 3 . 6 % ) .
3 TC pharmacokinetics were studied in pregnant women during 2 clinical trials conducted in South Africa .
The trials assessed pharmacokinetics in 16 women at 36 weeks gestation using 150 mg 3 TC twice daily with zidovudine , 10 women at 38 weeks gestation using 150 mg lamivudine twice daily with zidovudine , and 10 women at 38 weeks gestation using 3 TC 300 mg twice daily without other antiretrovirals .
These trials were not designed or powered to provide efficacy information .
3 TC pharmacokinetics in pregnant women were similar to those seen in non - pregnant adults and in postpartum women .
3 TC concentrations were generally similar in maternal , neonatal , and umbilical cord serum samples .
In a subset of subjects , amniotic fluid specimens were collected following natural rupture of membranes and confirmed that 3 TC crosses the placenta in humans .
Amniotic fluid concentrations of 3 TC were typically 2 times greater than maternal serum levels and ranged from 1 . 2 to 2 . 5 mcg per mL ( 150 mg twice daily ) and 2 . 1 to 5 . 2 mcg per mL ( 300 mg twice daily ) .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate : Based on prospective reports from the APR exposures to TDF - containing regimens during pregnancy resulting in live births ( including 3 , 342 exposed in the first trimester and 1 , 475 exposed in the second / third trimester ) , there was no increase in overall major birth defects with TDF compared with the background birth defect rate of 2 . 7 % in a U . S . reference population of the MACDP .
The prevalence of major birth defects in live births was 2 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 8 % to 2 . 8 % ) with first trimester exposure to TDF - containing regimens , and 2 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 4 % to 3 . 0 % ) with the second / third trimester exposure to TDF - containing regimens .
Prospective reports from the APR of overall major birth defects in pregnancies exposed to TDF are compared with a U . S . background major birth defect rate .
Methodological limitations of the APR include the use of MACDP as the external comparator group .
Limitations of using an external comparator include differences in methodology and populations , as well as confounding due to the underlying disease .
Animal Data Lamivudine : Studies in pregnant rats showed that 3 TC is transferred to the fetus through the placenta .
Reproduction studies with orally administered 3 TC have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses producing plasma levels up to approximately 35 times that for the recommended adult HIV dose .
No evidence of teratogenicity due to 3 TC was observed .
Evidence of early embryo - lethality was seen in the rabbit at exposure levels similar to those observed in humans , but there was no indication of this effect in the rat at exposure levels up to 35 times those in humans .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate : TDF was administered orally to pregnant rats ( at 0 , 50 , 150 , or 450 mg / kg / day ) and rabbits ( at 0 , 30 , 100 , or 300 mg / kg / day ) through organogenesis ( on gestation days 7 through 17 , and 6 through 18 , respectively ) .
No significant toxicological effects were observed in embryo - fetal toxicity studies performed with TDF in rats at doses up to 14 times the human dose based on body surface area comparisons and in rabbits at doses up to 19 times the human dose based on body surface area comparisons .
In a pre / postnatal development study in rats , TDF was administered orally through lactation at doses up to 600 mg / kg / day ; no adverse effects were observed in the offspring at tenofovir exposures of approximately 2 . 7 times higher than human exposures at the recommended daily dose of TDF .
8 . 2 Lactation The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV - 1 infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV - 1 infection .
Because of the potential for 1 ) HIV transmission ( in HIV - negative infants ) ; 2 ) developing viral resistance ( in HIV - positive infants ) ; and 3 ) adverse reactions in a breastfed infant similar to those seen in adults , instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving TEMIXYS .
Lamivudine : 3 TC is excreted into human milk .
Samples of breast milk obtained from 20 mothers receiving 3 TC monotherapy 300 mg twice daily ( 2 times the dose in TEMIXYS ) had measurable concentrations of 3 TC .
There is not information on the effects of 3 TC on the breastfed infant or the effects of 3 TC on milk production .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate : Based on published data , tenofovir has been shown to be present in human breast milk .
It is not known if tenofovir affects milk production or has effects on the breastfed child .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of TEMIXYS as a fixed dose formulation in pediatric patients infected with HIV - 1 and weighing at least 35 kg have been established based on clinical studies using the individual components ( lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ) .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
In general , caution should be exercised in administration of TEMIXYS in elderly patients reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment TEMIXYS is not recommended for patients with impaired renal function ( i . e . , creatinine clearance less than 50 mL / min ) or patients with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) requiring hemodialysis because it is a fixed - dose combination formulation that cannot be adjusted [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE If overdose occurs , the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity , and standard supportive treatment applied as necessary .
Lamivudine : There is no known specific treatment for overdose with 3 TC .
If overdose occurs , the patient should be monitored and standard supportive treatment applied as required .
Because a negligible amount of 3 TC was removed via ( 4 - hour ) hemodialysis , continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis , and automated peritoneal dialysis , it is not known if continuous hemodialysis would provide clinical benefit in a 3 TC overdose event .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate : Limited clinical experience at doses higher than the therapeutic dose of TDF is available .
Tenofovir is efficiently removed by hemodialysis with an extraction coefficient of approximately 54 % .
Following a single 300 mg dose of TDF , a 4 - hour hemodialysis session removed approximately 10 % of the administered tenofovir dose .
11 DESCRIPTION TEMIXYS is for oral administration .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action TEMIXYS is fixed dose combination of antiviral drugs , 3 TC , 300 mg and TDF , 300 mg with antiviral activity against HIV - 1 [ see Microbiology ( 12 . 4 ) ] 12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Lamivudine : After oral administration of 2 mg / kg of 3 TC twice a day to 9 adults with HIV - 1 , the peak serum 3 TC concentration ( Cmax ) was 1 . 5 ± 0 . 5 mcg / mL ( mean ± SD ) .
The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve ( AUC ) and Cmax increased in proportion to oral dose over the range from 0 . 25 to 10 mg / kg and absolute bioavailability in 12 adult patients was 86 % ± 16 % ( mean ± SD ) for the 150 - mg tablet and 87 % ± 13 % for the oral solution .
Binding of 3 TC to human plasma proteins is low ( < 36 % ) .
Within 12 hours after a single oral dose of 3 TC in 6 HIV - 1 - infected adults , 5 . 2 % ± 1 . 4 % ( mean ± SD ) of the dose was excreted as the trans - sulfoxide metabolite in the urine .
The majority of 3 TC is eliminated unchanged in urine by active organic cationic secretion and the observed mean elimination half - life ( t1 / 2 ) ranged from 5 to 7 hours in most single - dose studies with serum sampling for 24 hours after dosing .
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate : Following oral administration of a single 300 mg dose of TDF to HIV - 1 infected subjects in the fasted state , maximum serum concentrations ( Cmax ) were achieved in 1 . 0 ± 0 . 4 hrs ( mean ± SD ) and Cmax and AUC values were 296 ± 90 ng / mL and 2287 ± 685 ng • hr / mL , respectively .
The oral bioavailability of tenofovir from TDF in fasted subjects is approximately 25 % .
Less than 0 . 7 % of tenofovir binds to human plasma proteins in vitro and the binding is independent of concentration over the range of 0 . 01 to 25 mcg / mL .
Approximately 70 to 80 % of the intravenous dose of tenofovir is recovered as unchanged drug in the urine .
Tenofovir is eliminated by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion with a renal clearance in adults with normal renal function of 243 ± 33 mL / min ( mean ± SD ) .
Following a single oral dose , the terminal elimination half - life of tenofovir is approximately 17 hours .
Specific Populations Geriatric Patients : The pharmacokinetics of lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate have not been studied in patients over 65 years of age .
Gender : There are no significant or clinically relevant gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine and tenofovir .
Race Lamivudine : There are no significant or clinically relevant racial differences in 3 TC pharmacokinetics .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate : There were insufficient numbers from racial and ethnic groups other than Caucasian to adequately determine potential pharmacokinetic differences among these populations .
Patients with Renal Impairment : [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Lamivudine : The pharmacokinetic of lamivudine are altered in subjects with impaired renal function ( Table 4 ) .

Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established in the presence of decompensated liver disease .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate : The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir following a 300 mg single dose of TDF have been studied in non - HIV infected subjects with moderate to severe ( Child - Pugh B to C ) hepatic impairment .
There were no substantial alterations in tenofovir pharmacokinetics in subjects with hepatic impairment compared with unimpaired subjects .
Assessment of Drug Interactions : [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ] Lamivudine Effect of Lamivudine on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Agents : Based on in vitro study results , 3 TC at therapeutic drug exposures is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates of the following transporters : organic anion transporter polypeptide 1B1 / 3 ( OATP1B1 / 3 ) , breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) , P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) , multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 ( MATE1 ) , MATE2 - K , organic cation transporter 1 ( OCT1 ) , OCT2 , or OCT3 .
Effect of Other Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of 3 TC : 3 TC is a substrate of MATE1 , MATE2 - K , and OCT2 in vitro .
Trimethoprim ( an inhibitor of these drug transporters ) has been shown to increase 3 TC plasma concentrations .
This interaction is not considered clinically significant as no dose adjustment of 3 TC is needed .
3 TC is a substrate of P - gp and BCRP ; however , considering its absolute bioavailability ( 87 % ) , it is unlikely that these transporters play a significant role in the absorption of 3 TC .
Therefore , coadministration of drugs that are inhibitors of these efflux transporters is unlikely to affect the disposition and elimination of 3 TC .
Interferon Alfa : There was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between 3 TC and interferon alfa in a trial of 19 healthy male subjects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
Ribavirin : In vitro data indicate ribavirin reduces phosphorylation of 3 TC , stavudine , and zidovudine .
However , no pharmacokinetic ( e . g . , plasma concentrations or intracellular triphosphorylated active metabolite concentrations ) or pharmacodynamic ( e . g . , loss of HIV - 1 / HCV virologic suppression ) interaction was observed when ribavirin and 3 TC ( n = 18 ) , stavudine ( n = 10 ) , or zidovudine ( n = 6 ) were coadministered as part of a multi - drug regimen to HIV - 1 / HCV co - infected subjects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 7 ) ] .
Sorbitol ( Excipient ) : 3 TC and sorbitol solutions were coadministered to 16 healthy adult subjects in an open - label , randomized - sequence , 4 - period , crossover trial .
Each subject received a single 300 - mg dose of 3 TC oral solution alone or coadministered with a single dose of 3 . 2 grams , 10 . 2 grams , or 13 . 4 grams of sorbitol in solution .
Coadministration of 3 TC with sorbitol resulted in dose - dependent decreases of 20 % , 39 % , and 44 % in the AUC ( 0 - 24 ) , 14 % , 32 % , and 36 % in the AUC ( ∞ ) , and 28 % , 52 % , and 55 % in the Cmax of 3 TC , respectively .
Trimethoprim / Sulfamethoxazole : 3 TC and TMP / SMX were coadministered to 14 HIV - 1 - positive subjects in a single - center , open - label , randomized , crossover trial .
Each subject received treatment with a single 300 - mg dose of 3 TC and TMP 160 mg / SMX 800 mg once a day for 5 days with concomitant administration of 3 TC 300 mg with the fifth dose in a crossover design .
Coadministration of TMP / SMX with 3 TC resulted in an increase of 43 % ± 23 % ( mean ± SD ) in lamivudine AUC ∞ , a decrease of 29 % ± 13 % in lamivudine oral clearance , and a decrease of 30 % ± 36 % in 3 TC renal clearance .
The pharmacokinetic properties of TMP and SMX were not altered by coadministration with 3 TC .
There is no information regarding the effect on 3 TC pharmacokinetics of higher doses of TMP / SMX such as those used in treat PCP .
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate : At concentrations substantially higher ( ~ 300 - fold ) than those observed in vivo , tenofovir did not inhibit in vitro CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 , CYP2C9 , or CYP2E1 .
However , a small ( 6 % ) but statistically significant reduction in metabolism of CYP1A substrate was observed .
Based on the results of in vitro experiments and the known elimination pathway of tenofovir , the potential for CYP - mediated interactions involving tenofovir with other medicinal products is low .
TDF has been evaluated in healthy volunteers in combination with other antiretroviral and potential concomitant drugs .
Tables 6 and 7 summarize pharmacokinetic effects of coadministered drug on tenofovir pharmacokinetics and effects of TDF on the pharmacokinetics of coadministered drug .
TDF is a substrate of P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) and breast cancer resistance protein ( BCRP ) transporters .
When TDF is coadministered with an inhibitor of these transporters , an increase in absorption may be observed .
No clinically significant drug interactions have been observed between TDF and efavirenz , methadone , nelfinavir , oral contraceptives , ribavirin , or sofosbuvir .

Intracellularly , 3 TC is phosphorylated to its active 5 ’ - triphosphate metabolite , lamivudine triphosphate ( 3 TC - TP ) .
The principal mode of action of 3 TC - TP is inhibition of HIV - 1 reverse transcriptase ( RT ) via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleotide analogue .
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate : TDF is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate diester analog of adenosine monophosphate .
TDF requires initial diester hydrolysis for conversion to tenofovir and subsequent phosphorylations by cellular enzymes to form tenofovir diphosphate ( TFV - DP ) .
Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV - 1 reverse transcriptase ( RT ) and HBV RT by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5 ’ - triphosphate and , after incorporation into DNA , by DNA chain termination .
Tenofovir diphosphate is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases α , β , and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ .
Antiviral Activity Lamivudine : The antiviral activity of 3 TC against HIV - 1 was assessed in a number of cell lines including monocytes and fresh human peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBMCs ) using standard susceptibility assays .
EC50 values were in the range of 3 to 15 , 000 nM .
( 1 μM = 0 . 23 mcg / mL ) .
The median EC50 values of 3 TC were 60 nM ( range : 20 to 70 nM ) , 35 nM ( range : 30 to 40 nM ) , 30 nM ( range : 20 to 90 nM ) , 20 nM ( range : 3 to 40 nM ) , 30 nM ( range : 1 to 60 nM ) , 30 nM ( range : 20 to 70 nM ) , 30 nM ( range : 3 to 70 nM ) , and 30 nM ( range : 20 to 90 nM ) against HIV - 1 clades A - G and group O viruses ( n = 3 except n = 2 for clade B ) respectively .
The EC50 values against HIV - 2 isolates ( n = 4 ) ranged from 3 to 120 nM in PBMCs .
3 TC was not antagonistic to all tested anti - HIV agents .
Ribavirin ( 50 microM ) used in the treatment of chronic HCV infection decreased the anti - HIV - 1 activity of 3 TC by 3 . 5 - fold in MT - 4 cells .
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate : The antiviral activity of tenofovir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV - 1 was assessed in lymphoblastoid cell lines , primary monocyte / macrophage cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes .
The EC50 ( 50 % effective concentration ) values for tenofovir were in the range of 0 . 04 μM to 8 . 5 μM .
Tenofovir displayed antiviral activity in cell culture against HIV - 1 clades A , B , C , D , E , F , G , and O ( EC50 values ranged from 0 . 5 μM to 2 . 2 μM ) and strain - specific activity against HIV - 2 ( EC50 values ranged from 1 . 6 μM to 5 . 5 μM ) .
Please see the full prescribing information for VIREAD ® for information regarding the inhibitory activity of TDF against HBV .
Resistance Lamivudine : 3 TC - resistant variants of HIV - 1 have been selected in cell culture .
Genotypic analysis showed that resistance was predominantly due to a methionine to valine or isoleucine ( M184V / I ) .
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate : HIV - 1 isolates with reduced susceptibility to tenofovir have been selected in cell culture .
These viruses expressed a K65R substitution in reverse transcriptase and showed a 2 - to 4 - fold reduction in susceptibility to tenofovir .
In addition , a K70E substitution in HIV - 1 reverse transcriptase has been selected by tenofovir and results in low - level reduced susceptibility to tenofovir .
K65R substitutions developed in some subjects failing a TDF regimen .
Cross - Resistance Lamivudine : Cross - resistance among certain reverse transcriptase inhibitors has been observed .
3 TC - resistant HIV - 1 isolate were cross - resistant in cell culture to didanosine ( ddI ) .
Cross - resistance is also expected with abacavir and emtricitabine as these select M184V substitutions .
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate : Cross resistance among certain reverse transcriptase inhibitors has been recognized .
The K65R and K70E substitutions selected by tenofovir are also selected in some HIV - 1 infected subjects treated with abacavir or didanosine .
HIV - 1 isolates with the K65R also showed reduced susceptibility to emtricitabine and 3 TC .
HIV - 1 isolates from subjects ( N = 20 ) whose HIV - 1 expressed a mean of 3 zidovudine - associated reverse transcriptase substitutions ( M41L , D67N , K70R , L210W , T215Y / F , or K219Q / E / N ) , showed a 3 . 1 - fold decrease in the susceptibility to tenofovir .
Subjects whose virus expressed an L74V substitution without zidovudine resistance associated substitutions ( N = 8 ) had reduced response to VIREAD ® .
Limited data are available for patients whose virus expressed a Y115F substitution ( N = 3 ) , Q151M substitution ( N = 2 ) , or T69 insertion ( N = 4 ) , all of whom had a reduced response .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Lamivudine : Long - term carcinogenicity studies with 3 TC in mice and rats showed no evidence of carcinogenic potential at exposures up to 10 times ( mice ) and 58 times ( rats ) the human exposures at the recommended dose of 300 mg .
3 TC was not mutagenic in a microbial mutagenicity assay , in an in vitro cell transformation assay , in a rat micronucleus test , in a rat bone marrow cytogenetic assay , and in assay for unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat liver .
3 TC showed no evidence of in vivo genotoxic activity in the rat at oral doses of up to 2000 mg per kg , producing plasma levels of 35 to 45 times those in humans at the recommended dose for HIV - 1 infection .
In a study of reproductive performance , 3 TC administered to rats at doses up to 4 , 000 mg per kg per day , producing plasma levels 47 to 70 times those in humans , revealed no evidence of impaired fertility and no effect on the survival , growth , and development to weaning of the offspring .
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate : Long - term oral carcinogenicity studies of TDF in mice and rats were carried out at exposures up to approximately 16 times ( mice ) and 5 times ( rats ) those observed in humans at the therapeutic dose for HIV - 1 infection .
At the high dose in female mice , liver adenomas were increased at exposures 16 times that in humans .
In rats , the study was negative for carcinogenic findings at exposures up to 5 times that observed in humans at the therapeutic dose .
TDF was mutagenic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and negative in an in vitro bacterial mutagenicity test ( Ames test ) .
In an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay , TDF was negative when administered to male mice .
There were no effects on fertility , mating performance or early embryonic development when TDF was administered to male rats at a dose equivalent to 10 times the human dose based on body surface area comparisons for 28 days prior to mating and to female rats for 15 days prior to mating through day seven of gestation .
There was , however , an alteration of the estrous cycle in female rats .
13 . 2 Animal Toxicology and / or Pharmacology Tenofovir and TDF administered in toxicology studies to rats , dogs , and monkeys at exposures ( based on AUCs ) greater than or equal to 6 fold those observed in humans caused bone toxicity .
In monkeys the bone toxicity was diagnosed as osteomalacia .
Osteomalacia observed in monkeys appeared to be reversible upon dose reduction or discontinuation of tenofovir .
In rats and dogs , the bone toxicity manifested as reduced bone mineral density .
The mechanism ( s ) underlying bone toxicity is unknown .
Evidence of renal toxicity was noted in 4 animal species .
Increases in serum creatinine , BUN , glycosuria , proteinuria , phosphaturia , and / or calciuria and decreases in serum phosphate were observed to varying degrees in these animals .
These toxicities were noted at exposures ( based on AUCs ) 2 − 20 times higher than those observed in humans .
The relationship of the renal abnormalities , particularly the phosphaturia , to the bone toxicity is not known .
