DESCRIPTION DITROPAN XL ® ( oxybutynin chloride ) is an antispasmodic , anticholinergic agent .
Each DITROPAN XL ® Extended Release Tablet contains 5 mg , 10 mg , or 15 mg of oxybutynin chloride USP , formulated as a once - a - day controlled - release tablet for oral administration .
Oxybutynin chloride is administered as a racemate of R - and S - enantiomers .
Chemically , oxybutynin chloride is d , l ( racemic ) 4 - diethylamino - 2 - butynyl phenylcyclohexylglycolate hydrochloride .
The empirical formula of oxybutynin chloride is C22H31NO3 • HCl .
Its structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Oxybutynin chloride is a white crystalline solid with a molecular weight of 393 . 9 .
It is readily soluble in water and acids , but relatively insoluble in alkalis .
DITROPAN XL ® also contains the following inert ingredients : cellulose acetate , hypromellose , lactose , magnesium stearate , polyethylene glycol , polyethylene oxide , synthetic iron oxides , titanium dioxide , polysorbate 80 , sodium chloride , and butylated hydroxytoluene .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] System Components and Performance DITROPAN XL ® uses osmotic pressure to deliver oxybutynin chloride at a controlled rate over approximately 24 hours .
The system , which resembles a conventional tablet in appearance , comprises an osmotically active bilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane .
The bilayer core is composed of a drug layer containing the drug and excipients , and a push layer containing osmotically active components .
There is a precision - laser drilled orifice in the semipermeable membrane on the drug - layer side of the tablet .
In an aqueous environment , such as the gastrointestinal tract , water permeates through the membrane into the tablet core , causing the drug to go into suspension and the push layer to expand .
This expansion pushes the suspended drug out through the orifice .
The semipermeable membrane controls the rate at which water permeates into the tablet core , which in turn controls the rate of drug delivery .
The controlled rate of drug delivery into the gastrointestinal lumen is thus independent of pH or gastrointestinal motility .
The function of DITROPAN XL ® depends on the existence of an osmotic gradient between the contents of the bilayer core and the fluid in the gastrointestinal tract .
Since the osmotic gradient remains constant , drug delivery remains essentially constant .
The biologically inert components of the tablet remain intact during gastrointestinal transit and are eliminated in the feces as an insoluble shell .
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Oxybutynin chloride exerts a direct antispasmodic effect on smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle .
Oxybutynin chloride exhibits only one - fifth of the anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit detrusor muscle , but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity .
No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia ( antinicotinic effects ) .
Oxybutynin chloride relaxes bladder smooth muscle .
In patients with conditions characterized by involuntary bladder contractions , cystometric studies have demonstrated that oxybutynin increases bladder ( vesical ) capacity , diminishes the frequency of uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle , and delays the initial desire to void .
Oxybutynin thus decreases urgency and the frequency of both incontinent episodes and voluntary urination .
Antimuscarinic activity resides predominantly in the R - isomer .
A metabolite , desethyloxybutynin , has pharmacological activity similar to that of oxybutynin in in vitro studies .
Pharmacokinetics Absorption Following the first dose of DITROPAN XL ® ( oxybutynin chloride ) , oxybutynin plasma concentrations rise for 4 to 6 hours ; thereafter steady concentrations are maintained for up to 24 hours , minimizing fluctuations between peak and trough concentrations associated with oxybutynin .
The relative bioavailabilities of R - and S - oxybutynin from DITROPAN XL ® are 156 % and 187 % , respectively , compared with oxybutynin .
The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for R - and S - oxybutynin are summarized in Table 1 .
The plasma concentration - time profiles for R - and S - oxybutynin are similar in shape ; Figure 1 shows the profile for R - oxybutynin .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] Steady state oxybutynin plasma concentrations are achieved by Day 3 of repeated DITROPAN XL ® dosing , with no observed drug accumulation or change in oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin pharmacokinetic parameters .
DITROPAN XL ® steady state pharmacokinetics were studied in 19 children aged 5 – 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition ( e . g . , spina bifida ) .
The children were on DITROPAN XL ® total daily dose ranging from 5 to 20 mg ( 0 . 10 to 0 . 77 mg / kg ) .
Sparse sampling technique was used to obtain serum samples .
When all available data are normalized to an equivalent of 5 mg per day DITROPAN XL ® , the mean pharmacokinetic parameters derived for R - and S - oxybutynin and R - and S - desethyloxybutynin are summarized in Table 2 .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Food Effects The rate and extent of absorption and metabolism of oxybutynin are similar under fed and fasted conditions .
Distribution Oxybutynin is widely distributed in body tissues following systemic absorption .
The volume of distribution is 193 L after intravenous administration of 5 mg oxybutynin chloride .
Both enantiomers of oxybutynin are highly bound ( > 99 % ) to plasma proteins .
Both enantiomers of N - desethyloxybutynin are also highly bound ( > 97 % ) to plasma proteins .
The major binding protein is alpha - 1 acid glycoprotein .
Metabolism Oxybutynin is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems , particularly CYP3A4 found mostly in the liver and gut wall .
Its metabolic products include phenylcyclohexylglycolic acid , which is pharmacologically inactive , and desethyloxybutynin , which is pharmacologically active .
Following DITROPAN XL ® administration , plasma concentrations of R - and S - desethyloxybutynin are 73 % and 92 % , respectively , of concentrations observed with oxybutynin .
Excretion Oxybutynin is extensively metabolized by the liver , with less than 0 . 1 % of the administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine .
Also , less than 0 . 1 % of the administered dose is excreted as the metabolite desethyloxybutynin .
Dose Proportionality Pharmacokinetic parameters of oxybutynin and desethyloxybutynin ( Cmax and AUC ) following administration of 5 – 20 mg of DITROPAN XL ® are dose proportional .
Special Populations Geriatric The pharmacokinetics of DITROPAN XL ® were similar in all patients studied ( up to 78 years of age ) .
Pediatric The pharmacokinetics of DITROPAN XL ® were evaluated in 19 children aged 5 – 15 years with detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition ( e . g . , spina bifida ) .
The pharmacokinetics of DITROPAN XL ® in these pediatric patients were consistent with those reported for adults ( see Tables 1 and 2 , and Figures 1 and 2 above ) .
Gender There are no significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of oxybutynin in healthy male and female volunteers following administration of DITROPAN XL ® .

Drug - Drug Interactions See PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions .
CLINICAL STUDIES DITROPAN XL ® ( oxybutynin chloride ) was evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence , urgency , and frequency in three controlled studies and one open - label study .
The majority of patients were Caucasian ( 89 . 0 % ) and female ( 91 . 9 % ) with a mean age of 59 years ( range , 18 to 98 years ) .
Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence ( with a predominance of urge ) as evidenced by ≥ 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and ≥ 10 micturitions per day .
Study 1 was a fixed - dose escalation design , whereas the other studies used a dose - adjustment design in which each patient ' s final dose was adjusted to a balance between improvement of incontinence symptoms and tolerability of side effects .
Controlled studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications , and these patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks .
The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are presented in the following tables and figures .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] INDICATIONS AND USAGE DITROPAN XL ® ( oxybutynin chloride ) is a once - daily controlled - release tablet indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence , urgency , and frequency .
DITROPAN XL ® is also indicated in the treatment of pediatric patients aged 6 years and older with symptoms of detrusor overactivity associated with a neurological condition ( e . g . , spina bifida ) .
CONTRAINDICATIONS DITROPAN XL ® ( oxybutynin chloride ) is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention , gastric retention and other severe decreased gastrointestinal motility conditions , uncontrolled narrow - angle glaucoma and in patients who are at risk for these conditions .
DITROPAN XL ® is also contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug substance or other components of the product .
WARNINGS Angioedema of the face , lips , tongue and / or larynx has been reported with oxybutynin .
In some cases , angioedema occurred after the first dose .
Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life - threatening .
If involvement of the tongue , hypopharynx , or larynx occurs , oxybutynin should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and / or measures necessary to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided .
PRECAUTIONS Central Nervous System Effects Oxybutynin is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system ( CNS ) effects ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) .
A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported , including hallucinations , agitation , confusion and somnolence .
Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects , particularly in the first few months after beginning treatment or increasing the dose .
If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects , dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered .
DITROPAN XL ® should be used with caution in patients with preexisting dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors due to the risk of aggravation of symptoms .
General DITROPAN XL ® ( oxybutynin chloride ) should be used with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment and in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of symptom aggravation .
Urinary Retention DITROPAN XL ® should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
Gastrointestinal Disorders DITROPAN XL ® should be administered with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention ( see CONTRAINDICATIONS ) .
DITROPAN XL ® , like other anticholinergic drugs , may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis and intestinal atony .
DITROPAN XL ® should be used with caution in patients who have gastroesophageal reflux and / or who are concurrently taking drugs ( such as bisphosphonates ) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis .
As with any other nondeformable material , caution should be used when administering DITROPAN XL ® to patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal narrowing ( pathologic or iatrogenic ) .
There have been rare reports of obstructive symptoms in patients with known strictures in association with the ingestion of other drugs in nondeformable controlled - release formulations .
Information for Patients Patients should be informed that oxybutynin may produce angioedema that could result in life - threatening airway obstruction .
Patients should be advised to promptly discontinue oxybutynin therapy and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the tongue , edema of the laryngopharynx , or difficulty breathing .
Patients should be informed that heat prostration ( fever and heat stroke due to decreased sweating ) can occur when anticholinergics such as oxybutynin chloride are administered in the presence of high environmental temperature .
Because anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin may produce drowsiness ( somnolence ) or blurred vision , patients should be advised to exercise caution .
Patients should be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by anticholinergic agents such as oxybutynin .
Patients should be informed that DITROPAN XL ® should be swallowed whole with the aid of liquids .
Patients should not chew , divide , or crush tablets .
The medication is contained within a nonabsorbable shell designed to release the drug at a controlled rate .
The tablet shell is eliminated from the body ; patients should not be concerned if they occasionally notice in their stool something that looks like a tablet .
DITROPAN XL ® should be taken at approximately the same time each day .
Drug Interactions The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth , constipation , somnolence ( drowsiness ) , and / or other anticholinergic - like effects may increase the frequency and / or severity of such effects .
Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility .
This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index .
Mean oxybutynin chloride plasma concentrations were approximately 2 fold higher when DITROPAN XL ® was administered with ketoconazole , a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor .
Other inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system , such as antimycotic agents ( e . g . , itraconazole and miconazole ) or macrolide antibiotics ( e . g . , erythromycin and clarithromycin ) , may alter oxybutynin mean pharmacokinetic parameters ( i . e . , Cmax and AUC ) .
The clinical relevance of such potential interactions is not known .
Caution should be used when such drugs are co - administered .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility A 24 - month study in rats at dosages of oxybutynin chloride of 20 , 80 , and 160 mg / kg / day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity .
These doses are approximately 6 , 25 , and 50 times the maximum human exposure , based on surface area .
Oxybutynin chloride showed no increase of mutagenic activity when tested in Schizosaccharomyces pompholiciformis , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and Salmonella typhimurium test systems .
Reproduction studies with oxybutynin chloride in the mouse , rat , hamster , and rabbit showed no definite evidence of impaired fertility .
Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies with oxybutynin chloride in the mouse , rat , hamster , and rabbit showed no definite evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the animal fetus .
The safety of DITROPAN XL ® administration to women who are or who may become pregnant has not been established .
Therefore , DITROPAN XL ® should not be given to pregnant women unless , in the judgment of the physician , the probable clinical benefits outweigh the possible hazards .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether oxybutynin is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when DITROPAN XL ® is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of DITROPAN XL ® were studied in 60 children in a 24 - week , open - label trial .
Patients were aged 6 – 15 years , all had symptoms of detrusor overactivity in association with a neurological condition ( e . g . , spina bifida ) , all used clean intermittent catheterization , and all were current users of oxybutynin chloride .
Study results demonstrated that administration of DITROPAN XL ® 5 to 20 mg / day was associated with an increase from baseline in mean urine volume per catheterization from 108 mL to 136 mL , an increase from baseline in mean urine volume after morning awakening from 148 mL to 189 mL , and an increase from baseline in the mean percentage of catheterizations without a leaking episode from 34 % to 51 % .
Urodynamic results were consistent with clinical results .
Administration of DITROPAN XL ® resulted in an increase from baseline in mean maximum cystometric capacity from 185 mL to 254 mL , a decrease from baseline in mean detrusor pressure at maximum cystometric capacity from 44 cm H2O to 33 cm H2O , and a reduction in the percentage of patients demonstrating uninhibited detrusor contractions ( of at least 15 cm H2O ) from 60 % to 28 % .
DITROPAN XL ® is not recommended in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole without chewing , dividing , or crushing , or in children under the age of 6 ( See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ) .
Geriatric Use The rate and severity of anticholinergic effects reported by patients less than 65 years old and those 65 years and older were similar ( see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY , Pharmacokinetics , Special Populations : Geriatric ) .
