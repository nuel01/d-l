1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE NESINA is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
NESINA is a dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 ( DPP - 4 ) inhibitor indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
( 1 . )
Limitations of Use : Should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes .
( 1 ) Limitations of Use NESINA should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus .
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION • The recommended dose in patients with normal renal function or mild renal impairment is 25 mg once daily .
( 2 . 1 ) • Can be taken with or without food .
( 2 . 1 ) • Adjust dose if moderate or severe renal impairment or end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) .
( 2 . 2 ) Degree of Renal Impairment Creatinine Clearance ( mL / min ) Recommended Dosing Moderate ≥ 30 to < 60 12 . 5 mg once daily Severe / ESRD < 30 6 . 25 mg once daily 2 . 1 Recommended Dosing The recommended dose of NESINA is 25 mg once daily .
NESINA may be taken with or without food Do not split tablets .
2 . 2 Patients with Renal Impairment No dose adjustment of NESINA is necessary for patients with mild renal impairment ( creatinine clearance [ CrCl ] ≥ 60 mL / min ) .
The dose of NESINA is 12 . 5 mg once daily for patients with moderate renal impairment ( CrCl ≥ 30 to < 60 mL / min ) .
The dose of NESINA is 6 . 25 mg once daily for patients with severe renal impairment ( CrCl ≥ 15 to < 30 mL / min ) or with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) ( CrCl < 15 mL / min or requiring hemodialysis ) .
NESINA may be administered without regard to the timing of dialysis .
NESINA has not been studied in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Because there is a need for dose adjustment based upon renal function , assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiation of NESINA therapy and periodically thereafter .

Reactions such as anaphylaxis , angioedema and severe cutaneous adverse reactions have been reported [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) , Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Serious hypersensitivity reaction to alogliptin or any of the excipients in NESINA ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Pancreatitis : There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis .
If pancreatitis is suspected , promptly discontinue NESINA .
( 5 . 1 ) • Heart failure : Consider the risks and benefits of NESINA prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure .
If heart failure develops , evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of NESINA ( 5 . 2 ) .
• Hypersensitivity : There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with NESINA such as anaphylaxis , angioedema and severe cutaneous adverse reactions , including Stevens - Johnson syndrome .
In such cases , promptly discontinue NESINA , assess for other potential causes , institute appropriate monitoring and treatment and initiate alternative treatment for diabetes .
( 5 . 3 ) • Hepatic effects : Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure , sometimes fatal .
Causality cannot be excluded .
If liver injury is detected , promptly interrupt NESINA and assess patient for probable cause , then treat cause if possible , to resolution or stabilization .
Do not restart NESINA if liver injury is confirmed and no alternative etiology can be found .
( 5 . 4 ) • Hypoglycemia : When an insulin secretagogue ( e . g . , sulfonylurea ) or insulin is used in combination with NESINA , a lower dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia .
( 5 . 5 ) • Arthralgia : Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP - 4 inhibitors .
Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate .
( 5 . 6 ) • Bullous pemphigoid : There have been postmarketing reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP - 4 inhibitors .
Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions .
If bullous pemphigoid is suspected , discontinue NESINA .
( 5 . 7 ) 5 . 1 Pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported in the postmarketing setting and in randomized clinical trials .
In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes , acute pancreatitis was reported in 6 ( 0 . 2 % ) patients treated with NESINA 25 mg and 2 ( < 0 . 1 % ) patients treated with active comparators or placebo .
In the EXAMINE trial ( a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular ( CV ) risk ) , acute pancreatitis was reported in 10 ( 0 . 4 % ) of patients treated with NESINA and in 7 ( 0 . 3 % ) of patients treated with placebo .
It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for pancreatitis while using NESINA .
After initiation of NESINA , patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis .
If pancreatitis is suspected , NESINA should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated .
5 . 2 Heart Failure In the EXAMINE trial which enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes and recent acute coronary syndrome , 106 ( 3 . 9 % ) of patients treated with NESINA and 89 ( 3 . 3 % ) of patients treated with placebo were hospitalized for congestive heart failure .
Consider the risks and benefits of NESINA prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure , such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment , and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy .
Patients should be advised of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and should be instructed to immediately report such symptoms .
If heart failure develops , evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of NESINA .
5 . 3 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with NESINA .
These reactions include anaphylaxis , angioedema and severe cutaneous adverse reactions , including Stevens - Johnson syndrome .
If a serious hypersensitivity reaction is suspected , discontinue NESINA , assess for other potential causes for the event and institute alternative treatment for diabetes [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
Use caution in patients with a history of angioedema with another dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 ( DPP - 4 ) inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with NESINA .
5 . 4 Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking NESINA , although some of the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes , serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) were reported in 1 . 3 % of patients treated with NESINA 25 mg and 1 . 7 % of patients treated with active comparators or placebo .
In the EXAMINE trial ( a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular ( CV ) risk ) , increases in serum alanine aminotransferase three times the upper limit of the reference range occurred in 2 . 4 % of patients treated with NESINA and in 1 . 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury , including fatigue , anorexia , right upper abdominal discomfort , dark urine or jaundice .
In this clinical context , if the patient is found to have clinically significant liver enzyme elevations and if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen , NESINA should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause .
NESINA should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities .
5 . 5 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues , such as sulfonylureas , are known to cause hypoglycemia .
Therefore , a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with NESINA .
5 . 6 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP - 4 inhibitors .
The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years .
Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication .
A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP - 4 inhibitor .
Consider DPP - 4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate .
5 . 7 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP - 4 inhibitor use .
In reported cases , patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP - 4 inhibitor .
Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving NESINA .
If bullous pemphigoid is suspected , NESINA should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment .

6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
A total of 14 , 778 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in 14 randomized , double - blind , controlled clinical trials of whom 9052 subjects were treated with NESINA , 3469 subjects were treated with placebo and 2257 were treated with an active comparator .
The mean duration of diabetes was seven years , the mean body mass index ( BMI ) was 31 kg / m2 ( 49 % of patients had a BMI ≥ 30 kg / m2 ) , and the mean age was 58 years ( 26 % of patients ≥ 65 years of age ) .
The mean exposure to NESINA was 49 weeks with 3348 subjects treated for more than one year .
In a pooled analysis of these 14 controlled clinical trials , the overall incidence of adverse reactions was 73 % in patients treated with NESINA 25 mg compared to 75 % with placebo and 70 % with active comparator .
Overall discontinuation of therapy due to adverse reactions was 6 . 8 % with NESINA 25 mg compared to 8 . 4 % with placebo or 6 . 2 % with active comparator .
Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 4 % of patients treated with NESINA 25 mg and more frequently than in patients who received placebo are summarized in Table 1 .

In the monotherapy study , the incidence of hypoglycemia was 1 . 5 % in patients treated with NESINA compared to 1 . 6 % with placebo .
The use of NESINA as add - on therapy to glyburide or insulin did not increase the incidence of hypoglycemia compared to placebo .
In a monotherapy study comparing NESINA to a sulfonylurea in elderly patients , the incidence of hypoglycemia was 5 . 4 % with NESINA compared to 26 % with glipizide ( Table 2 ) .

[ 2 ] Severe events of hypoglycemia were defined as those events requiring medical assistance or exhibiting depressed level or loss of consciousness or seizure .
In the EXAMINE trial , the incidence of investigator reported hypoglycemia was 6 . 7 % in patients receiving NESINA and 6 . 5 % in patients receiving placebo .
Serious adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were reported in 0 . 8 % of patients treated with NESINA and in 0 . 6 % of patients treated with placebo .
Renal Impairment In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes , 3 . 4 % of patients treated with NESINA and 1 . 3 % of patients treated with placebo had renal function adverse reactions .
The most commonly reported adverse reactions were renal impairment ( 0 . 5 % for NESINA and 0 . 1 % for active comparators or placebo ) , decreased creatinine clearance ( 1 . 6 % for NESINA and 0 . 5 % for active comparators or placebo ) and increased blood creatinine ( 0 . 5 % for NESINA and 0 . 3 % for active comparators or placebo ) [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
In the EXAMINE trial of high CV risk type 2 diabetes patients , 23 % of patients treated with NESINA and 21 % of patients treated with placebo had an investigator reported renal impairment adverse reaction .
The most commonly reported adverse reactions were renal impairment ( 7 . 7 % for NESINA and 6 . 7 % for placebo ) , decreased glomerular filtration rate ( 4 . 9 % for NESINA and 4 . 3 % for placebo ) and decreased renal clearance ( 2 . 2 % for NESINA and 1 . 8 % for placebo ) .
Laboratory measures of renal function were also assessed .
Estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased by 25 % or more in 21 . 1 % of patients treated with NESINA and 18 . 7 % of patients treated with placebo .
Worsening of chronic kidney disease stage was seen in 16 . 8 % of patients treated with NESINA and in 15 . 5 % of patients treated with placebo .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during the postmarketing use of NESINA .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Gastrointestinal disorders : acute pancreatitis , diarrhea , constipation , nausea , ileus Hepatobiliary disorders : fulminant hepatic failure Immune system disorders : hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis Investigations : hepatic enzyme elevations Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders : severe and disabling arthralgia , rhabdomyolysis Renal and urinary disorders : tubulointerstitial nephritis Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : angioedema , rash , urticaria and severe cutaneous adverse reactions including Stevens - Johnson syndrome , bullous pemphigoid 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS NESINA is primarily renally excreted .
Cytochrome ( CYP ) P450 - related metabolism is negligible .
No significant drug - drug interactions were observed with the CYP - substrates or inhibitors tested or with renally excreted drugs [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data with NESINA in pregnant women are not sufficient to determine a drug - associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage .
There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [ see Clinical Considerations ] .
No adverse developmental effects were observed when alogliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at exposures 180 - and 149 - times the 25 mg clinical dose , respectively , based on plasma drug exposure ( AUC ) [ see Data ] .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6 - 10 % in women with pre - gestational diabetes with a HbA1c > 7 and has been reported to be as high as 20 - 25 % in women with HbA1c > 10 .
The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 - 4 % and 15 - 20 % , respectively .
Clinical Considerations Disease - associated maternal and / or embryo / fetal risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis , pre - eclampsia , spontaneous abortions , preterm delivery , and delivery complications .
Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects , still birth , and macrosomia related morbidity .
Data Animal Data Alogliptin administered to pregnant rabbits and rats during the period of organogenesis did not cause adverse developmental effects at doses of up to 200 mg / kg and 500 mg / kg , or 149 times and 180 times , the 25 mg clinical dose , respectively , based on plasma drug exposure ( AUC ) .
Placental transfer of alogliptin into the fetus was observed following oral dosing to pregnant rats .
No adverse developmental outcomes were observed in offspring when alogliptin was administered to pregnant rats during gestation and lactation at doses up to 250 mg / kg ( ~ 95 times the 25 mg clinical dose , based on AUC ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of alogliptin in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production .
Alogliptin is present in rat milk : however , due to species specific differences in lactation physiology , animal lactation data may not reliably predict levels in human milk .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ' s clinical need for NESINA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from NESINA or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of NESINA in pediatric patients have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of patients ( N = 9052 ) in clinical safety and efficacy studies treated with NESINA , 2257 ( 24 . 9 % ) patients were 65 years and older and 386 ( 4 . 3 % ) patients were 75 years and older .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years and over and younger patients .
While this clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients , greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment A total of 602 patients with moderate renal impairment ( eGFR ≥ 30 and < 60 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) and 4 patients with severe renal impairment / end - stage renal disease ( eGFR < 30 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 or < 15 mL / min / 1 . 73 m2 , respectively ) at baseline were treated with NESINA in clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes .
Reductions in HbA1c were generally similar in this subgroup of patients .
The overall incidence of adverse reactions was generally balanced between NESINA and placebo treatments in this subgroup of patients .
In the EXAMINE trial of high CV risk type 2 diabetes patients , 694 patients had moderate renal impairment and 78 patients had severe renal impairment or end - stage renal disease at baseline .
The overall incidences of adverse reactions , serious adverse reactions and adverse reactions leading to study drug discontinuation were generally similar between the treatment groups .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustments are required in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Grade A and B ) based on insignificant change in systemic exposures ( e . g . , AUC ) compared to subjects with normal hepatic function in a pharmacokinetic study .
NESINA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Grade C ) .
Use caution when administering NESINA to patients with liver disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of an overdose , it is reasonable to institute the necessary clinical monitoring and supportive therapy as dictated by the patient ' s clinical status .
Per clinical judgment , it may be reasonable to initiate removal of unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract .
Alogliptin is minimally dialyzable ; over a three - hour hemodialysis session , approximately 7 % of the drug was removed .
Therefore , hemodialysis is unlikely to be beneficial in an overdose situation .
It is not known if NESINA is dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis .

11 DESCRIPTION NESINA tablets contain the active ingredient alogliptin , which is a selective , orally bioavailable inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 ( DPP - 4 ) .
Chemically , alogliptin is prepared as a benzoate salt , which is identified as 2 - ( { 6 - [ ( 3 R ) - 3 - aminopiperidin - 1 - yl ] - 3 - methyl - 2 , 4 - dioxo - 3 , 4 - dihydropyrimidin - 1 ( 2 H ) - yl } methyl ) benzonitrile monobenzoate .
It has a molecular formula of C18H21N5O2 • C7H6O2 and a molecular weight of 461 . 51 daltons .
The structural formula is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Alogliptin benzoate is a white to off - white crystalline powder containing one asymmetric carbon in the aminopiperidine moiety .
It is soluble in dimethylsulfoxide , sparingly soluble in water and methanol , slightly soluble in ethanol and very slightly soluble in octanol and isopropyl acetate .
Each NESINA tablet contains 34 mg , 17 mg or 8 . 5 mg alogliptin benzoate , which is equivalent to 25 mg , 12 . 5 mg or 6 . 25 mg , respectively , of alogliptin and the following inactive ingredients : mannitol , microcrystalline cellulose , hydroxypropyl cellulose , croscarmellose sodium and magnesium stearate .
In addition , the film coating contains the following inactive ingredients : hypromellose , titanium dioxide , ferric oxide ( red or yellow ) and polyethylene glycol , and is marked with printing ink ( Gray F1 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Increased concentrations of the incretin hormones such as glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( GLP - 1 ) and glucose - dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) are released into the bloodstream from the small intestine in response to meals .
These hormones cause insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells in a glucose - dependent manner but are inactivated by the dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 ( DPP - 4 ) enzyme within minutes .
GLP - 1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells , reducing hepatic glucose production .
In patients with type 2 diabetes , concentrations of GLP - 1 are reduced but the insulin response to GLP - 1 is preserved .
Alogliptin is a DPP - 4 inhibitor that slows the inactivation of the incretin hormones , thereby increasing their bloodstream concentrations and reducing fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations in a glucose - dependent manner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
Alogliptin selectively binds to and inhibits DPP - 4 but not DPP - 8 or DPP - 9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating therapeutic exposures .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Single - dose administration of NESINA to healthy subjects resulted in a peak inhibition of DPP - 4 within two to three hours after dosing .
The peak inhibition of DPP - 4 exceeded 93 % across doses of 12 . 5 mg to 800 mg .
Inhibition of DPP - 4 remained above 80 % at 24 hours for doses greater than or equal to 25 mg .
Peak and total exposure over 24 hours to active GLP - 1 were three - to four - fold greater with NESINA ( at doses of 25 to 200 mg ) than placebo .
In a 16 - week , double - blind , placebo - controlled study , NESINA 25 mg demonstrated decreases in postprandial glucagon while increasing postprandial active GLP - 1 levels compared to placebo over an eight - hour period following a standardized meal .
It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in overall glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus .
In this study , NESINA 25 mg demonstrated decreases in two - hour postprandial glucose compared to placebo ( - 30 mg / dL versus 17 mg / dL , respectively ) .
Multiple - dose administration of alogliptin to patients with type 2 diabetes also resulted in a peak inhibition of DPP - 4 within one to two hours and exceeded 93 % across all doses ( 25 mg , 100 mg and 400 mg ) after a single dose and after 14 days of once - daily dosing .
At these doses of NESINA , inhibition of DPP - 4 remained above 81 % at 24 hours after 14 days of dosing .
Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized , placebo - controlled , four - arm , parallel - group study , 257 subjects were administered either alogliptin 50 mg , alogliptin 400 mg , moxifloxacin 400 mg or placebo once daily for a total of seven days .
No increase in corrected QT ( QTc ) was observed with either dose of alogliptin .
At the 400 mg dose , peak alogliptin plasma concentrations were 19 - fold higher than the peak concentrations following the maximum recommended clinical dose of 25 mg .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of NESINA has been studied in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes .
After administration of single , oral doses up to 800 mg in healthy subjects , the peak plasma alogliptin concentration ( median Tmax ) occurred one to two hours after dosing .
At the maximum recommended clinical dose of 25 mg , NESINA was eliminated with a mean terminal half - life ( T1 / 2 ) of approximately 21 hours .
After multiple - dose administration up to 400 mg for 14 days in patients with type 2 diabetes , accumulation of alogliptin was minimal with an increase in total [ e . g . , area under the plasma concentration curve ( AUC ) ] and peak ( i . e . , Cmax ) alogliptin exposures of 34 % and 9 % , respectively .
Total and peak exposure to alogliptin increased proportionally across single doses and multiple doses of alogliptin ranging from 25 mg to 400 mg .
The intersubject coefficient of variation for alogliptin AUC was 17 % .
The pharmacokinetics of NESINA was also shown to be similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes .
Absorption The absolute bioavailability of NESINA is approximately 100 % .
Administration of NESINA with a high - fat meal results in no significant change in total and peak exposure to alogliptin .
NESINA may therefore be administered with or without food .
Distribution Following a single , 12 . 5 mg intravenous infusion of alogliptin to healthy subjects , the volume of distribution during the terminal phase was 417 L , indicating that the drug is well distributed into tissues .
Alogliptin is 20 % bound to plasma proteins .
Metabolism Alogliptin does not undergo extensive metabolism and 60 % to 71 % of the dose is excreted as unchanged drug in the urine .
Two minor metabolites were detected following administration of an oral dose of [ 14 C ] alogliptin , N - demethylated , M - I ( less than 1 % of the parent compound ) , and N - acetylated alogliptin , M - II ( less than 6 % of the parent compound ) .
M - I is an active metabolite and is an inhibitor of DPP - 4 similar to the parent molecule ; M - II does not display any inhibitory activity toward DPP - 4 or other DPP - related enzymes .
In vitro data indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 contribute to the limited metabolism of alogliptin .
Alogliptin exists predominantly as the ( R ) - enantiomer ( more than 99 % ) and undergoes little or no chiral conversion in vivo to the ( S ) - enantiomer .
The ( S ) - enantiomer is not detectable at the 25 mg dose .
Excretion The primary route of elimination of [ 14 C ] alogliptin - derived radioactivity occurs via renal excretion ( 76 % ) with 13 % recovered in the feces , achieving a total recovery of 89 % of the administered radioactive dose .
The renal clearance of alogliptin ( 9 . 6 L / hr ) indicates some active renal tubular secretion and systemic clearance was 14 . 0 L / hr .
Special Populations Renal Impairment A single - dose , open - label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin 50 mg in patients with chronic renal impairment compared with healthy subjects .
In patients with mild renal impairment ( creatinine clearance [ CrCl ] ≥ 60 to < 90 mL / min ) , an approximate 1 . 2 - fold increase in plasma AUC of alogliptin was observed .
Because increases of this magnitude are not considered clinically relevant , dose adjustment for patients with mild renal impairment is not recommended .
In patients with moderate renal impairment ( CrCl ≥ 30 to < 60 mL / min ) , an approximate two - fold increase in plasma AUC of alogliptin was observed .
To maintain similar systemic exposures of NESINA to those with normal renal function , the recommended dose is 12 . 5 mg once daily in patients with moderate renal impairment .
In patients with severe renal impairment ( CrCl ≥ 15 to < 30 mL / min ) and end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) ( CrCl < 15 mL / min or requiring dialysis ) , an approximate three - and four - fold increase in plasma AUC of alogliptin were observed , respectively .
Dialysis removed approximately 7 % of the drug during a three - hour dialysis session .
NESINA may be administered without regard to the timing of the dialysis .
To maintain similar systemic exposures of NESINA to those with normal renal function , the recommended dose is 6 . 25 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment , as well as in patients with ESRD requiring dialysis .
Hepatic Impairment Total exposure to alogliptin was approximately 10 % lower and peak exposure was approximately 8 % lower in patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Grade B ) compared to healthy subjects .
The magnitude of these reductions is not considered to be clinically meaningful .
Patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh Grade C ) have not been studied .
Use caution when administering NESINA to patients with liver disease [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 4 ) ] .
Gender No dose adjustment of NESINA is necessary based on gender .
Gender did not have any clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin .
Geriatric No dose adjustment of NESINA is necessary based on age .
Age did not have any clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin .
Pediatric Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin in pediatric patients have not been performed .
Race No dose adjustment of NESINA is necessary based on race .
Race ( White , Black , and Asian ) did not have any clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin .
Drug Interactions In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In vitro studies indicate that alogliptin is neither an inducer of CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 , nor an inhibitor of CYP1A2 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 at clinically relevant concentrations .
In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Alogliptin on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs In clinical studies , alogliptin did not meaningfully increase the systemic exposure to the following drugs that are metabolized by CYP isozymes or excreted unchanged in urine ( Figure 1 ) .
No dose adjustment of NESINA is recommended based on results of the described pharmacokinetic studies .
Figure 1 .
Effect of Alogliptin on the Pharmacokinetic Exposure to Other Drugs [ MULTIMEDIA ] * Warfarin was given once daily at a stable dose in the range of 1 mg to 10 mg .
Alogliptin had no significant effect on the prothrombin time ( PT ) or International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) .
** Caffeine ( 1A2 substrate ) , tolbutamide ( 2C9 substrate ) , dextromethorphan ( 2D6 substrate ) , midazolam ( 3A4 substrate ) and fexofenadine ( P - gp substrate ) were administered as a cocktail .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Effects of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Alogliptin There are no clinically meaningful changes in the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin when NESINA is administered concomitantly with the drugs described below ( Figure 2 ) .

Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetic Exposure of Alogliptin [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Rats were administered oral doses of 75 , 400 and 800 mg / kg alogliptin for two years .
No drug - related tumors were observed up to 75 mg / kg or approximately 32 times the maximum recommended clinical dose of 25 mg , based on area under the plasma concentration curve ( AUC ) exposure .
At higher doses ( approximately 308 times the maximum recommended clinical dose of 25 mg ) , a combination of thyroid C - cell adenomas and carcinomas increased in male but not female rats .
No drug - related tumors were observed in mice after administration of 50 , 150 or 300 mg / kg alogliptin for two years , or up to approximately 51 times the maximum recommended clinical dose of 25 mg , based on AUC exposure .
Alogliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic , with and without metabolic activation , in the Ames test with S . typhimurium and E . coli or the cytogenetic assay in mouse lymphoma cells .
Alogliptin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus study .
In a fertility study in rats , alogliptin had no adverse effects on early embryonic development , mating or fertility at doses up to 500 mg / kg , or approximately 172 times the clinical dose based on plasma drug exposure ( AUC ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES NESINA has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with metformin , a sulfonylurea , a thiazolidinedione ( either alone or in combination with metformin or a sulfonylurea ) and insulin ( either alone or in combination with metformin ) .
A total of 14 , 053 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized in 11 double - blind , placebo - or active - controlled clinical safety and efficacy studies conducted to evaluate the effects of NESINA on glycemic control .
The racial distribution of patients exposed to study medication was 70 % Caucasian , 17 % Asian , 6 % Black and 7 % other racial groups .
The ethnic distribution was 30 % Hispanic .
Patients had an overall mean age of 57 years ( range 21 to 91 years ) .
In patients with type 2 diabetes , treatment with NESINA produced clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1c ( A1C ) compared to placebo .
As is typical for trials of agents to treat type 2 diabetes , the mean reduction in A1C with NESINA appears to be related to the degree of A1C elevation at baseline .
NESINA had similar changes from baseline in serum lipids compared to placebo .
14 . 1 Patients with Inadequate Glycemic Control on Diet and Exercise A total of 1768 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in three double - blind studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NESINA in patients with inadequate glycemic control on diet and exercise .
All three studies had a four week , single - blind , placebo run - in period followed by a 26 week randomized treatment period .
Patients who failed to meet prespecified hyperglycemic goals during the 26 week treatment periods received glycemic rescue therapy .
In a 26 week , double - blind , placebo - controlled study , a total of 329 patients ( mean baseline A1C = 8 % ) were randomized to receive NESINA 12 . 5 mg , NESINA 25 mg or placebo once daily .
Treatment with NESINA 25 mg resulted in statistically significant improvements from baseline in A1C and fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) compared to placebo at Week 26 ( Table 3 ) .
A total of 8 % of patients receiving NESINA 25 mg and 30 % of those receiving placebo required glycemic rescue therapy .

Patients were maintained on their insulin regimen ( median dose = 55 IU ) upon randomization and those previously treated with insulin in combination with metformin ( median dose = 1700 mg ) prior to randomization continued on the combination regimen during the treatment period .
Patients entered the trial on short - , intermediate - or long - acting ( basal ) insulin or premixed insulin .
Patients who failed to meet prespecified hyperglycemic goals during the 26 week treatment period received glycemic rescue therapy .
The addition of NESINA 25 mg once daily to insulin therapy resulted in statistically significant improvements from baseline in A1C and FPG at Week 26 , when compared to placebo ( Table 11 ) .
A total of 20 % of patients receiving NESINA 25 mg and 40 % of those receiving placebo required glycemic rescue .
Improvements in A1C were not affected by gender , age , baseline BMI or baseline insulin dose .
Clinically meaningful reductions in A1C were observed with NESINA compared to placebo regardless of whether subjects were receiving concomitant metformin and insulin ( - 0 . 2 % placebo versus - 0 . 8 % NESINA ) therapy or insulin alone ( 0 . 1 % placebo versus - 0 . 7 % NESINA ) .
The mean increase in body weight was similar between NESINA and placebo when given in combination with insulin .

The trial compared the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events ( MACE ) between NESINA ( N = 2701 ) and placebo ( N = 2679 ) when added to standard of care therapies for diabetes and atherosclerotic vascular disease ( ASCVD ) .
The trial was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued .
Eligible patients were adults with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control at baseline ( e . g . , HbA1c > 6 . 5 % ) and had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome event ( e . g . , acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina requiring hospitalization ) 15 to 90 days prior to randomization .
The dose of NESINA was based on estimated renal function at baseline per dosage and administration recommendations [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) ] .
The average time between an acute coronary syndrome event and randomization was approximately 48 days .
The mean age of the population was 61 years .
Most patients were male ( 68 % ) , Caucasian ( 73 % ) , and were recruited from outside of the United States ( 86 % ) .
Asian and Black patients contributed 20 % and 4 % of the total population , respectively .
At the time of randomization patients had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus for approximately 9 years , 87 % had a prior myocardial infarction and 14 % were current smokers .
Hypertension ( 83 % ) and renal impairment ( 27 % with an eGFR ≤ 60 ml / min / 1 . 73 m2 ) were prevalent co - morbid conditions .
Use of medications to treat diabetes ( e . g . , metformin 73 % , sulfonylurea 54 % , insulin 41 % ) , and ASCVD ( e . g . , statin 94 % , aspirin 93 % , renin - angiotensin system blocker 88 % , beta - blocker 87 % ) was similar between patients randomized to NESINA and placebo at baseline .
During the trial , medications to treat diabetes and ASCVD could be adjusted to ensure care for these conditions adhered to standard of care recommendations set by local practice guidelines .
The primary endpoint in EXAMINE was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of cardiovascular death , nonfatal myocardial infarction ( MI ) , or nonfatal stroke .
The study was designed to exclude a pre - specified risk margin of 1 . 3 for the hazard ratio of MACE .
The median exposure to study drug was 526 days and 95 % of the patients were followed to study completion or death .
Table 12 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and the contribution of each component to the primary MACE endpoint .
The upper bound of the confidence interval was 1 . 16 and excluded a risk margin larger than 1 . 3 .

The curves for placebo and NESINA overlap throughout the duration of the study .
The observed incidence of MACE was highest within the first 60 days after randomization in both treatment arms ( 14 . 8 MACE per 100 PY ) , decreased from day 60 to the end of the first year ( 8 . 4 per 100 PY ) and was lowest after one year of follow - up ( 5 . 2 per 100 PY ) .
Figure 4 .
Observed Cumulative Rate of MACE in EXAMINE [ MULTIMEDIA ] The rate of all cause death was similar between treatment arms with 153 ( 3 . 6 per 100 PY ) recorded among patients randomized to NESINA and 173 ( 4 . 1 per 100 PY ) among patients randomized to placebo .
A total of 112 deaths ( 2 . 9 per 100 PY ) among patients on NESINA and 130 among patients on placebo ( 3 . 5 per 100 PY ) were adjudicated as cardiovascular deaths .
