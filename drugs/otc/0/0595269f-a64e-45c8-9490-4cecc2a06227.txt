cGraded per NCI CTCAE v4 . 03 6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post - approval use of LENVIMA .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Gastrointestinal : pancreatitis , increased amylase General : impaired wound healing Hepatobiliary : cholecystitis Renal and Urinary : nephrotic syndrome Vascular : arterial ( including aortic ) aneurysms , dissections , and rupture 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Drugs That Prolong the QT Interval LENVIMA has been reported to prolong the QT / QTc interval .
Avoid coadministration of LENVIMA with medicinal products with a known potential to prolong the QT / QTc interval [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 9 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS • Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action , LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 1 ) ] .
In animal reproduction studies , oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended human doses resulted in embryotoxicity , fetotoxicity , and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits ( see Data ) .
There are no available human data informing the drug - associated risk .
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In an embryofetal development study , daily oral administration of lenvatinib mesylate at doses ≥ 0 . 3 mg / kg [ approximately 0 . 14 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg based on body surface area ( BSA ) ] to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in dose - related decreases in mean fetal body weight , delayed fetal ossifications , and dose - related increases in fetal external ( parietal edema and tail abnormalities ) , visceral , and skeletal anomalies .
Greater than 80 % postimplantation loss was observed at 1 . 0 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 5 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg based on BSA ) .
Daily oral administration of lenvatinib mesylate to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in fetal external ( short tail ) , visceral ( retroesophageal subclavian artery ) , and skeletal anomalies at doses greater than or equal to 0 . 03 mg / kg ( approximately 0 . 03 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg based on BSA ) .
At the 0 . 03 mg / kg dose , increased post - implantation loss , including 1 fetal death , was also observed .
Lenvatinib was abortifacient in rabbits , resulting in late abortions in approximately one - third of the rabbits treated at a dose level of 0 . 5 mg / kg / day ( approximately 0 . 5 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg based on BSA ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether LENVIMA is present in human milk ; however , lenvatinib and its metabolites are excreted in rat milk at concentrations higher than those in maternal plasma ( see Data ) .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children , advise women to discontinue breastfeeding during treatment with LENVIMA and for 1 week after the last dose .
Data Animal Data Following administration of radiolabeled lenvatinib to lactating Sprague Dawley rats , lenvatinib - related radioactivity was approximately 2 times higher [ based on area under the curve ( AUC ) ] in milk compared to maternal plasma .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on animal data and its mechanism of action , LENVIMA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Pregnancy Testing Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating LENVIMA [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment with LENVIMA and for 30 days after the last dose .
Infertility LENVIMA may impair fertility in males and females of reproductive potential [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of LENVIMA in pediatric patients have not been established .
Juvenile Animal Data Daily oral administration of lenvatinib mesylate to juvenile rats for 8 weeks starting on postnatal day 21 ( approximately equal to a human pediatric age of 2 years ) resulted in growth retardation ( decreased body weight gain , decreased food consumption , and decreases in the width and / or length of the femur and tibia ) and secondary delays in physical development and reproductive organ immaturity at doses greater than or equal to 2 mg / kg ( approximately 1 . 2 to 5 times the human exposure based on AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg ) .
Decreased length of the femur and tibia persisted following 4 weeks of recovery .
In general , the toxicologic profile of lenvatinib was similar between juvenile and adult rats , though toxicities including broken teeth at all dose levels and mortality at the 10 mg / kg / day dose level ( attributed to primary duodenal lesions ) occurred at earlier treatment time - points in juvenile rats .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Of the 261 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer ( DTC ) who received LENVIMA in SELECT , 45 % were ≥ 65 years of age and 11 % were ≥ 75 years of age .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects .
Of the 352 patients with renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) who received LENVIMA with pembrolizumab in CLEAR , 45 % were ≥ 65 years of age and 13 % were ≥ 75 years of age .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these elderly patients and younger patients .
Of the 62 patients with RCC who received LENVIMA with everolimus in Study 205 , 36 % were ≥ 65 years of age .
Conclusions are limited due to the small sample size , but there appeared to be no overall differences in safety or effectiveness between these subjects and younger subjects .
Of the 476 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) who received LENVIMA in REFLECT , 44 % were ≥ 65 years of age and 12 % were ≥ 75 years of age .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients ≥ 65 and younger subjects .
Patients ≥ 75 years of age showed reduced tolerability to LENVIMA .
Of 406 adult patients with endometrial carcinoma ( EC ) who were treated with LENVIMA in combination with pembrolizumab in Study 309 , 201 ( 50 % ) were 65 years and over .
No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly patients and younger patients .
8 . 6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild ( CLcr 60 - 89 mL / min ) or moderate ( CLcr 30 - 59 mL / min ) renal impairment .
Lenvatinib concentrations may increase in patients with DTC , RCC , or endometrial carcinoma and severe ( CLcr 15 - 29 mL / min ) renal impairment .
Reduce the dose of lenvatinib for patients with RCC , DTC , or endometrial carcinoma and severe renal impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) ] .
There is no recommended dose of LENVIMA for patients with HCC and severe renal impairment .
LENVIMA has not been studied in patients with end stage renal disease [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 5 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with HCC and mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh A ) .
There is no recommended dose for patients with HCC with moderate or severe hepatic impairment .
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with DTC , RCC , or endometrial carcinoma and mild or moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh A or B ) .
Lenvatinib concentrations may increase in patients with DTC , RCC , or endometrial carcinoma and severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh C ) .
Reduce the dose of lenvatinib for patients with DTC , RCC , or endometrial carcinoma and severe hepatic impairment [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 7 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
10 OVERDOSAGE Due to the high plasma protein binding , lenvatinib is not expected to be dialyzable [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Death due to multiorgan dysfunction occurred in a patient who received a single dose of LENVIMA 120 mg orally .
11 DESCRIPTION LENVIMA , a kinase inhibitor , is the mesylate salt of lenvatinib .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Lenvatinib is a kinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) receptors VEGFR1 ( FLT1 ) , VEGFR2 ( KDR ) , and VEGFR3 ( FLT4 ) .
Lenvatinib inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis , tumor growth , and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions , including fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) receptors FGFR1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ; platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha ( PDGFRα ) , KIT , and RET .
Lenvatinib also exhibited antiproliferative activity in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines dependent on activated FGFR signaling with a concurrent inhibition of FGF - receptor substrate 2α ( FRS2α ) phosphorylation .
In syngeneic mouse tumor models , lenvatinib decreased tumor - associated macrophages , increased activated cytotoxic T cells , and demonstrated greater antitumor activity in combination with an anti - PD - 1 monoclonal antibody compared to either treatment alone .
The combination of lenvatinib and everolimus showed increased antiangiogenic and antitumor activity as demonstrated by decreases in human endothelial cell proliferation , tube formation , and VEGF signaling in vitro , and by decreases in tumor volume in mouse xenograft models of human renal cell cancer that were greater than those with either drug alone .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Exposure - Response Relationships In a multicenter randomized ( 1 : 1 ) double blind trial of 152 patients with radioactive iodine ( RAI ) - refractory DTC , a dose - response relationship for overall response rate ( ORR ) was observed over the dose range of 18 mg ( 0 . 75 times the recommended dose of 24 mg ) and 24 mg .
A higher ORR was observed at the recommended lenvatinib dose .
No dose - response relationships for adverse reactions , serious adverse reactions , adverse reactions leading to study drug discontinuation , and adverse reactions leading to study drug interruption were observed over the same dose range .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics In patients with solid tumors administered single and multiple doses of LENVIMA once daily , the maximum lenvatinib plasma concentration ( Cmax ) and the area under the concentration - time curve ( AUC ) increased proportionally over the dose range of 3 . 2 mg ( 0 . 1 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg ) to 32 mg ( 1 . 33 times the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg ) with a median accumulation index of 0 . 96 ( 20 mg ) to 1 . 54 ( 6 . 4 mg ) .
Geometric mean Cmax and AUC values at steady state for RCC , DTC and HCC are summarized in the Table 13 .

Absorption The time to peak plasma concentration ( Tmax ) typically occurred from 1 to 4 hours post - dose .
Food Effect Administration with a high fat meal ( approximately 900 calories of which approximately 55 % were from fat , 15 % from protein , and 30 % from carbohydrates ) did not affect the extent of absorption , but decreased the rate of absorption and delayed the median Tmax from 2 hours to 4 hours .
Distribution Model - predicted geometric mean steady state volume of distribution is 97 L ( % CV , 30 . 2 % ) .
Protein binding of lenvatinib is 97 % to 99 % , which is independent of concentration , and is not impacted by hepatic or renal function .
The blood - to - plasma concentration ratio ranged from 0 . 59 to 0 . 61 at concentrations of 0 . 1 to 10 μg / mL in vitro .
Elimination The terminal elimination half - life of lenvatinib was approximately 28 hours .
Metabolism The main metabolic pathways for lenvatinib in humans were identified as enzymatic ( CYP3A and aldehyde oxidase ) and non - enzymatic processes .
Excretion Ten days after a single administration of radiolabeled lenvatinib , approximately 64 % and 25 % of the radiolabel were eliminated in the feces and urine , respectively .
Specific Populations Age ( 18 to 92 years ) , sex , race / ethnicity ( White , Black and Asian ) , tumor types ( DTC , RCC , HCC and other tumor types ) and renal impairment ( creatinine clearance : 15 - 89 mL / min ) did not have a significant effect on apparent oral clearance ( CL / F ) .
Subjects with end stage renal disease were not studied .
Patients with Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib following a single 10 mg dose were evaluated in subjects with mild ( Child - Pugh A ) or moderate ( Child - Pugh B ) hepatic impairment .
The pharmacokinetics of a single 5 mg dose were evaluated in subjects with severe ( Child - Pugh C ) hepatic impairment .
Compared to subjects with normal hepatic function , the dose - adjusted AUC0 - inf of lenvatinib for subjects with mild , moderate , and severe hepatic impairment were 119 % , 107 % , and 180 % , respectively .
Apparent oral clearance of lenvatinib in patients with HCC and mild hepatic impairment was similar to patients with HCC and moderate hepatic impairment .
Body Weight Lenvatinib exposures in patients with HCC in REFLECT were comparable between those weighing < 60 kg who received a starting dose of 8 mg and those ≥ 60 kg who received a starting dose of 12 mg .
Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Other Drugs on Lenvatinib CYP3A , P - gp , and BCRP Inhibitors : Ketoconazole ( 400 mg daily for 18 days ) increased lenvatinib ( administered as a single 5 mg dose on Day 5 ) AUC by 15 % and Cmax by 19 % .
P - gp Inhibitor : Rifampicin ( 600 mg as a single dose ) increased lenvatinib ( 24 mg as a single dose ) AUC by 31 % and Cmax by 33 % .
CYP3A and P - gp Inducers : Rifampicin ( 600 mg daily for 21 days ) decreased lenvatinib ( 24 mg as a single dose on Day 15 ) AUC by 18 % .
The Cmax was unchanged .
Population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that neither everolimus nor pembrolizumab meaningfully affect the pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib .
In Vitro Studies with Transporters : Lenvatinib is a substrate of P - gp and BCRP but not a substrate for organic anion transporter ( OAT ) 1 , OAT3 , organic anion transporting polypeptide ( OATP ) 1B1 , OATP1B3 , organic cation transporter ( OCT ) 1 , OCT2 , multidrug and toxin extrusion ( MATE ) 1 , MATE2 - K , or the bile salt export pump ( BSEP ) .
Effect of Lenvatinib on Other Drugs CYP2C8 Substrate : There is no projected significant drug - drug interaction risk between lenvatinib and repaglinide .
CYP3A4 Substrate : Co - administration of lenvatinib with midazolam had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam .
Population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that lenvatinib does not meaningfully affect the pharmacokinetics of either everolimus or pembrolizumab .
In Vitro Studies with Substrates of CYP or UDP - glucuronosyltransferase ( UGT ) : Lenvatinib inhibits CYP2C8 , CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , and CYP3A .
Lenvatinib does not inhibit CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 .
Lenvatinib induces CYP3A , but it does not induce CYP1A1 , CYP1A2 , CYP2B6 , and CYP2C9 .
Lenvatinib inhibits UGT1A1 , UGT1A4 , and UGT1A9 in vitro , but likely only inhibits UGT1A1 in vivo in the gastrointestinal tract based on the expression of the enzyme in tissues .
Lenvatinib does not inhibit UGT1A6 , UGT2B7 or aldehyde oxidase .
Lenvatinib does not induce UGT1A1 , UGT1A4 , UGT1A6 , UGT1A9 , or UGT2B7 .
In Vitro Studies with Substrates of Transporters : Lenvatinib does not have the potential to inhibit MATE1 , MATE2 - K , OCT1 , OCT2 , OAT1 , OAT3 , BSEP , OATP1B1 , or OATP1B3 in vivo .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with lenvatinib .
Lenvatinib mesylate was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay .
Lenvatinib was not clastogenic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase assay or the in vivo rat micronucleus assay .
No specific studies with lenvatinib have been conducted in animals to evaluate the effect on fertility ; however , results from general toxicology studies in rats , monkeys , and dogs suggest there is a potential for lenvatinib to impair fertility .
Male dogs exhibited testicular hypocellularity of the seminiferous epithelium and desquamated seminiferous epithelial cells in the epididymides at lenvatinib exposures approximately 0 . 02 to 0 . 09 times the AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg once daily .
Follicular atresia of the ovaries was observed in monkeys and rats at exposures 0 . 2 to 0 . 8 times and 10 to 44 times the AUC at the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg once daily , respectively .
In addition , in monkeys , a decreased incidence of menstruation was reported at lenvatinib exposures lower than those observed in humans at the recommended clinical dose of 24 mg once daily .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 1 Differentiated Thyroid Cancer A multicenter , randomized ( 2 : 1 ) , double - blind , placebo - controlled study ( SELECT ; NCT01321554 ) was conducted in 392 patients with locally recurrent or metastatic radioactive iodine - refractory differentiated thyroid cancer and radiographic evidence of disease progression within 12 months prior to randomization , confirmed by independent radiologic review .
Radioactive iodine ( RAI ) - refractory was defined as 1 or more measurable lesions with no iodine uptake on RAI scan , iodine uptake with progression within 12 months of RAI therapy , or having received cumulative RAI activity > 600 mCi ( 22 GBq ) with the last dose administered at least 6 months prior to study entry .
Patients were randomized to receive LENVIMA 24 mg once daily ( n = 261 ) or placebo ( n = 131 ) until disease progression .
Randomization was stratified by geographic region , prior VEGF / VEGFR - targeted therapy , and age .
The major efficacy outcome measure was progression - free survival ( PFS ) as determined by blinded independent radiologic review using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1 . 1 .
Independent review confirmation of disease progression was required prior to discontinuing patients from the randomization phase of the study .
Other efficacy outcome measures included objective response rate ( ORR ) and overall survival ( OS ) .
Patients in the placebo arm could receive lenvatinib following independent review confirmation of disease progression .
Of the 392 patients randomized , 51 % were male , the median age was 63 years , 40 % were 65 years or older , 79 % were White , 54 % had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) of 0 , and 24 % had received 1 prior VEGF / VEGFR - targeted therapy .
Metastases were present in 99 % of the patients : lungs in 89 % , lymph nodes in 52 % , bone in 39 % , liver in 18 % , and brain in 4 % .
The histological diagnoses were papillary thyroid cancer ( 66 % ) and follicular thyroid cancer ( 34 % ) ; of those with follicular histology , 44 % had Hürthle cell and 11 % had clear cell subtypes .
In the LENVIMA arm , 67 % of patients did not demonstrate iodine uptake on any RAI scan compared to 77 % in the placebo arm .
Additionally , 59 % of patients on the LENVIMA arm and 61 % of patients on placebo arm progressed , according to RECIST 1 . 1 , within 12 months of prior I 131 therapy ; 19 . 2 % of patients on the LENVIMA arm and 17 . 6 % of patients on placebo arm received prior cumulative activity of > 600 mCi or 22 GBq I 131 , with the last dose administered at least 6 months prior to study entry .
The median cumulative RAI activity administered prior to study entry was 350 mCi ( 12 . 95 GBq ) .
A statistically significant prolongation in PFS was demonstrated in LENVIMA - treated patients compared to those receiving placebo ( Table 14 and Figure 1 ) .
Upon confirmation of progression , 83 % of patients that were randomly assigned to placebo crossed over to receive open - label LENVIMA .

Patients were enrolled regardless of PD - L1 tumor expression status .
Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible .
Randomization was stratified by geographic region ( North America and Western Europe versus “ Rest of the World ” ) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center ( MSKCC ) prognostic groups ( favorable , intermediate and poor risk ) .
Patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) to one of the following treatment arms : • LENVIMA 20 mg orally once daily in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks up to 24 months .
• LENVIMA 18 mg orally once daily in combination with everolimus 5 mg orally once daily .
• Sunitinib 50 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks then off treatment for 2 weeks .
Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression .
Administration of LENVIMA with pembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST - defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered by the investigator to be deriving clinical benefit .
Pembrolizumab dosing was continued for a maximum of 24 months ; however , treatment with LENVIMA could be continued beyond 24 months .
Assessment of tumor status was performed at baseline and then every 8 weeks .
The study population characteristics were : median age of 62 years ( range : 29 to 88 years ) ; 42 % age 65 or older , 75 % male ; 74 % White , 21 % Asian , 1 % Black , and 2 % other races ; 18 % and 82 % of patients had a baseline KPS of 70 to 80 and 90 to 100 , respectively ; patient distribution by MSKCC risk categories was 27 % favorable , 64 % intermediate and 9 % poor .
Common sites of metastases in patients were lung ( 68 % ) , lymph node ( 45 % ) , and bone ( 25 % ) .
The major efficacy outcome measures were PFS , as assessed by independent radiologic review ( IRC ) according to RECIST v1 . 1 , and OS .
Additional efficacy outcome measures included confirmed ORR as assessed by IRC .
LENVIMA in combination with pembrolizumab demonstrated statistically significant improvements in PFS , OS , and ORR compared with sunitinib .

Previously Treated RCCin Combination with Everolimus ( Study 205 ) The efficacy was evaluated in a multicenter , randomized ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) study ( Study 205 : NCT01136733 ) , in which 153 patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma who have previously received anti - angiogenic therapy received LENVIMA 18 mg orally once daily with everolimus 5 mg orally once daily , LENVIMA 24 mg orally once daily , or everolimus 10 mg orally once daily .
Patients were required to have histological confirmation of clear cell RCC and ECOG PS of 0 or 1 .
Patients were stratified by hemoglobin level ( ≤ or > 13 g / dL for males and ≤ or > 11 . 5 g / dL for females ) and corrected serum calcium ( ≥ 10 mg / dL vs . < 10 mg / dL ) .
The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator - assessed PFS evaluated according to RECIST 1 . 1 .
Of the 101 patients randomized to the LENVIMA with everolimus arm or everolimus arm , 72 % were male , the median age was 60 years , 31 % were older than 65 years , and 96 % were White .
Metastases were present in 95 % of the patients and unresectable advanced disease was present in 5 % .
All patients had a baseline ECOG PS of either 0 ( 54 % ) or 1 ( 46 % ) with similar distribution across these two treatment arms .
MSKCC favorable , intermediate , and poor risk categories were observed respectively , in 24 % , 37 % , and 39 % of patients in the LENVIMA with everolimus arm , and 24 % , 38 % , and 38 % of patients in the everolimus arm .
Efficacy results from Study 205 are summarized in Table 16 and Figures 4 and 5 .
The treatment effect of the combination on PFS was supported by a retrospective independent review of radiographs with an observed hazard ratio ( HR ) of 0 . 43 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 24 , 0 . 75 ) compared with the everolimus arm .

The study enrolled adults with Child - Pugh A and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer ( BCLC ) Stage C or B HCC who were ineligible for local liver - directed therapy ; had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1 ; had received no prior systemic therapy for HCC ; and had at least one measurable target lesion according to modified RECIST for HCC .
Patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to receive LENVIMA ( 12 mg for baseline body weight ≥ 60 kg or 8 mg for baseline body weight < 60 kg ) orally once daily or sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily until radiological disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Randomization was stratified by region ( Western vs Asia Pacific ) , presence of macroscopic portal vein invasion or extrahepatic spread ( yes vs no ) , ECOG PS ( 0 vs 1 ) , and body weight ( < 60 kg vs ≥ 60 kg ) .
The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival ( OS ) .
REFLECT was designed to show the non - inferiority of LENVIMA to sorafenib for OS .
Additional efficacy outcome measures were progression - free survival ( PFS ) and objective response rate ( ORR ) according to modified RECIST for HCC .
A total of 954 patients were randomized , 478 to the LENVIMA arm and 476 to the sorafenib arm .
The demographics of the study population were : median age of 62 years ( range : 20 to 88 years ) ; 84 % male ; 69 % Asian and 29 % White ; 63 % ECOG PS of 0 ; and 69 % weighed ≥ 60 kg .
Of the 590 ( 62 % ) patients with at least one site of documented distant metastatic disease , 52 % had lung metastasis , 45 % had lymph node metastasis , and 16 % had bone metastasis .
Macroscopic portal vein invasion , extra - hepatic spread , or both were present in 70 % of patients .
HCC was categorized as Child - Pugh A and BCLC Stage C in 79 % and Child - Pugh A and BCLC Stage B in 21 % of patients .
Seventy - five percent ( 75 % ) of patients had radiographic evidence of cirrhosis at baseline .
Investigator - documented primary risk factors for the development of HCC were hepatitis B ( 50 % ) , hepatitis C ( 23 % ) , alcohol use ( 6 % ) , other ( 7 % ) , and unknown ( 14 % ) .
REFLECT demonstrated that LENVIMA was non - inferior to sorafenib for OS .
REFLECT did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients randomized to LENVIMA as compared to those in the sorafenib arm .
LENVIMA was statistically significantly superior to sorafenib for PFS and ORR .

Patients with endometrial sarcoma , including carcinosarcoma , or patients who had active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible .
Patients with endometrial carcinoma that were pMMR ( using the VENTANA MMR RxDx Panel test ) or not MSI - H were stratified by ECOG performance status , geographic region , and history of pelvic radiation .
Patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to one of the following treatment arms : • LENVIMA 20 mg orally once daily in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks .
• Investigator ’ s choice consisting of either doxorubicin 60 mg / m2 every 3 weeks , or paclitaxel 80 mg / m2 given weekly , 3 weeks on / 1 week off .
Treatment with LENVIMA and pembrolizumab continued until RECIST v1 . 1 - defined progression of disease as verified by BICR , unacceptable toxicity , or for pembrolizumab , a maximum of 24 months .
Treatment was permitted beyond RECIST v1 . 1 - defined disease progression if the treating investigator considered the patient to be deriving clinical benefit and the treatment was tolerated .
Assessment of tumor status was performed every 8 weeks .
The major efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1 . 1 , modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ .
Additional efficacy outcome measures included ORR and DOR , as assessed by BICR .
Among the 697 pMMR or not MSI - H patients , 346 patients were randomized to LENVIMA in combination with pembrolizumab , and 351 patients were randomized to investigator ’ s choice of doxorubicin ( n = 254 ) or paclitaxel ( n = 97 ) .
The population characteristics of these patients were : median age of 65 years ( range : 30 to 86 ) , 52 % age 65 or older ; 62 % White , 22 % Asian , and 3 % Black ; 60 % ECOG PS of 0 and 40 % ECOG PS of 1 .
The histologic subtypes were endometrioid carcinoma ( 55 % ) , serous ( 30 % ) , clear cell carcinoma ( 7 % ) , mixed ( 4 % ) , and other ( 3 % ) .
All 697 of these patients received prior systemic therapy for endometrial carcinoma : 67 % had one , 30 % had two , and 3 % had three or more prior systemic therapies .
Thirty - seven percent of patients received only prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy .
Efficacy results for these patients are summarized in Table 18 and Figures 7 and 8 .
