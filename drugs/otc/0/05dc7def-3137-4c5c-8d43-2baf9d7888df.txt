How should I use the Novolin 70 / 30 vial ?
• Check to make sure that you have the correct type of insulin .
1 .
• Look at the vial and the insulin .
The insulin should be a cloudy or milky suspension .
The tamper - resistant cap should be in place before the first use .
If the cap had been removed before your first use of the vial , or if the precipitate ( the white deposit at the bottom of the vial ) has become lumpy or granular in appearance or has formed a deposit of solid particles on the wall of the vial , do not use it , and call Novo Nordisk at 1 - 800 - 727 - 6500 .
2 .
• Wash your hands with soap and water .
If you clean your injection site with an alcohol swab , let the injection site dry before you inject .
Talk with your healthcare provider about how to rotate injection sites and how to give an injection .
3 .
• If you are using a new vial , pull off the tamper - resistant cap .
Wipe the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab .
4 .
• Roll the vial gently 10 times in your hands to mix it .
This procedure should be carried out with the vial in a horizontal position .
The rolling procedure must be repeated until the suspension appears uniformly white and cloudy .
Shaking right before the dose is drawn into the syringe may cause bubbles or froth , which could cause you to draw up the wrong dose of insulin .
5 .
• Pull back the plunger on the syringe until the black tip reaches the marking for the number of units you will inject .
6 .
• Push the needle through the rubber stopper of the vial , and push the plunger all the way in to force air into the vial .
7 .
• Turn the vial and syringe upside down and slowly pull the plunger back to a few units beyond the correct dose .
8 .
• If there are any air bubbles , tap the syringe gently with your finger to raise the air bubbles to the top .
Then slowly push the plunger to the marking for your correct dose .
This process should move any air bubbles present in the syringe back into the vial .
9 .
• Check to make sure you have the right dose of Novolin 70 / 30 in the syringe .
10 .
• Pull the syringe with needle out of the vial ’ s rubber stopper .
11 .
• Your doctor should tell you if you need to pinch the skin before inserting the needle .
This can vary from patient to patient so it is important to ask your doctor if you did not receive instructions on pinching the skin .
Insert the needle into the skin .
Press the plunger of the syringe to inject the insulin .
When you are finished injecting the insulin , pull the needle out of your skin .
You may see a drop of Novolin 70 / 30 at the needle tip .
This is normal and has no effect on the dose you just received .
If you see blood after you take the needle out of your skin , press the injection site lightly with a piece of gauze or an alcohol wipe .
12 .
Do not rub the area .
• After your injection , do not recap the needle .
Place used syringes , needles and used insulin vials in a disposable puncture - resistant sharps container , or some type of hard plastic or metal container with a screw on cap such as a detergent bottle or coffee can .
