Adverse reactions reported include the following : anaphylactoid reaction , application site irritation , facial edema , paroxysmal sneezing , tolerance , urinary retention , and xerophthalmia .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7 . 1 Central Nervous System Depressants Concurrent use of azelastine HCl nasal spray , 0 . 15 % with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because reductions in alertness and impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
7 . 2 Erythromycin and Ketoconazole Interaction studies investigating the cardiac effects , as measured by the corrected QT interval ( QTc ) , of concomitantly administered oral azelastine HCl and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted .
Oral erythromycin ( 500 mg three times daily for 7 days ) had no effect on azelastine pharmacokinetics or QTc based on analyses of serial electrocardiograms .
Ketoconazole ( 200 mg twice daily for 7 days ) interfered with the measurement of azelastine plasma concentrations on the analytic HPLC ; however , no effects on QTc were observed [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) and ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 3 Cimetidine Cimetidine ( 400 mg twice daily ) increased the mean Cmax and AUC of orally administered azelastine HCl ( 4 mg twice daily ) by approximately 65 % [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited data from post - marketing experience over decades of use with azelastine HCl in pregnant women have not identified any drug associated risks of miscarriage , birth defects , or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes .
In animal reproduction studies , there was no evidence of fetal harm at oral doses approximately 4 times the clinical daily dose .
Oral administration of azelastine HCl to pregnant mice , rats , and rabbits , during the period of organogenesis , produced developmental toxicity that included structural abnormalities , decreased embryo - fetal survival , and decreased fetal body weights at doses 180 times and higher than the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose ( MRHDID ) of 1 . 644 mg .
However , the relevance of these findings in animals to pregnant women was considered questionable based upon the high animal to human dose multiple .
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown .
All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect , loss , or other adverse outcomes .
In the U . S . general population , the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 % to 4 % and 15 % to 20 % , respectively .
Data Animal Data In an embryo - fetal development study in mice dosed during the period of organogenesis , azelastine HCl caused embryo - fetal death , structural abnormalities ( cleft palate ; short or absent tail ; fused , absent or branched ribs ) , delayed ossification , and decreased fetal weight at approximately 200 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose ( MRHDID ) in adults ( on a mg / m2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68 . 6 mg / kg / day ) , which also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased maternal body weight .
Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred in mice at approximately 9 times the MRHDID in adults ( on a mg / m2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 3 mg / kg / day ) .
In an embryo - fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 7 to 17 , azelastine HCl caused structural abnormalities ( oligo - and brachydactylia ) , delayed ossification and skeletal variations , in the absence of maternal toxicity , at approximately 180 times the MRHDID in adults ( on a mg / m2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg / kg / day ) .
Azelastine HCl caused embryo - fetal death and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 410 times the MRHDID ( on a mg / m2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 68 . 6 mg / kg / day ) .
Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 10 times the MRHDID ( on a mg / m2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 2 mg / kg / day ) .
In an embryo - fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6 to 18 , azelastine HCl caused abortion , delayed ossification and decreased fetal weight and severe maternal toxicity at approximately 360 times the MRHDID in adults ( on a mg / m2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 30 mg / kg / day ) .
Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at approximately 4 times the MRHDID ( on a mg / m2 basis at a maternal oral dose of 0 . 3 mg / kg / day ) .
In a prenatal and postnatal development study in pregnant rats dosed from late in the gestation period and through the lactation period from gestation day 17 through lactation day 21 , azelastine HCl produced no adverse developmental effects on pups at maternal doses up to approximately 180 times the MRHDID ( on mg / m2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg / kg / day ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of azelastine HCl in human milk , the effects on the breastfed infant , or the effects on milk production following use of azelastine hydrochloride .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when azelastine HCl nasal spray , 0 . 15 % is administered to a nursing woman .
The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother ’ s clinical need for azelastine HCl and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from azelastine HCl or from the underlying maternal condition .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of azelastine HCl nasal spray , 0 . 15 % have been established for seasonal allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age and perennial allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age [ see Clinical Studies ( 14 ) ] .
The safety and effectiveness of azelastine HCl nasal spray , 0 . 15 % in pediatric patients below 6 years of age have not been established .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical trials of azelastine HCl nasal spray , 0 . 15 % did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Azelastine HCl , a phthalazinone derivative , exhibits histamine H1 - receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues , animal models , and humans .
Azelastine HCl nasal spray , 0 . 15 % is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies .
The major metabolite , desmethylazelastine , also possesses H1 - receptor antagonist activity .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Effects In a placebo - controlled trial ( 95 patients with allergic rhinitis ) , there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine HCl nasal spray ( 2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days ) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval ( QTc ) of the electrocardiogram .
Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily , the mean change in QTc was 7 . 2 msec and 3 . 6 msec , respectively .
Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine HCl and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted .
Oral erythromycin had no effect on azelastine pharmacokinetics or QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms .
Ketoconazole interfered with the measurement of azelastine plasma levels ; however , no effects on QTc were observed [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 2 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intranasal administration of 2 sprays per nostril ( 822 mcg total dose ) of azelastine HCl nasal spray , 0 . 15 % , the mean azelastine peak plasma concentration ( Cmax ) is 409 pg / mL , the mean extent of systemic exposure ( AUC ) is 9312 pg • hr / mL and the median time to reach Cmax ( tmax ) is 4 hours .
The systemic bioavailability of azelastine HCl is approximately 40 % after intranasal administration .
Distribution Based on intravenous and oral administration , the steady - state volume of distribution of azelastine is 14 . 5 L / kg .
