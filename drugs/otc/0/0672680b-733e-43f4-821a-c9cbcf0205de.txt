If diarrhea is controlled , INLYTA may be resumed at either the same dose or reduced by 1 dose level .
Grade 4 • • Withhold INLYTA until resolution to Grade < 2 , then restart INLYTA dose reduced by 1 dose level INLYTA in combination with avelumab Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events ( MACE ) Grade 3 or 4 • • Permanently discontinue [ 1 ] Based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) , version 4 . 0 .
[ 2 ] Consider corticosteroid therapy [ 3 ] If rechallenging with INLYTA , consider dosage reduction per Table 1 .
Consider rechallenge with a single drug or sequential rechallenge with both drugs after recovery .
• ALT = alanine aminotransferase , AST = aspartate aminotransferase , ULN = upper limit normal 2 . 3 Dosage Modification for Drug Interactions Strong CYP3A4 / 5 Inhibitors The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 / 5 inhibitors should be avoided ( e . g . , ketoconazole , itraconazole , clarithromycin , atazanavir , indinavir , nefazodone , nelfinavir , ritonavir , saquinavir , telithromycin , and voriconazole ) .
Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP3A4 / 5 inhibition potential is recommended .
Although INLYTA dose adjustment has not been studied in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 / 5 inhibitors , if a strong CYP3A4 / 5 inhibitor must be co - administered , a dose decrease of INLYTA by approximately half is recommended , as this dose reduction is predicted to adjust the axitinib area under the plasma concentration vs time curve ( AUC ) to the range observed without inhibitors .
The subsequent doses can be increased or decreased based on individual safety and tolerability .
If co - administration of the strong inhibitor is discontinued , the INLYTA dose should be returned ( after 3 – 5 half - lives of the inhibitor ) to that used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4 / 5 inhibitor [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
2 . 4 Dosage Modification for Hepatic Impairment No starting dose adjustment is required when administering INLYTA to patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class A ) .
Based on the pharmacokinetic data , the INLYTA starting dose should be reduced by approximately half in patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class B ) .
The subsequent doses can be increased or decreased based on individual safety and tolerability .
INLYTA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class C ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 12 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) , and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .

Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment .
Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents .
For elevated liver enzymes , interrupt or permanently discontinue INLYTA and avelumab or pembrolizumab , and administer corticosteroids as needed [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 3 ) ] .
With the combination of INLYTA and avelumab , Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT and increased AST were reported in 9 % and 7 % of patients , respectively .
In patients with ALT ≥ 3 times ULN ( Grades 2 – 4 , n = 82 ) , ALT resolved to Grades 0 – 1 in 92 % .
Among the 73 patients who were rechallenged with either avelumab ( n = 3 ) or axitinib ( n = 25 ) administered as a single agent or with both ( n = 45 ) , recurrence of ALT ≥ 3 times ULN was observed in no patient receiving avelumab , 6 patients receiving INLYTA , and 15 patients receiving both avelumab and INLYTA .
Twenty - two ( 88 % ) patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥ 3 ULN subsequently recovered to Grade 0 – 1 from the event .
Immune - mediated hepatitis was reported in 7 % of patients including 4 . 9 % with Grade 3 or 4 immune - mediated hepatitis .
Hepatotoxicity led to permanent discontinuation in 7 % and immune - mediated hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of either avelumab or INLYTA in 5 % of patients .
Thirty - four patients were treated with corticosteroids and one patient was treated with a non - steroidal immunosuppressant .
Resolution of hepatitis occurred in 31 of the 35 patients at the time of data cut - off .
With the combination of INLYTA and pembrolizumab , Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT ( 20 % ) and increased AST ( 13 % ) were seen .
Fifty - nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids .
In patients with ALT ≥ 3 times ULN ( Grades 2 – 4 , n = 116 ) , ALT resolved to Grades 0 – 1 in 94 % .
Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either pembrolizumab ( n = 3 ) or INLYTA ( n = 34 ) administered as a single agent or with both ( n = 55 ) , recurrence of ALT ≥ 3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving pembrolizumab , 16 patients receiving INLYTA , and 24 patients receiving both pembrolizumab and INLYTA .
All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥ 3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event .
5 . 12 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The systemic exposure to axitinib was higher in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class B ) compared to subjects with normal hepatic function .

6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of INLYTA .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
Vascular disorders : arterial ( including aortic ) , aneurysms , dissections , and rupture .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS • • Avoid strong CYP3A4 / 5 inhibitors .
If unavoidable , reduce the INLYTA dose .
( 2 . 2 , 7 . 1 ) • • Avoid strong CYP3A4 / 5 inducers .
( 7 . 2 ) 7 . 1CYP3A4 / 5 Inhibitors Co - administration of ketoconazole , a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 / 5 , increased the plasma exposure of axitinib in healthy volunteers .
Co - administration of INLYTA with strong CYP3A4 / 5 inhibitors should be avoided .
Grapefruit or grapefruit juice may also increase axitinib plasma concentrations and should be avoided .
Selection of concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP3A4 / 5 inhibition potential is recommended .
If a strong CYP3A4 / 5 inhibitor must be co - administered , the INLYTA dose should be reduced [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
7 . 2CYP3A4 / 5 Inducers Co - administration of rifampin , a strong inducer of CYP3A4 / 5 , reduced the plasma exposure of axitinib in healthy volunteers .
Co - administration of INLYTA with strong CYP3A4 / 5 inducers ( e . g . , rifampin , dexamethasone , phenytoin , carbamazepine , rifabutin , rifapentine , phenobarbital , and St . John ' s wort ) should be avoided .
Selection of concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP3A4 / 5 induction potential is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
Moderate CYP3A4 / 5 inducers ( e . g . , bosentan , efavirenz , etravirine , modafinil , and nafcillin ) may also reduce the plasma exposure of axitinib and should be avoided if possible .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation : Advise not to breastfeed .
( 8 . 2 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and its mechanism of action , INLYTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman .
There are no available human data to inform the drug - associated risk .
In developmental toxicity studies , axitinib was teratogenic , embryotoxic and fetotoxic in mice at exposures lower than human exposures at the recommended starting dose ( see Data ) .
Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus .
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown .
However , the background risk in the United States ( U . S . ) general population of major birth defects is 2 % – 4 % and of miscarriage is 15 % – 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies .
When INLYTA is used in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab , refer to the full prescribing information of avelumab or pembrolizumab for pregnancy information .
Data Animal Data Oral axitinib administered twice daily to female mice prior to mating and through the first week of pregnancy caused an increase in post - implantation loss at all doses tested ( ≥ 15 mg / kg / dose , approximately 10 times the systemic exposure ( AUC ) in patients at the recommended starting dose ) .
In an embryo - fetal developmental toxicity study , pregnant mice received oral doses of 0 . 15 , 0 . 5 and 1 . 5 mg / kg / dose axitinib twice daily during the period of organogenesis .
Embryo - fetal toxicities observed in the absence of maternal toxicity included malformation ( cleft palate ) at 1 . 5 mg / kg / dose ( approximately 0 . 5 times the AUC in patients at the recommended starting dose ) and variation in skeletal ossification at ≥ 0 . 5 mg / kg / dose ( approximately 0 . 15 times the AUC in patients at the recommended starting dose ) .
8 . 2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of axitinib in human milk , or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production .
Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from INLYTA , advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose .
When INLYTA is used in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab , refer to the full prescribing information of avelumab or pembrolizumab for lactation information .
8 . 3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on findings in animal studies , INLYTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
When INLYTA is used in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab , refer to the full prescribing information of avelumab or pembrolizumab for contraception information .
Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with INLYTA .
Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with INLYTA and for 1 week after the last dose .
Males Based on findings in animal studies , advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose .
Infertility Females and Males Based on findings in animals , INLYTA may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use The safety and efficacy of INLYTA in pediatric patients have not been studied .
Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Toxicities in bone and teeth were observed in immature mice and dogs administered oral axitinib twice daily for 1 month or longer .
Effects in bone consisted of thickened growth plates in mice and dogs at ≥ 15 mg / kg / dose ( approximately 6 and 15 times , respectively , the systemic exposure ( AUC ) in patients at the recommended starting dose ) .
Abnormalities in growing incisor teeth ( including dental caries , malocclusions and broken and / or missing teeth ) were observed in mice administered oral axitinib twice daily at ≥ 5 mg / kg / dose ( approximately 1 . 5 times the AUC in patients at the recommended starting dose ) .
Other toxicities of potential concern to pediatric patients have not been evaluated in juvenile animals .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC , 123 / 359 patients ( 34 % ) treated with INLYTA were ≥ 65 years of age .
Although greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out , no overall differences were observed in the safety and effectiveness of INLYTA between patients who were ≥ 65 years of age and younger .
Of the 434 patients randomized to INLYTA 5 mg twice daily administered in combination with avelumab 10 mg / kg in the JAVELIN Renal 101 trial , 38 % were 65 years or older and 8 % were 75 years or older .
No overall difference in safety or efficacy was reported between patients who were ≥ 65 years of age and younger .
Of the 432 patients randomized to INLYTA 5 mg twice daily administered in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg in the KEYNOTE - 426 trial , 40 % were 65 years or older .
No overall difference in safety or efficacy was reported between patients who were ≥ 65 years of age and younger .
No dosage adjustment is required in elderly patients [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment In a dedicated hepatic impairment trial , compared to subjects with normal hepatic function , systemic exposure following a single dose of INLYTA was similar in subjects with baseline mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class A ) and higher in subjects with baseline moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class B ) .
No starting dose adjustment is required when administering INLYTA to patients with mild hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class A ) .
A starting dose decrease is recommended when administering INLYTA to patients with moderate hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class B ) [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 12 ) , Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
INLYTA has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment ( Child - Pugh class C ) .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment No dedicated renal impairment trial for axitinib has been conducted .
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analyses , no significant difference in axitinib clearance was observed in patients with pre - existing mild to severe renal impairment ( 15 mL / min ≤ creatinine clearance [ CLcr ] < 89 mL / min ) [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 3 ) ] .
No starting dose adjustment is needed for patients with pre - existing mild to severe renal impairment .
Caution should be used in patients with end - stage renal disease ( CLcr < 15 mL / min ) .
10 OVERDOSAGE There is no specific treatment for INLYTA overdose .
In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC , 1 patient inadvertently received a dose of 20 mg twice daily for 4 days and experienced dizziness ( Grade 1 ) .
In a clinical dose finding study with INLYTA , subjects who received starting doses of 10 mg twice daily or 20 mg twice daily experienced adverse reactions which included hypertension , seizures associated with hypertension , and fatal hemoptysis .
In cases of suspected overdose , INLYTA should be withheld and supportive care instituted .
11 DESCRIPTION INLYTA ( axitinib ) is a kinase inhibitor .
Axitinib has the chemical name N - methyl - 2 - [ 3 - ( ( E ) - 2 - pyridin - 2 - yl - vinyl ) - 1 H - indazol - 6 - ylsulfanyl ] - benzamide .
The molecular formula is C22H18N4OS and the molecular weight is 386 . 47 Daltons .
The chemical structure is : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Axitinib is a white to light - yellow powder with a pKa of 4 . 8 .
The solubility of axitinib in aqueous media over the range pH 1 . 1 to pH 7 . 8 is in excess of 0 . 2 µg / mL .
The partition coefficient ( n - octanol / water ) is 3 . 5 .
INLYTA is supplied as red , film - coated tablets containing either 1 mg or 5 mg of axitinib together with microcrystalline cellulose , lactose monohydrate , croscarmellose sodium , magnesium stearate , and Opadry ® II red 32K15441 as inactive ingredients .
The Opadry II red 32K15441 film coating contains lactose monohydrate , HPMC 2910 / Hypromellose 15 cP , titanium dioxide , triacetin ( glycerol triacetate ) , and red iron oxide .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Axitinib has been shown to inhibit receptor tyrosine kinases including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors ( VEGFR ) - 1 , VEGFR - 2 , and VEGFR - 3 at therapeutic plasma concentrations .
These receptors are implicated in pathologic angiogenesis , tumor growth , and cancer progression .
VEGF - mediated endothelial cell proliferation and survival were inhibited by axitinib in vitro and in mouse models .
Axitinib was shown to inhibit tumor growth and phosphorylation of VEGFR - 2 in tumor xenograft mouse models .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics The effect of a single oral dose of INLYTA ( 5 mg ) in the absence and presence of 400 mg ketoconazole on the QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized , single - blinded , two - way crossover study in 35 healthy subjects .
No large changes in mean QTc interval ( i . e . , > 20 ms ) from placebo were detected up to 3 hours post - dose .
However , small increases in mean QTc interval ( i . e . , < 10 ms ) cannot be ruled out .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The population pharmacokinetic analysis pooled data from 17 trials in healthy subjects and patients with cancer .
A two - compartment disposition model with first - order absorption and lag - time adequately describes the axitinib concentration - time profile .
Absorption and Distribution Following single oral 5 - mg dose administration , the median Tmax ranged from 2 . 5 to 4 . 1 hours .
Based on the plasma half - life , steady state is expected within 2 to 3 days of dosing .
Dosing of axitinib at 5 mg twice daily resulted in approximately 1 . 4 - fold accumulation compared to administration of a single dose .
At steady state , axitinib exhibits approximately linear pharmacokinetics within the 1 - mg to 20 - mg dose range .
The mean absolute bioavailability of axitinib after an oral 5 mg dose is 58 % .
Compared to overnight fasting , administration of INLYTA with a moderate fat meal resulted in 10 % lower AUC and a high fat , high - calorie meal resulted in 19 % higher AUC .
INLYTA can be administered with or without food [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 1 ) ] .
Axitinib is highly bound ( > 99 % ) to human plasma proteins with preferential binding to albumin and moderate binding to α1 - acid glycoprotein .
In patients with advanced RCC ( n = 20 ) , at the 5 mg twice daily dose in the fed state , the geometric mean ( CV % ) Cmax and AUC0 – 24 were 27 . 8 ( 79 % ) ng / mL and 265 ( 77 % ) ng . h / mL , respectively .
The geometric mean ( CV % ) clearance and apparent volume of distribution were 38 ( 80 % ) L / h and 160 ( 105 % ) L , respectively .
Metabolism and Elimination The plasma half - life of INLYTA ranges from 2 . 5 to 6 . 1 hours .
Axitinib is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP3A4 / 5 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2 , CYP2C19 , and UGT1A1 .
Following oral administration of a 5 - mg radioactive dose of axitinib , approximately 41 % of the radioactivity was recovered in feces and approximately 23 % was recovered in urine .
Unchanged axitinib , accounting for 12 % of the dose , was the major component identified in feces .
Unchanged axitinib was not detected in urine ; the carboxylic acid and sulfoxide metabolites accounted for the majority of radioactivity in urine .
In plasma , the N - glucuronide metabolite represented the predominant radioactive component ( 50 % of circulating radioactivity ) and unchanged axitinib and the sulfoxide metabolite each accounted for approximately 20 % of the circulating radioactivity .
The sulfoxide and N - glucuronide metabolites show approximately ≥ 400 - fold less in vitro potency against VEGFR - 2 compared to axitinib .
Drug - Drug Interactions Effects of Other Drugs on INLYTA Axitinib is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP3A4 / 5 .
Additionally , the aqueous solubility of axitinib is pH dependent , with higher pH resulting in lower solubility .
The effects of a strong CYP3A4 / 5 inhibitor , a strong CYP3A4 / 5 inducer , and an antacid on the pharmacokinetics of axitinib are presented in Figure 1 [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 . 1 , 7 . 2 ) ] .
Figure 1 .
Impact of Co - administered Drugs and Hepatic Impairment on Axitinib Pharmacokinetics [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Effects of INLYTA on Other Drugs In vitro studies demonstrated that axitinib has the potential to inhibit CYP1A2 and CYP2C8 .
However , co - administration of axitinib with paclitaxel , a CYP2C8 substrate , did not increase plasma concentrations of paclitaxel in patients .
In vitro studies indicated that axitinib does not inhibit CYP2A6 , CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 , CYP3A4 / 5 , or UGT1A1 at therapeutic plasma concentrations .
In vitro studies in human hepatocytes indicated that axitinib does not induce CYP1A1 , CYP1A2 , or CYP3A4 / 5 .
Axitinib is an inhibitor of the efflux transporter P - glycoprotein ( P - gp ) in vitro .
However , INLYTA is not expected to inhibit P - gp at therapeutic plasma concentrations .
Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of axitinib are presented in Figure 1 [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2 . 2 ) , Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 12 ) , Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 6 ) ] .
Patients with Renal Impairment Population pharmacokinetic analysis ( based on pre - existing renal function ) was carried out in 590 healthy volunteers and patients , including five with severe renal impairment ( 15 mL / min ≤ CLcr < 29 mL / min ) , 64 with moderate renal impairment ( 30 mL / min ≤ CLcr < 59 mL / min ) , and 139 with mild renal impairment ( 60 mL / min ≤ CLcr < 89 mL / min ) .
Mild to severe renal impairment did not have meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of axitinib .
Data from only one patient with end - stage renal disease are available [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 7 ) ] .
Other Intrinsic Factors Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that there are no clinically relevant effects of age , gender , race , body weight , body surface area , UGT1A1 genotype , or CYP2C19 genotype on the clearance of axitinib .
INLYTA in Combination with Avelumab When INLYTA 5 mg was administered in combination with avelumab 10 mg / kg , the respective exposures of INLYTA and avelumab were comparable to the single agents .
There was no evidence to suggest a clinically relevant change of avelumab clearance over time in patients with advanced RCC .
INLYTA in Combination with Pembrolizumab When INLYTA 5 mg was administered in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg , the respective exposures of INLYTA and pembrolizumab were comparable to the single agents .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with axitinib .
Axitinib was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation ( Ames ) assay and was not clastogenic in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay .
Axitinib was genotoxic in the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay .
INLYTA has the potential to impair reproductive function and fertility in humans .
In repeat - dose toxicology studies , findings in the male reproductive tract were observed in the testes / epididymis ( decreased organ weight , atrophy or degeneration , decreased numbers of germinal cells , hypospermia or abnormal sperm forms , reduced sperm density and count ) at ≥ 15 mg / kg / dose administered orally twice daily in mice ( approximately 7 times the systemic exposure ( AUC ) in patients at the recommended starting dose ) and ≥ 1 . 5 mg / kg / dose administered orally twice daily in dogs ( approximately 0 . 1 times the AUC in patients at the recommended starting dose ) .
Findings in the female reproductive tract in mice and dogs included signs of delayed sexual maturity , reduced or absent corpora lutea , decreased uterine weights and uterine atrophy at ≥ 5 mg / kg / dose ( approximately 1 . 5 or 0 . 3 times the AUC in patients at the recommended starting dose compared to mice and dogs , respectively ) .
In a fertility study in mice , axitinib did not affect mating or fertility rate when administered orally twice daily to males at any dose tested up to 50 mg / kg / dose following at least 70 days of administration ( approximately 57 times the AUC in patients at the recommended starting dose ) .
In female mice , reduced fertility and embryonic viability were observed at all doses tested ( ≥ 15 mg / kg / dose administered orally twice daily ) following at least 15 days of treatment with axitinib ( approximately 10 times the AUC in patients at the recommended starting dose ) .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14 . 1 First - Line Advanced RCC INLYTA in Combination with Avelumab The efficacy and safety of INLYTA in combination with avelumab was demonstrated in the JAVELIN Renal 101 trial ( NCT02684006 ) , a randomized , multicenter , open - label , study of INLYTA in combination with avelumab in 886 patients with untreated advanced RCC regardless of tumor PD - L1 expression [ intent - to - treat ( ITT ) population ] .
Patients with autoimmune disease or conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded .
Randomization was stratified according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status ( PS ) ( 0 vs . 1 ) and region ( United States vs . Canada / Western Europe vs . the rest of the world ) .
Patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to one of the following treatment arms : • • INLYTA 5 mg twice daily orally was given in combination with avelumab 10 mg / kg intravenous infusion every 2 weeks ( N = 442 ) .
Patients who tolerated INLYTA 5 mg twice daily without Grade 2 or greater INLYTA - related adverse events for 2 consecutive weeks could increase to 7 mg and then subsequently to 10 mg twice daily .
INLYTA could be interrupted or reduced to 3 mg twice daily and subsequently to 2 mg twice daily to manage toxicity .
• • Sunitinib 50 mg once daily orally for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off ( N = 444 ) until radiographic or clinical progression or unacceptable toxicity .
Treatment with INLYTA and avelumab continued until RECIST v1 . 1 - defined progression of disease by Blinded Independent Central Review ( BICR ) assessment or unacceptable toxicity .
Administration of INLYTA and avelumab was permitted beyond RECIST - defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator .
Assessment of tumor status was performed at baseline , after randomization at 6 weeks , then every 6 weeks thereafter up to 18 months after randomization , and every 12 weeks thereafter until documented confirmed disease progression by BICR .
Baseline characteristics were a median age of 61 years ( range : 27 to 88 ) , 38 % of patients were 65 years or older , 75 % were male , 75 % were White , and the ECOG PS was 0 ( 63 % ) or 1 ( 37 % ) , respectively .
Patient distribution by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database ( IMDC ) risk groups was 21 % favorable , 62 % intermediate , and 16 % poor .
The major efficacy outcome measures were progression - free survival ( PFS ) , as assessed by an BICR using RECIST v1 . 1 and overall survival ( OS ) in patients with PD - L1 - positive tumors using a clinical trial assay ( PD - L1 expression level ≥ 1 % ) .
Since PFS was statistically significant in patients with PD - L1 - positive tumors [ HR 0 . 61 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 48 , 0 . 79 ) ] , it was then tested in the ITT population and a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the ITT population was also demonstrated .
With a median overall survival follow - up of 19 months , overall survival data were immature with 27 % deaths in the ITT population .
Efficacy results are presented in Table 10 and Figure 2 .

K - M Estimates for PFS Based on BICR Assessment - ITT [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] INLYTA in Combination with Pembrolizumab The efficacy of INLYTA in combination with pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE - 426 ( NCT02853331 ) , a randomized , multicenter , open - label trial conducted in 861 patients who had not received systemic therapy for advanced RCC .
Patients were enrolled regardless of PD - L1 tumor expression status .
Patients with active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppression within the last 2 years were ineligible .
Randomization was stratified by International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium ( IMDC ) risk categories ( favorable versus intermediate versus poor ) and geographic region ( North America versus Western Europe versus " Rest of the World " ) .
Patients were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to one of the following treatment arms : • • INLYTA 5 mg orally , twice daily in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks up to 24 months .
Patients who tolerated INLYTA 5 mg twice daily for 2 consecutive cycles ( 6 weeks ) could increase to 7 mg and then subsequently to 10 mg twice daily .
INLYTA could be interrupted or reduced to 3 mg twice daily and subsequently to 2 mg twice daily to manage toxicity .
• • Sunitinib 50 mg orally , once daily for 4 weeks and then off treatment for 2 weeks .
Treatment with INLYTA and pembrolizumab continued until RECIST v1 . 1 - defined progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity .
Administration of INLYTA and pembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST - defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator .
Assessment of tumor status was performed at baseline , after randomization at Week 12 , then every 6 weeks thereafter until Week 54 , and then every 12 weeks thereafter .
The study population characteristics were : median age of 62 years ( range : 26 to 90 ) ; 38 % age 65 or older ; 73 % male ; 79 % White and 16 % Asian ; 20 % and 80 % of patients had a baseline KPS of 70 to 80 and 90 to 100 , respectively ; and patient distribution by IMDC risk categories was 31 % favorable , 56 % intermediate and 13 % poor .
The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1 . 1 , modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ .
Additional efficacy outcome measures included ORR , as assessed by BICR .
A statistically significant improvement in OS was demonstrated at the first pre - specified interim analysis in patients randomized to INLYTA in combination with pembrolizumab compared with sunitinib .
The trial also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in PFS and ORR .
An updated OS analysis was conducted when 418 deaths were observed based on the planned number of deaths for the pre - specified final analysis .

Kaplan - Meier Curve for Overall Survival in KEYNOTE - 426 [ MULTIMEDIA ] In an exploratory analysis , the updated analysis of OS in patients with IMDC favorable , intermediate , intermediate / poor , and poor risk demonstrated a HR of 1 . 17 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 76 , 1 . 80 ) , 0 . 67 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 52 , 0 . 86 ) , 0 . 64 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 52 , 0 . 80 ) , and 0 . 51 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 32 , 0 . 81 ) , respectively .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 14 . 2 Second - Line Advanced RCC The safety and efficacy of INLYTA were evaluated in a randomized , open - label , multicenter Phase 3 study .
Patients ( N = 723 ) with advanced RCC whose disease had progressed on or after treatment with 1 prior systemic therapy , including sunitinib - , bevacizumab - , temsirolimus - , or cytokine - containing regimens were randomized ( 1 : 1 ) to receive INLYTA ( N = 361 ) or sorafenib ( N = 362 ) .
Progression - free survival ( PFS ) was assessed by a blinded independent central review committee .
Other endpoints included objective response rate ( ORR ) and overall survival ( OS ) .
Of the patients enrolled in this study , 389 patients ( 54 % ) had received 1 prior sunitinib - based therapy , 251 patients ( 35 % ) had received 1 prior cytokine - based therapy ( interleukin - 2 or interferon - alfa ) , 59 patients ( 8 % ) had received 1 prior bevacizumab - based therapy , and 24 patients ( 3 % ) had received 1 prior temsirolimus - based therapy .
The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the INLYTA and sorafenib groups with regard to age ( median 61 years ) , gender ( 72 % male ) , race ( 75 % white , 21 % Asian ) , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( 55 % 0 , 45 % 1 ) , and histology ( 99 % clear cell ) .
There was a statistically significant advantage for INLYTA over sorafenib for the endpoint of PFS ( see Table 12 and Figure 4 ) .
There was no statistically significant difference between the arms in OS .
