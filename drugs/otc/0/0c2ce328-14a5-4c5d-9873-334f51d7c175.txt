None ( 4 ) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS • Fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % has been shown to suppress the HPA axis .
Systemic absorption of fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % may produce reversible hypothalamic - pituitaryadrenal ( HPA ) axis suppression , Cushing ' s syndrome , hyperglycemia and unmask latent diabetes ( 5 . 1 ) • Systemic absorption may require evaluation for HPA axis suppression ( 5 . 1 ) • Modify use should HPA axis suppression develop ( 5 . 1 ) • Potent corticosteroids , use on large areas , prolonged use or occlusive use may increase systemic absorption ( 5 . 3 ) • Local adverse reactions with topical steroids may include atrophy , striae , irritation , acneiform eruptions , hypopigmentation and allergic contact dermatitis and may be more likely to occur with occlusive use or more potent corticosteroids ( 5 . 3 ) • Children may be more susceptible to systemic toxicity when treated with topical corticosteroids .
( 5 . 1 , 8 . 4 ) 5 . 1 Effect on Endocrine System Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids , including fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % , can produce reversible hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis suppression with the potential for clinical glucocorticosteroid insufficiency .
This may occur during treatment or upon withdrawal of the topical corticosteroid .
In addition , the use of fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % for longer than 2 weeks may suppress the immune system [ see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13 . 1 ) ] .
HPA axis suppression has been observed with fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % applied once or twice daily in 2 out of 18 adult patients with plaque - type psoriasis , 1 out of 31 adult patients with atopic dermatitis and 4 out of 123 pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis [ see Use in Specific Population ( 8 . 4 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12 . 2 ) ] .
Because of the potential for systemic absorption , use of topical corticosteroids , including fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % , may require that patients be periodically evaluated for HPA axis suppression .
Factors that predispose a patient using a topical corticosteroid to HPA axis suppression include the use of more potent steroids , use over large surface areas , use over prolonged periods , use under occlusion , use on an altered skin barrier , and use in patients with liver failure .
An ACTH stimulation test may be helpful in evaluating patients for HPA axis suppression .
If HPA axis suppression is documented , an attempt should be made to gradually withdraw the drug , to reduce the frequency of application , or to substitute a less potent steroid .
Manifestations of adrenal insufficiency may require supplemental systemic corticosteroids .
Recovery of HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of topical corticosteroids .
Cushing ' s syndrome , hyperglycemia , and unmasking of latent diabetes mellitus can also result from systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids .
Use of more than one corticosteroid - containing product at the same time may increase the total systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids .
Studies conducted in pediatric patients demonstrated reversible HPA axis suppression after use of fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % .
Pediatric patients may be more susceptible than adults to systemic toxicity from equivalent doses of fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % due to their larger skin surface - to - body - mass ratios [ See Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
5 . 2 Local Adverse Reactions with Topical Corticosteroids Local adverse reactions may be more likely to occur with occlusive use , prolonged use or use of higher potency corticosteroids .
Reactions may include atrophy , striae , telangiectasis , burning , itching , irritation , dryness , folliculitis , acneiform eruptions , hypopigmentation , perioral dermatitis , allergic contact dermatitis , secondary infection , and miliaria .
Some local adverse reactions may be irreversible .
5 . 3 Concomitant Skin Infections If concomitant skin infections are present or develop , an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be used .
If a favorable response does not occur promptly , use of fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled .
5 . 4 Allergic Contact Dermatitis If irritation develops , fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted .
Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing failure to heal rather than noting a clinical exacerbation as with most topical products not containing corticosteroids .
Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate diagnostic patch testing .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most commonly reported adverse reactions ( ≥ 1 % ) were headache , application site burning , nasopharyngitis , and nasal congestion .
( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS , contact Taro Pharmaceuticals U . S . A . , Inc . , at 1 - 866 - 923 - 4914 or FDA at 1 - 800 - FDA - 1088 or www . fda . gov / medwatch .
6 . 1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions , adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice .
In clinical trials , a total of 443 adult subjects with atopic dermatitis or plaque - type psoriasis were treated once daily or twice daily with fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % for 2 weeks .
The most commonly observed adverse reactions in these clinical trials were as follows : Table 1 : Most Commonly Observed Adverse Reactions ( ≥ 1 % ) in Adult Clinical TrialsAdverse Reaction Fluocinonide Cream USP , 0 . 1 % , once daily ( n = 216 ) Fluocinonide Cream USP , 0 . 1 % , twice daily ( n = 227 ) Vehicle Cream , once or twice daily ( n = 211 ) Headache 8 ( 3 . 7 % ) 9 ( 4 . 0 % ) 6 ( 2 . 8 % ) Application Site Burning 5 ( 2 . 3 % ) 4 ( 1 . 8 % ) 14 ( 6 . 6 % ) Nasopharyngitis 2 ( 0 . 9 % ) 3 ( 1 . 3 % ) 3 ( 1 . 4 % ) Nasal Congestion 3 ( 1 . 4 % ) 1 ( 0 . 4 % ) 0 Safety in patients 12 to 17 years of age was similar to that observed in adults .
6 . 2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % : Administration Site Conditions : discoloration , erythema , irritation , pruritus , swelling , pain and condition aggravated .
Immune System Disorders : hypersensitivity .
Nervous System Disorders : headache and dizziness .
Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : acne , dry skin , rash , skin exfoliation and skin tightness .
Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size , it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8 . 1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects : Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women .
Therefore , fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus .
Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels .
Some corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Systemically administered corticosteroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth , interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production , or cause other untoward effects .
It is not known whether topical administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk .
Nevertheless , a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug , taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age have not been established ; therefore use in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age is not recommended .
HPA axis suppression was studied in 4 sequential cohorts of pediatric patients with atopic dermatitis covering at least 20 % of the body surface area , treated once daily or twice daily with fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % .
The first cohort of 31 patients ( mean 36 . 3 % BSA ) 12 to < 18 years old ; the second cohort included 31 patients ( mean 39 . 0 % BSA ) 6 to < 12 years old ; the third cohort included 30 patients ( mean 34 . 6 % BSA ) 2 to < 6 years old ; the fourth cohort included 31 patients ( mean 40 . 0 % BSA ) 3 months to < 2 years old .
Fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % caused HPA - axis suppression in 1 patient in the twice daily group in Cohort 1 , 2 patients in the twice daily group in Cohort 2 , and 1 patient in the twice daily group in Cohort 3 .
Follow - up testing 14 days after treatment discontinuation , available for all 4 suppressed patients , demonstrated a normally responsive HPA axis .
Signs of skin atrophy were present at baseline and severity was not determined making it difficult to assess local skin safety .
Therefore , the safety of fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % in patients younger than 12 years of age has not been demonstrated [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
HPA axis suppression has not been evaluated in patients with psoriasis who are less than 18 years of age .
Because of a higher ratio of skin surface area to body mass , pediatric patients are at a greater risk than adults of HPA - axis suppression and Cushing ' s syndrome when they are treated with topical corticosteroids .
They are therefore also at greater risk of adrenal insufficiency during or after withdrawal of treatment .
Adverse effects including striae have been reported with inappropriate use of topical corticosteroids in infants and children .
HPA - axis suppression , Cushing ' s syndrome , linear growth retardation , delayed weight gain , and intracranial hypertension have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids .
Manifestations of adrenal suppression in children include low plasma cortisol levels and absence of response to cosyntropin ( ACTH1 - 24 ) stimulation .
Manifestations of intracranial hypertension include bulging fontanelles , headaches , and bilateral papilledema .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
10 OVERDOSAGE Topically applied fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % can be absorbed in sufficient amounts to produce systemic effects [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
11 DESCRIPTION Fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % contains fluocinonide , a synthetic corticosteroid for topical dermatologic use .
The corticosteroids constitute a class of primarily synthetic steroids used topically as anti - inflammatory and antipruritic agents .
Fluocinonide has the chemical name 6 alpha , 9 alpha - difluoro - 11 beta , 21 - dihydroxy - 16 alpha , 17 alpha - isopropylidenedioxypregna - 1 , 4 - diene - 3 , 20 - dione 21 - acetate .
Its chemical formula is C26H32F2O7 and it has a molecular weight of 494 . 58 .
It has the following chemical structure : [ MULTIMEDIA ] Fluocinonide , USP is an almost odorless white to creamy white crystalline powder .
It is practically insoluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol .
Each gram of fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % contains 1 mg micronized fluocinonide in a cream base of carbomer 940 ( carbopol 980 ) , ceteareth - 20 , citric acid , diethylene glycol monoethyl ether ( transcutol P ) , polyethylene glycol , propylene glycol , sorbitan monostearate , and trolamine .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action Corticosteroids play a role in cellular signaling , immune function , inflammation , and protein regulation ; however , the precise mechanism of action of fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % in corticosteroid responsive dermatoses is unknown .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics Vasoconstrictor studies performed with fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % in healthy subjects indicate that it is in the super - high range of potency as compared with other topical corticosteroids ; however , similar blanching scores do not necessarily imply therapeutic equivalence .
Application of fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % twice daily for 14 days in 18 adult subjects with plaque - type psoriasis ( 10 – 50 % BSA , mean 19 . 6 % BSA ) and 31 adult subjects ( 17 treated once daily ; 14 treated twice daily ) with atopic dermatitis ( 2 - 10 % BSA , mean 5 % BSA ) showed demonstrable HPA - axis suppression in 2 subjects with psoriasis ( with 12 % and 25 % BSA ) and 1 subject with atopic dermatitis ( treated once daily , 4 % BSA ) where the criterion for HPA - axis suppression is a serum cortisol level of less than or equal to 18 micrograms per deciliter 30 minutes after stimulation with cosyntropin ( ACTH1 - 24 ) [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) ] .
HPA - axis suppression following application of fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % ( once or twice daily ) was also evaluated in 123 pediatric patients from 3 months to < 18 years of age with atopic dermatitis ( mean BSA range 34 . 6 % - 40 . 0 % ) .
HPA - axis suppression was observed in 4 patients in the twice daily groups .
Follow - up testing 14 days after treatment discontinuation demonstrated a normally responsive HPA axis in all 4 suppressed patients [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 1 ) and Use in Specific populations ( 8 . 4 ) ] .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle and the integrity of the epidermal barrier .
Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin .
Inflammation and / or other disease processes in the skin may increase percutaneous absorption .
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13 . 1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility Long - term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % because of severe immunosuppression induced in a 13 - week dermal rat study .
The effects of fluocinonide on fertility have not been evaluated .
Fluocinonide revealed no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic potential based on the results of two in vitro genotoxicity tests ( Ames test and chromosomal aberration assay using human lymphocytes ) .
However , fluocinonide was positive for clastogenic potential when tested in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .
Topical ( dermal ) application of 0 . 0003 % - 0 . 03 % fluocinonide cream to rats once daily for 13 weeks resulted in a toxicity profile generally associated with long term exposure to corticosteroids including decreased skin thickness , adrenal atrophy , and severe immunosuppression .
A NOAEL could not be determined in this study .
In addition , topical ( dermal ) application of 0 . 1 % fluocinonide cream plus UVR exposure to hairless mice for 13 weeks and 150 - 900 mg / kg / day of 0 . 1 % fluocinonide cream to minipigs ( a model which more closely approximates human skin ) for 13 weeks produced glucocorticoid - related suppression of the HPA axis , with some signs of immunosuppression noted in the dermal minipig study .
Although the clinical relevance of the findings in animals to humans is not clear , sustained glucocorticoid - related immune suppression may increase the risk of infection and possibly the risk for carcinogenesis .
Topical doses of 0 % ( fluocinonide cream vehicle ) , 0 . 0001 % , 0 . 005 % and 0 . 001 % fluocinonide cream were evaluated in a 52 week dermal photocarcinogenicity study ( 40 weeks of treatment followed by 12 weeks of observation ) conducted in hairless albino mice with concurrent exposure to low level ultraviolet radiation .
Topical treatment with increasing concentrations of fluocinonide cream did not have an adverse effect in this study .
The results of this study suggest that topical treatment with fluocinonide cream would not enhance photocarcinogenesis .
14 CLINICAL STUDIES Two adequate and well - controlled efficacy and safety studies of fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % have been completed , one in adult subjects with plaque - type psoriasis ( Table 2 ) , and one in adult subjects with atopic dermatitis ( Table 3 ) .
In each of these studies , subjects with between 2 % and 10 % body surface area involvement at baseline treated all affected areas either once daily or twice daily with fluocinonide cream USP , 0 . 1 % for 14 consecutive days .
The primary measure of efficacy was the proportion of subjects whose condition was cleared or almost cleared at the end of treatment .
The results of these studies are presented in the tables below as percent and number of patients achieving treatment success at Week 2 .
