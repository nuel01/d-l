Description PYtest [ 1 ] ( 14 C - Urea Breath Test ) is a qualitative and non - invasive method for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori ( H . pylori ) .
To detect H . pylori , 14 C - urea supplied in a capsule is swallowed by the patient .
If gastric urease from H . pylori is present , Urea is split to form CO2 and NH3 .
Ten minutes after the patient ingests the capsule , a breath sample is collected into a balloon .
The breath sample is later transferred to collection fluid to trap the labeled CO2 .
The liquid sample is then analyzed in a liquid scintillation counter .
The PYtest null Kit ( 14 C - Urea Breath Test ) is designed for use with the PYtest null capsule , a gelatin capsule for oral administration containing 1 µCi of 14 C labeled urea .
The urea is adsorbed on sugar spheres and colored yellow with fluorescein .

Data on 14 C - urea Structural Formula ( 14 C - urea ) : NH2 14CONH2 Radiation emission : beta - emission , 49 keVmean , 156 keVmax , no other emissions External emission : No external radiation hazard .
Low - energy beta emissions only .
Maximum range of 0 . 3 mm in water .
Radiological Half - life : 5730 years Maximum effective dose equivalent ( EDE ) : 0 . 3 mrem / µCi [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] Clinical Pharmacology The urease enzyme is not present in mammalian cells , so the presence of urease in the stomach is evidence that bacteria are present .
The presence of urease is not specific for H . pylori , but other bacteria are not usually found in the stomach .
The principle of the breath test is shown in Figure 1 .
Figure 1 : Principle of Breath Test [ MULTIMEDIA ] To detect H . pylori , urea labeled with 14 C is swallowed by the patient .
If gastric urease from H . pylori is present , urea is split to form CO2 and NH3 at the interface between the gastric epithelium and lumen and14CO2 is absorbed into the blood and exhaled in the breath .
Following ingestion of the capsule by a patient with H . pylori , 14CO2excretion in the breath peaks between 10 and 15 minutes and declines thereafter with a biological half - life of about 15 minutes .
14 C - urea that is not hydrolyzed by H . pylori is excreted in the urine with a half - life of approximately 12 hours .
About 10 % of the 14 C remains in the body at 72 hours and is gradually excreted with a biological half - life of 40 days .
Clinical Studies Two studies were performed .
In both studies , patients with gastrointestinal symptoms underwent the breath test and an endoscopy .
During the endoscopy , biopsy samples were taken from the antral gastric mucosa for histological analysis ( 2 samples , Giemsa stain ) and rapid urease test ( 1 sample , CLOtest null ) .
Breath samples were mailed to the TRI - MED lab where they were read in a liquid scintillation counter .
Results were reported as disintegrations per minute ( DPM ) .
Analysis for accuracy used the ten minute breath sample .
A breath sample DPM < 50 was defined as a negative result .
DPM ≥ 200 was defined as a positive result .
DPM in the range of 50 - 199 was classified as indeterminate .
STUDY 1 Of 186 patients who had histopathology and CLOtest null ( 80 men , 106 women ) , 53 were infected with H . pylori as determined by agreement between histology and CLOtest null .
The study results are summarized below : Table 1 : Study # 1 ( n = 186 , Indeterminate results included ) Histology and CLOtest null H . pylori Positive Negative Total Notes : PYtest null at 10 min .
was compared to the gold standard of biopsy results in which histology and CLOtest null concurred .
Patients who did not have both biopsy tests performed , or in whom the tests differed , were excluded from analysis .
There was no statistical difference in test accuracy based on gender of patient .

The test utilizes a liquid scintillation counter for the measurement of 14CO2 in breath samples .
Contraindications None Warnings None Precautions General After the patient ingests the 14 C - urea capsule , the sample collected for test purposes is for in vitro diagnostic use only .
A false positive test could occur in patients who have achlorhydria .
Very rarely , a false positive test may occur due to urease associated with Helicobacters other than H . pylori ( i . e . Helicobacter heilmanni ) .
Limitations of the Test • The test has been evaluated in outpatients before elective endoscopy .
• Test results should be evaluated with clinical signs and patient history when diagnosing H . pylori infection .
• The performance characteristics of the test have not been established for monitoring the efficacy of antimicrobial therapies for the treatment of H . pylori infection .
• A negative result does not completely rule out the possibility ofH . pylori infection .
If clinical signs and patient history suggest H . pyloriinfection , repeat the PYtest null or use an alternative diagnostic method .
• The integrity of samples in balloons sent by air transport has not been adequately determined .
In studies simulating the effects of air transport for two to seven days at temperatures of - 40 ° C , 20 ° C and 55 ° C , no balloon failures were observed .
However , the data could not provide statistical determination that no changes in 14CO2concentration took place .
• For ground transport , integrity of samples in balloons has not been determined beyond 7 days .
During this time frame , concentration of labeled CO2 can decrease as much as 0 . 36 % per day .
Radioactivity Persons concerned about very low doses of radioactivity may postpone the test or may decide to use an alternative means of diagnosis .
The test produces radiation exposure equal to 24 hours of normal background .
In animal experiments , such low doses of radiation do not carry measurable risk .
Preclinical studies were not conducted on 14 C - urea .
The estimated dose equivalent received from a single administration of PYtest null ( 1µCi 14 C ) is about 0 . 3 mrem .
Information for Patients It is necessary for the patient to fast for 6 hours before the test .
The patient should also be off antibiotics and bismuth for 1 month , and proton pump inhibitors and sucralfate for 2 weeks prior to the test .
Instruct the patient not to handle the capsule directly as this may interfere with the test result .
The capsule should be swallowed intact .
Do not chew the capsule .
Carcinogenesis , mutagenesis , impairment of fertility No studies have been conducted with 14 C - urea to evaluate its potential for carcinogenicity , impairment of fertility , or mutagenicity .
Drug Interactions Antibiotics , proton pump inhibitors , sucralfate , and bismuth preparations are known to suppress H . pylori .
Ingestion of antibiotics or bismuth within 4 weeks and proton pump inhibitors or sucralfate within 2 weeks prior to performing the test may give false negative results .
Pregnancy Pregnancy category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with PYtest null ( 14 C - urea ) .
It is also not known whether PYtest null can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
PYtest null should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Nursing mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , caution should be exercised when PYtest null is administered to a nursing woman .
Pediatric Use Clinical studies in children have not been conducted .
However , PYtest null is expected to work the same in children as in adults .
While the dose ( 1 capsule ) does not need to be adjusted , the child must be able to swallow the intact capsule and blow into a straw .
Adverse Reactions No adverse reactions were reported in clinical trials .
Overdosage Risk from radiation is negligible even with a 1000 capsule overdose ( 0 . 3 rem ) .
If overdose occurs , the patient may drink one glass of water ( 150 mL ) every hour to hasten excretion of the isotope .
Maximum excretion of Urea is achieved at a urine output of ≥ 2 . 0 mL / min .
Dosage and Administration Materials provided As shown in Figure 2 , the PYtest null Kit contains : • PYtest null capsule • Two 30 mL disposable cups • One drinking straw • One mylar collection balloon • One report form • One mailing box with labels [ 1 ] Figure 2 : PYtest null Kit [ MULTIMEDIA ] [ 1 ] The kit includes analysis by Kimberly - Clark of one balloon from one patient at one time point .
Materials Needed but not Provided • Stopwatch / Timer capable of timing an interval up to 10 minutes .
• Water ( 40 mL ) Dosage One PYtest null capsule .
Procedural Notes • Inform the patient to fast for 6 hours prior to the test .
• The patient should be off antibiotics and bismuth for 1 month , and proton pump inhibitors and sucralfate for 2 weeks prior to the test .
• Have patient sitting at rest while doing the test .
• The capsule should not be handled directly as this may interfere with the test result .
• To avoid contamination by bacteria in the mouth , the capsule should be swallowed intact .
Do not chew capsule .
Step by Step Procedure for Balloon Table 3 : Breath Sample Collection by BalloonBefore the test • Label balloon and fill in breath test report form .
• Check that all materials are present .
Minus 1 • Open the package containing the 14 C - urea capsule minute and tip the capsule into the empty 30 mL cup .
Do not handle the capsule directly .
• Hand the cup to the patient .
• Fill the second cup with 20 mL lukewarm water .
0 minute • Ask the patient to tip the capsule directly into his / her mouth , then swallow it with the 20 mL of lukewarm water .
• Start the stopwatch when the patient swallows the capsule .
• Discard waste ( e . g . , capsule packaging , used straws ) according to your facility ' s regulations .
3 minutes Ask the patient to drink another 20 mL of lukewarm water ( in case the capsule may have lodged in the esophagus and not yet reached the gastric mucosa ) .
10 minutes • Push a drinking straw into the neck of the balloon .
• Ask the patient to hold his / her breath for 5 - 10 seconds , then blow up a balloon with a slow breath through the straw , filling the balloon completely .
• Tie the neck of the balloon into a tight knot .
• Check that the balloon label and the breath test report form are completed correctly .
After the test Place the filled balloon and breath test report in the box and forward to Kimberly - Clark for analysis .
Quality Control A minimum of 1 mM of CO2 is required to perform analysis of a breath sample .
The amount of breath required to provide 1 mM of CO2varies depending on the amount of CO2 the patient is producing .
Since a full balloon typically contains at least 1 mM of CO2 , the balloon should be completely filled .
Results Interpretation of results ( 10 minute sample ) < 50 DPM Negative for H . pylori 50 - 199 DPM Indeterminate for H . pylori ≥ 200 DPM Positive for H . pylori The indeterminate result should be evaluated by repeating the PYtest null or using an alternative diagnostic method .
If repeat breath testing is undertaken , careful history to exclude confounding factors should be obtained .
If confounding factors are present , wait an appropriate time ( refer to Table 4 ) before repeating the PYtest null .
The cutoff point of 50 DPM was determined to be the mean + 3 SD of results obtained in patients who did not have H . pylori .
