Stop at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery .
Start no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery , in women who are not breastfeeding .
( 5 . 1 ) • Liver disease : Discontinue Nymyo if jaundice occurs .
( 5 . 2 ) • High blood pressure : If used in women with well - controlled hypertension , monitor blood pressure and stop Nymyo if blood pressure rises significantly .
( 5 . 4 ) • Carbohydrate and lipid metabolic effects : Monitor prediabetic and diabetic women taking Nymyo .
Consider an alternate contraceptive method for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemia .
( 5 . 6 ) • Headache : Evaluate significant change in headaches and discontinue Nymyo if indicated .
( 5 . 7 ) • Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea : Evaluate irregular bleeding or amenorrhea .
( 5 . 8 ) 5 . 1 Thrombotic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems • Stop Nymyo if an arterial thrombotic event or venous thromboembolic ( VTE ) event occurs .
• Stop Nymyo if there is unexplained loss of vision , proptosis , diplopia , papilledema , or retinal vascular lesions .
Evaluate for retinal vein thrombosis immediately [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6 . 2 ) ] .
• If feasible , stop Nymyo at least 4 weeks before and through 2 weeks after major surgery or other surgeries known to have an elevated risk of VTE as well as during and following prolonged immobilization .
• Start Nymyo no earlier than 4 weeks after delivery , in women who are not breastfeeding .
The risk of postpartum VTE decreases after the third postpartum week , whereas the risk of ovulation increases after the third postpartum week .
• The use of COCs increases the risk of VTE .
However , pregnancy increases the risk of VTE as much or more than the use of COCs .
The risk of VTE in women using COCs is 3 to 9 cases per 10 , 000 woman - years .
The risk of VTE is highest during the first year of use of COCs and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of 4 weeks or longer .
The risk of thromboembolic disease due to COCs gradually disappears after use is discontinued .
• Use of COCs also increases the risk of arterial thromboses such as strokes and myocardial infarctions , especially in women with other risk factors for these events .
COCs have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events ( thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes ) .
This risk increases with age , particularly in women over 35 years of age who smoke .
• Use COCs with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors .
5 . 2 Liver Disease Impaired Liver Function Do not use Nymyo in women with liver disease , such as acute viral hepatitis or severe ( decompensated ) cirrhosis of liver [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded .
Discontinue Nymyo if jaundice develops .
Liver Tumors Nymyo is contraindicated in women with benign and malignant liver tumors [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Hepatic adenomas are associated with COC use .
An estimate of the attributable risk is 3 . 3 cases per 100 , 000 COC users .
Rupture of hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra - abdominal hemorrhage .
Studies have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long - term ( > 8 years ) COC users .
However , the risk of liver cancers in COC users is less than one case per million users .
5 . 3 Risk of Liver Enzyme Elevations with Concomitant Hepatitis C Treatment During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir , ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) , including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN , were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol - containing medications , such as COCs .
Discontinue Nymyo prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
Nymyo can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen .
5 . 4 High Blood Pressure Nymyo is contraindicated in women with uncontrolled hypertension or hypertension with vascular disease [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
For women with well - controlled hypertension , monitor blood pressure and stop Nymyo if blood pressure rises significantly .
An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking COCs , and this increase is more likely in older women with extended duration of use .
The incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestin .
5 . 5 Gallbladder Disease Studies suggest a small increased relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among COC users .
Use of COCs may worsen existing gallbladder disease .
A past history of COC - related cholestasis predicts an increased risk with subsequent COC use .
Women with a history of pregnancy - related cholestasis may be at an increased risk for COC related cholestasis .
5 . 6 Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Carefully monitor prediabetic and diabetic women who take Nymyo .
COCs may decrease glucose tolerance .
Consider alternative contraception for women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias .
A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while on COCs .
Women with hypertriglyceridemia , or a family history thereof , may be at an increased risk of pancreatitis when using COCs .
5 . 7 Headache If a woman taking Nymyo develops new headaches that are recurrent , persistent , or severe , evaluate the cause and discontinue Nymyo if indicated .
Consider discontinuation of Nymyo in the case of increased frequency or severity of migraine during COC use ( which may be prodromal of a cerebrovascular event ) .
5 . 8 Bleeding Irregularities and Amenorrhea Unscheduled Bleeding and Spotting Unscheduled ( breakthrough or intracyclic ) bleeding and spotting sometimes occur in patients on COCs , especially during the first three months of use .
If bleeding persists or occurs after previously regular cycles , check for causes such as pregnancy or malignancy .
If pathology and pregnancy are excluded , bleeding irregularities may resolve over time or with a change to a different contraceptive product .
In clinical trials of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol Tablets 0 . 25 mg / 0 . 035 mg , the frequency and duration of breakthrough bleeding and / or spotting was assessed in 1 , 647 patients ( 21 , 275 evaluable cycles ) and 4 , 826 patients ( 35 , 546 evaluable cycles ) , respectively .
A total of 100 ( 7 . 5 % ) women discontinued norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol Tablets 0 . 25 mg / 0 . 035 mg , at least in part , due to bleeding or spotting .
Based on data from the clinical trials , 14 - 34 % of women using norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol Tablets 0 . 25 mg / 0 . 035 mg experienced unscheduled bleeding per cycle in the first year .
The percent of women who experienced breakthrough / unscheduled bleeding tended to decrease over time .
Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea Women who use Nymyo may experience amenorrhea .
Some women may experience amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea after discontinuation of COCs , especially when such a condition was pre - existent .
If scheduled ( withdrawal ) bleeding does not occur , consider the possibility of pregnancy .
If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed dosing schedule ( missed one or more active tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have ) , consider the possibility of pregnancy at the time of the first missed period and take appropriate diagnostic measures .
If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods , rule out pregnancy .
5 . 9 COC Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy .
Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect , particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned , when oral contraceptives are taken inadvertently during early pregnancy .
Discontinue Nymyo use if pregnancy is confirmed .
Administration of COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8 . 1 ) ] .
5 . 10 Depression Carefully observe women with a history of depression and discontinue Nymyo if depression recurs to a serious degree .
5 . 11 Carcinoma of the Breast and Cervix • Nymyo is contraindicated in women who currently have or have had breast cancer because breast cancer may be hormonally sensitive [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ] .
There is substantial evidence that COCs do not increase the incidence of breast cancer .
Although some past studies have suggested that COCs might increase the incidence of breast cancer , more recent studies have not confirmed such findings .
• Some studies suggest that COC use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical cancer or intraepithelial neoplasia .
However , there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors .
5 . 12 Effect on Binding Globulins The estrogen component of COCs may raise the serum concentrations of thyroxine - binding globulin , sex hormone - binding globulin , and cortisol - binding globulin .
The dose of replacement thyroid hormone or cortisol therapy may need to be increased .
5 . 13 Monitoring A woman who is taking COCs should have a yearly visit with her healthcare provider for a blood pressure check and for other indicated healthcare .
5 . 14 Hereditary Angioedema In women with hereditary angioedema , exogenous estrogens may induce or exacerbate symptoms of angioedema .
5 . 15 Chloasma Chloasma may occasionally occur , especially in women with a history of chloasma gravidarum .
Women with a tendency to chloasma should avoid exposure to the sun or ultraviolet radiation while taking Nymyo .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials ( ≥ 2 % ) were : headache / migraine , abdominal / gastrointestinal pain , vaginal infection , genital discharge , breast issues ( including breast pain , discharge , and enlargement ) , mood disorders ( including depression and mood altered ) , flatulence , nervousness , rash .

The safety of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol 0 . 25 mg / 0 . 035 mg tablets was evaluated in 1 , 647 healthy women of child - bearing potential who participated in 3 clinical trials and received at least 1 dose of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol 0 . 25 mg / 0 . 035 mg tablets for contraception .
Two trials were randomized active - controlled trials and 1 was an uncontrolled open - label trial .
In all 3 trials , subjects were followed for up to 24 cycles .

Cysts and Polyps ) : Breast cancer , benign breast neoplasm , hepatic adenoma , focal nodular hyperplasia , breast cyst ; Immune System Disorders : Hypersensitivity ; Metabolism and Nutrition Disorders : Dyslipidemia ; Psychiatric Disorders : Anxiety , insomnia ; Nervous System Disorders : Syncope , convulsion , paresthesia , dizziness ; Eye Disorders : Visual impairment , dry eye , contact lens intolerance ; Ear and Labyrinth Disorders : Vertigo ; Cardiac Disorders : Tachycardia , palpitations ; Vascular Events : Deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , retinal vascular thrombosis , hot flush ; Arterial Events : Arterial thromboembolism , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ; Respiratory , Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders : Dyspnea ; Gastrointestinal Disorders : Pancreatitis , abdominal distension , diarrhea , constipation ; Hepatobiliary Disorders : Hepatitis ; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders : Angioedema , erythema nodosum , hirsutism , night sweats , hyperhidrosis , photosensitivity reaction , urticaria , pruritus , acne ; Musculoskeletal , Connective Tissue , and Bone Disorders : Muscle spasms , pain in extremity , myalgia , back pain ; Reproductive System and Breast Disorders : Ovarian cyst , suppressed lactation , vulvovaginal dryness ; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions : Chest pain , asthenic conditions .
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes including CYP3A4 , may decrease the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding .
Counsel patients to use a back - up method or alternative method of contraception when enzyme inducers are used with COCs .
( 7 . 1 ) Consult the labeling of concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations .
No drug - drug interaction studies were conducted with Nymyo .
7 . 1 Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Oral Contraceptives Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs : Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes , including cytochrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) , may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of COCs or increase breakthrough bleeding .
Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include phenytoin , barbiturates , carbamazepine , bosentan , felbamate , griseofulvin , oxcarbazepine , rifampicin , topiramate , rifabutin , rufinamide , aprepitant , and products containing St . John ' s wort .
Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and / or contraceptive failure .
Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back - up method when enzyme inducers are used with COCs , and to continue back - up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability .
Colesevelam : Colesevelam , a bile acid sequestrant , given together with a COC , has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE .
The drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart .
Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs : Co - administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing ethinyl estradiol ( EE ) increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20 - 25 % .
Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations , possibly by inhibition of conjugation .
CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole , voriconazole , fluconazole , grapefruit juice , or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations .
Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) / Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) protease inhibitors andnon - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors : Significant changes ( increase or decrease ) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and / or progestin have been noted in some cases of co - administration with HIV protease inhibitors ( decrease [ e . g . , nelfinavir , ritonavir , darunavir / ritonavir , ( fos ) amprenavir / ritonavir , lopinavir / ritonavir , and tipranavir / ritonavir ] or increase [ e . g . , indinavir and atazanavir / ritonavir ] ) / HCV protease inhibitors ( decrease [ e . g . , boceprevir and telaprevir ] ) or with non - nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( decrease [ e . g . , nevirapine ] or increase [ e . g . , etravirine ] ) .
7 . 2 Effects of Combined Oral Contraceptives on Other Drugs ● COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds ( e . g . , cyclosporine , prednisolone , theophylline , tizanidine , and voriconazole ) and increase their plasma concentrations .
● COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen , clofibric acid , morphine , salicylic acid , temazepam and lamotrigine .
Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown , likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation .
This may reduce seizure control ; therefore , dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary .
Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because the serum concentration of thyroid - binding globulin increases with use of COCs .
7 . 3 Interactions with Laboratory Tests The use of contraceptive steroids may influence the results of certain laboratory tests , such as coagulation factors , lipids , glucose tolerance , and binding proteins .
7 . 4 Concomitant Use with HCV Combination Therapy – Liver Enzyme Elevation Do not co - administer Nymyo with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir / paritaprevir / ritonavir , with or without dasabuvir , due to potential for ALT elevations [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 3 ) ] .
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing mothers : Not recommended ; can decrease milk production .
( 8 . 3 ) 8 . 1 Pregnancy There is little or no increased risk of birth defects in women who inadvertently use COCs during early pregnancy .
Epidemiologic studies and meta - analyses have not found an increased risk of genital or non - genital birth defects ( including cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects ) following exposure to low dose COCs prior to conception or during early pregnancy .
Do not administer COCs to induce withdrawal bleeding as a test for pregnancy .
Do not use COCs during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion .
8 . 3 Nursing Mothers Advise the nursing mother to use other forms of contraception , when possible , until she has weaned her child .
COCs can reduce milk production in breastfeeding mothers .
This is less likely to occur once breastfeeding is well - established ; however , it can occur at any time in some women .
Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids and / or metabolites are present in breast milk .
8 . 4 Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets have been established in women of reproductive age .
Efficacy is expected to be the same for post - pubertal adolescents under the age of 18 and for users 18 years and older .
Use of this product before menarche is not indicated .
8 . 5 Geriatric Use Nymyo has not been studied in postmenopausal women and are not indicated in this population .
8 . 6 Hepatic Impairment The pharmacokinetics of Nymyo has not been studied in subjects with hepatic impairment .
However , steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with hepatic impairment .
Acute or chronic disturbances of liver function may necessitate the discontinuation of COC use until markers of liver function return to normal and COC causation has been excluded .
[ See Contraindications ( 4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5 . 2 ) ] .
8 . 7 Renal Impairment The pharmacokinetics of Nymyo has not been studied in women with renal impairment .
10 OVERDOSAGE There have been no reports of serious ill effects from overdosage of oral contraceptives , including ingestion by children .
Overdosage may cause withdrawal bleeding in females and nausea .
11 DESCRIPTION Nymyo is a combination oral contraceptive containing the progestational compound norgestimate and the estrogenic compound ethinyl estradiol .
Norgestimate is designated as ( 18 , 19 - Dinor - 17 - pregn - 4 - en - 20 - yn - 3 - one , 17 - ( acetyloxy ) - 13 - ethyl - , oxime , ( 17α ) ( + ) - ) and ethinyl estradiol is designated as ( 19 - nor - 17α - pregna , 1 , 3 , 5 ( 10 ) - trien - 20 - yne - 3 , 17 - diol ) .
• Each active blue tablet contains 0 . 250 mg of norgestimate and 0 . 035 mg of ethinyl estradiol .

[ MULTIMEDIA ] [ MULTIMEDIA ] 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12 . 1 Mechanism of Action COCs lower the risk of becoming pregnant primarily by suppressing ovulation .
Other possible mechanisms may include cervical mucus changes that inhibit sperm penetration and endometrial changes that reduce the likelihood of implantation .
12 . 2 Pharmacodynamics No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted with Nymyo .
12 . 3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Norgestimate ( NGM ) and EE are rapidly absorbed following oral administration .
NGM is rapidly and completely metabolized by first pass ( intestinal and / or hepatic ) mechanisms to norelgestromin ( NGMN ) and norgestrel ( NG ) , which are the major active metabolites of norgestimate .
Peak serum concentrations of NGMN and EE are generally reached by 2 hours after administration of norgestimate and ethinyl estradiol tablets .
Accumulation following multiple dosing of the 250 mcg NGM / 35 mcg EE dose is approximately 2 - fold for NGMN and EE compared with single dose administration .
The pharmacokinetics of NGMN is dose - proportional following NGM doses of 180 mcg to 250 mcg .
Steady - state concentration of EE is achieved by Day 7 of each dosing cycle .
Steady - state concentrations of NGMN and NG are achieved by Day 21 .
Non - linear accumulation ( approximately 8 fold ) of NG is observed as a result of high - affinity binding to SHBG , which limits its biological activity ( Table 3 ) .
[ MULTIMEDIA ] Food Effect The effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of Nymyo has not been studied .
Distribution NGMN and NG are highly bound ( > 97 % ) to serum proteins .
NGMN is bound to albumin and not to SHBG , while NG is bound primarily to SHBG .
EE is extensively bound ( > 97 % ) to serum albumin and induces an increase in the serum concentrations of SHBG .
Metabolism NGM is extensively metabolized by first - pass mechanisms in the gastrointestinal tract and / or liver .
NGM ' s primary active metabolite is NGMN .
Subsequent hepatic metabolism of NGMN occurs and metabolites include NG , which is also active , and various hydroxylated and conjugated metabolites .
Although NGMN and its metabolites inhibit a variety of P450 enzymes in human liver microsomes , under the recommended dosing regimen , the in vivo concentrations of NGMN and its metabolites , even at the peak serum levels , are relatively low compared to the inhibitory constant ( Ki ) .
EE is also metabolized to various hydroxylated products and their glucuronide and sulfate conjugates .
Excretion The metabolites of NGMN and EE are eliminated by renal and fecal pathways .
Following administration of 14 C - norgestimate , 47 % ( 45 - 49 % ) and 37 % ( 16 - 49 % ) of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and feces , respectively .
Unchanged NGM was not detected in the urine .
In addition to 17 - deacetyl norgestimate , a number of metabolites of NGM have been identified in human urine following administration of radiolabeled NGM .
