EXTERNAL RADIATION The specific gamma ray constant for Indium In 111 is 3 . 3 R / hr - mCi at 1 cm .
The half - value thickness of lead ( Pb ) for Indium In 111 is 0 . 021 cm .
To facilitate control of the radiation exposure from millicurie amounts of this radionuclide , a range of values for the relative attenuation of the radiation emitted by this radionuclide that results from interposition of various thicknesses of Pb is shown in Table 2 .
For example , the use of a 0 . 8 cm thickness of Pb will attenuate the radiation emitted by a factor of about 1 , 000 .

In normal individuals , the radiopharmaceutical will have ascended to the parasagittal region within 24 hours with simultaneous partial or complete clearance of activity from the basal cisterns and Sylvian regions .
In contrast to air , the radiopharmaceutical does not normally enter the cerebral ventricles .
Although the primary absorption of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) into the blood stream occurs at the arachnoid villi , there is some evidence that a significant fraction of CSF is also absorbed across both the cerebral and spinal leptomeninges .
Lesser quantities may also be absorbed across the ventricular ependyma .
It is also generally held that these alternate routes of CSF absorption may assume primary importance when the major routes of the flow are pathologically obstructed .
Approximately 65 % of the administered dose is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours and this increases to 85 % in 72 hours .
INDICATIONS AND USAGE Pentetate Indium Disodium In 111 is recommended for use in radionuclide cisternography .
CONTRAINDICATIONS None known .
WARNINGS The contents of the vial are radioactive .
Adequate shielding of the preparation must be maintained at all times .
Since the drug is excreted by the kidneys , caution should be exercised in patients with severely impaired renal function .
PRECAUTIONS General Pentetate Indium Disodium In 111 , as well as other radioactive drugs , must be handled with care and appropriate safety measures should be used to minimize external radiation exposure to clinical personnel , and to minimize radiation exposure to patients consistent with proper patient management .
Radiopharmaceuticals should be used only by physicians who are qualified by training and experience in the safe use and handling of radionuclides , and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate government agency authorized to license the use of radionuclides .
Do not use after the expiration time and date ( 7 days after calibration time and date stated on the label ) .
Discard vial after a single use .
Do not use if contents are turbid .
Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis , Impairment of Fertility No long - term animal studies have been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential , mutagenic potential , or whether Pentetate lndium Disodium In 111 affects fertility in males or females .
Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with GE Healthcare ( Medi - Physics , Inc . ) Indium DTPA In 111 .
Also , it is not known whether Pentetate Indium Disodium In 111 can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity .
Pentetate Indium Disodium In 111 should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed .
Ideally , examinations using radiopharmaceuticals , especially those elective in nature , of a woman of childbearing capability should be performed during the first few ( approximately 10 ) days following the onset of menses .
Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk .
Because many drugs are excreted in human milk , formula feedings should be substituted for breast feedings when Pentetate Indium Disodium In 111 is administered to a nursing mother .
Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established .
Geriatric use Clinical studies of Indium DTPA In 111 did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects .
Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients .
In general , dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious , usually starting at the low end of the dosing range , reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic , renal , or cardiac function , and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy .
The drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney , and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function .
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function , care should be taken in dose selection , and it may be useful to monitor renal function .
ADVERSE REACTIONS Aseptic meningitis and pyrogenic reactions have been rarely ( less than 0 . 4 % ) observed following cisternography with Pentetate lndium Disodium In 111 .
One death has been reported to have occurred within 20 minutes following the administration of Pentetate Indium Disodium In 111 and appears to be drug related .
In addition , two cases of septic meningitis have also been reported .
There have also been reports of skin reactions and vomiting following administration of Pentetate lndium Disodium In 111 .
Relationship of the drug to these latter occurrences has not been established .
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Extreme care must be exercised to assure aseptic conditions in intrathecal injections .
The maximum recommended intrathecal dose in the average patient ( 70 kg ) is 18 . 5 MBq , 500 µCi .
The patient dose should be measured by a suitable radioactivity calibration system immediately prior to administration .
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit .
RADIATION DOSIMETRY The estimated absorbed radiation doses null to selected organs of an average ( 70 kg ) patient from intrathecal administration of a maximum dose of 18 . 5 MBq , 500 µCi of Pentetate Indium Disodium In 111 are shown in Table 4 .
